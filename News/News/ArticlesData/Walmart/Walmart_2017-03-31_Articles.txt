However, surveillance video later showed the man himself bringing the venomous snake into the store, a Walmart spokesperson told the station. No one else was injured, but the snake sighting caused pandemonium, according to customer Linda Moore Mathews, who snapped a photo of the reptile as it lay coiled in the middle of a produce aisle and posted it on Facebook. “Everyone was freaking out,” Mathews said. Another woman recorded video of a man finally catching the copperhead and placing it in a Walmart bag. The snake was de-fanged, which is usually done to snakes kept as pets, according to Jacksonville Animal Control, but the venomous glands weren’t removed. The man was taken to an area medical center for treatment according to KTHV; his condition is not yet known.

Renato Munteanu used a fake Nevada driver’s license on Tuesday at a Walmart at 365 Lake Marian Rd. in Carpentersville to access $1,500 that was sent to a MoneyGram account as part of an online scam, according to Carpentersville police. Munteanu had no fixed address over the last few months, police said. On Tuesday, someone in North Carolina filed a complaint with Carpentersville police about a suspicious incident that took place at the Walmart, police said. She told police that she sent $1,500 to a MoneyGram account to purchase an item she had viewed on Craigslist, which was allegedly sold using eBay Buying Protection Services. Investigators requested video of the transaction on Tuesday, police said. The following day, a Walmart employee identified Munteanu when he returned to the store and alerted authorities. At the time of his arrest, Munteanu had two fake Nevada driver’s licenses in his possession, police said. In addition, police found computers and printers used for making fake IDs and more than $50,000 in cash in his rented vehicle. Munteanu was charged with continuing financial criminal enterprise, theft, two counts of issue or deliver forged document and two counts of possession or display fictitious ID card — all felonies. He was also charged with a misdemeanor count of possession of identification material hardware or software, police said. Munteanu’s bond was set at $400,000 Friday afternoon, police said. # Crime Carpentersville Previously from Chicago News 7 dead in 3 separate shootings in South Shore neighborhood – Chicago Sun-Times Burnett wants to yank out median planters that cost city millions – Chicago Sun-Times UIC men’s swimmer accused of taking video of women’s locker room – Chicago Sun-Times CPD's Johnson: 7 South Shore murders not random acts of violence Stories from around the web you may like Currently Trending chicago news 7 dead in 3 separate shootings in South Shore neighborhood – Chicago Sun-Times chicago news Danny Davis’ son, whose own boy was killed last year, has died – Chicago Sun-Times chicago Burnett wants to yank out median planters that cost city millions – Chicago Sun-Times bears Safety first?

(Roberto E. Rosales/Journal) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... Clifford Miller, 42. (Courtesy of the Tulsa World) ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — The Oklahoma man found decapitated and mutilated behind a northeast Albuquerque Wal-Mart last December was dead before his head was cut off, according to an autopsy report from the Office of the Medical Investigator. The report indicates 42-year-old Clifford Miller died from seven stab wounds to his torso, including multiple stab wounds to his back, abdomen and chest. His body also showed cuts and bruises and multiple smaller wounds. Miller, who friends say had moved to Albuquerque for work and who had become homeless when the work dried up, was originally from McAlester, Okla. Advertisement Continue reading Shortly after midnight on Dec. 17, a security guard found his naked body missing its head and genitals behind a Wal-Mart on Wyoming near Menaul NE. His gruesome death shocked the city and made national news. Police said at the time they didn’t believe he was killed at the Wal-Mart but they wouldn’t say where they believe he was slain. They didn’t announce any suspects. More than three months later, detectives don’t have any more details about the case, according to Albuquerque police spokesman Fred Duran. But an autopsy released Friday gives a couple of additional clues to the circumstances surrounding Miller’s death. The report showed that Miller had used marijuana before he was killed and had enough alcohol in his system to possibly be unconscious. It also showed that he had sperm on his left leg that could belong to him or his assailant. The Office of the Medical Investigator did not return phone calls requesting more information. Duran also did not answer when asked if the DNA was Miller’s or if it pointed to another person. “Any evidence collected will be processed at the lab if this is possible depending on what evidence could be collected and will be turned over to detectives,” Duran wrote in an email.

Gen. L. Scott Rice, director of the Air National Guard, toured Guard facilities in central Arkansas, Fort Smith and traveled to Northwest Arkansas to meet with execs at Wal-Mart Stores and Tyson Foods. He wrapped up his three-day tour Friday (March 31) in Fort Smith with a visit to the 188th Wing and a luncheon hosted by the Fort Smith Regional Chamber of Commerce. Rice, a command pilot with more than 4,300 flight hours, manages the Pentagon office responsible for more than 105,500 Guard members and civilians in more than 90 wings and 175 units at 213 locations in the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam and the Virgin Islands, according to his Air Force biography. On Wednesday Rice attended the graduation of the first class at the Air National Guard Cyber Skills Validation Course at Little Rock Air Force Base. He also received a briefing on the 189th Airlift Wing Mission, traveled on a C-130H to view select ranges and facilities, and attended a luncheon with the Little Rock Community Council, according to a statement from the office of U.S. Sen. John Boozman, R-Ark. Rice held an Airmen’s Call at the 189th Airlift Wing with about 450 members of the wing. “Two things stand out in our visit here. First, the units here in Arkansas clearly show why they are amongst the best. Highly specialized, highly trained professional forces is what we have here in the state. Second, the overwhelming support the communities show for their Air Guard is unmatched,” Rice noted in a statement. With Boozman and U.S. Rep. Steve Womack, R-Rogers, serving as tour guides, Rice traveled to Northwest Arkansas. While that region does not have an Air Guard facility, it does have a military connection, Womack said. “He (Rice) wanted to talk to Wal-Mart about their veterans hiring. He wanted to talk to Tyson about their logistics chain because they provide a lot of product for the Department of Defense,” Womack explained. Fort Smith Regional Chamber of Commerce President Tim Allen visits Friday with Lt. Gen. L. Scott Rice, director of the Air National Guard. Another part of that connection is the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps program at the University of Arkansas. Rice was able to spend some quality time with program cadets, Womack said. “Those cadets will not get an opportunity to have a 3-star (general) in a leadership position like that talk to them very often,” Womack added. UNIQUE MISSIONS Womack also said the 188th may be based in Fort Smith, but it has an impact on its neighbors to the north. “We plugged him in to what we felt like would be a really good indicator of the region where this 188th happens to operate,” Womack told Talk Business & Politics in explaining what he viewed as an added benefit for Rice to see what is happening in Northwest Arkansas. Rice is the first Air Guard director to visit the 188th since its transformation from a manned flight mission to a remotely piloted aircraft – drone – unit. Broad cuts in U.S. defense spending included the removal of 20 A-10 fighter planes from the 188th Fighter Wing in Fort Smith. It was announced in 2012 that the unit’s mission would change to an intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) mission. The unit converted to the new mission in June 2014. “We’re doing things here that are unique for the entire country,” Boozman said Friday when asked if Rice’s visit helps the 188th and state avoid being on the wrong end of any future Base Realignment and Closure cycle. “Because they are doing such a great job, I think that the mission, and the budget is very secure. And certainly the delegation is going to be working very hard to make sure that is the case.” Boozman also said that applies to the 189th Airlift Wing at the Little Rock Air Force Base in Jacksonville because of the unique training for crews of the C-130 transport plane. MORE ‘FORCE STRUCTURE’ Womack said his focus Friday was to show Rice that the Air Force should do more in the Fort Smith area. “And then to come down here today to see exactly what is going on with the missions of the 188th, and to kind of reinforce the sale of what we have been telling him. Senator Boozman and I have been strong advocates for getting more force structure into this region, for a lot of reasons. We’ve got an airspace that we ought to take advantage of. Proximity to places like Fort Chaffee. We’ve got a low cost of living here. We’ve got the Fort Smith airfield, the established reputation of the 188th, a supportive community. I mean, you can’t find a more opportunistic place for more force structure for the Air Guard,” Womack said. The Air Guard could soon have more money. President Donald Trump has proposed an estimated $60 billion increase for the Department of Defense budget. Rice told Talk Business & Politics that much of what the Air Guard might receive from the budget bump will be to support units with manned flying missions. “As the Air Force spreads that money out, a piece of it all goes to the three components within the Air Force; the Reserves, the Active Duty and the Guard. And we’re receiving a piece of that, and we’re going to increase some of our full-time manning, and particularly in maintenance of our aircraft. … We’re going to add more bodies to the flight line to keep those older aircraft flying.” Comments comments Previous post Northwest Arkansas economic expansion includes tech and manufacturing Talk Business & Politics by email Arkansas headlines delivered to you on demand Email address Statewide Newsletter Northeast Arkansas Newsletter Fort Smith Newsletter Northwest Arkansas Newsletter Submit Advertisement Search Talk Business & Politics Search for: Opinion Gov.

Elizabeth Thomas & Tad Cummins Sighting Update Published 2:31 pm EDT, March 31, 2017 Updated 6:16 pm EDT, March 31, 2017 5 Comments By Jessica McBride 2.6k Share Tweet Share Email Follow Tad Cummins and Elizabeth Thomas at an Oklahoma Walmart. (TBI) Tennessee authorities hunting for a missing teacher and his student say there’s been a confirmed sighting of the pair at an Oklahoma City Walmart. They also say that teacher Tad Cummins and student Elizabeth Thomas appear to have dyed their hair – with Thomas now having red hair. The tip came in on March 30, just over two weeks after Cummins and Thomas were captured on video at the Walmart. Authorities – who have launched an aggressive manhunt for the pair – are trying to figure out which car they drove there. It’s not clear whether the Tennessee teacher and student are still in Oklahoma. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation released a series of new photos on March 31 that they say is high school health teacher Cummins and freshman Thomas. It’s the first confirmed sighting of Thomas and Cummins; the day before, in Tennessee, there was another reported sighting, but it was later declared false. Elizabeth Thomas at the Walmart. (TBI) Here’s how they looked before vanishing: Tad Cummins and Elizabeth Thomas. (TBI and Twitter photos) “Investigators obtained surveillance images from a Walmart on East I-240 Service Road in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma from the afternoon of March 15th, showing Tad Cummins and Elizabeth Thomas shopping at the store,” the TBI wrote in an update to its Amber Alert in the Thomas case. “Cummins used cash to purchase various food items, but did not purchase anything else of significance.” Cummins and Thomas. (TBI) Cummins, 50, and Thomas, 15, have been on the run since mid March, when they vanished in the midst of an investigation into a complaint that Cummins, who has now been fired, was seen kissing Thomas in a classroom. Cummins taught at Culleoka High School in Tennessee. Cummins’ wife, Jill, has publicly urged her husband to return the teen. Before they vanished, both Cummins and Thomas made extensive posts about love on Instagram, although the teen mixed her love posts with those about depression and even death. Authorities say that Thomas was abused in the home. Thomas calls herself “wife” on Instagram, and posted a graphic from Beauty and the Beast around the time she vanished that says “every beauty needs her beast to protect her from everything but him.” Elizabeth Thomas’ father took to Twitter and posted several photos of his missing daughter, including this one. The father urged his daughter to come home and asked for the public’s help in finding her. (Twitter) According to the TBI, “Thomas is a 15-year-old white female, with hazel eyes, stands 5’0” and weighs 120 pounds. She was last seen wearing a flannel shirt and black leggings. Cummins is a white male, who stands 6’0”, weighs approximately 200 pounds, and has brown hair and eyes.” Tad Cummins on March 15. (TBI) Authorities say they believe Cummins is “armed with two handguns and driving a silver Nissan Rogue with Tennessee tag 976-ZPT. A warrant has been issued for Cummins for Sexual Contact with a Minor and Aggravated Kidnapping. On Friday, the TBI added him to the state’s ‘Top 10 Most Wanted’ list. There is a $1,000 reward for information leading to his capture.” As of March 31, the TBI, says it has received more than 1,200 tips from across the country. “The TBI would urge the public to remain vigilant and report any information that may prove beneficial in the ongoing search to 1-800-TBI-FIND. If you spot the vehicle and can verify the license plate to be TN 976-ZPT, call 911 immediately,” the authorities say. On March 20, one week after Cummins and Thomas disappeared, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation released this photo of Cummins. It was taken shortly before he vanished. The teacher and student were still on the run. The Walmart pictures, taken after this one, indicate he has tried to alter his appearance by darkening his hair. (TBI) Authorities accused Cummins of grooming Thomas for abuse by playing on her problems at home. According to WSMV, Thomas was home schooled until her freshman year of high school. The television station quoted the local district attorney as saying her home life was a troubled one. The television station reported that “police arrested Elizabeth’s mother, Kimberly Thomas, last year. She was charged with five counts of child abuse and neglect. According to court documents, Kimberly Thomas beat Elizabeth and four of her siblings.” Read more about the social media posts of Cummins and Thomas here: READ: Elizabeth Thomas & Tad Cummins Social Media Posts Elizabeth Thomas and Tad Cummins posted on Instagram before the student and teacher went missing.

Only a matter of time…also I’d suspect looking at her demeanor, she’s a willing participant. It’s not like he’s captured her by the looks of it. Reply Thomas Sullivan says: March 31, 2017 at 8:05 pm Hopefully you understand that she’s not a “willing participant” because she’s 15 years old. ‘Captured’ can mean many things other then the physical. Plenty of evidence that he’s groomed her and has her under his control. Notice she’s behind him and acting subserviently. Reply Anonymous says: March 31, 2017 at 3:00 pm Well he better be banging her as much as possible, because once he gets caught that will be the last piece of tail he is going to get lol Reply Alan Falleur says: March 31, 2017 at 6:50 pm What the hell? Is he just driving down I-40 as bold as he pleases? They got a BOLO alert out on his vehicle, so how come the damn highway patrol haven’t pulled that car over yet? Or has he changed vehicles?

Skip to content comics cosplay tv/film games Submit tip Contact CGC Insider Search for: Here Comes All Of The Wonder Woman You Can Handle Posted by Jeremy Konrad March 31, 2017 Comment Well, if you are excited/already love the Wonder Woman film starring Gal Galdot, you will probably want to head to your local Walmart in April.

After receiving a tip late Thursday, investigators obtained surveillance images showing 15-year-old Elizabeth Thomas and 50-year-old Tad Cummins at the store the afternoon of March 15, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said. The Walmart surveillance images showed Cummins “with an altered appearance to darken his hair,” the TBI said. “The same images show Elizabeth may currently have red hair,” the TBI added. Cummins used cash to buy food at the Walmart but he didn’t buy “anything else of significance,” the TBI said. “Efforts to determine what vehicle they were traveling in remain ongoing.” It’s the first confirmed sighting of the pair since Cummins was accused of kidnapping Elizabeth on March 13. Cummins, who was fired one day after the alleged kidnapping, is wanted on allegations of aggravated kidnapping and sexual contact with a minor. An Amber Alert has been issued for Elizabeth. The TBI said it has received more than 1,200 tips as of Friday morning. Josh DeVine, a TBI spokesman, said Tuesday the TBI was “optimistic” about the outcome of the case, saying it takes only one lead “to turn this thing around.” The TBI said that Cummins “may have been abusing his role as a teacher to groom [the teen] … in an effort to lure and potentially sexually exploit her.” One of Elizabeth’s schoolmates reported seeing her and Cummins kiss in his classroom on Jan. 23, according to a school district investigative report, but both denied the claim. A school report from January reads that neither one “admitted to behaving inappropriately towards the other.” Cummins, a married father and grandfather, researched teen marriage online, specifically the age of consent, according to law enforcement officials. An attorney for the Thomas family, Jason Whatley, told ABC News last week that Cummins “preyed on her.” “She is under his spell, and she is being controlled by him, and that is what is so scary,” Whatley said. Mark Gwyn, the director of the TBI, said this week, “This is not a fairy tale. This is a case of kidnapping.” “She may not realize she’s in danger. She may not realize she’s been taken against her will,” Brent Cooper, the district attorney for Maury County, told ABC News this week. “If you see them and they look happy, that doesn’t matter. This is a serious crime.” Cummins is described as 6 feet tall and about 200 pounds. He may be driving a 2015 silver Nissan Rogue with Tennessee license plate number 976-ZPT. Elizabeth is described as about 5 feet tall. She was last seen wearing leggings and a flannel shirt. Authorities are asking that anyone with information call 1-800-TBI-FIND and that anyone who sees a car with Tennessee license plate number 976-ZPT call 911. Copyright © 2017, ABC Radio.

Many of America’s biggest corporations including Apple Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. are sticking by their pledges to fight climate change even as President Donald Trump guts his predecessor’s environmental policies. (Photo: Pool / Getty Images) 3 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE Many of America’s biggest corporations including Apple Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. are sticking by their pledges to fight climate change even as President Donald Trump guts his predecessor’s environmental policies. Companies say their promises, coordinated by the Obama administration, reflect their push to cut energy costs, head off activist pressure and address a risk to their bottom line in the decades to come. “This work is embedded in our business,” Wal-Mart spokesman Kevin Gardner said in an email. It’s “good for the business, our shareholders and customers; if ultimately we are able to positively impact the environment in the process, that’s a win too.” Wal-Mart was one of 81 companies that promised to reduce emissions in the run up to the 2015 Paris global climate negotiations. The company upped its targets last November, saying it would get half its power from renewable sources by 2025. Trump signed an order Tuesday that tells the Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider former President Barack Obama’s climate rules, and rescinds a series of orders Obama issued to embed consideration of climate change in government actions from where to lease buildings to whether to allow oil pipelines to be built. Companies need to move ahead on the climate change front no matter what Trump’s government does, Geoffrey M. Heal, a professor at Columbia Business School, said in a telephone interview. "They don’t have the luxury of denying,"Gina McCarthy, head of the EPA under Obama, said on Bloomberg Television. "They have to invest wisely." Business’s biggest lobbying force supports Trump on this issue. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce welcomed Trump’s order calling that shift “vital to stimulating economic growth.” The group argues that Obama’s regulations held back economic growth, preventing business owners from constructing needed pipelines, roads and other infrastructure. It also warned that the climate push would lead to a jump in energy prices. But many of the group’s members and other corporate titans supported Obama’s Clean Power Plan, or have set their own goals. Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s largest beer-maker, also announced Tuesday that it would get 100 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025. Nearly 90 companies have made similar pledges, according to the Sierra Club. "We believe climate change is real and the science is well accepted," General Electric Co.’s Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt, wrote in an internal blog post shared by the company. "We hope that the United States continues to play a constructive role in furthering solutions to these challenges, and at GE, we will continue to lead with our technology and actions." Mars Inc., the maker of M&M’s, committed to eliminating its emissions entirely by 2040. Andy Pharoah, vice president of corporate affairs, said that Mars is “disappointed the administration has decided to roll back climate regulations.” American competitiveness Technology companies including Apple, Amazon.com Inc, Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp. also expressed their support for Obama’s policies. “We believe that strong clean energy and climate policies, like the Clean Power Plan, can make renewable energy supplies more robust and address the serious threat of climate change while also supporting American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth,” the companies said in a joint statement after Trump’s order was signed. Other companies, while stopping short of criticizing the Trump administration, said they would keep pursuing lower emissions in their own operations.Procter & Gamble, Nestle Inc., Ikea, Levi Strauss & Co. and Best Buy Co., which all signed the 2015 pledge organized by the Obama administration, said they still intended to honor their commitments. “We will continue to integrate sustainability into our business practices, operations, innovation, brand building and culture,” Damon Jones, a spokesman for Procter & Gamble said. Many energy businesses welcomed Trump’s rollback. The Independent Petroleum Association of America, which represents oil and natural gas producers, joined the Chamber of Commerce in praising his move. So did the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenged the Clean Power Plan in court. “People are going to freeze in the dark because of the destruction of the reliable electric power grid under Obama and the Democrats,” Robert Murray, the president and CEO of coal-mining company Murray Energy Corp. said in an interview. “Mr. Trump is doing the right things.” Some environmental groups cautioned that action from the private sector, wasn’t enough to make up for the pullback in federal policy. “Policy is going to be required to get us where we need to be,” said Karen Palmer, research director at Resources for the Future.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive People’s inventions fuel American manufacturing Friday Mar 31, 2017 at 1:18 PM Mar 31, 2017 at 4:07 PM By Sam Asano If you visit Wal-Mart, you’ll see acres and acres of merchandise made in China or some other countries. Even though Wal-Mart does advertise that it is proud to carry American-made products, it isn’t easy to find them in the store among the ocean of foreign-made products. If you carefully look through the store, there aren’t many products that require a very high level of technology and assembly know-how. Most of what’s in the store is a collection of mundane everyday products that are needed and used in the average American households. The sad tragedy is that we no longer make these products, and buy them overseas, thus shrinking the jobs that used to be comprised and fed our massive, happy middle class. Being a right-wing Republican, I wish I’d agree with what Donald Trump prescribes as his national policy, but I do have some serious misgivings agreeing with his policy. However, one thing I do agree with is his “get the jobs back here in America” policy. Eighteen years ago, I attended a Harvard commencement. The keynote speaker was the then Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan. The public address system in the large Harvard Ground made hearing his speech difficult. But, I was jolted to hear him state that “if somebody can make products cheaper, let him do it by all means.” In fact I do not remember anything else from his speech but this statement. My immediate reaction was confusion with anger. He was the world renowned economist and the Federal Reserve Chairman. I was an owner of a small electronics manufacturing firm in Cambridge, and suffering serious competition from lower labor cost nations. My firm then employed about 160 people, but the fast growth we had experienced earlier had died down, and we were having hard time maintaining our once-prominent position in the market place. At that time there were some factions of economists and even politicians who theorized that we Americans shouldn’t dwell on insisting to manufacture mundane products. Let under-developed nations with cheaper labor do the manufacturing. Meanwhile, we Americans would end up developing much higher technology products, which only we would know how to manufacture. Advanced technology products would have a much higher margin, and that would absorb the higher labor cost. I was highly skeptical of the theory. I had thought that the theory was being advanced by people who knew nothing about manufacturing. However, the movement to let go of manufacturing to cheaper labor countries was overwhelmingly dominant. That was some 20 years ago. Now America has accumulated $20 trillion in national debt, the direct result of that irresponsible “national" policy. Yes, we owe $65,000 in debt for every man and woman alive in this country, including babies and retirees. No wonder economic growth has stagnated. When one owes a lot of money, he/she doesn’t spend money or enjoy life. For every four (yes, four) low-labor cost country laborers that take a job to manufacture products to be exported to America, one American loses his/her job. Yes, we have been supporting the under-developed nations by cutting our own employment and sending them to unemployment payrolls. What a demeaning thing to do to our own citizens. Yet, under the aegis of our nation’s policy to assist the world economy, this has been going on for some 40 years, all the while reducing our employment and cutting back our living standard. In the early 20th century up to 1970’s, we never had such international binding agreements as NAFTA or TPP. Yet, American products made here sold very well. America had many established brands, and people worldwide respected them and wanted to buy the products. What I would like to do in my minuscule power of influence is to bring back the tiny fragment of those glory days by prospering the basic manufacturing here. My column is now requesting its readers to invent something, and our committee consisting of various experts will judge, criticize and evaluate your inventions. Ones that pass the gate would be suitable and fit for manufacturing. The more such products appear, the more manufacturing opportunities rise. That is our idea. Like President Donald Trump would say, America is our number 1, and let’s get our jobs back. This column is a tiny effort toward that goal.

Elizabeth Thomas, 15, and Tad Cummins, 50, were seen at a Walmart on East I-240 Service Road in Oklahoma City, Okla., on March 15, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigations said. Thomas appeared to have dyed her hair dark red, while Cummins' beard was also darkened in what may have been an attempt to alter his appearance, surveillance images released by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) show. Cummins used cash to purchase various food items, but did not purchase anything else of significance, investigators said, noting they were still trying to determine what vehicle the pair was traveling in. The surveillance images came from a Walmart store about 700 miles from Maury County, Tenn., where Thomas was last seen before disappearing on March 13, and are the first images obtained by the TBI since Cummins allegedly picked up the teen after she was dropped off by a friend at a local Shoney’s restaurant, officials said. Read: Teacher Researched Teen Marriage Online Before Kidnapping 15-Year-Old Student: Investigators Cummins and Thomas were allegedly caught having "inappropriate contact" earlier this year, when another student saw them kissing in his classroom on January 23.   Both the teacher and student denied the incident, and Thomas was removed from Cummins’ class. They were also told to stay away from each other. But Thomas was reportedly seen in Cummins’ classroom again on February 3. Cummins was suspended at that point, and fired the day after he and Thomas disappeared. In the days before he allegedly kidnapped Thomas, Cummins is believed to have researched teen marriage and about his Nissan Rogue in an effort to learn if any of the car’s features could be tracked by law enforcement, authorities said. Brent Cooper, the district attorney for Maury County, said it’s possible that Cummins may have fled the country with Thomas, telling ABC News that the man is religious and familiar with missionary work. "He could easily blend into that kind of culture," Cooper said, noting that Cummins had previously invented a past for himself to appear more interesting to his students. Read: Brother of Teen Allegedly Kidnapped By Teacher: 'I Do Believe He Has Some Control Over Her' "He was kind of brainwashing all the kids into thinking he was something he wasn't," including a former FBI and CIA agent, Cooper said. "I'm sure all that played into Elizabeth's feelings toward him. It was a complete deception." As of Friday, the TBI has received more than 1,200 tips from across the country. Anyone with information is asked to call 1-800-TBI-FIND, or to call 911 immediately if Cummins’ vehicle is spotted.

After receiving a tip late Thursday, investigators obtained surveillance images showing 15-year-old Elizabeth Thomas and 50-year-old Tad Cummins at the store the afternoon of March 15, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said. The Walmart surveillance images showed Cummins “with an altered appearance to darken his hair,” the TBI said. “The same images show Elizabeth may currently have red hair,” the TBI added. Early on, we issued the picture on the left, from several days before the #TNAMBERAlert, Note the apparent change in Tad’s appearance. pic.twitter.com/ZaET35u0C7 — TBI (@TBInvestigation) March 31, 2017 Cummins used cash to buy food at the Walmart but he didn’t buy “anything else of significance,” the TBI said. “Efforts to determine what vehicle they were traveling in remain ongoing.” It’s the first confirmed sighting of the pair since Cummins was accused of kidnapping Elizabeth on March 13. Cummins, who was fired one day after the alleged kidnapping, is wanted on allegations of aggravated kidnapping and sexual contact with a minor. An Amber Alert has been issued for Elizabeth.

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said a tip late Thursday led investigators to obtain surveillance images from a Walmart on East I-240 Service Road in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, from the afternoon of March 15, showing Elizabeth Thomas and 50-year-old Tad Cummins shopping at the store. The images – the first obtained by investigators since the alleged kidnapping March 13 – clearly show Tad Cummins with an altered appearance to darken his hair. The same images show Elizabeth may have red hair. Efforts to determine what vehicle they were traveling in remained ongoing. Authorities believe Thomas was kidnapped by Cummins, a former teacher at her school in Maury County. The school district terminated Cummins in the wake of an ongoing investigation into alleged inappropriate contact he had with Thomas at the school earlier this year. Thomas is a white female, has hazel eyes, stands 5 feet tall and weighs 120 pounds. She was last seen wearing a flannel shirt and black leggings. Cummins is a white male, stands 6 feet tall, weighs about 200 pounds and has brown hair and eyes. The TBI believes Cummins to be armed with two handguns and driving a silver Nissan Rogue with Tennessee tag 976-ZPT. A warrant has been issued for Cummins for sexual contact with a minor and aggravated kidnapping. The TBI recently added him to the state’s ‘Top 10 Most Wanted’ list. There is a $1,000 reward for information leading to his capture. As of Friday morning, the TBI received more than 1,200 tips from across the country. The TBI urged the public to remain vigilant and report any information that may prove beneficial in the ongoing search to 1-800-TBI-FIND. If you spot the vehicle and can verify the license plate to be TN 976-ZPT, call 911 immediately. Recommended for You Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation on Thursday obtained surveillance images from a Wal-Mart on the Interstate 240 East Service Road. The images were captured the afternoon of March 15, TBI said. The images show Thomas shopping at the store with Cummins, who used cash to purchase various food items, TBI said in a news release. #TNAMBERAlert SIGHTING CONFIRMED: Tad Cummins and Elizabeth Thomas were in Oklahoma City on March 15th.

The two have been missing since March 13. Authorities have said Cummins, 50, lured and groomed Thomas, 15, before the kidnapping. Cummins was fired by the school system the day after the abduction, although as far back as January the two were caught kissing in his classroom.  Read more about how the school system handled the situation here. A former student of Cummins told Inside Edition in an interview that aired this week that the ex-teacher wrote a love song for her years ago. Although Destany Parrish says nothing inappropriate ever happened, the two were close when she was his student. Parrish shared audio footage with Inside Edition that she claims is Cummins singing the song to her at the school. Authorities are encouraging the public to share information about the Amber Alert with anyone they know south of the U.S. border. While investigators don't have any information placing Thomas and Cummins in Mexico, they say it's possible the two have made it that far. Mexican police have been notified about the case. The public is asked to remain vigilant, particularly in rural or secluded area. Hunters are asked to be on the lookout for Cummins and Thomas. Investigators are asking people to be vigilant in parking garages and lots, parks, campgrounds and other "off-the-grid" places. Thomas last was seen in Columbia, Tennessee when a friend dropped her off at Shoney's restaurant March 13. Cummins was seen filling up with gas at a nearby gas station. The bureau placed Cummins in Decatur, Alabama later that day. Thomas is a white female with strawberry or blonde hair and hazel eyes. She is 5 feet and weighs about 120 pounds. Cummins, believed to be armed with multiple guns, is a white male with brown hair and eyes. He is six feet and about 200 pounds. They may be traveling in a silver Nissan Rogue with Tennessee tag 976-ZPT. Anyone with information is asked to call 1-800-TBI-FIND. Anyone who sees Cummins, Thomas or the vehicle should call 911.

Walmart Battle Means Lower Prices For You; Headaches For Manufacturers Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Amazon Vs. Walmart Battle Means Lower Prices For You; Headaches For Manufacturers Image courtesy of REL Waldman March 31, 2017 12:35 pm EDT By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk how low can you go? this is war amazon prices walmart online shopping retail retailers consumer products Amazon can now deliver many things in one or two days, so Walmart has to have lower prices for the many customers who can wait. Similarly, Amazon has to undercut Walmart’s grocery prices if it’s going to stake out any significant portion of that $800 billion market. For shoppers at either of these two retail giants, this can mean lower prices, but it’s also forcing manufacturers and suppliers to rethink how they do business. Consumer brands have been increasingly dedicated to figuring out ways to deal with this pricing war, one executive told Re/code, noting that “it’s dominating the conversation every week.” Though Amazon made headlines this week for gathering some of the biggest packaged food brands together to pitch them on the idea of frustration-free packaging, as part of a push to attract more customers to online shopping instead of buying in physical stores, Walmart has also been meeting with its suppliers in an effort to ramp up the battle for shoppers. Last week, Walmart brought together major household brands at its headquarters for a pricing powwow. According to a presentation Re/code viewed, Walmart wants to have the lowest price on 80% of its sales, which means brands that sell through the retailer would have to cut costs elsewhere. Some vendors say doing this will mean they’ll lose money on every sale — but if they don’t cooperate, they could find their distribution limited in comparison to those who do play along. Walmart could also develop new in-house brands and sell those products to consumers instead of using outside suppliers. “Once every three or four years, Walmart tells you to take the money you’re spending on [marketing] initiatives and invest it in lower prices,” Jason Goldberg, head of SapientRazorfish, a digital agency that works with large brands and retailers, told Re/code. “They sweep all the chips off the table and drill you down on price.” Amazon may not yet be the grocery powerhouse that Walmart is, but it still has significant leverage to push suppliers to keep their prices low. The online retailer is not only willing to lose money on certain products just to beat the competition on price, notes Re/code, but isn’t afraid of dumping brands or products when vendors don’t play along. Re/code gives the example of Pampers diapers disappearing from Amazon last week, prompting speculation in the industry that the e-commerce giant booted Pampers in an effort to negotiate better prices.

This is SpaceX’s entire MO, the whole idea behind their business strategy. CEO Elon Musk has believed for years that by reusing and recycling tech and parts, we can bring the cost of space flight down dramatically. What SpaceX is doing could dramatically improve access to launch equipment, since the company is trying to operate like an airline — charging customers for the service of delivering something to space. Right now, a launch costs about $62 million from the customer. Most of that goes to the actual cost of constructing the 230-foot tall Falcon 9. But, if you can recycle major pieces of the mission, then that’s time and money that can go somewhere else.

Quotes in the article Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 886.54 +10.20 +1.16% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 72.08 +0.49 +0.68% Costco Wholesale Corp COST ▼ 167.69 -0.20 -0.12% Unilever PLC UL ▼ 49.34 -0.29 -0.58% Last month, Walmart gathered some of America’s biggest household brands near its Arkansas headquarters for a tough talk. For years, Walmart had dominated the retail landscape on the back of its “Everyday Low Price” guarantee. But now, Walmart was too often getting beaten on price. So company executives were there, in part, to reset expectations with Walmart’s suppliers — the consumer brands whose chips, sodas and diapers line the shelves of its Supercenters and its website. Walmart wants to have the lowest price on 80 percent of its sales, according to a presentation the company made at the summit, which Recode reviewed. To accomplish that, the brands that sell their goods through Walmart would have to cut their wholesale prices or make other cost adjustments to shave at least 15 percent off. In some cases, vendors say they would lose money on each sale if they met Walmart’s demands. Brands that agree to play ball with Walmart could expect better distribution and more strategic help from the giant retailer. And to those that didn’t? Walmart said it would limit their distribution and create its own branded products to directly challenge its own suppliers. “Once every three or four years, Walmart tells you to take the money you’re spending on [marketing] initiatives and invest it in lower prices,” said Jason Goldberg, the head of the commerce practice at Sapient Razorfish, a digital agency that works with large brands and retailers. “They sweep all the chips off the table and drill you down on price.” But this time around, Walmart’s renewed focus on its “Everyday Low Price” promise coincides with Amazon’s increased aggressiveness in its own pricing of the packaged goods that are found on supermarket shelves and are core to Walmart’s success, industry executives and consultants say. The result in recent months has been a high-stakes race to the bottom between Walmart and Amazon that seems great for shoppers, but has consumer packaged goods brands feeling the pressure. The pricing crackdown also comes in the wake of Walmart’s $3 billion acquisition of Jet.com and its CEO Marc Lore. Lore now runs Walmart.com and has said one of his mandates is to create new ways for the retailer to beat everyone else on price, including Amazon. The pricing pressure has ignited intense wargaming inside the largest CPG companies, according to people familiar with discussions at Procter & Gamble, Unilever, PepsiCo, Mondelez and Kimberly-Clark. There is no one-size-fits-all solution. “It’s dominating the conversation every week,” said an executive at one of these companies. Representatives for these companies either declined to comment or failed to respond to requests for comment. Executives inside these companies would only speak on a condition of anonymity because negotiations with retailers are confidential. An Amazon spokesperson said in an email: “At Amazon we protect low prices for our customers, every single day — nothing has changed in terms of our focus or how we operate.” Walmart did not provide a comment. Amazon algorithm One piece of the battle, executives say, is an Amazon algorithm that works to match or beat prices from other websites and stores. Former Amazon employees say it finds the lowest price per unit or per ounce for a given product — even if it’s in a huge bulk-size pack at Costco — and applies it across the same type of good on Amazon, even when the pack size is much smaller. So let’s imagine Costco is selling a pack of 10 bags of Doritos for $10 — or $1 per bag. Amazon’s algorithm notes that one bag is $1 at Costco and, in turn, lowers the price on Amazon of a single bag of Doritos to $1. That is a great deal for customers — something that is likely driving the decision at Amazon, where an obsession with customer value dominates its strategy. But now, Amazon is selling individual items at Costco prices while not getting the same wholesale price that Costco enjoys. In short, it’s going to be really hard for Amazon to turn a profit on those goods. When Walmart sees this, it freaks out on the supplier, industry executives say. And it doesn’t matter to Walmart that Amazon may not be getting the same wholesale price that retailers like Costco or other membership clubs receive. In other words, even if Amazon isn’t profiting from its extremely low prices, Walmart is still demanding the same bulk-rate discount applied to individual items. “Walmart has had it explained to them by myself and others,” said one industry insider who asked for anonymity talking about private discussions. “My conclusion has been that they beat all suppliers up regardless because they need it to be a problem at the senior levels of these companies.” In some instances, Amazon is willing to lose money for some period of time on a product it feels it has to have. Jeff Bezos’ company knows, after all, that it has to continue to increase its selection in non-perishable grocery goods if it is going to really challenge Walmart in the $800 billion category. But, more so than in the past, Amazon is ratcheting up the pressure on manufacturers of goods that the online retailer is unable to sell for a profit, executives say. Separate from the algorithm, brands are also facing the realization that their products that are sold profitably in stores may become unprofitable online when shipping costs are factored in. Unprofitable items are known inside Amazon as CRaP products — the acronym stands for “Can’t Realize a Profit.” And Amazon is not afraid to kick off big and small brands alike. Case in point: On a Friday afternoon last month, all Pampers diapers sold by Amazon were unavailable on the site. Industry speculation was that Amazon may have kicked Pampers off the site as part of a negotiation over prices. Neither Amazon nor Pampers parent company Procter & Gamble would comment on whether this was the case. But the bigger point may be that senior industry executives thought such a move was even a legitimate possibility. “I’m very concerned,” one of them said. “Do all CPG goods get commoditized to 40 percent below where they’re used to being? The long-term implication is you just don’t know where the bottom is.” When Amazon warns suppliers that a product is pre-Cr*P meaning it’s in jeopardy of being kicked off the site for profitability issues, it makes demands. Oftentimes, to lower wholesale prices. But that doesn’t always work, especially if a brand has the leverage of also selling into Walmart, which is still the biggest retail customer for many manufacturers. In these instances, Amazon may transfer the product to Amazon Pantry, a smaller catalogue of goods restricted to Prime Members. All Pantry orders come with a $5.99 shipping fee per box, which helps cover Amazon’s costs, if fewer than five items are ordered at one time. Another Amazon tactic is to prohibit some brands from buying ads within the site for a product that Amazon can’t make profitable on a standalone basis. Like paying for prominent placement in a store, a brand can buy ads within Amazon to promote their products. Blocking these ads is another way of burying a product. “They are playing Jekyll and Hyde,” said an executive at a large grocery goods manufacturer. “At times, it’s all about growth; at times, it’s all about profitability. They keep switching back and forth.” Another factor: As Amazon Prime becomes a bigger part of Amazon’s business, Amazon ships more orders that consist of just one item. These orders can typically be tougher to make profitable than multi-item orders — a trend that could explain the renewed focus on profitability.  “Amazon realizes Walmart is serious,” the executive said, “and is basically asking manufacturers to subsidize their unprofitable shipping costs for them.” No easy solution What is a brand to do? There is no one-size-fits-all solution. Some do give in and offer Amazon a better price if they can afford it. Some push Amazon to keep the unprofitable product, but give them a better deal on a more profitable item. Another strategy is to stop selling to Amazon as a wholesaler and instead sell directly, or through resellers, on Amazon’s marketplace. Amazon cannot control the price of an item sold by marketplace sellers, though it can make it harder to find items that aren’t priced aggressively. The longest-term solution, however, is perhaps the most difficult: Reimagining how a product should be designed and packaged from the ground up, specifically for e-commerce sales. That often means cutting the weight of low-price goods since shipping costs tend to eat into a product’s profitability. (Amazon, in fact, is trying to capitalize on this potential shift by asking brands to reformulate their packaging to make it easier to ship — all done via Amazon, of course.) Big brands, however, have been doing more talk than action when it comes to pursuing this solution — a fact that you can be sure Amazon has noticed. But Andrea Leigh, an ex-Amazon manager who now runs her own brand consultancy, has come across a few examples of brands redesigning goods for e-commerce. One of them, from the brand Celsius, is an energy drink that has been transformed into powdered packets that the customer mixes with water at home. Then there’s the brand Green Works, which has sold household cleaners in concentrate form, along with an empty spray container. “If competitors go away and you can live it out, it presents you with an opportunity where you can steal share in a relatively easy way,” she said. “Figuring out how to do online better and not getting CRaP-ed out, that’s a huge opportunity.” The rise of direct to consumers? Perhaps the toughest part of being a traditional consumer packaged goods brand today is that you don’t know who your customer is because you sell to them via a middleman: Retailers like Amazon and Walmart. And if you try to sell direct through your own website — which requires a different set of skills — retailers often raise hell. Yes, the same retail partners that are putting the squeeze on wholesale prices. So some of these multinational companies are dabbling with diversifying their sales channels through acquisition. Unilever, the owner of brands like Dove and Hellmann's, last year purchased the subscription razor startup Dollar Shave Club for $1 billion. The vast majority of Dollar Shave Club’s sales come through its own website. Venture capitalists are betting that that deal will be the first of many acquisitions of digital-first brands that would traditionally sell their goods on supermarket shelves — though no major ones have yet followed. If they’re right long-term, however, this pricing pressure from Amazon and Walmart may be partly to blame — or thank.

This Sept. 6, 2012, file photo, shows the Amazon logo in Santa Monica, Calif. Amazon is continuing to delve into new ways of letting people shop. (Reed Saxon / Associated Press) By Spencer Soper and Craig Giammona Bloomberg Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS SEATTLE – Amazon.com’s market value has climbed $23 billion this week in the wake of positive analyst reports that point to continued growth for the world’s dominant online retailer. Amazon shares closed up 1.2 percent at a record $886.54 Friday, and were up 5.8 percent from Monday’s opening price. Amazon, the fourth-largest publicly traded company, is now worth about $423 billion. The stock surge has bumped CEO Jeff Bezos, the biggest shareholder in the company, to No. 2 among the world’s richest people, right after Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Amazon has invited some of the world’s biggest brands to its Seattle headquarters in an audacious bid to persuade them that it’s time to start shipping products directly to online shoppers and bypass chains like Wal-Mart, Target and Costco. Executives from General Mills, Mondelez and other packaged goods makers will attend the three-day gathering in May, Bloomberg has learned. Attendees will tour an Amazon fulfillment center and hear a presentation from Worldwide Consumer chief Jeff Wilke, who reports directly to Jeff Bezos. Amazon is looking to upend relationships between brands and brick-and-mortar stores that for decades have determined how popular products are designed, packaged and shipped. If Amazon succeeds, big brands will think less about creating products that stand out in a Wal-Mart Stores aisle. Instead, they’ll focus on designing products that can be shipped quickly to customers’ doorsteps. Brands have been experimenting with such changes, so the Seattle event may well resonate. “Times are changing,” Amazon says in an invitation obtained by Bloomberg. “Amazon strongly believes that supply chains designed to serve the direct-to-consumer business have the power to bring improved customer experiences and global efficiency. To achieve this requires a major shift in thinking.” Manufacturers would have to re-imagine everything from the way products are made to how they’re packaged. Laundry detergent could come in sturdier, leak-proof containers. Instead of flimsy packages designed to pop on store shelves, cookies, crackers and cereal could be packed in durable, unadorned boxes. Plants could spit out products for individuals rather than trucks full of inventory. It’s unclear who would handle the shipping, though Amazon offers a range of fulfillment services. The company declined to comment. Amazon has been struggling to crack the food and packaged goods market – an $800 billion category still dominated by Wal-Mart and other traditional chains. Persuading brands to design their packaging and operations for the online world would make it easier for Amazon to ship common household goods to urban dwellers in less than an hour, potentially making last-minute dashes to the store obsolete. Amazon must convince brands that even though online purchases represent a small part of their sales, e-commerce is the future. “Most of these people haven’t been interested in e-commerce because e-commerce has been such a small piece of their overall sales,” said Melissa Burdick, vice president of e-commerce at the Mars Agency marketing firm. “But we’ve reached a tipping point. We’re at a time when companies are ready to start figuring this stuff out.” Amazon is looking to influence product makers the same way Costco and other club stores convinced brands more than 20 years ago to create bulk sizes sold at a discount. “There was a big perceived penalty for missing the boat, fear of missing out on growth,” said Jim Hertel, senior vice president at the marketing firm Inmar. Just like Costco, he said, Amazon will encourage the changes by promising increased sales, a possibly welcome pitch for companies struggling to rekindle sales growth amid rapidly changing consumer tastes and shopping habits. Amazon has already forced some manufacturers to revolutionize their packaging. For years toy and electronics makers have packaged their wares to help prevent theft and to maximize store display. But the packages’ tough plastic was hard to open, turning off millions of consumers. Amazon pushed manufacturers to develop packages that pop open more easily. Today thousands of “frustration-free” products are sold on its site. Some brands will be easier to persuade than others. One could be Nike, which has an Amazon store and has been experimenting with selling directly to consumers. Nike COO Eric Sprunk is scheduled to speak at Amazon’s Seattle gathering. The event’s co-host is SCM World, a research and conference group that serves the supply-chain industry. SCM’s advisory board includes executives from Unilever, Kimberly-Clark and Land O’ Lakes butter. Amazon’s pitch comes as brick-and-mortar competitors try to blunt its momentum by enhancing their own online shopping options. Wal-Mart and other big-box retailers are experimenting with things like buy online, pick up in store. Startups like Instacart and Deliv make deliveries from stores to homes, helping retailers keep up with Amazon. Looking to match the quick delivery benefits of Amazon Prime membership, Wal-Mart offers a free two-day delivery on orders of $35 or more. Wal-Mart and Amazon squared off last week in Las Vegas with keynote speeches at the ShopTalk conference that drew more than 5,000 attendees, including executives with major brands. Marc Lore, who heads Wal-Mart’s e-commerce initiatives, touted the price leverage of the world’s biggest retailer that buys products by the truckload. Peter Faricy, who runs Amazon’s marketplace, said the online retailer would continue to narrow shipping times and talked up a future when one-hour delivery is the standard. Despite the long relationships between brands and traditional stores, Amazon has leverage to convince manufacturers to rethink their operations, said Ken Cassar, an analyst at Slice Intelligence. He notes that Amazon has 300 million shoppers and can make its own products if brands aren’t willing to sell on its marketplace. “Fear, more than anything else,” Cassar said, “may compel these companies to pay attention.” Updated: March 31, 2017, 8:35 p.m.  Tags: Amazon, business, Cheerios, Oreos, retail, Wal-Mart Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Print edition home delivery Newspaper Routes Available Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Masthead Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

"Following" : "Follow"}} March 31, 2017 10:40am   Comments Share: Related AMZN Amazon Gets New Buy Rating, $1,100 Price Target At Loop Capital How Companies Compartmentalize Global Regulators' Conflicting Demands Stocks Open Lower; FMC Spikes, Amazon Up On Buy Rating (Investor's Business Daily) Related WMT Should Wal-Mart Investors Be Concerned That Amazon Invited Food Execs To Its Seattle Office? The Market In 5 Minutes Lululemon Joins Ranks of Poorly Performing Athletic Giants (GuruFocus) Reports surfaced this week that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) is trying win over executives from packaged food companies to sell their products directly to customers instead of going through a retail middle-man, like Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE: WMT). As Amazon is looking to grow its food business, Wal-Mart and other retailers could be forced to take action to maintain its share, including lowering their price. But according to a Recode report, a looming price war between Amazon and Wal-Mart isn't good news for major brands. In fact, Recode reported that Wal-Mart held a presentation with food executives last month for a "tough talk." Specifically, Wal-Mart has an objective of offering the lowest price on 80 percent of its sales but to reach this goal brands that sell through Wal-Mart may need to slash their wholesale price or find other ways to offer Wal-Mart a 15 percent rebate. Recode noted that some brands may see their transactions lose money if it were to comply with Wal-Mart's objectives. Wal-Mart Is Playing Hardball Brands that agree to Wal-Mart's terms will see improved distribution and other benefits, but those that say no to the retailer behemoth face the threat of competing against Wal-Mart's own branded products. And this is where Amazon comes in. The online retailer uses algorithms that match or beat prices from other websites and stores. In fact, Amazon is even willing to lose money on transactions and Wal-Mart knows this. "When Walmart sees this, it freaks out on the supplier, industry executives say," the Recode report explained. "And it doesn't matter to Walmart that Amazon may not be getting the same wholesale price that retailers like Costco or other membership clubs receive. In other words, even if Amazon isn't profiting from its extremely low prices, Walmart is still demanding the same bulk-rate discount applied to individual items."

(WDRB) -- Police have arrested two people after after an elderly woman was robbed at knifepoint in the parking lot of a Walmart in south Louisville.  According to the arrest warrant, it happened Feb. 19 at the Walmart Supercenter in the 7100 block of Cedar Springs Blvd. near the Gene Snyder Freeway and Bardstown Road. Police say 24-year-old Tracey Dixon and 21-year-old Krystal Hess were circling the parking lot in a red Mustang when they spotted an 82-year-old woman loading groceries into her vehicle that was parked in a handicapped spot near the entrance of the store.  Police say Dixon stopped the Mustang next to the victim's vehicle, and Hess got out of the car with a knife. According to the warrant, Hess pressed the knife against the victim's side and told her she would use it if the victim didn't hand over her purse. Police say Hess then grabbed the purse, dropped the knife and took off in the Mustang.  The knife was recovered and kept for evidence. The victim's purse was found on Smyrna Road, but it was empty.  Witnesses were able to get the license plate number of the Mustang, and people who knew Hess were able to identify her from the store's security video. Police caught up with Hess not long after the incident. They say she admitted during questioning that Dixon chose the victim and told her to rob her "and not to worry because (she) wouldn't get in trouble."  Hess is charged with giving police a false name or address and first degree robbery. She's being held at Louisville Metro Corrections on a $10,000 cash bond.  Dixon was arrested March 30 and charged with first degree robbery. His bond was set at $25,000.  Copyright 2017 WDRB Media.

Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Mar 31, 2017 at 9:35AM After years of struggling to translate its brick-and-mortar success to the digital world, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) spent $3.3 billion last year to acquire e-commerce start-up Jet.com as well as the services of its founder and CEO, Marc Lore, a serial e-commerce entrepreneur who founded Quidsi, the Diapers.com parent Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) paid $545 million for six years ago. Lore was immediately put in charge of Walmart.com, which he is running along with Jet.com. It was a bold move by the retailer, a sort of self-disruption designed to inject start-up thinking into a mature brand. Lore acted quickly and decisively to counteract Amazon's major lead. His biggest move was to eliminate Wal-Mart's $50-a-year answer to Amazon Prime, ShippingPass. Instead of charging customers an annual fee for free two-day shipping -- something Prime members pay $99 a year for -- Wal-Mart's new digital boss made two-day shipping free with any qualifying order over $35. That was a short-term profits-be-damned move that a start-up would make when taking on a giant. It was a direct shot at Amazon, an attempt to woo both uncommitted customers and the estimated 65 million Prime members in the United States, who are estimated to spend an average of $1,200 a year on Amazon.com. It's easy to see why Wal-Mart wants to win over Prime members, but after a month of giving Walmart.com a chance, I'm pretty sure it's not going to work. Wal-Mart has made some bold moves to grow its online business. Image source: Wal-Mart. A month with Walmart.com I have been a Prime member for many years, close to as long as the program has been offered. I don't order from Amazon every day, but certainly a few times a week, and sometimes more than once in a single day if a need pops up. I started buying physical books and CDs from the retailer, and now buy everything from electronics to food, kitty litter, tea, various household supplies, and much more. It's important to point out that Amazon does not share data on how often Prime members order, but the company has made it very easy to place single-item orders that total less than $35. You can, for example, reorder your dish-washing liquid using an internet-connected Dash button that you can place near your sink. You can also order through the Alexa voice assistant and place single-click orders on your phone, or through a computer. It's a system that encourages buying what you need when you need it and that's where my experiment using WalMart.com hit some major snags. My first order of the month was an attempt to find a jar of smooth spaghetti sauce, as my 13-year-old son does not like tomato chunks in his sauce. Wal-Mart stocked the brand I wanted, but the item was under $10, so I placed the order on Amazon. That pattern repeated throughout the month. I needed earbuds, sticky notes, a tote bag for the beach, and various other things, but never all at once, and never in a quantity that totaled $35. In most cases, I did find the item I wanted, or a comparable one, on WalMart.com. That actually surprised me because Amazon has "over 50 million eligible items," according to its web page while Wal-Mart's free two-day shipping offer only covers "more than two million items," the company said in a press release. Still, a good selection did not matter when hitting the $35 threshold would have required planning, waiting, or buying things I don't need. Prime is still the king Amazon has trained me, and I would assume tens of millions of other Prime members, that we can have pretty much whatever we want in two days no matter how small the order is. Having to attempt to hold off on ordering, or pad my order to get to $35 was a complication that for me makes the $99 Prime cost worth it. There's nothing wrong with Wal-Mart's website or app. Both rival Amazon for ease-of use. The one order I did place with the company, which I padded with a video game to reach the $35 threshold, came in two days as promised (albeit in three separate boxes) and was no more difficult to place than a Prime order.  Offering free two-day shipping on orders over $35 compared to Amazon's Free 5-to-8-day shipping on orders over $25 will win Wal-Mart some customers. Those shoppers, however, will largely come from digital consumers not yet loyal to Amazon, people who only shop online occasionally, and cheapskates willing to put up with inconvenience to save a buck. It's not that Wal-Mart's deal is not attractive, it's simply that in my experience, getting to $35 in order to trigger the free shipping proved much harder than expected Consider this a first move from Lore who appears to have the full backing of Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon. Free shipping on orders over $35 should measurably move the needle for the company, just not at Amazon's expense. Daniel Kline has no position in any stocks mentioned.

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search Some Dividend Aristocrats Are Looking Mighty Weak These Days March 31, 2017 8:45am BATS:NOBL ShareTweet From Contrarian Outlook: The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats are a group of stocks beloved as “widows-and-orphans” investments – can’t-miss companies whose stability and rock-solid dividends will keep you into old age and will exist long after you’ve passed. It’s a reassuring thought, but ultimately, it’s an illusion. Like the broader S&P 500 and the stock market as a whole, some of its members are good investments, and some – including five losers I plan on highlighting today – are not. I love the term “dividend aristocrat” … but only because it’s more honest than most people realize. The word “aristocrat” can refer to people who are many things, including superior, better able, smarter and wiser. That’s fair. Many dividend aristocrats truly are among the best companies in the world, and the best stewards of your investment money. But there’s also a good reason we all cringe a little at the word “aristocracy.” Marie Antoinette lost her head because the aristocracy – “elite” as it might have been – wasn’t particularly good about addressing the needs of the people. That’s the problem with several dividend aristocrats. Consider this: Company A meets all the criteria for S&P 500 dividend aristocracy, including hiking its dividend 10%, maybe 15% every year – more income in your pocket, and a likely sign that the business is amply growing. Company B meets all the criteria for inclusion, including hiking its dividend 0.5%, maybe 1% every year – literally shortchanging you by not even keeping up with inflation, and a likely sign that the business has flatlined. Both companies would still be dividend aristocrats. Investors also tend to forget that dividend aristocracy isn’t eternal. Pitney Bowes (PBI) was dropped from the club in 2013 after the company halved its quarterly payout, from 37.5 cents to 18.75 cents. Let those investors eat cake. Membership today doesn’t guarantee dividends in perpetuity, and it certainly doesn’t guarantee a strong investment. So today, I want to highlight five widely held S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats that have hiked their dividends for decades … but ultimately will be dead money that holds your portfolio back because the stock market is all about future (rather than past) performance. Wal-Mart (WMT) Dividend Yield: 2.9% Big-box retailer Wal-Mart (WMT) has warned customers about falling prices for decades … but all the while gracing investors with rising dividends. In fact, back in February, WMT upped the ante on its payout to reach a 44th consecutive year of dividend increases. That’s the good news. The bad news? For one, that dividend hike was a mere 2%, from $2 per share annually to $2.04, or 51 cents quarterly. Worse, payout increases have hovered around 2% for the past four years, with WMT chipping in a mere penny per share extra annually since 2014. The world’s largest retailer is never going away – not as long as the middle class continues to shrink and there’s an abundance of consumers who need low-cost goods. But competition with Amazon (AMZN) online, Target (TGT) on the brick-and-mortar high ground and Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) on the brick-and-mortar low ground has strangled Walmart’s growth prospects. Avoid Walmart. Its middling yield won’t compensate for stagnant prices. Walmart’s (WMT) Dividend Growth Has Slowed to a Crawl McDonald’s (MCD) Dividend Yield: 2.9% Speaking of growth woes, let’s look at another popular low-cost name: McDonald’s (MCD). Yes, this is the same McDonald’s that’s trading at all-time highs right now. And to its credit, McDonald’s always seems to have some sort of “second act” that revives faith in the company, whether it’s fighting off health criticisms with wraps and salads, or emphasizing a strength by offering all-day breakfast. But the performance in MCD doesn’t reflect reality. Revenues peaked in 2013 and have declined every year since, including a $24.6 billion top line in 2016 that was 12% lower than it was three years ago. While net income rebounded a bit to $4.7 billion, that’s still 16% off 2013 levels. McDonald’s most recent dividend increase – in 2016, its 40th consecutive year – was more robust than Wal-Mart’s, but at 5.6%, it was hardly generous. Combine that with a mediocre yield, a forward P/E that’s more expensive than the market and revenues that are expected to decline by double digits this year and next, and I have to wonder: What’s the point? McDonald’s (MCD) Operations Are Stuck in Limbo Duke Energy (DUK) Dividend Yield: 4.1% At least with utilities, you know you’re not getting much in the way of growth. These plays are all about dividends and stability, and on those two fronts, Duke Energy (DUK) does a decent enough job of delivery. But that’s about the best thing I can say about Duke right now. For one, while many people believe a great coal renaissance is nigh, I disagree. Utility companies are ditching coal-fired plants left and right, replacing them with natural gas plants, which are cleaner but costlier. While President Donald Trump will try to revive coal, I think it’s past saving, and that puts a cap on DUK shares going forward. But more simply, DUK is too expensive and too chintzy. The stock trades at nearly 27 times earnings, which isn’t just high on its own – it’s high historically, too. And while the company celebrated its 90th consecutive dividend increase last July, that came in at a token 3.6% … nudging its five-year compound average dividend growth higher to just 2.7%. Duke Energy (DUK) Is Too Expensive for Low Growth, Low Dividend Growth Kimberly-Clark (KMB) Dividend Yield: 2.9% Kimberly-Clark (KMB) is one of several low-growth dividend aristocrats from the consumer staples sector that investors pile into for safety and reasonable yields. The rationale is fine: No matter how bad things get, people are still going to need Huggies diapers, Kleenex tissues and Cottonelle toilet paper – and that provides Kimberly-Clark with some natural defense during market downturns. So does KMB’s dividend increase streak of 45 consecutive years, which gives investors the warm fuzzies. Like McDonald’s, Kimberly-Clark is trading near all-time highs. And like MCD shareholders, KMB bulls seem to be ignoring a downtrend on the top line for the past few years, and the fact that Wall Street only sees marginal growth in the years ahead. Meanwhile, Kimberly-Clark’s dividend increases have slowed to 4%-5% over the past few years, and the stock’s P/E has ballooned back to above 20. Toilet paper and a 3% yield won’t be able to push KMB much farther from here. Kimberly-Clark (KMB) Will Face Reality at Some Point Coca-Cola (KO) Dividend Yield: 3.5% Last, we look at Coca-Cola (KO), which has improved its quarterly payout for 55 consecutive years. Simply put, Coca-Cola is in trouble. While the eponymous Coca-Cola brand is never going away completely, and while KO has diversified into other drink types, Americans (and increasingly, the rest of the world) are turning away from sugary drinks – and that’s dire news for Coke. In 2015, soda consumption suffered its 11th consecutive annual decline and fell to a 30-year low. While 2016 figures aren’t yet out, we do know that last year, American bottled water consumption surpassed carbonated soft drinks for the first time. Things don’t look to improve going forward, with cities increasingly grappling with the idea of soda taxes to boost government coffers. Coca-Cola is increasingly feeling the weight – revenues are mired in a multiyear slump, and shares trade essentially where they did four years ago. Meanwhile, dividend growth has slowed to less than 6% as of KO’s last payout hike. And yet somehow, shares still trade for nearly 22 times next year’s earnings! This dividend aristocrat isn’t dead by any means, but it’s certainly dead money. Coca-Cola (KO) Is Going the Wrong Way! The ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (BATS:NOBL) was unchanged in premarket trading Friday. Year-to-date, NOBL has gained 4.30%, versus a 5.71% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. NOBL currently has an ETF Daily News SMART Grade of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #14 of 107 ETFs in the Large Cap Blend ETFs category. The Retirement Portfolio You NEVER Have to Touch! One of the cruelest ironies I’ve come across is how many retirement portfolios hold these and other dividend aristocrats that will weigh down their nest eggs, but how few of them hold the types of big-yielding, dividend-growing dynamos that are found in my “No Withdrawal” retirement portfolio. Too many investors are suckered into buying big-name large-cap blue chips that boast safety on the promise of “big” yields … of 3%, maybe 4% if you’re lucky. But these stocks often start to rot in your portfolio with dividend increases that don’t even keep up with inflation, and tiny capital gains because they’ve given up on growth a long, long time ago. And remember, if you’re earnings just 3% to 4%, that means you’re bringing annual retirement income of just $30,000, maybe $40,000 a year. You and I both know how far you’ll get on that: Not far. Not far at all. That’s why I’ve buried my heads in the books to compile a “No Withdrawal” retirement portfolio – a set of buy-and-hold dividend stock picks that generate yields of 6%, 7%, 8% … even a couple in the double digits, but also offer 7% to 15% upside in annual capital gains. That means you can live off dividend income alone without ever touching your nest egg – but if disaster strikes and you need to dip in, that’s OK, because you’ve grown your retirement account with these double-whammy dynamos. What makes this portfolio so effective is that it’s an all-star makeup – rather than focusing on just one area of the market, it’s the best of the best preferred stocks, REITs, closed-end funds and more. That means diversification and continued payouts against the most volatile of markets. Don’t spend your retirement hoping you can just get by on meager blue-chip returns and your Social Security checks. Collect big, regular dividend checks instead that will let you pay the bills, finance your vacations and even spoil your family. This is the path to the worry-free retirement you deserve. Click here and I’ll provide you with THREE special reports that show you the path to building a “No Withdrawal” portfolio.

Several Walmart workers noticed the toddler "sleeping in a shopping cart in the game room" of the store, according to a police report. Walmart workers then called for the boy's parents over the intercom and also walked aisle to aisle asking if anyone was his mother. When they got no response, they called police. The child's 29-year-old mother, Ashley Spivey, of Anderson, was arrested in the course of the investigation. According to the police report, officers were in the store waiting for video footage and for a representative of the South Carolina Department of Social Services when they noticed a woman staring at them who seemed interested in what they were doing. "The female then saw us starting to walk toward her, and she started acting like she was going to walk away," the report noted. An officer caught up with Spivey, who told police she left her son with her boyfriend and did not know where he went. Investigators called her boyfriend to the store. He showed up in a work uniform, "dirty from working on cars," and told police Spivey, with her son in the car, had dropped him off at work. The boyfriend told investigators Spivey was supposed to bring him a biscuit, but never returned. The boyfriend told police that Spivey was "acting really weird" and told officers she had taken some muscle relaxers and "that might be why she is being abnormal." Police said they then talked to Spivey again and "her story kept changing and was not making much sense." Video footage from Walmart showed Spivey dropped her son off at Walmart's game center at 7:27 a.m., according to police. The same footage showed Spivey leaving the store at 8:04 a.m from the opposite side of where her son was left in a cart. "Somehow, she ended up back inside the store and walked out again at 08:38," the police report noted. The toddler is in the custody of the mother of Spivey's boyfriend. The boyfriend's mother passed a background check, according to police. In October, a Georgia woman left her then 9-week-old baby in a shopping cart inside the Publix on Clemson Boulevard in Anderson. Anderson County Sheriff's Office investigators said the mother in that case soon called 911 crying and screaming that she had left her baby at the grocery store. After reviewing video footage in that case, investigators determined the woman did not intentionally leave the baby. The woman was not charged, and her name was not disclosed by investigators.

This is SpaceX’s entire MO, the whole idea behind their business strategy. CEO Elon Musk has believed for years that by reusing and recycling tech and parts, we can bring the cost of space flight down dramatically. What SpaceX is doing could dramatically improve access to launch equipment, since the company is trying to operate like an airline — charging customers for the service of delivering something to space. Right now, a launch costs about $62 million from the customer. Most of that goes to the actual cost of constructing the 230-foot tall Falcon 9. But, if you can recycle major pieces of the mission, then that’s time and money that can go somewhere else.

Quotes in the article Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 886.54 +10.20 +1.16% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 72.08 +0.49 +0.68% Costco Wholesale Corp COST ▼ 167.69 -0.20 -0.12% Unilever PLC UL ▼ 49.34 -0.29 -0.58% Last month, Walmart gathered some of America’s biggest household brands near its Arkansas headquarters for a tough talk. For years, Walmart had dominated the retail landscape on the back of its “Everyday Low Price” guarantee. But now, Walmart was too often getting beaten on price. So company executives were there, in part, to reset expectations with Walmart’s suppliers — the consumer brands whose chips, sodas and diapers line the shelves of its Supercenters and its website. Walmart wants to have the lowest price on 80 percent of its sales, according to a presentation the company made at the summit, which Recode reviewed. To accomplish that, the brands that sell their goods through Walmart would have to cut their wholesale prices or make other cost adjustments to shave at least 15 percent off. In some cases, vendors say they would lose money on each sale if they met Walmart’s demands. Brands that agree to play ball with Walmart could expect better distribution and more strategic help from the giant retailer. And to those that didn’t? Walmart said it would limit their distribution and create its own branded products to directly challenge its own suppliers. “Once every three or four years, Walmart tells you to take the money you’re spending on [marketing] initiatives and invest it in lower prices,” said Jason Goldberg, the head of the commerce practice at Sapient Razorfish, a digital agency that works with large brands and retailers. “They sweep all the chips off the table and drill you down on price.” But this time around, Walmart’s renewed focus on its “Everyday Low Price” promise coincides with Amazon’s increased aggressiveness in its own pricing of the packaged goods that are found on supermarket shelves and are core to Walmart’s success, industry executives and consultants say. The result in recent months has been a high-stakes race to the bottom between Walmart and Amazon that seems great for shoppers, but has consumer packaged goods brands feeling the pressure. The pricing crackdown also comes in the wake of Walmart’s $3 billion acquisition of Jet.com and its CEO Marc Lore. Lore now runs Walmart.com and has said one of his mandates is to create new ways for the retailer to beat everyone else on price, including Amazon. The pricing pressure has ignited intense wargaming inside the largest CPG companies, according to people familiar with discussions at Procter & Gamble, Unilever, PepsiCo, Mondelez and Kimberly-Clark. There is no one-size-fits-all solution. “It’s dominating the conversation every week,” said an executive at one of these companies. Representatives for these companies either declined to comment or failed to respond to requests for comment. Executives inside these companies would only speak on a condition of anonymity because negotiations with retailers are confidential. An Amazon spokesperson said in an email: “At Amazon we protect low prices for our customers, every single day — nothing has changed in terms of our focus or how we operate.” Walmart did not provide a comment. Amazon algorithm One piece of the battle, executives say, is an Amazon algorithm that works to match or beat prices from other websites and stores. Former Amazon employees say it finds the lowest price per unit or per ounce for a given product — even if it’s in a huge bulk-size pack at Costco — and applies it across the same type of good on Amazon, even when the pack size is much smaller. So let’s imagine Costco is selling a pack of 10 bags of Doritos for $10 — or $1 per bag. Amazon’s algorithm notes that one bag is $1 at Costco and, in turn, lowers the price on Amazon of a single bag of Doritos to $1. That is a great deal for customers — something that is likely driving the decision at Amazon, where an obsession with customer value dominates its strategy. But now, Amazon is selling individual items at Costco prices while not getting the same wholesale price that Costco enjoys. In short, it’s going to be really hard for Amazon to turn a profit on those goods. When Walmart sees this, it freaks out on the supplier, industry executives say. And it doesn’t matter to Walmart that Amazon may not be getting the same wholesale price that retailers like Costco or other membership clubs receive. In other words, even if Amazon isn’t profiting from its extremely low prices, Walmart is still demanding the same bulk-rate discount applied to individual items. “Walmart has had it explained to them by myself and others,” said one industry insider who asked for anonymity talking about private discussions. “My conclusion has been that they beat all suppliers up regardless because they need it to be a problem at the senior levels of these companies.” In some instances, Amazon is willing to lose money for some period of time on a product it feels it has to have. Jeff Bezos’ company knows, after all, that it has to continue to increase its selection in non-perishable grocery goods if it is going to really challenge Walmart in the $800 billion category. But, more so than in the past, Amazon is ratcheting up the pressure on manufacturers of goods that the online retailer is unable to sell for a profit, executives say. Separate from the algorithm, brands are also facing the realization that their products that are sold profitably in stores may become unprofitable online when shipping costs are factored in. Unprofitable items are known inside Amazon as CRaP products — the acronym stands for “Can’t Realize a Profit.” And Amazon is not afraid to kick off big and small brands alike. Case in point: On a Friday afternoon last month, all Pampers diapers sold by Amazon were unavailable on the site. Industry speculation was that Amazon may have kicked Pampers off the site as part of a negotiation over prices. Neither Amazon nor Pampers parent company Procter & Gamble would comment on whether this was the case. But the bigger point may be that senior industry executives thought such a move was even a legitimate possibility. “I’m very concerned,” one of them said. “Do all CPG goods get commoditized to 40 percent below where they’re used to being? The long-term implication is you just don’t know where the bottom is.” When Amazon warns suppliers that a product is pre-Cr*P meaning it’s in jeopardy of being kicked off the site for profitability issues, it makes demands. Oftentimes, to lower wholesale prices. But that doesn’t always work, especially if a brand has the leverage of also selling into Walmart, which is still the biggest retail customer for many manufacturers. In these instances, Amazon may transfer the product to Amazon Pantry, a smaller catalogue of goods restricted to Prime Members. All Pantry orders come with a $5.99 shipping fee per box, which helps cover Amazon’s costs, if fewer than five items are ordered at one time. Another Amazon tactic is to prohibit some brands from buying ads within the site for a product that Amazon can’t make profitable on a standalone basis. Like paying for prominent placement in a store, a brand can buy ads within Amazon to promote their products. Blocking these ads is another way of burying a product. “They are playing Jekyll and Hyde,” said an executive at a large grocery goods manufacturer. “At times, it’s all about growth; at times, it’s all about profitability. They keep switching back and forth.” Another factor: As Amazon Prime becomes a bigger part of Amazon’s business, Amazon ships more orders that consist of just one item. These orders can typically be tougher to make profitable than multi-item orders — a trend that could explain the renewed focus on profitability.  “Amazon realizes Walmart is serious,” the executive said, “and is basically asking manufacturers to subsidize their unprofitable shipping costs for them.” No easy solution What is a brand to do? There is no one-size-fits-all solution. Some do give in and offer Amazon a better price if they can afford it. Some push Amazon to keep the unprofitable product, but give them a better deal on a more profitable item. Another strategy is to stop selling to Amazon as a wholesaler and instead sell directly, or through resellers, on Amazon’s marketplace. Amazon cannot control the price of an item sold by marketplace sellers, though it can make it harder to find items that aren’t priced aggressively. The longest-term solution, however, is perhaps the most difficult: Reimagining how a product should be designed and packaged from the ground up, specifically for e-commerce sales. That often means cutting the weight of low-price goods since shipping costs tend to eat into a product’s profitability. (Amazon, in fact, is trying to capitalize on this potential shift by asking brands to reformulate their packaging to make it easier to ship — all done via Amazon, of course.) Big brands, however, have been doing more talk than action when it comes to pursuing this solution — a fact that you can be sure Amazon has noticed. But Andrea Leigh, an ex-Amazon manager who now runs her own brand consultancy, has come across a few examples of brands redesigning goods for e-commerce. One of them, from the brand Celsius, is an energy drink that has been transformed into powdered packets that the customer mixes with water at home. Then there’s the brand Green Works, which has sold household cleaners in concentrate form, along with an empty spray container. “If competitors go away and you can live it out, it presents you with an opportunity where you can steal share in a relatively easy way,” she said. “Figuring out how to do online better and not getting CRaP-ed out, that’s a huge opportunity.” The rise of direct to consumers? Perhaps the toughest part of being a traditional consumer packaged goods brand today is that you don’t know who your customer is because you sell to them via a middleman: Retailers like Amazon and Walmart. And if you try to sell direct through your own website — which requires a different set of skills — retailers often raise hell. Yes, the same retail partners that are putting the squeeze on wholesale prices. So some of these multinational companies are dabbling with diversifying their sales channels through acquisition. Unilever, the owner of brands like Dove and Hellmann's, last year purchased the subscription razor startup Dollar Shave Club for $1 billion. The vast majority of Dollar Shave Club’s sales come through its own website. Venture capitalists are betting that that deal will be the first of many acquisitions of digital-first brands that would traditionally sell their goods on supermarket shelves — though no major ones have yet followed. If they’re right long-term, however, this pricing pressure from Amazon and Walmart may be partly to blame — or thank.

Like the Wal-Mart founder, he’s a self-made billionaire from humble beginnings with a successful formula for retailing. By: Bloomberg | Published: March 31, 2017 4:12 PM The reason has much to do with Damani’s strategy of offering knockdown prices on everything from lentils to laundry powder in multistory hypermarkets on India’s urban fringes. (PTI) Radhakishan Damani may be India’s Sam Walton. Like the Wal-Mart founder, he’s a self-made billionaire from humble beginnings with a successful formula for retailing. So successful that when Damani’s 15-year-old company, Avenue Supermarts Ltd., went public last week, the stock price more than doubled on the first day of trading in Mumbai, valuing his direct family’s interest at about $3.6 billion. The reason has much to do with Damani’s strategy of offering knockdown prices on everything from lentils to laundry powder in multistory hypermarkets on India’s urban fringes. By appealing to homemakers with cheap, reliable staples and giving them ample parking in convenient locations, Damani has not only successfully countered the threat from online retailers, but beat them on earnings. Amazon.com Inc., the global giant that’s investing $5 billion in the Indian market, and Flipkart Online Services Pvt., the biggest domestic e-commerce company, are yet to make money in India, whereas Avenue Supermarts said it had net profit after tax of 3.2 billion rupees ($49.3 million) in the year ended March 2016. “The low-cost ethos that was embedded into the Wal-Mart chain by Sam Walton has become the hallmark of Damani, who’s ingrained it into his Avenue Supermarts,” said Arvind Singhal, chairman of retail consultancy Technopak Advisors Pvt., which tracks retail trends in India. “Like Wal-Mart, Damani has stuck to a single format and peddled a significant proportion of private-label goods from the very beginning.” Stag Profit Avenue Supermarts’ shares jumped as high as 650 rupees before closing at 641.6 rupees on their March 21 debut, compared with an initial public offering price of 299 rupees. The share sale raised 18.7 billion rupees, attracted bids for 106 times the quantity available, and was the best IPO performance in India in four years. The shares closed at 631.85 rupees in Mumbai Thursday, valuing the company at 394 billion rupees ($6 billion). Watch this also: For 61-year-old Damani, a former stockbroker who was raised in a one-room apartment in a Mumbai tenement block, the listing catapulted Damani’s wealth beyond that of Ajay Piramal, Anil Ambani and Kapil Bhatia, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Damani and his direct family have financial interests in Avenue Supermarts amounting to about 60 percent of the company. Soft-spoken with a preference for white clothing, Damani eschews media attention. He earned hundreds of millions of dollars from successful stock market investments that he used to kick-start a bricks-and-mortar retailing business just when many merchandisers were focusing on e-commerce. Damani wasn’t available for an interview, an external spokesperson for the company said. Urban Sprawl The retail chain, with its 129 D-Mart stores in more than 40 cities, is now more valuable than local rivals Future Retail, Aditya Birla Fashion and Trent Ltd. combined. Stores typically cater to bargain shoppers in the heartlands of India’s urban sprawl. Importantly, the land is acquired before real estate prices in the area have surged, said Arun Kejriwal, director at KRIS, an investment advisory firm. “We observe our customers and plan for them,” said Neville Noronha, managing director and chief executive officer at Avenue Supermarts, adding that D-Mart’s business model has evolved since its first store opened in 2002. It centers largely on everyday low prices — a concept reminiscent of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company started by Sam Walton in 1962. Avenue’s approach is also to procure merchandise at low prices and to avoid relying on sporadic promotions on specific products, the Mumbai-based company said in a regulatory filing in September. ‘Unfancy Stores’ “D-Mart has unfancy stores,” said Technopak’s Singhal. “If other retailers became counter-intuitive and chased retail glamour by opening stores in malls, launching multiple formats and going national, D-Mart has been intuitive by sticking to the very basics.” It doesn’t hire high-profile executives, pay “stratospheric” salaries or overspend on marketing and advertising — all of which are hallmarks of Indian retailers, Singhal said. “It’s not like Damani has stumbled on some magic formula — he hasn’t,” Singhal said. “These should have been the basic rules for every retail business in India.” D-Mart outlets follow a simple design: wide aisles on white-tiled floors under fluorescent tube lights. Elevators move shoppers and their trolleys between levels, with groceries and food staples located below household goods and sports equipment, and textiles and soft furnishings on the floor above. No Time to Clean “D-Mart offers me the best prices, and the grains are very clean — which is a big advantage over other retail stores in the vicinity,” said Varsha Nilesh Benke, a 35-year-old office worker, while on a twice-monthly weekend shop at the Seawoods store, 35 kilometers (22 miles) from downtown Mumbai. “Since I’m a working woman, I don’t have time to clean grains.” You may also like to watch this: Benke said she’s happy to purchase apparel online, but prefers to see for herself the rice and pulses she needs before buying. “D-Mart also offers free gift-wrapping services, which makes it convenient to buy a gift here,” Benke added. Retiree V.P. Sharma, who lives in Navi Mumbai, a satellite town east of the city, also says D-Mart has a distinct advantage over online retailers. “They show something on the net and deliver something else,” he said, while shopping at the same store. “Also, the delivery at odd hours, making e-commerce very inconvenient.” India hasn’t yet reached its retail renaissance, Boston Consulting Group said in a March 21 report, in which it predicted the South Asian nation will become the world’s third-largest consumer market by 2025. Domestic consumption will triple to $4 trillion by the middle of the next decade as rising affluence drives consumer behavior and spending, including in nascent agglomerations like the ones D-Mart is focusing on. “Damani may not have the size and scale of Wal-Mart, but certainly Damani is Sam Walton in the making,” said Kejriwal at KRIS.

The victim told officers that a white female with blonde hair got out of a gray or dark blue Nissan that was parked next to her vehicle. The suspect opened the victim’s car door, reached in and grabbed her by the hair. After a brief struggle, the suspect got back into the Nissan and fled the scene. Police say a white man with dark hair was in the Nissan at the time of the attack, but never got out of the vehicle. The vehicle has what appeared to be Kansas tags with the numbers 959. A spokesperson for the Junction City Police Department says there is no indication the attack had anything to do with human trafficking or that the public is in any immediate danger.

They're all fleeing YouTube. Internet by Claire Reilly March 30, 2017 11:42 PM PDT @reillystyley YouTube is under fire once more. Joan E. Solsman/CNET Don't expect your next viral video of a boxing kangaroo to be sponsored by the Australian Government -- at least not on YouTube. The Australian Government has announced it's suspending "all non-corporate campaign advertising" from YouTube. That includes everything from public messages from the Department of Health to Defence Force recruiting ads (though not ads for Government owned corporations like Australia Post). The decision is another blow to Google's video platform, which has seen advertisers exit in droves over concerns their ads could appear alongside inappropriate or extremist content. The exodus has seen major US brands like Wal-Mart, PepsiCo and AT&T pull advertising material, as well as UK names such as the The Guardian. Related stories Wal-Mart, PepsiCo and Dish pull YouTube ads over hateful videos YouTube apologizes for blocking LGBT videos YouTube CEO: Social media has 'responsibility' to greater good Australia's move follows a similar decision by the British Government, which reportedly had its ads served up next to videos featuring former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. Speaking about the decision to suspend advertising, Australian Special Minister of State Senator Scott Ryan said it would prevent taxpayer funds "inadvertently flowing to unsavoury organisations" through YouTube. "The Australian Government... will continue to request updates from Google on the steps being taken to mitigate risks," he said. Google says that it's doing an "extensive review" of its advertising policies and hopes to "give brands more control over where their ads appear," a spokesperson said in a statement.

For years, Walmart had dominated the retail landscape on the back of its "Everyday Low Price" guarantee. Walmart wants to have the lowest price on 80 percent of its sales, according to a presentation the company made at the summit, which Recode reviewed. To accomplish that, the brands that sell their goods through Walmart would have to cut their wholesale prices or make other cost adjustments to shave at least 15 percent off. In some cases, vendors say they would lose money on each sale if they met Walmart's demands. Brands that agree to play ball with Walmart could expect better distribution and more strategic help from the giant retailer. And to those that didn't? Walmart said it would limit their distribution and create its own branded products to directly challenge its own suppliers. But this time around, Walmart's renewed focus on its "Everyday Low Price" promise coincides with Amazon's increased aggressiveness in its own pricing of the packaged goods that are found on supermarket shelves and are core to Walmart's success, industry executives and consultants say. The result in recent months has been a high-stakes race to the bottom between Walmart and Amazon that seems great for shoppers, but has consumer packaged goods brands feeling the pressure. amazon business internet ← You may like to read: → House Approves Bill To Force Public Release of EPA Science Donald Trump Wins US Presidency Garmin Engineer Shot And Killed By Man Yelling 'Get Out Of My Country!'

Because Amazon is destroying brick-and-mortar retail across America, which in turn is doing a bad number on both suburban malls and town centers. During a boom when nearly everybody has a good job, there's plenty of business for both online and brick-and-mortar retailers. But when times are hard, people are counting dollars and Amazon wins that game. Not because they're always cheaper, but because they're cheaper in tactical ways - for example, they drove Tower Records, HMV, and Virgin Records out of business by discounting most pop music titles by 35 percent, only to jack prices back up to near-list after their competitors went out of business. Amazon is ruthless. They're not the consumers' friend, and they're certainly not the workers' friend. But they are very good.

Their rock-bottom pricing gospel has always attracted people who can't afford to pay anything more than that. Of course this includes many decent people of modest means and quite a few thoroughly unpleasant people. It used to work out well enough when the stores were reasonably staffed and they could keep things in check, but now it seems most of them are being run by a skeleton crew and the damages of the resulting circus are being considered just a cost of doing business. With Amazon, you never have to see these people and suffer the misery of queuing for 15 minutes just to check out. With Walmart, the experience is horrible. So if I'm looking to cheap-out on regular supplies, you can bet I'm going with Amazon. That's why I think they will win out in the end.

This is not irrational and those that have a need can usually do otherwise. For example, Harbor Freight tools are generally crap. But they are cheap. Professionals who use them ten hours a day, six days a week are not going to buy them unless they work in an environment where the tools "disappear" after a couple months (both because they fail more often and because they, generally, are not as easy to do quality work with quickly) -- these professionals buy professional tools. The rest of us are well served by buying a $19.99 "sawzall". If it ends up that we wear it out in five years or less than ten hours of "run-time", we will buy another OR a better brand -- but, in reality, most of these tools end up working for the rest of your life (at least as a backup to the better one you bought because you decided you wanted the cool features or smooth operation of the better one). Sometimes, the best tool from 40 years ago is inferior to the Harbor Freight tool (due to technology advances) and it is better to just buy new tools incorporating recent technology every ten years than using "great" tools that are thirty years old but can't hold a candle to the cheap tools available now. If you build a new server/desktop, do you buy the "highest quality" bits? If you're wealthy, doing so makes sense for bragging rights. However, for most engineers who are going to toss it in three to four years, it really doesn't matter if the case is plastic or thick steel or flimsy steel -- the resale value of the case is essentially zero and all three types of cases work fine if you don't have a full grown pet gorilla in your household who likes to play "toss the computer against the wall" (in which case, the quality of the case is likely the least of your worries as the gorilla grows up). Most of the durable goods bought at Walmart (tools, kitchen utensils, small kitchen appliances etc) probably end up being used a few times over the owner's lifetime. If they are going to bake all day, every day, they will buy a professional mixer instead of the deprecated KitchenAid crap that Target or Kohls or Walmart sells. Generally, why pay for "quality" -- do you really care if the kitchen gadget still works when your great grandchild inherits it and it's completely technologically obsolete anyway? Engineers should understand "cost:benefit" tradeoffs very well. I've got a very cool looking meat grinder that got passed down from my grandparents that still works as it did when my grandmother used it. Guess what, I look at it but don't use it. It's not dishwasher proof (my grandmother probably never saw a dishwasher), it's a pain to clean (my grandmother was used to things being a pain to clean), it spews blood around while grinding (my grandmother probably never thought about that - "it is what it is" - as all her friends' grinders did the same), I have to find a place to clamp it and there's no rational place to do so my kitchen (but probably was in my grandmother's kitchen). If you care about "quality" (or false pretenses of same), you're not shopping at Walmart, Home Depot, Target, or McDonalds. However, every one of those vendors has multiple competitors who DO offer quality products and better selection (of course at a higher price). For a tiny example, if you want selection and access to quality products, check out McMaster-Carr [mcmaster.com] or similar -- but make sure you've got a high limit on your credit card.

American health care corporations have been publicly funded for decades, but not healthcare itself. Also you're spending far more than countries with public health care. 2015 expenditure per capita in USD: Australia = $4420 Canada = $4608 France = $ 4407 Germany $ 5267 UK = $4003 US = $9451 Out of the 35 OCED countries, the US is the most expensive with Luxembourg taking up the number 2 spot ($7765). Out of the 217 countries surveyed by the WHO, the US is 217. You can take 27 off of that number if you like because the WHO has no statistics for 27 nations, but I'd find it hard to believe that French Polynesia has a significantly higher health care spend than the US. So it isn't that the US doesn't have the money to spend, its just that the system is completely wrong.

This is why you can walk down almost any aisle in Walmart, if you can find one which has actually been stocked, and see what seems like every third product sporting "BONUS! NOW 30% MORE FREE!" stickers and packaging. This is not being done because the vendor is thrilled to give away 30% more for free, but because Walmart has threatened them to either provide a better value in terms of more product for the same price OR pay Walmart to carry the product OR provide some sort of deal on making a private label version of something Walmart needs, OR if none of those work, Walmart will evict them from the shelves. If you are a vendor who derives a huge percentage of sales from Walmart, you have to think hard whether it makes sense to throw away all those sales or do as Walmart demands and come up with a bonus package or provide some other service Walmart wants. In most cases, Walmart demands sales results from everybody. If you are taking up shelf space, and even if your company paid for it, you better sell product, or Walmart WILL kick you. They may also demand that jobbers be sent in to do stocking, but this mainly happens to soft drink and snack chips. In my area, Utz bought shelf space but the stuff didn't sell and they didn't want to do "Bonus! 90MILLION OUNCES FREE!" bullshit and eventually Walmart kicked them out. Which kind of sucks since the stores are supplied by 1099 contractor route salespeople who can't offer better deals to Walmart because those decisions are made at a much higher level, and then they get kicked out and lose what sales they were making there.

It is called learning to live within your means, sacrifice and savings. I know...old fashioned concepts but they still are valid. I'm not poor (I've been the broke student starting out tho)....and I'm not wealthy, but I do upper middle income ok. But even in my pooer days, as even today...I quite often have some things, some necessary like tools, other are plain outright toys...but in many if not most cases, they are of higher quality and build than what most of my peers have. How? Well, I tend to have a clear image of what is important to me. If I want "X"....I generally spend a LOT of time researching the shit out of it...I find what I consider to be the best in class. I see how much I have to save to get it, and decide on what things I currently spend money on, that I can do without for awhile so I can save at a more rapid timeline. I buy what I want and I am happy, no buyers remorse....and hey, the best isn't always the most $$, but when it is, I don't cheap out. Yes, some people come by and go "OOOooh you must have a lot of $$". Well, no that's not the case. I just drank a little less, didn't go out as much, and cut corners where I could to SAVE money....and also be patient to wait on a good deal when it pops up. I try to have a little savings in a "toy" savings at all times. I put at least a tiny bit away...for that semi-impulse buy when a great deal pops up for a very limited opportunity time. For the most part, I try to have cash on hand to buy most any of these things. Even then, I will often keep that cash standing by....and use a interest free payment on these things (mostly with Amazon store card 6-12 months). That way I pay things out and can keep that cash on hand in savings earning at least a tiny bit of interest. But living within ones means, sacrifice....if you can exercise at least a modicum of self control...life can still be good. I've been doing this since I was a young teen...doing neighborhood jobs saving for a year to get what at the end was a HIGH end skate board. I've been building my stereo since I was about 12yrs. What I have now blows away what others have....many of them have Dr. money which I certainly do not...yet, they are amazed at how my stereo sound. I've been building it for years by saving, swapping out parts as deals came along, etc. It isn't hard and geez, I am NOT the most disciplined person around, but fiscally I do try to exercise a little common sense.

I know it's popular these days to brush off those in poverty and accuse them of either making bad choices, or squandering their money, or being lazy, but some of the poorest people I know are also some of the most disciplined. It takes more discipline than I have to live off of white bread and sliced cheese for three days so that you can pay an electric bill, or to stay home on a Friday night because the $4 that you'd spend on bus fare or gasoline to visit a friend across town is needed for the laundromat, but those are the types of choices that people in poverty have to face every day! To someone in the middle class, $60 a year on shoes doesn't seem like much. What about clothes? A winter coat? Furniture? Blankets for your bed? And god forbid you want some luxury item like a vacuum cleaner or you have an unexpected medical expense.

There. That is the difference. When you order from Amazon with a two-day delivery, you can reasonably expect Amazon will hit that goal, pretty much all the time. It's extremely dependable. When you do an equivalent order from Walmart, well... they may not even ship it for two days, and it may ship ground from halfway across the country, and may show up for in-store pickup in five or seven days. I ordered a TV with two-day delivery a couple summers ago, so not during Christmas or any rush period. Silly me, I assumed two-day meant two-day. In reality, they shipped it via Fedex Ground from over 1000 miles away, and it took five whole days, not two, and then I had to stand in line in the store for 45 minutes behind people doing returns and buying Western Union and money orders, just to claim my item, which they initially could not find. Mind you, it was a 40" TV so not small or anything. It turned out they had been using my TV box to prop open the door to the pick-up area. More recently, I tried to order a smartphone for in-store pick-up. It was supposed to be at the store and I could just walk in and get it, but I did pick-up just to save time. Paid for it online before the store opened for the day and waited for the email to come pick it up. Never got the email. So I called them. And well, they never bothered to go fulfil the online orders that morning and the stock they had, including the one I had already paid for, got sold when the doors opened and regular customers came in. And now they were out of stock and sucks to be me. Nobody in the store gave a shit. Online is a whole other department and nobody in the store felt any responsibility to do anything for them. At best, they worried only about their own store stuff, not online orders, so nobody even cared that they had failed to secure an item that had been paid for. Oh well. This happens so often, the online side instantly refunded the money the moment I asked. That's the only thing that actually happened as promised. Refunds. tl;dr Walmart has grand goals to be like Amazon but they drop the ball in making it happen. Their ads promise what they can't deliver, so no, it's not equivalent at all.

It was 'in stock' so I ordered online and opted for in store pickup. Lo and behold it was not in stock and could not be substituted. However, Walmart said it would take up to 30 days to refund my money (over 95% of the money I had in my name at the time). But, they could take it instantly. Granted, a portion of the blame here also resides with PayPal, but still extremely frustrating. I burned up almost all the minutes on my then pre-paid flip phone with Walmart and Paypal trying to resolve it. Side note, it is hard as fuck.

Saritha RaiP. R. Sanjai Radhakishan Damani. D-Mart outlets follow a simple design—wide aisles on white-tiled floors under fluorescent tube lights. Bangalore/Mumbai: Radhakishan Damani may be India’s Sam Walton. Like the Walmart founder, he’s a self-made billionaire from humble beginnings with a successful formula for retailing. So successful that when Damani’s 15-year-old company, Avenue Supermarts Ltd, went public last week, the stock price more than doubled on the first day of trading in Mumbai, valuing his direct family’s interest at about $3.6 billion. The reason has much to do with Damani’s strategy of offering knockdown prices on everything from lentils to laundry powder in multistory hypermarkets on India’s urban fringes. By appealing to homemakers with cheap, reliable staples and giving them ample parking in convenient locations, Damani has not only successfully countered the threat from online retailers, but beat them on earnings. Amazon.com Inc., the global giant that’s investing $5 billion in the Indian market, and Flipkart Online Services Pvt., the biggest domestic e-commerce company, are yet to make money in India, whereas Avenue Supermarts said it had net profit after tax of Rs3.2 billion ($49.3 million) in the year ended March 2016. “The low-cost ethos that was embedded into the Walmart chain by Sam Walton has become the hallmark of Damani, who’s ingrained it into his Avenue Supermarts,” said Arvind Singhal, chairman of retail consultancy Technopak Advisors Pvt., which tracks retail trends in India. “Like Walmart, Damani has stuck to a single format and peddled a significant proportion of private-label goods from the very beginning.” Stag profit Avenue Supermarts’ shares jumped as high as Rs650 before closing at Rs641.6 on their 21 March debut, compared with an initial public offering price of Rs299. The share sale raised Rs18.7 billion, attracted bids for 106 times the quantity available, and was the best IPO performance in India in four years. The shares closed at Rs631.85 in Mumbai Thursday, valuing the company at Rs394 billion. Also Read | Radhakishan Damani quiet as ever after stellar D-Mart listing For 61-year-old Damani, a former stockbroker who was raised in a one-room apartment in a Mumbai tenement block, the listing catapulted Damani’s wealth beyond that of Ajay Piramal, Anil Ambani and Kapil Bhatia, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Damani and his direct family have financial interests in Avenue Supermarts amounting to about 60% of the company. Soft-spoken with a preference for white clothing, Damani eschews media attention. He earned hundreds of millions of dollars from successful stock market investments that he used to kick-start a bricks-and-mortar retailing business just when many merchandisers were focusing on e-commerce. Damani wasn’t available for an interview, an external spokesperson for the company said. Urban sprawl The retail chain, with its 129 D Mart stores in more than 40 cities, is now more valuable than local rivals Future Retail, Aditya Birla Fashion and Trent Ltd combined. Stores typically cater to bargain shoppers in the heartlands of India’s urban sprawl. Importantly, the land is acquired before real estate prices in the area have surged, said Arun Kejriwal, director at KRIS, an investment advisory firm. “We observe our customers and plan for them,” said Neville Noronha, managing director and chief executive officer at Avenue Supermarts, adding that D Mart’s business model has evolved since its first store opened in 2002. It centers largely on everyday low prices—a concept reminiscent of Walmart Stores Inc., the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company started by Sam Walton in 1962. Avenue’s approach is also to procure merchandise at low prices and to avoid relying on sporadic promotions on specific products, the Mumbai-based company said in a regulatory filing in September. ‘Unfancy stores’ “D-Mart has unfancy stores,” said Technopak’s Singhal. “If other retailers became counter-intuitive and chased retail glamour by opening stores in malls, launching multiple formats and going national, D-Mart has been intuitive by sticking to the very basics.” It doesn’t hire high-profile executives, pay “stratospheric” salaries or overspend on marketing and advertising—all of which are hallmarks of Indian retailers, Singhal said. “It’s not like Damani has stumbled on some magic formula—he hasn’t,” Singhal said. “These should have been the basic rules for every retail business in India.” D-Mart outlets follow a simple design: wide aisles on white-tiled floors under fluorescent tube lights. Elevators move shoppers and their trolleys between levels, with groceries and food staples located below household goods and sports equipment, and textiles and soft furnishings on the floor above. No time to clean “D-Mart offers me the best prices, and the grains are very clean—which is a big advantage over other retail stores in the vicinity,” said Varsha Nilesh Benke, a 35-year-old office worker, while on a twice-monthly weekend shop at the Seawoods store, 35 kilometers (22 miles) from downtown Mumbai. “Since I’m a working woman, I don’t have time to clean grains.” Benke said she’s happy to purchase apparel online, but prefers to see for herself the rice and pulses she needs before buying. “D-Mart also offers free gift-wrapping services, which makes it convenient to buy a gift here,” Benke added. Retiree V.P. Sharma, who lives in Navi Mumbai, a satellite town east of the city, also says D-Mart has a distinct advantage over online retailers. “They show something on the net and deliver something else,” he said, while shopping at the same store. “Also, the delivery at odd hours, making e-commerce very inconvenient.” India hasn’t yet reached its retail renaissance, Boston Consulting Group said in a 21 March report, in which it predicted the South Asian nation will become the world’s third-largest consumer market by 2025. Domestic consumption will triple to $4 trillion by the middle of the next decade as rising affluence drives consumer behavior and spending, including in nascent agglomerations like the ones D-Mart is focusing on. “Damani may not have the size and scale of Walmart, but certainly Damani is Sam Walton in the making,” said Kejriwal at KRIS.

Dmitriy S. Sveshnikov, 22, faces two allegations of indecent liberties in connection with the March 15 incident. Battle Ground police were dispatched about 5:15 p.m. to the Wal-Mart at 1201 S.W. 13th Ave., for a report of a sex crime. A 16-year-old girl was groped by an unknown man inside the store, according to an affidavit of probable cause. The girl told police she was shopping alone in the toy aisle when a man approached her and grabbed her “butt” from behind. When she turned around, she saw the man, whom she didn’t recognize, standing close to her. She said the incident happened quickly but that she asked him, “What are you doing?” She said the man “smirked” at her and then walked away down the aisle, the affidavit states. The girl said she kept shopping but saw the same man from a distance over the next several minutes. While standing in the check-out line, she noticed a female Wal-Mart employee who appeared to be upset and crying, and then “it hit me,” she told police. She said she thought the same thing may have happened to the employee, according to court documents. She told an assistant manager what had happened and described the man and what he was wearing to police. The assistant manager reported that an employee was also grabbed, court records said. That employee was working near the fitting rooms when the man walked passed her, grabbed her “butt” and kept walking. She said she turned and yelled at him, but he didn’t respond, the affidavit states. Police obtained surveillance footage of the suspect entering and leaving the store and an image of the pickup he was driving. The information and photos were released to the public March 21. Several tipsters reported seeing the pickup in the Battle Ground and Vancouver areas. One caller identified the driver as “Dmitriy,” according to court documents. Sveshnikov called the police department March 22 and said he recognized himself from the press release. He stated that he didn’t know why police were looking for him and that he didn’t do anything wrong. He wanted to clear his name, he said, and reported to the department. Sveshnikov denied contacting or grabbing anyone at the store and said he believed it was a case of mistaken identity, court records state. He will retain his own attorney, court records show, and his bail was set at $20,000. He will be arraigned April 13.   Jessica Prokop Columbian Courts Reporter  360-735-4551  @jprokop16  Send an Email Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

ADD TO PORTFOLIO ADD TO WATCHLIST SHARE YOUR OULOOK ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz PEER COMPANIES Tax planning: How to complete all tax work before March 31 By Saritha Rai and P R Sanjai Radhakishan Damani may be India’s Sam Walton. Like the Wal-Mart founder, he’s a self-made billionaire from humble beginnings with a successful formula for retailing. So successful that when Damani’s 15-year-old company, Avenue Supermarts Ltd., went public last week, the stock price more than doubled on the first day of trading in Mumbai, valuing his direct family’s interest at about $3.6 billion. The reason has much to do with Damani’s strategy of offering knockdown prices on everything from lentils to laundry powder in multistory hypermarkets on India’s urban fringes. By appealing to homemakers with cheap, reliable staples and giving them ample parking in convenient locations, Damani has not only successfully countered the threat from online retailers, but beat them on earnings. Amazon.com Inc., the global giant that’s investing $5 billion in the Indian market, and Flipkart Online Services Pvt., the biggest domestic e-commerce company, are yet to make money in India, whereas Avenue Supermarts said it had net profit after tax of 3.2 billion rupees ($49.3 million) in the year ended March 2016. “The low-cost ethos that was embedded into the Wal-Mart chain by Sam Walton has become the hallmark of Damani, who’s ingrained it into his Avenue Supermarts,” said Arvind Singhal, chairman of retail consultancy Technopak Advisors Pvt., which tracks retail trends in India. “Like Wal-Mart, Damani has stuck to a single format and peddled a significant proportion of private-label goods from the very beginning.” Stag Profit Avenue Supermarts’ shares jumped as high as 650 rupees before closing at 641.6 rupees on their March 21 debut, compared with an initial public offering price of 299 rupees. The share sale raised 18.7 billion rupees, attracted bids for 106 times the quantity available, and was the best IPO performance in India in four years. The shares closed at 631.85 rupees in Mumbai Thursday, valuing the company at 394 billion rupees ($6 billion). For 61-year-old Damani, a former stockbroker who was raised in a one-room apartment in a Mumbai tenement block, the listing catapulted Damani’s wealth beyond that of Ajay Piramal, Anil Ambani and Kapil Bhatia, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Damani and his direct family have financial interests in Avenue Supermarts amounting to about 60 percent of the company. Soft-spoken with a preference for white clothing, Damani eschews media attention. He earned hundreds of millions of dollars from successful stock market investments that he used to kick-start a bricks-and-mortar retailing business just when many merchandisers were focusing on e-commerce. Damani wasn’t available for an interview, an external spokesperson for the company said. Urban Sprawl The retail chain, with its 129 D-Mart stores in more than 40 cities, is now more valuable than local rivals Future Retail, Aditya Birla Fashion and Trent Ltd. combined. Stores typically cater to bargain shoppers in the heartlands of India’s urban sprawl. Importantly, the land is acquired before real estate prices in the area have surged, said Arun Kejriwal, director at KRIS, an investment advisory firm. “We observe our customers and plan for them,” said Neville Noronha, managing director and chief executive officer at Avenue Supermarts, adding that D-Mart’s business model has evolved since its first store opened in 2002. It centers largely on everyday low prices -- a concept reminiscent of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company started by Sam Walton in 1962. Avenue’s approach is also to procure merchandise at low prices and to avoid relying on sporadic promotions on specific products, the Mumbai-based company said in a regulatory filing in September. ‘Unfancy Stores’ “D-Mart has unfancy stores,” said Technopak’s Singhal. “If other retailers became counter-intuitive and chased retail glamour by opening stores in malls, launching multiple formats and going national, D-Mart has been intuitive by sticking to the very basics.” It doesn’t hire high-profile executives, pay “stratospheric” salaries or overspend on marketing and advertising -- all of which are hallmarks of Indian retailers, Singhal said. “It’s not like Damani has stumbled on some magic formula -- he hasn’t,” Singhal said. “These should have been the basic rules for every retail business in India.” D-Mart outlets follow a simple design: wide aisles on white-tiled floors under fluorescent tube lights. Elevators move shoppers and their trolleys between levels, with groceries and food staples located below household goods and sports equipment, and textiles and soft furnishings on the floor above. No Time to Clean “D-Mart offers me the best prices, and the grains are very clean -- which is a big advantage over other retail stores in the vicinity,” said Varsha Nilesh Benke, a 35-year-old office worker, while on a twice-monthly weekend shop at the Seawoods store, 35 kilometers (22 miles) from downtown Mumbai. “Since I’m a working woman, I don’t have time to clean grains.” Benke said she’s happy to purchase apparel online, but prefers to see for herself the rice and pulses she needs before buying. “D-Mart also offers free gift-wrapping services, which makes it convenient to buy a gift here,” Benke added. Retiree V.P. Sharma, who lives in Navi Mumbai, a satellite town east of the city, also says D-Mart has a distinct advantage over online retailers. “They show something on the net and deliver something else,” he said, while shopping at the same store. “Also, the delivery at odd hours, making e-commerce very inconvenient.” India hasn’t yet reached its retail renaissance, Boston Consulting Group said in a March 21 report, in which it predicted the South Asian nation will become the world’s third-largest consumer market by 2025. Domestic consumption will triple to $4 trillion by the middle of the next decade as rising affluence drives consumer behavior and spending, including in nascent agglomerations like the ones D-Mart is focusing on. “Damani may not have the size and scale of Wal-Mart, but certainly Damani is Sam Walton in the making,” said Kejriwal at KRIS.

Scott Hilton, chief revenue officer for Walmart eCommerce U.S., and Steve Breen, senior vice president of merchandising for Walmart.com, shared strategy insights with suppliers at the Wal-Street Speaker Series event held in Bentonville on Thursday (Mar. 31). Breen opened the meeting saying the Jet.com acquisition has been transformational for Wal-Mart’s online business. Hilton, who joined Wal-Mart with the Jet.com acquisition, said nearly all retail categories are moving online. He said when Amazon started with books years ago it made sense when lots of other categories did not. Hilton who also worked for Quidsi, parent of Diapers.com, said gradually many more categories have shifted online. Clothing, footwear, jewelry and watches will in the next three years see more than $30 billion in e-commerce growth in the U.S,  according to Forrester Research. Even laggard categories like pets are poised to see roughly $5 billion in additional e-commerce growth by 2020. Home and garden is expected to pick up $10 billion in online revenue growth and consumer electronics could see $30 billion in incremental online revenue over the next three years. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates U.S. e-commerce revenue will grow from just more than $400 billion this year to $600 billion by 2020. Hilton said the online revenue is a mere fraction of the $2.9 trillion offline retail market in the U.S. The executives said it’s a mistake for suppliers to underestimate the importance mobile phones are playing in e-commerce sales. Of the $343 billion in U.S. e-commerce sales last year, one third were completed by mobile devices – a whopping $115 billion in retail sales made from a mobile device. More importantly Hilton said customers today are just shopping and they may move between several devices looking at items online and then eventually make the purchase in a store. Breen said Walmart.com wants customers to use their mobile phones while in-store to make their shopping experience more pleasant and the retailer also wants the online experience with the mobile phone to be equally satisfying. CATEGORY EXPERTISE One major change at Walmart.com is that Lore wants category managers to know their products A to Z. He said last week at the ShopTalk Conference in Las Vegas that the recent acquisitions of Moosejaw, ShoeBuy, ModCloth and Hayneedle through the Jet.com deal gives the Walmart a major advantage in certain categories which is why he is putting those subsidiary CEOs in charge of specific categories for the entire operation. Breen said MIke Sorabella is going to be responsible for shoes not only sold on ShoeBuy but also the entire retail shoe business on Walmart.com and Jet.com. “Mike has a team of 220 people in Boston who really know footwear and how to sell it online because that is all they do. We would have previously had a buyer that focused half the day on shoes and the other half on say flannel shirts, which maybe a bigger category,” Breen said. The same will be true of Hayneedle for home furnishings, Moosejaw for outdoor adventure gear and apparel, and ModCloth for trendy ladies fashion and accessories. While the subsidiary CEOs will oversee the category, Scott said there is also 28 category managers at walmart.com responsible for the entire category, regardless if the goods are sold at only Walmart.com or also Jet.com and the other online stores. Hilton said there is no way Wal-Mart is going to collapse the recent acquisition sites and roll them under the Walmart brand. He said they will exist and flourish separately which will benefit Wal-Mart Stores in the long run. He said the new category teams are deeply focused on the items but also the user experiences regardless of which site customers are shopping. ‘IT’S’ PROTOCOL Breen said this past year Walmart.com began growing its online inventory from around 5 million to start the year to 30 million items at year-end. He said the retailer now has about 35 million items on its website. He said having a broad assortment is just part of the retailer’s new strategy that it calls “It’s.” Lore previously mentioned the new “It’s” protocol, but Breen and HIlton gave suppliers more details around the new strategy they say will make a difference for shoppers online and in store. The “It” strategy has five components. 1. Have it 2. Find it 3. Display it 4. Price it 5. Deliver it Breen said that the top 1 million items sold online account for roughly two-thirds of total online sales, which means Wal-Mart is focused on making sure it has those top selling items. By having the item, the products must be in the fulfillment centers. “After we know we have physically have those items in our possession, we also also work with our market-place suppliers to ensure they have them too,” Breen said. Hilton said it’s easy to look back and see the top selling items, but knowing what they will be in the future is “a forward-looking problem.” He said knowing the products and categories well will ensure the retailer gets the right with the help of its suppliers. Hilton said for customers to “find it” suppliers will need to step up their participation in furnishing the specific product content to increase the searchability. He said the retailer will do its part by furnishing customers with easy re-order buttons, but for the sale to take place they must first be able to easily find what they are looking for online, regardless of what device they use. Breen said the next step of “display it” also requires help from suppliers. He said having accurate, searchable content, high resolution photos and videos when applicable can be a difference maker in converting searches into sales. He said the retailer recently worked on content for plastic storage bags and the team spent time on specific details of the bags, such as ziplock closures, count in box, ounces each bag would hold and after supplying the deep level details, sales nearly doubled. Hilton also implored suppliers to give the retailer all the products it makes. “We want to see your entire product catalog, that means everything you make. Give us all the products you have because the general manager can know which products best fit the various sites available. This streamlined approach for category management means you have just one contact regardless if you sell on Walmart.com, Jet.com and perhaps Hayneedle or ShoeBuy.” The fourth prong in the plan regarding pricing the items is self explanatory. Breen said the retailer is working to ensure the online and in-store prices match to instill consumer trust. He said the general managers will set the price, while also making sure it’s competitive with Amazon and other retailers. He said getting the lowest price from suppliers is a big help in that endeavor. Hilton re-emphasized the importance of a low cost of goods to the retailer’s overall plan. He told suppliers that if there is some way to change the packaging that could reduce shipping costs, those plans can be worked out with the retailer. “We want to help suppliers take costs out of the supply chain where we can do so,” Hilton said. The fifth prong in the plan is to “deliver it” in a way that pleases the customer. Sometimes that will be picking it up on their way home. Other times it could be two-day delivery at home with a minimum $35 ticket. He said the $35 minimum order was set to encourage customers to engage in building a basket, and wasn’t totally arbitrary. He said two-day home delivery is more like “table stakes” today but said the company does it without an annual subscription fee. When asked if there is any plans to combine SamsClub.com with the Walmart.com sites, Hilton said absolutely not. He said SamsClub.com has its own dedicated e-commerce team focused on that separate business. When asked to quantify what the Jet.com purchase meant for the two companies Hilton said it gave Jet.com and now the other subsidiaries instant scale and financial stability. “Retail is a scale game and Walmart gave that to Jet overnight,” Hilton said. “Each party also benefits from the experience of the other.” Breen said Wal-Mart gained access to a team of people with much e-commerce experience. He said they are digital natives who understand the importance of mobile and curated content, while also delivering unique shopping experiences that allow them to draw a diverse fan base. –––––––––––––––––- Editor’s note: The Supply Side section of Talk Business & Politics focuses on the companies, organizations, issues and individuals engaged in providing products and services to retailers.

By Spencer Soper and Craig Giammona Bloomberg News  March 30, 2017 SEATTLE — Amazon has invited some of the world’s biggest brands to its Seattle headquarters in an audacious bid to convince them it’s time to start shipping products directly to online shoppers and bypass such chains as Walmart, Target, and Costco. Executives from General Mills, Mondelez, and other packaged goods makers will attend the three-day gathering in May. Attendees will tour an Amazon fulfillment center and hear a presentation from worldwide consumer chief Jeff Wilke, who reports to founder Jeff Bezos. Advertisement Amazon is looking to upend relationships between brands and brick-and-mortar stores that for decades have determined how popular products are designed, packaged, and shipped. If Amazon succeeds, big brands will think less about creating products that stand out in a Walmart aisle. Instead, they’ll focus on designing products that can be shipped quickly to customers’ doorsteps. Brands have been experimenting with such changes, so the Seattle event may well resonate. Get Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news, delivered weekdays. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here ‘‘Times are changing,’’ Amazon says in an invitation obtained by Bloomberg. ‘‘Amazon strongly believes that supply chains designed to serve the direct-to-consumer business have the power to bring improved customer experiences and global efficiency. To achieve this requires a major shift in thinking.’’ Manufacturers would have to reimagine everything from the way products are made to how they’re packaged. Laundry detergent could come in sturdier, leak-proof containers. Instead of flimsy packages designed to pop on store shelves, cookies, crackers, and cereal could be packed in durable, unadorned boxes. Factories could spit out products for individuals rather than trucks-full of inventory. It’s unclear who would handle the shipping, though Amazon offers a range of fulfillment services. The company declined to comment. Amazon has been struggling to crack the food and packaged goods market — an $800 billion category still dominated by Walmart and other traditional chains. Persuading brands to design their packaging and operations for the online world would make it easier for Amazon to ship common household goods to urban dwellers in less than an hour, potentially making last-minute dashes to the store obsolete. Advertisement Amazon must convince brands that even though online purchases represent a small part of their sales now, e-commerce is the future. ‘‘Most of these people haven’t been interested in e-commerce because e-commerce has been such a small piece of their overall sales,’’ says Melissa Burdick, vice president of e-commerce at The Mars Agency marketing firm. ‘‘But we’ve reached a tipping point. We’re at a time when companies are ready to start figuring this stuff out.’’ Amazon is looking to influence product makers the same way Costco and other club stores persuaded brands more than 20 years ago to create bulk sizes sold at a discount. ‘‘There was a big perceived penalty for missing the boat, fear of missing out on growth,’’ says Jim Hertel, senior vice president at the marketing firm Inmar. Just like Costco, he says, Amazon will encourage the changes by promising increased sales, a welcome pitch for companies struggling to rekindle sales growth amid rapidly changing consumer tastes and shopping habits. Amazon has already forced some manufacturers to revolutionize their packaging. For years toy and electronics makers have packaged their wares to help prevent theft and to maximize store display. But the packages’ tough plastic was hard to open, turning off millions of consumers. Amazon pushed manufacturers to develop packages that pop open more easily. Today thousands of ‘‘frustration-free’’ products are sold on its site. Some brands will be easier to persuade than others. One could be Nike, which has an Amazon store and has been experimenting with selling directly to consumers. Nike chief executive Eric Sprunk is scheduled to speak at Amazon’s Seattle gathering. The event’s cohost is SCM World, a research and conference group that serves the supply-chain industry. SCM’s advisory board includes executives from Unilever, Kimberly-Clark, and Land O’ Lakes butter. Amazon’s pitch comes as brick-and-mortar competitors try to blunt its momentum by enhancing their own online shopping options. Walmart and other big-box retailers are experimenting with such concepts as buy online, pick up in store. Startups Instacart and Deliv make deliveries from stores to homes, helping retailers keep up with Amazon. Looking to match the quick delivery benefits of Amazon Prime membership, Walmart offers a free two-day delivery on orders of $35 or more. Loading comments...

Walmart Man catches snake after it bites someone in Jacksonville Walmart THV11 Digital , KTHV 5:05 PM. CDT March 31, 2017 Credit: Linda Moore Mathews CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JACKSONVILLE, Ark. (KTHV) - A man has been bitten by a Copperhead snake inside of the Walmart in Jacksonville. "Everyone was freaking out," said Linda Mathews, who snapped a picture of the snake. A video sent to KHOU sister station KTHV by Darla Duncan shows a customer catching the snake after it bit the man. According to Jacksonville Animal Control, the Copperhead was de-fanged, which is done typically if the snake is kept as a pet. The snake's front two fangs had been removed, but it does still have venomous glands. The man was taken to the hospital for treatment.   At this time, it's unknown how the snake entered the store.

PUBLISHED : Saturday, 01 April, 2017, 8:00am UPDATED : Saturday, 01 April, 2017, 8:00am Comments:   Eric Ng eric.mpng@scmp.com http://twitter.com/EricNgSCMP Share PrintEmail Related topics Li & Fung Trade More on this story Companies Doubts rise over Li & Fung future 9 Feb 2013 Downturn erodes Li & Fung earnings 15 Aug 2012 Investors shun Li & Fung shares 1 Jul 2011 Companies Investors turn bullish on Li & Fung after makeover 3 Mar 2014 Li & Fung answers the doubters 23 Jun 2011 Related Articles Business How four generations left their mark in Li & Fung 1 Apr 2017 Companies Li & Fung needs to focus on its core businesses - and get rid of the rest 4 Apr 2014 Companies Investors turn bullish on Li & Fung after makeover 3 Mar 2014 Li & Fung is trying to reinvent itself for the eighth time in 24 years. The company, the world’s largest sourcing agent for Wal-Mart Stores and Macy’s, will fully embrace information technology -- which has already upended its century-old role as the quintessential middle person between producers and consumers -- and is investing heavily to transform its business. The transformation was given extra urgency this week, when chief operating officer Spencer Fung delivered Li & Fung’s third consecutive year of profit decline, missing analysts’ estimates with a 24 per cent slump. Core operating profit tumbled 44 per cent over three years while the profit margin narrowed by 1.4 percentage point to 2.5 per cent. “This has been one of the toughest trading environments Li & Fung has ever seen,” Fung said. Li & Fung’s 2016 revenue fell for the third year, declining 11 per cent to US$16.8 billion, the lowest since 2009. The only bright spot in its results was the logistics business, which reported a 15.5 per cent growth in core operating profit, where the profit margin widened to 6.7 per cent due to rising e-commerce demand and expansions into the Japanese and South Korean markets. Even so, depressed global freight rates and unfavourable currency movements meant the logistics operation failed to meet its goal of doubling its US dollar profit in the three years to last year. Decline in sourcing and trading profit was to a small extent offset by higher earnings from Li & Fung’s growing services business where it helps factories cut material and finance costs, move to cheaper locations and comply with increasingly stringent health and safety rules. Li & Fung was founded in Guangzhou in 1906 by Fung’s great grandfather. For more than a century, the company grew and prospered through its role as broker, facilitating trade and manufacturing between the mainland Chinese hinterland with the rest of the world. The advent of the internet and e-commerce have dealt a severe blow to the company’s business, as customers and producers can now reach each other directly. To reverse its fortunes, the company proposed a new three-year plan, after meeting its sales and profit goals in four of eight three-year plans made since 1993. It’s fallen to Fung, 43, to turn things around. The Harvard University graduate took over the reins of the company as chief executive in 2014. Fung this week announced a three-year, US$150 million plan to invest in information technology hardware and software, and to hire people who can use them, as the firm seeks to create “the supply chain of the future.” The key plank of the strategy is to bring its semi-digital operation to full digitisation, from product development, material costing, sampling, manufacturing and logistics. “A digital supply chain is essential to service a highly digitalised marketplace,” Fung said. Fung’s plan aims to halve the time it takes for products to move from concept to deliver to 21 weeks by 2019, from the current 40 weeks. That helps retailers better adjust to customers’ changing preferences and shopping behaviour more quickly, and help them compete with the online shopping platforms. This involves “rapid prototyping” by using “virtual sampling” and “digital showroom” technology to cut the time needed to design, make, and seek approvals for product samples. With Li & Fung’s huge international footprint and annual turnover, it a very large ship to steer. “What used to take weeks and days can now be done in a matter of hours. There are new technologies available today for old economy companies to take advantage of,” Fung said. “The world is moving faster and faster; how we can move as fast as a startup” is the challenge, he said. Not only is speed key to turning around Li & Fung’s sagging profits, the vast quantity of data at its disposal is also important for making its supply chain more efficient, cheaper and better able to help customers differentiate their products. Still, not everybody is convinced the new plan could bring a turnaround any time soon. Li & Fung’s shares fell in the two days after its results and its business plan, trading recently near a 14-year low of HK$3.30. Only one analyst out of 13 covering the company is recommending investors “buy” the stock. “We are not yet convinced that the speed and innovation will be able to pull up sales growth notably,” said JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Ebru Kurumlu, the lead analyst in a report with a “neutral” recommendation on the stock, and a projection that the annual operating profit growth will only average 6 per cent over three years. To realise the ambitious goals, Li & Fung also needs a change in mindset for the company’s 22,000 employees, according to Fung. The company used to offer its “solutions to retailers and brand owners who have little knowledge about products and supply chain” in the last 100 years, he said. “Now, our approach is: what is the business model that you want, and how can we help? We can also use this approach with our bigger customers in future.” While the Hang Seng Index has gained almost 10 per cent this year, Li & Fung’s shares have fallen 1 per cent. It was dropped as one of the 50 constituents of Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Stock Index, losing the position it’s held since 2000. Some analysts don’t see any quick fixes to the company’s challenges, even if they agree with its strategic direction, especially since it requires upfront investments that can only be paid off in future years. “We share Li & Fung’s view on the growing importance of speed to market. However, macro and industry challenges will weigh on its earnings outlook,” said Deutsche Bank analysts Anne Ling and John Chou, who forecast 2.7 per cent compound average growth on its core operating profits until 2019.   Most Popular Viewed 1 Cathay Pacific aims for HK$4 billion in cuts over three years 2 Li & Fung’s latest attempt at reinvention bets on technology 3 How four generations left their mark in Li & Fung 4 Job cuts at China’s Big Four banks 5 Hong Kong’s February home price index rises to a record Shared 1 Cathay Pacific aims for HK$4 billion in cuts over three years 2 How four generations left their mark in Li & Fung 3 Li & Fung’s latest attempt at reinvention bets on technology 4 How many ways did North Korea get away with murder? 5 China is on the path to global technology dominance Commented 1 Cathay Pacific aims for HK$4 billion in cuts over three years 2 Rise of the 215 sq ft home as Hong Kong price boom squeezes buyers 3 Racist attacks in India give China the edge in Africa 4 Thousands of polluters in China caught faking emissions data 5 Consuming shark’s fin soup like ‘eating a panda’       You may also like Society The Indonesian child maids of Hong Kong, Singapore 26 Mar 2017 - 12:36am 12 Your partner in the cloud In partnership with: Alibaba Cloud Opinion Why a Beijing-Taipei conflict would be lose-lose on all levels 25 Mar 2017 - 6:34pm 34 Style A.

Authorities: Missing teen spotted with teacher in Oklahoma Updated: Mar 31, 2017 - 6:49 PM Twtter NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - There's been a confirmed sighting in Oklahoma of a 15-year-old girl who disappeared more than two weeks ago with her 50-year-old teacher, Tennessee authorities said Friday. Surveillance images from a Walmart in Oklahoma City show teacher Tad Cummins and Elizabeth Thomas purchasing food items in the store with cash, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said. The statement said the images captured on March 15 show Cummins had altered his hair to appear darker and Thomas may have changed her hair color to red. The two were reported missing on March 13 from Culleoka, a Tennessee community about 60 miles south of Nashville. Police have issued an Amber alert for Thomas and say they have warrants charging Cummins with sexual contact with a minor and aggravated kidnapping. Also on Friday, the teacher's wife of 31 years filed for divorce. Court records show that Jill Cummins sued her missing husband on the grounds of irreconcilable differences and inappropriate marital conduct. The wife, who works for the Maury County school system, says she has not seen her husband since March 13. The couple has two children together. Jill Cummins has previously publicly pleaded with her husband to turn himself in and bring the girl home safely. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Posey and U.S. Secret Service Special Agent in Charge Michael Williams. Hall worked as a front desk clerk at a hotel on Pelham Parkway in Pelham in October 2013, according to the statement. While at work on Oct. 11, 2013, Hall obtained a Regions Bank card belonging to a hotel customer identified in the indictment as P.T. Without authorization, Hall used the card for purchases at Walmart, Piggly Wiggly and Beauty Masters, according to the indictment. She also used the card to withdraw funds from P.T.'s Regions account. The multiple transactions totaled more than $3,000. The three wire fraud counts are related to separate bankcard purchases made at Walmart on Montclair Road in Birmingham. The indictment charges Hall with aggravated identity theft for using the bankcard, a means of identification of P.T., in connection to the wire fraud. The indictment also includes notice that the government will seek a longer sentence, of up to 10 years, if Hall is convicted because the criminal acts occurred while she was on supervised release after serving time on a 2007 conviction in federal court, according to the statement. Hall was indicted in 2006 for getting the names, dates of birth and Social Security numbers of certain Baptist Health System employees during the fall of 2004 and using that information to obtain 33 unauthorized credit cards and using them to get items worth more than $81,000. Hall pleaded guilty and in May 2007 was sentenced to prison for 27 months for fraud and trafficking in a counterfeit device and another 24 months consecutive to that for a charge of fraud with identification documents. On May 23, 2014, a revocation hearing was held and the court revoked Halls defendant's supervised release and sentenced her to 18 months in prison and and 12 months supervised release. That revocation was related to her arrests on a couple of theft charges, including an incident at the Spring Hill Suites hotel where a guest reported the theft of his Compass Bank checks and the successful cashing of a check for $400.00 from his account. "The check was reportedly taken from victim 1's hotel room and later cashed by Tiffiany Hall, who was employed as a housekeeper for the hotel," according to a court document. After her arrest in Shelby County last year, Chief U.S. District Court Judge Karon Bowdre again revoked Hall's supervised probation in November and ordered her to serve another six months in prison. Hall is currently in federal prison awaiting the outcome of the current charges.   The U.S. Secret Service investigated the case, which Assistant U.S. Attorney Tamarra Matthews Johnson is prosecuting.

Tad Cummins and Elizabeth Thomas are seen in the video—taken March 15 but not confirmed or released until Friday—using cash to buy food at the Walmart. According to the Tennessean, the video represents the first images of Cummins and Thomas since the alleged kidnapping on March 13. Cummins appears to have darkened his hair, and Thomas now appears to have red hair, WIAT reports. The video was made public after the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation received a tip Thursday. Cummins was fired from his teaching job following alleged inappropriate contact with Thomas, a student at his school, earlier this year. The two reportedly exchanged potentially romantic emails, though Thomas' family says she once hid from Cummins. There was a possible sighting of Cummins' car in Texas, and there have also been reports Cummins and Thomas are now in Mexico. Investigators have received more than 1,200 tips regarding Cummins and Thomas so far.   My Take on This Story Report a story error Show results without voting  |   6% Hilarious 24% Intriguing 23% Depressing 3% Brilliant 31% Scary 14% Ridiculous Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email Story 43 comments You Might Like Sponsored by ZergNet Comments Read comment policy Showing 3 of 43 comments 312east 1 hour, 20 minutes ago She was probably feeling a bit insecure - like a lot of young girls do - and was flattered to get special attention from her teacher. There are a lot of incidences lately - including this week - when teachers had relationships with their students. Let's hope this girl comes back safely to her family, and this pervert is locked up! anon55344 1 hour, 27 minutes ago You cannot be anonymous anymore. Too much electronic surveillance. K.C. Mar 31, 2017 7:17 PM CDT So the news stories sound more like this was a seduction rather than an abduction. At least the girl seems to be alive. Odd they cannot be caught. Or is it?

A Tennessee teacher who allegedly abducted his teenage student after they were caught kissing was spotted with her at a Walmart in Oklahoma for the first time since the manhunt began, according to a report Friday. Tad Cummins, 50, and Elizabeth Thomas, 15, were captured on camera buying food at the store in Oklahoma City on the afternoon of March 15, CNN reported. The pair have been missing since March 13, several weeks after a student reported she saw him kiss her in his classroom at Culleoka Unit School in Maury County, police said. In the Walmart footage, Cummins had changed his appearance by darkening his hair. Thomas may have also changed her looks by dyeing her hair red, CNN reported. Cummins is driving a silver Nissan Rogue with Tennessee plates and may be armed with two handguns, law enforcement said. He was added to Tennessee’s “Top 10 Most Wanted” list Friday, authorities said. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has received more than 350 tips but no solid leads on tracking down the pair, officials said.

News>Retail & Financial If Amazon is to conquer Walmart, it better conquer profits too Also: Lidl’s new managers; Retailers who show their work Jon Springer | Mar 31, 2017 This post is part of the 10 Items or Less blog Officials of Wal-Mart Stores are fond of remarking that they’d prefer to build an e-commerce business onto a 4,000-store retail platform than to have to do it the other way around. After all, it took Walmart about 50 years to build that many: About half that time was devoted to building a food business within them, and it’s a matter of some debate whether they’ve got that piece where it ought to be yet. Not to mention, they did that all profitably. So in that sense, ringside coverage of the Amazon-Walmart Steel-Cage Match stirred up by a few news stories this week — that Amazon was close to a public opening for its first Amazon Pickup grocery sites, and that it was arranging a summit for CPG manufacturers with an eye toward speeding their transformation toward a direct-to-consumer mindset — is still a bit premature. Including its not-yet-to-the-public convenience and pickup stores, Amazon has 3,997 sites to go and as of now, is fighting for roughly 2% of the grocery business currently done online, and by most accounts they haven’t done that profitably. What Amazon’s moves do signal is that it is looking toward getting its business more like Walmart’s — on the bottom line more so than on the street. Kurt Jetta, founder of Tabs Research, this week said that Amazon’s appeal to the CPG world was “an admission, of sorts, that it is not making money being a conventional retailer/middle-man in the supply chain.” And while it only makes sense for Amazon to try and reduce its supply chain costs, Jetta said what CPG manufacturers “need to consider is whether there is enough revenue potential … to justify antagonizing their brick-and-mortar customers that account for 98% of their business.” It’s dabbling in physical grocery stores — the “cashierless” Amazon Go convenience store and the Pickup points beta testing in Seattle — clearly acknowledge that Amazon, just like everybody else, requires labor from the consumer to make online fulfillment to the home economically feasible. Cooper Smith, head of Amazon research at L2 Inc., a firm that benchmarks digital brands, said this week that Amazon could eventually become a “top five” U.S. grocer, citing an advantage of pre-engaged consumers that already have great trust in its brand. It’s worth noting that both its beta-testing physical formats restrict shopping to Prime loyalty members, who will likely see grocery as another “free” benefit to add to their book-buying, TV streaming and shipping-discounts they already pay for. “Click & collect is nothing new, but the advantage Amazon has over competitors such as Walmart and Kroger is its mobile reach; more than 30 million shoppers use Amazon's mobile app every month — far more than any other legacy retailer,” Smith said. “The scale of Amazon's installed base on mobile devices makes its click & collect fulfillment feature extremely compelling in a competitive market.” Finally there’s the notion that Amazon’s nascent grocery stores could find profits not by selling stuff necessarily, but by selling technology. “Though it's entirely speculative at this point, it's also worth contemplating the possibility that Amazon ultimately leases or licenses some of its automation technology to other retailers,” said Keith Anderson, SVP of Profitero’s Strategy and Insights. “Amazon needn't necessarily own and operate a large network of stores to create value from technology like that reflected by Amazon Go.” “Someone viewed your LinkedIn profile” I admit it; it was me. Don’t mean to be creepy, just trying to get a rough idea of what’s happening out there. LinkedIn tells me today there are 891 profiles of Lidl U.S. workers, including a big batch of store managers who have recently completed six-month overseas training and district managers with 18 months of training. Their resumes include about every retailer you’d find in a mall — or at least used to find — and future competitors like Walmart, Kroger, Ahold, Albertsons and Aldi. Picture This When you’ve got a storefront on Fifth Avenue — one of the world’s most expensive retail miles — you had better find a way to get attention. Pictured here is a North Face apparel store that opened late last year and that I frequently pass on the way to and from the office (incidentally at a former site of Loblaw’s “Joe Fresh” cheap-chic clothing concept that quietly vacated the country). The old-school sewing machines, the hand tools and the garment racks support the store’s custom-embroidery business, and putting a working seamstress in front of the staggering amount of passersby tells a powerful story about the trendy handcraftedness and customization that really stands out in glitzy high-end retail. I always look. Food stores could take a lesson and cook in full view.

Mac Greer (TMFMac) Mar 31, 2017 at 1:37PM On this episode of Market Foolery, Mac Greer is joined by Motley Fool analysts Ron Gross and Jason Moser as they discuss some of the latest news from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) as it expands the Stories feature to its main app.  Meanwhile, Darden Restaurants International (NYSE:DRI) left investors with a tasty earnings beat with an acquisition for dessert, while Whole Foods (NASDAQ:WFM) continues to lose millions of customers. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on March 28, 2017. Mac Greer: It's Tuesday, March 28th. Welcome to Market Foolery! I'm Mac Greer, and joining me in studio, we've got Ron Gross from Total Income and Jason Moser from Motley Fool Million Dollar Portfolio. Gentlemen, welcome! Jason Moser: Hey! Ron Gross: Hey, how are you? Greer: Guys, I'm good. Let's begin with Facebook news that looks a whole lot like Snapchat (NYSE:SNAP). On Tuesday, Facebook released its Stories feature in its main mobile app. Stories allows users to post photos and videos that disappear after 24 hours. Does that sound familiar at all? Stories was already part of other Facebook apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. Now, Jason, they say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. But I'm guessing that if you're Snapchat, you could do without this type of flattery. Moser: I would imagine. I think they're probably thinking, "Wow, at some point, could you not just do something original?" But, I mean, that's the name of this game. Social networking in general, it's innovative to a point, but at the end of the day, it's all about free flow of information and figuring out ways to communicate with people. So, whether you're Facebook or Twitter or Snapchat or Instagram or whatever, you're always figuring out ways to add new little bells and whistles. I do think, as time goes on, it strikes me that -- and I'm not the biggest on these platforms. I really don't use Facebook all that much, I don't use any of these other things, other than Twitter. But I think, it becomes more and more difficult to use these platforms. It seems like they add more and more bells and whistles to the point that it becomes more and more difficult to use, when really, one of the arguments from inception was that they're easy to use. So, I wonder if we're going to hit a point where they become so difficult to use that they start turning people off, because you do hit a point where you start adding so many bells and whistles in the hopes of evolving and innovating that you start scaring people away. I think that's something that, while old people like us might consider Snapchat difficult to use, I think a lot of the kids that use it generally like its simplicity and quick, free-flowing nature. To me, the question with Snapchat has always been what can they be beyond the Snapchat app? And when they went public, when they were doing the roadshow, they redefined themselves as a camera company because even I think they realized that just being Snapchat isn't going to cut it. That's not going to be a way for them to get big and justify the valuation that the market is giving them today. I do think it's important to note that whether you are using Facebook or Instagram or Messenger or WhatsApp, you're still using Facebook. I think that's a testament to the best strategy in this space -- to own a portfolio of a lot of these apps so that you're going to hit every age group. Facebook is kind of for old people. Instagram is maybe Facebook for younger people. Maybe they're trying to turn Messenger into a SnapChat style offering, as well. It's a unique space, but I think it's really difficult to compete with Facebook because they're already so big. Gross: Yeah, I can't argue with any of that, actually -- Moser: Well, that's good. Stop. Gross: [laughs] I don't think Facebook Stories is going to steal any of Snapchat's glory. I don't think Snapchat is actually worried that all of the sudden people are going to start leaving their platform and moving to Facebook. It didn't happen with Instagram, I don't think it will happen with Facebook proper. But it does behoove Facebook to have a complete offering -- to not have that option to create a story and do those things would hurt it a bit. You want to have all the new bells and whistles on your platform, unless, as you said, it becomes a little too complicated. Now, for my mother-in-law, it's going to be too complicated. But she just won't use that part of it, she will continue to like and share things that are embarrassing about her family. But for the folks our age that do want that ability, it's now, there. Greer: And I hear you say that no one is going to leave Snapchat, or, people aren't necessarily going to leave Snapchat to go to Facebook because of this. But if you are Facebook, you're in a much better position than Snapchat. So, you outlast Snapchat, then you're the only game in town. Gross: Absolutely. We've been talking about the usability and the apps and the companies. Then we start to talk about the stock and the capital structure and all that stuff. You would never choose to be Snapchat as opposed to Facebook, the behemoth here, with an airtight balance sheet, cash flow flowing in, just an incredible market position. Snapchat, I wouldn't touch it. Moser: This is less about stealing people using Snapchat, and more about giving folks a reason not to leave any one of those four Facebook platforms. Snapchat has 158 million daily users or something like that. It sounds like a lot, until you compare it to what Facebook has, and then you realize it doesn't really matter, it's relatively inconsequential, especially when you consider that there's probably a decent amount of cross over there. So, it's really just about Facebook and all of its associated platforms offering the ability to do these extra things as a value add. It's less about stealing Snapchat's users, and more about offering their users more features. Greer: Let's talk about Facebook the stock. Shares up around 25% over the past year. Going forward, what do you think about the stock? Gross: I'm a shareholder. It's hard to make the argument that it's cheap as a value investor, because you have to look out into the future so much and rely so much on the future, so I'll suspend my value investing, I'll take off that hat for a minute and say, I'm a shareholder. I have no intention of selling the stock any time soon, maybe ever. It's the kind of stock that I'm just happy to let sit there, and watch what Zuckerberg can do. Moser: Yeah. I think it's very easy to justify owning this stock today, and hanging on to it indefinitely. We talked a lot about this last decade being the Google decade, this coming decade is probably going to be more of the Facebook decade, given the nature of the move to social. I think that's an advantage that Facebook holds over Google. Google is very utilitarian in nature. You go to Google to find something, and then you go somewhere else when you found what you wanted to find. Facebook is garnering a lot of eyeballs that stick around those properties for a while. So, it strikes me as probably a bigger opportunity over the coming decade to be part of that Facebook story, versus something like Google, given those are the two big players in the ad space. I do want to make the point that, it's a big company today, $400 billion plus. You hear a lot of people talk about, in order for the stock to double, they need to double their market cap. That's not necessarily the case. They could, in theory, buy back shares, return capital to shareholders in certain ways that the company doesn't necessarily have to double for the stock to do well. With that said, it's a very big company. As it stands, it's still just an ad play. Now, I say "just" -- it's a massive market opportunity. But, we've seen how far Google has gotten thus far with it, and that's pretty far. Facebook has already caught up to it, more or less. So, looking out forward, it's a bit of a reach to say this is a no-brainer winner, but I think it's a pretty steady-eddy holding that you could hang on to for a while. Greer: Guys, it was a good day for Darden Restaurants. Shares up big on Tuesday on better than expected earnings and news that Darden's would buy Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen. Gross: That's a good name. Greer: Ron, that's a great name, it's such a great name. We should also mention that Darden's owns Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse, among others. Gross: Capital Grille, my favorite. That's a good one. Greer: Capital Grille. What do you think? Gross: The company is doing good, and a lot of restaurants are not. The results were pretty impressive, just shy of a 1% same store sales across the board. The highlight was Eddie V's, their seafood concept, at a 4.7% same-store sales increase. That's pretty impressive. Olive Garden, where most of their profits come from, and Steve Broido's favorite, of course, for listeners of the radio show, up 1.4%. So, not too shabby either, especially when you look out across the competition and see there's a lot of folks that are struggling right now. Profits were up strong. They increased guidance. Then, as you said, a $780 million acquisition of Cheddar Scratch, 165 locations across 28 states. It's a value chain. Let me hit you with some menu items. Perhaps I could interest you in some baby back ribs or some chicken fingers. Maybe J-Mo would like a Monte Cristo sandwich. Greer: Chicken-fried steak. Gross: Nothing wrong with that. Greer: Chicken-fried steak, Ron. Gross: Well, there's a lot wrong with that.  Greer: [laughs] Bite your tongue! Gross: [laughs] But, this is nice. They're adding a casual dining chain to their portfolio. I like that move. It's hard to say whether or not the $780 million is a good price, because I don't have a lot of financials on this company. We know that they've grown revenue 12% to 15% over the last 10 years. Not too shabby. That sounds good to me. Darden does say it will be accretive to their earnings pretty quickly. That's nice to see as well. Darden doing well. Moser: I continue to be amazed by the performance of Olive Garden's to-go side of the business. It's not a top of mind when I'm looking for something to go. But they have clearly hit on something here. The performance there, it's continued double-digit growth in the to-go segment of the business that's just, I'm astounded. Gross: I've never used it personally. I wonder if Steve has. Moser: I don't remember the last time I went to an Olive Garden, but obviously, a lot of people are going. I think a big catalyst for Darden was when they spun off a lot of the real estate that they owned into Four Corners Property Trust. They had a lot of restaurants in there where they owned the real estate. Basically, they were trying to whittle down their cost structure and just be a really good operator of restaurants. So, they spun off a lot of that property to this property trust. I think it helps shore up the balance sheet. I think it helped them focus on doing one thing and doing really well, and that is bringing a number of good, middle of the road brand names into their universe, and being able to grow those footprints. Again, kind of like that Facebook strategy. Whether you're going to one of these restaurants, you're still going to a Darden restaurant at the end of the day. And that's very good for them. Greer: And I want to go back to the name. I think Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen -- Gross: It's pretty good. Greer: I think that's the greatest name. I think the worst name is Carl's Jr. We still don't know how Carl came into possession of Jr. Because it's Carl's Jr. Gross: It's like Ruth's Chris. Greer: Oh, that's terrible! Gross: Yeah, it's hard to say. Greer: That was some mash up of someone who was married, and then they're not, but, Carl's Jr.? Gross: Cheddar's Scratch does it. Greer: It's confusing. I don't want to be confused. I just want food. Gross: I just want baby back ribs. You just want chicken-fried steak? Greer: You don't like chicken-fried steak? Gross: No, I do, but it's not the healthiest piece of food. Greer: Oh, and all the other items were, I'm sorry. Ron Gross, picture of health. Gross: Smothered in that white gravy, that unidentifiable white gravy. Greer: That's why it's good. We wrap up with tough time for Whole Foods. According to a report from Barclays, Whole Foods traffic has fallen by 14 million customers over the last year and half. That's a 3% drop. I should add that Whole Foods co-founder and CEO John Mackey is on the board of directors of the Motley Fool. Jason, according to the report, Kroger is the big beneficiary. Nearly half of Kroger stores are within three miles of a Whole Foods. Moser: Yeah, it was pretty smart to do that, huh? I guess maybe they felt like they were on to something. This goes back to what we've been talking about a lot in this space. Scale is really a tremendous advantage. Having that big footprint, where you can get things from point A to point B in the quickest fashion, and really carry a very wide selection of offerings, both private branded and brand names, is immensely advantageous. I think what we always wondered with Whole Foods for a time was, would they be able to get rid of that Whole Paychecks moniker that they had earned. It seemed like they were doing a pretty good job of that. They were making that way toward offering more 365 branded items, which certainly were more affordable. And I think that attracted more customers, for a time. But they really have run into a buzzsaw here in that every grocery store concept in the country is copying that model now, and bringing more and more naturals and organics into their mix. And furthermore, we talked about this, Whole Foods doesn't really do a very good job of attracting the crossover consumer. So, they don't have a lot of what people really still want. And that's a big problem, because now you're telling me I have to go to more than one place to get everything. Greer: Yeah, I don't want to do that. Gross: That was always, though. You would go to a regular supermarket for your paper towels and household items. Then, if you wanted organics or really good produce or really good meat and fish, you would pop over to Whole Foods. Two trips. Kind of annoying. Now, Kroger's brand, Harris Teeter, you get a lot of that right there. Now, I do not think the quality of the produce in the meats are the same at Harris Teeter and Whole Foods. Whole Foods still does a better job. If I have a dinner party, I'm still going to Whole Foods. But on a regular, weekly basis, it becomes less necessary to go to Whole Foods, which is never good for a business model. Moser: No. Greer: So, what does this mean if you're Whole Foods investor, or you're someone who's looking at the stock? Gross: I am a Whole Foods investor, and I'm not that thrilled about it lately. Even over the last five years, the stock is down around 30%. In my head, it was a more recent decline. But they've really been on the downturn for quite some time. I'm not a seller yet. To be honest, I'm not sure why I'm not. It's because I like the experience, I'm a consumer and I shop there, and I'll continue to support it as a shareholder. Greer: And you have lunch there a lot. Gross: I have lunch there almost every day. [laughs]  Greer: So, they have their prepared foods, some of the stores have bars now, so they have some built-in advantages, right? Gross: They do. I remain a loyal customer, and therefore, for now, I remain a loyal shareholder as well. Moser: I don't know. I'm not a Whole Foods investor. We did own shares of Whole Foods in Million Dollar Portfolio, but we sold them a little while back. I think really, the icing on the cake for us was in the most recent quarter, when they finally came to reality here in that they needed to pull back on what they saw as their full market opportunity. For a while, they were targeting 1,200 total stores around the country, which, we felt like, was too many. They, I think, now realize that that's too many. They pulled back on that guidance. They put that 365 store concept on hold to reasses which way they want to go with it. Right now, they're talking about going back to their roots and really focusing on that core Whole Foods customer that helped get them to this point today. It's almost like saying they're going back to that Whole Paychecks moniker. They're going back to targeting that consumer. Honestly, that probably is their best bet. I think we've come to a point where we realize, Whole Foods isn't going to be able to grow as much as a lot of people thought it was going to. So, maybe their best bet is to be that high-end grocer that focuses on a smaller overall market opportunity, but serves that market opportunity in an excellent fashion. And if they do that, it can certainly still perform well, possibly even see margins get back to expanding if they're able to keep on raising those prices a little bit. Because, for the last few years, they really have been focusing on value, to the extent that you would get it even on the grocery bags. If you have your grocery bags from Whole Foods you would see on the bags that they were talking about daily deals and value offerings and all this stuff. They were getting down to having to compete on pricing with all of these other bigger competitors out there. They can't win that game. They're too small to do it. So, then you have to wonder, really, is the path to success here some type of an acquisition? Do they need to acquire something like a Publix to grow that market opportunity and focus on a number of different tiers? Sprouts, a company that just went public shortly ago, a competitor to Whole Foods, sounds like they may be acquired by Albertsons, which also owns Safeway. So, you can certainly see consolidation in this sector. I think Whole Foods is more than likely going to have to either make an acquisition of some sort, or they are really going to be focusing just on that whole paycheck customer, and accepting the fact that they can only become so big. Greer: I'm not saying it would have been a perfect fit, but I think Whole Foods should have gone after Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen. Gross: I knew you were going to say that! That's awesome.

Tennessee Bureau of Investigation releases new photo of Tad Cummins with Elizabeth Thomas at school in January, days before his alleged inappropriate contact with her. Lawyer's office for the family of Elizabeth Thomas released these photos of Elizabeth with dyed hair. She has been missing since March 13, 2017, after a friend dropped her off at a restaurant in Columbia, a city near Culleoka and about 40 miles... By Eric Levenson CNN (CNN) -- The Tennessee teacher and 15-year-old girl who are the subject of a manhunt were spotted at a Walmart in Oklahoma City earlier this month, the first confirmed sighting of the two since officials say the teacher kidnapped the girl. Tad Cummins, 50, is suspected of abducting Elizabeth Thomas, his former student in Maury County, according to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI). "My precious little girl is out there, and we have to bring her home," said Anthony Thomas, the teen's father, in a statement. Elizabeth has been missing since March 13, not long after a student reported she saw the pair kissing, police say. Surveillance images released Friday show Cummins and Elizabeth at a Walmart on East I-240 Service Road in Oklahoma City on the afternoon of March 15. There, Cummins used cash to purchase various food items, according to the TBI. The images show that Cummins has darkened his hair and that Elizabeth may have red hair now. Investigators are working to determine what vehicle they were using. Previous images showed Cummins had brown hair and a gray beard. Thomas says that seeing photos after nearly three weeks without information about Elizabeth's whereabouts brought him "mixed emotions." "It was good to be able to see her face, finally," Thomas said. According to investigators, Cummins has brown eyes and is 6 feet tall and weighs about 200 pounds. Elizabeth has hazel eyes and is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs about 120 pounds. Officials believe Cummins is armed with two handguns and is driving a silver Nissan Rogue with Tennessee plates. Cummins is charged with aggravated kidnapping and sexual misconduct with a minor, and he has been added to the state's "Top 10 Most Wanted" list, the TBI said. Elizabeth was last seen when a friend dropped her off at a restaurant in Columbia, about 40 miles southwest of Nashville. Police believe Cummins picked her up from there and absconded. At the time, Cummins was under investigation for inappropriate kissing with Elizabeth, his former student. The TBI said prior to leaving, she had done "online research on the topic of teen marriage."

Thomas, 15, was last seen when she was dropped off by a friend at the Shoney's in Columbia, TN, on March 13. Cummins, 50, is believed to have kidnapped Thomas. He was fired from his position at Culleoka Unit School after allegations that he had inappropriate conduct with the teenager in a classroom. The pair was captured on surveillance video shopping at the Walmart on East I-240 Service Road in Oklahoma City on March 15. According to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, agents received a tip about the sighting mid-week and obtained the images late Thursday. Cummins reportedly bought several food items, but according to the TBI, did not buy "anything else of significance." These are the first photos of the pair that have been obtained since they both disappeared. Authorities said Cummins appears to have tried to darken his hair. It is not clear what type of vehicle Thomas and Cummins were using around the time of the sighting. Thomas is white with blonde hair and hazel eyes but may have red hair. She is 5’ tall and weighs 120 pounds. She was last seen wearing a flannel shirt and black leggings. Cummins is a white male who is 6’ tall and weighs 200 pounds with brown hair and eyes. He is believed to be armed with two handguns and may be driving a silver Nissan Rogue with Tennessee tag 976ZPT. The TBI has added Cummins to the Top 10 Most Wanted list. He is charged with sexual contact with a minor and aggravated kidnapping. There is a $1,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. Anyone with information on the whereabouts of Thomas or Cummins is asked to call 1-800-TBI-FIND or the Maury County Sheriff’s Department at 931-375-8654.

New images that were captured by a security camera at a Walmart located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma on March 15 show Tad Cummins, 50, and Elizabeth Thomas, 15, stopping in to purchase supplies before quickly heading out of the store. The tape shows that Cummins' has dyed his hair and beard from brown to black while Elizabeth is now a redhead. Both Cummins and Elizabeth wore nondescript clothing on the shopping trip, with the exception of the teenager's large plaid shirt, which actually belongs to her captor. This sighting also reveals that in a span of less than two days Cummins managed to drive 700 miles from Culleoka to Oklahoma City with the teenager. Video that was later released of the visit shows the two in discussion as they enter the store, with the teenager looking upset with the man wanted for her kidnapping.  Scroll down for videos  First glimpse: Tad Cummins and Elizabeth Thomas were spotted at a Walmart in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma on March 15 (above) New look: Thomas is now a redhead (left on March 15), having dyed her hair in the days after she was taken from her home (right before kidnapping)  On their March 15 trip to Walmart the two purchased a few food supplies which Cummins paid for in cash before hitting the road. It is still unclear however what vehicle the two might be driving in, and whether or not either Cummins or Thomas has once again altered their appearance in the days since they were captured in these images.  Investigators had been in possession of the images in their ongoing search for the young girl, and released them to let the public know about how the young captive and her abductor might look.  Authorities now fear that the two may have safely made it to Mexico given how much time has passed since the young girl disappeared on March 13.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next 'I didn't get drunk and kill my kid': Woman who taunted a... Real life Mean Girls spark chaos at California school:... Share this article Share On Friday, an attorney for Cummins' wife Jill revealed in a statement that she had filed for divorce. 'Today Jill Walters Cummins filed for divorce from Tad Cummins, her husband of 31 years. The filing of the divorce complaint is the first step to removing Jill from this situation. Jill will attempt to move forward with her life. This is a difficult time for her and her family,' read the statement. 'She would appreciate the media and the public respecting her need for privacy during these trying times. 'Jill continues to pray for the safe return of Elizabeth Thomas and for a peaceful resolution to this ordeal.' Path from home: A look at the first two days following the disappearance of Elizabeth (above) Changing it up: Cummins, 50, dyed his hair and beard from brown to black the day after he disappeared with the student (left on march 15, right prior to kidnapping)  Together: The pair were captured on a security camera at the retail store, which is located 700 miles from Thomas' home in Culleoka, Tennessee Cummins was last seen one day before the two disappeared buying hair dye at a Walmart, while wearing the plaid shirt that Elizabeth was seen in days later in Oklahoma. At the time is was assumed that this would be used to alter Elizabeth's appearance after he snatched the teenager, but it is now clear that is not the case. It was instead Cummins who was using the hair dye, making it unclear when Elizabeth changed her look.  Elizabeth, who is one of ten children, made frequent posts on social media about romance and love in the weeks before she was abducted by Cummins. She also started calling herself 'wife' on Instagram and made several references to a 'mission' that was 'almost complete'. On March 13, she told family she was going to spend the day with a friend. One of her siblings has since revealed that the teenager told them to call police if she did not return home that night. Authorities believe she may have gone willingly with Cummins, who they say has been grooming her for sex for some time. Elizabeth was seen on surveillance footage the day she disappeared carrying a bundle of clothes. The grandfather is believed to be armed and possible dangerous, with two guns. Elizabeth's mother spoke to DailyMail.com last week in an exclusive interview to share her fears about her daughter's abduction. She labeled her daughter's captor as 'disturbed' and said she worried Elizabeth would either end up pregnant or dead. Previous spotting: Cummins was again at a Walmart on March 12, one day before the disappearance, purchasing hair dye (above) Shut it down: Cummins' wife Jill filed for divorce from her husband  an attorney revealed on Friday The sister of Elizabeth Thomas also spoke about the abduction on Good Morning America earlier this week. The young girl fought back tears as she revealed that Cummins had begun showing up unannounced at her sister's work shortly before the pair disappeared together, and that his last visit had come just two days before the girl's abduction. 'She would go and tell people to tell him she wasn't there and she would go and hide until he left,' explained Sarah Thomas. 'She thought it was the only way. She felt uncomfortable.' Elizabeth's family is still holding out hope that they will see the girl again, and are begging any person who might have information to reach out and contact authorities. 'It feels like she just vanished, and I know that's impossible, someone had to see her,' said the victim's sister Sarah. Her father meanwhile was optimistic about the teenager's eventual return home to be with her family. 'We just live for that day where we are gonna get a phone call that says we're alright and waiting for someone to get me,' said Anthony Thomas. Shocking revelation: The sister (Sarah above) of the missing Tennessee teenager said that Tad had been showing up at her work unannounced Bereaved: She would go and tell people to tell him she wasn't there and she would go and hide until he left,' said Sarah Thomas (Thomas family above) Investigators have also learned that the two had been sending love letters to one another which were at times sexually charged by writing draft emails on a shared classroom computer at Culleoka School.  They spent last weekend pouring over email drafts that the two would send one another while in school for any clues into where the pair may be, with Cummins now facing charges of aggravated kidnapping and sexual contact with a minor. Those letters were all sent after a student witnessed Cummins and Elizabeth kissing in his classroom this past January.  'They would write the message and let it save as a draft. The other person would log in, read the message and then delete it and then write another message that was saved as a draft,' said Maury County District Attorney Brent Cooper. 'If you read them you would immediately recognize you are reading messages between two people who have a romantic interest in each other.' One of the emails uncovered by authorities was written by Cummins and began: 'I saw you standing next to your backpack this morning.' The teacher then told the student how nice one of her body parts looked to him in the note.   The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, which is leading the hunt for the pair, has received hundreds of tips but none have led to Elizabeth's discovery and safe return. One reported sighting of the pair was made in Corpus Christi, a coastal city in south east Texas, two weeks ago. They were reported to have been seen in the tiny town of North Beach which sits just 160 miles from the Mexican border. Nothing ever came of the tip-off and police have not clarified whether they believe it was credible or a case of mistaken identity.  There have been 1,200 tips in the case as of Friday morning, and a reward of $10,000 now being offered for the safe return of Elizabeth by one of Tad's former co-workers.

Now, they're being billed for it Flint is invoicing people for lead-contaminated water. Says one: “We just don’t want to pay to have ourselves killed.” Ronda Thornton outside her house in a deteriorating neighbourhood of Flint, Mich. She is facing the threat of a water shutoff.   (Daniel Dale / Toronto Star) | Order this photo   By Daniel Dale Washington Bureau Fri., March 31, 2017 FLINT, MICH.—A day off in Flint. William Miller got his hair cut and his van fixed up. Then he needed something to drink, so he did what people here do, still, three years into this fiasco. He drove to the parking lot beside the boarded-up bowling alley that says “ESTAURANT” on the side. He stopped at the four stop signs. He gave his address and his order to a woman holding a clipboard and wearing a fluorescent yellow vest. “Twelve!” LaKrisha Shumon shouted ahead, and Miller, a 49-year-old surgical assistant who also owns a medical transport business, crept forward so that the men in vests could load the van with 12 free cases of Walmart’s Great Value Purified Drinking Water. He comes every week. His anger has not subsided. “It’s disgusting,” Miller, a trim man with a goatee and a grey college sweatshirt, said in an interview out his car window. “I should not have to do this. I’m a middle-class person. This is not the way life is supposed to be in this country. It’s morally reprehensible.” Article Continued Below He could, in theory, just turn on his tap. Eight months after Republican Gov. Rick Snyder belatedly acknowledged a problem with Flint’s water, Snyder officials told residents in June that their water was safe to drink with a filter. Not happening. These same state departments also told Flint residents their water was fine when it was actually poison. Their trust in government is gone now, maybe forever. And while lead levels have fallen below the federal danger threshold, residents know now that no amount of lead is truly safe, they know the city’s work on its pipes poses new contamination risks, and they say the water is still foul-smelling and still making them sick. So they show up at the Eastown Bowl and Flint’s eight other drive-thru distribution sites six days a week, forming water lines rarely seen outside the world’s poorest and most parched nations. Some of them won’t even do that. Occupational therapist Audrey Muhammad buys her own bottled water, and only in the suburbs. She is suspicious of anything run by the state and city authorities. “It’s kind of like: I’m going to stab you, but I’m going to give you the surgery to repair the wound,” said Muhammad, 51, a woman with a hijab and a broad smile, at a recent benefit concert. “How can you trust that the person that stabs you is going to take care of the wound the proper way?” Twelve people in the Flint area died from a legionnaires’ disease outbreak after the city and state made the disastrous decision to use the Flint River as its water source. Thousands of Flint children were exposed to lead. The damage to them will reveal itself slowly, over decades, as the neurotoxin affects their health, behaviour and ability to learn and earn. The network cameras have mostly gone now, off to cover faster-moving disasters. But even the short-term crisis has not come close to passing. Many Flint residents are still getting their water from drive-through sites around the city. They do not trust the tap water, even with filters, though it has been declared safe.   (Daniel Dale/TORONTO STAR)   A full year after the water became an international scandal, Flint is a city fearful, fatigued and furious: terrified of the unknowable harm to come, worn down by years of fighting, enraged by what they see as the continued failure of government to support them. A flurry of recent good-news announcements, of tens of millions of dollars in coming investment, have not changed the widespread perception that this poor, majority-black city has been abandoned again. “We wear the shirts that say Flint Lives Matter, but we’re like — they matter to us, but other than that, not at all,” said Melissa Mays, 38, the city’s most prominent citizen water activist. “We are getting worse, we’re not getting better, and we literally scream this, but Trump trumps us in the media.” The pediatrician who exposed the spike in local children’s blood-lead levels is more optimistic. Mona Hanna-Attisha said “so many awesome things are happening,” pointing to government and philanthropic programs for the young. But she too said “we’re still very much in this crisis.” “People are angry and traumatized, and there’s a lot more work to do,” she said. “The biggest part of this crisis is that trauma, that stress, that betrayal, that anxiety, that guilt. The mental health issue is the biggest one.” At the moment, Hanna-Attisha said, “everybody’s blaming everything on the water,” from learning disabilities to early-onset dementia. In her clinic, she spends a significant chunk of time trying to assure parents that their children are not doomed, that homework and hugs can improve their trajectory. “It’s like I’m writing prescriptions for hope,” she said. In March, some Flint residents starting getting threats to cut off water for unpaid bills — bills for water contaminated with lead.   (Daniel Dale/TORONTO STAR)   The warning letters arrived in Flint mailboxes in early March. Their demand, of almost unfathomable audacity, is delivered in red capital letters, underlined for emphasis: pay for your poison or else. Snyder’s government, which was largely responsible for the water disaster, announced in February that it would stop giving Flint residents subsidies for their water. Mayor Karen Weaver then decided to resume the practice of shutting off the water for people with unpaid bills. Coercive water shut-offs are controversial in the U.S. under normal circumstances, castigated by the United Nations as a violation of human rights. In Flint, which charged people some of the highest water rates in the country for killer gunk, the threats have been greeted with a mix of astonishment and told-you-so resignation. “The people in Flint should not have to pay for water for at least a decade,” Hanna-Attisha said. Thousands of residents have been refusing to pay for a year or more. Some say they will continue the protest even though parents without running water are regularly investigated by child protection authorities. “I’m not going to give them one penny,” said Nakiya Wakes, 41, a stay-at-home-mom-turned-activist who owes $822.62. She had two miscarriages before the authorities warned pregnant women not to drink Flint water, and she believes the lead is also responsible for the worsening behaviour of her 8-year-old son, who has been suspended from school dozens of times. Mays, a combative woman with a jagged sense of humour and little regard for social niceties, said she will try come up with an “insane” solution, like rigging up a cistern for an outdoor shower, rather than relent. “Everyone says, ‘You guys just want something for free.’ No, we just don’t want to pay to have ourselves killed,” Mays, 38, said over her usual snack of coffee and pickles at a Flint bookstore-cafe. “I’m not going to pay a hit man to kill me.” Four days later, a judge approved a settlement in a lawsuit filed by Mays and several advocacy groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union. Snyder’s government agreed to spend $87 million to replace at least 18,000 of Flint’s lead and galvanized-steel water lines by 2020. The activists hailed the agreement. But the need for a lawsuit to speed up the glacial process of fixing Flint’s deadly infrastructure has galled a city already steaming over what is widely seen as a lack of accountability for the calamity. These days, the dissatisfaction is often expressed in Facebook rants and quiet conversations between friends. The length of the crisis has sapped public enthusiasm for street protests and pressure calls to legislators. “The longer that it goes on, the less people that are getting into it,” said LuLu Brezzell, 27, a photographer. “How would you feel if you were ignored for years and nothing has been done? How would you feel? A lot of people don’t really have the will to keep fighting.” Last year, more charges have been filed by the Michigan attorney general investigating the lead-tainted crisis in Flint, Michigan, including charges against two former state-appointed emergency managers.(The Associated Press ) The state attorney general has laid charges against 13 people, including felony charges against two of the former Snyder-appointed “emergency managers” who presided over the fatal decision to switch from Lake Huron water to save money. Snyder himself, though, has not been charged — and he has spent more than $3.5 million of taxpayer money on criminal lawyers for himself. “Someone should be in jail at this point. Because the magnitude of this calamity and the coverup — no one’s in jail. That’s atrocious. And everything that went on in the city, the governor knew about,” Miller said, expressing a common though unproven sentiment. “Mr. Governor: fess up.” Open mic night at Totem Books, the funky store where Mays is known as “pickles and coffee lady.” A young, multiracial crowd of about 45 gathered to listen to a white woman sing about Jesus, a black woman recite a poem about her sex life, a white man tell bad jokes. One of them was about outsiders asking ignorant questions about the water. “It’s not that you want to try to get away with strangling somebody,” the amateur comic said, “it’s the frequency at which you think about it.” At the same time as the people of Flint decry the fading attention to their water problems, they lament that they are now known for little else. This is a vibrant community, they say, creative, resilient and unusually tight-knit, a post-industrial survivor primed for yet another comeback. But the water still looms over everything, even the hip hangouts. And even the optimism about Flint’s future is tinged with concern. Of all the programs that have been launched in the past two years to help Flint — expanded access to preschool, Medicaid health coverage for young people, kids’ “nutrition prescriptions” for fresh fruits and vegetables — few are sure to be funded beyond the next few years. “This is not a two- to three-year recovery,” said Hanna-Attisha. “The commitments and the resources are not there for the long-term.” William Miller, 49, picking up his weekly allotment of free bottled water in Flint. "This is not the way life is supposed to be in this country," he said. "It’s morally reprehensible.”   (Daniel Dale/Toronto Star)   Much of the city already feels shortchanged. Children under the age of 6, who are most susceptible to the impact of lead, have been the overwhelming focus of the aid programs. Adults, though, have suffered too. There has been little assistance for them other than the water subsidies. Ronda Thornton stood outside her house last Saturday afternoon. Next door was “the hooker house” once occupied by a sex worker, now derelict. Beside that was a derelict food market. The sidewalk was cracked. The only sign of life was the traffic across the road, coming and going from one of Flint’s ubiquitous liquor stores. Thornton, a chatty 51-year-old with a hard face betraying her rough life, fell seriously ill before she learned the water was unsafe, drinking more and more water to try to “flush out” whatever was wrong with her, dropping from 112 pounds to 88 pounds. Now she uses buckets to deal with the holes in the roof, and her food stamps, $77 a month, aren’t enough to keep her fed. “I’m disabled, my husband’s disabled,” she said. “We can’t even get no help because we don’t have kids in our home. It’s like, what do they expect us to do, just drop dead?” The government did acknowledge her existence on March 2. She got a letter telling her to pay her overdue water bill of more than $240. “The health of our community,” the city explained, “is dependent on getting payments from our customers.” Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

An EPD investigator said the body had been identified as that of Carolyn Pleasant, 60. According to a news release by Capt. Joy Shoun, chief of the Criminal Investigations Division for the Elizabethton Police Department, the body was discovered when police officers conducted a welfare check at 9:30 p.m. on March 25. The news release reported that at that time the woman inside the parked car “was determined to be deceased.” An autopsy was ordered, and no foul play was suspected in the death. “From the investigation, we have been able to determine that Ms. Pleasant’s vehicle had been at that location for several weeks, and during that time she had passed away,” Shoun said in a news release. “There was no evidence of foul play observed on the scene. Preliminary findings from the autopsy also indicate a lack of trauma and no indicators of foul play. The final autopsy results are still pending.” Police had initially withheld the woman’s name, saying they were awaiting positive identification and next-of-kin notifications before releasing her name or other information.

Two of them, Alicia Stokes and Ruby McFarland, spoke with Georgia Burton, the county Extension agent, who ended up being a tremendous help in starting a guild and organizing a quilt show. Word went out into the community to gauge interest, and more than 40 ladies showed up at a meeting to discuss the guild. At that first meeting, the women outlined the goals they wanted to accomplish through their work together. They decided to teach quilting, make a quilt each year, sell raffle tickets on the quilt, and use the money to support a community need. They also wanted to produce a Class A quilt show. A second meeting was held to officially establish the guild, and the 22 women attending paid a $6 membership fee. With other obligations that day, Stokes wasn’t able to attend that particular meeting, and so—as often happens—she was appointed guild president. A public contest determined the name of the guild, with the winning submission being Contented Heart Quilt Guild. The name was submitted by a lady in her 90s who, when asked why she continued to quilt, responded that it gave her a contented heart.  With an enthusiastic beginning, the guild got busy. Members met in the basement of the Wayne County Public Library, made quilts and raffled tickets to raise money. The first-year quilt was sold to provide wood for fuel for a needy family, and the next year bought coal for another family. By the third year, Wal-Mart had started a program in which needy families could place the name and age of a child on a star, along with what the child needed. Shoppers then could use these stars to purchase items for the kids. The Contented Heart members made a quilt, raffled it for $300, and sent a delegate to Wal-Mart to buy items for the children whose names were on the stars.  The guild always took a summer trip to a fabric store in another community and to enjoy a picnic together.  In 1993, the Contented Heart Quilt Guild decided to start a quilt show. As president, Stokes went to the founder of the National Quilt Museum in Paducah for guidance. “Mrs. [Meredith] Schroeder [president of the American Quilter’s Society] told me to start with something that is already going on, set the date and don’t change it,” Stokes said. “She also told us to keep the price affordable, handle the quilts professionally, rope them off, and wear white gloves when handling the quilts. “We followed her instructions, and as Monticello already hosted a well-attended Labor Day event each year, we decided to coincide with it. We set the date, location [the National Guard Armory] and price, and stuck with it. We sought sponsors and donations from businesses and organizations in town to help us build quilt frames and what we needed was provided. It was a real community effort.” Contented Heart’s first show was considered a huge success. The guild displayed 93 quilts and hosted more than 300 people. “After our third show, the public library where we’d always met was running out of room for us,” Stokes said. “And we needed to find a new location to meet. My husband told me about a historic building in downtown Monticello that was for sale. I laughed at him and told him the guild had all of $240 in our checking account.”  But her husband wasn’t about to let the building go. He reminded his wife of something they’d heard on the news. It was 1996, an election year, and then-First Lady Hillary Clinton had talked about wanting to help women’s groups that wanted to help themselves. “He suggested that I call the White House, ask for Mrs. Clinton and mention that I’m a member of a 30-member guild, and that there is a building for sale downtown we want to buy,” Stokes recalled.  She made the call and was put through to Susan, Mrs. Clinton’s personal assistant. “I explained what we were doing and asked if there was any way we could get a grant so we could purchase the building and have a permanent place to meet. Susan said she’d take it to Mrs. Clinton, and promised to get back to me. Believe it or not, she did, about a week later.” Susan said the first lady was excited about the idea and that her office would research what grants might be available and would be back in touch. “They called me every week and eventually told me that the best option would be through the Kentucky Appalachian Regional Commission,” Stokes said. “The White House offered to call ARC and see if they would write the grant on our behalf. “While we were waiting, I happened to think about Hal Rogers being from our community and thought perhaps he might be able to help. I got hold of his people and explained what we were doing, working with the White House. The staff offered to work on it and get back to me, and I ended up meeting twice with Mr. Rogers, and later with Mitch McConnell. I wanted everyone to understand that we had both Democrats and Republicans in our guild, and we wanted help from both sides.”  Eventually, the guild worked with the Kentucky Heritage Council and its grant support came through from ARC, enabling the group to purchase the building. “I called the members and everyone went crazy,” Stokes said. “We met over at the building to celebrate. That year, we raised $60,000 in grants and matching funds. Not bad for this small town and a bunch of little old ladies.”  After purchasing the building, the guild decided to rent out portions of it to local artisans to sell their goods on consignment. In 2004, Anneda Guffey, then guild president, moved the quilt show to the Aspire Center, where it continues to be held on the Friday and Saturday of Labor Day weekend. And during Guffey’s presidency, the group applied for a $30,000 matching grant from ARC to have the building’s roof replaced and a wheelchair ramp added to the back of the building. “In 2010, our president, Polly Sartin, and her husband, Ronald, worked through our local museum and detention center program to use Class D felons for free labor,” Stokes said. “We began raising money again to renovate the upstairs of the building. There were four inmates per day, and we really lucked out. One happened to be a carpenter and cabinetmaker, and there was a dry waller and a licensed brick layer, painter, electrician and plumber.  “Several husbands helped, along with about 10 members of the guild. Guild members provided a meal for the inmates five days a week. The inmates were so proud of the work they were doing and made suggestions along the way, such as installing a restroom and a kitchen. With their free labor, we pooled our resources and decided to do the whole renovation ourselves.” When asked what she’d tell other groups considering the same kind of initiative, Stokes said, “Pick out what you’re going to do that is worthwhile for the community. Go to people in town; explain the idea in detail. People will want to help you. Don’t underestimate yourself; have a good plan—not frivolous. Don’t give up, and keep going after it.”  Illustrations By Jessica Patton Tags Kentucky Quilts by Bobbie Smith Bryant RSS Print Saturday April 1, 2017 Kids & Family The Hunger Games:The Exhibition Apr 1, 2017 - Sep 9, 2017 Frazier History Museum Outdoor Flora, Fauna and Forestry Fun at Old Mulkey Meetinghouse Apr 1, 2017 7:00 AM - 5:00 PM Old Mulkey Meetinghouse State Historic Site This & That Spring Rejuvenation for Writers Apr 1, 2017 8:30 AM - 4:30 PM Purdue Research Park Sunday April 2, 2017 Home & Garden Outdoor Arbor Day Adopt-a-Tree Apr 2, 2017 9:00 AM - 4:00 PM Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest Markets Preservation Station April Market Days Apr 2, 2017 10:00 AM - 5:00 PM Preservation Station Market and Event Center Home & Garden Central Kentucky Home & Garden Show Apr 2, 2017 11:00 AM - 5:00 PM Lexington Center Monday April 3, 2017 Kids & Family Outdoor Spring Break Adventure Week at Bernheim Apr 3, 2017 11:00 AM - 3:00 PM Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest Kids & Family The Hunger Games:The Exhibition Apr 1, 2017 - Sep 9, 2017 Frazier History Museum Concerts & Live Music Louisville Opera's Sidecar at the Mercury Ballroom Mar 31, 2017 - May 19, 2017 Mercury Ballroom Tuesday April 4, 2017 Kids & Family Outdoor Spring Break Adventure Week at Bernheim Apr 4, 2017 11:00 AM - 3:00 PM Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest Concerts & Live Music Dirty Dancing - The Classic Story On Stage Apr 4, 2017 7:30 PM - 11:30 PM EKU Center for the Arts Kids & Family The Hunger Games:The Exhibition Apr 1, 2017 - Sep 9, 2017 Frazier History Museum Wednesday April 5, 2017 Kids & Family Outdoor Spring Break Adventure Week at Bernheim Apr 5, 2017 11:00 AM - 3:00 PM Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest Kids & Family Outdoor Nature Concert at Bernheim Apr 5, 2017 1:00 PM - 1:45 PM Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest Food & Drink Talks & Readings Distilling Traditions- Chris Morris at Locust Grove Apr 5, 2017 1:15 PM - 3:00 PM Locust Grove Thursday April 6, 2017 Kids & Family Outdoor Spring Break Adventure Week at Bernheim Apr 6, 2017 11:00 AM - 3:00 PM Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest Education & Learning Talks & Readings 2017 Grawemeyer Awards Lecture Series Apr 6, 2017 3:00 PM - 4:00 PM University of Louisville Education & Learning Talks & Readings Monasteries and harbors: Talks enlighten about archaeology finds Apr 6, 2017 6:00 PM - 7:00 PM University of Louisville Ekstrom Library Friday April 7, 2017 Theater & Dance Crimes of the Heart at Hardin County Playhouse Apr 7, 2017 12:00 AM Hardin County Playhouse Kids & Family Sports Keeneland Race Course Thoroughbred Racing Apr 7, 2017 12:00 AM - 11:00 PM Keeneland Race Course Theater & Dance Disenchanted at The Carnegie Apr 7, 2017 - Apr 8, 2017 The Carnegie Visual and Performing Arts Center Search Events Submit Yours EXPLORE 24 Hours Places Field Notes FOOD Featured Recipes 120 Eats LIFESTYLE Featured Home Education Gardening Health EVENTS CULTURE People History Arts & Entertainment Music Books Extra Vested Interest SHOP MAGAZINE In This Issue Advertise Subscribe Submit KY Kwiz Our Partners People History Arts & Entertainment Music Books Extra Vested Interest Advertise About Us Contact Us Free Trial Change Address FAQ Submit an Event Subscribe Vested Interest Publications, Inc. | P.O.

Share on Facebook A A Report an Error Share via Email Print Contributed/RCMP Police say replica handguns like these are so realistic that they have to treat them like the real thing. By: Staff Metro Halifax Published on Police in Nova Scotia are remdinding people about the dangers of replica weapons after a man was arrested at a Wal-Mart this week with two replica handguns. A release from Nova Scotia RCMP says they got a 911 call about a man with guns and knives in the Wal-Mart in Cookville, near Bridgewater, at 11:30 Thursday morning. Officers went to the store and arrested an 18-year-old man, and found two replica handguns and two knives. In the release, Sgt. Mark MacPherson says incidents like this one are troubling because the replica guns look so realistic, “and our officers are required to make decisions when responding in fractions of a second.” "In instances like this, we have to treat them as real weapons,” he said. The 18-year-old man, who police don’t name but say is from Brier Island, was released on the condition that he appear in Bridgewater provincial court on May 3 to face a charge of possession of a dangerous weapon.

In Wake of Hacking Attacks, Cyber Security Keynote Speaker to Share Risk Management Best Practices with CEOs, Directors and Investors in Singapore, London and New York City 2017-03-30 Print Tweet   Edgar Perez, author of Knightmare on Wall Street and The Speed Traders, partnering with Terrapinn Training to bring key information security insights for CEOs, board members and investors who need to become more educated about cyber security today FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE As cyberattacks become more common, organizations of all types are increasingly investing in cyber security awareness and protection. However, even with the best protection systems in place, determined hackers can still break into a companys network if employees and partners arent also being diligent about cybersecurity. Cyber criminals have become much better at disguising malicious email to make it look more legitimate; that is how John Podestas communications were compromised. So employees need to be vigilant and ask questions about all of the email they receive that raises even the slightest suspicion, which is most likely not what happened at some of the high-profile cyber security breaches that have been in the headlines lately: Adobe, E*Trade, Fidelity, Home Depot, Neiman Marcus, Sony, Target and Wal-mart. As information technology becomes ever more complex and Internet usage increasingly widespread, cybersecurity is becoming an increasingly important and business-critical field. Are you and your organization effectively prepared to handle cybersecurity threats? Do you know how to identify threats, address challenges and apply a cybersecurity framework? Participants at Terrapinn Trainings 3-Day Masterclass Cybersecurity with Edgar Perez will:  Gain a comprehensive understanding of cybersecurity and its key aspects  Get to grips with various cybersecurity testing methods  Learn valuable system administration techniques for executives  Master the cybersecurity framework and its five core functions  Discover how to establish or improve your cybersecurity program  Consider how the weak human link can become the organizations greatest strength  Understand the four components of the cyber preparedness continuum Edgar Perez, author of The Speed Traders and Knightmare on Wall Street, is a recognized global keynote speaker and director of programs targeted at board members, chief executive officers and senior executives looking for new ways to gain and maintain a competitive business advantage. SPEAKERS KEYNOTE TOPICS · Establishing or Improving a Cybersecurity Program The NIST Cybersecurity Framework, which was drafted by the Commerce Departments National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), comprises leading practices from various standards bodies that have proved to be successful when implemented, and it also may deliver regulatory and legal advantages that extend well beyond improved cybersecurity for organizations that adopt it early. Its adoption may prove advantageous for businesses across virtually all industries. Mr. Perez will explain why a proper Cybersecurity Program will build on the analysis of the possible areas of concern, an understanding of the companys most critical assets, and a thorough review of Information Technologys policies and procedures when faced with cybercrime. · The Importance of the Cybersecurity Framework for Directors and CEOs An email embedded with malware. Security systems hacked by thieves. Credit card numbers stolen from store purchases. Theres certainly no shortage of examples when it comes to data security breaches and the havoc they wreak on business. No wonder then that nearly a third of CEOs in KPMGs latest global survey identified cyber security as the issue having the biggest impact on their companies today. Every organization should apply a Cybersecurity Framework for analyzing cyber security, and ideally it should be integrated into an organizations existing enterprise risk framework. The key is making it part of the mainstream of risk management within an organization. The most innovative companies today have recognized that cyber security is a customer experience and revenue opportunity, not just a risk that needs to be managed. Mr. Perez will explain why this must done across the entire organization and why the CEO and Board of Directors have the most important role to play. · The Impact of Brexit in the U.K and the World Companies inside and outside Britains borders have warned that the Brexit decision is affecting their businesses, highlighting how the June vote for the UK to leave the European Union is having wide repercussions. The vote roiled equity markets worldwide and led to a devaluation of sterling amid concerns over a prolonged slowdown in consumer demand. The U.K.s decision to leave the European Union inflicted an immediate blow on the economy as business activity shrank at its fastest pace since the last recession seven years ago. The International Monetary Fund said that it had become less optimistic on global growth, and warned the damage could worsen if confidence falters among investors and companies, as fears abound over businesses and customers reining in spending during a period of uncertainty for the UK as it negotiates the terms of its exit. Mr. Perez will identify the world economies that will feel the lions share of the short and long-term pain to come. · The Biggest Risks for Financial Markets Constant regulatory changes and technological evolution have transformed the financial landscape so profoundly since the advent of the first electronic networks in the early 1970s. Regulators around the world are now in a race to respond to the evolution of technology in financial markets and prevent its operational challenges from becoming the biggest risk for financial markets. However, when considering technology and the cyber landscape, errors are bound to happen. Financial services firms are expected to have deployed the most sophisticated defense systems against cyberattacks. Trading firms are expected to have controls in place and invest in the technology to keep up to date. Most companies would realize the need of these investments and honestly attempt to implement them, but their IT departments would soon hit a wall, because of direct involvement from senior management and boards of directors. Compliance actions against those who missed their importance will go a long way toward restoring investor confidence and limiting the impact of the biggest risk for financial markets. · Finance in the New Global Economy Until quite recently, globalization was seen as a one-way street. Multinationals, which led the charge four decades or so ago into growing global markets, were its ambassadors, and American and European workers, whose wages and upward mobility were flattened, were feeling left out. The core idea was that globalization, technological innovation and unfettered free trade would erase historical and geographic boundaries, making the world ever more economically interconnected and alike. Developed economies would come under more and more competitive pressure from eager upstart nations. Now we are entering a new age of volatility. Financiers will become less important, manufacturers more so. Blue collar jobs will go high tech. Robots will replace Chinese workers. Mr. Perez will discuss why finance stands now in front of its biggest transformation triggered not by any of the financial conglomerates that dominate the world today but by obscure startups that could be working already in garages in Silicon Valley, Shanghai, Kiev or Delhi. · Blockchain and its impact on Finance Blockchain technology (the software behind the digital currency, Bitcoin) offers an opportunity to overhaul existing business models, including banking infrastructure, approach to settlements and customer interactions. Now it is only a matter of time before the broader financial services and banking industries shift to blockchain and network-based approaches. The application possibilities are endless, improving the way we hold and transfer secure goods from money to deeds to music to intellectual property. In fact, blockchain, as a pure platform technology, may be able to cut out the middlemen (or middle companies) everywhere, even disrupting other disruptors like Airbnb or Uber. Mr. Perez will explain why the question is not whether network business models supported by blockchain technology will disrupt organizations, but when. · China: To Rebalance or Not to Rebalance Chinas 12th Five-Year Guideline in 2011 included efforts to rebalance its economy, shifting emphasis from investment towards consumption and development from urban and coastal areas toward rural and inland areas. Flash forward to 2016 and the country is exhibiting massive overcapacity in sectors linked to real estate, steel, cement, coal and construction equipment, zombie businesses continue to undermine the sustainability of Chinas growth and exports are declining. At 260% of gross domestic product, the countrys overall debt is approaching danger levels. The world's second-largest economy is now posting its weakest annual growth in 25 years, 6.9% for 2015. To top it all, $676 billion left China in 2015; with so much overcapacity in China, lack of confidence in the future as monetary policy can change tomorrow, why should people keep money inside China? Why should we bet on China? Mr. Perez will bring the answers you are looking for. · Social Engineering: The Weakest Human Link in Cybersecurity Social engineering involves tricking your employees into breaching security protocols or giving away information, most often over the telephone or via email. Social engineering exploits human weaknesses rather than technology, preying upon peoples propensity towards trust in particular. Often, these exploits are used to gather information to support a more targeted cyberattack, with the initial forays based on the premise of little and often so as not to cause concern. Employees at all levels, including senior executives, are vulnerable. Mr. Perez will explain why by improving employee awareness and introducing simple technical measures, organizations can protect themselves against social engineering techniques and the risk of a cyberattack and its potential impact on business, customers and data. · The Present and Future of High-Frequency Trading On May 6, 2010, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted nearly 1,000 points, then its biggest intraday point drop ever. The Flash Crash revealed the influence of high-frequency trading to mainstream audiences around the world. In fact, over the past 15 years, the global financial market has fragmented: where there were once three main U.S. exchanges, there are now more than 40 exchanges and alternative trading systems. High-frequency trading companies have largely replaced traditional broker-dealers, using algorithms instead of human traders to make decisions in milliseconds, mostly in response to orders made by other algorithms. Mr. Perez will discuss the benefits brought by technology, making trading faster and more efficient, as well as the potential costs brought upon institutional and retail investors. ABOUT KNIGHTMARE ON WALL STREET Knightmare on Wall Street, The Rise and Fall of Knight Capital and the Biggest Risk for Financial Markets, provides a fascinating account of what it took to elevate the firm to the cusp of the retail investing revolution of the late 1990s, to struggle through booms and busts, and to bring the firm down, to end up ultimately being ignominiously bought up by a competitor. Knight Capital announced a staggering loss of $440 million. What followed after this shocking announcement were several rounds of desperate conversations with a number of vulture players who had smelled opportunity and were readying themselves to pick up bargain-priced pieces. On August 6, 2012, Joyce confirmed that Knight Capital had struck a deal with Jefferies, TD Ameritrade, Blackstone, GETCO, Stephens, and Stifel Financial, staving off collapse days after the trading mishap. Knightmare on Wall Street, is a thrilling minute-by-minute account of the terrifying hours following Knight Capitals August 1, 2012 trading debacle, with news-breaking research regarding the firms 17 years of tumultuous existence as an independent company. Knightmare on Wall Street is the definitive behind-the-scenes story of Knight Capital. ABOUT THE SPEED TRADERS High-frequency traders have been called many thingsfrom masters of the universe and market pioneers to exploiters, computer geeks, and even predators. Everyone in the business of investing has an opinion of speed traders, but how many really understand how they operate? The shadow people of the investing world, todays high-frequency traders have decidedly kept a low profileuntil now. In this title, The Speed Traders, Mr. Perez opens the door to the secretive world of high-frequency trading (HFT). Inside, prominent figures of HFT drop their guard and speak with unprecedented candidness about their trade. Mr. Perez begins with an overview of computerized trading, which formally began on February 8, 1971, when NASDAQ launched the worlds first electronic market with 2,500 over-the-counter stocks and which has evolved into the present-day practice of making multiple trades in a matter of microseconds. He then picks the brains of todays top players. John Netto (M3 Capital), Manoj Narang (Tradeworx), and Aaron Lebovitz (Infinium Capital Management) are just a few of the luminaries who decided to break their silence and speak openly to Mr. Perez. Virtually all of the expertise available from the world of speed trading is packed into these pages. The Speed Traders, published by McGraw-Hill, is the most comprehensive, revealing work available on the most important development in trading in generations.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 31 March 2017 by Military News In Wake of Hacking Attacks, Cyber Security Keynote Speaker to Share Risk Management Best Practices with CEOs, Directors and Investors in Singapore, London and New York City Edgar Perez, author of Knightmare on Wall Street and The Speed Traders, partnering with Terrapinn Training to bring key information security insights for CEOs, board members and investors who need to become more educated about cyber security today FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE As cyberattacks become more common, organizations of all types are increasingly investing in cyber security awareness and protection. However, even with the best protection systems in place, determined hackers can still break into a company’s network if employees and partners aren’t also being diligent about cybersecurity. Cyber criminals have become much better at disguising malicious email to make it look more legitimate; that is how John Podesta’s communications were compromised. So employees need to be vigilant and ask questions about all of the email they receive that raises even the slightest suspicion, which is most likely not what happened at some of the high-profile cyber security breaches that have been in the headlines lately: Adobe, E*Trade, Fidelity, Home Depot, Neiman Marcus, Sony, Target and Wal-mart. As information technology becomes ever more complex and Internet usage increasingly widespread, cybersecurity is becoming an increasingly important and business-critical field. Are you and your organization effectively prepared to handle cybersecurity threats? Do you know how to identify threats, address challenges and apply a cybersecurity framework? Participants at Terrapinn Training’s 3-Day Masterclass Cybersecurity with Edgar Perez will: • Gain a comprehensive understanding of cybersecurity and its key aspects • Get to grips with various cybersecurity testing methods • Learn valuable system administration techniques for executives • Master the cybersecurity framework and its five core functions • Discover how to establish or improve your cybersecurity program • Consider how the “weak human link” can become the organization’s greatest strength • Understand the four components of the cyber preparedness continuum Edgar Perez, author of The Speed Traders and Knightmare on Wall Street, is a recognized global keynote speaker and director of programs targeted at board members, chief executive officers and senior executives looking for new ways to gain and maintain a competitive business advantage. SPEAKER’S KEYNOTE TOPICS · Establishing or Improving a Cybersecurity Program The NIST Cybersecurity Framework, which was drafted by the Commerce Department’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), comprises leading practices from various standards bodies that have proved to be successful when implemented, and it also may deliver regulatory and legal advantages that extend well beyond improved cybersecurity for organizations that adopt it early. Its adoption may prove advantageous for businesses across virtually all industries. Mr. Perez will explain why a proper Cybersecurity Program will build on the analysis of the possible areas of concern, an understanding of the company’s most critical assets, and a thorough review of Information Technology’s policies and procedures when faced with cybercrime. · The Importance of the Cybersecurity Framework for Directors and CEOs An email embedded with malware. Security systems hacked by thieves. Credit card numbers stolen from store purchases. There’s certainly no shortage of examples when it comes to data security breaches and the havoc they wreak on business. No wonder then that nearly a third of CEOs in KPMG’s latest global survey identified cyber security as the issue having the biggest impact on their companies today. Every organization should apply a Cybersecurity Framework for analyzing cyber security, and ideally it should be integrated into an organization’s existing enterprise risk framework. The key is making it part of the mainstream of risk management within an organization. The most innovative companies today have recognized that cyber security is a customer experience and revenue opportunity, not just a risk that needs to be managed. Mr. Perez will explain why this must done across the entire organization and why the CEO and Board of Directors have the most important role to play. · The Impact of Brexit in the U.K and the World Companies inside and outside Britain’s borders have warned that the Brexit decision is affecting their businesses, highlighting how the June vote for the UK to leave the European Union is having wide repercussions. The vote roiled equity markets worldwide and led to a devaluation of sterling amid concerns over a prolonged slowdown in consumer demand. The U.K.’s decision to leave the European Union inflicted an immediate blow on the economy as business activity shrank at its fastest pace since the last recession seven years ago. The International Monetary Fund said that it had become less optimistic on global growth, and warned the damage could worsen if confidence falters among investors and companies, as fears abound over businesses and customers reining in spending during a period of uncertainty for the UK as it negotiates the terms of its exit. Mr. Perez will identify the world economies that will feel the lion’s share of the short and long-term pain to come. · The Biggest Risks for Financial Markets Constant regulatory changes and technological evolution have transformed the financial landscape so profoundly since the advent of the first electronic networks in the early 1970s. Regulators around the world are now in a race to respond to the evolution of technology in financial markets and prevent its operational challenges from becoming the biggest risk for financial markets. However, when considering technology and the cyber landscape, errors are bound to happen. Financial services firms are expected to have deployed the most sophisticated defense systems against cyberattacks. Trading firms are expected to have controls in place and invest in the technology to keep up to date. Most companies would realize the need of these investments and honestly attempt to implement them, but their IT departments would soon hit a wall, because of direct involvement from senior management and boards of directors. Compliance actions against those who missed their importance will go a long way toward restoring investor confidence and limiting the impact of the biggest risk for financial markets. · Finance in the New Global Economy Until quite recently, globalization was seen as a one-way street. Multinationals, which led the charge four decades or so ago into growing global markets, were its ambassadors, and American and European workers, whose wages and upward mobility were flattened, were feeling left out. The core idea was that globalization, technological innovation and unfettered free trade would erase historical and geographic boundaries, making the world ever more economically interconnected and alike. Developed economies would come under more and more competitive pressure from eager upstart nations. Now we are entering a new age of volatility. Financiers will become less important, manufacturers more so. Blue collar jobs will go high tech. Robots will replace Chinese workers. Mr. Perez will discuss why finance stands now in front of its biggest transformation triggered not by any of the financial conglomerates that dominate the world today but by obscure startups that could be working already in garages in Silicon Valley, Shanghai, Kiev or Delhi. · Blockchain and its impact on Finance Blockchain technology (the software behind the digital currency, Bitcoin) offers an opportunity to overhaul existing business models, including banking infrastructure, approach to settlements and customer interactions. Now it is only a matter of time before the broader financial services and banking industries shift to blockchain and network-based approaches. The application possibilities are endless, improving the way we hold and transfer secure goods from money to deeds to music to intellectual property. In fact, blockchain, as a pure platform technology, may be able to cut out the middlemen (or middle companies) everywhere, even disrupting other disruptors like Airbnb or Uber. Mr. Perez will explain why the question is not whether network business models supported by blockchain technology will disrupt organizations, but when. · China: To Rebalance or Not to Rebalance China’s 12th Five-Year Guideline in 2011 included efforts to rebalance its economy, shifting emphasis from investment towards consumption and development from urban and coastal areas toward rural and inland areas.

Officials said the investigation began when members of the Somerset County Prosecutor's Office Organized Crime and Narcotics Task Force received a tip on March 17 that Rodolfo Romero-Rosa, 34, and Luis Torres, 24, both of Perth Amboy, would be arriving in the Manville Walmart parking lot in possession of an undisclosed amount of cocaine. As a result of that information, members of the task force, along with the Manville Police Department, established a surveillance perimeter in the area of the Walmart. At approximately 7:30 p.m., officials witnessed Luis and Romero-Rosa enter the parking lot in a white pickup truck. Once there, detectives approached the truck and advised the two men of the ongoing investigation. Police said Torres, the driver of the truck, allowed detectives to search the truck. As a result, approximately three ounces of cocaine was located in the cup holder of a child's booster seat. Both Torres and Romero-Rosa were taken into police custody without incident and charged with second degree possession of a controlled dangerous substance with the intent to distribute. Officials said the estimated street value of the seized cocaine was approximately $5,000. Both men were processed and lodged in the Somerset County Jail pending a detention hearing. × Post a comment as Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.

She said I spent too much time chatting with customers who recognized me. By the time I was finished conversing, she was on Row 9 and I was on 4, stocking up on Pepsi, Reese's, and pretzels. The conversation usually centered on my column. Some liked it, others claimed they lined the bottom of the bird cage with the Sunday edition. Bob Shryocknj.com  The closest I got to a grocery store front door was the passenger seat in her Kia, heater blasting. Meanwhile, she turned a 15-minute shopping spree into an hour's marathon. When she said "I'll just be 15 minutes," you knew you were in trouble. I remembered why I never balked at her decision. "You could go in with me," she said in a consoling voice, "but you're too heavy to pick up when you fall, and someone might trip over your cane." After three or four years of grocery store hiatus, a strange thing happened the other day. My wife suggested I accompany her to Deptford's Walmart on her weekly visit. This was downright exciting, especially since I was actually permitted to go inside. She picked strategic locations for me to park my Walmart scooter and wait for her at various stops (I was tempted to sample the candy) until she finished buying out several areas of the store. Then we'd reconnect at the mouthwash aisle. She made sort of a game out of the experience. "Bob? He's fine. I think I left him at the dog food." But then the reason I wasn't permitted in any stores all that time came back to me. People. Lots of people just wanting a word or two. "I read you all the time. How old are you?" Donnell Davis, a long-time Woodbury policeman, came first. I'd talk to Donnell all day long. His parents, Digger and Jane, both deceased, were among my best friends. I played poker with his dad for 28 years. Donnell was a great kid and now he's a great husband and father. It was an uplifting couple of minutes for me. When we chat trouble seems so far away. Keeping in the sports vein, long-time Gateway educator Pete Ryan was next, talking about the years he taught my kids. Former Paulsboro athlete Rodney Davis, from another era, stepped up to wish me well. And I discovered conclusively that Walmart must be a great place to work. In the next 20 minutes five different employees approached me, said they were column readers, and wanted to know if there was anything they could do to help me. They were talking to me when I was in my battery-driven cart. Said one with a grin, "I know who you are. I read your stuff." That made eight people, only one of whom, Donnell Davis, I knew previously. And including the former Deptford football player who had kind words at the diner after Walmart, that made nine folks I wouldn't have encountered if my wife hadn't taken me off injured reserve. My warm regards to all who stepped forward. Perhaps I should apply for a job as a Walmart greeter. Bob Shryock may be reached at bshryock@njadvancemedia.com. Find NJ.com on Facebook.

ITSHOW 2017 Search for: Home > Google > Here’s the Cause of YouTube’s Ad Crisis GoogleNews Here’s the Cause of YouTube’s Ad Crisis David F. March 28, 20170140 Eric Feinberg may have caused YouTube’s ad crisis. He also has a patented solution. YouTube has recently been dealing with a rather serious problem. Major ad companies are leaving the platform after discovering that their ads have been seen on extremist videos, and content from hate groups. General Motors, Walmart, Verizon, AT&T and Johnson & Johnson have all pulled their ads from YouTube, leading to economic troubles for the platform, and also for content creators. The man to blame for all of this is named Eric Feinberg. Feinberg is a marketing-services executive who in the past few months has made it his mission to hunt down instances of ads appearing on content belonging to hate-groups or terrorists and then publishing screenshots of it to journalists in the UK and US. The result has been a mass exodus of major companies who advertise on YouTube. Feinberg is the owner of GIPEC, or Global Intellectual Property Enforcement Center, which employs “deep web interrogation” to find coding and links to hate groups online. Feinberg is also the owner of a patent issued in December for a “computerized system and method for detecting fraudulent or malicious enterprises.” His system searches for offensive terms such as “kill Jews”, and then logs thousands of innocent sounding search terms which he says “co-trend” with such language, and uses this to help him track down offensive videos. Now he’s offering his proprietary tech to companies like Google so they can easier filter their content, and remove it so advertisers don’t have to leave. What Feinberg has done is really damaging in a lot of ways. First, it damages YouTube as a platform. It is no secret that the company is struggling to break even. If not for the fact that it was owned by Google, who are shoveling money into it, almost as a public service, we might not even have YouTube right now. It certainly doesn’t need any more economic strain as a result of advertisers leaving. However, they are leaving, and this is forcing YouTube to take actions it really shouldn’t. There are many channels on YouTube these days which provide counter-cultural or politically incorrect content that is far from extremist or hateful, and yet frequently have their videos demonetized. Many such channels have to rely heavily on Patreon for funding because they simply can’t support themselves on the platform anymore. By drawing light to advertisers who are ‘linked’ to extremist content, we are thus risking losing other, perfectly legitimate content. And perhaps we could argue whether such a sacrifice would be worth it, were mr. Feinberg’s actions actually doing any good, but that’s doubtful. The vast majority of people who watch YouTube probably realize that Walmart doesn’t have someone sitting in an office, who decides manually what videos their ads should be on – it’s all done automatically by computers. There’s no intentional or contextual link between a video by a neo-Nazi and an ad for cheap school supplies that plays on top. As a result, the vast majority of people who watch YouTube really don’t care where Walmart’s ads end up. Playing devil’s advocate, Feinberg could have very noble reasons for his crusade. One could argue that preventing ads on extremist content would help block a revenue source for extremists. Certainly, this is true to a point, but one must ask if most hate groups have the kind of views that could generate a lot of money anyway: A YouTuber has many ways of inflating their income by making deals with companies to promote various products, but if we’re just talking video-adverts, most YouTubers earn around $5-8 per 1000 views. At the end of the day, these ads have been on the same videos for years without anyone making a fuss. The only reason there is a mass exodus of advertisers, and the only reason there’s a big fuss about it, is because someone decided to go on a crusade. source: Ad Age advertisementsfree speechGooglehate speechYouTube David F.

The shooting happened just before midnight Thursday night at the store on the corner of Riverdale Road and Shelby Drive. Five people were inside a black car in the parking lot when it was shot at by people in another vehicle. Two people, a 14-year-old and an 18-year-old, were injured.  The driver of the black car, which was riddled with bullets, said they were waiting in the parking lot for the car to cool down, because it had become hot. Detectives said a white or silver car, similar to a Toyota Camry, pulled up to the teens and someone opened fire. After the shooting, the victims drove to a nearby fire station for help. The teens were sent to the hospital in non-critical condition. There is no further description on the suspects. Copyright 2017 WMC Action News 5. All rights reserved.

Lange for The New York Times Air and fuel heaters at General Electric’s Gas Turbine Technology Lab in Greenville, S.C. G.E.’s chief has been outspoken about clean energy. Jeffrey R. Immelt, General Electric’s chief executive, says climate change is real, a position at odds with the Trump administration.

And environmentalists are counting on Mr. Immelt, and other executives close to the president, to use that access to argue for policies to combat global warming when the White House is rolling them back. Sign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter The companies’ business objectives and credibility are also at stake. Elon Musk of Tesla, another member of Mr. Trump’s council, is building an energy business intended to avoid the need for fossil fuels in favor of solar panels, batteries and electric vehicles. Doug McMillon of Walmart, the retail giant, has committed his company to a sharp reduction in the planet-warming gases it emits, as has Indra Nooyi of PepsiCo, the food and beverage company. BlackRock, the world’s largest publicly traded money manager — whose chief executive, Laurence D. Fink, sits on Mr. Trump’s council — has pledged to press companies to address the effects of climate change on their businesses. And Intel, Johnson & Johnson and Campbell Soup were among hundreds of businesses that urged the United States after Mr. Trump’s election to stick with last year’s Paris climate agreement and its commitment to reduce carbon emissions. “Mr. Trump says the business perspective is especially important, so hearing the business voice is critical,” said Kevin Moss, of the World Resources Institute, an environmental research group in Washington. “The companies are demonstrating that it’s in their business interest to take action on climate,” he said. “The more they’re willing to say that and take action, the stronger the message comes across.” Those hopes have become increasingly urgent as Mr. Trump — against the warnings of scientists, environmentalists and even the government’s own research — has moved to nullify the Obama administration’s efforts on climate change. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump directed the Environmental Protection Agency to start withdrawing and rewriting Mr. Obama’s Clean Power Plan, which would have closed hundreds of coal-fired power plants. In a joint statement after the order, a group of technology companies, including Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft, urged Mr. Trump to stay the course. “Strong clean energy and climate policies, like the Clean Power Plan, can make renewable energy supplies more robust and address the serious threat of climate change,” they said. That action also spurred Mr. Immelt to write a blog post to G.E.’s 300,000 employees in which he criticized the rollback. “We believe climate change is real and the science is well accepted,” said the post, first reported by Politico. “This is just the beginning of what will be a long process” of a repeal, he said, but “no matter how it unfolds, it doesn’t change what G.E. believes.” Jennifer Friedman, a General Electric spokeswoman, declined to say whether Mr. Immelt intended to relay his thoughts to Mr. Trump personally. Many other companies also declined to commit their executives to intervening with the president on climate-related policies. But Ms. Friedman emphasized that Mr. Immelt was outspoken, and she cited G.E.’s focus on clean energy, including Current, a subsidiary that focuses on products and services in energy efficiency, renewable generation and energy storage to large customers. “He’s pretty out there and clear,” he said. “That’s his position in every conversation he has.” A PepsiCo spokesman, Jay Cooney, said the company believes that “combating climate change is critical to the future of our company, customers, consumers and our world.” Kevin Gardner of Walmart, said its environmental commitments were “embedded in our business.” Thomas Hushen, spokesman for Campbell Soup, said the company supported “continued U.S. participation in the Paris agreement and the continuation of low-carbon policies and investment in a low-carbon economy.” Campbell’s chief executive, Denise Morrison, participates in Mr. Trump’s advisory council because “we believe it is important to have a voice on matters that will affect our industry, our company and our employees.” Mr. Hushen said. Corporations, especially those with strong consumer brands, have been increasingly responsive to customer and shareholder concerns about climate change. And the global nature of their businesses means many of their customers are in countries where there is a greater acceptance of the science behind climate change, and the need to tackle it. Walmart, Intel, General Motors and Lockheed Martin — all of which have senior executives on Mr. Trump’s business councils — have signed on to the principles of the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance, a coalition of nonprofit groups working to make corporate purchases of renewable energy easier. Last year, General Motors said it would generate or procure 100 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2050. Dell, another company with the president’s ear, says it expects to reduce the energy intensity of its products by 80 percent by 2020. “In many cases, I think businesses disagree with the administration,” said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, a nonprofit group that uses shareholder resolutions to advocate for greater corporate environmental and social responsibility. “People still care about climate change,” she said. “The administration may not, but they do have consumers and employees and reputations to uphold.” Some corporations’ positions on climate change are not as clear-cut as they may seem. Intel joined in a plea for the United States to honor its Paris commitments but was also among companies that submitted comments critical of the carbon pollution regulations in the Clean Power Plan. Environmentalists also worry about the influence of companies that have opposed climate regulations. General Motors and Ford, for example, successfully advocated a review of stringent federal regulations on vehicle pollution. And at least six companies with seats on Mr. Trump’s advisory boards — JPMorgan Chase, Walmart, Boeing, IBM, Dow Chemical and Lockheed Martin — also participate in the Business Roundtable, which in mid-February gave Mr. Trump a wish list of 16 rules it wanted killed, including the Clean Power Plan. (Walmart declined to address the discrepancy between that group’s demands and its climate commitments, and Intel did not respond to requests for comment.) Then there is the former ExxonMobil chief executive, Rex W. Tillerson, now secretary of state. Mr. Tillerson has publicly disparaged the Clean Power Plan, calling it “an unfortunate example of E.P.A. exceeding its authority” in a 2015 speech. But Exxon has also urged the Trump administration not to retreat from the Paris agreement and has supported a tax on carbon emissions. Businesses are pushing for policies to fight climate change “because of a well-balanced economic judgment of whether or not they should,” said Hervé Touati, a managing director at the Rocky Mountain Institute, an environmental research group. He added that sentiment among corporate executives had, after the 2009 global climate conference in Copenhagen, shifted away from the belief that fighting climate change would be too expensive. “In Paris, there was a very significant number of business leaders that had changed their minds and considered that it was going to hurt the economy if we don’t do something,” he said.

The panel backed former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue on a voice vote Thursday. In his confirmation hearing last week, Perdue stressed that he has worked with Democrats in the past, and he sought to reassure farm-state senators in both parties who are fearful about the impact of President Donald Trump's proposed deep cuts to farm programs. He also told senators concerned about Trump's trade agenda that "trade is really the answer" for farmers dealing with low crop prices. He said he would be a "tenacious advocate and fighter" for rural America when dealing with the White House and other agencies. -- The Associated Press Mortgage rates dip for 2nd week in row Mortgage rates tumbled for the second week in a row as long-term bond yields fell to their lowest level in a month. According to the latest data released Thursday by Freddie Mac, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., the 30-year fixed-rate average slid to 4.14 percent with an average 0.5 point. (Points are fees paid to a lender equal to 1 percent of the loan amount.) It was 4.23 percent a week ago and 3.71 percent a year ago. The 15-year fixed-rate average dropped to 3.39 percent with an average 0.4 point. It was 3.44 percent a week ago and 2.98 percent a year ago. The five-year adjustable rate average slipped to 3.18 percent with an average 0.4 point. It was 3.24 percent a week ago and 2.90 percent a year ago. The failure by the House of Representatives to pass health-care legislation last week fueled the move by investors from stocks to bonds, driving down yields. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 2.38 percent Monday, its lowest level since late February. Because mortgage rates tend to follow the movement of long-term bonds, home loan rates also dropped. Rates aren't expected to move much in the coming week. According to Bankrate.com, which puts out a weekly mortgage-rate trend index, nearly two-thirds of the experts it surveyed say rates will remain relatively stable. -- The Washington Post Jobless claims fall less than forecast Filings for U.S. unemployment benefits declined last week by less than forecast while remaining at levels consistent with a solid labor market, a Labor Department report showed Thursday. Unemployment claims decreased by 3,000 to 258,000 (the forecast was 247,000) in the week that ended Saturday. The number of people continuing to receive unemployment benefits increased by 65,000 to 2.05 million in the week that ended March 18. While claims are near the highest level this year, weekly filings have been below 300,000 since early 2015, a level that economists consider consistent with a healthy labor market. U.S. employers remain reluctant to let go of workers amid steady economic growth and increased difficulty finding workers with relevant skills and experience. -- Bloomberg News Big firms don't follow Trump on climate Many of America's biggest corporations including Apple Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. are sticking by their pledges to fight climate change even as President Donald Trump erases his predecessor's environmental policies. Companies say their pledges, coordinated by the Obama administration, reflect their push to cut energy costs, head off activist pressure and address a risk to their bottom line in the decades to come. "This work is embedded in our business," Wal-Mart spokesman Kevin Gardner said in an email. It's "good for the business, our shareholders and customers; if ultimately we are able to positively impact the environment in the process, that's a win too." Wal-Mart was one of 81 companies that promised to reduce emissions in the run-up to the 2015 Paris global climate negotiations. The company increased its targets last November, saying it would get half its power from renewable sources by 2025. Trump signed an order Tuesday that tells the Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider former President Barack Obama's climate rules and rescinds a series of orders Obama issued to embed consideration of climate change in government actions, from where to lease buildings to whether to allow oil pipelines to be built. -- Bloomberg News Trump University refund bids at 3,700 Former Trump University students who claimed a share of the $25 million settlement that Donald Trump agreed to shortly after he was elected president are poised to recoup 80 cents for every dollar they spent on the real-estate seminars. They sued for fraud, claiming they'd been duped by false promises of riches and instant success. After years of insisting the allegations were groundless, Trump agreed to the deal that's before the court for approval Thursday. Over half -- about 3,700 -- of the more than 6,000 former students have submitted claims to be part of the class-action settlement. That's a high participation rate for a consumer class action. A 2013 analysis by the Mayer Brown LLP law firm showed that in some cases, fewer than 1 percent of eligible beneficiaries filed claims. The case became a flash point during the 2016 presidential election campaign as critics pointed to the allegations to raise questions of whether the Republican candidate could be trusted. Trump drew further attention to it as he accused the judge, born in East Chicago, Ind., and of Mexican descent, of being biased against him because of his pledge to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico. That publicity -- the deal was reached 10 days after the election -- helped drive up the participation rate. Also significant was how much money people spent on the classes. Tuition ranged from $1,495 for a three-day seminar to $35,000 for an "elite" package. -- Bloomberg News Business on 03/31/2017 Print Headline: Business news in brief Tweet ADVERTISEMENT More Business Korean motor show opening; previews set for 2...

Photo credit: Photo courtesy of Kasey Ashenfelter Rylee Seavers | Staff Writer The Texas Hunger Initiative (THI) has received a $ 3 million dollar grant from the Walmart Foundation to help their efforts to combat hunger in Texas. THI is a capacity-building organization, meaning that they work with other organizations to increase collaboration and use existing resources efficiently, director of THI Dr. Kathy Krey said. THI works at the local, state and federal level to combat hunger through community engagement, developing policy and research, Krey said. It started out with an emphasis on combating child hunger, Krey said, but has extended its work to address hunger affecting families and senior citizens. “That’s what makes THI really unique, being housed at a university, is that we can connect all of Baylor’s great resources to the larger social issue of hunger,” Krey said. THI is part of Baylor’s “informed engagement” initiative, working with faculty and students to conduct research, Krey said. In 2015, the USDA reported that Texas was one of 12 states with a food insecurity rate higher than the national average. Krey said that this is not due to a lack of resources, rather that the existing resources are underutilized, not well coordinated or not well-known. THI helps fight those problems, Krey said. THI’s work is innovative, sustainable and research based, Krey said, which is one of the reasons that it received the grant from the Walmart Foundation. The grant will allow THI to continue outreach for child nutrition programs like school breakfast and afterschool meal programs and will help THI build coalitions in communities throughout Texas. These coalitions consist of bringing organizations and people together to maximize the efficiency of these programs. “When you can be more efficient and get more coordination, then that can go a long way as a really effective model for addressing hunger at the local level,” Krey said. Craig Nash, THI’s child hunger outreach specialist for Waco, works with organizations and school districts to aid school meal programs. His main goal is to expand access to these programs. Nash said that THI is unique because they act as a middleman to connect organizations. “I want as many kids as possible to be eating lunch through the summer food service program, through school breakfast program and after school meals,” Nash said. Krey said that being based at Baylor allows THI to work with passionate students and faculty across many disciplines to develop innovative solutions to hunger. Krey also said that there can be a disconnect between organizations trying to combat the issues of poverty and hunger and universities that have expertise on the issues. “It can be hard to bridge that gap between those two, and we stand in that place which, I think, is an important and needed role,” Krey said. In addition, Krey said that they have seen the impact of their work through a decrease in the food insecurity rate in Texas. Since THI was started, 300,000 more students are eating breakfast at school each day, 10 million more meals are being served at after school programs and there are 2,000 more summer meal sites in Texas, she said. “We play such a unique role in the anti-hunger landscape that’s really exciting, and it’s really needed because we help bolster and increase the efficacy of those organizations on the ground that really are trying to meet the need right in front of them,” Krey said.

A wild turkey has been seen the past few days trotting around the Walmart parking lot off of Winchester Road. “Well first thing that comes through is, well, Thanksgiving came early," Walmart customer Roger Lawrence said. "Second thing that you think of is safety, we don’t want that to come into play with drivers coming through. Third thing is the surprise element of it. What is a turkey doing here, this isn’t its natural habitat, and then you have to laugh about it.” An employee told WHNT News 19 that the turkey has been the talk of the store for several days, and that almost every customer that walks in points it out to everyone else. There’s no saying what’s keeping her around, but she’s certainly drawing attention. Little does this turkey know that hunting season starts April 1st, and she may want to scout out a better hiding spot! 34.820173 -86.492530 Filed in: News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email Popular UPDATE: Family hopeful after confirmed sighting of missing teen, accused kidnapper from Tenn.

Tennessee authorities say there’s been a confirmed sighting of Elizabeth Thomas, a 15-year-old girl who disappeared more than two weeks ago with Cummins, her 50-year-old teacher. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said it remains “extremely concerned” about the well-being of Elizabeth Thomas, who was last seen Monday, March 13, 2017, in Columbia, Tenn. Cummins was placed on the TBI’s Top 10 Most Wanted List. (Tennessee Bureau of Investigations via AP) (Associated Press) By Associated Press By Associated Press March 31 at 6:53 PM NASHVILLE, Tenn. — There’s been a confirmed sighting in Oklahoma of a 15-year-old girl who disappeared more than two weeks ago with her 50-year-old teacher, Tennessee authorities said Friday. Surveillance images from a Walmart in Oklahoma City show teacher Tad Cummins and Elizabeth Thomas purchasing food items in the store with cash, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said. The statement said the images captured on March 15 show Cummins had altered his hair to appear darker and Thomas may have changed her hair color to red. The two were reported missing on March 13 from Culleoka, a Tennessee community about 60 miles south of Nashville. Police have issued an Amber alert for Thomas and say they have warrants charging Cummins with sexual contact with a minor and aggravated kidnapping. Also on Friday, the teacher’s wife of 31 years filed for divorce. Court records show that Jill Cummins sued her missing husband on the grounds of irreconcilable differences and inappropriate marital conduct. The wife, who works for the Maury County school system, says she has not seen her husband since March 13. The couple has two children together. Jill Cummins has previously publicly pleaded with her husband to turn himself in and bring the girl home safely. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Northwest Arkansas is poised for continued growth from several of its key employment sectors., according to economic development officials from around the region who spoke to the Chamber Leadership Fayetteville class at noon Friday in Fayetteville. Steve Clark, CEO of the Fayetteville Chamber of Commerce, said healthcare is an obvious area of growth in the region, but technology is also a growing sector in the region and Fayetteville has dubbed itself the “Startup Capital of the South.” “Say it enough and you will make it so,” Clark said. He cites the innovation district, Fab Lab and work by Startup Junkie as contributing to the startup and technology growth around the city and region. Clark daid Highlands Oncology is now working with IBM Watson to find clinical trials for which their patients may be eligible. He said technology is changing how businesses operate in the region, nation and world. Dr. Thaddeus Beck at Highlands Oncology said Watson’s unique ability to analyze a patient’s medical record and check it against lists of complex trial eligibility criteria is helping oncologists at Highlands enroll more patients in trials and contribute to research on a local and national level. Mike Harvey, interim CEO for Northwest Arkansas Council, said the rise in technology jobs around the region has created a sizable demographic shift. He said the region’s population of 525,000 is hurdling into the unknown by 2030. He said new jobs are also raising the number of immigrants who relocate to Benton and Washington counties. He said one in five new residents is a foreign national. The influx is primarily Asian and mostly Indian who work in the technology trades in Bentonville’s third-tier of suppliers to Wal-Mart. He said IT jobs fall into the Business and Professional Services category which is also been among the faster sectors for job creation in the region. Clark said Fayetteville is well aware of the new American economy thriving largely because of foreign born individuals. He said 2,500 of the 9,000 local jobs created last year around the region was from immigrants. He said this group is more risk averse and willing to gamble on business startup. “We go to several conferences each year and this is not unique to Northwest Arkansas. It’s happening in Kansas City, Austin, and St. Louis as well. We have 1,700 international students at the University (of Arkansas) and many of them want to stay here,” he said. MANUFACTURING MAINSTAY Harvey said about 25,000 regional residents work in manufacturing and it remains an important sector for the region, but one that has been losing jobs overtime. Clark said tool maker Marshalltown located in Fayetteville for three decades has expanded it’s facility with 65,000 additional square feet and is adding about 100 new jobs. He said it’s important for the cities in the region to protect their legacy businesses. On that that point, Nathan Reed, economic development director for the Siloam Springs Chamber of Commerce, said the city and chamber worked to convince Simmons Foods to invest locally with a new wet-ingredient facility that will make pet food. Reed said the Siloam Springs-based company considered building the $26 million plant near one of its facilities in Oklahoma. But local chamber officials and the city convinced Simmons to build in Siloam Springs. Reed said the new plant will bring 78 new jobs to the city and these aren’t typical poultry line work, but are higher-paying. DOWNTOWN, REZONING Springdale Chamber of Commerce President Perry Webb said Tyson Foods and the Tyson family continue to invest in downtown Springdale, which “was all but dead, a few years ago.” “John Tyson is investing about $80 million dollars on Emma Avenue downtown over the past 12 to 14 months. … The Razorback Greenway led to new investment and a rebirth for Springdale’s downtown,” he said, adding that the city has invested in infrastructure and the private investment that followed has been exciting to watch. Debbie Griffin, vice president of communication, marketing and design for the Greater Bentonville Chamber of Commerce, said the 8th Street widening underway in Bentonville is going as scheduled. She said the exchange is supposed to help with traffic flow to and from Wal-Mart’s home office. “We have a population of 40,000, but a working population of 55,000 and our daytime population rises to 75,000 during the workday which stresses our road infrastructure. … (and) the vendors who travel into the region daily also add to the traffic congestion.” One of the hottest destinations in Northwest Arkansas is downtown Bentonville. Griffin said the 8th Street Exchange will make it easier to get there from Interstate 49 once it’s completed in 2019. The 8th Street Market is also an active scene with the new Brightwater Culinary School. She said Bike Rack Brewery will anchor one end of the 8th Street Market. Jeff Carlson, a former Walmart technology professional is one of the owners of Bike Rack. Griffin said he knew technology deals today are made while also enjoying craft beer. Yeyo’s Mexican will also locate in the 8th Street Market later this year. Steve Cox, economic development director for the Rogers Chamber of Commerce, said there is considerable work underway to transform that city’s downtown. He said with the new Haas Hall Academy to be located downtown and the expansion of the Benton County School of the Arts, there will 1,000 high school students downtown each day which will greatly add to the traffic counts for local eateries and shops. Cox said one project he’s eager to see move forward is the rezoning of about 200 acres on the west side of I-49 at the Pleasant Grove Road exit. The tract, known as Mills Family Farm, is zoned agricultural, but the family is seeking to have it rezoned for residential multifamily (22 acres), residential office (9.84 acres), commercial (152.24 acres), according to plans on file with the city. And of course, the healthcare sector is booming in the region. Harvey said roughly a half-billion dollars in healthcare investments are being made in the region over the next two years, which will add about 1,500 jobs, making it the largest growing employment sector. He said for every 100 healthcare jobs created there are about 44 other jobs also created which is likely to keep this sector outpacing others for job creation into the next decade. Clark said the $60 million expansion to Washington Regional Hospital added more than 100 new jobs and now that hospital has more rooms than the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock.

(WTNH) — It was a knock on the door they’ll never forget. Police told Michael and Taeza Pittman what happened to their son Thursday night. Their 22-year-old son Deion Pittman was killed when Connecticut State Toopers say Valery Labossiere slammed into the car Deion was riding in coming out of a Walmart parking lot on King’s Highway just off I-95 in Groton. Related Content: Stolen car pursuit leads to deadly crash in Groton It happened after a police pursuit on the highway. Police say they clocked Labossiere going 97 miles per hour in a pick-up truck that was reported stolen in Vermont. They say he exited the highway, ran a red light and hit two cars. One of them was the car in which Deion was a passenger. Labossiere was arraigned Friday. Deion’s parents stayed away from the courtroom. “That’s not really what we’re focusing on today,” Michael said. “We’re focusing on how he lived,” Taeza said. They say Deion loved life. “He was the biggest heart and biggest personality,” Taeza said. “He was active from the moment he was born, dragging us into youth football in 4th grade.” Deion had plans to become a police officer. Labossiere is being held on a $400,000 cash bond. Police say they also found a stolen, small caliber Mauser-Werke rifle in his truck. He faces numerous charges. He’ll be back in court April 24. Deion’s parents will be holding on to memories and their faith. “Deion’s in a better place,” Taeza said. “That’s what’s getting me through this. Deion’s not in any pain. Deion’s not suffering. He would want us to be OK today. It doesn’t feel OK.” Share this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Like this: Like Loading...

Tennessee authorities say there’s been a confirmed sighting of Thomas, a 15-year-old girl who disappeared more than two weeks ago with her 50-year-old teacher. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said it remains "extremely concerned" about the well-being of Thomas, a high school student who was last seen Monday, March, 13, 2017, in Columbia, Tenn. (Tennessee Bureau of Investigations via AP) (Photo: AP) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Nashville, Tenn. — There’s been a confirmed sighting in Oklahoma of a 15-year-old girl who disappeared more than two weeks ago with her 50-year-old teacher, Tennessee authorities said Friday. Surveillance images from a Wal-Mart in Oklahoma City show teacher Tad Cummins and Elizabeth Thomas purchasing food items in the store with cash, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said. The statement said the images captured on March 15 show Cummins had altered his hair to appear darker and Thomas may have changed her hair color to red. The two were reported missing on March 13 from Culleoka, a Tennessee community about 60 miles south of Nashville. Police have issued an Amber alert for Thomas and say they have warrants charging Cummins with sexual contact with a minor and aggravated kidnapping. Also on Friday, the teacher’s wife of 31 years filed for divorce. Court records show that Jill Cummins sued her missing husband on the grounds of irreconcilable differences and inappropriate marital conduct. The wife, who works for the Maury County school system, says she has not seen her husband since March 13. The couple has two children together. Jill Cummins has previously publicly pleaded with her husband to turn himself and bring the girl home safely. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

By Malaika Fraley | mfraley@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: March 31, 2017 at 1:59 pm | UPDATED: March 31, 2017 at 3:35 pm UNION CITY — A 23-year-old Hayward woman has been charged with seven misdemeanors for hitting a pregnant woman and two others with her car in the parking lot of a Walmart in Union City on March 19. Jessica Ann Malicoat is suspected of backing her Honda Accord out of a parking stall and hitting three people, none of whom were significantly injured. Police said one of the victims heard Malicoat say, “Move,” followed by a vulgar term for a woman, before striking the group. Jessica Malicoat  Video surveillance shows numerous people “running from the parking lot in fear” after Malicoat struck the people and then reversed a second time “nearly striking the mother and a 3-year-old child again,” police wrote in court documents this week. Malicoat pleaded not guilty on Monday to seven misdemeanors: one count of leaving the scene of an accident, and three counts each of assault with a deadly weapon and battery. The pregnant woman suffered bruising to her stomach, ankle and finger. Injuries, any, suffered by another woman and a 13-year-old girl struck were not disclosed by police. Malicoat allegedly told police that she was on her cell phone during the incident and thought her boyfriend was a having a medical emergency. “She only thought she struck a shopping cart, and fled the scene because she was scared,” a detective wrote in a probable cause declaration. Police were called to the Walmart at 30600 Dyer St. on March 19 at 6 p.m. and identified Malicoat as the driver of the Accord, based on anonymous tips received after issuing a press release. Police said Malicoat had been trying to flee security guards at the Walmart, accused of stealing batteries and trying to get a refund for them. Malicoat is free from jail on $55,000 bail. She is scheduled to return to court on Monday for a pretrial hearing.     Tags:  East Bay Crime hit and run Malaika Fraley East Bay native Malaika Fraley is an award-winning criminal justice reporter with 16 years experience covering Bay Area courthouses.

TBI officials say a tip led investigators to view surveillance images from a Walmart on East I-240 Service Road in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma from the afternoon of March 15. Officials say the people in the images are confirmed to be Tad Cummins and Elizabeth Thomas shopping at the store. Investigators say Cummins used cash to purchase various food items but did not purchase anything else of significance. The surveillance images of Cummins and Thomas are the first obtained by investigators since the alleged kidnapping on March 13. These images were released on Friday. #TNAMBERAlert SIGHTING CONFIRMED: Tad Cummins and Elizabeth Thomas were in Oklahoma City on March 15th. DETAILS: https://t.co/PtEHq8npp2 pic.twitter.com/cLhDJRBCd3— TBI (@TBInvestigation) March 31, 2017 The video shows Cummins appears to have altered his altered appearance to darken his hair. The same images show Elizabeth may currently have red hair. Efforts to determine what vehicle they were traveling in remain ongoing. This information was released a day after a false sighting of the pair in Collierville, Tennessee. A man and his daughter were mistaken for Cummins and Thomas. Thomas disappeared on March 13 and is believed to have been kidnapped by 50-year-old Cummins, a former teacher at her school in Maury County, Tennessee. The school district in Maury County terminated Cummins in the wake of an ongoing investigation into alleged inappropriate contact he had with Thomas at the school earlier this year. Early on, we issued the picture on the left, from several days before the #TNAMBERAlert, Note the apparent change in Tad's appearance. pic.twitter.com/ZaET35u0C7— TBI (@TBInvestigation) March 31, 2017 Cummins is believed to be armed and driving a silver Nissan Rogue with Tennessee tag 976-ZPT. A warrant has been issued for Cummins for sexual contact with a minor and aggravated kidnapping. Cummins has been added him to the state’s top 10 most wanted’ list. There is a $1,000 reward for information leading to his capture. The TBI asks anyone with information to report it to 1-800-TBI-FIND or local law enforcement. Copyright 2017 WAFF.

Those 600 or more trucks will be moving back and forth daily between the Port of Mobile and Wal-Mart's super-sized new regional distribution center west of Mobile in the Grand Bay area. It's a lot of heavy-hauling semis for 25 miles of expressway that connect the city's core to heavily populated areas west and south, as local leaders acknowledge. "We are aware of the traffic," said Mobile County Commissioner Jerry Carl. Said Jimmy Lyons, director and CEO of the Alabama State Port Authority: "They are convinced the roads are sufficient. They looked hard at this site and other sites." 'Roads are sufficient': Walmart distribution center is coming to costal Alabama, and so are lots of trucks https://t.co/sOMkEP9Sy1 pic.twitter.com/g4OXPyljem — AL.com (@aldotcom) March 29, 2017The big-truck issue was one of the topics that arose following March 29's official announcement at APM Terminals that Wal-Mart's $135 million distribution center is expected deliver a jolt to container traffic at the Mobile port. Lyons said the port anticipates a 10% increase in container activity, a figure that amounts to 25,000 containers annually. The Port of Mobile already ranks among the most active ports along the Gulf of Mexico. Lyons said that transport of the Wal-Mart-bound containers to the regional distribution center will involve about three trucks each. Already, more than 44,000 vehicles travel along I-10 each day in west Mobile County, although there is no breakdown on how many of those are semi-tractor trailers. The distribution center, when fully operational, will be a logistics hub for the nation's No. 1 retailer, which also ranks No. 3 on the Transport Topics Top 100 list of the largest private carriers in North America. The center will service approximately 800 of Wal-Mart's 4,600 U.S. stores. Those 800 stores are scattered over a sweeping area of the nation's heartland, from Alabama and Mississippi northward to the Great Lakes region. 1 2 3 Next >> By John Sharp Alabama Media Group, Birmingham   Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

Matthew Heller March 30, 2017 | CFO.com | US share Tweet Email Print - Print + Email this article To* Please enter your email address* Subject* Comments* Amazon is shutting down Diapers.com and five other shopping websites operated by Quidsi, citing the failure of the division to turn a profit since Amazon acquired it in November 2010. The shutdown will result in the loss of more than 250 jobs at Quidsi, which was founded by Marc Lore, now the head of Wal-Mart’s e-commerce operations. The other sites affected include Soap.com, Wag.com, and BeautyBar.com. Recommended Stories: GoPro Shares Jump on News of More Job Cuts Neiman Marcus Said to Be in Talks Over Sale Juniper Crashes Brave New Worlds of Networking “We have worked extremely hard for the past seven years to get Quidsi to be profitable and unfortunately we have not been able to do so,” an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. Quidsi’s software development team will focus on building technology for the grocery delivery service AmazonFresh, the statement said. According to Reuters, the move “underscores a shift in Amazon’s focus to groceries and other areas” since it closed the $500 million acquisition of Quidsi. “Fresh food represents a large and fledgling market for online retailers, in contrast to goods such as diapers that have been the subject of price wars in recent years.” “Consumables like soap and pet food are often priced very competitively by retailers in order to drive price perception and ultimately drive online and in-store traffic,” Guru Hariharan, chief executive of retail technology company Boomerang Commerce, told Reuters. “While unfortunate, the shutting down of the Quidsi sites isn’t completely surprising.” The Quidsi acquisition was Amazon’s fourth-largest to date. Since the deal, Amazon had continued to invest in Quidsi, launching new brands such as green grocer VineMarket.com and putting the individual sites on mobile devices. “Amazon had originally snapped up Quidsi to eliminate the competition on the market, but the sites today overlap a lot with its core business,” TechCrunch said, citing AmazonFamily, which is aimed at helping new parents save on diapers and other items. Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said Amazon Prime had likely “grown to the point where members no longer separately shop on Diapers.com or Soap.com so maintenance of separate product-specific sites makes less sense.” Post navigation ← Pressed by Investors, CFOs Awake to Sustainability Democrats Seek Probe of Acting SEC Chair → Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The meeting is expected to try to persuade brands to ship direct-to-consumer, by-passing retail chains. Attendees to the event will tour an Amazon fulfillment center and hear from Jeff Wilke, Amazon’s worldwide consumer chief. An invitation to the event obtained by Bloomberg reads: “Times are changing. Amazon strongly believes that supply chains designed to serve the direct-to-consumer business have the power to bring improved customer experiences and global efficiency. To achieve this requires a major shift in thinking.” “Amazon’s bold move to convince the world’s biggest brands to sell directly to online shoppers should come as no surprise to anyone in the industry, and it is highly likely that Walmart, Costco and others saw this coming," said Tushar Patel, CMO, Kibo. "At the end of the day, we believe the decision will all come down to price, shipping times and fulfillment. In a recent survey, we found 70% of consumers said price is the most important factor when making purchases online with product brand being the second most important factor— influencing 12% of consumers—and retailer brand the third most important factor at 6%. This obviously tells us that consumers will choose pricing over a retailer brand if they can obtain their desired product at the time required." The question remains what Amazon's interests are in this meeting, since it is retailer that sells products. It is possible Amazon may want CPG manufacturers to transform into marketplace vendors in Amazon's fulfillment capabilities. If CPG brand manufacturers are selling direct, Amazon may be able to get them to sell through Amazon. "The primary opportunity / threat for retailers and brands alike lies in the marketplace," said Jenn Markey, VP Marketing, 360pi. "Marketplaces let retailers build that endless online shelf without the cost and risk associated with physical stores. Brands can leverage marketplaces as 1P sellers or via 3P sellers and marketplace sellers aren’t typically beholden to one retail channel - and brands would be wise to keep it that way when Amazon “comes-a-calling”. So the marketplace, or digital department store, helps create a new, much more level online playing field for all parties."  As more retail look to transform their brick and mortar locations into fulfilment centers with ship from store capabilities, Amazon may also be seeking to overcome this new competition in its primary area of success. "No matter what decision comes out of the Seattle event in May, brick-and-mortar stores will still be a major player for selling direct to consumers," said Patel. "We believe brands will stand to benefit from leveraging fulfillment best practices of big box retailers by utilizing locations, warehouses, and logistics to implement options like buy online, pick-up in store, return to store, or ship-from store for their consumers. These brands have inherited channels they did not have before and can realistically compete with Amazon if they continue to focus on price, shipping and order fulfillment.” SHARE YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Customer Service Amazon May Add a Chatbot to Greet Customers and Plans Colorado Fulfillment Center Customer Service Amazon Boasts Record Growth in 2014 Omnichannel Amazon Upping its Grocery Game?

vator vatorX vatornews Register Log in Newsroom Innovation series Interviews Lessons learned Trends & news Amazon turns to social media influencers to spread the word Amazon is currently facing competition from Jet and its parent company Walmart Financial trends and news by Steven Loeb March 31, 2017 | Comments Short URL: http://vator.tv/n/4943 There's a joke that Louis C.K. tells about Amazon reviews, the jist of it being that we're reading these reviews and we have no idea who wrote them. For all we know, the person could be insane, or dead, and we're trusting their advice on what you should and shouldn't buy. It's a really funny bit, only because it's absolutely true. For some reason, we have no problem trusting strangers on the Internet to give us advice. I don't know if this is much of a problem for most people, or if the majority even think about it, but Amazon apparently believes it is, as the company is turning to a new group to help spread the word, one that it hopes will be a more trusted source for recommendations. Amazon has launched an Influencer Program to get users who have large social media followings to help promote Amazon products around the Web. Users are able to apply through the site to be influencers, but the program is currently invitation only. Amazon reviews all submissions and reviews "various factors including but not limited to number of followers on various social media platforms, engagement on posts, quality of content and level of relevancy for Amazon.com." Amazon also notes that there is "no set cut-off" in the number of followers a user has to have and that" influencers across all tiers and categories are represented in the program." If someone is chosen to be an Amazon influencer, they will be contacted by the company via e-mail, and will get a vanity URL to link to on social media. If someone makes a purchase through that URL, the influencer gets paid. The program is currently in beta, and there's no indication right now that there are plans to expand it. Amazon vs Walmart The launch of the Influencer Program comes at an interesting time for Amazon, as it ramps up its war with Jet. On Wednesday it was reported by Bloomberg that Amazon is shutting down Quidsi, which it bought for $545 million in 2010. Quidsi is the parent company of shopping sites that include Diapers.com, Wag.com and Soap.com. Perhaps influencing that decisions is the fact that Quidsi founder Marc Lore is also the founder of Jet.com, which was sold to Walmart for $3 billion last August. Lore now runs e-commerce operations for Walmart.  Jet emerged as a true competitor to Amazon, and the two companies engaged is what was called a "price war," with each side attempting to undercut the other by giving users better deals. That war now seems to be happening between Amazon and Walmart. Amazon has long been the leader in e-commerce, but it now facing some real competition. While introducing an Influencer Program won't lead to lower prices on Amazon, it is a way the company to potentially leverage its size and scope to lure users back to the site. The whole point of influencers is that they are a trusted source for advice. Their word should mean more than a random review, or an advertisement. If Amazon can put its vast network of users to good use, that might help it gain a leg up on Jet and Walmart.  This program was first discovered by TechCrunch.  VatorNews reached out to Amazon for comment.

DETAILS: https://t.co/PtEHq8npp2 pic.twitter.com/cLhDJRBCd3 — TBI (@TBInvestigation) March 31, 2017 The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has confirmed a sighting of 15-year-old Elizabeth Thomas along with the 50-year-old man believed to have kidnapped her earlier this month. Late Thursday, after receiving information from a tip, investigators obtained surveillance images from a Walmart in Oklahoma City from the afternoon of March 15th, showing Tad Cummins and Thomas shopping at the store. Officials said Cummins used cash to purchase various food items, but did not purchase anything else of significance. The surveillance images of Cummins and Thomas – the first obtained by investigators since the alleged kidnapping on March 13th – clearly show Tad Cummins with an altered appearance to darken his hair. The same images show Elizabeth may currently have red hair. Efforts to determine what vehicle they were using in Oklahoma remain ongoing. This is the first confirmed sighting of the two since they disappeared earlier this month. Early on, we issued the picture on the left, from several days before the #TNAMBERAlert, Note the apparent change in Tad's appearance. pic.twitter.com/ZaET35u0C7 — TBI (@TBInvestigation) March 31, 2017 Cummins was being investigated after he was reportedly spotted kissing Thomas in his classroom. Cummins, who had taught Elizabeth in a forensics class at a high school in Culleoka, some 50 miles southwest of Nashville, is charged with kidnapping her. An Amber Alert was issued for Elizabeth on March 14, the day after a sheriff’s department had declared her missing. Cummins is believed to be armed with two handguns and driving a silver Nissan Rogue with Tennessee tag 976-ZPT. A warrant has been issued for Cummins for Sexual Contact with a Minor and Aggravated Kidnapping. On Friday, the TBI added him to the state’s ‘Top 10 Most Wanted’ list. There is a $1,000 reward for information leading to his capture. As of this morning, the TBI had  received more than 1,200 tips from across the country. The TBI urges the public to remain vigilant and report any information that may prove beneficial in the ongoing search to 1-800-TBI-FIND. If you spot the vehicle and can verify the license plate to be TN 976-ZPT, call 911 immediately.

(AP) – There’s been a confirmed sighting in Oklahoma of a 15-year-old girl who disappeared more than two weeks ago with her 50-year-old teacher, Tennessee authorities said Friday. Elizabeth Thomas and Tad Cummins (NBC Photo) Surveillance images from a Walmart in Oklahoma City show teacher Tad Cummins and Elizabeth Thomas purchasing food items in the store with cash, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said. The statement said the images captured on March 15 show Cummins had altered his hair to appear darker and Thomas may have changed her hair color to red. The two were reported missing on March 13 from Culleoka, a Tennessee community about 60 miles south of Nashville. Police have issued an Amber alert for Thomas and say they have warrants charging Cummins with sexual contact with a minor and aggravated kidnapping. Also on Friday, the teacher’s wife of 31 years filed for divorce. Court records show that Jill Cummins sued her missing husband on the grounds of irreconcilable differences and inappropriate marital conduct. The wife, who works for the Maury County school system, says she has not seen her husband since March 13. The couple has two children together. Jill Cummins has previously publicly pleaded with her husband to turn himself and bring the girl home safely. #TNAMBERAlert SIGHTING CONFIRMED: Tad Cummins and Elizabeth Thomas were in Oklahoma City on March 15th.

The pictures were captured by CCTV at a Walmart in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, two days after the 15-year-old disappeared from her home in Tennessee on March 13. TBI 6 New images show fugitive teacher Tad Cummins and abducted student Elizabeth The pictures show that both have died their hair to try avoid being spotted – with blonde Elizabeth now a redhead and Cummins dying his hair and beard from grey-brown to black. TENNESSEE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION 6 Elizabeth Thomas has been missing since March 13 Elizabeth can be seen wearing one of Cummins’ plaid shirts while the former science teacher wears a black T. shirt. The pair bought some food supplies before hitting the road again. TBI 6 The pair have both dyed their hair Authorities now believe that the pair may have made it Mexico – as so much time has passed since they went missing. Police believe that Cummins had been grooming the teen for sex for weeks before they disappeared. Just days before he allegedly kidnapped Elizabeth he googled ‘teen marriage‘. TENNESSEE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION 6 Tad Cummins allegedly groomed Elizabeth for weeks Elizabeth meanwhile changed her Instagram bio to “wife”. Investigators said the teen may have gone willingly with her captor – although one of her 10 siblings said she told them to call the police if she hadn’t returned home by 6pm on the day she went missing. Cummins, a dad and grandad, is believed to be armed with two handguns.

Posted By: Sunil Fernandes Updated: Friday, March 17, 2017, 9:30 [IST] Subscribe to GoodReturns Markets are not exactly cheap at the moment and it is difficult to find stocks that are good long term bets, as well as stocks that are low priced. Here are a few stocks that could be great buying opportunities in India at the current levels. They are low priced stocks that may not have a face value of Rs 10, though are inexpensive. Welspun India Welspun India is the world's second largest terry towel producer in the world. It is also among the top three home textile manufacturers in the world and the largest home textile company in Asia. The company supplies to to 17 of the top 30 global retailers across the wold including names like Bed Bath and Beyond, Macy's, Wal-Mart and JC Penney among others. 34% of FY16 sales of the company came from innovative products and 13% of FY16 sales from branded products. The promoters continue to have a solid holding of more than 73 per cent in the company. Huge potential for growth in Welspun India The company has a key market in the US, whose home textile market alone is worth $45 billion. India has some advantage in the export markets vis a vis markets like China on account of being the largest exporter of cotton and also having a 25 per cent surplus cotton, which is exported. All these play to the advantage of Welspun, which has a very large share in the terry towel market across the globe. In fact, India's share in the towel business has increased 10 per cent in the last 6 years. Welspun India: Excellent low prices stock with good fundamentals In the next few years, the company's flooring business which was recently set up will start driving growth, which should be a big positive. For the quarter ending December 31, 2017, the company reported an EPS of Rs 1.5, with a net profit of Rs 154.94crores. If we assume that it reports an EPS of Rs 10 next year (2017-18), the stock is not heavily priced at a p/e of just 7 times one year forward. A great low priced stock to buy at the current p/e levels. Check stock quote of Welspun here Gitanjali Gems The biggest trigger for this stock is that its subsidiary Nakshatra World has filed for an IPO. According to some unconfirmed numbers the company would raise Rs 650 crores. Nakshatra sells jewellery under the established brands of Nakshatra, Gili, Asmi, Sangini, Diya, Parineeta and Rivaaz. Gitanjali's own network of own stores, shop-in-shops and franchise outlets spans across 200 cities and 3,000 points of sale. We believe that going forward this company could improve its performance and the share price move higher. Low priced stock at low valuations and less risk The company has already reported an EPS of Rs 5 for the first three quarters and even if it does an EPS of Rs 6-7, the p/e of the company is barely 10 times. Gitanjali is planning to reduce debt and start the de-leveraging exercise. this should make it a great low priced stock to buy in India. Check stock quote of Gitanjali here       South Indian Bank This is one banking stock that has not seen a great rally. We believe that in the coming quarters the bank will improve its non performing assets a great deal. In fact, the stock is trading at a p/e of just about 7 times one year forward earnings. At Rs 20, there is nothing much to lose in South Indian Bank stock. Buy on declines this low prices banking stock.

Sections Deseret NewsSports Sports Doug Robinson: This is one weird Final Four By Doug RobinsonDeseret News Published: March 31, 2017 12:55 p.m. Updated: 12 hours ago 2 Comments View 6 Items , The Final Four will be held this weekend. Time for roll call. Michigan State? Nope. Duke? No — Coach K’s team got KO’d. Kentucky? No — The one-and-done crew is primping for the draft. Indiana? No (they’re so yesterday anyway ) UCLA? No. Kansas and Louisville? No and no. North Carolina? Present and accounted for — of course. Lets’s face it, this is one weird Final Four field. The rich, cool kids are missing. The annual gathering of blueblood basketball schools has been crashed by Gonzaga, Oregon and South Carolina. Sure there’s an occasional Butler of VCU from year to year but this year there are three of those all at once. Three of the four teams are here for the first time. In an event dominated by a handful of powerhouses — the rich getting richer and so forth — this is unprecedented. It’s one thoroughbred and three Seabiscuits. For North Carolina, it’s business as usual — they’re just trying not to yawn; the rest of them will try to act like they’ve been here before but they haven’t. Hey, look, the hotel has a swimming pool! Just like that, every basketball coach in America has new fodder for his pregame speech. Hey, kids, look what South Carolina did  If they can do it. The 2017 Final Four — the college basketball version of Hoosiers. This just doesn’t happen in the NCAA Tournament. Of the 308 berths that were claimed by teams during the 77-year history of the Final Four, 122 of them have been filled by just nine teams (about 40 percent): North Carolina (20), UCLA (18), Kentucky (17), Duke (16), Kansas (14), Louisville (10), Ohio State (10), Michigan State (9), Indiana (8). They are to basketball what Wal-Mart and Exxon are to business. This 2017 Final Four field is an aberration and introductions are in order: South Carolina, a football school, was the seventh seed in the East Region, the third-place finisher in the weak SEC. They ended the season by losing six of their last 10 games, including the opener of the SEC Tournament. After going 44 years without winning an NCAA tournament game, they beat Marquette, Duke, Baylor and Florida to reach the Final Four. Gonzaga is a 7,500-student Catholic University in Spokane, Washington that's named after Aloysius Gonzaga, a 16th-century Italian monk who was canonized in 1726. Until last week, the school’s biggest claim to fame was John Stockton, a local kid who starred for the Bulldogs in the early ‘80s (maybe you’ve heard of him). The Bulldogs were a novelty act when they advanced to the Elite Eight in 1999 in only their second appearance in the tournament, but then they kept returning year after year — 19 straight years and counting, including three Elite Eight berths. The Oregon Ducks are another football school known widely for their ever-changing colorful apparel that is produced by a certain local shoe company (they have more outfit changes than a Taylor Swift concert). Oregon appeared in the inaugural Final Four in 1939 and then waited almost eight decades to return. Then there’s North Carolina. Genuflect when you say that. The Tar Heels are probably wondering how all the riff-raff was invited to the party. They’ve been here before of course — 20 times, in fact, the most by any school. Coach Roy Williams is making his ninth Final Four appearance. This is just what the Heels do — every 3.85 years 2 comments on this story Oregon and Gonzaga make this Final Four an oddity in other ways, as well. Since 1975, only three teams from the West (west of Kansas) have won the national title — UNLV (1990), UCLA (1995) and Arizona (1997). If you toss out UCLA, only 10 Western teams have won the national title in 77 years. For that matter, only two teams from the West have made it as far as the Final Four since 1998 (UCLA and Arizona). This year there are two of them. If Gonzaga and Oregon win their semifinal games, it would not only set up an all-West final, it would also match up two neighboring states. And if North and South Carolina win their semifinal games, it would set up an all-Carolina final. All of which makes this one of the most unlikely, intriguing Final Fours ever. Like that? Read this.

(Tennessee Bureau of Investigations via AP) NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — There's been a confirmed sighting in Oklahoma of a 15-year-old girl who disappeared more than two weeks ago with her 50-year-old teacher, Tennessee authorities said Friday. Surveillance images from a Walmart in Oklahoma City show teacher Tad Cummins and Elizabeth Thomas purchasing food items in the store with cash, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said. The statement said the images captured on March 15 show Cummins had altered his hair to appear darker and Thomas may have changed her hair color to red. The two were reported missing on March 13 from Culleoka, a Tennessee community about 60 miles south of Nashville. Police have issued an Amber alert for Thomas and say they have warrants charging Cummins with sexual contact with a minor and aggravated kidnapping.

Also on Friday, the teacher's wife of 31 years filed for divorce. Court records show that Jill Cummins sued her missing husband on the grounds of irreconcilable differences and inappropriate marital conduct. The wife, who works for the Maury County school system, says she has not seen her husband since March 13. The couple has two children together. Jill Cummins has previously publicly pleaded with her husband to turn himself in and bring the girl home safely. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Tim Cook/The Day) Published March 31. 2017 6:36AM | Updated March 31. 2017 9:01PM By Karen Florin  Day staff writer k.florin@theday.com  KFLORIN A judge set bond at $400,000 cash Friday for a man involved in a police pursuit and crash on Route 184 in Groton Thursday that led to the death of 22-year-old Deion Anthony Pittman of Waterford. Valery Labossiere, 27, of Medford, Mass. was arraigned before New London Superior Court Judge Emmet L. Cosgrove on charges of first-degree larceny, sixth-degree larceny, reckless driving, disobeying the signal of an officer, engaging police in pursuit and driving without a license. "The state is proceeding with a warrant to add some type of homicide charge," said prosecutor Sarah W. Bowman. The crash occurred at 10:15 p.m. State police said Labossiere was driving a 2013 Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck stolen out of Vermont when a trooper parked in the center median of the Gold Star Bridge conducting traffic enforcement clocked his speed at 97 miles per hour as Labossiere drove north over the bridge. The trooper caught up with the truck and activated his lights and siren in an attempt to stop the truck, according to a police report. The trooper remained behind the truck, and said at one point it appeared it was stopping in the area of the left lane exit to Route 184.  Labossiere then sped up and exited the highway, police said, and was traveling east on Route 184 when, at the intersection of Kings Highway, he drove through a red light and into the right side of a 2003 Mitsubishi Eclipse. The Mitsubishi, police said, had just exited the Walmart parking lot. It was traveling south on Kings Highway and had the right of way. A trooper took Labossiere, the sole occupant, out of the driver's seat and handcuffed him without incident, according to the report. The trooper noticed a 22-caliber rifle on the floor of the truck and police determined later that it had been stolen on March 29 from the same Vermont residence as the pickup truck. The troopers said Labossiere, who suffered injuries that were not life-threatening, was carrying an expired Haitian passport. His Massachusetts driver's license had been suspended. He was treated at The William W. Backus Hospital and returned to Troop E in Montville for processing. Police identified Taylor Wilkinson, 20, of 210 Midway Oval, Groton, as the driver of the Mitsubishi. A Groton Ambulance crew took her to Lawrence + Memorial Hospital with minor injuries. A Life Star helicopter responded to take her passenger, Pittman, of 47 Miner Ave., Waterford, to Hartford Hospital, where he later died. Pittman's family members did not attend Labossiere's arraignment Friday but spoke to a court official. According to bail commissioner Timothy Gilman, Labossiere lives with his father in Medford. Gilman said Labossiere has no means of support, underlying mental health issues and a limited criminal record. On March 16, a Massachusetts judge placed him on probation for a year for receiving stolen property, providing police with a false address and driving while his license is suspended, Gilman said. The case was continued for a year. Attorney Jennifer L. Baldwin from the public defender's office said Labossiere's father, who works as a cab driver, was on his way to Connecticut Friday after learning of the incident. On a state police booking form, Labossiere listed his nationality as "U.S." and his occupation as "elder care." In setting the $400,000 cash bond, Judge Cosgrove cited the seriousness of the charges. He said the case would be considered for transfer to the court where major felonies are heard. He ordered a medical and mental health watch for Labossiere and continued the case to April 24. State police are asking anyone who witnessed the crash or the seconds leading up to it to contact Trooper Donald Comstock at (203) 630-8086 or at Donald.Comstock@ct.gov.

Hate-filled videos mislead children, poison the online experience for everyone, and serve as an unfortunate, yet effective, tool to recruit new generations of violent extremists. Now, ADL is seeing the impact of its efforts on online hate videos: Google, including its subsidiary YouTube, and virtually all other major online video sites have developed policies, employed teams, and put technologies in place to tackle the problem of online hate. Share Facebook Twitter Pinterest Email Twitter Gives Online Hate Speech Its Biggest Platform — Why? Lilly MaierOctober 18, 2016 Major brands — including Starbucks, Walmart, PepsiCo, AT&T, Verizon, Volkswagen and Johnson & Johnson — recently joined ADL in the condemnation of online hate, and they did it in a public way that shines a light on the problem and should dramatically impact Google’s bottom line. These advertisers pulled their ads from YouTube because Google’s ad placement algorithms allowed ads of these brands to appear before hate videos. The Times of London estimates Google stands to lose a whopping $750 million in annual revenue as a result of the pulled advertising. Google has acknowledged the need for improvement when it comes to the placement of ads on hate videos, though the company suggests, in the vast majority of cases, its policies work as intended. Google reportedly spends millions of dollars and employs thousands of people to stop bad advertising practices. Last year, it said it removed nearly two billion “bad ads” and prevented 300 million others from showing up on YouTube. ADL is sympathetic to Google’s problem. The scale of the problem is immense. There are millions of sites in its network, and 400 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every single minute. Google says it’s close to eliminating the placement of “bad ads.” But for the advertisers abandoning Google en masse because of mistaken ad placements, close is not good enough. ADL is eager, as we have in the past, to work with Google on this next chapter of the fight against online hate. We caution against overreaction and hope legitimate free expression is not affected by new filtering approaches. Determining what is and what is not hate speech is often a nuanced exercise that cannot be left entirely to artificial intelligence. Share Facebook Twitter Pinterest Email Google ‘Responsible’ for Dissemination of Holocaust Denial Dan FriedmanDecember 11, 2016 The current crisis is an opportune time for Google and other online companies to consider innovative approaches to the problem. Years ago, when a search of the term “Jew” on Google returned the website of a virulently anti-Semitic website, Google placed an ADL ad alongside the search result so users could access information on anti-Semitism and hate speech. A similar approach is necessary in this new world of online video hate. Since the advent of the internet, ADL has encouraged online platforms to take online hate seriously. The recent episode with Google shows that others, including major corporations, share ADL’s serious concern. The time to develop new solutions to combat this pernicious problem is now.

Investigators say they were captured on surveillance video on March 15th at a Walmart in Oklahoma City on East I-240 Service Road, which was two days after the pair disappeared. Investigators say the video shows that Cummins has altered his appearance to darken his hair, and Elizabeth appears to have red hair. They used cash to purchase several food items but nothing else of significance, investigators say. TBI: HELP BRING ELIZABETH HOME The TBI says the teen disappeared March 13 after being kidnapped by Cummins, a former teacher at her school in Tennessee. "Some have characterized this as a romance," said the Director of the TBI, Mark Gwyn. "Let me be very clear: She is 15. A child. He is 50. A grown man. This is and was not a romance. This was manipulation," he said. This is not a fairytale. This is a case of kidnapping and we remain gravely concerned for the well-being of this young girl," said Gwyn. RELATED: NO SIGHTINGS OF MISSING 15-YEAR-OLD AND TEACHER Authorities have asked law enforcement in Mexico and Central America to be on the lookout for them as a precaution only. The Tennessee agency got a tip last week that the teacher's car may have been spotted in Corpus Christi, Texas, but police there were not able to confirm it. Other than this spotting in Oklahoma City, there have been no other confirmed sightings of the pair since that day. Anyone who spots the car is being asked to try and safely snap a picture and call 911 immediately. "It only takes one lead," investigators said. Thomas is described as a 15-year-old white female with hazel eyes, 5 feet tall, around 120 pounds. She was last seen wearing a flannel shirt and black leggings. Cummins is described as 6 feet tall, about 200 pounds with brown hair and brown eyes. Investigators believe he is armed with two handguns and driving a silver Nissan Rogue with the Tennessee tag: 976-ZPT. Cummins faces charges of sexual contact with a minor and aggravated kidnapping and there is a reward for information leading to his capture.   false false false false false false false false false Popular false false false Recent FBI re-releases 9/11 Pentagon photos Crayola boots dandelion for bluish crayon Houston man taped to street sign after losing bet WATCH: Villagers give this thirsty cobra a drink Police: Handyman held woman captive Stories You May Be Interested In – includes Advertiser Stories false false false All content © Copyright 2000-2015 Fox Television Stations, Inc.

Cummins, 50, and Thomas were captured on surveillance footage at a Oklahoma City Wal-Mart shopping for food on March 15, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation announced. The pair — who are from Maury County, Tennessee— did not purchase anything else of significance. In the newly released video and images, Thomas and Cummins’ appear to have dyed their hair. Thomas, who was originally described by officials as a blonde, has red hair while Cummins’ goatee beard and hair are darker. MEDIA: Here's a quick video clip of Tad Cummins & Elizabeth Thomas entering the Walmart in Oklahoma City on 3/15.https://t.co/DROy0gqIMc — Josh DeVine (@TBIJoshDeVine) March 31, 2017 Tennessee Bureau of Investigations Tennessee Bureau of Investigations • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage? Click here to get breaking crime news, ongoing trial coverage and details of intriguing unsolved cases in the True Crime Newsletter.  Tennessee Bureau of Investigations Thomas was reported missing on March 13, after she asked a friend to drop her off at a local Shoney’s. Investigators allege she was abducted by a teacher at her school, 50-year-old Tad Cummins. Thomas’ family has accused Cummins of “grooming” her. The photos released Friday are the first photos of the pair since they were reported missing. It remains unclear whether Thomas went with Cummins willingly. Elizabeth Thomas’ hair appears to be dyed red Tennessee Bureau of Investigations A warrant has been issued for Cummins’ arrest on charges of aggravated kidnapping and sexual contact with a minor. He was fired from Culleoka Unit School after he was identified as the suspect in Thomas’ disappearance. Prior to that, he was suspended by the school after he allegedly was caught kissing Thomas on Jan. 23. Prosecutors also allege the pair traded “romantic” messages via his school email. • Pick up PEOPLE’s special edition True Crime Stories: Cases That Shocked America, on sale now, for the latest on Casey Anthony, JonBenét Ramsey and more. The confirmed sighting comes less than a day after Collierville, Tennessee, officials told local media outlets the pair had been spotted driving a white van in Collierville. However, hours later, state officials announced the sighting was false. This is not the first time officials have had to warn the public of “erroneous” reporting. Last week, the pair were rumored to be in Texas when Corpus Christi police said they responded to an alleged sighting. But a TBI spokesperson dismissed the reports, telling PEOPLE that the pair have been allegedly spotted in 49 states so far. Authorities allege Cummins is likely keeping Thomas “off the grid,” and they urge the public to search their properties, local campgrounds, rural areas and parking garages.

The teen was last seen wearing a flannel shirt and black leggings. She is 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighs 120 lbs., with and hazel eyes. Cummins was seen driving a Silver Nissan Rogue with Tennessee license plate 976ZPT, according to the TBI. He is 6 feet tall and weighs 200 lbs., with brown hair and eyes. Anyone with information on Cummins or Thomas should call the TBI at 1-800-TBI-FIND.

These six signs indicate that the e-commerce and cloud giant’s best days are still ahead. Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Mar 31, 2017 at 1:05PM Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) rallied 330% over the past five years -- an incredible run for a company that was already the world's largest online retailer. But even after that great rally, which lifted the company's enterprise value to over $400 billion, Amazon doesn't seem to be slowing down at all. Analysts expect Amazon's sales and earnings to respectively rise 22% and 47% this year, which are incredible growth figures for a 22-year-old company. Let's take a look at six of Amazon's key strengths, and why they indicate that the tech giant's best days could still be ahead of it.  Image source: Amazon. 1. The unstoppable Prime juggernaut Amazon's biggest retail weapon is Prime, its $99-a-year premium plan which bundles together discounts, free shipping options, access to Amazon Video and other digital services, and new delivery programs for food and pantry items. Major brick-and-mortar retailers like Wal-Mart have struggled to match Prime's perks. Amazon doesn't disclose how many Prime members it has, but research firm CIRP claimed that it had 63 million U.S. members last June, a 43% jump from the prior year. It also estimated that the average Prime member spent $1,200 per year, compared to just $500 for non-members. 2. Its expanding smart home ecosystem Amazon expands its Prime ecosystem into homes with Kindle tablets, Fire TV set-top boxes, and Echo smart speakers. Amazon sells many of these devices at very thin margins, but it does so to boost sales of physical and digital products while locking users into the Prime ecosystem. Amazon's intentions to dominate smart homes are clear. Its Echo speakers already help user reorder products, control smart home appliances, access streaming media services, search for information, and even connect to newer Ford vehicles. Its Dash buttons and DRS-enabled appliances also automate the reordering of consumables from Amazon -- which could eventually hurt supermarkets. 3. The inevitable automation of its logistics chain An ongoing concern about Amazon is its ability to keep shipping costs under control. Yet Amazon has already offered a clear long-term solution to the problem -- the automation of its logistics chain. Amazon's Prime Air drone. Image source: Amazon. In January, The Seattle Times reported that Amazon used 45,000 warehouse robots at 20 fulfillment centers -- marking a 50% jump from a year earlier. CNN also recently reported that preparing a single Amazon shipment required just one minute of human labor, thanks to robots and automated systems. On the delivery front, Amazon has been testing out its Prime Air drones and Prime Air planes. All this automation should cause its logistics costs to decline over the long term. 4. Its ability to disrupt multiple industries Amazon excels at disrupting multiple industries at the same time. It's chasing Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and YouTube in streaming video; hitting grocers, superstores, and apparel retailers with same-day delivery services, private brands, and brick-and-mortar stores; and challenging restaurant delivery leaders like GrubHub. Amazon might not be the market leader in these categories, but it's catching up by bundling the services into its Prime memberships. This means that the ongoing growth of Amazon's moat is forcing companies in adjacent markets to defend their businesses. 5. Expanding overseas and shuttering weaker businesses Amazon has also set its sights on high-growth e-commerce markets like India and the Middle East. It invested billions of dollars into its Indian business to challenge market leader Flipkart, and recently agreed to buy Souq.com, the market leader in the highly fragmented Middle Eastern e-commerce market. Like Netflix, Amazon is releasing original video content for its overseas markets. But unlike Netflix, Amazon can leverage its Prime ecosystem to gain more viewers -- who will hopefully become its loyal customers. 6. Amazon Web Services' untouchable lead in the cloud Amazon generates most of its revenue from its marketplace business, but most of its profits come from Amazon Web Services (AWS), the biggest cloud platform in the world. AWS achieved an annual run rate of $14 billion last quarter. The unit's revenue rose 47% annually and accounted for 8% of Amazon's top line during the quarter, but its operating income rose 60% and accounted for over half of its operating profits. The bottom line growth enables Amazon to post consistent profitability -- which seemed like a pipe dream just a few years ago. It also allows Amazon to use low-margin or loss-leading strategies to expand its Prime ecosystem. The key takeaways I previously stated that I plan to hold Amazon "forever", and I stick by that statement. There's no single company which matches Amazon's presence in e-commerce or cloud platforms, and its continued growth in both markets could crush many smaller competitors over the next few years. Therefore, taking profits might seem prudent today, but I firmly believe that Amazon's best days are still ahead. Leo Sun owns shares of Amazon and Ford.

A federal grand jury in Birmingham this week issued two separate indictments accusing the suspects of traveling to the state to commit access device fraud, Acting U.S. Attorney Robert O. Posey, and U.S. Secret Service Special Agent in Charge Michael Williams announced Friday. A two-count indictment filed in U.S. District Court charges Alexander Acosta, 27, and Yester Luis Rodriguez Duque, 34, both of Florida, with conspiracy to use, possess and traffic in counterfeit and unauthorized access devices, and with possessing 15 or more of the fraudulent cards. According to the indictment, Acosta and Duque traveled to Alabama in March to use counterfeit cards to obtain money, goods and services, and that Acosta used at least one of these cards at a Walmart in Vestavia Hills on March 15. At the time, they were in possession of 15 or more counterfeit or unauthorized access devices. In an unrelated case, the grand jury indicted Charles Antonio Rice, 27, and Hermes Chimaera-El, 35, with two counts of conspiracy to commit access device fraud in March. Additionally, Rice is charged with possessing device-making equipment on March 21. Both men are from North Carolina. Authorities say Rice and Chimaera-El obtained counterfeit access devices encoded with their own names, but with account numbers belonging to Alabama residents. The pair came to north Alabama in order to use the fraudulent cards to obtain money, goods and services. Rice had an MSRX6 Bluetooth card encoder, according to the indictment. The U.S. Secret Service investigated both cases in conjunction with its financial service investigator and the Jefferson County Regional Financial Fraud Task Force. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Robin Beardsley Mark and Erica Williamson Barnes are prosecuting the cases. The maximum penalty for conspiracy to use, possess or traffic in unauthorized or counterfeit access devices is five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. The maximum penalty for possessing 15 or more unauthorized or counterfeit access devices is 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, and the maximum penalty for possessing device-making equipment is 15 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. "The two unrelated cases indicted this week are prime examples of financial crime frequently committed through the creation and use of fraudulent debit, credit and gift cards," Posey said in a prepared statement. "We are fortunate in the Birmingham Metro Area to have the Jefferson County Regional Financial Crimes Task Force, which brings local law enforcement in the county together with the U.S. Secret Service to quickly respond to and investigate these type of crimes." "Technology has forever changed the way we do business, making every day financial transactions a prime target for fraud," Williams said, also in a statement . "The Secret Service, in conjunction with the Jefferson County Regional Financial Crimes Task Force, continues to successfully combat financial crimes in the metro area by adapting our investigative methodologies, and educating the general public."

Late Thursday, after receiving information from a tip, investigators obtained surveillance images from a Walmart in Oklahoma City from the afternoon of March 15th, showing Tad Cummins and Thomas shopping at the store. Officials said Cummins used cash to purchase various food items, but did not purchase anything else of significance. The surveillance images of Cummins and Thomas – the first obtained by investigators since the alleged kidnapping on March 13th – clearly show Tad Cummins with an altered appearance to darken his hair. The same images show Elizabeth may currently have red hair. Efforts to determine what vehicle they were using in Oklahoma remain ongoing.

Meanwhile, Thursday, the FDA shut down the Kentucky-based producer of the tainted product, Dixie Dew Products after spotting inspection violations including pipes dripping into food kettles and no hot water or soap for food handlers to wash their hands. Dixie Dew produces products for organic food companies, too, so more recalls could be coming. Food safety attorney Bill Marler, an attorney in four of the five lawsuits filed by E. coli victims in this outbreak, said in an email to the Miami Herald, “This inspection report reads far worse than the 483’s from the Peanut Corp of America (Salmonella – over 700 sick with nine deaths – 28-year prison sentence for owner) or Peter Pan (Salmonella – over 700 sick - $11 million fine). I got court orders to go into both of those plants and am working on doing the same here. What a mess.” 29 people infected with E. coli in the outbreak CDC investigation traces to the SoyNut Butter Company’s I.M. Healthy SoyNut Butter products. 24 infected people are under 18 years old. The CDC hopes the E. coli outbreak remains relatively contained. Thursday’s update put the numbers at 29 infected people in 12 states. Single cases in Florida, Illinois and Massachusetts put them on a list with Oregon (nine), California (five), Arizona (four), Washington (two), Virginia (two), Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey and Wisconsin (one each). Because E. coli can take two to three weeks to develop, these infection statistics go only until March 13. 12 people have been hospitalized. 9 have developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a type of kidney failure That’s six days after the SoyNut Butter Company recalled all its I.M. Healthy SoyNut Butter and Granola products. Last week, SoyNut Butter customer Pro Sports Line recalled over 36,000 Yogurt Peanut Crunch Bars. Last week is also when SoyNut Butter’s previously unnamed contractor, Dixie Dew Products, was revealed. It’s an arrangement less common in niche products, such as peanut allergy substitutes, than in mass marketed products. In the Peter Pan peanut butter situation Marler mentioned, the same ConAgra-made peanut butter was sold under the brands Peter Pan and Walmart Great Value. An apparent fly infestation was observed in your firm’s Quality Control and Product Development Laboratory on March 13, 2017. FDA inspection report on Dixie Dew Products facility. “While the FDA made the right decision in shutting down the Dixie Dew plant, the agency should take another step forward and reverse its policy of withholding the names and locations of stores and schools where recalled food products are sold,” U.S. Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) said in a e-mailed statement. “As we have seen with Dixie Dew, it is irresponsible and insufficient to rely on the good faith of food corporations to provide all the necessary recall information. Americans deserve to know these details to ensure their health and safety.” The FDA wouldn’t reveal Dixie Dew as the maker of the soy butter before the shut down, but inspected the food producer’s Erlanger, Kentucky, facility seven times from March 3-15. Some excerpts (the “you” in the quotes is Dixie Dew President Robert Carl): ▪ During a SoyNut Butter production run, “a clear liquid substance was observed dripping intermittently from a hole in a ceiling tile in your firm’s Soy Butter Processing Room and landing on the Processing Room floor and splashing on food manufacturing equipment below. The dripping liquid persisted throughout the duration of the production run which spanned from approximately [redacted]. According to you, the liquid was water from a leaking pipe which runs above the ceiling tiles.” ▪ “According to you and your Plant Manager, your temperature probe and chart recorder, initially engineered to verify and record [redacted] in the large mixing kettle is not functioning properly and has not been used for well over a year.” ▪ The plant manager told an inspector that SoyNut Butter left over from a production run stays in the kettle overnight or on weekends, when the kettle is shut off, and may still be there when production next restarts. ▪ The plant manager told an inspector the bulk soy oil tote used to make SoyNut Butter was never cleaned. ▪ A nozzle in the SoyNut Butter processing room used in making the product was observed laying in standing water on the floor. ▪ “There was no hot water to the hand-washing sink or to the two-compartment sink located in the SoyNut Butter processing room. According to your maintenance supervisor, the hot water tank for these sinks has been out of repair for two years. Additionally, the hand soap dispenser for the hand sink was not operable.” ▪ “You and your Plant Manager have stated you have not disassembled any SoyNut Butter processing equipment and all associated piping for cleaning and sanitizing since December of 2015.” ▪ “...an opened [redacted] bag in box [redacted] product in your firm’s walk-in cooler was observed with an apparent 3-inch diameter rodent defiled marking that penetrated the box and the product. Additionally, apparent mold was growing on the surface of the butter.” ▪ “An apparent fly infestation was observed in your firm’s Quality Control and Product Development Laboratory on March 13, 2017. Small, apparent flies and larvae, too numerous to count, were inside an unplugged chest freezer...The small apparent flies were observed along the laboratory counters and flying throughout the laboratory.” The FDA issued a Suspension of Food Facility Registration Order Tuesday. Thursday’s announcement said, “The Suspension Order applies to the entire facility. While the order is in effect, no food product may leave the facility for sale or distribution. The FDA will reinstate Dixie Dew’s food facility registration only when the agency determines that adequate grounds do not exist to continue the suspension of registration.” David J.

Mar 31 More from Joseph N. DiStefano Arrow icon With Amazon shutting down Quidsi, operator of Soaps.com, Diapers.com and other sites the online-shopping giant bought for $545 million in 2011, what happens to Quidsi's 1.3 million square foot "fulfillment center" in Goldsboro, Covington Township, south of Scranton? "They're still operating," says Andy Skrip, vice president of the Scranton chamber of commerce. Quidsi employs around 275 at the warehouse, which has more floor space than Comcast headquarters, the tallest tower in Philadelphia. The warehouse was originally built for Circuit City, the electronics-store chain, which went bankrupt in the 2008 recession, before it could be occupied. Quidsi's Jersey City headquarters is laying off 261, Amazon told New Jersey in a federal WARN Act notice. Quidsi also has warehouses in the Kansas City area and Nevada. Amazon plans to merge its customers into its larger site. Quidsi officials in Jersey City and Gouldsboro didn't immediately return calls. Amazon has 12 other warehouses across Pennsylvania. The state gave Amazon hundreds of millions of dollars in sales-tax forgiveness to build more "fulfillment centers" in the state, and last year accepted $22.5 million more in state aid in exchange for its promise to add 5,000 jobs, pushing its total above 13,000, by 2019. The Quidsi plant was excluded from that deal, so Amazon could close it without jeopardizing its state cash -- though it's a drop in the bucket for a firm whose sales are approaching $4 billion a week. After selling Quidsi, cofounder Marc Lore, a Dickinson College graduate, went on to form Jet.com, which he sold to Walmart Stores last year for $3 billion. Lore now runs Walmart's e-commerce division, which after its late start has been competing aggressively with Amazon. Read more by Joseph N.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement MSI launches Trident 3 VR-ready, console-sized gaming PC 03/29/2017 at 4:00 PM by Brad Linder 7 Comments MSI is following up last year’s Trident gaming computer with a new model called the Trident 3. Like its predecessor, the new model is about the size of an Xbox or PlayStation game console, but under the hood it’s a full-fledged gaming PC. What’s new is that the Trident 3 swaps has an Intel Kaby Lake CPU rather than Skylake. It’s available from retailers including Amazon, B&H, Newegg and Walmart for around $900 and up, depending on the configuration. And this week MSI unveiled a new Trident 3 Arctic white model for folks looking for something a bit brighter than the standard black version. The Arctic model features an Intel Core i7-7700 quad-core processor, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 graphics, 16GB of RAM, a 256GB solid state drive, and a 1TB 7200RPM hard drive. That model should be available in April for $1500. Looking for a cheaper option? MSI’s Trident 3 with a black case has the same basic design, but that model has NVIDIA GeForce 1060 graphics and comes in several different configurations: Core i5-7400/8GB/1TB HDD for $900 Core i7-7700/8GB/128GB SSD + 1TB HDD for $1100 Core i7-7700/16GB/256GB SSD + 1TB HDD for $1300   Both the Trident 3 and the Trident 3 Arctic are the same size. The computer’s case measures about 13.6″ x 9.2″ x 2.8″ and the PC features a USB 3.1 Type-C port, three full-sized USB 3.1 ports, 4 USB 2.0 ports, two HDMI outputs and one HDMI input, Gigabit Ethernet, WiFi, and Bluetooth. via BetaNews Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 7 Comments on "MSI launches Trident 3 VR-ready, console-sized gaming PC" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Member zdanee Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

Elizabeth is the subject of a nationwide Endangered Child Alert. Elizabeth has been missing since March 13th from her home town of Columbia, Tenn. Tad Cummins, her suspected kidnapper, was a teacher at Elizabeth's school. Please enable Javascript to watch this video The confirmed sighting of Elizabeth has given her family hope. "First, it was just really good to see her, to see another picture of her was really good. And the second thing I realized, this is more useful for law enforcement looking for her because this is the first piece of proof we have that actually he did abduct her and the two of them are travelling together," said Elizabeth's father Anthony Thomas. "If anybody sees anything don't waste any time. Call 911, they can get on the scene faster. Then call TBI. Then post it on social media," said Anthony Thomas. The pictures released by the TBI are from a Walmart on East I-240 Service Road in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. This was the afternoon of March 15th, just two days after they left Columbia. The pictures show Cummins and Elizabeth shopping at the store. The TBI says Cummins used cash to purchase various food items, but didn't buy anything else of significance.

They clearly show Cummins with an altered appearance - darker hair. Elizabeth appears to have red hair, and she wasn't wearing her glasses.

Crime U.S. Confirmed Amber Alert Sighting: Tad Cummins and Elizabeth Thomas were in Oklahoma City on March 15th March 31, 2017 0 1458 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has confirmed a sighting of the 15-year-old victim in an ongoing Amber Alert, along with the 50-year-old man believed to have kidnapped her earlier this month. Late Thursday, after receiving information from a tip, investigators obtained surveillance images from a Walmart on East I-240 Service Road in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma from the afternoon of March 15th, showing Tad Cummins and Elizabeth Thomas shopping at the store. Cummins used cash to purchase various food items, but did not purchase anything else of significance. The surveillance images of Cummins and Thomas – the first obtained by investigators since the alleged kidnapping on March 13th – clearly show Tad Cummins with an altered appearance to darken his hair. The same images show Elizabeth may currently have red hair. Efforts to determine what vehicle they were traveling in remain ongoing. Thomas, 15, disappeared on Monday, March 13th and is believed to have been kidnapped by 50-year-old Tad Cummins, a former teacher at her school in Maury County, Tennessee. The school district in Maury County terminated Cummins in the wake of an ongoing investigation into alleged inappropriate contact he had with Thomas at the school earlier this year. [RELATED: TBI: Amber Alert Suspect Googled Teen Marriage, Vehicle Tracking] Thomas is a 15-year-old white female, with hazel eyes, stands 5’0” and weighs 120 pounds. She was last seen wearing a flannel shirt and black leggings. Cummins is a white male, who stands 6’0”, weighs approximately 200 pounds, and has brown hair and eyes. He is believe to be armed with two handguns and driving a silver Nissan Rogue with Tennessee tag 976-ZPT. A warrant has been issued for Cummins for Sexual Contact with a Minor and Aggravated Kidnapping. On Friday, the TBI added him to the state’s ‘Top 10 Most Wanted’ list. There is a $1,000 reward for information leading to his capture. As of this morning, the TBI received more than 1,200 tips from across the country. The TBI would urge the public to remain vigilant and report any information that may prove beneficial in the ongoing search to 1-800-TBI-FIND. If you spot the vehicle and can verify the license plate to be TN 976-ZPT, call 911 immediately.

Matt Bevin briefly addressed the Kentucky Senate shortly before the General Assembly ended its 2017 legislative session on Thursday, March 30, 2017. Jack Brammer jbrammer@herald-leader.com The Kentucky House of Representatives voted on Thursday, March 30, 2017, on whether to concur with changes the Senate had made to its bills. jcheves@herald-leader.com John Cheves Speaker Jeff Hoover, R-Jamestown, presided over the Kentucky House of Representatives on Thursday, March 30, 2017. jcheves@herald-leader.com John Cheves 1 of 3 i By John Cheves, Daniel Desrochers and Jack Brammer jcheves@herald-leader.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Frankfort The Kentucky General Assembly ended its 2017 session late Thursday by approving a final batch of mostly low-profile bills and gubernatorial appointments, although Republicans and Democrats argued over measures to interfere in zoning lawsuits and limit the availability of prescription painkillers. As the clock struck midnight and the session ended, an amended version of House Bill 281, which would have reduced the power of Attorney General Andy Beshear in a couple of ways, died for a lack of action on the House floor. The Senate passed it earlier in the evening. One section of the bill would have capped at $20 million the contingency fees that Beshear could agree to pay outside lawyers who represent the state in complex litigation against deep-pocketed plaintiffs. Another would have eliminated his right to represent the state in amicus, or “friend of the court,” briefs filed in other parties’ lawsuits, giving that privilege to the governor instead. Beshear, a Democrat and frequent opponent of Republican Gov. Matt Bevin, called the move a “power grab” and threatened to challenge it in court. There simply wasn’t time to move on HB 281, House Speaker Jeff Hoover told reporters later. Most of the session’s hottest issues — including conservative victories on charter schools, abortion restrictions, religious expression and changes to labor and wage law — had been sent to Bevin for his signature long before Thursday. Republican lawmakers delivered on the 2016 campaign speeches that convinced voters to hand them control of the state House and Senate, said Hoover, R-Jamestown. “It’s been a very good session for the people of Kentucky,” Hoover said. “We made some promises in November and we believe we’ve kept those promises on policies that are good for Kentucky’s business climate, for the Kentucky economy, and we feel really good about this session,” he said. “There have been more significant pieces of legislation passed in this short 30-day session than in any session, even the longer sessions in anyone’s memory.” Among the bills sent to the governor’s desk Thursday: ▪  House Bill 72 will require an appeal bond to be posted if a neighborhood association or other party appeals a rezoning decision from circuit court to the Kentucky Court of Appeals. The sponsor, Rep. Jerry Miller, R-Louisville, said he wants to prevent people from thwarting future economic development projects, like a Wal-Mart that had tried to open in West Louisville until residents legally challenged it. However, Democratic lawmakers said requiring bonds of up to $250,000 would make it impossible for citizens to challenge developers in court. “Posting a bond isn’t the American way. It limits average people’s access to the courts,” said Rep. Chris Harris, D-Forest Hills. “What we’re doing here, Mr. Speaker, is chipping away at the constitutional rights of our constituents.” A free conference committee of lawmakers negotiated a new version of HB 72 that would exempt anyone who is challenging the construction or expansion of a landfill. Some constituents of Senate Majority Leader Damon Thayer, R-Georgetown, are fighting the expansion of a Scott County landfill in his district. ▪  House Bill 206 will allow high school seniors who maintain a 2.5 or better grade point average to use state lottery funds for apprenticeships in skilled trades, such as electricians and plumbers. This lottery money is currently only available for college costs. ▪  House Bill 333 will limit doctors to writing a three-day prescription for opioid painkillers for patients with acute pain. It allows for higher penalties for trafficking in heroin or fentanyl, a powerful opioid that is similar to morphine but far more powerful. Senate Minority Leader Ray Jones, D-Pikeville, protested that Kentucky lawmakers should not adopt tighter limits on painkiller prescriptions without hearing testimony from medical authorities. But Senate President Robert Stivers said Kentucky is in the grip of an addiction epidemic, and his own hometown of Manchester is one of the communities awash in pain pills. ▪  House Bill 330 will refinance the debt of the Yum! Center in Louisville through 30-year bonds and add 25 years to the length of a state-approved tax increment financing plan for the arena, taking it to 2054. Metro Louisville and the University of Louisville, which uses the Yum! Center for men’s basketball games, will be expected to step up and help with the arena’s higher-than-anticipated revenue needs as well, said Scott Brinkman, secretary of the governor’s executive cabinet. ▪  House Bill 277 eliminates anti-nepotism rules for school board members who have aunts, uncles, sons-in-law or daughters-in-law working for their school districts. Any bills approved by the lawmakers this week can be vetoed by Bevin, with no opportunity for the legislature to override the vetoes. There was at least one dust-up between the two GOP-controlled chambers. State Rep. David Meade yanked from further action a resolution that he had sponsored to create a task force to study Kentucky’s adoption and foster care programs. The reason? The Senate had replaced his language with a so-called “Christmas tree,” making it a vehicle loaded down with resolutions calling for legislative studies of everything from nepotism rules in school districts to the attorney general’s office. Meade, R-Stanford, said the Senate took “good legislation and makes it bad.” House Bill 296, which would rework the state’s workers’ compensation program, was left hanging in a Senate committee as labor unions lobbied aggressively against it. The workers comp bill stalled in large part because of a provision that would allow employers to stop paying benefits after 15 years for partial disabilities. The bill would exempt some injuries, such as loss of a limb, hearing, eye or teeth, from the 15-year cap, but it still drew the ire of police and firefighter unions. In a last-minute measure, House Bill 377, the General Assembly bailed out the coal industry from having to pay rising costs on black lung claims. The bill’s new language shifts responsibility for paying out existing claims from the Coal Workers Pneumoconiosis Fund to Kentucky Employers’ Mutual Insurance. KEMI would charge coal companies last year’s lower assessments to pay the claims as the black-lung fund is phased out. Stivers said the bill would have no effect on benefits paid to coal workers. He said the bill is necessary to combat rising costs as the number of coal companies in Kentucky has declined. “I don’t know of anyone that is in the system that is opposed to this,” Stivers said.

Consider Dollar Tree Stores and AutoZone. Brian Feroldi (TMFTypeoh) Mar 31, 2017 at 11:08AM The S&P 500 may be trading near its all-time high, but that doesn't mean that every stock is participating in the prosperity. Dollar Tree Stores (NASDAQ:DLTR) and AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) are both high-quality retailers that have been left out of the recent rally. Here's why opportunistic investors might want to pick up a few shares while they still trade at a discount. Image Source: Getty Images. The other retail disrupter Most investors assume that big-box retailers like Wal-Mart and Target have been suffering as of late because of e-commerce companies like Amazon.com. While Amazon has certainly been stealing customers away from these low-cost retailers, ultra-discount chain stores such as Dollar Tree have also been a major thorn in their side. One reason is that dollar stores require much smaller footprints, and thus can be easily placed in convenient locations in low-income neighborhoods. Since residents of those areas tend to be price-sensitive to the cost of fuel, they have been increasingly willing to shop at their local dollar store. This fact has allowed companies like Dollar Tree to gobble up market share at the low end of the space for years. Last quarter, Dollar Tree's comp sales grew by 1.2%, which is a decent result given the tough retail environment. This suggests that the company's convenience and value strategy continues to resonate with customers. Looking ahead, Dollar Tree has a few growth levers in place that should help to move its bottom line forward. These include the promised synergies from its recently completed takeover of Family Dollar. This transaction transformed this company into the largest dollar store chain in the U.S., and management is targeting $300 million in annual merger-related savings. Add in the expectation of slow and steady market share gains, and Dollar Tree's bottom line looks poised for growth.  Analysts believe that Dollar Tree will be able to advance its EPS by more than 13% annually over the next five years. Despite the bullish forecast, Dollar Tree's shares are currently down more than 22% from their recent highs, due to less-than-hoped-for fourth-quarter sales growth and concerns about the impact of possible changes to corporate tax laws. While potential tax changes are worth keeping an eye on, Dollar Tree stands to benefit from the continued secular shift away from big-box retailers. If it does, then picking up shares now could prove to be a profit-friendly move. AutoZone hits a pothole Did you know that the average light vehicle in the U.S. is more than 11.5 years old? This figure has been creeping higher for years thanks to improvements in vehicle quality, which makes consumers more willing to hang on to their cars or trucks. But that, in turn, drives increased demand for repair shops and auto parts retailers. One prime beneficiary of this trend is AutoZone. The company has showered investors with huge returns thanks to the flawless execution of its simple, but effective, growth strategy. It has placed an emphasis on providing both consumers and repair shops with great customer service so they can quickly get the parts they need. This has led to steady gains in comparable-store sales and margins, both of which have driven net income higher. Boosted by its habit of repurchasing shares, AutoZone was able to report 41 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth. Reflecting that, the company's stock has been a home run. AZO Normalized Diluted EPS (TTM) data by YCharts Unfortunately, that incredible earnings streak recently came to an end. In its most recent quarter, AutoZone reported that same-store sales were flat, and that EPS only grew by 8.8%. Management said the disappointing result was driven by delayed tax refunds and margin headwinds from investments in its supply chain. However, the company's commercial business grew by 7.2% and its "buy online pick-up in store" service posted growth of 20%. Taken as a whole, the results suggest that this earnings blip was a one-time issue as opposed to the start of a long-term trend.  Despite the earnings speed bump, management still believes that it can drive double-digit EPS growth in the years ahead. Analysts appear to agree, and are currently projecting 11% annualized bottom-line growth over the next five years. Despite this potential, the recent earnings report drove AutoZone's stock down more than 12% from its 52-week high. Shares are now trading for less than 15 times forward earnings, which I think is a bargain for such a high-quality business.  Brian Feroldi owns shares of Amazon.

The untold story of “The Burning Bed” The woman who inspired the “The Burning Bed” book and movie has died in The Shoals. Though her story changed domestic violence laws nationwide, few locals actually knew her life story. Granddaughter Molly Wilson told WHNT News 19 that Francine Hughes endured a living hell for more than a decade. Abused by her first husband, Hughes reached a desperate point in her life. There were no laws preventing domestic violence in Michigan during the 1970s, so Hughes took matters into her own hands. She took her husband’s life by dousing him with gasoline and setting his bed on fire. Hughes sought refuge after her acquittal; remarrying and moving to The Shoals. For 35 years, very few people truly knew who Francine Wilson really was, or the powerful legacy she leaves behind in domestic violence prevention. “She never wanted anybody to treat her differently because of it,” explained Molly Wilson, one of Francine’s granddaughters. Here’s even more of her story… Please enable Javascript to watch this video I-85's fiery collapse An elevated section of northbound Interstate 85, a major North-South artery for the Southeast, collapsed Thursday evening in Atlanta after a massive fire. The video is well, nuts. Please enable Javascript to watch this video If you're driving through Atlanta anytime soon, you'll definitely want to avoid the area. DeSoto drop Speaking of crazy video, one of WHNT News 19's viewers Gary Parker, sent us this clip of a kayaker going over a roaring DeSoto Falls. While it's thrilling to watch, experienced paddlers warn this is very risky and should not be attempted by recreational paddlers. Wild turkey at Walmart Walmart is known for welcoming people from all walks of life, and recently, someone new has taken advantage of that hospitality. A wild turkey has been seen the past few days trotting around the Walmart parking lot off of Winchester Road. “Well first thing that comes through is, well, Thanksgiving came early," Walmart customer Roger Lawrence said. "Second thing that you think of is safety, we don’t want that to come into play with drivers coming through. Third thing is the surprise element of it. What is a turkey doing here, this isn’t it’s natural habitat, and then you have to laugh about it.” Please enable Javascript to watch this video Crayola cuts a crayon Crayola's cutting a classic color out of its 24-pack!

Bloomberg reports that Apple stands with “many of America’s biggest corporations” such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Wal-Mart in standing by their earlier promises to address climate change issues, including switching to clean energy sources and renewable energy supplies. Following an order signed by President Trump earlier this week essentially reversing Obama’s Clean Power Plan, Apple issued a joint statement along with Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, expressing support for the original policies We believe that strong clean energy and climate policies, like the Clean Power Plan, can make renewable energy supplies more robust and address the serious threat of climate change while also supporting American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth. Apple’s continued commitment to the spirit of the Clean Power Plan comes as little surprise as the company has long set goals to become a clean energy company globally, issuing supplier environmental responsibility reports annually, and having reached a point where over 93 percent of its operations worldwide are already powered by renewable energy, and in fact 100 percent renewable energy being used in 23 countries, including the United States, as well as working to dramatically reduce its carbon footprint through more efficient manufacturing processes.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 31 March 2017 by Military News Riata Capital Group Announces Formation of Acuity Eyecare Acquires Three Regional Eyecare Groups - St. Louis-based Crown Vision Center, Pittsburgh-based Eyetique, and Quincy, IL-based International Eyecare Center DALLAS, March 31, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Riata Capital Group ("Riata") today announced the formation of Acuity Eyecare Holdings ("Acuity" or the "Company"), a company that will own and operate leading North American eyecare groups and optometry practices. Acuity launches with a strong platform following the simultaneous acquisition of three regional eyecare groups: Crown Vision Center, based in St. Louis, which was ranked by Vision Monday as the 26th largest eyecare group in the United States based on locations; Eyetique, based in Pittsburgh, which was ranked the 30th largest eyecare group in the United States based on locations; and International Eyecare Center, based in Quincy, Illinois, which serves rural communities in Missouri, Illinois and Iowa. Acuity begins operations with 61 locations across five states. Acuity will also own a large, full-service digital lab operation, The First Look Lab, that is located just outside of St. Louis. Riata intends to expand Acuity into a market-leading eyecare platform through the acquisition of additional regional eyecare groups and independent eyecare professionals. The formation of Acuity is the second platform investment of the Riata principals in the eyecare sector. From 2011 to 2015, certain of the principals organized and led the very successful acquisition of Vision Source, a market-leading network of independent optometry practices across the United States. Under the leadership of a very seasoned management team, Vision Source grew from 2,300 to over 3,150 locations, making its network of member optometrists second only to Walmart in terms of number of locations. Vision Source was sold to Essilor USA in late 2015, generating strong returns for its investors. Jeff Fronterhouse, Co-Managing Partner of Riata, said, "We are excited to build upon our strong network of relationships, experience, and track record in the eyecare industry to create Acuity Eyecare. We understand the pressures, as well as the opportunities, for optometrists as the industry continues to evolve. As such, we see the formation of larger and vertically integrated corporate entities leading some smaller and mid-sized providers to consider partnering with groups like Acuity that can provide capable business, financial, and commercial support, allowing optometrists and their staffs to focus on meeting the eyecare and product needs of their patients." Mr. Fronterhouse continued, "The combination of these three successful eyecare groups, that together have experienced higher rates of sales growth than the overall market, provides Acuity with a strong initial base of operations in the Midwest region. Our focus going forward will be to support these groups, as well as others that join Acuity, with the tools and resources necessary to provide their patients with full-scope professional eyecare and the highest quality product assortment and value." Acuity is led by an experienced and successful management team, including Chief Executive Officer Matt Matthews, the former CEO of Crown Vision; Chief Financial Officer Doug Shepard, the former CFO of Eye Care Centers of America, Chief Merchandising Officer George Gebhardt, the former CMO of Visionworks, Vice President of Corporate Development Bret Davis, the former SVP of Business Development for Vision Source; and other senior executives from the leadership teams of Crown Vision, Eyetique and International Eyecare. Additionally, Acuity has assembled a board of directors consisting of experienced and very successful executives from the industry that will bring valuable insight as Acuity looks to expand. Mr. Matthews noted, "We are excited to be a part of the Acuity platform, which is well-positioned for success with the support of Riata, an experienced capital partner that brings a deep set of industry relationships. In addition to the existing leadership teams at each of the three businesses, we have an impressive team at Acuity that brings substantial experience in important areas including medical eyecare, digital manufacturing and lab management, merchandising, supply chain, finance, and IT. We look forward to the exciting growth opportunities ahead for Acuity." Glenn Askew, a Riata Partner, commented, "Acuity is well-positioned for growth, and we will look to further expand the Company's footprint in the Midwest and other regions organically and through the acquisition of additional market-leading eyecare groups and independent optometrists in attractive markets." In connection with the transaction, HPC Puckett & Co. provided financial advice to Crown Vision Center, Eyetique and International Eyecare Center.

Mcfarlane Toys kotakucore variants retailer exclusives .repaints 57 5 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink McFarlane Toys really lucked out with the Destiny license. Not only does it get to make some cool figures and replica weapons, with Destiny’s armor shader system the repaint potential is massive. Here are four retailer-exclusive variants dropping in July. Advertisement For reference, here are the original paint jobs for the Hunter, Warlock and Titan figures announced by McFarlane Toys during the New York Toy Fair earlier this year. For the three of the four retailer exclusives, which should be available in July for $19.99, McFarlane not only swapped colors, they swapped out helmets as well. Advertisement Warlock fans will be able to pick up the black and orange Hallow Shader variant figure at GameStop. He’s wearing the latest in Light Beyond Nemesis helmet technology. Highly detailed sculpt of the Warlock modeled from in-game assets. Sculpted figure features the Hollow Shader, complete with Light Beyond Nemesis Helmet. Figure comes with the Touch of Malice Scout Rifle and Ice Breaker Sniper Rifle. Fully customizable figure with 14+ points of articulation for dynamic posing. Figure comes in window boxed collector packaging and featured on a stylized Destiny branded display base. GameStop is also accepting preorders for the replica Gjallarhorn, which can be yours for only $169.99. Walmart gets the short end of the stick. The Million Million Shader Hunter figure is a straight-up recolor of the main Hunter fig, with the same old face. Take that, Walmart. Highly detailed sculpt of the Hunter modeled from in-game assets. Sculpted figure features the Million Million Shader, Accessories include Thorn Hand Cannon and Bolt-Caster Sword, Fully customizable figure with 14+ points of articulation for dynamic posing, Figure comes in window boxed collector packaging and featured on a stylized Destiny branded display base, Meanwhile, at Walgreens (the other Walstore), the Blacksmith Shader Hunter not only looks good, it also gets to try on the Celestial Nighthawk helmet for size. Highly detailed sculpt of the Hunter modeled from in-game assets. Sculpted figure features the Blacksmith Shader, complete with Celestial Nighthawk Helmet. Figure comes with the Thorn hand cannon and Invective Shotgun. Fully customizable figure with 14+ points of articulation for dynamic posing. Figure comes in window boxed collector packaging and featured on a stylized Destiny branded display base. Bye far the best of the four comes from Target. I do not play a Titan, but damn if the Amduat Ink Shader Titan doesn’t make me want to pound the ground. It’s like Iron Man and a Roman legionnaire had sex, and then Tony Stark gave him this armor as thanks. Highly detailed sculpt of the Titan modeled from in-game assets. Sculpted figure features the Amduat Ink Shader, complete with Helm of Saint-14 Helmet. Figure comes with the iconic Gjallarhorn Rocket Launcher and Hung Jury Scout Rifle. Fully customizable figure with 14+ points of articulation for dynamic posing. Figure comes in window boxed collector packaging and featured on a stylized Destiny branded display base.

What do Amazon’s rumored AR efforts mean for the future of brick-and-mortar shopping? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Mar 31, 2017 at 9:26AM Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) could be developing augmented reality (or AR) features for its own chain of homewares stores, according to The New York Times. The report, which cites a source "briefed in the discussions," indicates that shoppers at Amazon's brick-and-mortar homewares stores could use devices or apps to "project" home furnishings into digital images of their actual living rooms. This idea isn't really new. Back in 2013, IKEA launched an AR app which let customers project furniture into their living rooms via a smartphone camera. Last year, home improvement retailer Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) installed Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) HoloLens mixed reality headset at select stores to let shoppers design virtual rooms. Image source: Getty Images. However, Amazon's AR plans coincide with its recent moves into the brick-and-mortar space with test bookstores, grocery stores, and now rumored homewares stores. Let's see what that push means for Amazon, and how it could boost demand for Microsoft's HoloLens and holographic apps. What is Amazon up to? Amazon's brick-and-mortar expansion might seem counterproductive, since its online marketplace is forcing many brick-and-mortar retailers to shutter stores and invest more heavily in e-commerce. However, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) has proven that some customers still prefer placing orders online and picking them up immediately to avoid wait times and shipping fees. To cut overhead costs, Amazon's grocery store model uses a "just walk out" system called Amazon Go. The store tracks the items taken by the customer and charges their Amazon accounts once they walk out -- eliminating the need for checkout lines and cashiers. Its bookstores offer special discounts to Prime members, and offers self-checkout via the Amazon app. For the rumored homewares push, the idea will likely be the same -- to offer self-checkout for smaller items, delivery for larger items, and discounts for Prime members. Assuming that you have pictures of your living room, you can potentially project the home furnishings into your home like the IKEA app. Since these brick-and-mortar stores all give preferential treatment to Prime members, that expansion can boost the growth of the Prime ecosystem. Last June, research firm CIRP estimated that Amazon had 63 million Prime members in the U.S., a 19 million increase from a year earlier. It also estimated that the average Prime member spent $1,200 annually at Amazon, while non-members spent just $500. Making sense of Amazon's AR investments This isn't Amazon's first move into the AR market. However, its previous moves have been all over the map. In late 2015, it patented an AR projection system, similar to Microsoft's IllumiRoom, which "transformed" living rooms into completely different, interactive environments. For example, a user could theoretically tap the wall and turn it into a TV screen, or tap the desk to open an e-book. Last year, Amazon offered jobs for a virtual reality team. It didn't say much about the team's goals, except that it would focus on a platform for "immersive storytelling". Analysts and investors speculated that Amazon could apply VR to games on the Fire TV, or add VR viewing options to Amazon Video. However, the recent report about AR homewares indicates that the team might actually be developing new AR features for the Amazon app to enhance the shopping experience at its brick-and-mortar stores. What does this mean for Microsoft and the AR market? Amazon's rumored AR app or homewares stores might never see the light of day, since the company hasn't publicly said anything about them yet. But Amazon's interest might get other retailers interested in using AR tools in brick-and-mortar stores. A HoloLens demo at Lowe's. Image source: Lowe's. That would be great news for Microsoft, since the HoloLens is the most mature "mixed reality" headset today. The upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update, which will add easy-to-use holographic tools for developers, could also make it much easier for retailers to build custom apps for the HoloLens without Microsoft's help. This wouldn't only apply to big box retailers like Lowe's -- Volvo is also using the HoloLens in dealerships to let customers virtually view cars which aren't in stock. Is augmented reality the next big thing? It's hard to tell if Amazon and Microsoft's early AR moves into the retail space will ignite a major shift in how stores showcase their products. However, tech M&A advisory firm Digi-Capital estimates that the AR market will grow from nearly nothing today to $90 billion by 2020, with much of that growth generated by sales of AR hardware, e-commerce uses, and enterprise applications. If companies like Amazon and Microsoft lead this charge, we could see mainstream interest in AR evolve beyond early efforts like Google Glass and Pokemon Go toward shopping apps. That shift could blur the lines between "showrooming" and online purchases, which could help tech giants like Amazon straddle both markets.

ROX jumped 13.24% today to $1.54 per share after the company announced that it increased their ownership in Gosling-Castle Partners Inc. (GCP) by another 20.1%. Gosling-Castle holds the exclusive long-term rights to export and distribute Gosling Rum and Gosling Stormy Ginger Beer for all countries other than Bermuda. Castle Brands owns 80.1% of GCP after the transaction, and extended its export and distribution agreement through March 2030, with ten-year renewal terms after that. „We look forward to working even more closely with Malcolm Gosling and the Gosling family to build the prominence of the iconic Goslings brands,” said John Glover, Executive Vice President of Castle Brands. Castle Brands is a New York-based company that develops, markets, imports, and sells alcohol products in the U.S. and internationally. The company’s stock has been on the rise since it agreed to supply Gosling products to all Wal-Mart WMT locationsin the U.S. The stock increased 52% since the deal was announced on Feb. 27, 2017, from $0.73 per share to $1.54 per share. While these deals significantly benefit Castle Brands, the company’s place in the market stays the same. More work still needs to be done before Castle Brands can compete with giants in the industry like Anheuser-Busch InBev BUD , Molson Coors Brewing TAP , Brown-Forman Corporation BF.B and Boston Beer SAM , which consume the majority of the market share.

A number of big-name advertisers suspended ads on YouTube last week and the week before after discovering their ads were making money for videos containing hate speech or supporting terrorism. Google has responded by promising greater transparency and saying it will be more aggressive in ensuring brand safety of ad placements. “If you’re seeing fluctuations in your revenue over the next few weeks, it may be because we’re fine tuning our ads systems to address these concerns,” reads a YouTube community manager post from Thursday. The changes stem from tweaks to the ads system, rather than any revenue loss that might have come after advertisers pulled their business, according to a source close to the situation. YouTube could lose $750 million in revenue this year over advertisers halting business, according to analyst firm Nomura Instinet. Some YouTube creators appear to have lost ad revenue altogether, which the post addresses: “If you think your video was demonetized in error, request an appeal by clicking on the yellow $ icon next to the video in Video Manager.” For creators, the changes to YouTube’s advertising system has caused confusion. The person behind popular YouTube channel “DramaAlert,” which has 1.8 million subscribers, tweeted Friday — incorrectly — that YouTube had stopped showing advertising on channels with fewer than 25,000 subscribers. This is not correct, according to Google. Numerous Twitter users responded to the tweet, saying their channels still had ads. Some, however, did complain about declines in revenue. It’s not a new thing for YouTube creators to raise concerns about inconsistencies on the platform. Creators of activist channels, including one devoted to sharing stories of abuse of women and another run by a transgender activist, have complained of videos they said follow guidelines nonetheless losing ads. @KEEMSTAR I've got 15K and I have ads.

In 2015, Antonia made a permanent mark in the second amendment community, when she became the Southwest Regional Director for Students for Concealed Carry on Campus(SCCC), where she advocated for the passing and successful implementation of the concealed carry on campus in Texas law known as, “campus carry.” The National Rifle Association (NRA) took notice of her activism and had her star in one of their “Freedom’s Safest Place” commercials, a national campaign that highlights the diversity of NRA members. A current graduate student at the University of Texas at Dallas, Antonia shows no signs of slowing down. https://antoniaokafor.com/about/ Leader Spotlight: Antonia Okafor Tell us a little bit about yourself and how you became involved in NeW? I am a current Public Affairs graduate student at The University of Texas at Dallas. I earned my bachelors degree at UT Dallas as well in 2013. I worked as a field representative for Greg Abbott for Texas Governor Campaign in 2014 and was a Running Start/Walmart Star Fellow in Senator Kelly Ayotte’s DC office last year. In January of this year, I was sworn in as Precinct Chair of my local neighborhood precinct. I hope to run for office in the future. I became involved with NeW after meeting President Karin Agness last year while interning in DC. She was speaking at a Leadership Institute Women in Leadership training and spoke about founding NeW. A couple of months ago, I decided to start a chapter at my university and currently serve as the President of that chapter. What made you want to start a NeW chapter? Although my school has a couple of groups for women, all of them are focused on the radical feminist movement. There was no safe space for women with conservative values and beliefs, other than at college bible study. But even then, politics is not usually shared in those spaces. I wanted there to be a variety of voices when it came to women in politics and leadership. What advice do you have for other women on campus who may want to start a NeW chapter? Be prepared for vocal opposition from your peers and your school. Conservative issues are usually not popular on college campuses. But cling to your conservative community, men and women alike, and stand strong and unified together. Remember, unlike the feminist movement that brings men down, conservative women believe that men are just as pivotal in uplifting women. Congratulations on your nomination for Next Political Rising Star Award at Running Start’s Young Women to Watch Awards. Can you describe what this award entails and how you became nominated? The Next Political Rising Star Award is a part of Running Start’s Annual Young Women to Watch Awards. The title comes with a $ 5000 grant that will go towards a nonpartisan project of my choosing. If I am awarded the prize, I will put it as seed money for a nonprofit organization that I will start. The nonprofit will equip passionate, driven high school girls who aspire to go to top universities, graduate with little to no debt and pursue public office. This will be done through mentorship, college prep resources and financial literacy education. In order to get to the finalist position, I was selected from many other applications to be one of 10 semifinalists in February to compete for the finalist round. We all collected signatures, online votes and campaigned for support. Those with the highest numbers earned their way to the last round. On April 21st, Tuesday evening, an audience of over 250 will vote for the winner. The other two finalists will receive $ 500 and the Alumna in Action Award. What advice do you have for other women who may want to get involved in the political nonprofit sphere? My advice is to follow the goals of NeW: Network, Enlighten and Women. Network by taking as many opportunities as possible to learn about your community, its’ needs and how you as an individual can provide solutions. That all begins by talking to people and building relationships. Enlighten-take the knowledge you have gained through your personal education, work and life experience and share that knowledge with others. Women-women are not single issue voters, we don’t believe empowerment is reserved for the Democrat party and we certainly do not all believe in the War on Women. Be an ambassador for the diversity of thought among all female organizations. Convey to the world the power of a conservative woman. And in whatever you do, do it with purpose and passion. https://enlightenedwomen.org/leader-spotlight-antonia-okafor/ What do you think? Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

America already has one of the biggest gun deaths in the developed world. Massachusetts is probably the only outlier in the gun violence stakes in the US due to tough gun laws. In general, American deaths per year are 3 times the death rates for countries already developed. Note gun deaths also includes suicide, violence, mishandling, etc. It's no wonder, death can visit them faster than a bullet train takes to reach its destination. 5 Likes Re: Antonia Okafor Taking America's Political Scene By Storm by ElsonMorali: 8:26am On Mar 31 paschu: You sure have a point there.

You are thinking that way because you're probably a decent person. Can you make the same claim for others on the same campus? Some are frustrated and want to take it out on others, others are from dysfunctional homes and wouldn't mind killing others If only to get the attention they have been denied at home. And so many cases of unstable minds. Placing guns in their hands doesn't make any sense at all.

Not everybody is stable enough to handle the responsibility that comes with the freedom to carry weapons legally. But that's also the reason guns are hardly sold to every dick and harry in the US. I'm aware that there's a measure of background check that goes into play before a gun is purchased, at least in some states. So, rather than banning guns on campuses (a rule the nut jobs will flout anyway throug illegal gun rings) why not use legislation to ensure that most of those mentally unfit people and minors cannot purchase gun in the open market?

But it does not stop bad people from procuring guns. If it did, we would not have armed robbers and other terribly armed anti-social groups. Thus a blanket ban on gun simply gives the bad guys a monopoly on violence; and makes the good people weak, vulnerable and cut off from self-defence.

Baker, Martin Feldstein, Ted Halstead, and Greg Mankiw Courtesy Image Capture-Climate Leadership Council-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-brG1mt8sD4 / https://www.clcouncil.org/ Carbon taxes are a seemingly simple way to deal with the climate crisis. As the price of fossil fuels goes up, consumption goes down.   But fears of negative economic impacts have kept the idea from moving forward in the U.S.  Now, a group of leading Republican elders has a proposal that goes a step further.  They call it “Carbon Dividends,” because the taxes collected are returned to the public.  What is the local reaction?  In this installment of WEMU’s “Green Room” series, Barbara Lucas sets out to find out. Listen Listening... / 9:09 The Green Room: 03/31/2017 David Fair (DF): This is 89.1 WEMU and I’m David Fair. Welcome to “The Green Room.” The Trump administration is rolling back the Clean Power Plan. Those rules were enacted in the last administration in an effort to limit CO2 emissions from power plants.  Some say a rollback without replacement sounds a death knell for the Paris Agreement. That’s the multinational effort to avert climate disaster.  But, on February 8th, a surprising announcement was made by a group of Conservative elders that some consider a breakthrough.  It’s a climate change solution that just might have political legs.  The crucial question is:  will people lend their support? Barbara Lucas sets out to find out, in this month’s edition of the “Green Room.”  Group call:  All right, great job Grand Rapids! Detroit Michigan with eight people. Nice Detroit! Philadelphia, six people. Madison with forty today! Barbara Lucas (BL):  Those are some of the nearly 400 North American chapters of the Citizens’ Climate Lobby, checking in to their monthly group call. Group call:  The proposal is on an upstream fee on the carbon content of fossil fuels, starting at $40 per ton, increasing at 2% above inflation per year.  BL:  About 35 people in the Ann Arbor CCL chapter are gathered in a circle.  They’re listening intently to news of the climate solution announced February 8th by the newly formed Climate Leadership Council.  It’s a tax on carbon that’s collected at the source—the coal mine, the oil well, or the port of entry.  And the fee is distributed back to citizens in the form of a dividend, making it revenue neutral.  Group call:  The authors estimate emission reduction nearly two times what all Obama era regulations would achieve… BL:  Actually, this proposal is very similar to what the CCL’s 20,000 plus volunteers have already been lobbying for, for ten years now.  Group call:  …So this is not our policy, and we like our policy better, but it’s still something to be very excited about. BL:  The reception it’s received is impressive. Already over 26 major editorial endorsements:  The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Financial Times, The Nature Conservancy, National Audubon, the list goes on.  Why is the new proposal generating so much excitement? James Baker:  If we can get an insurance policy that is a conservative approach…. BL:  That’s no less than James Baker, former Secretary of State and Treasury Secretary under both Reagan and Bush. Baker:  …based on the free market, that limits government rather than expands it, and that is competitive internationally that's a win-win and we had to take a look at that. BL:  What?  A revered Republican, advocating a carbon tax?  Actually, he’s joined by a who’s who of conservatives:  George Schultz—another former Secretary of State and Treasury Secretary—under Nixon and Reagan.  Leading economists.  The CEO of Walmart. Baker:   I was and remain a skeptic about the extent to which man is responsible for climate change. BL:  But still, Baker says the risks are too great to ignore. He points out that President Reagan instituted a similar free market strategy to fight the looming threat of depletion of the ozone layer. Baker:  As it turned out the scientists who were worried at that time about that depletion, turned out to be right, and Reagan's Montreal Protocol came along just in time. So we argue that we should substitute a carbon tax for the raft of regulations and subsidies that now characterize this issue.  For the sake of our children and grandchildren… BL:  Here’s economist Marty Feldstein. Feldstein:  A carbon tax is just simply the simplest and most economically effective way to reduce the level of carbon emissions that contribute to global warming.  It’s better than the more cumbersome method of regulation that we now use.  It’s also simpler, and much more reliable, than the so-called cap and trade method. BL:  While the Citizens’ Climate Lobby strives to be nonpartisan, thus far it’s managed to attract mostly Progressives.  The Climate Leadership Council, in contrast, prominently bills itself as Conservative.   And considering current politics, that’s key.  But will that in itself be effective in enticing Republicans to embrace the plan?  BL:  Looking for folks who may be right of center, my first stop is the Dexter Forum.  The bimonthly discussion was founded and is co-led by a Democrat and a Republican.  BL:  Last week, I don’t know if anyone heard about it, there was a proposal to… BL:  No one here has heard of it yet, but initial reactions are skeptical. Forum Attendees:  I’m just sort of befuddled by it, that this is a conservative proposal, and the government collects money and distributes it to other people.  It’s not consistent with… and calls it market-based!  Sounds like a tax to me!  BL:  James Baker and his crew are well aware of this major challenge.  So they call it… Baker:  Carbon Dividends.  There’s a carbon tax buried in there somewhere, but this is a program for Carbon Dividends. Make sure you understand that. BL:  They estimate the dividend would start out at about $2,000 per household per year, and go up from there.  Baker:  This is not a tax in that sense. It does not grow government.  It is rebated dollar for dollar to the American people.  BL:  But still, Ed Francis, a left-leaning member of the Dexter Forum, is concerned about impacts to the poor.  He says some of them have far to travel, for work or groceries. Ed Francis: My concern is that, would that carbon tax somehow penalize those people?  It’s like, “Yeah, they get something back.”  But would it be enough to balance out their need?  BL:  Similar concerns were voiced by the left in the bitter battle over the carbon tax proposal which was defeated in Washington State, last November. But Climate Leadership Council founder Ted Halstead, says these fears are unfounded. Ted Halstead:  According to the Department of Treasury, 70% of Americans would come out ahead with this plan. In fact the bottom 70% of Americans would come out ahead under this plan. What that means it is 223 million Americans stand to benefit financially from solving climate change. BL:  But ultimately, will Progressives support a proposal offered by Conservatives? BL:  I’m in the “diag” at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor at a climate rally.  It’s February 18th and 66 degrees.  From the signs they’re carrying and their chants, I’m guessing this is a fairly left-of-center crowd. Rep. Debbie Dingell:  We can’t just gather in the diag. BL:  One of the six speakers is U.S. Congresswoman Debbie Dingell. Dingell:  We have to make sure that we have action plans, and that we are delivering on those action plans.  BL:  The Citizens’ Climate Lobby has co-sponsored the rally.  Here’s Ann Arbor CCL Chapter Chair Ginny Rogers, commenting on the news of the Conservatives’ action plan. Ginny Rogers:  Their plan is quite similar to ours. The differences in the Climate Leadership Council’s Carbon Dividends plan is that theirs also calls for eliminating some regulations, I think specifically the Clean Power Plan.  BL:  But any rollback of the Clean Power Plan makes it a non-starter with some groups, such as the Natural Resources Defense Council, which issued a statement in opposition.  Are there left-leaning leaders who will consider fewer regulations? Chip Smith, Ann Arbor City Council and Environmental Commission member, is a speaker at the rally.  Chip Smith:  But if it is, you know, “We think there’s a better way of accomplishing the same thing as the Clean Power Act,” well, then we would be doing a disservice to the country if we were to not have that discussion.  BL:  State Representative Yousef Rabhi is also a speaker at the rally. Rabhi:  No plan is perfect, of course, and something is better than nothing.  And if this plan has a chance of moving forward, then wonderful. BL:  Both seem willing to lend cautious support. Smith: Getting to the discussion of the national carbon tax is really, really important. And I think the only way we get there is if it comes from Republicans, quite frankly. BL:  While there’s opposition to this plan, there’s also support.  Those concerned about climate are relieved that a conversation, at least, may finally be starting that includes a broad spectrum of perspectives.  In the “Green Room,” I’m Barbara Lucas, WEMU News.

SHARE They’re still not listening By Greg Walcher Friday, March 31, 2017 An oft-quoted line in the Simon and Garfunkel classic “The Sound of Silence” laments “people hearing without listening.” It is an apt description of politicians, even famously successful ones, who still fail to grasp the lessons of the 2016 election. Several Republican “elder statesmen” recently published a new climate action plan, suggesting that the new Trump Administration adopt a gigantic carbon tax. It is eerily similar to the failed carbon tax proposed by the prior Administration, and still on the wish list of much of the global environmental industry. The new proposal would fulfill the dreams of environmental leaders from Barack Obama and Al Gore to Daryl Hannah and Lisa Jackson. But it didn’t come from any of them; it was written and published by a group of wealthy, elite former Republican officeholders. James Baker and George Schultz served as secretaries of State and Treasury under the last three Republican presidents; Baker also served as chief of staff to both Reagan and Bush. Martin Feldstein and Gregory Mankiw both chaired the President’s Council of Economic Advisors under George W. Bush. Henry Paulson was the Goldman-Sachs executive and the latter Bush’s Treasury secretary who helped bring about the 2008 economic collapse and binge of government bailouts. Together with Wal-Mart heir Rob Walton and a Silicon Valley venture capitalist who Bush appointed ambassador to Portugal, these business-political tycoons have proposed a climate approach that is all too familiar. Their plan begins with a tax of $40 a ton on carbon dioxide emissions, levied on oil, gas, and coal — and suggests that the tax increase in future years, ratcheting steadily upward until such fuels are no longer used. Nothing is new about that idea, a sure recipe for economic disaster. (Would these guys know a recession if they saw one?) However, they attempt to sweeten the deal with two “incentives” that would be new. First, they propose that the money collected would be given directly to taxpayers, like the oil dividends in Alaska. In fact, the proposal itself is cleverly titled “The Conservative Case for Carbon Dividends.” But they can’t pay a dividend without first collecting a tax (not a conservative idea). And if the carbon tax generates $200-300 billion annually in new revenue, as estimated, I am not convinced Congress can be trusted to continue simply giving it back to the people as proposed, especially in times of unsustainable budget deficits. Second, they propose to offset the impact on energy production by scaling back EPA regulations. They claim as carbon emissions decline, greenhouse regulations will simply become unnecessary. But unless they know a way to make China and India stop industrializing their economies, any carbon reductions in the U.S. alone would be almost unmeasurable — hardly an excuse for zealous federal regulators and their environmental allies to abandon the only system they understand. Anyway, such a cynical political deal is not necessary. This week, President Trump ordered an end to the coal-killing “Clean Power Plan” even without the ill-advised tradeoff of a new tax. Geophysicist Roger Andrews, who writes for Energy Matters, produced an excellent analysis of the economics of the proposed $40/ton carbon tax. Briefly, it would raise the price of oil about 25 percent, and the price of natural gas about double. But for coal, the price would triple in the Appalachians and increase six-fold or more in the Rockies. That would be a disaster in Colorado, where coal supplies over 60 percent of all electricity, and Wyoming where coal accounts for over 80 percent. Even the promised annual “dividend” of $2,000 (which would actually diminish as fossil fuels are phased out) would not offset the massive increase in gas prices, and especially electricity, paid by ordinary working people. The Baker-Schultz-Paulson report is almost comical in its spin. “President Donald Trump’s electoral victory stems in large part from his ability to speak to the increasing frustration and economic insecurity that many voters feel the political establishment has failed to address. This frustration has found expression in a growing populist sentiment and yearning for fundamental change. A carbon dividends plan responds to these powerful trends.” Apparently with a straight face, this comes from the very political establishment who failed so miserably to address that “frustration and economic insecurity.” And they now expect the public to be duped into supporting the very same government overreach. The only good news here is that their plan is dead on arrival in the new Administration, one whose election they can never understand as long as they continue “hearing without listening.” Greg Walcher is president of the Natural Resources Group and author of “Smoking Them Out: The Theft of the Environment and How to Take it Back.” He is a Western Slope native. COMMENTS Page 1 of 1 By ROBERT LAITRES - Friday, March 31, 2017 Mr. Walcher, listening only with one’s ears is not actually listening.  That failure to “listen” is not only a defect of those in political office, but much of the public and pundits such as yourself as well. There are also other ways that people cannot “hear” what others are saying.  Those are that they either don’t want to listen, or that some are shouting much too loud such that others cannot be heard over the din. When speaking of energy, as well as many other things, some of us make an attempt to see, not an industry, and not even those “people” (beings) in that industry do, but make an attempt to look at them as fellow human beings.  We also make a sincere attempt to look forward.  If we look at the past, we do so to learn from it and not, as far too many do, yearn for that past.  To do the latter can be compared to a driver moving forward, and keeping his eyes glued to the rear-view mirror. We are then with the classic “excuse” for inaction on our part with the following.  “But unless they know a way to make China and India stop industrializing their economies, any carbon reductions in the U.S. alone would be almost unmeasurable”, which amounts to little else that “They do it, so why can’t we..”, which amounts to little else than a child who tells his/her parent, “Well, Johnny did it so why shouldn’t I should be able to do it too”.  There is also the fact that when someone tells us that we are doing something wrong, doing the wrong thing, or point out to us that there is a better way of doing something, we have learned to listen instead of “doubling down” in whatever it is we are doing. There are economic considerations to almost everything but the objective and paramount concern should be about human beings and humanity, not about economics, which almost always boils down to nothing more than “What’s best for me, here and now?” or, nothing more than materialism or, pure selfishness and immediate self-gratification with no eye to the future.

Freestocks.org A time-traveler from the year 1984 would marvel at what the mall has become: a graveyard for brands like BCBG MaxAzria, PacSun, Aeropostale, Bebe and The Limited. All of these brands—which stood astride the mall landscape in the 1980s and 1990s—are either shuttering or planning on restructuring. What gives? Why are some mall retailers and malls suffering? Blame department stores for some of this: The business model of “we have a lot of mid-priced stuff in one place” doesn’t work in an age of big-box discounters like Wal-Mart and Target (which have a lot of lower-priced stuff in one place) and e-commerce. Department store foot traffic has declined, and the effect ripples out to the other mall retail outlets. Also, we’re just shopped out. Analysts have been talking about the oversaturation of the American retail landscape for some time. In 2013, the United States had 7.5 billion square feet of retail space, which works out to approximately 20 square feet per person. The U.K. has the second biggest concentration of retail space in a nation, with 3 square feet per person. In other words, the U.S. has nearly seven times the retail space as the number-two spot. A shakeout has been coming for a while—both among retail chains and malls in general. The International Council of Shopping Centers says there are 1,221 malls in the United States; Fung Global Retail and Technology Managing Director Deborah Weinswig wrote, “Given the current oversaturation of malls in the U.S., at least 30 percent of them need to be closed.” Don’t look to teenagers to keep mall sales afloat. Their status-seeking behavior is less about shopping and more about experience: according to analytics firm Retail Metrics’ President Ken Perkins, “Teens are more interested in dining out with friends, attending shows, concerts, sporting events that they can post to social media than they are about their wardrobes.” So what?  The death of individual mall brands suggests that American retail is undergoing a significant shift. Mainstream shoppers are now conditioned to expect fast fashion, with its high churn of inventory and frequent sales, and that’s not how a lot of mall-centric brands operate. Moreover, shoppers are moving online; e-commerce has clocked double-digit sales increases every year for the last few years. Brands and retailers would do well to look at Tibi, a contemporary casual brand that took a look at the sales declines bedeviling the department store sector and decided to build itself so that it isn’t dependent on department stores. The brand is still in some stores, but it also established a direct-to-consumer business. Thank e-commerce for that: it’s far cheaper now to showcase clothing when a generation of consumers knows, expects and likes the online experience. Malls as a business are undergoing a shift, too: high-end malls are booming. Also doing well are malls that have expanded beyond traditional retail to offer discounters like T.J. Maxx, grocery stores and other task-oriented outlets and that are stocking up on experience-oriented businesses like fitness centers, restaurants and theaters. Experience may well be what saves some department stores or big outlets: by providing customers with classes or opportunities to do something beyond spend money, they’ll be providing that experience-as-a-status kick people are looking for, something that simply can’t be purchased online. Who cares? Other than Robin Sparkles? City planners do. Malls and city governments are often at odds over whether or not a shopping mall actually brings any tax benefit to an area—the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn. has a 24-year history of having its business subsidized with city tax dollars. However, malls often pay seven figures in property taxes annually and the sales taxes charged by mall tenants can fund city government and its functions. When mall brands go under and shopping malls shut down, those taxes are lost. Amazon and Jet.com charge sales tax for residents of some states, so there’s some trickle back to the community level. But those commercial property taxes are gone—unless and until those malls get repurposed as hubs for other services, from community colleges to medical centers to apartments. And who knows? E-commerce might even be able to solve their last-mile distribution problems. Those moribund malls with their access to highways, truck delivery bays, and built-in parking infrastructure would make excellent hyperlocal warehouses or distribution centers. Want more?

Just a month ago, ads for Chase banking and other JPMorgan services could be found on over 400,000 sites, the company told Times reporter Sapna Meheshwari. But in the wake of a backlash against companies that advertise on fake news portals or sites such as Breitbart, the company slashed its online advertising down to approximately 5,000 pre-approved sites. Despite limiting the Internet properties on which it advertises, JPMorgan claims that it has seen almost no changes in the cost of impressions (the instances a banner ad appears on a webpage) or the visibility of the company in the online world. JPMorgan says it is being far more judicious about where its ads appear across the web, and that includes alongside online video content as well. Last week, the banking giant joined Johnson & Johnson and other widely-known brands in suspending their advertising spend on YouTube as some users had reportedly seen such ads alongside offensive videos. Additional companies, including Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Walmart and Dish Network, also announced that they would cease advertising on YouTube due to similar complaints. That news rocked Alphabet, the parent company of Google, as YouTube had emerged as one of the company’s more popular and profitable ventures. Shortly after those companies’ announcements, Alphabet’s stock price dropped 1.2 percent, though it has since then recovered. The sudden avoidance of YouTube and other internet sites is a blow to programmatic advertising, which had surged in popularity in recent years. Advertisers, especially those representing consumer brands, have eschewed ad buys on individual web sites as the technology that allows for targeting based on people’s web browsing habits became far more cost effective. As a result, someone browsing the web could see that smartphone ad on a popular web property or random individual technology blog. And if you were close to purchasing a product on a site such as Amazon, but either changed your mind or just forgot to follow through, programmatic advertising is why you might see that same gizmo appearing on various web sites week after week despite your loss of interest. This shift in advertising will hurt many third-party advertising companies, who are largely responsible for these large ad buys. And this trend could also hurt smaller web sites, as they reap some financial benefits from these massive ad purchases. The average internet user, however, may be relieved – as in the author of this article, who has often been rankled over the fact that every time he posts an article about Armenia or Armenians on his personal site, banners for the dating service “Armenian Friends” often appear. And this shift is hardly fool-proof, as the Times has also reported that some brands attempting to block their ads from appearing on Breitbart or similar sites could find their ads occasionally sneak through anyway. Nevertheless, JPMorgan’s change in tactics shows how the current political climate can prove toxic for brands and their advertising partners. Whether or not a company wants to appear aligned or distant from Donald Trump – or any controversial public figure or organization, for that matter – the sword cuts both ways. Depending on the product or service, half of a company’s customers will be jubilant, while the other half enraged. But as the growing outrage over fake news proliferates, paired with the growing evidence of Russia’s influence on the past election – and ensuing cover-up – the vast majority of marketing and brand managers will err on the side of caution.

In a news conference Tuesday morning to update their search for Elizabeth Thomas and her alleged kidnapper, 50-year-old Tad Cummins, authorities cautioned against the characterization that the two were involved romantically. "This is not a romance," TBI Director Mark Gwyn said. "This was a manipulation solely to benefit Tad Cummins. This is not a fairy tale. This is a kidnapping." Thomas and Cummins both went missing from Columbia, Tenn., March 13. Cummins had been suspended from his teaching job after a student reported seeing the two kiss in a classroom. Authorities have said they believe Cummins was grooming Thomas for possible sexual exploitation.

Thomas is 5 feet tall and about 120 pounds with blond hair and hazel eyes. Cummins is 6 feet tall and 200 pounds. The two may be in a silver Nissan Rogue with Tennessee plate number 976ZPT. "Two weeks into this, we would still urge the public if they have any information about the relationship between these two individuals, give us a call at 1-800-TBI-FIND," said TBI spokesman Josh Devine. "But we also want to be very clear with you. If you're driving down the road and find yourself behind that vehicle, try to do what you can to safely snap a picture and contact 911 immediately. In those types of instances, time is absolutely of the essence." × Post a comment as Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.

By Genevieve Nino | March 31, 2017 RyanJLane / Shutterstock.com When someone writes you a personal check, you can either cash it or deposit it into your bank account to get the money. Keep in mind that you might not be able to get cash immediately from a check if you deposit it into your account because the bank must ensure funds are available in the account from which it was written. Follow these steps on how to cash a personal check. As with any financial transaction, make sure you minimize your banking fees. How to Cash a Check at Your Bank It’s a straightforward process to get cash for a check at your own bank. There are a couple of steps to take at your bank: Endorse the back of the check by signing your name on the line at the top with the “x” to the left of it. Cash your check with a bank teller if you need the money immediately, or deposit it in your checking account via the ATM or mobile check deposit. See: 10 Best National Banks of 2017 How to Cash a Check Without a Bank Account You can still cash a check even if you don’t have a checking account. Here are four ways to cash a check without a bank account: Check-cashing stores are one way to cash your check without a bank account. You’ll likely pay a significant fee for this convenience, so make sure you shop around for the lowest price. Major retailers like supermarket chains, 7-11 and Walmart typically offer check-cashing services. Retailers also charge a processing fee, but it will likely be less than a check-cashing store fees. Go to the check-issuing bank to cash the check. You might have to pay a check-cashing fee, which varies from bank to bank, and you’ll need a photo ID. Use a prepaid account like NetSpend — you download the app, select “Mobile Check Load” from the “Move Money” menu and follow the instructions to take a picture of the check and deposit it. Once the card is funded, you can spend the money. Request the check issuer write the check to cash. If they write “cash” in the “Pay to the order of” line, you can then take it to any bank to cash the check. Learn: Cashier’s Check vs. Money Order — Here’s the Difference More Tips on How to Cash Checks You might still have some questions regarding cashing — or writing — a check. See if your answer is covered here. How Do You Write a Check? Put the name of the person you’re writing the check to on the first line, add the date at the top right-hand corner, then write the check’s numeral amount in the box next to the person’s name and spell out the check amount on the second line. Last, sign the check on the line located at the bottom right-hand corner. You can also include an optional memo noting the purpose of the check. See: How to Read and Write a Check Can You Cash a Check at Any Bank? If you don’t have an account at the bank where you are trying to cash the check, the bank is not obligated to cash it. Try calling ahead first. Can You Cash a Check at an ATM? You can deposit a check in your ATM, which is different from actually cashing it. Most banks need to ensure the check you deposit has the funds in that account to cover the amount of the check, so you likely won’t have access to the funds until at least one business day later. You’ll need a bank account to deposit a check. Up Next: Every Type of Check Fraud You Have to Worry About Share x Open a New Bank Account Check Out the Next Article Are Banks Open During Passover?

The new grocery pickup service is being tested by Amazon employees and will eventually expand to serve Amazon’s Prime members. It is part of a company initiative to expand business in the food and packaged goods market. Comments aAFont Size Amazon has invited some of the world's biggest brands to its Seattle headquarters in a bid to persuade them that it's time to start packaging their products to ease Amazon distribution. Executives from General Mills, Mondelez and other packaged-goods manufacturers will attend a three-day gathering in May, Bloomberg has learned. Attendees will tour an Amazon fulfillment center and hear a presentation from Worldwide Consumer Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Wilke, who reports directly to Jeff Bezos. Amazon is looking to upend relationships between brands and retail stores that for decades have determined how popular products are designed, packaged and shipped. If Amazon succeeds, big brands will think less about creating products that stand out in store aisles. Instead, they'll focus on designing products that can be shipped quickly to customers' doorsteps. "Times are changing," Amazon said in an invitation obtained by Bloomberg. "Amazon strongly believes that supply chains designed to serve the direct-to-consumer business have the power to bring improved customer experiences and global efficiency. To achieve this requires a major shift in thinking." Manufacturers would have to reimagine everything from the way products are made to how they're packaged. Laundry detergent could come in sturdier, leak-proof containers. Instead of packages designed to stack on store shelves, cookies, crackers and cereal could be packed in durable, unadorned boxes. Factories could make products for individuals rather than trucks-full of inventory. It's unclear who would handle the shipping, though Amazon offers a range of services. The company declined to comment. Amazon has been struggling to crack the food and packaged-goods market -- an $800 billion category still dominated by Wal-Mart and other chains. Persuading brands to design their packaging and operations for the online world would make it easier for Amazon to ship household goods in less than an hour, potentially making trips to the store unnecessary. Amazon must convince brands that even though online purchases represent a small part of their sales, e-commerce is the future. "Most of these people haven't been interested in e-commerce because e-commerce has been such a small piece of their overall sales," said Melissa Burdick, vice president of e-commerce at The Mars Agency marketing firm. "But we've reached a tipping point. We're at a time when companies are ready to start figuring this stuff out." Amazon is looking to influence product-makers the same way Costco and other club stores persuaded brands more than 20 years ago to create bulk sizes sold at a discount. "There was a big perceived penalty for missing the boat, fear of missing out on growth," said Jim Hertel, senior vice president at the marketing firm Inmar. Just like Costco, he said, Amazon will encourage the changes by promising increased sales. Amazon has already forced some manufacturers to revolutionize their packaging. For years toy- and electronics-makers have packaged their wares to help prevent theft and to maximize store display. But the packages' tough plastic was hard to open, turning off millions of consumers. Amazon pushed manufacturers to develop packages that pop open more easily. Today thousands of "frustration-free" products are sold on its site. Some brands will be easier to persuade than others. One could be Nike, which has an Amazon store and has been experimenting with selling directly to consumers. Nike Chief Operating Officer Eric Sprunk is scheduled to speak at Amazon's Seattle gathering. The event's co-host is SCM World, a research and conference group that serves the supply-chain industry. SCM's advisory board includes executives from Unilever, Kimberly-Clark and Land O'Lakes butter. Amazon's pitch comes as retail store competitors try to blunt its momentum by enhancing their own online shopping options. Wal-Mart and other retailers are experimenting with services such as online purchases that can be picked up in store. Startups such as Instacart and Deliv make deliveries from stores to homes, helping retailers keep up with Amazon. Looking to match the quick delivery benefits of Amazon Prime membership, Wal-Mart offers a free two-day delivery on orders of $35 or more. Wal-Mart and Amazon squared off last week in Las Vegas with keynote speeches at the ShopTalk conference that drew more than 5,000 attendees, including executives with major brands. Marc Lore, who heads Wal-Mart's e-commerce initiatives, touted the price leverage of the world's biggest retailer that buys products by the truckload. Peter Faricy, who runs Amazon's marketplace, said the online retailer would continue to narrow shipping times and talked up a future when one-hour delivery is the standard. Despite the long relationships between brands and traditional stores, Amazon has leverage to convince manufacturers to rethink their operations, said Ken Cassar, an analyst at Slice Intelligence. He notes that Amazon has 300 million shoppers and can make its own products if brands aren't willing to sell on its marketplace. "Fear, more than anything else," Cassar said, "may compel these companies to pay attention." Information for this article was contributed by Matthew Boyle of Bloomberg News.

Home Tools Solano News US / World Opinion Features Entertainment Sports Business Real Estate Obituaries Gallery Classifieds Community News & Views 7,878 123 FAIRFIELD-SUISUN, CALIFORNIA Suisun City's Measure S sales tax will take effect on Saturday. (Robinson Kuntz/Daily Republic) Suisun City Suisun sales tax kicks in Saturday By Ian Thompson From page A3 | March 31, 2017 SUISUN CITY — Starting Saturday, shoppers in Suisun City will be paying 1 cent more per every dollar spent as the recently approved Measure S sales tax takes effect. Suisun City residents and business owners have largely been ambivalent about that fact, saying that the voters have spoken and it’s now up to the city to spend that money where they promised. “Do I like being taxed more? No,” said resident Jose Sanchez. “But I do like streets that are fixed and less crime, which is (what) people have been saying most of the money should be spent on. So I voted yes. If the city keeps its word, I am good with it (the tax); if not, you are going to have a lot of angry people at election time.” Brenda Kramer stated, with the exception of Walmart, she shops in Fairfield, but said the money is needed to fix the roads. “I can think of more than a few streets in my neighborhood that need work. If the tax fixes those, I don’t mind paying a little extra.” Those residents who showed up at a Wednesday community meeting on where to spend the money apparently support spending a good portion of the expected $1.8 million a year that the tax is expected to generate on police and code enforcement, followed by street repair and fire protection in the form of getting a new fire engine. Downtown businessman John Harter will be one of those charging the extra 1-cent-on-the-dollar starting Saturday. “The voters have spoken and it will be interesting to see what new services will come from the revenues for residents and business owners,” Harter said. Suisun City Hall is expected to get the first of the quarterly payments from the tax some time in July. A City Council study session to examine the results of last Wednesday’s community meeting will be held next month and the council is also expected to approve which residents will be sitting on the Measure S oversight committee at the council’s second meeting in April, according to City Manager Suzanne Bragdon. Suisun City was one of 41 towns and seven counties, from Yreka in Siskiyou County to El Centro in Imperial County, whose sales taxes will go up on Saturday. Measure S was also not the only local tax on the ballot last fall. Vacaville residents voted to not only renew a 10-year-old quarter-cent sales tax, but also to add an additional half-cent sales tax the increased funds from which are expected to start arriving next year. Fairfield’s Measure P allowed the city to continue its 1-cent sales tax that voters initially approved in 2012. It brings the city about $16 million yearly. Measure P expires in March 2018.

What are you, a chump?Reply Report abusive comment Mr. PracticalMarch 31, 2017 - 7:41 am When was the last time Suisun raised taxes?Reply Report abusive comment Matter of FactMarch 31, 2017 - 8:27 am Suisun hasn't had a sales tax that I can remember. I think TfT is just blowing smoke and hoping to start a fire.Reply Report abusive comment Mr. PracticalMarch 31, 2017 - 8:40 am MoF, correct. Even with this increase, we're still in the bottom third of sales tax rates in the state.Reply Report abusive comment Time for TruthMarch 31, 2017 - 9:20 am So it's only local sales tax that pays for fixing roads in California? News to me. (Fake news?)Reply Report abusive comment Mr. PracticalMarch 31, 2017 - 9:24 am You said, "the last time they raised taxes." "They" implies you meant the subject of the article, which is Suisun. Suisun, hasn't raised taxes in the past. Unless you wan't to count the library tax. I don't.Reply Report abusive comment Time for TruthMarch 31, 2017 - 9:46 am Mr P, the implication is taxing authorities that raise taxes. "They" always throw out such things as "for the children" and to "fix the roads" and similar emotive pleas to get support. If all those promises had been kept, "they" would have delivered utopia by now.Reply Report abusive comment Mr. PracticalMarch 31, 2017 - 12:49 pm I get it now. You just didn't state your case clearly. No worries. All taxes aren't bad. All taxes aren't good.

The changes in question would allow global retailers to sell a percentage of non-food items, said Union food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal. "It would be at least $10 bn initial investment if 'food plus' gets the final nod. Not just for India; we have the UAE and Japan planning on making in India and taking it to their country. Before (the) 'World Food India' (event, scheduled for September), a lot of things might just get tied up," she hopes. The ministry of food processing industries (MoFPI) hopes some of these decisions would be taken by the year-end. Badal stresses the 'food plus' component in the policy on FDI in retailing suggested by her ministry would not be a backdoor entry for multinational entities such as Walmart, Tesco or Auchan. She said global retailers would only be allowed to set up shop if they put investment in the back-end, at the 'farm gate' level which would directly benefit cultivators. "I put in a request that if besides their investment in retail, if they put some extra investment at the farmgate level, then the government might think of allowing them some small percentage of other home care products. I have made it clear that whatever investment they do at the farmgate level, some percentage of that they may be allowed to keep on other things, which also must be manufactured in India," she said. Food accounts for about 70 per cent of India's $600-bn retail market. The government is looking at tripling this over the next five years, Badal said. Major retailers had said they have an existing model which would cover items beside food, the minister explained. Only food does not manage to meet their costs. While the definition of 'food plus or non-food' and what all would be allowed in food plus has not been decided, Badal said it would mainly have home care and fast moving consumer goods, fully made in India. "First of all, we have to see whether we allow it or not. I have sent suggestions and a note to the prime minister's office. Once the PM says yes to the suggestions, further details of the plan would be charged," she said. On the percentage of non-food items to be allowed, MoFPI is playing it safe. "I have suggested that whatever investments they make in the back-end infrastructure, it should be around 20 per cent of that," added Badal. According to the ministry, not only Walmart but other global entities such as Tesco, Auchan, Harrods, Partridges and Marks & Spencer had all shown interest in setting up shop in India if 'food plus' was allowed. "I am pushing the policy (change). We have got a company like Auchan which has said that they would like to work with farmers. Our aim is that major companies tie-up with farmers," she said.   Govt plans Model Food Policy The Ministry of Food Processing Industries has come out with a Model Food Policy which it has uploaded on its website for comments. It hopes that states will adopt a final policy before the World Food Fair. For the next round of 50-odd cold storages, approval for which has been sought by various companies, Harsimrat Kaur Badal said that she would do a proper satellite mapping of food and vegetable clusters before inviting expression of interests.

Just the other day a 17-year-old girl overdosed in the parking lot of a shopping store in Bartholomew County. The Bartholomew County Sheriff’s Office is working with other agencies to do whatever they can to stop the drugs from making its way to Bartholomew County. So far this year they have seen an increase in the number of overdose calls in the county and city of Columbus. The latest overdose call for Bartholomew County happened Tuesday night in the parking lot of the Wal-Mart on State Road 46. “The actual call came in as just a 911 call and they responded to the reported 911 and when they arrived they ended up finding a young person in an OD state,” said Major Chris Lane, Bartholomew County Sheriff’s Office. The sheriff’s office said a deputy was in the area and responded to the call. He found a car running with lights on and inside a 17-year-old girl in the front seat. The sheriff’s office said the deputy used two doses of Narcan to bring the girl back. “It’s unfortunate in that it’s almost becoming routine that between, not only my agency or the sheriff’s office or the city police or the state police, we routinely are running on overdose calls,” he said. Lane is the Chief Deputy for the sheriff’s office. He said so far this year the city and county responded to 72 overdose calls and that number was 35 last year. “I’ve never seen anything like the opioid issue that we’re struggling with and again it’s not just here it’s a national problem,” he said. Lane said this problem affects everyone in the community from parents to kids. “Obviously, parents that are struggling with when they got kids that are struggling with addiction or kids that have parents that struggle with addiction,” he said. He believes there’s also a desperate need for more treatment facilities in the area. “Our community is no different than any other community. Everybody is struggling with this and everybody is struggling with a place for these folks to go,” he said. “They show up at hospitals, a lot of time hospitals have limited resources on what they could do for long-term treatment.” Lane knows change won’t happen overnight. He said building awareness is important and stopping people from moving the drugs into the community. “If somebody got an addiction they need the help but if somebody is pushing this poison I got a place for them and it’s in the jail,” he said. As for the 17-year-old girl, the sheriff’s office said she was taken to Columbus Regional Hospital. At this time, her condition is still unknown. A community forum to talk about the heroin epidemic in Columbus is happening on April 19 from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. It will be held at The Commons located at 300 Washington Street in Columbus.

Billion-dollar deals, millions in tournament prizes, and a massive, enthusiastic audience explain the attention eSports has been getting from major gaming companies. Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Mar 30, 2017 at 5:15PM In this segment from Industry Focus: Consumer Goods, Vincent Shen recruits Fool.com contributor Seth McNew to share the latest news from the world of eSports. Competitive gaming events are selling out arenas and awarding millions of dollars to tournament champions. Though revenue opportunities for the growing industry have yet to reach traditional sport levels, analysts estimate eSports will top $1 billion in the next year with more growth on the way. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on March 23, 2017. Vincent Shen: You mentioned Oculus. I want to get to virtual reality, we'll save some time for that. But eSports is what really blew me away. It's March, we're in the thick of March Madness. My team might be out as a UVA alum. But, while watching that game, I could not believe it, I saw commercials for a Street Fighter 5 championship eSport event being aired on ESPN. The first time I've seen -- maybe I don't watch enough network cable television with commercials, because I'm usually on Netflix. But I was blown away by this. It made me realize that a lot of companies point to eSports as a big opportunity, but the legitimacy there, I feel like anybody that's watching these games and sees that is like, "What is this doing on ESPN?" And now, you get an idea of how big this opportunity is. What do you think about this? Seth McNew: Yeah, certainly, seeing it on TV, there's a lot of companies that are trying to play in the space right now, not just the players we've mentioned so far, but ESPN, YouTube, recently Amazon bought Twitch, which is known for its eSports. But, what I think is interesting here is, first of all, we should just talk about what eSports is. It's electronic sports. Essentially, there's pro gamers playing against each other, usually for a cash prize. As you would imagine, there are people watching this. There is a fan base which leaves open the door for advertisements and other revenue. Shen: You brought this to me, and I think I've touched on this in a previous episode before, but some of these tournaments, the prize pools are not trivial at all. McNew: Yeah, you're talking about prize pools of tens of millions of dollars. The most recent one was over $20 million. That's incredible.  Shen: Yes. So, as you can imagine, with that kind of money on the line, you're going to start really attracting a bigger and bigger pool of people wanting to get into this in a professional manner. But the thing is, I was trying to get a sense of the scale for this, 385 million people globally in terms of audience size for eSports. Huge, right? McNew: Have you ever watch eSports, or any gaming? Shen: I have, through YouTube. I haven't seen it on television, I haven't taken that step yet. Funny enough, I have been to a live event before at the conference center here in D.C., just out of curiosity, to get a lay of the land. And it was for Pokemon. McNew: Does it feel like a sporting event, with all the fanfare? Shen: You have everybody seated. There wasn't tens of thousands of people, of course. But seeing people playing with the big screens, I saw a lot of potential. And I can imagine that going to a full event with tons of fans in an arena -- because this was more of just a conference for Pokemon -- I could see that having an energy level that people might typically associated with professional sports. 385 million globally in terms of audiences for eSports. And the thing is, this is really in its infancy, really early stages. I found an analysis that said the revenue for this market is not expected to break $1 billion until next year. So, the companies that are investing heavily in this, including Electronic Arts and Activision, they're really not making that much money on this, if any at all. But the idea is, you could attract more gamers, you could build more buzz and publicity for various titles, and ultimately, people are starting to say, 385 million viewers, some of these audiences are bigger than major professional sports leagues like the NBA, does that mean they can make more money? The issue right now is, by comparison, the NFL generated $11 billion in 2015 from ticket sales, TV rights, and sponsorships. eSports hasn't even broken that $1 billion marker. The problem is, I think, ultimately, the number of events you can have between NFL games and different franchises, the number of games played in the season, you have a lot of events generating those ticket sales, and a lot of money from those TV deals. You've heard about these billion-dollar deals signed to air football games, for example. Whether we reach that threshold, that point for eSports remains to be seen. But ultimately, it's definitely an exciting avenue. Anything else you've seen with eSports that you want to leave listeners with? McNew: That's a good point, how small it is right now comparative. But I think it's interesting that there can be new content that drives its own leagues. It might be a place where there's just as many opportunities to have these kinds of competitions, as you have different leagues that are devoted to a specific game, more games have more leagues, and also the ability to have these in house ones in any arena, you don't have to have them in an arena that's specific for gaming, you just need to have a TV there. So I think it's possible that this could grow much more regionally. Shen: OK. Something else I've also kept in mind, and people stress with eSports, is that it can change as the technology we have available to us, in terms of how we consume our media, it changes. Virtual reality, some of the first major headsets or devices for that, the hardware for that, went on sale last year. That could potentially change how we view an eSports tournament.

Scott Harper Jr., 26, was charged Thursday with theft with a prior retail theft conviction following his arrest Wednesday evening by Urbana police in the parking lot of the Wal-Mart store at 100 High Cross Road. Sgt. Harley Rutledge said store employees summoned police to look for a man who had allegedly shoplifted a four-pack of "Ultra Duster" canned air, commonly used to clean computer keyboards. Officers were given a description of the man and the car he got in. Patrol officers found Harper in his car in the parking lot just before 6 p.m. He appeared to be intoxicated, had difficulty standing, had slurred speech and was wearing pajama pants, Rutledge said. In the car, officers could see about 30 cans of compressed air in the front and back seats. After initially denying having taken the canned air, Harper told the officers he stole it to "huff" it and that he was struggling with an addiction to that practice. Champaign police also found Harper on Sunday in the parking lot of the Meijer store, 2401 N. Prospect Ave. He was found "huffing" that day and police found at least six cans of Ultra Duster in his car. He admitted he had been inhaling enough to pass out. Inhaling vapors from pressurized containers can produce a brief intense intoxicating effect. Long-term, the practice can cause brain damage. On Sunday, police gave him a notice to appear in court next month; but in the wake of his arrest Wednesday by Urbana police, the state's attorney's office filed the single felony count against Harper. Use of intoxicating compounds is a less serious misdemeanor offense. If convicted, he faces penalties ranging from probation to one to three years in prison. Court records show he has prior convictions for domestic battery, retail theft, violation of bail bond and traffic convictions.

Sundeep Khanna India’s floundering e-commerce start-ups such as Snapdeal need new and innovative ideas to enhance the shopping experience. Photo: Aniruddha Chowdhury/Mint Every week now, there’s news of one more e-commerce start-up finally accepting it has no future. As the irrational cost structure overlaid with a business model solely driven by deep discounts, catches up, the limitations of online shopping are being laid bare. Last week Mint reported that facing an asphyxiating funds crunch, Snapdeal, owned by Jasper Infotech Pvt. Ltd, was in talks with its two larger rivals Paytm E-Commerce Pvt. Ltd and Flipkart India for what would amount to a fire sale. Snapdeal’s woes are neither new nor unique. Increasingly, e-commerce’s lead companies are finding that the number of transactions and the value thereof, isn’t a good enough indicator of their own health or that of the sector.  Consequently, valuations have slumped, in some cases to a third of what they were even a year ago, indicating how much funders have lost faith in their investees as well as how the outlook on the sector has dimmed dramatically. Contrast this with the striking success of supermarket chain, Avenue Supermarts Ltd, the parent of D-Mart, which is both profitable and growing, entirely in the physical retail space. It isn’t a coincidence that at the same time as pure play e-commerce start-ups are cutting back on costs, laying off people and pulling out of Tier-II and Tier-III cities, the big daddies of brick-and-mortar retail, companies like Reliance Retail and even Walmart India, are now stepping up their investments in stores and what is called in-store experiences after a period of strategic consolidation. There’s a pattern to why start-ups like Snapdeal and ShopClues and even Flipkart are suffering. All of them set themselves up as pure online plays and nothing more. Today, without their deep discounts, they offer a customer virtually nothing else. The centuries-old offline retail system has quickly adjusted to anything else the newbies brought in. Home delivery, orders on phone, vast menu options, procuring off-the-menu items, loyalty points, various payment methods, anything the newcomers can do, they can do. In most cases now, offline retailers have a strong online presence as well and thereby allow customers the option of checking out products in the physical space while allowing them to order online.  Instead of trying to complement a well-established if unorganized retail system, the e-commerce companies focused purely on replacing it with something of their own. If they had concentrated instead on removing the hurdles for shoppers, in much the way the first malls did on their appearance (basement parking, clean washrooms, children’s play areas, places to eat, ATMs), they might have found themselves fitting better into the overall ecosystem of shopping. Most Indian online retailers are clones of their counterparts in the US and would do well to take a cue from what’s happening in the world’s most complex retail market. Data from US Census Bureau shows that in the US, Amazon-dominated non-store retailer’s category posted the fastest pace of growth in sales in February (up 13% year-on-year) even as department store sales reported continuing weakness in their results (down 5.6% year-on-year). While that’s encouraging, the fact is, two decades after Amazon kicked off online shopping, the category still accounts for less than 10% of global retail sales. While growth will continue to be robust, they will not match offline retail any time soon. According to projections by eMarketer, retail e-commerce sales will increase to $4.058 trillion in 2020, still accounting for just 14.6% of total retail spending. That shows the way forward for India’s stricken online retail start-ups. There is clear evidence based on tracking of shoppers’ navigation to show that a bulk of those who search and evaluate products and services on the web, eventually end up buying offline. Indeed, the future of retail lies in optimum combination of various channels, both offline and online, what is now called cross-channel retail.  According to Forrester Research, cross-channel retail sales will reach $1.8 trillion in the US by 2017. A 2015 Mastercard report, The Omnishopper Project, identified the physical store as the Centerpiece of the Omnishopper’s Universe. As the report said, “The omnishopper goes to physical locations for the entertainment value of shopping, superior inventory levels and social interaction.” The high street isn’t disappearing, not now, not perhaps ever. India’s floundering e-commerce start-ups need new and innovative ideas to enhance the shopping experience. But vitally they also need to ensure they are in a place where shoppers look for them, online as well as offline.  Sundeep Khanna is a consulting editor at Mint and oversees the newsroom’s corporate coverage.

After a brief struggle, the female got back into the Nissan.  A white male with dark hair was in the Nissan at the time but never exited the vehicle. The vehicle possibly had Kansas tags with the numbers 959. This case currently under investigation. There is no indication at this time that this incident has anything to do with Human Trafficking or that the public is in any immediate danger. We do ask that as always, be vigilant in parking lots and if something does not feel or look right, walk away and call the police. If anyone has any information on this case or can identify the vehicle attached to call the police department at 762-5912, Crimestoppers at 762-8477 or leave a web tip at https://www.tipsubmit.com/webtips.aspx?AgencyID=1216.

David Eulitt deulitt@kcstar.com i By Jesse Newell jnewell@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story MARYVILLE, Mo. Ben McCollum isn’t finished with his Blitz burger yet — or his cheddar chips, a specialty at Carson’s Sports Grille downtown — when an old friend makes the way to his booth. It’s the third time Northwest Missouri State’s men’s basketball coach has been greeted in the last 20 minutes, and this conversation ends with the man telling McCollum he’s already paid for his lunch. McCollum admits he’s not yet accustomed to all this yet — the life of a national championship coach and changes that have taken place since Northwest Missouri’s 71-61 victory over Fairmont State (W. Va.) last week in Sioux Falls, S.D. A trip to Wal-Mart took twice as long because of the well-wishers. McCollum had 289 text messages after the game and has gotten double that in the days since … and that’s even without him checking his inboxes on Twitter and Facebook. “It’s nice,” McCollum said, “but I’m more of a low-key guy.” That hasn’t changed in the past few days. The 35-year-old McCollum pokes his head up over the booth a few times to chat with Northwest fans at the table next to him. He tells the owner of the bar, Carson, that he’s working too hard, and an hour later near his office, he greets the janitor Mark on his way down the stairs with the national championship trophy. “Do you carry that all the time?” Mark says. “I don’t want anyone to touch it,” McCollum answers with a laugh. Perhaps these moments help explain how the Bearcats were able to win their first men’s basketball championship at a school known more for its football dominance. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 33:44 Breaking down the end of KU basketball season and looking ahead to 2017-18 Pause 2:21 Lyric Washington-Gaw stared death in the face 'and gave it a raspberry' 1:40 Red Bridge YMCA and Initiative PB&J will attempt world record 3:48 Danny Duffy's childhood home in Lompoc, California filled with memorabilia, memories 3:54 'The Gorsuch situation is really hard,' says McCaskill in leaked audio 1:49 Pelicans in Missouri?

Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email Ben McCollum and Northwest Missouri State brings championship trophy to Maryville Northwest Missouri State University men's basketball coach Ben McCollum spoke about his Bearcats team winning the NCAA Division II championship Saturday in South Dakota. David Eulitt The Kansas City Star   McCollum, from all appearances, appears to embody the culture he wanted to build long ago. “There’s natural rules that are set up that aren’t ever written or spoken,” he said. “It’s just, ‘This is how you act.’ “I don’t have to tell you to say thank you to a waitress. I don’t have to tell you if you see somebody cleaning something up to help them clean it up. I don’t have to tell you to open doors for people. That’s what you do.” McCollum admits this success wouldn’t have come if not for some helpful words from his mother. He didn’t start out as a winner. McCollum, who was hired as his alma mater’s coach when he was 27, went 12-15 in 2009-10, his first season, and 10-16 in his second. He was so dejected after one loss his second year he remembers telling his mom he didn’t think he could do this anymore; he simply wasn’t a good enough coach. Mary Timko was the voice of reason. She spoke to him about his tone, telling her son he couldn’t expect his players to not get frustrated on the court if he was angry himself. “After that, I was just positive and understood my impact on their emotion and the next-play mentality,” McCollum said. “It seemed to help quite a bit.” The birth of Northwest’s two mantras came shortly after that. One was “Impose your will.” McCollum stole inspiration from the fifth century B.C. book “Art of War,” wanting his players to be proactive in all aspects of life, whether that was attacking a workout or sprint drill or responding to an official’s call. “If you don’t respond to it and move onto the next play, you’ve imposed your will on it,” McCollum said. “You’re going to act how you act regardless of what’s going on.” That served Northwest well in its final game. Because Fairmont State played a West Virginia-like havoc style — coach Jerrod Calhoun was a former assistant coach for Bob Huggins — McCollum’s main message to his team was to be the aggressor and play its tempo with physicality. The Bearcats did that, handling Fairmont State’s press while holding a double-digit lead through the majority of the game. McCollum also believes in the words “Culture wins.” He’s learned there’s one type of player he doesn’t mesh with it, and that’s someone he describes as “moody.” The coach works hard to make sure those guys don’t end up on his team. He does extra research on personalities, and it’s probably not a coincidence that 13 of the 14 players on this year’s roster came from places that are within two hours of Maryville — a town of about 12,000 tucked in the northwest corner of Missouri. McCollum also has created his own rule with recruits: He wants them to pick up his phone call, but he promises that the conversation won’t last more than four minutes. That way he can develop a relationship while also catering to the faster-paced lifestyle of millennials. The methods appear to have worked. It helped bring McCollum point guard Justin Pitts, the consensus NCAA Division II player of the year from Blue Springs South whose original offers included MidAmerica Nazarene, Graceland and a partial-scholarship tender from Northwest. Zach Schneider shot fewer than 100 three-pointers in his career at Shawnee Mission East, but made 111 of them this season alone after pledging to become the best stretch-4 he could be. Through it all, the culture began to take shape. McCollum not only had four- and five-year guys — and the hard workers he desired — but he also saw the older players setting the guidelines for the program. “You don’t really have to set rules,” McCollum said. “The culture sets the rules.” McCollum also focused on getting players to recognize how they can help the team. “Be who you are” he tells them often, which encourages both shooters and screen-setters to embrace their strengths. “It just works out,” Schneider said, “and it results in that special season that we had.” When former Northwest coach Steve Tappmeyer made the 10-hour drive to Sioux Falls to watch the Bearcats, he wasn’t surprised to see so many Northwest players taking to their roles. McCollum had done the same thing some 15 years earlier. When Tappmeyer coached McCollum at Northwest Missouri from 2001-03, he could tell the guard was destined for big things. In finance, that is. “I thought he was going to go and make money, and he came walking in said, ‘I think I want to coach,’” Tappmeyer said with a laugh. “I was kind of like, ‘Why?’” Best known for his intangibles when he was a reserve for the Beatcats, McCollum showed early coaching potential, even if the decision meant a potential hit to his future earnings. He became a graduate assistant at Northwest, where his high energy commanded respect from both players and coaches. When Tappmeyer retired in 2009, he suggested that McCollum — who had moved on to become an assistant at Emporia State — was the ideal replacement even as a 27-year-old. “I thought he had everything it took except experience,” Tappmeyer said. McCollum has gained that over the last eight seasons. Though he admits that he didn’t have enough of a coaching emphasis in his first two seasons, McCollum remedied that while winning conference titles in five of the last six seasons. A key moment came that second year after a loss against Nebraska-Omaha. When McCollum rewatched film, he became frustrated when his team allowed layups simply because it wasn’t getting back defensively. McCollum decided a personal philosophy was going to be an emphasis on areas not determined by luck. Transition defense and rebounding drills would take up a majority of the team’s practice time. Taking care of the basketball and putting up good shots on offense became main points offensively. “The only thing you really can’t control is officiating and shot-making,” McCollum said, “but we control everything else.” It all came together in the postseason this year. Northwest previously had three Sweet 16 losses, the first of which starting an unexpected chain reaction. Three years ago, Northwest Missouri faced Central Missouri in the regional championship when the Bearcats’ all-league post player Dillon Starzl went down with a torn Achilles injury four minutes in. Central Missouri won 60-59 in overtime — and followed that with three more victories to take the national championship. Shortly after that, Central Missouri coach Kim Anderson became the successor to Frank Haith at Missouri, with McCollum joking with him over the phone this week that it all wouldn’t have happened if not for a freak injury. In many ways, McCollum’s life hasn’t changed, even after a national championship. While some of the texts he receives are about recruiting, others are about his 10-year-old son Peyton’s baseball team; McCollum is one of the team’s coaches during the summer. The coach isn’t oblivious to how this past week could change things. Anderson parlayed his success into another gig, and just earlier this week, Calhoun — the coach McCollum defeated in the title game — left Fairmont State for Division I Youngstown State. “I’m not in a rush,” McCollum said of taking another position, “because I’ve got a good job.” Someday, a mid-major Division I program could be a fit. He’s still only 35, and that type of job would allow him to keep his focus on the kinds of kids he likes to coach. McCollum, who was planning to attend the Final Four in Glendale, Ariz., has always been someone driven by specific goals. When he was a graduate assistant at Northwest, he wrote down that he wanted to become a head coach or Division I assistant by the age of 27. He was hired as full-time coach at Northwest on April 11, 2009 — the day before his 28th birthday. For now, McCollum says he and his staff are trying to enjoy as much as they can. And while the goals will remain the same — establishing a culture, imposing their will — this nonetheless will be new. Maryville is just starting to celebrate its newest national champion, which means free meals and longer trips to Wal-Mart might be part of the deal for the foreseeable future. And while McCollum appreciates those who stood by the team before this season, he admits the recent response has been gratifying as well. “We’ll still welcome anybody,” he said with a smile, “who wants to jump on the bandwagon.” Jesse Newell: 816-234-4759, @jessenewell Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story College Sports Suggested for you Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 2:21 Lyric Washington-Gaw stared death in the face 'and gave it a raspberry' Pause 1:40 Red Bridge YMCA and Initiative PB&J will attempt world record 3:48 Danny Duffy's childhood home in Lompoc, California filled with memorabilia, memories 3:54 'The Gorsuch situation is really hard,' says McCaskill in leaked audio 1:49 Pelicans in Missouri?

 5 browser extensions that could save you money while you shop Ramit Sethi, I Will Teach You To Be Rich Mar. 31, 2017, 2:12 PM 1,323 facebook linkedin twitter email print Try Amazon's official browser extension to get price and product comparisons. Flickr / Kārlis Dambrāns I love automation. I love it so much, I try to automate whenever I can — even when it comes to shopping. From the comfort of my browser and favorite pair of sweatpants, I can: Get my grocery shopping done Buy some new books Order a vase of flowers for my mom because I’m an AWESOME son . . . all while saving time to focus on my business. Though the convenience is great, I’ve also been able to incorporate savings into my automation process. Before everyone accuses me of being a frugalista who clips out stacks of coupons to save a few cents on toilet paper, know that I do actually think it’s a good idea to save on your purchases — but only if you automate the savings so you’re not wasting time. Here are 5½ extensions (you read that right) I use to find the best deals without wasting a bunch of time. 1. Honey — Finds coupon codes everywhere The Honey handy plug-in aggregates every discount/coupon code available on an online store, helping you save money INSTANTLY. That’s right, no more relistening to old podcast episode ads so you can write down that coupon code. Say I head over to J.Crew’s website to buy a new sweater. As soon as I open up the site, the extension automatically tells me how many coupon codes are available for the store. At checkout, I simply go to the Honey extension, click the code I want to use, and paste it into the promo box. Once you’ve bought enough items using the extension, you have the opportunity to get cash back through the app. Instant savings and cash-back. It’s a smart way to save money and time. 2. Amazon Assistant — Save time and money on Amazon Amazon Assistant, which is Amazon’s official browser extension, gives you handy product and price comparisons so you don’t have to spend hours looking for a cheaper option online. It also automatically allows you to check out their Deal of the Day, their markdown of some great products that only last for one day. My favorite thing about the plug-in has to be the feature that takes you straight to AmazonSmile — a program that automatically donates a portion of your purchase to various charities at no cost to you. (I like Pencils of Promise.) Let’s recap the benefits: Savings on products you want An easy way to browse daily deals on Amazon The warm feeling you get from donating to a good cause (you’re saving money AND lives) 3. Price Alarm — Find the best prices on eBay and Amazon Price Alarm tracks prices on both Amazon and eBay so you can STOP constantly checking that listing like it’s an ex’s Instagram. Just find a product you want on Price Alarm’s website, click on the price alarm button, and set the price you want to pay for the product. Once the item reaches the price you set, you’ll receive an email or tweet notifying you. Plus, you’ll get some of the best deals on stuff. Check out how much cheaper this TV is on eBay compared to Amazon. 4. Swagbucks — Get cash back constantly This plugin earns you Swagbucks by doing things online you would have already been doing anyway like: Shopping Watching videos Using a search engine to find information You can eventually trade in the Swagbucks for gift cards to stores like Amazon or Wal-Mart, or for cash back through PayPal. Swagbucks is also completely legit, unlike a lot of the other rewards plugins out there. For example, you can get 4% cashback on Amazon purchases. Swagbucks inserts their affiliate code in your purchase and then shares the affiliate commission with you. Imagine a future where you use Price Alarm to find the lowest price for printer ink on Amazon, then use Swagbucks to get 4% cash back, and pay for the ink with a credit card that gives you 1% cashback. Swagbucks works on a point system. Every time you take an action that Swagbucks rewards, you get a certain amount of points that you can later redeem for Target or Amazon gift cards or real bucks. Make money doing things you’d normally do online. Awesome. 5. Ixigo Inspire — Saves money on travel I normally have a rule of thumb that I don’t download anything I can’t pronounce. However, some rules were meant to be broken — especially when there’s a deal too good to pass up. Enter ixigo inspire. This Chrome plug-in provides you with the best prices on any travel website when you visit them. Which is FANTASTIC for someone like me, since I’m normally splitting my time between San Francisco and NYC. A nice touch is that the extension will also change the background of each new Chrome tab to a photo of some exotic locale to really inspire you to travel more. Check it out. 5½. Use Amazon Assistant or Price Alarm to save money in stores Sometimes you need printer ink on a random Wednesday afternoon, and you can’t wait for some delivery guy to bring it to you. You can still save money using these plug-ins while shopping in a physical store. Many stores price match Amazon, like Staples. So when I ran out of HP 851 printer ink at the worst possible moment the other day, I went to Staples, pulled up the ink on Amazon Assistant, and showed the cashier the listing on my phone. They price matched the ink, saving me $16 instantly. Price in Staples: $63.99 Price on Amazon: $47.99 Savings: $16 (25%) Getting Ink Immediately: Priceless Automation is awesome Instead of spending days dragging yourself through the internet to buy something you want for a few bucks cheaper, automate the process with browser plug-ins that do the searching for you. This is why I love automation. But really, it’s only the beginning when it comes to how you should approach your spending and finances. I want to share with you something my team has spent a while working on to help you automate your expenses so you don’t have to worry about spending money on things you love. The best part: it’s absolutely free. Copyright 2017.

Mark Lovewell Government Business Nature & Science Oak Bluffs Faces Competing Plastic Bag Bylaw Proposals Alex Elvin Thursday, March 30, 2017 - 5:06pm Print 10 Comments Two competing bylaw proposals in Oak Bluffs this year may boil down to a difference of less than two thousandths of an inch. Voters at the annual town meeting in April will decide whether to join every other Island town in adopting a ban on single-use plastic bags in checkout lines, as drafted by the Vineyard Conservation Society, or opt for a similar but less stringent ban drafted by members of the Oak Bluffs business community this year. The VCS ban targets single-use plastic bags thinner than four thousandths of an inch, about the width of a human hair. Thinner bags without handles, such as those used for produce and bulk items, are exempt. Five Island towns adopted the bylaw by wide margins at their annual town meetings last year, with the Oak Bluffs selectmen delaying the vote in light of concerns by the business community. The alternative bylaw this year includes similar provisions, but targets bags thinner than 2.5 thousandths of an inch. The proposal also allows for biodegradable and compostable plastic bags, and includes a provision for businesses to defer for up to a year at a time, with board of health approval. Signe Benjamin, Joan Malkin, Samantha Look, Liz Witham, Nina Hitchen and Sakiko Isomichi of VCS. — Mark Lovewell “Both proposals are in agreement that those little flimsy grocery bags, they are not appropriate anymore and we can do better,” said Todd Rebello, a retail business owner who advocated for delaying the question last year. “The difference in the two articles at this point is the business one takes into account the unintended consequences of going too far with a ban.” The increased costs associated with the VCS proposal would likely eliminate the distribution of all single-use plastic bags in checkout lines, while the alternate proposal would allow businesses more flexibility. After tabling the VCS proposal last year, the selectmen set up a committee that included business owners, town officials and VCS members to try to reach a compromise. But an agreement couldn’t be reached before the deadline for submitting town meeting articles by petition, and VCS dropped out of the process. Selectman Gail Barmakian, who took part in the efforts, said the committee investigated municipal bag bans across the state, finding 20 others with a threshold of 2.5 thousandths of an inch, or 2.5 mils. “It’s much thicker than what we use now,” she said, adding that the bags would be less likely to blow away, and would cost less than those required under the VCS ban. But VCS and others say a threshold of 2.5 mils would fall short of their goals for protecting the environment. “It would be a pretty invisible change,” said VCS staff member Samantha Look, arguing that businesses would end up using just as many plastic bags as before, and that customers would not be encouraged to change their behavior. “The subset of businesses that have crafted this alternate [proposal] are very clear in the fact that they want to continue using plastic bags,” she said. She added that the Island lacks the appropriate infrastructure for handling compostable plastic bags, and that biodegradable plastic bags include unknown ingredients and require certain conditions to live up to their name. Advocates of the new proposal emphasize its benefits to small business owners who may not be able to afford switching to paper or thicker plastic, and to day-trippers and others who may end up struggling with paper bags and spilled groceries. “Most of these proposals are not aimed at mom and pop stores that are under 2,500 square feet,” Mr. Rebello said of other bans around the country. “Smaller businesses like my own don’t have the buying power of a Best Buy or a Walmart.” He said the added cost of paper or thicker plastic bags in Oak Bluffs would be passed on to the customer. Plastic bag bans have spread rapidly across the state, growing from about 16 when VCS began drafting its proposal in 2015, to more than 40 this year. Ms. Look said 12 additional towns in the state would be voting on bans this spring, with Boston working on a proposal of its own. A statewide ban is also in the works. Island health agents this week said the VCS ban has been rolling out smoothly, with down-Island towns issuing a number of one-year deferments so businesses can use up their existing stock. Edgartown has issued nine deferments, and Tisbury has issued four. Edgartown health agent Matt Poole said most of the deferments in his town related to paper bags, which under the VCS ban must be marked as recyclable and show the percentage of post-consumer recycled content. (The new proposal requires only the words “recyclable” or “please recycle.”) Ms. Barmakian argued that Oak Bluffs is something of an outlier, with four different boatlines arriving every day in the summer, and the only non-chain grocery store on the Island. “It is very much a resort town, where there are lots of day people that are coming off the boats and may not be prepared,” she said. Mr. Rebello noted that many day trippers are seniors or people who arrive on buses. “For us to give them paper, it’s not going to make it through the day,” he said. He also argued that without plastic bags, take-out restaurants would use more plastic and styrofoam containers, which could fill up trash barrels in town. But others sought to put the business angle into perspective. Nina Carter, who lives in Oak Bluffs year-round and has been active in promoting the VCS initiative, including through a program at the town library this winter, said only a handful of businesses were now pushing for the alternate ban. “It’s definitely a minority,” she said. She noted a perception in town that the VCS proposal had been imposed from outside, but she encouraged Oak Bluffs to get on board with the rest of the Island. “We are one Island, and the rest of the Island spoke clearly that they wanted a change,” she said. “I think that Oak Bluffs should be taking that into consideration as well.” It’s unclear how the dueling proposals will play out at the town meeting, although town moderator Jack Law said this week that he would likely allow discussion of both articles, followed by a vote on the alternate proposal. If the motion carries, he said, the VCS proposal would be tabled indefinitely. Otherwise, it too would come to a vote. Mr. Rebello said he didn’t expect very much debate at the town meeting, and he was confident that one of the two articles would pass. “Plastic bag bans in most places are hard to stop,” he said. “But there are consequences and you have to discuss the consequences.” plastic bag ban Oak Bluffs town meeting Comments (10) Steve, Falmouth Ban 'em all!!

March 30, 2017 - 9:52pm reply Brian C Smith, Oak Bluffs Perhaps at town meeting we can amend the plastic bag article to replace the bag verbiage with eliminating nips. That would truly have a positive local impact rather than some dubious environmental impact. March 30, 2017 - 9:56pm reply Steve, Falmouth Nips too!!!!

We got rid of leaded gas, we added seatbelts, etc. It's ok to change habits so we don't see the omnipresent platic bags blowing around our island. We're not talking about real hardship here. March 31, 2017 - 8:29am reply Liz, Aquinnah OK OB, it's time to step up to the plate. The "business" bylaw you've drafter this past year is worse than no bylaw because it would result in more plastic entering the waste stream. The VCS bylaw is the bylaw that every other town on the island has adopted. Other island businesses are stepping up to the plate and doing their part. Kudos also to the OB businesses who have already made the transition. It's the right thing to do, and the time is now. March 31, 2017 - 12:10pm reply Mike, Vineyard haven Bio degradable bags. They are out. Go UMAINE in Orno. My son has been a pioneer in this and is doing an incredible job. Soon all plastics will be this way March 31, 2017 - 3:14pm reply Vineyard Conservation Society While we appreciate the extensive research that went into this article, we can’t help but feel that the first sentence does a real disservice to the rest of the story. No, the decision before voters really doesn’t “boil down to a difference of less than two thousandths of an inch.” This decision is about whether or not you want stores in Oak Bluffs to continue providing disposable plastic bags at checkout. The purpose of the bylaw created by VCS (article 44) is to end that, while the purpose of the other bylaw (article 45) is to allow it. THAT is what all the language about bag thickness and exceptions for supposedly “eco-friendly” plastic really boils down to.

Idaho Business Health Nation World Elections Photos Business The entire coal industry employs fewer people than Arby’s FRIDAY, MARCH 31, 2017, 8:35 P.M. By Christopher Ingraham Washington Post Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS “My action today is the latest in a series of steps to create American jobs and to grow American wealth,” President Donald Trump said earlier this week before a group of coal miners. Trump was announcing the rollback of several Obama-era environmental regulations that would have affected industries such as coal mining. Trump has repeatedly claimed that over-regulation has led to a decline in coal-industry jobs. “I made them this promise,” Trump said at the signing. “We will put our miners back to work.” Experts in the industry have already pointed out, repeatedly, that the coal jobs are extremely unlikely to come back. The plight of the coal industry is more a function of changing energy markets and increased demand for natural gas than anything else. Another largely overlooked point about coal jobs is that there just aren’t that many of them relative to other industries. There are various estimates of coal-sector employment, but according to the Census Bureau’s County Business Patterns program, which allows for detailed comparisons with many other industries, the coal industry employed 76,572 people in 2014, the latest year for which data is available. That number includes not just miners but also office workers, sales staff and all of the other individuals who work at coal-mining companies. Although 76,000 might seem like a large number, consider that similar numbers of people are employed by, say, the bowling (69,088) and skiing (75,036) industries. Other dwindling industries, such as travel agencies (99,888 people), employ considerably more. Used-car dealerships provide 138,000 jobs. Theme parks provide nearly 144,000. Car wash employment tops 150,000. Looking at the level of individual businesses, the coal industry in 2014 (76,572) employed about as many as Whole Foods (72,650), and fewer workers than Arby’s (close to 80,000), Dollar General (105,000) or J.C. Penney (114,000). The country’s largest private employer, Wal-Mart (2.2 million employees), provides roughly 28 times as many jobs as coal. If anything, the numbers above overestimate the jobs impact of coal relative to other industries. Since 2014 the coal industry has shrunk further, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, to 50,300 employees as of February 2017. The point isn’t that coal jobs don’t matter – they matter to the people who have them and to the communities they support, especially as they typically pay far more than do jobs in the retail and service industries. But if you’re looking to make a meaningful increase in the number of jobs available to U.S. workers, bringing back coal jobs isn’t going to do it. There’s also a larger economic debate about coal’s impact on the economy, given the large role it plays in generating the nation’s electricity. But while the industry’s impact is large, its payrolls aren’t. The other thing about coal is that unlike retail and other industries, coal is highly concentrated in certain regions. When coal mines shut down, towns go under. National media send reporters and TV crews to those towns, and the resulting coverage can make coal’s impact on national employment levels feel much larger than it actually is. That national impact is only likely to get smaller, regardless of Trump’s actions. Even a quarter-century ago, the coal industry employed only 131,000 people. If Trump were to somehow bring all those jobs back, there’d still be more people employed by the retail shoe sales industry (224,000).

REUTERS/Carlos Barria By Christopher Ingraham, the Washington Post Mar 31, 2017 at 9:58 pm | Print View “My action today is the latest in a series of steps to create American jobs and to grow American wealth,” President Donald Trump said earlier this week before a group of coal miners.

There are various estimates of coal-sector employment, but according to the Census Bureau’s County Business Patterns program, which allows for detailed comparisons with many other industries, the coal industry employed 76,572 people in 2014, the latest year for which data is available. That number includes not just miners but also office workers, sales staff and all of the other individuals who work at coal-mining companies. Although 76,000 might seem like a large number, consider that similar numbers of people are employed by, say, the bowling (69,088) and skiing (75,036) industries. Other dwindling industries, such as travel agencies (99,888 people), employ considerably more. Used-car dealerships provide 138,000 jobs. Theme parks provide nearly 144,000. Carwash employment tops 150,000. Looking at the level of individual businesses, the coal industry in 2014 (76,572) employed about as many as Whole Foods (72,650), and fewer workers than Arby’s (close to 80,000), Dollar General (105,000) or J.C. Penney (114,000). The country’s largest private employer, Wal-Mart (2.2 million employees) provides roughly 28 times as many jobs as coal. If anything the numbers above overestimate the jobs impact of coal relative to other industries. Since 2014 the coal industry has shrunk further according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, to 50,300 employees as of February 2017. The point isn’t that coal jobs don’t matter — they matter to the people who have them and to the communities they support, especially as they typically pay far more than do jobs in the retail and service industries, But if you’re looking to make a meaningful increase in the number of jobs available to U.S. workers, bringing back coal jobs isn’t going to do it. Of course, part of the fixation on coal is because mining has always loomed large in the American imagination. There’s something mysterious and ennobling about the dangerous endeavor to extract valuable commodities from deep within the earth, something that’s missing from, say, used-car sales or ski-lift operation. There’s also a larger economic debate about coal’s impact on the economy, given the large role it plays in generating the nation’s electricity. But while the industry’s impact is large, its payrolls aren’t. The other thing about coal is that unlike retail and other industries, coal is highly concentrated in certain regions. When coal mines shut down, towns go under. National media sends reporters and TV crews to those towns, and the resulting coverage can make coal’s impact on national employment levels feel much larger than it actually is. That national impact is only likely to get smaller, regardless of Trump’s actions. Even a quarter-century ago, the coal industry employed only 131,000 people. If Trump were to somehow bring all those jobs back, there’d still be more people employed by the retail shoe sales industry (224,000). Like what you're reading?

With only a couple of months to go before the film hits the big screen, marketing for Wonder Woman is in full swing, and that means more than just trailers and promo shots. Fans of the iconic DC character are also getting treated to a whole slew of toys and collectibles tied into the film, and these figures are starting to hit shelves this spring. One of the LEGO Wonder Woman sets has already been revealed, sparking speculation about the role that Ares may play in the film, given that his figure is featured prominently on the box. We have also seen popular Funko Pop! Vinyl figures from the film, including Diana in period costume and in her Amazonian outfits. Now, another toy line has been announced, along with the reveal of two figures that will be part of the dolls on offer. The toys are figurines of Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) in the turtleneck and jacket we have seen in trailers, as well as Wonder Woman in her Themyscira dress and sandals, holding a sword. The image, revealed by THR, shows the dolls out of the box, so there is no info on packaging, or on other figures that may also be in the same line. These figures are part of a line from Warner Brothers and Mattel, which will debut exclusively at Wal-Mart for the month of April. In May, more Wonder Woman toys are on the way at the retail giant, including products by Jakks Pacific, Funko and Fisher-Price.   This is fairly standard for merchandise marketing related to a blockbuster film, with retailers and studios creating demand with a big roll-out and exclusive items. Hot Topic routinely has exclusive Pop! Vinyl figures, as do conventions and other retails outlets. Warner Bros. Consumer Products president Pam Lifford said of the rollout: We’re thrilled to bring Wonder Woman front and center to retailers worldwide in support of her first solo feature film. WBCP has developed an incredible assortment of trend-right products in collaboration with our best-in-class licensees, allowing fans of all ages to express their fandom and bring Wonder Woman’s empowerment, inspiration and beauty to life. More images of upcoming tie-in toys for the movie are sure to be revealed in the coming months as the marketing ramps up ahead of the film’s release, and for once, there can be no doubt that the merchandise will heavily feature a female superhero!

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 April 2017 by Military News Terra Tech Corp Reports Record Revenues for Year End December 31, 2016 and Issues Revenue Guidance for 2017 of $38 – $40 Million /EINPresswire.com/ — IRVINE, CA–(Marketwired – March 31, 2017) – Terra Tech Corp. (OTCQX: TRTC) („Terra Tech” or the „Company”), a vertically integrated cannabis-focused agriculture company, today announced its financial results for the year ending December 31, 2016. Financial Summary for Full Year 2016 Total revenues for the full year 2016 were $25.33 million, an increase of 154% from $9.98 million in the year ended December 31, 2015; Total revenues generated for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 were approximately $7.13 million, an increase of 229% from $2.17 million in the same period in 2015. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2016 amounted to approximately 10.2%, compared to approximately 10.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 amounted to approximately $20.72 million, compared to approximately $9.83 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The net loss attributable to Terra Tech for the year ended December 31, 2016 was approximately $26.92 million or ($0.07) per share compared to a loss of approximately $9.23 million or ($0.04) per share for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in net loss is primarily attributable to an increase in sales, general and administrative expenses, an increase in other income (expense), and an increase in the loss associated with the issuance of convertible debt and warrants during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year. The Company had $9.75 million in cash as of December 31, 2016. Stockholders’ equity for the year ended December 31, 2016 amounted to approximately $52.15 million, an increase of approximately $45.81 million compared to approximately $6.34 million as of December 31, 2015. Short-term debt as of December 31, 2016 amounted to approximately $564,000, compared with approximately $917,000 as of December 31, 2015. Long term debt increased from zero to $1.35 million during 2016, due to additional borrowings used for working capital and capital expenditures. „2016 was a watershed year for both Terra Tech and the U.S. cannabis industry,” said Derek Peterson, Chief Executive Officer of Terra Tech. „We made significant progress establishing a strong retail presence in our key target markets by acquiring Blum, Oakland in California and opening of a total of four medical cannabis dispensaries in Nevada. This was also the first full year selling our proprietary IVXX-branded premium medical cannabis products, and we were pleased to see IVXX sales have ramped up throughout the year as our marketing campaign gained momentum and new IVXX-branded products were launched. IVXX products are now sold in 225 dispensaries across California and Nevada, compared with the 200 dispensaries that stocked IVXX at the end of 2015. These efforts contributed to revenues of $25 million, representing year-over-year growth of 154%, exceeding the financial guidance set at the start of the year. „We reached these milestones at a time when the cannabis industry was undergoing a significant shift toward legalization, which resulted in more than half of the states in the U.S. now having comprehensive medical cannabis laws and eight states and the District of Columbia having legalized recreational cannabis in some form. The passing of recreational cannabis ballots in Nevada and California opened significant markets to us and we are confident that our 2016 progress has positioned Terra Tech as a market-leading cannabis company, paving the way for strong growth in the business in 2017 and beyond.” Mr. Peterson concluded, „Of note in 2016, we also expanded our Edible Garden produce lines of natural, USDA Certified Organic herbs and vegetables. This subsidiary continues to provide meaningful revenues and steady cash flow to the Company to support its growth. We look forward to continued, long-term, sustainable value creation for Terra Tech’s shareholders, customers and employees.” Operational Highlights for Full Year 2016 Cannabis Segment Updates: The Company established a retail presence in the states of California and Nevada during 2016. In the fourth quarter 2016, the Company opened two Nevada-based medical cannabis dispensaries. This follows the purchase of one dispensary in Oakland, California and the opening of two dispensaries in Las Vegas, Nevada, during the first nine months of 2016. In the fourth quarter 2016, Terra Tech was granted a license to open a medical cannabis dispensary and production facility in San Leandro, California. This is expected to open in 2017. Terra Tech’s wholly owned subsidiary, IVXX, launched two lines of pre-filled, IVXX-branded medical cannabis cartridges; the „Z35” cannabis oil cartridge line in April, 2016 and the „Z92” cartridges in June, 2016. Edible Garden Updates: Increased number of Edible Garden retailers to 1,900 on December 31, 2016, from 1,800 on December 31, 2015. In the fourth quarter, Edible Garden added two contract farmers to its cooperative of local growers of fresh and local produce. This brings the Company’s national contract farmer count to eight, compared with six at December 31, 2015. In the fourth quarter 2016, Edible Garden installed an additional acre of its hydroponic Dutch movable table system. This move toward automation is expected to lead to increased productivity and gross margins at Edible Garden in 2017. Edible Garden expanded its product line to include SUPERLEAF™, a nutritionally-enhanced lettuce variety developed in conjunction with Rutgers University, as well as potted living herbs and various vitamin and dietary supplement lines aimed at the healthy-living market. Edible Garden®, received the following certifications in 2016: USDA Certified Organic, The Non-GMO Project certification, the Kosher Certification. Edible Garden participated in the New York Produce Show and Conference in December, 2016. 2017 Guidance Revenue guidance for the full year 2017 is $38-40 million. The predicted increase in year-over-year revenue is expected to be driven largely by sales from the Company’s retail dispensaries in California and Nevada, as well as continued growth of the IVXX brand throughout the California and Nevada markets and increased sales at Edible Garden.

The picture looked rosy until last week. After the election, stocks soared on expectations that tax cuts would ignite an economic boom. The nonpartisan Tax Foundation was estimating that the Republican tax plan would lift wages nearly 8 percent and produce 1.7 million new jobs over the decade. Harvard economist Robert Barro was predicting Trump’s overall economic agenda could boost the nation’s annual growth rate from 2 percent to as much as 4 percent. But when House Republicans failed to pass the ObamaCare repeal last week, it set off alarms that the Trump administration might lack the moxie to deliver its agenda. As with health care, the path to tax reform is littered with landmines. Here’s how Trump can sidestep them and succeed. 1) Pass corporate-tax cuts first to fire up the economy. The House GOP plan includes corporate-tax cuts, breaks for most individuals and something new: a “border adjustment tax.” If Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin wants to get tax reform done by August, he needs to pare down this agenda, putting off individual tax reforms and border issues for next year. Otherwise expect TV ads against “tax cuts for the rich” to make some moderate GOP lawmakers go wobbly. Worse, a border adjustment tax will be lobbied to death because it creates winners and losers in every industry. Instead, start with what has universal GOP support: reducing America’s corporate-tax rates — the highest in the developed world. The GOP plan slashes rates from 35 percent to 20 percent — Trump is pushing for 15 percent — and allows companies to write off investments in equipment and factories immediately instead of over several years. Economist Larry Kudlow calls these changes “growth propellants.” To accelerate the impact, lawmakers can make the cuts retroactive to Jan. 1, 2017. 2) Trump should take the lead. Last week’s health reform failure shows the House GOP is not up to passing tough legislation on its own. Yet already, the gang that couldn’t shoot straight when it came to repealing ObamaCare is demanding the president rely on its version of tax reform, as House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R.-TX) urged Sunday. Fortunately, the White House quickly countered that Trump is “driving the train on this.” 3) Beware of the border tax. To raise $1 trillion to pay for the tax cuts, the GOP is flirting with a 20 percent levy on all imports, and a break for US companies that export. Trump initially labeled the idea “too complicated.” His instincts are spot on. Too many winners. Too many losers. Oil drillers win. Refiners lose. Detroit wins. Car dealers selling imports lose. Japanese automakers are already considering moving production facilities to the United States if the border tax passes, so factory workers here benefit. But consumers pay a lot more at Walmart. With so much at stake, no wonder eight GOP senators are balking, including Tom Cotton of Arkansas, home of Walmart. Yet House Speaker Paul Ryan, who resisted changes to his ObamaCare-repeal bill, is making the same mistake again. He says border tax opponents “simply don’t understand how it works.” 4) Tolerate deficits, short term. Ryan and fellow deficit hawks insist tax cuts have to be offset with tax hikes or spending cuts immediately, If President Ronald Reagan had hamstrung himself like that, there would have been no Reagan economic revolution. As the Tax Foundation confirms, tax cuts spur growth and ultimately yield more revenue. 5) Regrettably, don’t count on Democrats. Sen. Chuck Schumer has already ruled out supporting a tax break for “profitable and powerful corporations.” Never mind they provide half the private-sector jobs in America. While Dems squabble over how to divvy up the economic pie, Trump and Republicans are trying to grow a bigger one. If you work for a living, it will mean more money in your wallet.

Canadian retailers, consumers shifting to cards, apps Chuck Chiang More from Chuck Chiang Published on: March 31, 2017 | Last Updated: March 31, 2017 3:42 PM PDT Elle O'Brien works in Kit and Ace, an upscale action clothing store in Kitsilano. The company is one of the few retailers that have gone solely to cashless payment. Mark van Manen / PNG Share Adjust Comment Print Shoppers looking for the cash register to pay for their purchases at Vancouver’s Kit and Ace active apparel stores in Gastown and Kitsilano will find a complete absence of banknotes. The Vancouver-based brand — founded in 2014 by family members of Lululemon Athletica founder Chip Wilson — is one of the most notable cases of retailers abandoning bills and coins, which some observers have heralded as “the beginning of the end” for cash transactions in Canadian society. In September, payment technology company Moneris said in a report that cash will make up only 10 per cent of the money spent in Canada by 2030, with credit or debit card payments and mobile solutions like Apple Pay making up the vast majority of day-to-day transactions. Rob Cameron, chief product officer at Moneris, said the adoption of cashless payment is accelerating as technologies like contactless (or “tap”) transactions gain wider adoption among merchants. As of 2014, cash still made up 35 per cent of Canadian transactions, but Moneris’s survey showed younger shoppers increasingly moving to alternatives. “I think if anything, the 10-per-cent projection is conservative,” Cameron said. “If cash gets small enough … more retailers may start turning it off. We are already seeing that; we’re seeing the airlines do that, we’re seeing parking do that, and we are seeing some quick-serve retailers starting to do it.” Observers say the move to cashless transaction is being driven by merchants and consumers. For the consumer, it is the convenience of tapping a card and being quickly on one’s way. For businesses, tapping is far more efficient than handling change and it’s even more efficient than traditional card payment methods like chip-and-PIN, meaning they can handle more customers in the same time. “We chose this route because, as a brand, Kit and Ace is forward-thinking and driven by innovation, and our spaces are designed to offer a seamless, efficient shopping experience,” said company spokeswoman Anna Cordon, who said the company’s 60-plus stores in North America, Great Britain and Australia are all cashless. “We merchandise our product intuitively — smallest pant sizes on the lowest shelf to correlate with customers’ height — we don’t have phones on the shop floor, and we don’t accept cash,” she said, adding that customers have primarily been positive, despite some adjustments. “Our goal is to save people time and remove clutter while shopping.” There are no laws preventing retailers from refusing cash. Some industries, such as airlines’ inflight merchandise and food sales, have taken particularly to cashless payments. A statement from WestJet said airlines also appreciate the efficiency of not having flight attendants handle cash, allowing them to focus on service. Moneris’s Cameron said that when contactless cards became widespread in 2013, they took over one-in-five transactions in a single year. The company expects half of this year’s Canadian transactions to be tap-based. The total disappearance of cash, however, is highly unlikely, financial analysts say. Even as more and more people embrace the convenience of cashless technology, tangible banknotes and coins remain a source of direct contact and trust for many merchants and shoppers, said Hendrix Vachon, an economist with Desjardins Group, the Montreal-based association of credit unions. Vachon was the author of a Dejardins report last year that suggested Canada should abolish the nickel in the next five years. Oddly, that suggestion is really aimed at strengthening cash in the facing of competition from high-tech alternatives. “The idea behind that change (that) we propose is that it’s a way to control the cost of cash, because there are costs,” Vachon said, noting the production, handling, calculating and transport of coins and banknotes all cost money for governments and financial institutions using them, thus discouraging their use.

Joseph Marranca Photographer 2016. / Moneris The Desjardins report also suggested dropping the quarter for a 20-cent coin, effectively making all cash transactions’s cent-count end in zero, in the same way that the elimination of the penny limited the count to either be either five or zero. Such efficiencies, Vachon said, would allow cash to survive the onslaught by cashless methods. Such moves are crucial, since — while many consumers and shops are going cashless and using mobile devices, cards or the Internet to purchase — there remains a large segment of the Canadian population that depends on cash. “There’s an argument to having universal access to a method of payment,” Vachon said. “The numbers show us that the percentage of access to the Internet in Canada is 87 per cent; that means there are more than 10 per cent of the Canadian population that don’t have access. “Maybe older people have difficulty adapting to new technology, and lower-income persons don’t have the same access to that technology. If you consider all those factors, it’s hard to believe one day that cash would totally disappear.” Cameron argues, however, that touchless is starting to convert older Canadians as well. He points to Moneris’s survey figures that show 49 per cent of respondents 65 and older prefer to use tap payments — a number higher than the 48 per cent of those aged 55 to 64 who prefer the method. Payment using a smartphone app. Handout/Moneris / PNG “My dad, when he discovered tap, he said, ‘Wow, I figured out that I just tap my card and move. I don’t need my PIN, and it’s super fast,’” Cameron said. “And he’s almost 80 years old. Once you do it once, you realize it’s easier. And for lots of elderly Canadians, it is actually easier than trying to figure out the PIN pad.” The biggest resistance to going cashless — especially credit cards and mobile apps — has come from small businesses. Laura Jones, executive vice-president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, noted at least 1.5 per cent of any transaction using a credit card goes to the credit card company (such as Visa or Mastercard), and premium cards like Infinite Avion cards cost store owners much more. “For a small business on a slim margin, these can be big costs,” Jones said. “Customers are usually very aware of their own fees, but they are often unaware (that) when a business takes credit card transactions, business owners are paying fees, as well.” She added resistance is not limited to independent stores. Last year, Walmart Canada stopped accepting Visas at stores in Manitoba and Thunder Bay, Ont., because of a dispute that ended in January. Jones added many stores have fought back, either working through CFIB to lobby Ottawa or educating customers with signs encouraging cash payment — sometimes by offering extras (like a cookie, in the case of one Lower Mainland tea shop) for avoiding credit cards. “The good news is, the climate is getting better, and the cost of accepting credit cards is coming down,” Jones said, noting Mastercard has recently agreed to give CFIB members rates similar to what the company charges Walmart, a saving of 12.5 per cent for the small businesses. “However, we still hear concerns from small businesses that costs are high, and they continue to ask customers to consider alternatives.” There are also concerns that cash is important to tax avoiders and supports a “black-market” economy of cash-only transactions. Such cases have been reported in other Western nations like Australia, where the Sydney Morning Herald’s Tony Featherstone wrote last March that many Australian small businesses “flout” tax rules by using cash. Vachon agrees that reducing tax evasion is a key reason for promoting cashless transactions, but noted of the $80 billion of Canadian banknotes in circulation, half are in $100 bills, indicating that eliminating the large bill itself may be enough to end much of the black-market economy, without having to eliminate cash completely. “There are several reasons some people prefer to use cash,” he said, noting that he has heard anecdotes about Quebec residents saving up more cash after the ice storms of 1998, which rendered some households without electricity for months. Similarly, experts in B.C. often advise people to keep cash handy in their home earthquake kits. “Many people feel it’s useful to keep some bill notes in their back pocket as a rainy-day reserve, just in case the other systems stop working. There is trust in something you can feel physically.” chchiang@postmedia.com CLICK HERE to report a typo. Is there more to this story?

Smith, who received a life sentence in 1987, battled in the courts for five years for a DNA test that won his exoneration. He later returned to the courthouse to receive compensation for his prison time. He recovered from the ordeals of his youth to marry and settle into everyday life. He also became a respected champion of the innocence movement in Texas. Smith, 65, died March 25 of lung cancer at Methodist Charlton Medical Center. He received a diagnosis of stage IV cancer in February. Services will be at 11 a.m. Saturday at These Are They Community Church, 200 S. Polk St. in DeSoto. Burial will be in Lincoln Memorial Park in Dallas. Since he was freed in 2006, Smith had worked diligently to help those unjustly imprisoned, said Gary Udashen, board president of the Innocence Project of Texas. "He was somebody who was really well respected among everybody involved in this work," Udashen said. Smith worked with other exonerees, spoke at seminars for lawyers and frequently lobbied the Texas Legislature. "He was very engaging and was really impressive," Udashen said. In January, Smith met with Dallas County District Attorney Faith Johnson to introduce her to other exonerees. He asked Johnson to support a bill that would require police interrogations to be videotaped, Udashen said. Smith found happiness as an exoneree. He was 57 when he married Emely Kaye Hunter, who had three children from a previous marriage. During his imprisonment, Smith longed for a normal life, said his wife, who lives in Glenn Heights. "He said he always would pray that God would give him a family," she said. "He said that he just wanted a normal life with a family that he could love and would love him." Smith became like a father to his stepchildren. "They have their father, but when they have problems or issues, they would talk to him ... before they would go to their dad. Once they got to know him, they called him every day, just to say, 'Hey Dad, how you doing?' " Smith was born in Sherman and grew up in Dallas, where he attended L.G. Pinkston High School. He did electrical work, but by age 34, he also had convictions for car theft and robbery. One night in the summer of 1986, a woman was abducted from an north Oak Cliff apartment and raped at knife point in a nearby field. The victim described the assailant to her boyfriend, who was manager of the apartment complex. Later that night, a police officer banged on the door of Smith's sister's apartment, where he was sleeping on the couch. The officer asked Smith to step out on the balcony, where the victim, on the ground below, identified him as her attacker. "That was the first time I saw her," Smith said in 2008. "The second time I saw her was in court." Smith also said that at the time, he owed the apartment manager $250 from a drug deal. In 1987, Smith was convicted of aggravated sexual assault and sentenced to life. No physical evidence implicated him, and no eyewitnesses were presented during trial. The victim has since been convicted of robbery and prostitution. In 2001, Smith requested DNA testing to prove is innocence. He battled the Dallas County district attorney's office for years before the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ruled in his favor. Smith had just been out of prison for about six months when he met his future wife at a Walmart. "He stopped me and asked my name," she said. "He gave me his number and asked me if I would call him." Several months later, she called and they set up a dinner date at a Denny's restaurant. She liked his easy-going manner. "Later on, I found out how good a heart he had," she said. "He was always trying to help other people." It was difficult for Smith to approach her for a date, she recalled. "He said he was afraid to talk to women or get to know them because of the false rape charges," she said. "He said there was just something about me that he knew that I was the one." The couple married on Sept. 19, 2009. Smith's sister, Elizabeth Smith, died three years ago. In addition to his wife, Smith is survived by his sister, Nettie Smith of DeSoto; stepdaughters, Monica Hunter and Diondala "Dee" Wooten, both of Grand Prairie; a stepson, Marcus Hunter of Tyler; five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. Memorial contributions may be made to the Innocence Project of Texas.
