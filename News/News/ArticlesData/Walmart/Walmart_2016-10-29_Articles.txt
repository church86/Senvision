BUTLER – After spending several years in the 1960’s and 1970’s perfecting the art of German wine-making, Ken Starr opened Starr Hill Vineyard & Winery in 2005. (Provided photo) Based in Curwensville, Starr Hill Vineyard & Winery now has stores located inside four Wal-Mart locations, making it one of the first wineries to be located inside the largest retailer in the United States. Starr Hill Vineyard & Winery approached Wal-Mart several years ago, and in 2012, they were approved by the commonwealth of Pennsylvania to open a maximum of five retail stores. In addition to the Butler store, other Wal-Mart locations include Altoona, Clearfield and DuBois. “This is a great opportunity to showcase our wines in a huge marketplace and to a large number of new customers,” said Starr. “Thousands of people go through the Butler store each month, and I couldn’t be more excited to introduce our wines and give customers such a unique shopping experience.” Starr Hill Vineyard & Winery will be hosting a ribbon cutting event with the Butler County Chamber of Commerce at the new store inside the local Butler Wal-Mart on Wednesday, Nov. 9 at 4 p.m. About Starr Hill Vineyard & Winery In 1994, Starr purchased property in Curwensville and planted 12 vines. By 1998, there were more than 3,000 vines and in 2005, Starr decided to start making his wine commercially. Starr Hill Vineyard & Winery located on 13 acres in Clearfield County produces more than 40 varieties of delicious, award-winning wines. Starr Hill Vineyard & Winery is located at 861 Bailey Rd., in Curwensville and is sold at four Wal-Mart locations in Pennsylvania. Starr Hill Vineyard is a member of Butler County Tourism & Convention Bureau. For more information, visit StarrHillWinery.com or call 814-236-0910 or VisitButlerCounty.com.

Police say the incident happened around 10 p.m. at the Walmart at 14000 Worth Avenue. The video shows two men picking up the victim, possibly a younger African-American man, and shoving him into the trunk of a car right outside of the store. Once the victim is locked in the trunk, the suspects get inside of the car and drive away. According to police, additional surveillance video shows the suspect vehicle driving next to the victim before the incident and that the victim seemed to be talking with the suspect driving the car. Witnesses told police that the victim and suspects might have been “play fighting” before the victim was forced into the truck.

Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today Roman Catholic lay organisations have called out two major American retailers for selling costumes for this year's Halloween that are supposedly offensive to priests and nuns. According to a report from Life Site News, the Catholic group called American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property (TFP) recently issued a statement calling as "immoral" and "horrible" two Halloween costumes being sold on the websites of Amazon and Walmart. The two costumes being questioned depict a sexually excited priest and a pregnant nun. American TFP Vice President John Horvat said these costumes are "obscene" and "sickening." "Amazon and Walmart are selling Halloween costume sets that are directly targeted to offend Christians and mock religion," Horvat told Life Site News. The American TFP has also launched an online petition to condemn Amazon and Walmart's marketing of these offensive costumes, and calling these major retailers to pull out these products from the market. In the online petition, which has so far garnered about 17,000 signatures, the Catholic group noted how these two mega retailers have removed some products in their line — including those that offend Muslims, homosexuals and transgenders — because of public outcry. The Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights meanwhile called on Amazon and Walmart to treat the clergy with the same respect and consideration as it extends to other groups. Catholic League president Bill Donohue expressed concern on how the two retailers seem to have "no problem" offending Church workers. "There are no excuses for what Amazon is doing, but Walmart is worse," Donohue said. "It likes to tout itself as a "Christian-friendly" store, yet when it comes to Catholics, it drops its guard. It is not a good cultural sign when corporate elites are more sensitive to cross-dressers than they are to Catholics." Website links to the two offensive costumes are reportedly not working at times as of posting time.

The decline of my part of Ohio shows why ‘Some people here would vote for a Disney villain if they ran on the Republican ticket.’ A campaign sign in East Liverpool, Ohio, October 2016.

Some of them are my neighbours. I live in Meigs County, Ohio, which will probably vote for Trump if history is any indication. Its population, of 23,500 or so, has a per capita income of around $18,000, and 20% of my neighbours live below the poverty line. It’s one of those places where the coal dried up a few decades ago. And, however depressing it sounds, it’s better than it was. Inside a Donald Trump rally: good people in a feedback loop of paranoia and hate Read more The house my children will grow up in was built in 1900 by their paternal great-great-grandfather. It’s belonged to the family ever since, each generation building on as needed from its original single room. There are a few houses like that in the family, and we moved into this one mostly because we wanted our kids to grow up as he had, running barefoot through the woods and catching tadpoles in the stream behind the house. Meigs is still an old, old place like that. It’s not uncommon for friends our age to live in houses recently made available by a family death. We buy groceries from a general store, but it’s miles to the nearest gas station or supermarket. Some people here would vote for a Disney villain if they ran on the Republican ticket – party affiliation is an inherited trait in many families – some just like Trump. He “says what he’s thinking”, his supporters say, which baffles many observers, given what the man says, but makes perfect sense if you realise that most of my neighbours don’t pay nearly as much attention to politics as I, who’s writing this and you, who are reading it. Many people are uncomfortable with a lot of the stuff they’ve heard about him but accept it as a necessary evil: the main thing is to tell Washington elites that they’re not safe in their sinecures any more, that the common man is about to have his day. It’s all gone too far off the rails. Pomeroy, the county seat, lies just over the river from Mason, West Virginia. Walmart tried to come to Pomeroy but the council voted against it because they didn’t want to lose the small businesses lining the main street. The company went to Mason instead and pointedly positioned its store at the end of the bridge; Pomeroy’s intentionally quaint riverfront downtown now features a rundown laundromat, some bars, a liquor store, empty storefronts and a few improbably expensive shops. All the tax revenue from the Walmart goes to Mason. People talk about economic insecurity and usually they’re imagining some angry white man upset that someone somewhere (probably a minority, and a woman to boot) is getting more help than him. But I picture that Walmart, where it didn’t really matter what the people wanted. They made their stand; they got run over anyway. That’s a fair description of life in a place like this one. People who admire Trump for his business acumen are simply pointing out that no matter the ambiguity about his balance sheets this is a man who flies around on a gold-plated jet, which to someone making a few hundred dollars a week seems like unimaginable wealth. Our society values a human based on their material worth; why then are we surprised when many people define “winning” and “valuable” and “admirable” accordingly? Trump is a Rorschach test of America’s fears. To the ageing population here, his slogan about making America great again brings memories of last century, when the downtown bustled and anyone could make a solid living, assuming they weren’t too lazy to present themselves at the mine. It wasn’t ever an easy life, but it wasn’t ever this hard either. It’s difficult to remember, given everything that has happened since, but Trump exploded on to the stage with the first primary debate by telling us that the political system really is as rigged as we’d feared: that politics is about who you can buy and sell, whose influence you can tap. We have all known it; Trump said it. And that’s where he built his base. It’s been three years since I wrote a post online about America’s poverty trap that went viral and led to a book deal. I now have the luxury of paying attention to the world around me. But when I look at my hands I see the scars from knives and slicers and hot grease, and I remember the rage that I could not name after a decade and a half of low wages and no hope, because we all say that we live in a meritocracy and we all know it’s bullshit, but it keeps people sinking regardless. It was bound to happen that a candidate running on fear would take us this far into the realm of the unacceptable An unfortunate fact of capitalism, or at least the kind we practice in the western world, is that we below are turned against each other. There is political value in racial strife. As long as we can teach white people to hate nonwhite people, then we don’t have to worry about poor people realising they outnumber the rich ones. Racists came to love Trump because he speaks openly of the racial strife that politicians have been exploiting and stoking for decades to great electoral effect. That’s what people mean when they complain about political correctness, after all. You’re supposed to hate and fear a bunch of people but not talk about it, which is nonsensical except in the lens of politics, where perception matters far more than substance. Facebook Twitter Pinterest What a Donald Trump campaign rally reveals about America Trump can behave as badly as he wants. It’s no worse than people expect from the power elite. America, as seen from Meigs County, is a place where bankers can unfairly foreclose on your house and then get paid by Washington for doing it – and then Washington will demand you sign the bill. His business shenanigans don’t register as shocking because it’s assumed that to get even close to that level you’ve already sold your soul; that’s just how it works. None of the bankers went to jail, and now the banks pay Hillary Clinton the equivalent of 37 years of the median wage in this county per speech to lecture for them. The year 2016 will be political shorthand, in the way you can say “2008” and people think of Lehman and Bear and bailouts. There will be Before, and After. This year is forcing us to grapple with a lot of realities we’d been conscientiously avoiding. Trump will still walk away from this thing a winner by his lights if Clinton wins – not leader of anything, with a reputation left in pitiful dirty tatters, but as head demagogue. He’ll have millions of adoring fans and a revenue stream. He will avoid responsibility for what is to come. Pain and rage and fear and hate are all closely connected; unleashing them all in an unexamined pulsating mass of conspiracy-laden megalomania was ill-advised at best. We have already seen violence, and we will see more. It was bound to happen eventually that a candidate running on fear and division would take us this far into the realms of the unacceptable. We can’t stop it now. The only thing we can do – the thing we must do, if we are to save ourselves – is begin to understand that if the system is broken, it’s broken for enough of us that we can together insist on changes that suit the populace, instead of merely those candidates and donors who can afford to buy all the rivals they see on a primary stage. Few people think Trump will fix anything but a lot are willing to vote for him. Because whatever you think of him, he’s not a vote for the status quo.

Provided 1 of 2 i By Tobias Wall twall@bnd.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story An east coast-style soft pretzel joint wants to set up shop in Belleville. Philly Pretzel Factory plans to serve oven-fresh pretzels out of the Walmart at Green Mount Commons. Chief Development Officer Tom Monaghan said the company likes the prospect of being close to Southwestern Illinois College and within a shopping center. “The pretzels are great for students on-the-go while grocery shopping or headed to class,” Monaghan wrote in an email. “We’re excited to continue adding locations across Illinois, and we have seen great success in our Walmart stores. Belleville is a natural next step for our development process.” The Philadelphia-based chain currently operates around 150 franchised locations, mostly in Philadelphia and up and down the Atlantic coast but also as far inland as Indianapolis, Ind. and Copperas Cove, Texas. It’s not clear yet when the Factory could open. Monaghan wrote that the company is “actively seeking local franchise partners who are ingrained in the community.” Prime Shiloh ground changes hands The wheels are in motion for commercial development at the Three Springs at Shiloh after years of the 133-acre property sitting idle. Dierbergs Markets Inc. recently purchased the Three Springs at Shiloh development site, according to paperwork filed with the village of Shiloh. The purchase price has not been disclosed. The Shiloh Committee at Large unanimously approved Dierbergs’ request for an ordinance draft and setting of a public hearing during its meeting Oct. 24. The village board will vote on the measure Nov. 7. Currently, Three Springs at Shiloh has only one anchored tenant, American Eagle Credit Union, at 1153 Blue Springs Plz., which opened three years ago. The multi-use development was earmarked for commercial development since its inception in November 2008, but little movement has been made to attract businesses to the prime location — the intersection of Frank Scott Parkway and Green Mount Road. Two Sears stores to shutter The Sears Appliance and Hardware store at 2300 Troy Rd. in Edwardsville will be closing on Nov. 5, according to store manager Ken Campbell. He and the store’s 21 employees were told in September, he said. The Edwardsville location is not a big-box Sears, but a smaller hardware and appliance store. Another Sears Appliance and Hardwards — located at 501 Beltline Rd. in Collinsville — also will close. A manager at that location said the store’s last day would be in early December. Employee becomes owner of historic Worden bar The Yellow Dog Café & Bar — a mainstay in Worden since it was built in the late 1800s — has a new owner. But Nikki Schreiber-Settles is no newbie. She’s been a server and bartender at the joint for years. With the help of SIUE’s Metro East Small Business Development Center, Schreiber-Settles officially took over in May. “The SBDC is incredibly valuable to small business owners. If anyone hasn’t yet taken advantage of this no-cost service, it is truly their loss,” Schreiber-Settles said. “It’s a real landmark,” said Barbara Schreiber, Nikki’s mother and business partner. “The Yellow Dog was first built back in the late 1800s when the railroad was going through. It has been known by that name ever since. There are Worden residents in their eighties who say they can’t remember it ever being called anything else.” The Yellow Dog, located at 124 East Wall Street in Worden, is open daily from 6:30 a.m. to 2 a.m., with the kitchen closing at 9 p.m. On Saturday nights, closing time is 3 a.m. Tobias Wall: 618-239-2501, @Wall_BND Tobias Wall i Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Metro-East News Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:44 Man nearly burned inside of exploding car, escapes inferno Pause 2:39 Newly-elected St. Clair County Coroner Calvin Dye Sr. 0:26 Nov. 14 supermoon is closest moon to Earth since 1948 4:04 Blinded Belleville policeman Jon Brough talks about his struggles, triumphs 2:48 Red sweater Internet sensation Ken Bone reflects on debate, celebrity 1:56 Ken Bone casts his ballot Tuesday morning in Shiloh 1:14 Tammy the cat is good with kids and would make a great addition to your family 1:07 Edwardsville football coach talks playoff loss to Glenbard West 3:06 Mascoutah volleyball team celebrates third-place win at state 0:23 Slow motion: Did Mater Dei score winning points or not?

Gwen Ifill, pioneering broadcaster, PBS host, dies at 61 News Maryland Baltimore County Owings Mills As Owings Mills Mall disappears, questions loom about what will take its place New development revitalizing Owings Mills New development is revitalizing Owings Mills. (WJZ) New development is revitalizing Owings Mills. (WJZ) Pamela WoodContact ReporterThe Baltimore Sun Thirty years ago, Owings Mills Mall was posh and had a Saks Fifth Ave. Soon it could have a Walmart. At the opening of the Owings Mills Mall in 1986, politicians cracked champagne bottles on the brass stair rails and pink and turquoise feathers rained down from the skylights onto a throng of shoppers below. With a Saks Fifth Avenue department store and specialty retailers selling furs and designer clothes, the mall was celebrated as the high-end centerpiece of the emerging, affluent suburb. Thirty years later, workers have encircled the mall with screened fences and are tearing it down. Owings Mills Mall is now seen as a spectacular failure. Yet its demise hasn't slowed interest and retail growth in an area of the county still seen as an emerging hub. Even as tenants left the mall, developers were building the adjacent Metro Centre with office and retail space, and new apartments grew up next to the Metro station. About a mile and a half away, the sprawling Foundry Row center on Reisterstown Road opened last month with more than 350,000 square feet of retail space, anchored by a Wegmans grocery. At the opening of the Owings Mills Mall in 1986, politicians celebrated it as the high-end centerpiece of the emerging, affluent suburb. Thirty years later, workers have encircled the mall with screened fences and are tearing it down. Read more. Brian Gibbons, whose Owings Mills-based Greenberg Gibbons Commercial is redeveloping Foundry Row from the former Solo Cup factory, says he's "very bullish" on Owings Mills — an area with a median household income of more than $71,000, according to census data. The countywide median is $66,900. Kimco, the New York-based owners of Owings Mills Mall, say they're high on the area, too, and are planning to build a new open-air shopping center in its place.  Find out the latest news in Baltimore commercial development. But they've been mum on what tenants might be included, heightening concern amid residents, county officials and others who see the mall site's fate as critical to the future of Owings Mills. Baltimore County Councilman Julian Jones recently convened a pair of community meetings over rumors a Walmart superstore might anchor Kimco's new center. Jones, a Woodstock Democrat who represents the mall area, said residents told him loud and clear they don't want a big Walmart — especially because there are already two Walmarts in the area in centers that could suffer or close if another opens. Walmart officials have said talk about a possible new store in Owings Mills is "speculation," and declined to comment further. Jones said he's "not very impressed" with what Kimco has revealed so far, and has urged them to build a high-quality project. "I want something nice," he said. "Whatever happens, we're going to live with it for the next 30 years." Still, he said, "the important thing for me is to make sure whatever happens there, that it be successful. "Right now I'm trying to work with [Kimco] to achieve the primary objective, which is to get it developed." A spokeswoman for County Executive Kevin Kamenetz said the county hopes Kimco will "aim higher than a Walmart superstore." "The county executive has communicated directly with Kimco on many, many occasions in recent weeks and months," spokeswoman Fronda Cohen said. "He really has told them he wants them to … create a quality development for the people of Owings Mills." The Owings Mills "fashion mall" opened to great fanfare 30 years ago, but the 1992 murder of Christina Marie Brown shook the public's confidence in the mall area. Brown, 28, was shot to death as she walked along a path from the mall to the Metro station. Nigel Antonio Carter, then 17, was sentenced to life in prison for the murder. The mall declined in the years that followed. High-end retailers left, to be replaced by mid-range stores. Saks Fifth Avenue left Owings Mills in 1996, followed by Sears in 2001 and Lord & Taylor in 2002. By September 2015, only a few stores remained. Kimco closed off the interior sections of the mall, leaving only Macy's and JC Penney open for business. Those stores closed, too, and demolition began this year. As far back as 2011, Kimco proposed working with then-owner General Growth Properties to "de-mall" the site and redevelop it. Kimco eventually gained sole control of the property and received preliminary approval from the county for an open-air center. No permits have been granted, but plans filed with the county show four possible variations. All involve two main rows of shops and vast parking. One plan includes a 12-story office tower and garage; two others include a gas station. No tenants have been named. Kimco officials have declined to answer questions, but said in a statement the company is "considering several different retail alternatives, including a new open-air power center concept that will enhance the available shopping options and compliment the surrounding community." The company said it is "encouraged by the considerable interest we've received from potential retailers at this early stage." Civic activists say they recognize high-end stores failed at Owings Mills Mall, but they don't think a Walmart-type store is right, either. Mark Stewart, president of the Reisterstown-Owings Mills-Glyndon Coordinating Council, says he wants to see something akin to Hunt Valley Towne Centre, where Greenburg Gibbons turned a moribund mall into an outdoor center. Stores should be nice, he said, but the mall experience proved consumers in the area won't support expensive retailers. George Harman, a past president of the Reisterstown-Owings Mills-Glyndon Coordinating Council who ran for county executive in 2014, noted the demise of Owings Mills Mall is not unique. Malls around the region and across the county have closed or undergone redevelopment. "It's really a shame to see the transitioning of all the malls," he said. But he noted that many, including Hunt Valley, have rebounded. Harman said there's room for "middle-of-the-road" restaurants and stores such as a Lowes or a Dick's Sporting Goods. "Mid-range is what I think Reisterstown, Randallstown and Owings Mills are looking for," he said. Baltimore Rising, a group that promotes economic development in the region, has opposed a big-box concept at the site. The group is calling on Jones to introduce legislation limiting store size on the property that could eliminate big-box retailers. The group's founder, Les Cohen, declined an interview request. Rival developers see promise at the mall property, but say they worry Kimco's plan will fall short. Gibbons, CEO of Greenberg Gibbons, said his company wanted to buy the site, but was rebuffed by Kimco. He thinks the mall property is ripe for a mix of homes, shops and offices, creating a "walkable community" linking to Metro Centre next door. "It's very important that whatever happens to the mall is complementary, and we don't take a step back," Gibbons said. Howard Brown, chairman of Owings Mills-based David S. Brown Enterprises, said he also tried to buy the mall property. His company is developing Metro Centre, and built a road connecting his project to the mall site. Kimco declined to comment on whether Greenberg Gibbons and David S. Brown attempted to buy the mall. Brown said a big-box, strip center is not what people want, and won't become the community focal point Owings Mills needs. With the explosion of online shopping, he said, customers aren't interested in browsing in giant stores. In-person shopping is moving to smaller stores, he said. Brown said he would rather see the former mall site become mix of single- and multifamily housing centered around Main Street-type shopping, with a park or pond as a neighborhood amenity. "The last thing it wants to be is boxes facing boxes," Brown said. "That's passé." Brown thinks county officials should take a role in nudging Kimco to be creative, possibly with legislation guiding what can be done with the property. "They have an opportunity now. The mall is gone," Brown said. "The county has an opportunity to create a walkable, bikeable downtown."

It was September 16 that Nintendo officially released this Pokemon GO accessory. According to IGN, Nintendo has since apologized for product shortages as fans of the game are going to Toys R Us, Walmart, GameStop, and other stores near them only to find out the game accessory has been sold out. “We launched the Pokemon Go Plus accessory on September 16th to provide a more comfortable play experience for Pokemon Go. Demand far exceeded our expectations and production has not caught up, leading to product shortages. We apologize to the consumers and distributors affected by this. We are planning to expand production as needed, and will continue to produce and ship additional units.” Nintendo has reassured Pokemon GO players that they will continue to produce and ship additional accessories until they meet the demand. Unfortunately, some Pokemon GO players may just be forced to wait as Toys R Us, Walmart, GameStop, and other stores near them slowly restock their shelves with additional accessories for the game. Kimishima on how Pokemon GO has boosted Pokemon 3DS, working to remedy Pokemon GO Plus shortages https://t.co/ATzUBWsT6d pic.twitter.com/AAmxhpcdAm — Nintendo Everything (@NinEverything) October 27, 2016 The question some Pokemon GO players have at this point is simple – is there a way to see if Toys R Us, Walmart, GameStop, and other stores near them have Pokemon GO Plus in stock before taking a trip to the store? These players are hoping to find out if Toys R Us and/or these other local stores have the game accessory in stock in order to avoid wasting a trip to the store only to find out the store does not have the accessory in stock when they get there.

Nintendo never told customers where Pokemon GO Plus was being sold, but any video game store or store with a video game and electronic department is a safe bet. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/py5Kj_NtXuU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> Most of the stores that sell the video game (such as Toys R Us, Walmart, or GameStop) will have store locators on their official websites. These store locators can be used to find stores near you. The store locator will also provide you with the phone number. Just give a few of the stores a call. If you find a store that has one in stock, see if they can set it aside for you. Impatient Pokemon GO players, who are not having any luck by checking local stores such as Toys R Us, can also resort to purchasing the game accessory online. It is, however, important to keep in mind that third party vendors selling Pokemon GO Plus through websites such as Amazon are going to be selling the accessory for more than retail price because of the demand. It is not uncommon for these vendors to purchase game and game accessories such as Pokemon GO Plus when they are in high demand and selling them at higher than retail price because they know some fans will be willing to pay more to get their hands on the product as soon as possible. Latest Pokémon GO Update Breaks GO Plus Accessory, Fix Already In The Works https://t.co/J3PxEC8ya9 #Mobile pic.twitter.com/7pXOis6V9J — Nintendo Life (@nintendolife) October 26, 2016 According to IGN, one of the biggest features Pokemon GO Plus will offer to players is not requiring the application to run on your phone in order to play the game. With this accessory, players do not have to stare at their screen or run the application. This will allow the battery on your smartphone to last longer and it makes it a lot easier for players to be aware of their surroundings while playing the game. In order to use the accessory with this special feature, you just have to open the application, sign into your account, and then put your phone on screen lock in order to conserve the battery power. Then, Pokemon GO Plus will notify you when there are Pokemon or PokeStops nearby. This way all players will have to do is press a button to collect the item or Pokemon that is nearby. Don't forget trainers, starting tomorrow October 30th, the #PokemonGo Plus accessory will return @ToysRUs stores! pic.twitter.com/X6uIVnkXnt — PokéSteal (@PokeSteal) October 29, 2016 Pokémon GO Plus restocks hitting Toys"R"Us on October 30th according to new Holiday Toy Guide. pic.twitter.com/GLYNAHHEq0 — Pokémon GO Wire (@PokeWire) October 24, 2016 For Pokemon GO players who have yet to get their hands on this gaming accessory, the Toys R Us Holiday Toy Guide revealed that all Toys R Us stores would be restocking their shelves with additional accessories today – October 30. Did you manage to get your hands on Pokemon GO Plus before it went out of stock in your area? Did you pay retail price or did you hop online and pay an inflated price to get your accessory?

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries e-Edition Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Woman sues Wal-Mart, debt collection service for 'robocalls' Sunday Oct 30, 2016 at 2:01 AM Nicki Gorny @Nicki_Gorny A Citrus County woman is suing Wal-Mart and a debt collection service it contracted based on the “ceaseless barrage of daily calls” she claims to have received. Sandra Laurentano, of Homosassa, argues in a complaint filed this month in the Ocala division of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida that Wal-Mart and Central Credit Services violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act through the “robocalls” it employed to contact her. Congress enacted the Telephone Consumer Protection Act in 1991 to ban the automated or pre-recorded calls, which it cast as a “nuisance” and “invasion of privacy.” An attorney for Laurentano indicated in the complaint that Wal-mart and Central Credit Services placed approximately 200 calls to her phone between November 2015 and October 2016. These apparently sought to recover a $350 debt. The complaint alleges that, through these calls, the defendants “intentionally harassed and abused (Laurentano) on numerous occasions by calling several times during day, and on back-to-back days, with such a frequency as can be reasonably expected to harass.” The complaint also references the Florida Consumer Collection Practices Act and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. It calls for a jury trial and award of statutory, punitive and actual damages. Laurentano is represented by the Consumer Protection Firm, based in Tampa, according to court records. — Contact Nicki Gorny at 352-867-4065, nicki.gorny@ocala.com or @Nicki_Gorny.

News Sports Entertainment Life Opinion Obituaries E-edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site 1985-Present 1831-1950 A La Carte: Philly Pretzel Factory opening next year in local Wal-Marts Saturday Oct 29, 2016 at 8:27 PM Natalie Morris Correspondent The PHILLY PRETZEL FACTORY hopes to enter the Illinois market with two locations operating in Springfield by summer 2017. “We like to say we’re looking for the pretzel mayor of Springfield,” said Tom Monaghan, chief development officer for the Philadelphia-based chain. “Illinois, specifically Springfield, has been identified as a target market and now we’re looking for franchise partners.” Desired locations already have been identified even while the soft pretzel business -- known for its “hot outta the oven” slogan -- is hunting prospective partners. Monaghan said the goal is to open sites inside Springfield’s Wal-Mart locations on North Dirksen Parkway and Sixth Street. Philly Pretzel Factory already has store-in-store locations in 31 Wal-Mart Supercenters.  The factory menu offers all things pretzel, including hand-twisted soft pretzels; mini pretzel nuggets known as Rivets; pretzels stuffed with hot dogs, spicy sausages or Philadelphia cheesesteak; pepperoni pretzel melts; and cinnamon coated pretzel twists. Founder Dan DiZio was only 11 when he began selling soft pretzels, organizing a crew of neighborhood kids to hawk his breads at busy intersections throughout Philadelphia. DiZio and partner Len Lehman opened the first brick-and-mortar location in 1998 in Mayfair, Pennsylvania. Today there are more than 150 locations throughout a dozen states. Philly Pretzel Factory isn’t the first dining chain to publicly announce interest in Springfield in an effort to locate franchise partners. Management for two pizza chains announced plans in 2015 to open in Springfield in an effort to drum up franchise partners. To date, neither the Wisconsin-based TOPPERS PIZZA nor the Georgia-based YOUR PIE have identified a location or named opening date. However, Monaghan said Philly Pretzel Factory historically identifies franchise partners within 60 to 90 days of announcing a target market. * Online ordering is now available at PIE’S THE LIMIT’s newest location at 1710 S. MacArthur Blvd. Customers can either order through the restaurant’s website at PiestheLimit.com or text “LIMIT” to 33733. The service already was available at the original location in Parkway Pointe, which celebrates its first anniversary this month. The MacArthur Boulevard business opened in September. The Springfield-based, fast-casual pizza model is owned by Vic Lanzotti and Chris Hanken. The local businessmen just announced the site for their first Pie’s the Limit location outside Springfield. A store is scheduled to open in Champaign at 2510 Village Green Place at The Crossing in the spring of 2017. * Construction is nearing completion for a NANCY’S PIZZA in Litchfield just off Interstate 55. This will be the third location opened by the locally based franchisee Next Gen, which began in May with a Springfield location at 2301 W. Monroe St. A second Nancy’s Pizza -- providing delivery and carry out only -- opened in O’Fallon, Missouri, recently. The newest location in Litchfield at 13 Thunderbird Circle will be a full-service restaurant with seating for 80 and a beer and wine list, similar to the Springfield site. A late November opening is planned. * DANENBERGER FAMILY VINEYARDS has tickets on sale for a limited-seating, regional pairing dinner Nov. 10. The four-course meal features meats and coffees from BUNN GOURMET, PEASES chocolates and beer and wine from the New Berlin vineyard and ROLLING MEADOWS BREWERY. The menu offers fall spice cured pork belly, espresso-and-sea salt dusted sirloin, rack of lamb and coffee cake with salted caramel ice cream. Wine or beer is served with each course. Cost is $150 a couple. Reservations required. Call 488-6321 extension 203. * The pumpkin may already be carved, but trick-or-treaters can decorate their own Scary Face pumpkin for free on Halloween at IHOP. The classic pancakes come with whipped cream, a strawberry nose and Oreo cookies and candy corn on the side for young diners to complete a signature jack-o-lantern. The special pancakes have been available throughout October, but are free Monday for children 12 and under from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. IHOP is located in Springfield at 2600 Sunrise Drive and 4001 Wabash Ave. * Area restaurants offering Thanksgiving specials will be featured in the Nov. 13 A La Carte column. Businesses interested in participating should submit information by Nov. 9. -- The A La Carte column highlights restaurant openings closings, renovations and relocations, as well as personnel changes and business news.

The incident occurred at the West Kelowna Walmart store and the alleged suspects were caught walking away with the wheelchair by the store's security cameras. The camera video shows shows the first suspect male entering the east entrance of the Walmart in a wheelchair. The male suspect leaves his wheelchair at the east entrance and climbs onto a motorized shopping cart accompanied by a second male suspect. Sometime later both suspects are then observed at the west entrance/exit of the store when the second suspect retrieves the victims wheelchair, assists the first suspect into the victims wheelchair and then pushes the first suspect out of the store's east exit. "In reviewing the video surveillance footage, it appears as though the suspect knowingly left the store in someone else's mobility aid device, while leaving his own behind," said Cpl. Jesse O'Donaghey in a press release. "Of course, there is a possibility that the suspect was confused and mistook the victim's mobility aid device for his own." The investigation is ongoing and police are interested in speaking with the unknown woman, seen wearing the black and white checkered sweater, who awaited the use of the motorized shopping cart left behind by the suspects. Suspect 1 is described as: •    Male, possibly First Nations; •    long dark brown or black hair; •    wearing a plaid jacket, black toque, blue jeans and brown footwear; Suspect 2 is described as: •    Male, possibly First Nations; •    long dark brown or black hair; •    full goatee; •    wearing a tan/beige coloured coat with a hood, a black shirt, light blue jeans and white shoes; Anyone with any information is asked to contact the West Kelowna RCMP at 250-768-2880.

Rich Duprey (TMFCop) Oct 29, 2016 at 1:34PM Any politician praising any company (and its founder) other than Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) would quickly be filed away as a non-story. But because it's Hillary Clinton heaping praise on this company, it's become big news. Hillary Clinton's words may come back to haunt her. Her campaign flagged her speeches lauding Wal-Mart and its founder, Sam Walton, as controversial. Image source: Flickr user Aaron Vowels. Do as I say, not as I do Following one of WikiLeaks' data dumps lifted from Clinton campaign manager John Podesta, an 80-page document from her own campaign emerged, flagging comments Clinton made praising Wal-Mart in speeches the public did not previously know about. The campaign thought it might look bad if those speeches became public. The four-page section that caught their eye and caused consternation dealt with the high regard she had for the company and the esteem she held for its founder, Sam Walton. Because Clinton was both a director and a shareholder in the retailer for six years, her relationship with the country's largest employer has always been fraught with controversy. As a separate WikiLeaks email has since highlighted, Clinton has discussed the need for public and private positions in politics, suggesting why her comments about the retailer might not sit well with potential supporters. Here are the five most important things about Clinton's relationship with Wal-Mart. 1. She was the first woman director at the retailer. Clinton detailed how she came to serve on Wal-Mart's board in the 1980s during a speech to research and investment firm Sanford Bernstein. She warmly recounted how she and Walton had previously worked together on education reform and that Walton approached her, saying, ""[M]y wife and daughter think we need a woman on the board and we can't think of anybody else besides you. I said, well, you have a way with words, Sam. That's really flattering. But, sure, I'll be on the board of Walmart."  She also served on Wal-Mart's board between 1986 and 1992, which was also a period of tremendous growth for the retailer. WMT data by YCharts. 2. She called Sam Walton a "great patriot." In remarks to Sanford Bernstein in May 2013, Clinton extolled Walton's virtues, saying, "Sam Walton was a cheerleader for Wal-Mart but also a great patriot, because he knew that he was able to build this company in this country, and it might not, if ever, have been possible anywhere else." But for some people, Walton's ethics were lacking: he kept wages low; offered few benefits; and was one of the first retailers to heavily import cheap goods from Asia. It could be argued that as Clinton served on the board of directors she supported these initiatives, or at least didn't actively oppose them. For example, activist Ralph Nadar's push for her to support increased wages for women did not elicit a response from the former Senator. 3. She praised Walton for embracing technology early. While many think of Wal-Mart as a stodgy retailer, it's actually a forward-thinking, technologically savvy company that was one of the first large companies to invest heavily in systems we take for granted today. The company was an early adopter of RFID tag technology, universal barcodes as a labeling system, and electronic data interchange -- the transfer of documents electronically -- between the company and its suppliers instead of using paper or fax. In a speech at London Drug Toronto, Clinton said, "They were always thinking about what came next. Yes, they may have started out in small towns and rural areas like Arkansas, but they were always improving their technology." Although many progressives love to hate Wal-Mart, Hillary Clinton considered Sam Walton a visionary and a man who brought positive change to America. Image source: Flickr user Janice Waltzer. But many worry about how those technology advances displace workers. For example, Wal-Mart began experimenting this summer with drones to replace quality control employees while also applying for patents for self-driving shopping carts that can collect themselves, do inventory management, and more. There are 7,000 back-office jobs the retailer announced it also wants to eliminate in favor of "cash recycling" machines and the like. 4. She supported Wal-Mart's burgeoning environmental consciousness. Wal-Mart wields tremendous influence today in the area of sustainability. It diverts from landfills more than 81% of the materials that flow through its stores, clubs, and distribution centers, while the figure runs as high as 90% in Japan and the U.K. It has reduced plastic bag usage by 10 billion bags annually (though mandating paying for plastic bags, as the U.K. did, will have that effect), offers an electronics recycling program, and assists suppliers with sourcing goods responsibly. Clinton credits her efforts at pushing Wal-Mart to consider the environment as a corporate imperative, telling a gathering at the International Leaders Series in Montreal in 2014 that "I think people are starting to get concerned about the environment. And I think we should do a better job in this company in trying to figure out how to have more energy efficient stores, how to deliver goods more efficiently with less use of fossil fuels as possible, and so I chaired the first little environment subcommittee." 5. She praised Wal-Mart for providing jobs, low-cost goods, and expanding the availability of food. To that same London Drug Toronto group, she said people can complain all they want about Wal-Mart, but it's been a good and valuable service for the community. "Those stores -- you know, you don't have to agree with everything Wal-Mart does, I don't -- but those stores served a real purpose, not only for employment and low cost goods, but they did become a way for people who wanted to see what else was available to them could go and look, products that never were readily available in a lot of those places before." Image source: Flickr user Portal Abras. Her base might disagree on the retailer's ability to support community, believing instead that it disrupts it. According the The Intercept, the liberal Economic Policy Institute estimates "Wal-Mart-based trade deficit with China alone eliminated or displaced over 400,000 U.S. jobs between 2001 and 2013." The ties that bind Clinton continues to have close ties with Wal-Mart and the Walton family, and late last year, billionaire heiress Alice Walton contributed more than $353,000 to one of her campaign funds.

In order to get shoppers prepared, they have been releasing a variety of toy lists, toy books, and holiday shopping catalogs. While those catalogs give Americans an idea of what they can expect for this year’s holiday shopping season, everyone really wants to see this year’s Black Friday ads. A few minor retailers have already released their 2016 Black Friday ad scans, but the excitement has been lukewarm. The good news is that Black Friday is on November 25 this year, which is two days earlier than last year, so everything is going to be pushed forward by a few days. While nothing is official, Best Black Friday has predicted the key dates for when you can expect ads to leak from Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Kohl’s, Amazon, and numerous other popular retailers. Disclaimer: The author, Phillip Dengler, is the owner of BestBlackFriday.com, which is referenced in this article. The Inquisitr holds no ownership. Walmart Predicted Ad Leak Date — November 10, 2016 Easily the most popular store on Black Friday, Walmart’s ad release is an event in itself. Walmart had actually kept their ad from leaking in recent years, but a third-party source posted it early on November 11 of last year. Walmart’s security should be a bit better this year, but it should still come out a day earlier on November 10. If you do not already have it, consider downloading Walmart’s shopping app. Like other retailers, they may offer an early sneak peak of their Black Friday deals for app users. As Reuters reports, Walmart is sticking to their minimum order size of $50 in order to qualify for free shipping this holiday season. Wal-Mart focuses on online order pickup in stores, lower prices https://t.co/IYuK4Mqwte — Reuters Business (@ReutersBiz) October 27, 2016 Target Predicted Ad Leak Date – November 8, 2016 While Target is not quite as popular as Walmart, their Black Friday sale is actually one of the best. Per a report from WalletHub last year, Target offered an average discount of 37.3 percent on Black Friday last year, which was a higher percentage than Walmart, Best Buy, and Amazon. Last year’s ad leaked on November 8. In 2014, their ad leaked on November 10. Even though Black Friday is two days earlier this year, Target is likely to stick with the November 8 date. Best Buy Predicted Ad Leak Date – November 9, 2016 Never one for patience, Best Buy’s ad always seems to come out a day before Walmart’s. While this is most likely planned by Walmart, Best Buy could hold out a few days longer in order for Walmart to show their hand first. That is unlikely to happen for 2016, and Best Buy’s ad should leak around November 9. Last year’s ad leaked on November 9, and the 2014 version leaked on November 10. Kohl’s Predicted Ad Leak Date – November 7, 2016 Historically a surprise store on Black Friday, Kohl’s has established itself as a major retailer over the past few years. Their selection of electronics rivals what Walmart and Target offer, and their opportunity to earn “Kohl’s Cash” allows for even bigger net discounts. Out of the major retailers, Kohl’s ad usually comes out first. Their 2015 ad leaked on November 6, which is a Sunday this year. Since major ads usually do not leak on a Sunday, expect their 2016 ad to come out on Monday, November 7. Amazon Predicted Ad Leak Date – November 16, 2016 While Walmart waits until Best Buy releases their ad, Amazon waits until every other store shows their cards. They actually do not release an official Black Friday ad scan, but they do have an annual press release to introduce some of their top items and doorbusters. After this press release comes out, pre-Black Friday deals usually start on their website, and it happens about a week before Thanksgiving. While there are always some solid offers in their early sales, it is in your best interest to wait until Thanksgiving for the real doorbusters. .@Target holiday toy book is available at stores.

Rich Duprey (TMFCop) Oct 29, 2016 at 1:34PM Any politician praising any company (and its founder) other than Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) would quickly be filed away as a non-story. But because it's Hillary Clinton heaping praise on this company, it's become big news. Hillary Clinton's words may come back to haunt her. Her campaign flagged her speeches lauding Wal-Mart and its founder, Sam Walton, as controversial. Image source: Flickr user Aaron Vowels. Do as I say, not as I do Following one of WikiLeaks' data dumps lifted from Clinton campaign manager John Podesta, an 80-page document from her own campaign emerged, flagging comments Clinton made praising Wal-Mart in speeches the public did not previously know about. The campaign thought it might look bad if those speeches became public. The four-page section that caught their eye and caused consternation dealt with the high regard she had for the company and the esteem she held for its founder, Sam Walton. Because Clinton was both a director and a shareholder in the retailer for six years, her relationship with the country's largest employer has always been fraught with controversy. As a separate WikiLeaks email has since highlighted, Clinton has discussed the need for public and private positions in politics, suggesting why her comments about the retailer might not sit well with potential supporters. Here are the five most important things about Clinton's relationship with Wal-Mart. 1. She was the first woman director at the retailer. Clinton detailed how she came to serve on Wal-Mart's board in the 1980s during a speech to research and investment firm Sanford Bernstein. She warmly recounted how she and Walton had previously worked together on education reform and that Walton approached her, saying, ""[M]y wife and daughter think we need a woman on the board and we can't think of anybody else besides you. I said, well, you have a way with words, Sam. That's really flattering. But, sure, I'll be on the board of Walmart."  She also served on Wal-Mart's board between 1986 and 1992, which was also a period of tremendous growth for the retailer. WMT data by YCharts. 2. She called Sam Walton a "great patriot." In remarks to Sanford Bernstein in May 2013, Clinton extolled Walton's virtues, saying, "Sam Walton was a cheerleader for Wal-Mart but also a great patriot, because he knew that he was able to build this company in this country, and it might not, if ever, have been possible anywhere else." But for some people, Walton's ethics were lacking: he kept wages low; offered few benefits; and was one of the first retailers to heavily import cheap goods from Asia. It could be argued that as Clinton served on the board of directors she supported these initiatives, or at least didn't actively oppose them. For example, activist Ralph Nadar's push for her to support increased wages for women did not elicit a response from the former Senator. 3. She praised Walton for embracing technology early. While many think of Wal-Mart as a stodgy retailer, it's actually a forward-thinking, technologically savvy company that was one of the first large companies to invest heavily in systems we take for granted today. The company was an early adopter of RFID tag technology, universal barcodes as a labeling system, and electronic data interchange -- the transfer of documents electronically -- between the company and its suppliers instead of using paper or fax. In a speech at London Drug Toronto, Clinton said, "They were always thinking about what came next. Yes, they may have started out in small towns and rural areas like Arkansas, but they were always improving their technology." Although many progressives love to hate Wal-Mart, Hillary Clinton considered Sam Walton a visionary and a man who brought positive change to America. Image source: Flickr user Janice Waltzer. But many worry about how those technology advances displace workers. For example, Wal-Mart began experimenting this summer with drones to replace quality control employees while also applying for patents for self-driving shopping carts that can collect themselves, do inventory management, and more. There are 7,000 back-office jobs the retailer announced it also wants to eliminate in favor of "cash recycling" machines and the like. 4. She supported Wal-Mart's burgeoning environmental consciousness. Wal-Mart wields tremendous influence today in the area of sustainability. It diverts from landfills more than 81% of the materials that flow through its stores, clubs, and distribution centers, while the figure runs as high as 90% in Japan and the U.K. It has reduced plastic bag usage by 10 billion bags annually (though mandating paying for plastic bags, as the U.K. did, will have that effect), offers an electronics recycling program, and assists suppliers with sourcing goods responsibly. Clinton credits her efforts at pushing Wal-Mart to consider the environment as a corporate imperative, telling a gathering at the International Leaders Series in Montreal in 2014 that "I think people are starting to get concerned about the environment. And I think we should do a better job in this company in trying to figure out how to have more energy efficient stores, how to deliver goods more efficiently with less use of fossil fuels as possible, and so I chaired the first little environment subcommittee." 5. She praised Wal-Mart for providing jobs, low-cost goods, and expanding the availability of food. To that same London Drug Toronto group, she said people can complain all they want about Wal-Mart, but it's been a good and valuable service for the community. "Those stores -- you know, you don't have to agree with everything Wal-Mart does, I don't -- but those stores served a real purpose, not only for employment and low cost goods, but they did become a way for people who wanted to see what else was available to them could go and look, products that never were readily available in a lot of those places before." Image source: Flickr user Portal Abras. Her base might disagree on the retailer's ability to support community, believing instead that it disrupts it. According the The Intercept, the liberal Economic Policy Institute estimates "Wal-Mart-based trade deficit with China alone eliminated or displaced over 400,000 U.S. jobs between 2001 and 2013." The ties that bind Clinton continues to have close ties with Wal-Mart and the Walton family, and late last year, billionaire heiress Alice Walton contributed more than $353,000 to one of her campaign funds. Her tenure on the board showed her exercising her fiduciary responsibility to Wal-Mart's shareholders, not by being a "change agent," which is not necessarily a role for a director, but by prodding and accommodating the management of a major corporate citizen just emerging on the global stage. That might rankle the voters she is trying to court, but she's not necessarily wrong about the benefits Wal-Mart has bestowed.  Rich Duprey has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Our whole store is going to be stocked with new, exciting items from hot toys to new electronics available at the best prices. We will win the season on price, from the first weekend in November to Black Friday and Cyber Monday and through those final weeks in December.” This "win the season" talk should surprise no one since Walmart has used almost exactly that same phrasing for the last few years. They're also probably the only retailer that can credibly make such an audacious claim. Recommended: Are you a smart shopper? Take our quiz. That's not to say that other major players like Target and Best Buy won't be competitive, but let's face it – just about everyone is following Walmart's lead. Test your knowledge Are you a smart shopper? Take our quiz. Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/14 So what are their plans exactly? Digging into  this morning's announcement, we found it light on actual details. Here's what we know: You can get a 32-inch Roku HDTV for $125 throughout November and December. That also happens to be its Black Friday price from last year. We're going to speculate it might be marked down even further for Black Friday 2016. They cited "thousands of new rollbacks" but didn't call out anything specific other than the Roku TV. Walmart is expanding in-store pickup to include more items. They'll also have staff dedicated to managing in-store pickup throughout the holiday season. They're hiring Holiday Helpers – employees in yellow vests and elf hats – who can do things like point you to the shortest line or run and grab something you forgot while you stay in line. They might also give you a candy cane. They also called out a Walmart-exclusive  24V Disney Princess Carriage Ride-On, but with a price tag of $398 it's hard to call it a deal unless it gets the Black Friday rollback treatment. And that's about it. There's a cheap TV, vague pronouncements about more rollbacks, you'll have better luck with in-store pickup, and an elf might give you a candy cane. We expect to see more details from Walmart in November, and we expect to see the  Walmart Black Friday ad closer to November 10-11.

Photo By David Carson, dcarson@post-dispatch.com ”And all around me, a voice was sounding This land was made for you and me.” — Woody Guthrie Mark Makowski was raised in Florissant. He graduated from North County Tech in 1976 and quickly got a job as an auto mechanic. Friends introduced him to Pam Williams, also a Florissant native. They were married in 1979. They bought a home in St. Charles County. Their first child, Russell, was born in 1983. Their second child, Matt, was born in 1990. By that time, Makowski was working on the assembly line at the Chrysler plant in Fenton, a job he had gotten through a brother-in-law. In 1999, the family moved to Union. Russell went to Union High School. He did fine, but he wasn’t really interested in academics. He took technical classes. He was most interested in carpentry. He graduated in 2002 and got a job at a Walmart. Pam was also working there. So the family represented the two sides of blue-collar America — the United Automobile Workers and Walmart. Russell left Walmart to take a job with an aviation company in St. Louis County. He was hoping to use his carpentry skills to refurbish the interiors of private jets, but that never materialized. He mostly did cleanup work. +1  Russell Makowski He joined the Army in November 2004, and left for basic training the day before Thanksgiving. He did his basic training at Fort Sill in Oklahoma, the only active Army installation built on the Southern Plains during the Indian wars. He then did artillery training at Fort Sill. In December 2005, he was sent to Iraq. He came home for a two-week leave in August and went back to Iraq. He was killed on Sept. 14, 2006, when an improvised bomb went off while he was on foot patrol in Taji just north of Baghdad. Back in Union, the doorbell rang and the world changed. But the world did not, does not, stop. In 2009, the Chrysler plant shut down. Mark Makowski was 52. That is a tough age to be looking for work. Also, in a time when unions are under attack, there might have been some animosity toward UAW workers. They had it too good, some employers might have thought. And they did have it pretty good. One of the nice things was this — if you were over 50, you could take retirement. Mark did. About a year later, Pam quit her job at Walmart. They were both too young for Social Security, and the UAW retirement wasn’t a whole lot, but their expenses were low. So, according to Makowski, it was the desire to do something rather than a desperate need for money that led him to look for work. He found a part-time job in 2010 as custodian at Union High School, the school from which both his sons had graduated. He became a full-time worker in 2013. He worked from 3 in the afternoon until about 11:30. His area of responsibility included four classrooms, a greenhouse, the library, a hallway and two bathrooms. He was fired last month. In a legal sense, the reason for the firing seems clear. Makowski took a week off beginning Sept. 12. School district policy requires an employee to obtain permission before taking time off. An employee is required to make the request at least two days prior to the proposed time off. Makowski made his request in time — the Wednesday before the Monday of the week he was taking off — but he did not hear back. In other words, he did not get approval. He told me didn’t always get approval in the past. He described a situation in which no denial meant tacit approval. It all seemed rather odd. Would an employer fire a good employee over something that sounded like a misunderstanding? Makowski showed me the letter of termination he received Sept. 22. It cites several board policies. Most had to do with vacations and prior approval. But there was also mention of maintaining courteous relationships with other employees and transmitting constructive criticism to the appropriate administrator. I asked Makowski if he had an attitude problem. He said he asked a lot of questions, often to the district superintendent whose office is in the high school. Questions about working conditions and pay. For instance, sometimes a day that was supposed to be a holiday was turned into a school day because it was used to cancel out a snow day. As hourly rather than salaried workers, shouldn’t the custodians be entitled to double-time? After all, they were working on a paid day off. A good question, I’d say, but one that a union steward might ask. The custodians do not have a union. I called the district superintendent, Steve Weinhold. He said he couldn’t discuss specifics of personnel matters. “I can say that when people break policies people are sometimes removed of their duties whether they are teachers, custodians or superintendents.” Certainly. Truth is, though, Makowski does not regret what he did. He was going to take that week off no matter what. That Wednesday was the 10th anniversary of Russell’s death.

Rob Davis has some timely tips for trick or treaters. Then, he answers readers traffic questions in this week's Ask a Trooper column. He got a little help from Russ Henckel, Wyoming public works traffic engineer, about a tricky traffic situation near the Walmart store on 54th Street SW. Have a traffic question? Email Davis and the troopers at the Lakeview and Rockford posts at AskTpr@michigan.gov. Here's Lt. Rob Davis: We've had a number of serious car vs. pedestrian accidents in the Grand Rapids area in recent weeks. With Halloween fast approaching, I thought it a good chance to go over some basic safety tips and explain why we as parents we need to be especially vigilant. According to AAA, Halloween is the deadliest night of the year for pedestrians. On average, children are more than twice as likely to be hit by a car and killed on Halloween than any other day of the year! (Safe Kids Worldwide). Lt. Rob DavisMichigan State Police  For motorists who are out and about during the trick-or-treating hours, please slow down, watch for children darting between parked cars, yards and driveways, and exit driveways with extra caution. If you're driving your children between neighborhood and developments, make sure they exit on the non-street side and use available sidewalks. Below are some safety tips for our trick-or-treaters and their parents. For our older kids who have phones, don't text while walking, you may inadvertently walk in front of car. And always remember just because you see the car doesn't mean they see you! Trick-or-treat safety tips: • Children of any age should be accompanied by an adult. • Walk! Never run. • Use sidewalks when possible. • Cross the street only at corners or crosswalks and obey traffic signals. • Look left, right, and left again before crossing streets. • Do not cross the street between parked cars. • Carry a flashlight. • Wear light-colored or reflective-type clothing so you are more visible. • Accept treats at the door and never go into a stranger's house. • Stay in familiar neighborhoods. Plan your route and share it with your family. • Stay in a group. • Only visit homes that have the porch light on. • Stay in populated and well-lit areas. Do not cut through back alleys or fields. • Make sure all costumes are flame retardant. Avoid walking too close to open fires, candles and jack-o-lanterns. • Make sure an adult inspects all candy before eating it. Do not eat candy that is already opened. • Be sure to follow community curfew rules. Halloween is a fun and exciting time for our kids and keeping them safe with some basic precautions will ensure an enjoyable and memorable experience. Thanks and stay safe. Jim: There's a Walmart on 54th St in Wyoming, MI, whose exit drive has me perplexed. When exiting from the far west exit of the parking lot, there is a traffic light immediately west of the drive. The westbound traffic on 54th street has a stop line before the exit drive. Can traffic exiting the parking lot go through the red light (making a right-on-red) or do they need to stop for the light? To complicate this, there's a second stop line almost underneath the actual light! (I'm not sure if that stop line is for the subsequent railroad tracks or not.) Thanks for offering a great way for all of us to be educated about safe driving!! This is the stretch of 54th Street SW referenced by reader.Google Maps  Russ Henckel, Wyoming public works traffic engineer, answered this question at Rob's request. Russ: Thanks for reaching out regarding this "unique" traffic situation along 54th St in front of Walmart. The area is a busy corridor with several signals impacting the flow of traffic. The westerly Walmart exit right-turn-only drive is not ideal but functions. The Walmart drive outlets at the signal that is the pre-signal for the RR immediately west of Walmart. The pre-signal is required because the Clay Avenue signal further west (by about 500 feet) would have traffic stacking through the RR tracks several times a day due to the amount of 54th St traffic if the pre-signal did not exist. So to prevent people from stacking at the Clay Ave signal through the RR tracks, the pre-signal will stop traffic slightly before the Clay Avenue signal cycles to red. Once the pre-signal cycles to red traffic on 54th Street is supposed to stop at the stop bar just prior to the RR track. In order to assist a small number of vehicles exiting Walmart, another stop bar was added just prior to the exit drive opening. Then when the pre-signal cycles to red a couple of vehicles could pull out of Walmart and should stop at the stop bar prior to the RR track. But, as long as a train is not approaching, vehicles could cross the track and go up to the Clay Ave signal and stop there. The pre-signal is only there to prevent vehicles from stacking to a point where cars end up stopping on the RR track. I believe legally the vehicles should stop at the stop bar prior to crossing the track but Police would be the official answer to that. Either way the intent of the pre-signal is met as long as cars don't park on the RR track. I hope that helps understand how the signals function in the area. Here's another view of 54th Street SW in Wyoming.Google Maps  William: I just have one quick question regarding traffic laws: Has the law changed regarding turning left onto a two way street on a red light when no oncoming traffic is present? Three times in three days now I've witnessed separate drivers who were stopped at a red light suddenly turn left onto a 2 way street. The first was Saturday at about 10:30 AM. We were behind a red SUV who was stopped for the red light in the left turn lane at the corner of Division Ave and Lakewood. The car was facing South and turned East onto Lakewood and the light was about ½ the way through being red. That same evening we were on E 7th Street here in Holland going straight so we could turn on to River Avenue eventually. We were at the light on E. 7th and I believe Columbia when a small car with a very loud muffler pull up on my left, came to a complete stop at the light and then turned left going south on Columbia (Not sure about this street) which was a two way street... . The third case was at a very busy intersection and there was traffic. The car was headed northbound on River in Holland at the corner of Douglas. There are two left turn lanes but the light was red and we were stopped. The light was real red. A black pickup truck all of a sudden punched it and turned left. No accident occurred but had there been it would have been ugly. Thank you and all your team for everything you do for the people of Michigan. You've got a tough job but each of you do a magnificent job and we appreciate you. Rob: The law has not changed, so "no" you cannot make a left turn on red onto a two way roadway. You can however, turn left on red from a two lane roadway onto a one-way roadway, unless of course it's otherwise posted. Here is the language in case you want to refer to it in the future 257.612: Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal, after stopping before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or at a limit line when marked or, if there is no crosswalk or limit line, before entering the intersection, may make a right turn from a 1-way or 2-way street into a 2-way street or into a 1-way street carrying traffic in the direction of the right turn or may make a left turn from a 1-way or 2-way street into a 1-way roadway carrying traffic in the direction of the left turn, unless prohibited by sign, signal, marking, light, or other traffic control device. The vehicular traffic shall yield the right of way to pedestrians and bicyclists lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. Thank-you for your kind words of support and drive safe. Paul: Under what circumstances might a vehicle have a succession of temporary plates over six months or longer? A black BMW in our parking lot on Willow Lake Drive in Kalamazoo has Michigan plate with an orange Dec expiration sticker. This spring it had a paper plate in the back window showing a 6/2016 expiration. That changed to a temporary plate showing a 9/2016 expiration. Now, it has changed to one showing an 11/20/16 expiration. I am curious as to what might be the circumstances surrounding this. Rob: To my knowledge there is no limit on the number of temporary registration permits you can buy for a vehicle. To give an example, those in the military will buy them off and on based upon when they're in the country. There certainly is no financial incentive to doing this, as it can cost as much as $30 for one month. If you believe there is something suspicious about the vehicle please contact local law enforcement.

These three retailers have been heeding that call for years. Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Oct 29, 2016 at 9:08AM Source: HillaryClinton.com The presidential campaign is finally entering its home stretch, and in less than two weeks we'll know who our next president will be. While the outcome isn't certain, most polls show Hillary Clinton leading the race, making it most likely that she will be president come January.  Clinton has called for raising the minimum wage to a living wage, and has promised to work to lift base hourly pay to $15/hour over time. She has also said she would encourage companies to invest in workers by rewarding companies that share profits and make investments in their employees. Raising the minimum wage has long been controversial among businesses and political interests, who claim that such a policy would actually force layoffs by incentivizing automation and raising prices on customers. While the consequences of such a policy are debatable, there are several companies that have found success by paying above-average wages and investing in their employees. Here are three of them. 1. Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) Best known for its rock-bottom prices on bulk goods, Costco also pays its employees surprisingly high wages.  Earlier this year, the warehouse retailer said it would bump up its base pay rate by $1.50 to $13-$13.50/hour. The average Costco worker now earns more than $20/hour, much better than last year's median wage of $10.47/hour. Costco has long had an employee-friendly compensation policy, as it believes that reducing turnover and keeping employees within its ranks saves money in training and hiring costs over the long run. The high wages also mean the company avoids much of the bad press that has sullied rivals like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT)  over the years. Wal-Mart's employees have demanded higher wages, and interest groups have assailed it for poor labor practices. Costco's business model enables it to pay higher wages than Wal-Mart because its revenue per employee is nearly three times as high as Wal-Mart's, meaning wages are a lower percentage of its costs. Wal-Mart, however, seems to be borrowing from Costco's strategy, as it's noticed an improvement in store performance and customer satisfaction since it lifted wages to $10/hour. 2. Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) Like Costco Co-Founder and former CEO Jim Sinegal, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz has often led with an employee-first mindset. Schultz has taken steps to provide unique benefits for frontline employees, including offering tuition reimbursement for all full-time and part-time benefits-eligible employees who wish to pursue their BAs online through Arizona State University.  Employees are also eligible for stock grants after one year of employment with the company. Starbucks offers new hires restricted units it calls bean stock, with employees becoming eligible to receive 50% of shares after their first year and the remaining after the second. Introduced in 1991, it was the first such program of its kind in retail. The coffee giant has also been consistently ahead of the curve in providing healthcare coverage to its employees. Even before the Affordable Care Act, it offered insurance to part-time employees, a rare benefit in the restaurant industry, and today the company covers about 70% of premium costs and 100% of preventative care costs. 3. Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) Founder Danny Meyer refers to his booming burger chain as not fast food or even fast casual, but as fine casual. That attitude seems to be reflected in the way the company treats its employees. Shake Shack has a policy of paying workers a premium above the minimum wage, and according to Glassdoor, it pays more than $2.50 above the prevailing fast-food wage. Meyer and his company see that as the price for attracting and retaining a higher-quality workforce. As Costco has found, doing so reduces turnover and helps the burger chain fill managerial roles as the company expands.   As far as benefits, Shake Shack also offers a 401(k) matching program, comprehensive healthcare after 90 days, and a monthly bonus program based on store sales and other metrics. CEO Randy Garutti summed up the company's employment philosophy, telling The New York Times, "The No. 1 reason we pay our team well above the minimum wage is we believe that if we take care, they will take care of our customers." Notably, all three of these companies have outperformed their peers by wide margins. Shake Shack and Starbucks continue to thrive at a time when many fast-food chains are suffering from the so-called restaurant recession, and Costco has been one of the few mass-merchandise retailers that has been able to consistently grow despite the threat of Amazon and e-commerce. As Hillary Clinton hopes, perhaps more companies will soon take notice that such policies can reward employees and investors.  Jeremy Bowman owns shares of Shake Shack and Starbucks.

Summerland resident Bob Mair left his wheelchair near the store's entrance on Wednesday, opting to use one of Walmart's complimentary motorized scooters while he did his shopping. When he left the store, his wheelchair was gone. "People that steal from a disabled person are really just scoundrels," he said. Fortunately, the theft was caught on surveillance video. Walmart has cameras in the entrance, and police have obtained the footage. Video shows a person being wheeled out on the chair by another, but the best look at the pair is from a video shot earlier. That footage shows them entering the store through another door in a less expensive chair, suggesting they may have made an upgrade. Fellow shoppers were horrified that someone made off with the chair. "It's amazing that people have the nerve to do something like that... It's sad," one person said. "Too many crooks around," another added. Mair has had to use an old, beat-up chair since the theft, and is having a hard time getting around. His neighbours said the theft was the last thing he needed, and that the senior has been struggling. The senior is hopeful his workers' compensation may replace the chair, but was shocked that the thieves had taken "advantage of someone that is somewhat defenseless." He said the stolen chair was "probably the top of the line" in Canada. RCMP said the wheelchair is a custom Helio A7, and is worth more than $3,000. It has been described as all black, with polymer-type rims and an upgraded seat cushion. Its footrests have been removed, and the brand name "Motion Composites" is printed on the backrest.  "We urge the person who took the chair to drop it off at any RCMP detachment or simply return it to the store," Cpl. Jesse O'Donaghey said in a statement. "RCMP would like to quickly reunite the victim of this senseless crime with his much needed mobility device." Anyone with more information is asked to contact officers at 250-768-2880, or call Crime Stoppers anonymously at 1-800-222-8477 (TIPS). With a report from CTV Vancouver's Kent Molgat Photos The thieves were caught on camera leaving the West Kelowna store with the wheelchair. Summerland resident Bob Mair left his wheelchair near the store's entrance. When he returned, the chair was gone.

(Spoiler: Yes) Posted By Vince Grzegorek vgrzegorek@clevescene.com> on Wed, Oct 19, 2016 at 12:55 PM Last September we bestowed the Steelyard Walmart with the title of Worst Walmart in America. It was not a decision made lightly. Nor was it a close call. All manner of incompetence lives in the building (and parking lot, for that matter). The vortex of suck is so strong at 3400 Steelyard Dr. as to threaten to disrupt entire weather systems. The disregard for common human decency so total it inspires fear. The feedback so one-sided one wonders how no one has noticed or rectified the situation. Then again, given that employees and managers at the store are either nonexistent or on their phones, it's not entirely surprising. But we held out hope for improvement. We thought maybe, just maybe, that our missive would reach receptive ears at Walmart headquarters. That our little award might filter its way to Top Men at the superstore. That someone in charge might say to themselves, "Holy shit, this is bad. Let's fix this." We should have known better. One year later, it appears as though nothing has changed and no one cares. We can't vouch for that ourselves, since we haven't stepped foot in that particular brand of hell since last year. But evidence continues to pile up. It is irrefutable. There are concerns, and there are many. There is woeful resignation. There are pleas for help. There are endless examples. Here are just a few from the last calendar year.

Published Oct 30th, 2016 12:52 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Looking for ways to speed up and automate the pickup of online non-food orders (general merchandise), Walmart U.S. is testing a giant device that’s a cross between a huge Coke machine and bank ATM at Store No. 1 on West Walnut Street in Rogers. The machine sits inside the store’s front door on the side of general merchandise. The bright orange collection device ascends into the store’s ceiling and has a television monitor on its front side. The machine is physically connected to the store’s back room inventory. There is a kiosk positioned next the automated pickup machine where shoppers sign in by typing their last name. Shoppers are prompted to verify their order then an order number in receipt form is dispensed from the kiosk. The shopper scans the order receipt into the reader on the large automated pickup machine. The order will then be dispensed from the machine much like a can of soda. The process should soon be fully automated, but the machine now requires a Walmart employee to help a customer with the process, according to a store employee. This is a first test round of machine-dispensed orders by the retail giant. The test follows lockers that were in some stores. Walmart U.S. executives have said the retailer is trying to make pickup of general merchandise orders more convenient. The retailer had previously located the pickup desk at the back of the store near the electronics department. Staffing that pickup counter was complicated as there was no check-in required on the part of the shopper. Long wait times at the pickup desk have been a common complaint among users. Walmart unveiled in June its pickup kiosk and waiting area at the front of the supercenter on Pleasant Grove Road in Rogers. At that time Walmart executives demonstrated the kiosk sign-in process by logging in their last name. But the plan at that time was to have the customer sit in a small waiting area until an employee brought their order up from the back of the store. The newest online pickup test by Walmart U.S. sits inside the retailer’s supercenter on West Walnut Road in Rogers, Ark. However, Walmart U.S. CEO Greg Foran wants to see more employees out in the store helping customers. The retailer hopes automation and consolidating more services is a way to best manage employee numbers and also provide more customer convenience. The newest version of “Walmart Pickup” could be virtually automated if the customer feedback is positive. “Our free Pickup service is a popular way for people to save time and money. We know speed and convenience are important to our customers and we’re always looking for new ways to bring it to them. We are excited to be one of the first companies to test this new technology and are looking forward to hearing feedback from our customers and associates,” said corporate spokesman Kory Lundberg. Walmart said millions of items are shipped to its stores for pickup each week and the retailer is continually seeking to make the process more convenient. The retail giant said the use of lockers and pickup waiting area in the front of store are all part of ongoing tests from which it will gather customer feedback.

The county has been without a full-service grocery since 2008. Greg Kocher gkocher1@herald-leader.com i By Greg Kocher gkocher1@herald-leader.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Garrard County has been without a full-service grocery for eight years, but that’s about to change. Larry Thornberry, who has a Save-A-Lot store in Richmond, confirmed Saturday that he plans to build a new store in Lancaster. Groundbreaking will be Nov. 21 on a lot on U.S. 27 across from McDonald’s. The 15,000-square-foot store will open in June or July 2017, Thornberry said. Lancaster hasn’t had a full-service grocery since Lynco closed in 2008. The city does have Dollar General and Family Dollar stores and several convenience stores, and while they offer many items found in a grocery, they don’t sell fresh produce or have a butcher department. Many Garrard residents drive a short distance to a Wal-Mart Supercenter in Stanford, in Lincoln County south of Lancaster. There’s another Wal-Mart in Danville, 12 miles to the west. Those two stores have a nearly 72 percent share of the Garrard County retail market, according to a 2014 study conducted by Associated Wholesale Grocers, a retailer-owned cooperative. Thornberry said he wasn’t intimidated by the larger stores.   “We’ve been in Richmond since 1939, and we’ve been next to Wal-Mart and we’ve been next to Kroger, and we’ve survived,” Thornberry said. “Save-A-Lot has a good program, and we can compete with the big boys to a certain extent.” Elected officials have long held that Lancaster could support a store, and they pointed to the 2014 study that estimated weekly sales for a store. “To have a full-service grocery store right in town is something that we need,” Garrard County Judge-Executive John Wilson said. “We’re glad to have them.” Greg Kocher: 859-231-3305, @HLpublicsafety Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story State Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 0:43 A wildfire burns near Pineville Pause 1:05 The dream of an Appalachian Wildlife Center 1:21 Georgetown's first Pride Festival brings community together 0:31 What if your bathtub water looked like this? 2:39 Families of drug addicts sharing 'horrific experience' to raise awareness 1:28 Friend remembers Mark Sawaf as 'real fun person' 1:34 Will high-speed internet save Eastern Kentucky? 1:07 Andy Beshear on UK's lawsuit against student newspaper 2:15 Chalk artist recreates 151 Pokémon on EKU's campus 2:17 Mother Teresa's legacy: Eastern Kentucky convent carries on her work 1:41 Mother Teresa's 1982 visit to Eastern Kentucky Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 4 days ago Drone video of forest fire in Jackson 4:26 4 days ago Drone video of forest fire in Jackson 0:43 11 days ago A wildfire burns near Pineville 1:05 13 days ago The dream of an Appalachian Wildlife Center View more video State Owen County to lose major plant, 411 jobs, officials say Wildfires close road and part of national forest in Red River Gorge Men in Laurel County arrested after 15 pounds of marijuana found in trunk Comer sworn in as Kentucky's newest congressman House swears in 3 new members, more coming soon Editor's Choice Videos Subscriptions Paper Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Digital Replica Edition Delivery Vacation Stop Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us Social, Mobile & More Facebook Twitter YouTube Google+ Mobile Options Advertising Contact Us Place a Classified Ad Local Shopping / Coupons Special Publications Digital Solutions Media Kit Copyright Privacy Policy Terms of Service Subscriptions Paper Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Digital Replica Edition Delivery Vacation Stop Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us Social, Mobile & More Facebook Twitter YouTube Google+ Mobile Options Advertising Contact Us Place a Classified Ad Local Shopping / Coupons Special Publications Digital Solutions Media Kit More Copyright Privacy Policy Terms of Service

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Martin Weil and Clarence Williams October 29 Follow @martyweilwapost A person was shoved into the trunk of a car Friday night in front of a Walmart store in Northern Virginia and then driven away in a possible abduction, Prince William County police said. The incident occurred in front of the store on Worth Avenue in the Woodbridge area about 10 p.m., police said. Surveillance video showed two men getting out of a dark, shiny four-door sedan in front of the store. One goes to open the trunk. Then the two men are seen again, moving toward the car, the apparent victim between them. As they grab, pull and push him toward the car, he lurches backward for a moment, in an apparent effort to get away. But they renew their grip and wrestle him into the trunk headfirst. They close the trunk, get into the car and drive away. Police said additional surveillance video, taken earlier, showed the car driving alongside the victim. The victim appeared at the time to be speaking with the driver. In addition, witnesses said the victim and his apparent abductors had possibly been “play-fighting” before the incident. Descriptions of the possible abductors, provided by police, appeared sketchy. No motive in the incident could be learned, nor was information available about the people in the surveillance video. local Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

It has also forced digital pioneers such as Amazon to set up a physical space for their customers – proving yet again that as customers evolve, so must retailers. For both customers and retailers, this is a time of discovery and disruption. Retailers need to rethink their business model, especially with a growing generation of digital native customers, pressures to enhance efficiency and processes, and the need to find new sources of revenue. Understanding the new reality of retail in the GCC After a period of rapid growth for years, with the region successfully positioned as a leading international retail destination, there has been some expected slowing of momentum recently. According to Kantar Retail, the Middle East retail market is expected to grow at 7.7 per cent CAGR between 2015 and 2020, down from 9.8 per cent CAGR between 2010 and 2015. Keeping this in mind, the GCC retail sector needs to think through its digital strategy, assess short- and long-term opportunities, prioritize, prepare for challenges and regulations, and tailor plans to region-specific demands.  The GCC population is remarkable in the fact that a large percentage of the population is under the age of 25, making it even more imperative for retailers to have a strategy in place to cater to a generation of digital natives. According to Alpen Capital, the GCC population is projected to reach close to 60 million in 2020, of which, the number of people below 25 years of age is likely to surpass 22 million.1 But before we think digital, it is important to also understand the changing role of brick and mortar. Today, instead of just a store to grow sales, the physical space is an experience zone for customers, to establish long-term relationships and turn customers into brand loyalists. A case in point is the Apple Store in the Mall of the Emirates, which allows an immersive experience where customers browse, lounge and leave with hopefully a better understanding of the technology that the brand offers instead of feeling pressured to buy a product. So the retail space has evolved into a marketing tool, demand generator, and brand differentiator2. Getting phygital This shifting role applies across all touch points in the customer cycle – be it pre and post sales, and more and more seamlessly across physical and digital sales platforms, or what are collectively becoming known as phygital platforms. This is where digitization can play a crucial role to enhance the customer experience and where associated advanced data analytics can draw beneficial marketing and service insights from the massive amounts of customer data being generated. All of this can then be used to provide a 360-degree personalized view of the customer for advancing more intelligent and enhanced customer experiences, and for also identifying new customer bases with similar interests. Aggregated data provides insights into customer behavior and preferences, thereby enabling more targeted marketing options for retailers. Innovation in the retail space through digital strategies can be lateral or vertical. Lateral involves leveraging existing product lines that can be made into regular or repetitive revenue streams, such as groceries packaging and delivery. Vertical innovation is through offering new product lines that didn’t exist before, based on analyzing customer behavior data, both online and in-store, such as customized 3-D printed objects. Customers are ultimately best placed to benefit from digitization. Besides being offered a variety of options so far unavailable, all at the click of a button, they are also being empowered to make the right choice with easily accessible knowledge and the support of a community of informed peers on social media – a collective digitally-enabled market-backed selection process. Facing fears As digital strategies change the sector, it is important for retailers to prepare for some of the expected challenges. For example, today automation allows for the tracking of products through the delivery process: from manufacturing to shipping and delivery. Automation enables process efficiencies and optimization, and eliminates redundancies. This will lead to a redistribution of jobs, and some traditional functions will need to be repurposed. There is an understandable fear that digitization and automation may threaten jobs. Smart change management is key towards addressing this fear, to gain large-scale support for digitization in the retail sector. It is important to understand that instead of creating redundancies, digitization and automation enable a redistribution of functions and the acquisition or preferably development of new skills as the job roles become more sophisticated. Security is another challenge. It is important to understand that maintaining security is a continuous process. Cybersecurity is a shifting target and includes comprehensive phygital security planning, as the physical and digital enablers tend to increasingly overlap, for example smart HVAC or security systems in malls and their interdependent technology platforms. Another concern is maintaining data privacy. One solution is to anonymize information by stripping off personal details, so that insights from the customer data can be utilized while addressing privacy concerns. Regionally, governments have also sought to drive a number of recent regulations towards enabling greater understanding and inviting more participation among governments and citizens when it comes to data exchange. For example, the Dubai Data Law introduced in 2016, requires both individuals and organizations – public and private – to make their data available, in an anonymous manner, either for free or in exchange for data from other providers. The aim of such initiatives is to have a broad base of customer acceptance so that retailers are able to utilize anonymous data to enhance the customer experience. What’s next? Robotics is a field of much interest and has already started impacting the retail sector. From manufacturing to logistics, the unmanned world will become the norm in the not-so-distant future. Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are helping to improve customer experience and are here to stay, a case in point being Marks & Spencer’s Middle East stores, which have launched the Virtual Closet, using augmented reality for customers to try on outfits and accessories. 3D printing is also revolutionizing the retail sector – with industry analysts Gartner predicting at least seven of the top 10 retailers in the world using 3D printing. Spend on 3D printing in MEA is expected to increase from $0.47 billion in 2015 to $1.3 billion by 2019, according to IDC. Regional governments are also preparing for the increasing role of this technology across sectors. For example, the world’s first 3D printed office building opened in Dubai recently, and the Dubai 3D Printing Strategy aims to make the city a global 3D hub by 2030. Higher integration of Machine to Machine (M2M) technology in retail is also expected to enhance the customer experience, whether through m-payment trends or location-based targeted marketing. The connected world is becoming a goldmine of new ideas that can bring benefits to both customers and retailers. Change is always disruptive and digitization in retail will be no exception. What is important is to not rush into it in panic, but instead to systematically plan for how it will drive enhanced customer experience, operational efficiency, transparency, profitability, and new revenue models.

FRONT PAGE FLORIDA OCEAN SPACE CRIME POLITICS WEATHER Saturday, October 29, 2016 Walmart To Start 2016 Black Friday Deals Early Walmart announced plans to launch holiday shopping deals and sales during the entire months of November and December in 2016. Like many other retailers, Walmart is not waiting until Black Friday to offer substantial holiday discounts this year. To kick off the season, the retail giant has launched thousands of new rollbacks combined with tens of thousands of items available at low prices every day. For example, Walmart will offer a new Roku 32-inch HDTV for $125 in November and December, which is the same price as the retailer’s Black Friday offer last year. “I can’t remember another year when I’ve been this excited about the merchandise we are offering customers,” said Steve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer, Walmart U.S. “It’s not just about one category or one item. Our whole store is going to be stocked with new, exciting items from hot toys to new electronics available at the best prices. We will win the season on price, from the first weekend in November to Black Friday and Cyber Monday and through those final weeks in December.” From an exclusive Disney Princess Carriage and a 3D Virtual Reality Drone to ugly Christmas sweaters, Walmart is stocking its shelves with the items it believes customers will be looking for this holiday season. Walmart To Reduce Line Wait Times With Pickup Service, Holiday Helpers For the first time, Walmart is deploying an army of 'Holiday Helpers' to better serve customers in the checkout line.  The retailer has also dramatically increased the amount of products available through its Pickup service, launched thousands of rollbacks along with other great prices available every day, and will add millions of items to Walmart.com in the coming months. “We are listening to our customers and looking for ways to simplify their busy lives,” said Judith McKenna, chief operating officer, Walmart U.S. “Whether our customers are checking items off their grocery lists or their kids’ holiday lists, we want to make their shopping experiences easy and fun. This includes having clean, fast and friendly stores, an easier check out experience and enabling customers to shop seamlessly through services like Pickup.” Walmart Expands Online Holiday Shopping Inventory Walmart has substantially grown its online assortment from roughly 8 million at the start of this year to 20 million today with millions of additional items scheduled to be added in the coming months. The retailer is also making its broader assortment easier to shop. Starting Nov. 1, Walmart.com will feature a top 20 list of items to help customers discover exclusive offerings, great prices and products they wouldn’t expect to find at Walmart.

Here are two that aren't good ideas and one that is. Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Oct 29, 2016 at 8:45AM Image source: Getty Images. With the unrelenting rise of e-commerce putting an increasing amount of pressure on traditional retailers, there are plenty of retail stocks that are best avoided. Some are obvious: Sears is a trainwreck no matter how you slice it. There are some retail stocks that appear to be solid investments on the surface but ultimately come with major downsides. Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and GameStop (NYSE:GME) are two prime examples. On the flip side, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) doesn't get the credit it deserves. The company may be the quintessential brick-and-mortar retailer, but it's been making some aggressive moves to better compete in a world where e-commerce can no longer be ignored. Why you should avoid Costco stock Costco is a great company, but even the best company bought at too high of a price can make for a lousy investment. The numbers speak for themselves: Costco earned $5.33 per share in fiscal 2016, putting the price-to-earnings ratio at a stratospheric 28. Growth is consistent but slow, with analysts expecting mid-single-digit revenue growth this year and next. Image source: Costco. Costco stock certainly deserves a premium based on the quality of the company, but I think we've reached the point where that premium is excessive. This doesn't mean that the stock price is going to collapse, but I suspect that returns from here will be depressed. Costco stock soared 81% over the past five years. Given the current valuation, I suspect that the next five years won't be nearly as impressive. Beyond valuation, Costco has been extremely slow to embrace e-commerce. This hasn't been much of a problem thus far, as the warehouse club model protects the company to a degree from online retailers. But Costco is going to eventually need to embrace e-commerce and make it work with its fleet of stores. Combine this long-term uncertainty around e-commerce with an inflated valuation and you get a retail stock that doesn't look like a great investment. Why you should avoid GameStop stock GameStop stock looks incredible cheap, trading for a single-digit multiple of earnings. The company has been diversifying beyond selling physical games, opening and acquiring stores that sell used electronics and mobile devices and increasing its focus on selling digital games. Diversification is a fine strategy, and it's the right move for the company. But there's a time bomb built into GameStop's business model that makes it a stock to avoid. Image source: GameStop. GameStop makes a killing from buying and selling used games. In fiscal 2015, pre-owned video game products accounted for 38% of the company's gross profit and carried a gross margin of nearly 47%, nearly twice the gross margin of new video game products. Used games are a cash cow for the company. Unfortunately for GameStop, the age of physical disks will eventually come to an end when game consoles inevitably go all digital. When that happens, the new game business will disappear, and the used-game business, while likely lingering due to previous-generation games, will quickly become far less lucrative for the company. GameStop is going to look a lot different 10 years from now, or even five years from now, compared to today. A bargain valuation doesn't mean much if the main drivers of earnings are likely to disappear. It's impossible to predict how profitable the GameStop of the future will be, and that's a good reason to sit this one out. Why Wal-Mart is a stock to buy Wal-Mart's earnings are currently depressed thanks to the company's various initiatives, including wage hikes, increased employee training, and e-commerce. Wal-Mart expects to produce adjusted earnings per share between $4.15 and $4.35 in both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018, down from $4.59 in fiscal 2016. Image source: Wal-Mart. The investments that Wal-Mart is making, though, are important. First, the company is trying to improve the customer experience in its stores, raising wages, bringing back greeters, and making it easier for employees to climb the ladder into management positions. The results so far have been encouraging, with U.S. comparable sales consistently growing and customer satisfaction on the rise. On the e-commerce front, Wal-Mart is going big. The company recently acquired Jet.com for over $3 billion, giving it a brand that could help the company appeal to younger customers. Online grocery pickup is a major initiative, allowing customers to order groceries online and have them carried out to their car for no extra charge. And ShippingPass, the $49 annual membership that provides free two-day shipping, is an effort to compete head-on with Amazon Prime. Retailers that fail to adapt to changing consumer preferences are going to be left behind. Wal-Mart is taking aggressive steps to ensure that it can continue to thrive in a world where e-commerce is becoming increasingly important. With the stock trading for around 16 times earnings guidance, Wal-Mart looks like a solid long-term investment. Timothy Green has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Police said a deputy noticed a suspicious vehicle about 9:30 p.m. Friday, Oct. 28, parked in the Walmart lot at 3999 Alpine Ave. NW. The deputy witnessed people in the car using marijuana. The deputy had a front seat passenger outside of the vehicle when that person elbowed the officer's face, police said. The person then resisted arrest and the deputy saw the person reach toward his waistband. The deputy also felt what seemed to be a handgun. Police said the deputy was able to remove the handgun from the person and distance himself. Soon after, the person was handcuffed and arrested. During the struggle, however, two others inside the vehicle fled the scene. Police called in a tracking dog but could not locate the other persons. The individual with the gun, a .380-caliber loaded semi-automatic handgun, was arrested on multiple charges.

(Ryan Stelting) Related Stories Unanswered questions about mysterious illness leading to British Airways emergency landing Walmart vows change amid concerns over food waste Here's how much food Walmart throws away over 12 days No replacement named for vacant child representative position Province's watchdog for children says government 'retaliated' against her Emotional ceremony marks anniversary of Tofino whale-watching tragedy One year after whale boat sinking, pain from Tofino tragedy remains Each week we put together a list of some of the stories you might have missed: those which dominated the news agenda, and some we just can't resist retelling. There are so many aspects of a potential aviation disaster that can strike fear deep down in our souls.  Commercial flights have long been proven to be one of the safest modes of travel, but incidents like the British Airways diversion this week have a way of confirming our worst fears.  Perhaps that's why our story of the flight being diverted to Vancouver on Monday, Oct. 24 while en route from San Francisco to London was by far our top story this week.  Many questions remain about what happened on the flight, but do read this great synopsis from our reporter Lisa Johnson about what we know and what we don't.  Crew aboard a British airways flight diverted to Vancouver this week were taken to hospital. The airline has yet to answer any questions as to why. (Ryan Stelting) Our other top story this week came from a former Walmart employee in the Vancouver area sharing his concerns about the "heartbreaking" amount of food dumped in the trash at the big retailer.  Daniel Schoeler says on every shift at almost every store, he saw loads of what appeared to be perfectly good food dumped in the trash, even though Walmart says it only discards inedible food.   The story, investigated by our Go Public and Marketplace teams, prompted Walmart to make a vow to change amid concerns over food waste. Daniel Schoeler says Walmart workers tossed what appeared to be perfectly good food into trash compactors on almost every shift he worked. (Erica Johnson/CBC) One of our stories this week, which is well worth a read if you missed it, was about the B.C.'s Representative for Children and Youth claiming the provincial government retaliated against her.  Many who have been affected by Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond's work say she is deeply respected for what she has done over the last 10 years as the province's first, and so far only, Representative for Children and Youth. As our reporter Richard Zussman summed up nicely last weekend, Turpel-Lafond has often had a tumultuous relationship with the province and leaves behind a complicated legacy.  It remains to be seen what the provincial government plans to do in her wake — no replacement has been announced yet.  Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond makes her final presentation as representative for children and youth to the Select Standing Committee on Children and Youth on Oct. 24, 2016. (Mike McArthur/CBC News) Lastly, if you haven't yet, do take time to read this story from our reporter Megan Thomas about the one-year anniversary of the Tofino whale-watching tragedy.  People travelled from as far as Australia to take part in the ceremony to honour the six people who died in the tragedy. But they were also there to celebrate those who survived, and the people who came to their rescue.  The bow of the Leviathan II, a whale-watching boat owned by Jamie's Whaling Station carrying 24 passengers and three crew members that capsized on Sunday, is seen near Vargas Island as it waits to be towed into Tofino, B.C., Tuesday, October 27, 2015 for inspection.

Susan Tripp Pollard — Bay Area News Group By Annie Sciacca, Bay Area News Group Posted: 10/30/16, 5:00 PM PDT | # Comments Dean Miller, of Concord, views holiday items Thursday at Orchard Supply Hardware in Pleasant Hill. “It jump starts people” said Miller in response to the early holiday displays. Susan Tripp Pollard — Bay Area News Group While many people may still be trying to nail down their trick-or-treating game plan, retailers in the Bay Area are way ahead: They’re pulling out the winter holiday decor and merchandise. Home improvement retailers have had their holiday lights on store floors for weeks. Crate and Barrel’s Walnut Creek store had Christmas items out next to its Halloween display by the third week of October. Palo Alto’s Stanford Shopping Center will have Santa Claus photo opportunities as early as Nov. 4. On Nov. 5, San Jose’s Santana Row will launch its “Holiday Makers Market,” and social media was flooded with posts from shoppers at Costco and Walmart stores who spotted sales on Christmas lights and other merchandise as early as September. AFTER THE TURKEY Martinez resident James Malkson said he remembers a time when retailers waited mostly until around Thanksgiving to unveil their Christmas and winter displays and merchandise. Now, he said, it seems to go up earlier each year, pointing to Christmas decor on display in Concord’s Sunvalley mall during the last week of October. Call it the “creep” part of the season, as in “Christmas creep” — that time of year when Christmas decor and merchandise creeps onto store shelves amidst the autumnal displays. Many people rail against it, citing pressure from stores to start their holiday buying too early, but retailers insist they would not begin so early if there weren’t demand. And studies show that many shoppers do like to get a head start on their holiday buying. People started inquiring about holiday hours and events at Sunvalley mall weeks ago, said Kim Trupiano, marketing director for the shopping center. Building the Christmas display often begins in the summer and takes a few weeks to put together inside the mall itself, Trupiano said. This year, it will be unveiled Nov. 11, which is when the mall will kick off its Santa program and other holiday events. MUCH PREPARATION For San Jose-based home improvement retailer Orchard Supply Hardware, preparing the holiday merchandise is a year-round project, said the company’s seasonal merchandise manager, Pam Burke. Burke begins forming ideas for the holiday merchandise a year ahead, gathering design ideas for themes and seeing what’s popular in different countries. The stores set up their holiday light products, which make up roughly half their seasonal product sales, as early as August. Decor products like artificial trees and table settings go up starting in September, and the stores typically complete their holiday set-up by the end of October, Burke said. “People say, ‘Oh, gosh, it’s too early,’ but if it’s something unique that they don’t see, they want to buy that early,” Burke said, noting that each year her team comes up with new themes for the displays and decor. So far, holiday merchandise sales are up 20 percent over the same period last year, she said. Advertisement According to the National Retail Federation’s holiday spending survey, approximately 40 percent of holiday shoppers say they begin their holiday shopping before Halloween, citing early bird shopping as a way to spread out their budgets and avoid holiday crowds and stress. Another 41.5 percent say they begin their holiday shopping in November, and 18.7 will begin sometime in December. A separate study from advertising technology company Rubicon Project found that nearly half of parents (47 percent) began their holiday shopping this year before Labor Day. OVERLOOKING THE SPIRIT Kit Yarrow, a consumer psychologist at San Francisco’s Golden Gate University, said that for some people, there is an angst associated with retailers getting an early start on holiday preparation because they worry about the “spirit” of the holiday getting overlooked. “I think people wonder if retailers are manipulating the meaning of the holiday, in some way,” Yarrow said, noting that those who either abhor or embrace the early start to the holiday shopping season often have the same motivation: avoiding the commercialization of the holidays. Some want to get an early start to avoid the crowds and chaos, while others don’t want the pressure of shopping so early. Janie Peterson, who lives in Benicia and often shops in the East Bay, said she does not like the general “commercialization” of the Christmas holiday, but she does like that an early start to the season means she can get her holiday shopping done early and avoid the crowds later on. Malkson, in spotting the Sunvalley mall’s Christmas decor, was less forgiving. “Gee, can’t we get by Thanksgiving first?” Subscribe to Home Delivery and SAVE!

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Oct 30, 2016 at 3:31PM Walk down the aisles of your local grocery store or big box retailer, and you are faced with a sometimes overwhelming selection of thousands of products. But even then, that is only a small subset of the more than one million items available to consumers each year. In this Industry Focus: Consumer Goods segment, the cast considers the challenges of competing in an environment with seemingly limitless consumer options and what that implies for consumer staples manufacturers like Unilever and Procter & Gamble. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 12, 2016. Vincent Shen: I really wanted to hammer the point home in terms of how important these efforts can be for companies by stepping back a little bit and giving a little bit of a big picture context and calling out some numbers that I think can put things into perspective. For example, in 2008 research from the Food Marketing Institute the typical U.S. grocery store, or supermarket, stocked about 47,000 different products. That is up 50% from the previous decade and about five-fold since 1975. Keep in mind that a Wal-Mart Supercenter, for example, their SKU numbers for a store that size is well over 100,000. And then if you go a step further, researching the case at any one time in the United States, there are at least one million products on the market for consumers to purchase. So that research might be a few years old now, so with some of the other trends that we've seen, you can imagine that number is likely much larger than one million at this point with customization, for example. So the sobering reality I think for a lot of retailers, be it Unilever or Procter & Gamble, is that consumers only use about 340 unique items in a year out of that one million-plus. And making sure that you are maximizing your profitability, maximizing your product mix and what is on store shelves, to boost your revenue and make sure that that small subset of items that each consumer uses includes products from your portfolio, is just really important. Is there any other thoughts that you wanted to leave our listeners with, Asit? Asit Sharma: Just one last thought. And by the way, those are some mind-boggling statistics and I think that really visually gives us an idea of how much supply there is out there of product and why it's a great idea to reduce as much as you can if you're a manufacturer. My last point is that we see the Pareto Principle in life a lot, which is 80% of outputs are due to 20% of inputs. See that in so many different spheres of life, and manufacturers have found this to be very true ... SKU and brand rationalization, that a lot of times it's just a few products that are really driving your sales and your profits, so why wouldn't you put in the effort to pare those down and optimize your profit and optimize your cash flow? As investors, we should be looking for the companies which are actively trying to perform this exercise. And the two companies we've mentioned today are really into this. Their management talks about these concepts almost every conference call, we see it in the numbers, and it's a great way to evaluate a consumer goods company. Are they paying attention to the proliferation of products that they've got, and are they trying to make themselves more efficient as time goes on?

Brian Stoffel (TMFCheesehead) Oct 30, 2016 at 12:13PM Image source: Getty Images. For years, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) defied every logical expectation for an established fast-casual restaurant. In 2014, comparable-store sales (comps) grew 16.8% -- an almost unheard-of pace for a company its size. The first half of 2015 was more of the same, with comps up 10.4% and 14.1% during the first and second quarters, respectively. But during the summer, stories surfaced out of the West Coast about norovirus and E. coli outbreaks related to Chipotle. It didn't stop there: The food-related illness outbreak spread across the country before dying down by December. By then, the damage was done. And the company has been trying to recover since. Comps have been down by over 20% each quarter since late 2015, and shares are off 50% from their 2015 highs. Motley Fool analyst Brian Stoffel has already declared that he'll be selling the stock when trading rules allow. But John Maxfield has no plans for selling his stake anytime soon. Below, Brian presents his core argument for selling his shares, while John has a chance to respond to Brian's concerns. Food safety is a catalyst, not the cause Brian Stoffel: I was a longtime -- and vocally supportive -- shareholder of Whole Foods (NASDAQ:WFM). I loved the company's commitment to all stakeholders and its aggressive role in bringing healthy eating into the nation's consciousness. For a long time, the approach worked very well for shareholders. Until it didn't. Starting in 2013, the competition started crushing Whole Foods' growth ambitions. Costco, Wal-Mart, and, most notably, Kroger came out with their own in-house organic options. For the general public, this was a win-win: People are eating healthier food that is more responsibly grown for less money. But for Whole Foods shareholders, it hasn't been pretty. Comps have been negative, and the company's shares have lost over 55% of their value since hitting 2013 highs. In short, Whole Foods really had no sustainable competitive advantage -- people will get their organic goods wherever they are offered. While lots of people are worried about the food safety issues at Chipotle, I actually think that's a catalyst for the stock's long-term downtrend, not the cause. Instead, I'm worried about Chipotle playing out in much the same fashion that Whole Foods did. Chipotle was the first national chain to focus on ethically sourced food made fresh in-house, with a very simple menu to boot. That first-mover status led to massive investor gains. But there's nothing to stop the competition from copying the exact same thing. Already, similarly focused competitors are cropping up like wildfire, while more entrenched players shift their menu focus. This isn't to say I think Chipotle is doomed. I believe it will survive just fine, and they can surely count on me as a customer moving forward. But trading at 52 times trailing earnings -- and 36 times estimates for next year -- I just don't think the stock is worth what it's trading for right now. A Chipotle bull's response John Maxfield: What sticks out to me in Brian's argument is the distinction between the food-safety issues being a catalyst for a potential long-term downtrend in Chipotle's stock as opposed to being the cause. I find that to be extremely insightful. But I nevertheless disagree with it. To say that the food-safety issues Chipotle has experienced over the past year are a catalyst is to suggest that they are merely contributing to an otherwise independent downward trend. The cause of that trend, if I'm interpreting Brian correctly, is the encroachment of competitors. It'd be silly for me to claim that competitors won't move into Chipotle's space. We've seen this with Qdoba, a subsidiary of Jack in the Box, but also with the proliferation of fast-casual chains such as Noodles & Co. and Panera Bread. But there's plenty of space for all of these companies to thrive. This is particularly true when you consider the enormous amount of market share that Chipotle and its fast-casual competitors can continue to steal away from fast-food giants such as McDonalds, Wendy's, and Burger King. Additionally, Chipotle is still at the beginning of its lifecycle as a food chain. It's building roughly 200 new locations a year. Its same-store sales will almost certainly begin growing once again in the first quarter of next year. It has yet to expand internationally in a meaningful way. And it has a number of additional arrows in its quiver that it can deploy to boost sales at existing restaurants -- most importantly, introducing breakfast and desserts. Image source: Chipotle. Let me also point out that Chipotle's management has proven to be extremely adept at capital allocation, buying back nearly 7% of its outstanding common stock since its share price plummeted in the fourth quarter of last year. As William Thorndike notes in his excellent book, The Outsiders, it's this skill that underlies the most successful CEOs in the United States since World War II. In short, I understand why people are concerned about Chipotle's future. But as a great investor once said, one objective when buying stocks is to be "fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful."

For the general public, this was a win-win: People are eating healthier food that is more responsibly grown for less money. But for Whole Foods shareholders, it hasn't been pretty. Comps have been negative, and the company's shares have lost over 55% of their value since hitting 2013 highs. In short, Whole Foods really had no sustainable competitive advantage -- people will get their organic goods wherever they are offered. While lots of people are worried about the food safety issues at Chipotle, I actually think that's a catalyst for the stock's long-term downtrend, not the cause. Instead, I'm worried about Chipotle playing out in much the same fashion that Whole Foods did. Chipotle was the first national chain to focus on ethically sourced food made fresh in-house, with a very simple menu to boot. That first-mover status led to massive investor gains. But there's nothing to stop the competition from copying the exact same thing. Already, similarly focused competitors are cropping up like wildfire, while more entrenched players shift their menu focus. This isn't to say I think Chipotle is doomed. I believe it will survive just fine, and they can surely count on me as a customer moving forward. But trading at 52 times trailing earnings -- and 36 times estimates for next year -- I just don't think the stock is worth what it's trading for right now. A Chipotle bull's response John Maxfield: What sticks out to me in Brian's argument is the distinction between the food-safety issues being a catalyst for a potential long-term downtrend in Chipotle's stock as opposed to being the cause. I find that to be extremely insightful. But I nevertheless disagree with it. To say that the food-safety issues Chipotle has experienced over the past year are a catalyst is to suggest that they are merely contributing to an otherwise independent downward trend. The cause of that trend, if I'm interpreting Brian correctly, is the encroachment of competitors. It'd be silly for me to claim that competitors won't move into Chipotle's space. We've seen this with Qdoba, a subsidiary of Jack in the Box, but also with the proliferation of fast-casual chains such as Noodles & Co. and Panera Bread. But there's plenty of space for all of these companies to thrive. This is particularly true when you consider the enormous amount of market share that Chipotle and its fast-casual competitors can continue to steal away from fast-food giants such as McDonalds, Wendy's, and Burger King. Additionally, Chipotle is still at the beginning of its lifecycle as a food chain. It's building roughly 200 new locations a year. Its same-store sales will almost certainly begin growing once again in the first quarter of next year. It has yet to expand internationally in a meaningful way. And it has a number of additional arrows in its quiver that it can deploy to boost sales at existing restaurants -- most importantly, introducing breakfast and desserts. Image source: Chipotle. Let me also point out that Chipotle's management has proven to be extremely adept at capital allocation, buying back nearly 7% of its outstanding common stock since its share price plummeted in the fourth quarter of last year. As William Thorndike notes in his excellent book, The Outsiders, it's this skill that underlies the most successful CEOs in the United States since World War II. In short, I understand why people are concerned about Chipotle's future. But as a great investor once said, one objective when buying stocks is to be "fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful."

X TV preview: Making Ireland Click, Bublé at the BBC and more David Puttnam steps into his new role as Ireland’s Digital Champion; supercrooner Michael Bublé steps up to the mic Sun, Oct 30, 2016, 12:39 Kevin Courtney The president’s daughter: Hayley Atwell in Conviction, Wednesday, Sky Living, 9pm         Ireland’s Fittest Family Sunday, RTÉ One, 6.30pm Once again it’s time for 12 superfit families to test their mettle, stay the course and aim for that €15,000 prize. This year, the challenges are even more challenging, the terrain even rougher and the courses even more gruelling. They’ll be coached by four sporting legends: ex-Clare hurling manager Davy Fitzgerald, Cork camogie star Anna Geary, Munster and Ireland rugby legend Alan Quinlan and – joining the coaching team this year – former Irish international soccer star Stephen Hunt. (Can’t wait to see what the couch- potato families on Gogglebox Ireland make of this.) Making Ireland Click Monday, RTÉ One, 7.30pm Oscar-winning film producer David Puttnam has a new role to play these days. The political activist and member of the House of Lords, who lives in Skibbereen, is Ireland’s Digital Champion (apparently, that’s a thing), and he’s on a mission to get Irish people digitally literate. Digital technology has taken over nearly every aspect of our lives, but not everyone is driving along the same information superhighway. Some are still tootling along on the digital side-roads, and Puttnam is hoping to get everyone in Ireland up to speed on the fast-changing technologies that are fast changing our lives. In the first episode, Puttnam meets the “non-liners”, people who have resisted the pull of the new technology, and sees how older people are in danger of being left behind in the rush to living our lives online. Unarmed Black Male Wednesday, BBC Two, 9pm In April 2015, police officer Stephen Rankin arrived at a Walmart store in response to a report of shoplifting. Within minutes he had shot and killed black teenager William Chapman. This 90-minute documentary brings us inside the trial of Rankin, who was charged with first-degree murder. In 2015, a total of 306 black men were killed by police in the US, but just 14 police officers were charged with any wrongdoing. Made by award-winning filmmaker James Jones, this documentary promises to be a powerful indictment of law enforcement in the US. ADVERTISEMENT Television’s Opening Night: How The Box Was Born Wednesday, BBC4, 9pm In a unique experiment, Dallas Campbell, Prof Danielle George and Dr Hugh Hunt join forces in an attempt to restage the very first official broadcast on British Television, exactly 80 years after it made history. The inaugural BBC transmission was made from Alexandra Palace in London on November 2nd 1936. But there are no recordings of the event - so, to find out just went on, the team will attempt to piece back together every aspect of show from scratch – from the cogs, gears and electron beams of the new technology to the dancing girls and other variety acts that were broadcast that historic night. Conviction Wednesday, Sky Living, 9pm She was only the president’s daughter . . . Hayley Atwell stars in this new legal thriller series as brilliant young lawyer Hayes Morrison, whose father was once the US president. She’s trying to get out from under her dad’s shadow and make it on her own terms, but she’s also battling a few demons, and when New York district attorney Conner Wallace uncovers one of these, he blackmails her into working for the Conviction Integrity Unit, which investigates possible wrongful convictions. Atwell is best known as Marvel’s Agent Carter – can she make this another memorable role? The jury’s out. Bublé at the BBC Thursday, BBC One, 8pm With Christmas on the way, it’ll soon be time to dig out our well-scratched copy of Michael Buble’s festive CD. But if you can’t wait until December to hear the dulcet tones of the Canadian crooner, you can catch him in a one-hour special, Here, Claudia Winkleman puts aside her Strictly shoes to interview Bublé about becoming a father and how he got started in his career, and the singer performs his many hits in front of a live studio audience, backed by his band and a 30-piece orchestra.

From Burma to Buffalo Life in a new jungle Refugees like Swoin Paw struggle mightily with language and culture disparities By Jerry Zremski / News Washington Bureau Chief Photography by Derek Gee / News Chief Photographer Swoin Paw could not understand much of what the “IRS agent” with the foreign accent said when he called, demanding $9,500. But he knew what the caller meant when he threatened jail. Within hours, the slim, scruffy, sad-eyed refugee from Burma paid $8,200 to a fraudster. “I didn’t understand,” Swoin Paw, who is now 40, said through an interpreter at his home in Buffalo’s Riverside neighborhood. For Buffalo’s refugees from Burma, acclimation is a struggle. Few speak English: Like Swoin Paw, they say they work too long and too hard to find the time to learn it. Many find American ways as foreign as the language, particularly when it comes to disciplining children. Victims of violence in the country they fled, they isolate themselves in the country they moved to, forming their own community groups and churches where they speak their own languages and preserve their old customs. In a recent survey of 240 adult refugees from Burma conducted by a University at Buffalo professor, respondents identified much more with their native culture than with America. Click on any photo to view the associated gallery. “A lot of the people, they don’t even write their own language,” said Smiler Greely, who told his own refugee story in the 2010 film “Nickel City Smiler.” “They don’t really know what to do here. They grew up in the jungle.” When that fraudster called Swoin Paw in spring 2014, saying all those foreign things in a foreign language with a foreign accent, Swoin Paw ran upstairs to fetch his neighbor, May Say. She was 18, and had dropped out of Riverside High School after getting pregnant. She spoke English. May Say picked up the phone and listened. The caller sounded foreign, she says. And he sounded serious. “My God,” May Say told Swoin Paw. “You owe money for back taxes. And if you don’t pay, they are going to put you in jail.” From left, Smiler Greeley chats with Aung Kaung Myat, Law Eh Sey and Eden in the hallway outside the council chambers at City Hall after a meeting of the Common Council Police Oversight Committee at which the community challenged their treatment by police, March 10, 2015. (Derek Gee/Buffalo News) Swoin Paw had only $5,000 in savings. Don’t worry, May Say said. Her family had $2,000. On the spot, she decided to give it to Swoin Paw. Swoin Paw called another friend, who agreed to chip in $1,200. Over the next few hours, following the caller’s instructions, Swoin Paw and his neighbor drove from one store to another, from a CVS to a WalMart to a Walgreens to a Rite Aid, to wire the money in chunks to the “IRS agent” with the 202 area code. The caller insisted that May Say stay on the line the whole time. She did – until they got home and told Swoin Paw’s wife, Eh Sher Paw, what was happening. She had heard of such schemes and knew it must be a fraud. She told May Say to hang up. Eh Sher Paw, a stout, round-faced woman given to smiling in spite of it all, said through an interpreter that she was angry at her husband. “But I didn’t want him to feel hurt, so I just held it in,” she said. “And then I cried.” Telling his story while sitting on the floor of his bare-bones living room, which he had meant to renovate with the money he lost to the con man, Swoin Paw looked as if he wanted to cry, too. None of this would have happened, he said, if he had known English. A decade after his arrival, Swoin Paw’s English vocabulary is small – which makes him a typical refugee. Isok Kim, the assistant professor of social work at UB who surveyed the refugees from Burma, found that 79 percent had poor English skills. The local agencies that resettle refugees in Buffalo offer classes, and refugees generally are required to take them if they are not yet working. But dozens of refugees said they stopped taking classes because they had to work. That traps them in low-wage jobs. Swoin Paw tends to the plants in the greenhouses of Wheatfield Gardens. “So many of them don’t read, they don’t write,” said Eh Knyaw, president of the Karen Society of Buffalo, which represents the city’s largest ethnic group of refugees from Burma. “In a case like that, you can only be a dishwasher.” Henry Zayamoe, a baby-faced 23-year-old who is now fluent in English, recalled getting hopelessly lost during his early days in Buffalo because he couldn’t read street signs. Other refugees said they dread calls from doctors or their children’s teachers because they don’t understand what is being said. Dozens of refugees from Burma and other countries line up every day at the Hope Refugee Drop-in Center on West Ferry Street, waiting for a translator to read their mail to them or help them fill out forms for government benefits. Henry Zayamoe, 21 when this photo was taken in 2015, a refugee from Shan State, Burma who moved to Buffalo one year ago, participates in a class project during social studies class in the Making a Connection (MAC) program, a program for refugee teens designed to help them achieve advanced English skills and a GED for students who would age out of traditional high school before earning enough credits for a diploma, Wednesday, April 1, 2015. (Derek Gee/Buffalo News) Swoin Paw was napping on his living room sofa on a Friday afternoon in April 2013 when he heard a young boy’s cries. His 9-year-old nephew had pushed his 6-year-old brother down the landing on the stairs. Swoin Paw did what he said his father would have done. He yelled at the 9-year-old and slapped the boy on the face. Swoin Paw then tended to the 6-year-old to make sure he was all right. The older boy did what he learned in school. He called 911. Minutes later, a squad car arrived at Swoin Paw’s house. According to the police report, officers found “fingerprints embedded on the child’s neck” and sent the 9-year-old to Women & Children’s Hospital for treatment. The officers arrested Swoin Paw. At the city lockup, he donned an orange jumpsuit, waited and prayed. Until an interpreter arrived, he didn’t know why he was there. His sister bailed him out, and records in the case show the charges were dismissed after six months. Prosecutors and defense attorneys often agree to such a resolution when circumstances warrant no further legal action. Swoin Paw keeps an eye on the children playing on the porch of his Riverside home, Saturday, Sept. 17, 2016. (Derek Gee/Buffalo News) Dozens of adult refugees interviewed for this series said they struggle to learn a new way of raising children. It’s not that the refugees routinely beat their children. The county’s Child Protective Services office has noted nothing disproportional about the number of cases from the Burmese refugee community, said Albert Dirschberger, Erie County’s commissioner of social services. “There is a cultural difference,” said Lisa Bloch Rodwin, chief Family Court judge in Erie County. “What’s acceptable in many foreign cultures is not acceptable here.” Mu Te, a delicate refugee from Burma in her early 30s, learned that the hard way on a summer day outside her Black Rock/Riverside home six years ago. Her daughter, then 5, biked into the busy street, so Mu Te ran out and grabbed her and beat her. When the little girl fled, Mu Te threw a rock at her. A neighbor called the police. Mu Te – who was pregnant at the time – was jailed for a week and later served probation. “This was 100 percent lack of knowledge,” said Mu Te, crying. “I didn’t understand the rules and regulations here.” The rules and regulations here say that as soon as parents leave a mark on a child’s body, they can be charged with a crime. Kids in school are warned about child abuse. That leads to murky child protection cases where a child calls 911 out of anger rather than abuse, said Myra Dahgaypaw, a refugee from Burma who serves as policy adviser for the U.S. Campaign for Burma in Washington, D.C. “The kids always threaten their parents with 911. And sometimes they call, and parents have to go to jail for these reasons,” she said. “How do we cope with this kind of problem?” Thaw Sit Naing, 3, left, and Nansu Nadoo Nadee, 3, get acclimated with the staff as they arrive with their mothers for a parenting discussion at the Jewish Family Services, March 9, 2015. (Derek Gee/Buffalo News) Like most refugees, Swoin Paw lived a hard life far away that defines him. In Thailand, he was arrested three times – for working. He grew up in a village that escapees from Burma set up in western Thailand. There are many such villages, each a collection of bamboo huts that makes the nearby refugee camps look new and neat. The Thai government considers the villagers illegal immigrants. When he got old enough, Swoin Paw did menial farm labor, even though it was illegal. So Thai police arrested him again and again. The last time he spent a month in jail, sleeping on a dirt floor in a barracks with 200 other inmates. That was enough. In 1997, Swoin Paw and his wife moved to a refugee camp west of Bangkok. And when the United States and Thailand struck a deal to allow refugees from the camp to be among the first from Burma to move to America, Swoin Paw and his wife applied. His life now is much better, he said. He works, his kids are in school and there is enough money to keep the family fed and clothed. “In Thailand,” he said, “we had nothing.” Men walk into a village of displaced Karen exiles called Kyout Sat outside of Mae Sot, Thailand, Monday, April 27, 2015. (Derek Gee/Buffalo News) Buffalo’s refugees from Burma fled a military government that tried to wipe out ethnic minorities. “I’m coming from a not very civil society, and here is a very civil society,” said Myo Thant, a political prisoner in Burma who came to Buffalo after winning asylum in the United States. “I’m not going to fit in right away.” Separated by different languages and cultures, Burma’s ethnic groups – the Karen, Karenni, Chin, Burmese, Arakanese and Rohingya, plus several others – typically form their own community organizations and religious groups. And it is there that the refugees find community in Buffalo. Hundreds turned out in February for Chin National Day in North Buffalo. One group of young men and women danced in elaborate red-and-white costumes. Another group of dancers, all men, wore shorts, long plaid sashes and red headdresses with feathers. “The Chin culture and the American culture are just very different,” said Joshua Thawng Lian, president of the Chin Society of Buffalo. Many refugees find more frequent refuge in the churches they have set up in Buffalo. Swoin Paw and his wife socialize mostly with a few close friends from the Karen Baptist Church. He said the church is filled with people just like him, people working hard to support their families, good family men and women. Their children have friends from outside the Karen community, but Swoin Paw and his wife said they fit in best with people who share their language and understand their experiences. The church, they said, feels a bit like home. Swoin Paw, sits on the floor of his living room, Sunday, Sept. 18, 2016. (Derek Gee/Buffalo News) Editor's note: The Buffalo News is using the name "Burma," rather than "Myanmar," because refugees generally refer to the nation as Burma, as does the U.S. government. Burma's military regime revived the nation's ancient name of Myanmar in 1989 in hopes of defusing ethnic tensions. In addition, refugees will be referred to consistently by their full names in this series. That is because natives of Burma don't have first and last names: their full name identifies them at all times.

PHOTO COURTESY ALLIANCE FOR FAIR FOOD Story of farmworkers’ struggle coming to Centro Tuesday Sun, 10/30/2016 - 5:40am Anita Miller It’s not everyday a recent Presidential Medal winner passes through San Marcos.  Nor is it everyday the White House bestows the accolade, practically unparalleled in prestige, to a grassroots group of low-wage farmworkers, of all things for “extraordinary efforts at combatting modern-day slavery.” Yet Tuesday evening, Lupe Gonzalo, an organizer with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers — a community group of tomato pickers hailing from Guatemala and Mexico, working in Florida’s agricultural fields — will grace San Marcos with a talk about the colossal success of her organization in fighting a range of abuses once rampant in the industry, earning them White House recognition last January. The CIW’s “Campaign for Fair Food” — triumphant efforts to persuade a dozen multi-billiondollar companies to improve pay and work conditions for tens of thousands of tomato harvesters — is compellingly documented in the award-winning film FOOD CHAINS, which Cinema Club will screen at 7 p.m. at Centro Comunitario Hispano on Tuesday. Gonzalo will speak afterward. Gonzalo, a longtime leader of the CIW, will be in San Marcos as part of a statewide tour to educate supporters about her group’s attempt to get Wendy’s to join their Fair Food Program; Wendy’s is the only of the nation’s five largest fast-food retailers to not yet sign on.  Following numerous high-profile, slavery prosecutions in Florida’s fields — involving more than 1,200 forced-labor victims since 1997 — and sustained consumer campaigns, CIW has managed to prompt companies like Walmart, Burger King, Subway, Pizza Hut and McDonald’s to sign legally-binding agreements that boost wages and enact a strict workplace code of conduct to protect farmworkers’ human rights. Texas State University’s food-service provider, Compass Group, is another company that joined the Fair Food Program in 2009. Last year, Secretary of State John Kerry said of the CIW, upon presentation of the Presidential Medal: “Those of you know Florida’s tomato sector already know about the risks of forced labor, and some farm workers in Florida are in the fields for 12 hours a day, seven days a week. They live in deplorable conditions. They suffer beatings and sexual harassment, and many are paid hardly anything for the tomatoes that they pick. But thanks to the Fair Food Program, the tomato workers in the fields do not have to face these abuses. The CIW has organized communities, stood by tomato workers for more than 20 years, and changed the face of this industry. They’ve pioneered a zero tolerance policy that puts workers and social responsibility at the absolute center.” For several years, Gonzalo has also helped organize a weekly meeting of farmworker women in Immokalee,  a rural town almost entirely comprised of men.  She and her colleagues have spearheaded multiple protests led by farmworker women and dozens of spirited children outside of supermarkets and fast-food companies that refuse to join Fair Food efforts. Gonzalo is also a popular deejay on Radio Conciencia 107.7 FM, a low-power station broadcasting through the Everglades, with programming over the years consisting of deejays speaking Spanish, Haitian Creole and a few indigenous Mayan languages.   The radio was credited with rescuing lives during Hurricane Wilma in 2005 — providing crucial emergency information to farmworkers in their native languages while coordinating an urgent carpool to move scores of trailer-park dwelling residents to safety. Gonzalo will speak Tuesday on Texas State campus at 3:30 p.m. in the Philosophy Dialogue Room (Comal 116) as part of an Honors Non-Violence course, in addition to her talk after the Food Chains screening that same evening at Centro, where newly constructed altars for Dia de los Muertos are available for viewing.   • Submitted by San Marcos  Cinema Club   Section:  News Advertisement Search the site Search Tweets by SanMarcosRecord Popular content Today's: Trump’s message resonated unheard San Marcos High School’s Air Force JROTC supports HCWC with donation Kissing Tree Golf Course construction underway Hays County Brown Santa gearing up for holiday toy and food drive Downtown protest Related Articles Wayne G.

Right before the cooking-heavy months of November and December, Amazon rolled out a monthly payment option for its grocery delivery service, AmazonFresh. On Monday it expanded to several new cities including Chicago and Dallas. Amazon – which has been working on expanding grocery delivery since 2007 – is taking aim at the $650 billion grocery industry. It’s a highly competitive arena filled with rivals like Walmart and Instacart trying to lure customers away from traditional grocery stores. Some reports suggest that Amazon plans to open grocery stores of its own, but the company has declined to comment. “Grocery is a massive market opportunity for them,” said R.W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian. It’s a notoriously tough business with low margins, since it’s expensive to store and transport produce. But Amazon has spent years ironing out the kinks with its delivery service, he said. Amazon near-decade of experimentation “gives them the scale and expertise that comes with time, allowing them not only to fine tune the service, but also perhaps accelerate the rollout into other areas,” Sebastian said. Humble Beginnings Amazon started its grocery delivery business around its home town of Seattle, and has since expanded to about 18 cities and regions, including London and New York. It has changed its pricing structure, too, having started with an annual $299 fee that included Prime membership. Its monthly pricing program – $15 a month for members of its $99-a-year Prime loyalty program – started earlier this month. Amazon doesn’t disclose whether or not grocery delivery is profitable, but analysts say it’s probably not. Rather, it’s a way to drive revenue growth and hook users into the idea that they can buy every product from Amazon. “They have a user base with Prime that is inclined to use Amazon, and they’re clearly leveraging that loyal membership base,” Sebastian said. Amazon’s monthly pricing model could indicate the business has become less of a money loser. “I think they’ve gotten to the point they can be more flexible,” Sebastian said. “It’s an expensive business to run and that flexibility in pricing shows they’ve gained some efficiencies.” Ever-expanding Prime Amazon has been continuously adding services to its Prime loyalty program, which offers free two-day shipping on many items and boasts an estimated 65 million members (Amazon does not disclose the figure). It also includes streaming music and video, photo storage and other perks. Adding services like grocery delivery and original video programming costs money, but Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos says it’s worth it because Prime members spend more at Amazon. “If you become a Prime member you buy more from us,” he said at a luncheon in New York on Thursday. And people that watch Prime Instant Video, for example, are more likely to convert from free trials to paid Prime membership, and are more likely to renew their Prime membership in subsequent years, he said. “That’s what closes the loop from the business angle,” he said. After posting little-to-no profit for years each quarter as it invested in its business, Amazon has begun to balance spending with revenue more prudently and has reported a profit in each of the past five quarters.

Wish is raising again, and giving late-stage investors protection Posted Oct 28, 2016 by Connie Loizos (@cookie) 0 SHARES Next Story Tesla’s Powerwall 2 packs over twice the energy storage Wish, a San Francisco-based e-commerce mobile app that’s taken off in the U.S. and Europe by selling watches, clothing and other items extremely cheaply, is raising a new round of funding, a new filing shows. (The research company CB Insights spied the filing first.) Neither the size of the round nor the valuation are included, but the filing shows that Series F investors coming into the round are receiving liquidation preferences that will allow them to get paid ahead of earlier investors — which isn’t uncommon in later-stage funding rounds. A survey released in August by the law firm Fenwick & West — one that analyzed the venture financings of 195 Silicon Valley-based companies over the second quarter — showed that senior liquidation preferences were featured in 30 percent of financings. Wish’s CEO, Peter Szulczewski, is notoriously press shy, but he came to a StrictlyVC event hosted in February by this editor and shared numerous details about the business, which previously raised $600 million from investors and was reportedly last valued at $3 billion. (According to the app-analytics firm App Annie, it’s also the second-most popular shopping app in the U.S., and the 39th most popular app overall.) We published our notes after that February interview; in case you missed them, we’re republishing them here, below. On his background: Szulczewski, a computer scientist by training, noted that he’d spent 6.5 years at Google solving “really big matching problems” before cofounding his company, ContextLogic, from which Wish evolved. The idea was to build a next-generation, mobile ad network to compete with Google’s AdSense network, whose tech was “relatively stale” at the time, in 2011. Szulscewski and his cofounder, Danny Zhang, realized they were “pretty bad at business development,” though, so eventually pivoted to Wish. Wish began as an app that asked people to create wish lists, then the company approached merchants, letting them know a certain number of customers wanted, say, a certain type of table. Things took off from there, he said. On the merchants Wish works with and the types of merchandise it sells: “We thought that being more relevant and showing the right recommendations would be critical; what we didn’t predict was the types of products and the types of merchants. “Because shopping on smartphones is relatively new and sort of an impulsive experience, the average order value tends to be relatively low. I don’t think people are comfortable with buying a $5,000 TV on their phone. I think even $300 is high, as most people want to compare prices, read through reviews, etcetera. People were willing to spend $20, $30, $50, but not much more than that [which we learned]. “Another part of our hypothesis that did work was that we’d be so good at relevance that these merchants would ship these things directly from their distribution centers and factories, and we’d cut out all the middle men. But were naïve [about who would do this]. A brand like Nike isn’t going to do that; it would be undercutting all its other retailers and its brand, on which it spends a lot of marketing dollars. “[On the other hand], if you’re an unbranded merchant who’s selling a dress or a wall mount, you just have your manufacturing and shipping costs, and those are the people we work really well with and why we have such good prices. We know who’s interested in fishing, and our merchants can reach them for free. The value proposition for the consumer is really cheap stuff. For merchants, it’s, ‘Hey, I don’t have to do anything. I just upload a CSV file or do it through an API or enter it manually, and I just start seeing sales.’ “The two biggest biggest retailers in the world are Walmart — which sees revenue of half a trillion dollars a year, primarily from U.S. customers — and the Alibaba subsidiary Taobao, which is the biggest platform in China. And both focus on value-conscious consumers. [That’s because] the median household in the U.S. is around $52,000 a year. In Europe, it’s even lower.” On how big the company is, and how much of each transaction it takes: “Last year, [gross merchandise sales] was single-digit billions. It took us just under three years or so to get there. We do charge a take rate of 15 percent. Part of the reason is we do a lot more than, say, Alibaba, which doesn’t charge a take rate. “Take your local merchant in Shenzhen, where the majority of the world’s goods are manufactured, both branded and unbranded. That merchant has no idea how to sell to people in the Netherlands, France, Brazil, the U.S., Australia. He also has no idea how to communicate with those customers, so we take care of all of that. What merchants get in return [is] suddenly, they get an additional audience of more than a billion smartphone users who don’t really cannibalize their existing market.” In explaining how Wish, which ships many things for a $1, is able to do that: “We’re shipping little things – not TVs or motorcyles or bicycles. And it turns out it’s relatively cheap to do that. Even by air, it will cost $1 or $2 unless the item is unusually heavy or large. [Largely we rely on a partnership between the USPS and China called ePacket.]  I think most countries have these kinds of treaties. I’m not sure what percentage of our goods use the program, but it’s really efficient. Everything is shipped by air and it’s surprisingly cost effective.” If that program went away? “From what we’ve heard, the partners involved are very happy with it. If it goes away, it goes away for everyone, so the prices would probably rise for everyone. But we also have interesting back-up solutions even if it does.” On how long it takes customers to receive their goods: “In the U.S., the average time is 13 days or so. Across the world, it’s maybe a little higher. In certain countries like Brazil where logistics aren’t as optimized and there may be much more regulation around imports, it could be as long as 30 days on average, so it really depends on the market.” Answering which are the best-selling products on the platform: “Initially, it was a lot of fashion. Then we got make-up, home décor – cheaper or smaller items. What’s really taking off now is a lot of hobby stuff. Certain parts for cars, for example. Things for people who are into fishing gear, paintball, surfing, photography, drones. So a lot of different sets of users are coming who don’t need a branded good but need something that works, like fishing bait.” In response to a question about about non-discretionary items and whether we’ll see Wish take on Amazon more directly by selling items like paper towels: “The answer is yes and that’s starting to happen. There’s one package of like 20 toothbrushes that costs $3 dollars that we’re selling tens of thousands of every month. Paper towels are too large and too heavy to ship out of China but maybe we have a partnership with someone here who ships it out of their warehouse and we offer it that way. So we are thinking about non-discretionary more and more and it’s starting to creep into our platform.” Addressing reports that Wish has talked with Alibaba and Amazon and they want to buy the company for billions of dollars (which Szulczewski largely dodged): “We realized early on that unless you set out to build a really massive, self-sustainable business, you’re just not going to be able to do it. Basically, really big companies have these people in corp dev, god bless you [laughs], but there’s this asymmetry, which is like: the founders’ time is the most precious commodity that you have. You only have 24 hours a day. But there are corp dev people at these companies who have an infinite amount of time to spend with these founders… We want to build a self-sustainable business. We think that just like Alibaba, just like Walmart, we can get to hundreds of billions [of dollars in market cap]. I think both those companies were built on the same premise of saving time and money for their consumers. We’re doing the same thing on your phone.” On whether JD.com, China’s second biggest e-commerce player, is now an investor in Wish: “I was at Yuri Milner’s house for some kind of dinner party, and I met Richard [Liu], who’s the founder and CEO of JD, and I find their business fascinating; it’s the exact opposite of what we do. [Editor’s note: Unlike Wish and Alibaba, which directly connect buyers and sellers, JD is more like Amazon, buying branded goods from manufacturers, storing the inventory in its own warehouses and, once purchased, delivering the goods quickly – often the same day.] I think JD has the best logistics in the world. They have 80,000 employees delivering these goods. And we’re the exact opposite, so we struck up an relationship and we could probably learn a lot from them, and they could probably learn a lot from us, because we’re not competing because they’re not really doing anything outside of China and we’re not entering China, at all. So we really like them and yes, they invested $50 million in the last round.” On the company’s priorities going forward: “We take a tech-driven approach to curation and it’s slowly evolving to be more pretty and I think we’ll get there. But every time we try curation — the algorithm, in terms of conversion — it just destroys any kind of curation. It’s an order of magnitude difference. So we’re always trying things and maybe there’s a way to algorithmically curate [a prettier] interface. So that’s always been a priority for us. “[Another priority is] customer purchase experience, which is, ‘Hey, maybe for some of the products where we can forecast the sales really accurately, you should be able to get them in less than three days.’ That’s probably possible for half the GMV if we’re running at scale. “We’re also focusing more on customer support, which was, last year, up until November, horrific. Now it’s getting better.” Addressing how much repeat business Wish sees: “If you think of the rise of Taobao, they’re at 50 purchases per user per year. Amazon is at 15, by the way, which I’ve heard from many people and I think is accurate [information]. I think JD is somewhere below Amazon – they don’t give me that kind of data. “We’re at 5 purchases per year and that’s growing relatively quickly. We’re not something you use every week but we certainly want to be. As think as long as we can provide the most bang for the buck for consumers, we’ll get there.” On educating Chinese merchants, who not accustomed to thinking about the lifetime value of customers: “It’s true that consumer expectations in China are very different. Like, if you order a red sweater and you get a blue one, [shoppers are] like, ‘Eh, next time.’ So we have a lot of merchants that have only sold to Chinese consumers and we have to educate them that it’s not okay to ship a blue sweater because you don’t have any red sweaters in stock. [Laughs.] “We also have to educate them on what ‘counterfeit’ means. We have to literally tell them that you can’t just put an Apple logo on something and sell it, that that’s wrong. Some genuinely don’t know that. They’re like, ‘It’s my factory, I can do what I want.’ “I think there are more engineers on the platform team, working with merchants, than there are on the consumer-facing product team [because it’s] more important to educate and work with the merchants to create a win-win situation.” On how the company has managed to see so much traction: “Two years ago, the merchants were like, ‘I’ll try this. I don’t know what the hell it is, but I hear other merchants are making money, so I’ll give it a shot.’ And if you tell them, ‘Hey, if you take this inventory and put it in the U.S. or Germany or Spain, you’ll make more money,’ they’re like, ‘No. You’re the fifth thing on my mind. There’s Amazon, Taobao, my own e-commerce site.’ But after you have two or three years of these merchants getting meaningful revenue and sales and it’s growing month over month, then you get their buy-in. Then it’s, ‘Okay, now you’re the third thing on my mind.’ Then, ‘Now you’re the second.’ ‘Now, you’re the first or second; how can I get more sales?’” Pictured above: Hans Tung, a managing director at GGV Capital and board member at Wish, and Wish cofounder and CEO Peter Szulczewski. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Wish Founded 2011 Overview Wish is the leading mobile commerce platform in North America and Europe.

During 1978 and 1979, while looking to supplement their income, Rodham engaged in the trading of cattle futures contracts; an initial $1,000 investment generated nearly $100,000. She was also on the corporate board of Wal-Mart, Lafarge and TCBY (The Country’s Best Yoghurt) – all Arkansas-based companies and clients of Rose Law where Hillary was a partner.   Controversies began with her involvement in Whitewater Development Corp.  When the scandal broke out during the presidential campaign in 1992 and she was subpoenaed to produce her legal billing records; she said she did not know where they were.  Two years later, they were found in the First Lady’s Book Room.    Hillary does hold many ‘firsts’ as First Lady, including the first First Lady to be subpoenaed to appear before a federal grand jury.  However, it all simmered down to "insufficient evidence of criminal wrongdoing".  Another scandal that surfaced at this time was the Gennifer Flowers affair and Hillary’s "Stand By Your Man" reference.  The Monica Lewinski scandal generated more publicity however.  Bill Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives and this was overturned by the Senate.  Scandal seemed to follow her on a regular basis.  In 1993, it was Travelgate – financial irregularities in White House Travel Office operations.  The Teflon coating resulted in a report that she "made ‘factually false’ statements but insufficient evidence that she knew these statements were false".  In July that year, Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster reportedly committed suicide.  Allegations were made that Hillary/Bill ordered the removal of potentially damaging files relating to Whitewater and others.  In March 1994, newspapers revealed spectacular profits from her 1978/79 cattle trading futures.  No formal investigation or charges followed.  In June 1996 and it was Filegate – improper White House access to hundreds of FBI background reports on Republican White House employees.  This fizzled out as there was "no substantial or credible evidence".  After they left the White House, there were reports that gifts made to the White House were shipped to their residence.   When pressure mounted, they returned $134,000 worth of such gifts. After 9/11, she strongly supported military action in Afghanistan.  In October 2002, she voted in favour of George Bush’s Iraq War Resolution.  By 2014/15, she fully reversed herself saying she had "got it wrong" and her vote on the resolution was a "mistake".  Her campaign for re-election to the Senate from New York spent some $ 35 million – more than any other candidate for 2006 Senate elections.  Her campaign for 2008 Democratic nominee for the presidential race was a neck and neck battle with Obama for funds and votes, until she and Bill made remarks about Martin Luther King and Lyndon B Johnson that were perceived by many to be racially oriented.  Democratic voters became polarized and Obama took South Carolina with a 2 to 1 majority, or what we locally refer to a two-thirds majority.  The rest is history. There is no denying that Hillary Clinton worked hard during her tenure in the Senate and as Secretary of State, especially to promote and protect women’s and children’s rights and welfare.  After 9/11, as Senator for New York, she was instrumental in getting $21 billion funding for the World Trade Center’s redevelopment.  In an address to the UN Human Rights Council in December 2011, Hillary claimed that "Gay Rights are Human Rights".  In September 1995, she made a speech at the Fourth World conference on Women in Bejing, stating "It is no longer acceptable to discuss women’s rights as separate from human rights".  Delegates from over 180 countries heard her say, "if there is one message that echoes from this conference, let it be that human rights are women’s rights and women’s rights are human rights once and for all".  She also presented Russian (interim) President Medvedev with the ‘Reset Button’ although relations worsened when Putin returned to the presidency.  Then again there is the ‘Arab Spring’ where she controversially supporting some regimes and propped up protesters in other instances.  Egypt overthrew Hosni Mubarak;  Libya ended up as a failed state and Syria is still in turmoil.  Iraq was an inherited legacy and the pull out of US troops created a vacuum that IS filled.  The attack on the US Embassy in Benghazi (Libya) that resulted in the death of the US Ambassador and three others still haunts her.  Donald Trump’s ‘hot topic’ with Hillary is the 33,000 e-mails.  This controversy arose in March 2015 when it was revealed that Hillary maintained private e-mail accounts from a non-government private server instead of using the government services while serving as Secretary of State.  After much hue and cry the FBI would recommend to the Justice Department that "no charges are appropriate in this case" and the Attorney General declares that the "case will be closed without criminal charges".  Between 2007 and 2014, the Clintons earned almost $141 million on speaking and other engagements, mostly with Wall Street firms and business conventions.  Several organizations have tried to measure Hillary’s political spectrum analytically.  Some rate her as "one of the most liberal members during her time in the Senate".  Her economic policy is ‘inclusive capitalism’ as against Trump’s ‘trickle down economics’.  If you’re going for the ‘establishment’, or the known devil, vote for Hillary.  My sister and many of my friends in the US won’t.  That’s democracy – or a demonstration or craziness in politics.  Coming up next – TRUMPETING DONALD    Hits: 581     Send to Friend               Breaking News Await Breaking News Last Updated Nov 14 2016 | 10:17 pm ...   Featured News Amaradeva - the immortal musical... 2016-11-14 Read More   Rangana Herath – another... 2016-11-14 Read More   Support of people cannot be taken... 2016-11-14 Read More         ARCHIVES RELATED LINKS Tuesday, 15th November 2016 [Current Issue] Monday, 14th November 2016 Sunday, 13th November 2016 Saturday, 12th November 2016 Friday, 11th November 2016 Thursday, 10th November 2016 Wednesday, 9th November 2016 More Archives World Clock Currency Rates Weather     UPALI NEWSPAPERS (PVT) LTD Copyright © Upali Newspapers (Pvt) Ltd.

(Jeff Siner | The Charlotte Observer) CHARLOTTE, NC (WBTV) - If Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump carries North Carolina in what could be a squeaker, it’ll be because of people like Gary Dillon. A 54-year-old operator at a chemical company, Dillon says he hasn’t voted “in a long time.” But this year, he’s eager to go to the polls to try to send businessman Trump to the White House. “He’s not a politician, so maybe he can get something done. Like bring jobs back. American jobs,” Dillon says as he fills up his Ford pickup at the A&L Mini Mart. “I grew up in textiles and I hated to see them go in the ’90s. We need to get the economy back.” Dillon’s anxiety about the loss of factory jobs in small-town North Carolina – and his hope that Trump can reverse that decades-old trend – was echoed again and again last week in this Rowan County town 40 miles northeast of Charlotte. Other people interviewed in Faith also seconded Dillon’s low opinion of Trump’s Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. Prior to Friday’s announcement that the FBI would review newly discovered emails in the Clinton server investigation, Dillon called her a politician who “keeps getting away with lies.” In the battle for North Carolina’s 15 electoral votes, the Trump campaign is counting on places like Faith, home to 815 people, three churches, a soda shop on Main Street and a July 4 celebration that goes on for five days and attracts more than 40,000 people. The town, which stretches 1 square mile, is also predominantly white – more than 95 percent, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. During the town’s annual July 4 parade, which mostly salutes patriotism and the American flag, some have hoisted Confederate flags to honor what they call their Southern heritage. The Trump-Clinton race in North Carolina may be the fiercest and closest in the country. A new Public Policy Polling survey commissioned by the Observer found that, just over a week before Election Day, the two candidates are virtually tied in the state, with Clinton getting 46 percent of the vote and Trump 44 percent – a gap well within the margin of error. What makes North Carolina so key is that Trump likely can’t get to 270 electoral voters without it. No Republican has won the White House without the state in his column in 60 years. Both sides know the stakes, so there have been frequent visits to North Carolina by Trump and Clinton as well as their running mates and surrogate campaigners. Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence was in Smithfield on Friday and in Jacksonville on Saturday. All the key Democrats are scheduled to visit North Carolina this week, including President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton and running mate Tim Kaine and former President Bill Clinton. Trump supporter Brian Brown has a Hillary for Prison 2016 sign in his yard Hillary Clinton is strongest in Charlotte and other North Carolina cities, and needs a big turnout from the state’s African-American population. Trump is expected to do best with white voters and in small towns and rural areas. In Faith, for example, 63 percent of the 380 active registered voters are Republican. Only 14 percent are registered Democrats. The rest are unaffiliated. People around Faith are quick to admit that they cringe at some of the things that come out of Trump’s mouth, but they say that the candidate’s now-famous slogan speaks to them. A short hike from A&L Mini Mart is MC, short for Melton’s Cycle. Inside, owner Lenny Melton takes a break from building a custom wheel to answer the question: What does “Make America Great Again” mean to you? “It means, ‘Bring back manufacturing, bring Made in America back,’ ” says Melton, 39, who plans to vote for Trump. “You ride through every mill town from here back to Charlotte – you’ll see what we’ve lost. There’s nothing here. Nothing. Unless you want to work at Walmart, Taco Bell, Kohl’s, IHOP. There’s no (other) place to work.” Since 1994, North Carolina has lost more than 369,000 manufacturing jobs. It’s not hard to find “Trump/Pence” signs in Faith – in yards, and even at some mom-n-pop shops. The Faith Radio & TV Company on Main Street, which is only open on Fridays and Saturdays, displays one, along with a sign in a picture window that reads “God Bless America. Pray.” But put up a Clinton sign – or what some may think is a Clinton sign – and you could incur the wrath of neighbors in this conservative Republican town. Trump backer Brian Brown, 44, who formerly worked in manufacturing for Corning Inc., spent $10 at a yard sale for what looked like a Clinton for President sign. On closer inspection, it actually read “Hillary for Prison 2016.” After he put it up in front of his house in Faith, “one of my neighbors yelled across the yard at me,” reports Brown. “He said, ‘What in the hell is that in your yard?’ And I told him, ‘You read the whole thing?’ Then (the neighbor’s) girlfriend came out and said to him, ‘You need to get out here and read the whole thing.’ “He thought I was pro-Hillary.” ‘Time for a change’ It’s lunchtime and the Faith Soda Shop & Restaurant is filling up with locals and with patrons who’ve driven in from nearby cities and towns. Today’s special – country fried steak, mashed potatoes, and Crowder peas. Sitting near framed photos of President George H.W. Bush attending Faith’s 1992 July 4 celebration are Republicans Leonard and Carol Robbins. They run a cleaning service just outside Faith, in China Grove. And they are “most definitely” voting for Trump, says Leonard, 72. For Carol, 69, it’s both a vote for Trump and against Clinton, especially her support for abortion rights. “I am against abortion,” says Carol, who attends Life Church in Salisbury. “That’s murder, in my opinion.” But Carol also likes Trump: “He’s a straight shooter.” For Leonard, the top issues include high taxes and the Affordable Care Act – both are killing small businesses, he says, and Trump has vowed to lower taxes and repeal Obamacare. Leonard says he was also heartened to hear Trump recently call for a constitutional amendment that would place term limits on all members of Congress. “We need new blood. It’s time for a change,” he says. “Trump represents change. He’s not a politician. You can tell by the way he talks – he puts his foot in his mouth. But he’s got some great ideas.” Enjoying chili hot dogs at a table near the entrance are Amber Beaver, 20, and husband Anthony, 24. They’ve driven in from Kannapolis to have lunch at the soda shop – one of her favorite restaurants. Also with them: Their 4-month old son, Aiden. Many voters their age wanted Democrat Bernie Sanders to be the next president. But Amber and Anthony say they’re solid Trump supporters. They like his promise to get tougher on illegal immigration. And they hope, if he’s elected, that he’ll bring more and better job opportunities to small-town North Carolina. “The economy has just crashed; it’s terrible. There are no jobs,” says Anthony, who feels like he is competing for work with undocumented immigrants. “They work under the table for less money while we’re out here trying to find jobs.” Anthony went to trade school – Nashville Auto-diesel College in Tennessee – and wants to someday own his own car lot. His job now is fixing garage doors. Amber, who graduated from a beauty college, serves food at a Sonic restaurant. She’s planning to go back to school to become an elementary school teacher. Next week, she’ll be casting her first-ever vote for president. She likes Trump partly because “he’s not Hillary. ... In one interview, she says one thing. And then in her next interview, she contradicts herself.” Does it bother her that so many women have come forward to say Trump forced himself on them? No, she says, because she’s not convinced the women are telling the truth. And she thinks they may have taken money “to make (Trump) look bad.” Settled in a booth at the soda shop-restaurant with three of his employees is Richard Gould, 42, who owns a painting company based in Salisbury. He and his crew are in Faith to paint a house. He says he disagrees with Trump’s hard line on immigration – some of Gould’s employees are immigrants– and “sometimes I wish (Trump) would just not talk” because of some of the things he says or the way he says them. Still, Gould, who’s registered unaffiliated, says he’ll vote for Trump this year. “People say they want a change. Well, he’s change,” says Gould. “I don’t believe (Clinton) is going to do anything different than what’s been done before.” Hoping for change in 2008, Gould voted for Obama. He didn’t feel like he got it, so he voted for Republican Mitt Romney in 2012. Now he hopes a President Trump will do more to help small businesses and the middle class – both under siege, he says. “I think, somewhere deep down,” Gould says, “(Trump) really believes he wants to help.” ‘Made in America’ It was 1970 and Richard Nixon was president when Tom Jones started cutting hair on Main Street in Faith. He’s still at it, 46 years later. And if he has his way, Trump, not Clinton, will become the ninth president in office during his tenure at Tom’s Hairport. In fact, Jones, now 71, has already voted for Trump by absentee ballot. “He’s right about getting the businesses back in our country,” said Jones, a Republican. “I think that’s great. We’ve been downhill the way we’re going. Our businesses are leaving. ... He’s got a big mouth, but I think he’s doing good.” Jones, who served in Vietnam in 1967-68, says he wants to see “Made in America” on clothes and other products again. “I went to buy a shirt one time and it said ‘Made in Vietnam,’ ” he says. “I thought it looked good, but I threw it on the floor.” But what about the line of Trump clothes – including ties, suits and dress shirts – made in places like China, Bangladesh, Mexico and Vietnam? “I’ve heard that he’s invested overseas. But he says he’s going to bring all those businesses back,” says Jones. “Now, they can tell you anything. You don’t know if they’ll do it. ... But I don’t have much use for Hillary. And you’ve got to trust somebody.” A few doors down, on Main Street, Lenny Melton, the owner of the bicycle shop, also defends Trump, though he would have preferred Ben Carson as the GOP presidential nominee. On Trump not paying federal taxes: He was only following the law. Blame those in power who didn’t change the tax code. On Trump talking lewd about women on that “Access Hollywood” tape: “He’s not running to be the pope.” What’s more important to Melton and others in Faith is that they think Trump is the best bet to revitalize the economy in the many small towns dotting the Piedmont. “My dad’s a truck driver. He’s pulled mobile homes all his life,” Melton says. “Albemarle, Richfield, the next towns down (U.S. Route) 52 – at one point, they had over a hundred mobile home plants. They’re down to about five.” As for his own cycle business, Melton says more than 80 percent of it is now online. Walk-in traffic? “There is none. There’s no money around here,” he says. “When people walk in and see a $400 bike, that’s just something that’s out of their range.” Pilgrimage site Brian Brown’s “Hillary for Prison 2016” sign has disappeared. After two-plus weeks in his front yard, someone took it. “Either they) didn’t like it or they needed it worse than I did,” Brown says. From his porch, he recounts how his front yard became a sort of pro-Trump pilgrimage site in Faith when the sign still stood. The day after he put it up, “you wouldn’t believe the people that were stopping by and taking pictures of it on their cellphones,” says Brown. “They were posting it to their Facebook and everything.” Brown has been gung-ho on Trump from the start, voting for him over a dozen or more other more established Republicans in the state’s GOP primary. Says Brown: “Him being a businessman, he’s not tied to politics and he can’t be bought. I think he’s the man for the little man.” STAFF WRITER GAVIN OFF CONTRIBUTED.

At a time when India’s largest e-commerce company Flipkart is in talks with US retail giant Walmart Inc to raise funds through investment, two of its existing investors — Fidelity Rutland Square Trust II and Valic Co I — have reduced the valuation of their holding in the Bengaluru-based firm by 3.2 per cent and 11.3 per cent, respectively. According to filings made with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, mutual fund investor Fidelity Rutland has marked down the price of Flipkart’s shares, which it acquired in October 2013, to $81.55 apiece as on August 31, 2016, compared with $84.29 apiece as on May 31. Another investor Valic Co I has also priced down Flipkart’s stock to $95.84 per share in its books as on August 31, against $108.04 apiece as on May 31. With these markdowns, Flipkart’s total valuation reduced to $8.7 billion against $9.0 billion as per Fidelity’s numbers, and to $10.2 billion from $11.5 billion according to Valic Co’s numbers. Incidentally both these investors had, in the previous three-month period, increased Flipkart’s valuation in their books. And while this seesaw of valuations for the e-tailer continues, operationally, too, the company is facing the chill wind of some of its top talent leaving. On October 25, Flipkart’s chief financial officer Sanjay Baweja resigned from his post. An industry observer said that Baweja was the key person at the e-commerce company responsible for raising funds, and him quitting at a time when Flipkart is in midst of bringing in more investment raises several flags.

Apart from Fidelity Rutland and Valic Co, another Flipkart investor Vanguard Group has also made a filing with the US securities regulator, it has maintained the valuation of its holding in the company during the June-August quarter. An e-mail sent to a Flipkart spokesperson seeking the company’s comments on the latest development did not elicit any response. Based on its previous valuation markdowns, sector analysts had suggested that growing concerns from investors signal a call for change in the current growth-oriented but loss-making business models of e-commerce companies. In June, Flipkart made an effort to ramp up its revenues and pare its losses by increasing the commission it charges the sellers on its marketplace by 5-6 per cent across several segments such as fashion and mobile accessories.

"It's the invasion of the black birds." It's an invasion indeed, and just in time for Halloween. Now all that's missing is some back lighting, skeletons and spider webs. Talk about creepy.

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) released its game plan to meet the needs of the tens of millions of consumers that will shop at its store, online and and in stores. Wal-Mart is looking to get ahead of the shopping rush but surprising to many, an estimated 34 million Americans already started their holiday shopping. Deploying An 'Army' Wal-Mart said in a press release that it's deploying for the first time ever an "army of Holiday Helpers" to serve customers in the checkout line. Beginning next Friday, the Holiday Helpers will help speed up the checkout process for in-store shoppers. The Holiday Helpers will be "ready with candy canes and smiles" and assist customers find the shortest line and open registers as needed. They will also be tasked with quickly grabbing items that customers forgot to pick up. Santa Clause will also play a role and will make 23,000 appearances throughout all the stores this Holiday season. Online Shopping Shoppers who prefer to make their purchases online could benefit from Wal-Mart's same-day pickup service. During the busier than usual Holiday shopping weeks, the company will add tens of thousands of items that are available for in-store pickup. To help meet the spike in demand, Wal-Mart will allocate additional staff dedicated towards in-store pickups and a Pickup Manager will oversee the process at each store for the first time ever. "I can't remember another year when I've been this excited about the merchandise we are offering customers," said Steve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer, Walmart .S. "It's not just about one category or one item. Our whole store is going to be stocked with new, exciting items from hot toys to new electronics available at the best prices. We will win the season on price, from the first weekend in November to Black Friday and Cyber Monday and through those final weeks in December." Needless to say Wal-Mart's competition isn't going to sit back. According to The Wall Street Journal, Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) is also heavily investing in Holiday initiatives to spur sales.

Japan refutes old Keynesianism... Home | EconLog | Archives | Permanent Link and Comments The AT&T and Time-Warner merger is attracting considerable attention. The idea of "convergence" between telcos and content providers has been around for quite a while. Still, the idea of "convergence" needs to be tested via the market process. Integrating production and distribution was not necessarily a no-brainer, in the world of atoms. Is the world of bits bound to be different? Robert Colville, editor of CapX, thinks it is. Colville is the author of "The Great Acceleration", a book I haven't read (yet). He wrote an interesting article, expressing a sort of concern with market consolidation: In industry after industry, the market is narrowing down to three or four big incumbents, in a wave of mergers and buyouts. And when these giants confront each other, the earth quakes - or at least Marmite disappears from the shelves. Size isn't by itself a bad thing. It's economies of scale that have enabled Tesco and Wal-Mart to feed us extraordinarily cheaply - or IKEA to cut the inflation-adjusted price of its signature Poang chair from $300 to $129 between 1990 and today. But the problem is that there's another reason firms become larger - to increase their leverage over their customers. As Adam Smith said, "People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices." There are a number of Smith's quotes that are misused, but this one beats them all. What follows, in The Wealth of Nations, would put it in a rather different light: It is impossible indeed to prevent such meetings, by any law which either could be executed, or would be consistent with liberty and justice. But though the law cannot hinder people of the same trade from sometimes assembling together, it ought to do nothing to facilitate such assemblies; much less to render them necessary. A regulation which obliges all those of the same trade in a particular town to enter their names and places of abode in a public register, facilitates such assemblies. . . . A regulation which enables those of the same trade to tax themselves in order to provide for their poor, their sick, their widows, and orphans, by giving them a common interest to manage, renders such assemblies necessary. An incorporation not only renders them necessary, but makes the act of the majority binding upon the whole. Careful observer of human nature that he was, Smith pointed out that people prefer "protection" for themselves to the open sea of competition whenever possible. And yet he seemed to maintain that, if collusion was a natural tendency, there was little point in attempting to prohibit meetings that were nonetheless bound to happen. On the other hand, the government ought not to make them more profitable, so to say, by regulation and laws making monopolisation easier, if not inevitable. Getting back to Colville's article...Is there an evident and uncontested tendency toward bigger businesses in the world we live in? Sociologist Richard Bachmann thinks so and maintains the next US President should pursue a muscular antitrust policy. Mergers within big companies are certainly particularly visible. But we can observe different trends too. For example, some purported Internet "giants" are actually "platforms", which create markets for smaller suppliers or self-employed people. On top of that, in things like pharmaceuticals and biotech, my impression is that very often innovation happens in smaller firms, which sometimes end up being bought by bigger ones: which appear to be good places to scale innovation up, but not necessarily to generate it. As a matter of fact, when it comes to integrating production and distribution--the examples of "good bignesses"--Colville cites follow different business models: IKEA sells its furniture through its shop and the web, Tesco and WalMart focus on logistics and marketing of other companies' products. One of the companies that could be "squeezed" by the AT&T and Time-Warner merger, Netflix, is apparently not very worried. What keeps markets fertile and sparkling is this "biodiversity" of business models. Sure it needs free entry to be preserved. But whether we should be worried by size qua size, is still an open question. Comments and Sharing CATEGORIES: Competition EMAIL COMMENTS (2 to date) Latest Comment Harold Cockerill writes: More antitrust enforcement could get twisted to actually protect the big guys (lot of money spent on K street for that). Large businesses have an advantage in dealing with an administrative regime that works to hold back start ups. Big businesses in general are not agile which should make them vulnerable to competition from smaller companies but with the growth of the administrative state we've seen a decrease in new business formation. Big business doesn't want that to change. Too many people want protection both in business and in their personal lives. Government can give short term security but that comes with the loss of long term opportunity. The free market is not so good at short term security but nothing is better for long term opportunity. More government interference in the economy ensures the loss of opportunity and in the absence of a successful movement to make government smaller that's what the future holds for America. Posted October 29, 2016 10:04 AM David R. Henderson writes: Good post, Alberto. Also, in the Industrial Organization literature, there is good reasoning that vertical integration does not typically increase monopoly power, but, on the contrary, can reduce the distortion from successive monopoly.

Credit: Getty Images Eleanor Muffitt 29 October 2016 • 12:00pm Black Friday, the biggest shopping day of the year, has come around once again with retailers gearing up to slash prices to kick-start the Christmas gift-buying season. Last year Asda, owned by Black Friday stalwart Walmart since 1999, called off its Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers, saying it would rather focus on a prolonged series of sales in the run-up to the holiday season.  But will the supermarket have a change of heart this year? Some of you are hopeful... Asda better be taking part in Black Friday properly this year— Enzo Amore (@DarrylPdtKid) 20 September 2016 Rollback . . . to 2015 The shopping giant, which has 525 stores across the UK, is credited with helping to bring the event to the UK in 2013. In 2015, it announced it would not be part of Black Friday due to “shopper fatigue”. The store said customer feedback was behind its decision to invest in £26 million of savings for consumers across the season rather than a one-off day of sales. However, some speculated that its refusal to take part had something to do with the scenes of chaos that were filmed in their branches in 2014. Remember this? Asda Black Friday madness as frantic shoppers fight over TVs Play! 01:13 Can you still pocket the difference? The jury’s still out on whether the supermarket chain will be offering reductions on Black Friday and Cyber Monday this year, but if it does, expect slashed prices on the usual furniture, homeware, tech, toys and electrical goods. Last year, Asda offered non-Black Friday deals in store and online from the beginning of November through to Christmas and the New Year. These included half-price toy sales and deals on skincare, fragrance and gifting with Asda's 3 for £10 offer. There were also deals on consoles and televisions and other electrical items such as the Oral B 2500 which was down to £29.97 from £75.00. So even if the shop doesn't take part in Black Friday in 2016, there will still be savings to be had. Phew! ​ The Asda bottom 'pocket tap' adverts return Play! 00:44 Knowledge is power The key to Black Friday success is staying ahead of the game - so if Asda does decide to get in on the action, you’ll want to be the first to know. To bag the best potential deals, follow Asda’s Facebook and Twitter pages for updates, and sign up to store emails.  If you’re happier shopping in-store than online, note down when your local Asda opens and closes so you can avoid any crowds during peak times. Plus, find out more about all the deals out there by heading to our other Black Friday pages - where we've laid out all the best offers for you - and our Telegraph Promotions Facebook and Twitter accounts. Did you know? The adoption of the Asda name occurred in 1965 with the merger of the Asquith chain of three supermarkets and Associated Dairies. Asda is an abbreviation of Asquith and Dairies.

Emily Drooby (@EmilyDrooby) has a list of this year's oddest sexy costumes. Buzz60 Halloween is on Monday this year and is quickly approaching. (Photo: Mary Altaffer, AP) Halloween spending is expected to reach $8.4 billion this year in the U.S., according to the National Retail Federation’s annual holiday survey. That’s the highest in the survey’s 11-year history. With U.S. consumers expected to spend $82.93 on average, shoppers preparing for a scary good time will be looking for bargains. Here’s where to find deals on costumes, candy and other goodies. Budget bags of candy Bags of candy can add up, especially if you’re expecting a frightening number of trick-or-treaters. Warehouse stores such as Costco, Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club offer a sweet alternative because they sell Halloween candy in bulk at lower cost per unit. For instance, a six-count of full-size, 1.55-ounce Hershey’s chocolate bars costs $4.48 at discount giant Wal-Mart (approximately 75 cents per bar), while a 36-pack of full-size candy bars sells for $20.49 at Sam’s Club (approximately 57 cents per bar). Cheap costumes Costumes are plentiful and affordable at Walmart, where a kit to turn yourself into a human emoticon costs $10. Walmart customers can buy almost any of the company’s in-store Halloween merchandise online for pickup at a store while items are available. Kmart.com has over 5,000 different costumes for sale — some up to 50% off — but the retailer is offering an additional incentive to shop in store. On Oct. 29, Freebie Saturday, children 12 and younger can walk away with a free Halloween pail. If you’re looking for a last-minute costume but don’t want to fight crowds of procrastinators, sign up for the email newsletter at HalloweenCostumes.com. It will unlock shipping offers at the costume store, including Saturday delivery from $14.99 (regularly from $34.99) when ordering Oct. 27-28, or Monday delivery from $14.99 when ordering Oct. 28-29. Discounted decorations Dressing yourself is only half the battle. Discounted decorations for your home are abundant in the countdown to Oct. 31, if you know where to look. Select harvest decor is 50% off throughout October at Joss & Main. These decorations will last you through Halloween and Thanksgiving. Jet.com has deals on indoor and outdoor decor. Plus, if you’ve never shopped at Jet.com, you get 15% off your first three orders with code TRIPLE15. Some exclusions apply, and your order must be a minimum of $35. At Target, shoppers who spend at least $30 on Halloween products can save $5 online and in store through Oct. 29. And don’t forget about Dollar Tree. Glow-in-the-dark lawn signs, party supplies, drawstring bags and more are $1 each. Selection may vary by store. Creature features Finally, if you want to deck out your animal friends for the holiday, PetSmart could have what you’re looking for. Here, all Halloween costumes and select Halloween-themed toys are 40% to 70% off. This sale lasts through the holiday. The Oct. 31 holiday, which falls on Monday this year, is rapidly approaching. If you plan to shop online, select an expedited shipping speed to get your tricks and treats in time. Otherwise, skip shipping costs altogether and head to the store.

If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen West Kelowna, B.C. – RCMP are asking for the public’s help locating a wheelchair they believe two men stole Wednesday at Walmart. Surveillance footage shows a man swapping out his wheelchair for a motorized shopping cart at the West Kelowna store’s east entrance. A second suspect is seen accompanying him as the man heads into the store operating the cart. As the pair leave at the west exit, the second man wheels the first out in someone else’s wheelchair parked at the door. The first suspect was wearing a plaid jacket, black toque and blue jeans. The second suspect had a full goatee and was wearing a tan coat with hood, black shirt, blue jeans and white shoes. “In reviewing the video surveillance footage, it appears as though the suspect knowingly left the store in someone else’s mobility aid device while leaving his own behind,” Cpl. Jesse O’Donaghey said. RCMP said there is also a possibility it was a mistake. Anyone with information is asked to contact West Kelowna RCMP at 250-768-2880 or by leaving a tip with Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477. © 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

 Amazon is about to become the biggest clothing retailer in the US Hayley Peterson Oct. 25, 2016, 12:14 PM 15,248 facebook linkedin twitter email print An ad for Amazon Fashion. Facebook/Amazon Fashion Amazon is expected to surpass Macy's to become the biggest apparel seller in the US next year, according to a new 58-page report from Cowen & Co. The shift would represent a huge shake-up for the apparel industry, which has long been dominated by department stores like Macy's, Nordstrom, and JCPenney, as well as big-box retailers including Walmart and Target. Amazon is a relative newcomer to the fashion world, and it has made a swift rise to the top. The company's clothing and accessory sales are expected to grow nearly 30% next year, to $28 billion, according to the Cowen analysts. Macy's apparel sales, by comparison, are expected to drop 4%, to $22 billion, in the period. As Amazon's sales grow, so will its share of the apparel market in the US. Amazon currently claims about 6.6% of the market. That share is expected to increase to 8.2% by next year and further expand to 16.2% within five years, according to Cowen analysts. By 2021, Cowen expects Amazon to generate $62 billion in annual apparel sales. TJ Maxx is expected to be the No. 2 clothing seller, with $26 billion in sales, and Macy's is expected to claim the No. 3 spot, with $23 billion in sales. Over the past couple of years, Amazon has ramped up its investment in fashion by launching its own private-label clothing brands and sponsoring the first New York men's fashion week. Macy's is losing market share to Amazon. David Ramos/Getty Images The company has also hired executives from luxury fashion companies, such as Julie Gilhart, the Barneys New York fashion director whom Amazon reportedly hired as a consultant, and Vogue editor Caroline Palmer. Also in the past few years, Amazon has started to shift its fashion strategy toward offering more high-end designer names such as Zac Posen and Stuart Weitzman. That shift has had some industry experts scratching their heads. Luxury fashion websites are typically well merchandised and highly curated — not things for which Amazon is necessarily known. Amazon's weaknesses with curation were highlighted in a shopper survey conducted in July by Cowen & Co. "Amazon Fashion got a very lukewarm review for site personalization and ease of use," Cowen analyst John Kernan said in a conference call on Tuesday. Shoppers said it "wasn't particularly easy to browse." Amazon also has the disadvantage of having no brick-and-mortar stores where shoppers can try on items or return purchases, he said. So why do people choose to shop on Amazon for clothes? Amazon Prime is the biggest lure for customers, according to Cowen & Co. Shoppers cited the convenience and free two-day shipping as the biggest advantage of shopping for clothes on Amazon. They also praised Amazon's customer service and breadth of product reviews.

OKLAHOMA CITY - At 18-years-old Meagan Gaddis was addicted to drugs. “Anything,” Gaddis said. “Marijuana, ecstasy, cocaine, alcohol, opiates…” Now 29, she spent her college years on the street, ultimately addicted to meth. Her life had become a revolving door between the needle and the jail cell. “The only thing that I knew, that was familiar to me was to get arrested I took a check that was made out to somebody else and I took it to Walmart and I signed my name to the back of it and I said could you call the cops because I'm trying to go to prison,” Gaddis said. But she didn't go to prison, instead she was able to get treatment because of a plan only offered in Oklahoma County to single mothers, and it's the reason why she's support state questions 780 and 781. The questions are joined together. State question 780 reduces several felony drug crimes to misdemeanors. State question 781, which can only pass if 780 does, sets up rehab and job training programs designed to get drug users out of prison and back into the workforce. But law enforcement officials say it will make their jobs harder and potentially put more drugs and drug dealers back on the streets. “Just because there's a problem, the first person to stand up and say here's a solution doesn't make it the right solution,” Fraternal Order of Police Vice President Mark Nelson said in a previous interview. 10/21/16 Related Story: Oklahoma Police Officers Voice Opposition To SQ 780, 781 But Meagan disagrees. “We can be smart on crime instead of tough on crime and then we can start changing things that need to be changed.” NewsMore>> Class Sizes Are Growing Faster Than Teaching Positions Class Sizes Are Growing Faster Than Teaching Positions [File Photo] As State Schools Superintendent Joy Hofmeister holds town hall meetings across the state, she is likely to get questions about the state's continuing teacher shortage and the impact it is having on class sizes.

Bethania Palma Oct 28, 2016 Share - - In September 2016, Wilma Price was driving through a Walmart parking lot in Huntsville, Texas, when she spotted a homeless man named Patrick holding a sign that said, "Dog in pound. Need help." Price, who runs a rescue called Mr. K's Pet Shelter, stopped to help. She said Patrick had been arrested for trespassing and taken to Walker County Jail in Huntsville. His dog, Franklin, had been taken away to the Rita B. Huff shelter in Walker County, where he was listed as a stray. Price took him to the shelter where she paid $120 to get his dog back. The two have since formed a tight friendship, and Price is fundraising to help Patrick get back on his feet. The story proved to be an irresistible bit of happy news amid a dark and nasty presidential election cycle, and after telling it to a dog web site and CBS News, it spread far across the Internet. In a bizarre and confusing twist, a web site called the Alabama Observer (which generally seems to post legitimate news items) published the same story — but with the location changed to Huntsville, Alabama (not Texas). The names of the people involved were also changed in the Observer story, which does not carry a byline.  In that version, the homeless man's name is changed to Mark Spencer and the dog's name is changed to Wilbur, and the woman who comes to their aid is Elizabeth Masterson, 29. (Price said Patrick's last name is phonetically pronounced "Balisky," but she doesn't know the spelling). Price told us that the publication also took a picture of Patrick holding Franklin that has been published with their story, but reversed it. She said no one has responded to requests to remove the erroneous information. There are so many [versions of the story] going that honestly I haven't had time to keep up with it. I'm aware of [The Alabama Observer] one, and there was a couple other ones. I’m shocked that it went as it has. I don’t feel like I did anything that anyone else wouldn’t do. There is no contact information on the Observer's web site, but a rather lengthy and unusual "Terms" page makes it appear that the content on the site is submitted by various users, as opposed to typical news organizations that hire reporters and freelancers to file stories, which are then vetted and edited before publication. Price said a stranger started fundraising for Patrick and they had to get the page removed from GoFundMe (Price has herself started a fund for Patrick, which has raised thousands of dollars). Price said Patrick has been helping her with animal rescue efforts since the two met, and her Facebook page documents their adventures together: Originally published: 28 October 2016 Tags: dogs alabama observer animal rescue Bethania Palma Bethania Palma Markus is a journalist from the Los Angeles area who has covered everything from city hall to crime to national politics.

Markdowns by investors, constant struggle to retain leadership in the market thanks to fierce competition from an aggressive Amazon and failure to retain top talent internally—India’s largest ecommerce firm has been facing its demons. To add it to woes, Bengaluru-based Flipkart’s chief financial officer Sanjay Baweja quit amid the festive season, which is a crucial period for ecommerce companies. In a chat with Techcircle, Baweja speaks about the reasons behind his decision to quit the ecommerce major, Flipkart’s financial position and much more. Edited excerpts: Are you satisfied with Flipkart’s financial performance? It was something that I thoroughly enjoyed. As a team, we have really expanded. Because the focus has been on acquiring customers, we have innovated all across. Be it low-cost EMIs or product exchanges, all that was because we were customer centric. Everything else took a back seat and ruthless execution helped in a big way. I am really proud to have been part of this. Financially, we are much better than what we were. We have a substantial amount of cash and a very strong run rate. Secondly, from a financial profitability (angle), if you look at numbers six months ago and now, there has been a substantial positive move. These two years have been great in terms of value and volume growth, profitability improvement and overall cash availability. Was resignation a tough decision for you? All decisions where you leave things are not easy. I am a relationship guy. Therefore, there is the pain of leaving behind your people. There have been media reports of an impending investment by Walmart in Flipkart and Flipkart seems to be in the middle of a fundraise. Also, this is the festive season which is important for ecommerce companies. Why exit at this point? There is no absolute aggressive fundraise programme. As of now, we are not doing anything. Like I said, there is enough runway available. Funds are available for more than two years. That is one aspect. But yes, one or two transactions will continue to happen. If there are investors who want to talk to us, whether strategic or financial, we will continue those (talks). But are we aggressively pursuing or running a process? That is not true. Doesn’t your exit during the festive season affect Flipkart’s focus? Some activity will be happening always. In that sense, there will be no right time. One has to make a view and move on. What was the reason behind your decision to move on? I have built a team and made a lot of changes. Something else came up and I thought let me try that. You had come from a conglomerate to a startup. Do you think it was a mistake? Not at all. I enjoyed the journey. There was a lot of learning and I personally believe that I have added a lot of value to Flipkart. A startup needs a lot of processes; we were able to do a lot of that. I don’t think I regret it. How do you see Sachin and Binny Bansal’s leadership? They are great entrepreneurs. They are the ones who initiated the whole thing. They will take the firm to much greater heights. One can move forward only if the leadership is great. Both have distinct styles. They will move forward in a big way. How has been the competition with Amazon over the past two years? For them, India is one of the biggest markets left, as they could not do much in China. They are very aggressive. But we have been maintaining our lead. We have done really well. October was a substantial month for us. We are an Indian (company); there is an Indian-ness about us and we will continue to lead the way. Yes, they have global processes, but we understand the Indian psyche better. There have been a couple of investor markdowns in the past. How have the markdowns affected Flipkart? Valuation markdowns were done by some investors due to other compulsions in terms of market realities. I don’t think it has impacted us. Someone is coming up with a mathematical exercise for internal calculation without even elaborating—a number doesn’t matter. There was also a media report which said Flipkart was in talks with Amazon for a sell-out. Is that true? No. This is a figment of imagination from your fraternity. There has never been such a thing. There were layoffs at Flipkart in the past. Were those measures driven by concerns with regards to profitability? I don’t think there were any layoffs like that. Those were normal attrition and (related to) performance issues. Do you think Flipkart has made any mistakes in terms of decision-making or organisational restructuring? Every startup continues to learn and define the way it operates. It is a continuous process. An allegation of fraud against you has been making the rounds in social media. Have you seen it? I have seen it. It came out of nowhere. We have always followed a well-regulated process. Where are you moving to? Are you starting up or moving to another company? I have not really thought about it. I am unlikely to be in the startup world. Will you be taking a break before joining the new place? I have never taken a break. There is also an offer in air. Any regrets? These are exciting times. But there are other things to be done also. For instance, I have been away from my family. There are no real regrets. There are other opportunities that I am wanting to pursue. Like this interview? Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our top reports.

Since this part of town has recorded several recent car burglaries, Alvarez deemed it prudent to conduct a field inquiry. Police said Oliver explained that he had just left a bar in Harrison and was walking home to Newark. Since Newark was in the opposite direction, Alvarez deemed it prudent to conduct a warrant check and found that Oliver was wanted by Rochelle Park for hindering apprehension ($500/full), police said. A search incident to arrest on said warrant reportedly revealed a bag of suspected marijuana in his pants pocket.  Alvarez, with Officer Victor Girdwood as backup, brought Oliver to headquarters, where the arrestee reportedly became profane and offensive and “declined to cooperate to any degree” with the booking process. When his defiance increased, police said, he was put in a holding cell, and the officers had to forcibly remove the standard accoutrements (belt, shoelaces, jewelry, etc.) of which cell-bound suspects are relieved. Later, when Det. Frank West and Officer Alan Stickno went to the cellblock to get Oliver and complete the booking, they found he had removed all his clothing and was wrapped in a blanket, his bare legs sticking out, police said. Ordered to get dressed, Oliver reportedly responded that he was aware of his rights under the Second Amendment. Eventually, he was formally charged – on the warrant and with possession of pot and drug paraphernalia – and at noon was shipped to the Hudson County Jail. (Editor’s note: Yes, we know you might like to see the mugshot, but because of the booking difficulties, Oliver’s photo apparently could not be taken until he was at the jail, so we don’t have it.)  ••• Other recent reports from the Kearny police blotter included the following: Oct. 13 Officers Luis Moran and Richard Poplaski responded to a 4 p.m. report of someone smoking a CDS in a Trinity Place backyard and reportedly found Jason Lilly, 19, of Newark, puffing away on a patio. He was arrested for possession of pot and paraphernalia. Oct. 14 At 3:15 a.m. near QuickChek, Officers Mina Ekladious and Jose Castillo observed a man discard a small plastic bag on the ground, recovered same and arrested Earl McLeod, 27, of Willingboro, on charges of possession of pot/paraphernalia. Oct. 15 At 4 a.m., police said, Officers Jason Rodrigues and Rich Pawlowski observed a 2017 Toyota – its lights on, its engine running, its gear in “drive” and its driver asleep behind the wheel – in the Seabra lot on Schuyler Ave. When they and backup Officer Sean Podolski were unable to rouse the driver, they tried to open the doors so they could turn off the ignition. At that point, police said, Andres Quiroz-Tejada, 22, of Kearny, woke up long enough to try to drive away, but the car travelled only a few feet before hitting a curb and coming to a halt. At which point, the driver fell asleep again. With the aid of Sgt. Mike O’Neill, the cops got the doors open, rendered the vehicle safe and removed the motorist, who allegedly was so intoxicated that he was “in no condition” to be given field sobriety tests. Quiroz-Tejada was brought to HQ and charged with DWI and refusing to take an Alcotest. ••• Officers Stickno, Jordenson Jean and Kyle Plaugic were called to the mall area at 200 Passaic Ave. at 3 p.m. on a report that two teenage boys on bicycles had discarded a backpack under a parked vehicle. At the sight of the patrol cars, the youths abandoned their bikes and fled on foot – one running toward BJ’s; the other, toward LA Fitness. Stickno and Jean caught the latter. Plaugic and off-duty Officer Jose Castillo, working in BJ’s, found the other in that store.  Police said the backpack, found beneath a Dodge van, had apparently been stolen from Kmart, as had its contents: four pairs of NBA socks, two T-shirts, one pair of black slippers and a handbag/fanny pack. A window on the van had been smashed with a large rock, and the vehicle’s owner reported that its interior was in disarray and that some change was missing, police said. The two 15-year-old suspects from Newark were charged with burglary, conspiracy, obstructing the administration of law and two counts each of receiving stolen property, and were released to the custody of parents/guardians.   ••• At 8 p.m., Officers Chris Medina and Michael Gontarczuk were dispatched to the Verizon store in the Walmart mall on the report of an unruly customer, identified as Carl Rutherford, 34, of Newark. According to management, he  removed a phone from a display case, setting off an alarm, became confrontational and refused to leave the premises. Police said Rutherford was found to be wanted on a $3,000 traffic warrant out of East Orange, was arrested and processed at HQ and turned over to the East Orange PD.   Oct. 16 At 3:10 p.m., an individual approached an East Orange couple sitting in a car in the Walmart lot and asked the man, who was in the passenger seat, for $1. When the request was refused, the panhandler reached through the window and attempted to snatch a chain from the man’s neck. The female driver put the car in gear, but the would-be thief, despite now being dragged, did not release his grip. Until the victim bit him on the hand. He then fell to the pavement and was last seen running into the meadow area behind the Walmart building. Officer Chris Levchak took the incident report, obtained a description of the suspect and contacted Walmart for security videos of the area. As of this writing, the perp had not yet been identified. Oct. 18 Shortly after midnight, Officers Alvarez and Darwin Paulino stopped a 2007 Pontiac that had run a red light on the Newark Turnpike and saw passenger Ali Jenkins, 19, of Newark, discard a tissue apparently containing loose marijuana, police said. The tissue was recovered and Jenkins was arrested for possession of pot/paraphernalia. The driver, a 21-year-old Jersey City woman, got a summons for the signal violation.  Oct. 19 At 10 a.m., Vice officers observed a 2015 Hyundai driven by David Conway, 46, of Lyndhurst, enter Kearny from Belleville. As he passed the unmarked police car, he became bogged down in traffic and was reportedly seen inspecting several wax folds. When the officers stopped him at the Pike and Passaic Ave., police said, they saw him stuff something into his mouth and begin to swallow, and he allegedly admitted he had ingested two folds of heroin.  Conway was arrested and brought to HQ, where Kearny EMS assessed his condition and took him to Clara Maass Medical Center for observation. He has been charged with possession of the drug and paraphernalia and with tampering with evidence. ••• Officer Gontarczuk, on patrol near Belgrove Drive and Bergen Ave. at 8:10 p.m., detected the odor of burning marijuana apparently emanating from Veterans Field, where a group of young adults had congregated. When the smoke cleared, three were under arrest. Jomar Diaz, 23, of Newark, and Kristiana Schmidt, 19, of Kearny, were each charged with possession of pot and paraphernalia. Police said Marllon Marques, 22, of Kearny, was taken into custody on two warrants: Newark, DWI, $500, and Kearny, failure to appear, $100. Oct. 20 During a 3 a.m. traffic stop at Kearny Ave. and Liberty St., Officer Jonathan Dowie reportedly detected the familiar odor and found in the center console of a 2009 Saturn a small case containing wax dabs of marijuana and a scraper used to apply these to a vaporizer. Driver Keith Henderson, 24, of Newark, was charged with possession of pot/paraphernalia, possession of a CDS in an MV, and a brake-light violation.  – Karen Zautyk Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Email Print Related News Karen Zautyk | Observer Correspondent More Posts Post navigation Previous Article← Fashion & art & Goodwill Next ArticleMonumental undertaking for Explorers → This week’s e-Edition Schuyler Savings Bank Abbott/Milano Insurance Brady, Brady & Reilly NOTICE Have you or someone you love been involved in a crash or accident involving New Jersey Transit?

REUTERS/Jonathan Drake WASHINGTON — The North Carolina couple won’t even watch the news in the same room anymore. He is voting for Donald Trump to cancel out her vote for Hillary Clinton. The tension has brought their marriage to its lowest point, she said. Recommended for you Three injured in Bayfield County snowmobile accident “I really, genuinely think the marriage is the worst it has ever been,” said Tasha, who, like the others in a Charlotte, N.C., focus group last week, gave just her first name. “It is a train wreck. I do not even want to hear it,” she said. “He has to put headphones on to listen to his Fox News. It sends me over the edge.” Asked later to name one positive attribute about Clinton, Tasha’s husband, Kyler, struggled. “There might have been something before this campaign,” he said. “But I hate her.” In most elections, married couples tend to vote alike. But this year, polls indicate that married women are spurning the Republican nominee in numbers not seen in decades. In households around the country, husbands and wives who have traditionally voted the same ticket are parting ways, creating tension — and denial. In some cases, husbands keep Democratic canvassers and mailers from getting to their wives. In other cases, they are just putting blinders on. Executives at the AFL-CIO’s door-to-door campaign, Working America, say they get regular reports of canvassers being told to get lost by men who answer the door. “We’ll knock on a door and the husband will say ‘we want nothing to do with you,’ and slam the door our face,” said Karen Nussbaum, executive director of the group. “About 20 minutes later, his wife runs out to find us and tell us, ‘He had it wrong — I agree with you.’” One canvasser in Columbus, Ohio, reported three such incidents in a week. Others talked of women married to Trump voters whispering out of earshot of their spouses that they will vote for Clinton. A recent poll suggested that many husbands are in denial or in the dark. Asked in a YouGov/Economist this month whom they think their spouses would vote for, 33 percent of married men said Clinton would get their wives’ votes. They were way off. Among married women, 45 percent said they were with her. “Many women don’t want to introduce conflict in their families over politics,” said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake. “Women just say, ‘Sure, honey,’ and then go and vote their way.” The gender gap — women are more likely to vote Democratic and men for Republicans — is real. What’s often is less understood is that the division has usually been widest with unmarried women, who side with Democratic candidates overwhelmingly. A majority of married women have not voted for a Democrat for president since Bill Clinton in 1996. Now, Hillary Clinton seems on track to get their votes. Clinton’s success may in part reflect her status as the first woman to win a major-party nomination. But it also reflects the uneasiness many female voters have with her opponent, who has been caught boasting about his unwanted sexual advances and has been accused by about a dozen women of harassment or assault. Female voters tell pollsters they are anxious about Trump’s bombast, the kind of role model he would be for their children, and the prospect of him having control of the nuclear launch codes. “I’m pretty sure there is not 100 percent truthfulness in wives talking to their husbands about who they are voting for,” said Republican pollster Neil Newhouse, an organizer of last Tuesday’s focus group in Charlotte. The focus group was part of a multiyear project sponsored by Wal-Mart to gauge the attitudes of mothers who shop at its stores, a key swing voting bloc in recent elections. But while Democrats hope that the splitting of so many households this year may start a trend, Newhouse is skeptical. This is a Trump phenomenon, he said. “It is a classic nose-holder election,” he said. “People are holding their noses and voting. There are very few people in love with their candidate.” Democratic strategists see opportunity nonetheless. “Once you vote independently of your spouse, you may end up liking it,” Lake said. Democrats have been busy fine-tuning techniques for communicating with women in households where the husband is voting Trump and may not know — or not accept — that his wife is not on board. This kind of stealth persuasion has a long history. Thirty years ago, it often involved sending personal letters that did not have the appearance of campaign mail to the woman in the house, to avoid the husband intercepting it and tossing it in the trash. Today, the messaging is more sophisticated. Email inboxes and Facebook accounts are targeted with pitches customized to the concerns female voters have expressed, and they are compounded with television advertisements that take aim at some of Trump’s behavior. The split-household phenomenon may be one factor driving the high level of tension this election is causing voters. Nearly 1 in 4 likely voters says the campaign has caused them “serious stress,” according to an ABC News tracking poll published Tuesday. A Pew Research survey released earlier this month found that 41 percent of voters who are not supporting the same candidate as their spouse have had an argument about the election.

Share story By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM The New York Times The constant flow of goods from Asia to the United States was briefly interrupted last month after Hanjin, the South Korean shipping line, filed for bankruptcy, stranding several dozen of its cargo ships on the high seas. It was a moment that made literal the stagnation of globalization. The growth of trade among nations is among the most consequential and controversial economic developments of recent decades. Yet despite the noisy debates, which have reached new heights during this presidential campaign, it is a little-noticed fact that trade is no longer rising. The volume of global trade was flat in the first quarter of 2016, then fell 0.8 percent in the second quarter, according to statisticians in the Netherlands, which happens to keep the best data.

The United States is no exception to the broader trend. The total value of U.S. imports and exports fell more than $200 billion last year. Through the first nine months of 2016, trade fell an additional $470 billion. It is the first time since World War II that trade with other nations has declined during a period of economic growth. Sluggish global economic growth is both a cause and a result of the slowdown. In better times, prosperity increased trade and trade increased prosperity. Now the wheel is turning in the opposite direction. Reduced consumption and investment are dragging on trade, which is slowing growth. But there are also signs that the slowdown is becoming structural. Developed nations appear to be backing away from globalization. The World Trade Organization’s most recent round of global trade talks ended in failure last year. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, an attempt to forge a regional agreement among Pacific Rim nations, also is foundering. It is opposed by both major-party U.S. presidential candidates. Meanwhile, new barriers are rising. Britain is leaving the European Union. The WTO said in July its members had put in place more than 2,100 new restrictions on trade since 2008. Against the tide, the European Union and Canada signed a far-reaching trade agreement Sunday that commits them to opening their markets to greater competition, after overcoming a last-minute political obstacle that reflected the growing skepticism toward globalization in much of the developed world. The benefits of globalization have accrued disproportionately to the wealthy, while the costs have fallen on displaced workers, and governments have failed to ease their pain. During the 1990s, global trade grew more than twice as fast as the economy. Europe united. China became a factory town. Tariffs came down. Transportation costs plummeted. It was the Wal-Mart Era. But those changes have played out. Europe is fraying around the edges; low tariffs and transportation costs cannot get much lower. And China is making more of what it consumes, and consuming more of what it makes. In addition, China’s maturing industrial sector increasingly makes its own parts. The International Monetary Fund reported last year that the share of imported components in products “Made in China” has fallen to 35 percent from 60 percent in the 1990s. The result: The IMF study calculated that a 1 percent increase in global growth increased trade volumes by 2.5 percent in the 1990s, while in recent years, the same growth has increased trade by just 0.7 percent. Hanjin, like other big shippers, bet global trade would continue to grow rapidly. In 2009, the world’s cargo lines had enough room to carry 12.1 million of the standardized shipping containers that have played a crucial, if quiet, role in the rise of global trade. By last year, they had room for 19.9 million, much of it unneeded. Most trade flows among developed nations. The McKinsey Global Institute calculates that 15 countries account for roughly 63 percent of the global traffic in goods and services, and for an even larger share of financial investment. Dani Rodrik, a Harvard economist, calculates that manufacturing employment in India and other developing nations has peaked, a phenomenon he calls premature deindustrialization. Infrastructure investment by multinational corporations declined for the third straight year in 2015, according to the United Nations.

It may be Halloween, but Christmas is only 55 days away, and certain businesses and organizations are definitely counting. The Edison & Ford Winter Estates in Fort Myers started stringing lights over two weeks ago. Tim Rose and James Corner were working together Friday afternoon to light up a royal palm. “We typically do this starting every October,” said Lisa Sbuttoni, director of special activities for the Estates. All the hard work is in preparation for what they call “opening night” Nov. 25, the day after Thanksgiving. Edison Ford Holiday Nights, which run through Jan. 1, will include tours, a children’s holiday tree trail and a Waltzing Waters display.

Specialty retailers such as Soma put out holiday offerings Oct. 20, with Chico’s and White House | Black Market following suit in about a week. They are just trying to get their slice of the holiday pie. Consumers plan to spend an average of $935.58 during the holiday shopping season, according to the National Retail Federation’s annual consumer spending survey conducted by Prosper Insights & Analytics. Soma has stocked stores with what Fort Myers-based Chico’s FAS calls “holiday floor sets,” according to a company official. Soma introduced new colors and styles of lingerie that tie into the company’s overall holiday color palette. Soma’s holiday collection features lacy lingerie and pajamas in new prints. Lacy bralettes and plunge styles have been added, and its top bra collections have gotten a sparkle. New panty styles include “cheekier silhouettes.” Chico’s festive offerings will feature sweaters, loungewear and jewelry. A holiday offering from White House | Black Market  (Photo: Special to The News-Press) White House | Black Market will offer dresses, embellished sweaters and artisanal bustiers. Colors will include a rich red, blues and shades of silver, as well as black and white. While this might seem early, it’s really just holiday business as usual. Big-box stores such as Wal-Mart might get the prize for early stocking. “We know many of our customers like to plan their holiday decor shopping early,” according to a Walmart statement. “Setting in late September, which is the same time we’ve begun offering holiday decor over the past several years, ensures our customers can find the items they are looking for.” Connect with this reporter: email clogan@news-press.com and follow on Twitter @caseylo THE NEWS-PRESS Chico’s future: Data in driver’s seat 72 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://newspr.es/2f20fYZ TOP VIDEOS Most touching ways soldiers reunited with their family 1:17 Hogs And Air Dogs Fly Again 1:09 Donald Trump's unlikely path to presidency 2:01 News-Press Election Update: 7pm Florida Polls Close 16:10 News-Press Election Update: 8pm Mailbag Reader Debate 16:42 News-Press Election Update: 9pm Poll Update 14:39 Boca Grande: The Harbor Pilot 2:04 Save Our Water: moderated panel 17:52 Inside SWFL Football: Week 11 6:31 Dad builds phenomenal costumes for his son 0:49 Dress for Success SWFL focused on inspiring women 1:35 'I will not give up.'

Published Oct 30th, 2016 10:48 am gjared@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas City sales and use tax receipt collections in the Jonesboro metro area were slightly higher in October than in 2015, but the trend slightly dipped as fall began. Jonesboro has collected $14.482 million in sales and use tax receipts this year, a 5% increase compared to the year before. In October, the city collected $1.4 million, a 2% increase compared to October 2015, but it dropped the yearly increase by two-tenths of a point. The October report reflects tax collected on August sales. “I can’t really see any downside to higher sales tax numbers,” Arkansas State University economics professor Chris Brown told Talk Business & Politics. “It shows the public is spending and has the ability to spend money.” City sales and use taxes are almost $500,000 more than budget expectations, a gain of 3.5%. Craighead County displayed similar trend lines. The county collected $16.102 million in county sales and use tax this year, a nearly 5.1% increase from the year before. The county is easily on pace to crush its previous annual collection record of $18.4 million set in 2015. Another primary economic indicator, employment, has shown growth this year in the metro area, Brown said. Jonesboro’s unemployment rate in August was 3.1%, nearly eight-tenths of a point lower than at the first of the year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor. More than 35,668 were employed in the city, a 3.3% increase from January. Craighead County’s unemployment rate and drop were identical to the city’s during the first eight months of the year. At least 51,016 county residents had jobs as of August, a 3.3% increase from January. Sales tax numbers and employment rates are positive, but there are still economic issues that affect the economic health of the region, Brown said. The median household income in Jonesboro in 2015 was less than $41,000 according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The median household income national average was $55,775 in 2015, a 37% disparity. Northeast Arkansas’ blend of light manufacturing, food processing, educational, agricultural, health, retail, and food service jobs insulate it from the fluctuations of the national economy, Brown said. But the lack of heavy industry, white collar, and technology jobs hurt wage growth, he said. Solving those problems could be difficult, he said. There are entire buildings in Dallas, Memphis, Chicago, and other major cities are filled with high paid administrators and others who run major corporations. These “corporate hubs” are found in places that have easy airport access and readily available college graduates, he said. A prime example in Arkansas would be the Northwest sector where Wal-Mart Stores, Tyson Foods, and other major companies are located. Arkansas ranks near the bottom among all states in the number of residents who have a college degree, and the Mississippi Delta Region, which includes Northeast Arkansas, has some of the lowest college graduate rates in the entire country, he said. Attracting a heavy industrial prospect, or landing a major technology firm would also be difficult, he said. Those companies tend to stay in or neat cities with other major businesses, he said. However, sales tax receipts continue to rise, and the unemployment rate continues to decline – two dynamics many communities around the country would love to have. “We have a very diversified economy and we need to continue to build on that,” he said.

I feel like I should be angry about video game companies hampering reviews, but I’m just not. I’m filled with boiling apathy (can apathy be boiling?) about whether video game media sites get timely reviews or not.  The movement stems from last week’s announcement by Bethesda that it won’t release copies of its upcoming games, including biggies such as “Dishonored 2” and a special remastered version of “The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim,” early to reviewers.  Early access is critical to the review process: A good, thoughtful review requires time. Most other media companies know this and work with it: TV companies often give reporters access to as many as two or four episodes of a TV show’s newest season a couple of weeks before its debut. Movie companies provide screenings of movies as early as a week out.  Given that a video game is going to require a significant time sink just to consume a reasonable portion of the product, it doesn’t seem out of line to ask for at least a week. But Bethesda is joining several other publishers in scaling back that time. In some cases, they give reporters a day. In others, none at all.  Why I’m not angry about this is a mystery.  Two video game sites I respect for their unbiased coverage certainly are. Kotaku and Polygon were not impressed in the least.  • Kotaku didn’t condemn the move, mainly because that site prefers to release reviews late, anyway. But Stephen Totilo noted exactly how the job of a game reviewer gets more difficult with this decision: “The challenge for editors and reviewers will be to allow those who need to play the game and assess it to do so without feeling rushed, to be unworried by the fact that they may still working on the review while gamers are already buying and playing the game.” • Polygon was a bit more upset. In a post with the headline “Bethesda wants your money before the reviews hit,” Ben Kuchera wrote, “This move will make reviews worse, overall. It’s possible some outlets may decide to rush through Bethesda’s games to get their review up first and soak up as much of that sweet, sweet search traffic as they can. There will be a very real business incentive to get your review up as soon as possible.”  Both writers also point out Bethesda’s hypocrisy: The company is giving select YouTubers access to games by as much as a month. The company is granting favors toward a segment that acts more as an enthusiast, willing to overlook the glitches and ease off criticism in order to show off gameplay and reveal their favored status with a game publisher.  As a journalist and as a video game fan, I know I should be angry about this. Both writers make good points. Because I value unbiased access and accurate information, I should champion their cause.  The reason I don’t care, however, is that reviews do not affect my buying habits in one key area: I never pre-order games.  Pre-ordering games is dumb Sure, I’ll pay for tickets two weeks in advance of a movie’s debut. I’ll spend recommendation credits with The Lovely Paula over a TV show I think is going to be awesome. I might buy an advance copy of a book if it’s from an author I like.  But video games? Not gonna. No way, no how.  Video games require much more in terms of money and time. I want to make sure I’ll get plenty of hours of enjoyment and that my $60 won’t be wasted in a game that GameStop will give me only $2 for later, if it sucks.  My pre-ordering rule also applies to future content in the same game. And the reason I have the hard-and-fast rule: because I’ve been burned before.  The biggest scar I have wasn’t even a pre-order: I bought the Gold Edition of “Tom Clancy’s The Division,” which included two expansions that were not released at the time. I played a while and kind of enjoyed it but had no desire to get my character into the game’s mess of an endgame. I haven’t even downloaded the expansions I paid for and thus regret my decision big-time.  Do I miss out on the rush of playing a video game? No. Not at all. Mainly because I have a job and adult responsibilities that have a bigger say over my time.  I was one of the first in Joplin to buy “No Man’s Sky.” I was in a Wal-Mart Supercenter at midnight — alongside two other guys waiting for the same game, we patiently waited for the hour to strike so we could buy the game that very minute.  Yet I didn’t get to dive in until after work the next day. I had fun. I named planets and animals. I made videos that I posted to the Globe’s website. No worries.  The only exception to this rule has been “Destiny.” I pre-ordered the sequels “The Taken King” and “Rise of Iron” without a second thought, and those have been worth every penny. The exception proves the rule, I guess. The act of buying video games carries enough risk by itself, and I enjoy being part of that first wave of discovery. It’s a reasonable risk, after all.  Pre-ordering games is just too much. Companies might throw all sorts of bonus items and access as a reward, but it’s just not worth the risk.  Companies want pre-orders Those pre-orders are likely the biggest reason Bethesda and others are scaling back review access. If games get too much negative buzz beforehand, then maybe numbers will dip. Bethesda all but confirmed that in its announcement: “We sent review copies (of ‘Doom’) to arrive the day before launch, which led to speculation about the quality of the game. Since then, ‘Doom’ has emerged as a critical and commercial hit and is now one of the highest-rated shooters of the past few years.” If “Doom” had been released a week early, that’s a week of bad press about “speculation” the company has to endure. Or is it? If “Doom” really is a critical and commercial hit (it is), then that’s a week of great buzz that should lead to more pre-orders, right?  I don’t know because I’m not a sucker who pre-orders games.  Here’s the thing: Consumers are usually pretty smart. When a movie company pulls back a new movie from reviews, that’s generally a sign that the movie will be terrible, and the numbers reflect that. Video game players are even more savvy: I believe that the people who pre-order do so out of loyalty — they had such a great experience with previous offerings that they have a lot of trust and faith in the upcoming product.  That’s why this new trend just doesn’t worry me. It’s not going to change gamers’ buying habits.  Joe Hadsall is features editor for the Globe. Contact him at jhadsall@joplinglobe.com. We have recently upgraded our commenting system.

Mexico Is Eating America's Lunch Bloomberg 10/30/2016 Nacha Cattan < PREVIOUS SLIDESLIDE 1 of 13NEXT SLIDE > © Jake Lindeman/Bloomberg It’s been a fixture of Donald Trump’s campaign rallies: Global trade is a problem for U.S. workers, and the source of their pain can be found in some other country. Most often Mexico and China get the blame, but the culprit might also be Vietnam or South Korea. These countries, the Republican candidate likes to say, are “eating our lunch.” Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 70.49 -0.74 -1.04% Tyson Foods Inc TSN ▲ 68.48 +1.94 +2.92% Turns out Trump’s metaphor is, in one sense, objectively true—just not exactly how he would have voters believe. An American browsing the aisles of a Selecto supermarket such as this one just outside Mexico City would find much that is familiar. Mexicans at this upscale grocery in Naucalpan are scooping Cap’n Crunch cereal for breakfast, eating U.S. beef for lunch, and snacking on Oreo cookies after dinner, all brought across Mexico's northern border. Nabisco, the manufacturer of Oreos and other snacks, has indeed opened a factory in Mexico—something Trump likes to note in his campaign appearances. But that hasn't stopped discerning Mexican shoppers from buying Oreo, Chips Ahoy!, and another 10 kinds of Nabisco cookies imported from the U.S. In all, Selecto imports up to 15 percent of its inventory, and most of those imports come from the U.S. The chain, owned by a domestic competitor to Wal-Mart known as Grupo Comercial Chedraui, is one of a growing number of stores that have cropped up in the past five years that cater to Mexico's expanding middle class by offering more variety. A supermarket offers an unusually clear window into the trade partnership between Mexico and the U.S., in which goods from auto parts to oil cross the border several times, creating jobs on both sides before they’re ready for sale. Mexico imports far more from the U.S. than from anywhere else, and those shipments have tripled since the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect in 1994. Food and beverages are no exception: Of all the food Mexico imports, nearly four-fifths comes from the U.S. Tyson Foods and Coca-Cola are among the biggest sellers of American products in Mexico, according to Mexican government data. Even Mexican beer relies on ingredients made in America: Mexico imports more than six times as much American malt as it did before NAFTA.

(AP Photo/Gregory Payan) , By MARK WHICKER / STAFF COLUMNIST Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF KINSTON, N.C. – Chris Bradshaw stood in the empty Kinston High gym, a warm place on a hot July morning. “I remember the day Michael Jordan and Laney High came in here and played us,” he said. “He went for 45 points. I said, ‘OK.’” Banners from six of Kinston’s 11 state championships were on the wall. Jordan only passed through. The real history is homegrown. In 2012 Brandon Ingram, then 6-foot-5, made all eight of his free-throw attempts in Kinston’s 2-A state championship game against Cuthbertson. “I wasn’t stressed about it, didn’t feel pressure,” he said the other day after a Lakers practice. He was 15 that day. His last two free throws wiped out Cuthbertson’s last lead. The Vikings won by three. A year later they beat Cuthbertson again, also by three. Kinston beat North Rowan by 10 in the 2-A final in 2014. It thrashed West Lincoln by 17 in 2015. Ingram and Darnell Dunn became the first players in state history to win four consecutive championships. By then Ingram had already navigated a recruiting frenzy and chosen Duke. He also quit growing two inches per year, as he had from the eighth grade on. His parents, Donald and Joann, had to take him to big-and-tall shops to get shirts for his lengthening arms. Brandon was 6-foot-9 with a 7-3 wingspan, but still remembered how to play point guard. Now he could play in the lane. He superseded positions. At Duke he played big forward when Amile Jefferson got hurt, but in the NCAA West Regional in Anaheim he operated from the top of the key. He became the second overall pick in the NBA draft. He is with the New Lakers, a prime example of the New Athlete. Michigan’s Jabril Peppers plays all over the gridiron. The Cubs’ Javier Baez brings all the gloves with him. “Sometimes I’d have to whisper in his ear when we were down five or 10, that it was time to take over,” said Bradshaw, who coached Ingram in the seventh and eighth grades. “He grew four inches between eighth grade and the ninth. I knew he was getting ready to be a problem. I told his dad he was going to be special.” THREE ON THREE The Ingrams live in a handsome two-story brick house outside town. Donald runs a gym, known as Martin C. Freeman or Teachers Memorial. Brandon’s brother Bo helped Kinston win a state title in 2008. Bo went to junior college and then Texas-Arlington, and he is at Brandon’s side in L.A. Donald also played. For years he was on the Hoop It Up tour, a nationwide 3-on-3 league. One day he was opposing David Thompson, who led N.C. State to the 1974 sacking of the UCLA dynasty. Thompson was a holy man in North Carolina, far bigger than Jordan became. He was the first mainstream African-American sports star, with an outlandish leap and a deadpan serenity. Thompson played at Reynolds Coliseum, where Ingram hit all those foul shots. Donald was impressed when he ran into Thompson or Orlando Woolridge, but not shy. “When Donald crossed halfcourt it was going up,” Bradshaw said. “There were four of us,” Donald said, “because we had alternates. O.J. Sheppard, Terry Shiver, David Lawrence and me. We’d wind up flying from everywhere and meeting at the airport. The finals were in Venice Beach one year. They’d block off the streets wherever we played. A cellular phone company started sponsoring us. And if you kept winning you might make $10,000.” Donald’s teams went after matchups. Otherwise, everybody did everything. In 2015 Golden State won an NBA title doing that. Its assistant coach, Luke Walton, now coaches Brandon. Luke’s dad Bill led the UCLA team that lost to Thompson. Few strangers in basketball. Fewer boundaries. “You just played,” Donald said. SIGNING UP FOR THIS Teachers Memorial is like a basketball Wal-Mart. Fight the crowds, and you can find any game you want. “We put a piece of paper up there,” Donald explained. “The first five who sign up play together. They play the next five. It’s open gym. If you win you stay on the court. I’m 50 and I might be playing with guys 18, 40, 26, 35. That’s why I don’t worry about Brandon’s weight (195). He’s been banging with grown men for a long time. “After the gym closed, he’d do his own workout. I never had to push him. When I grabbed my keys to go to the gym, he’d grab his stuff.” Brandon remembers winning “at least 10 games” in a row several times. “I remember the intensity and the energy,” he said. “You lose, you might be out 6-7 games.” That, he said, is why Kinston punches so far above its weight in basketball. It sits between Raleigh and the Atlantic and numbers about 21,000. But Cedric Maxwell, Jerry Stackhouse (who sponsored Ingram’s AAU team), Charles Shackleford, Herbert Hill, Reggie Bullock and Mitchell Wiggins all came from Kinston or Lenoir County. Said North Carolina coach Roy Williams earlier this year, “I’d rather go recruit in Kinston than New York City.” Not everything else has thrived. The city has lost one-eighth of its population in the past 50 years. It relied on textiles and tobacco, which became unreliable. There are patches of recovery, but basketball is the civic ID. “There are so many gyms,” Brandon said. “It’s a small town, not much to do. For a lot of kids, it’s a way out.” Yet Ingram stayed as long as he could. He didn’t transfer to one of those pseudo-schools where the basketball team is the false front, like Rock Ridge in “Blazing Saddles.” “I’m a homebody,” he said. “Kinston is where my friends are. I knew I could get what I needed by staying at a public school, and I wanted those championships.” Recruiting was a spectacle. “We had paparazzi,” said Donald, who told Brandon to cut down his list of schools. “And call the coaches back like a man and tell them you’re not coming,” he instructed. “They didn’t text you to recruit you. Don’t text them.” Duke always was the leader. Ingram was a fan of Kyle Singler, another wide-ranging player. And Duke offered big minutes. Ingram averaged 17.3 points and 6.8 rebounds. He shot 41 percent from “three.” He was the ACC Freshman of the Year. Throughout, Ingram’s sleepy eyes betrayed nothing. “Sometimes I look at him and I wonder what he’s thinking,” Donald said. “(Kentucky coach) John Calipari and Bill Self (Kansas) are coming through and he doesn’t seem excited. I’m jumping in, trying to take pictures of those cats. “But he’s progressed and he’s doing something I wanted to do. They say I’m living through my son. Well, I put clothes on his back for 18 years. If he wants to reverse the roles, I’m OK with that.” Reversing a franchise will be weighty enough.

This is the fourth Discount Tire store in Victoria.   Angela Piazza for The Victoria Advocate Discount Tire is opening a fourth store in Victoria at 3904 Houston Highway on Jan. 6. The store has a new prototype layout with a spacious showroom and waiting area for customers, said Sarah Broyles, Discount Tire spokeswoman. The 7,000-square-foot store will offer all-weather and winter tires in addition to regular products to cater to Victoria's weather and community requirements. The store is one of several to locate along Houston Highway in recent months. "We are experiencing commercial retail office building growth," said Dianne Jernigan, a real estate broker with Victoria-based Woolson Realtors. Jernigan said big retailers such as Wal-Mart attract customers and, in turn, other service-oriented commercial businesses. "I think proximity to their customer base is key for a commercial business - the new location is more convenient for their customers who live in the area of Houston Highway and the southern part of the city," Jernigan said. New commercial retail development is starting to look good along the south side of Houston Highway near the new Discount Tire store, she said. "There is a nucleus of development there," she said. "When traffic is attracted to an area, then consumers go to that area." The company expects to hire about 20 full- and part-time employees for the new store, Broyles said. The new store will also offer free trade-in and air pressure checks and a mechanic facility similar to the other stores in the city. "The business is growing, and Discount Tire wants to meet the demand," she said. "Discount Tire keeps adding stores to locations where the demand keeps growing." The tire store chain has been in business since 1960.

Insurers and pharmacy benefit managers blame pharmaceutical companies. Drug makers blame insurers. And have you seen how much money the hospitals spend? Whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump wins on Nov. 8, most of the players are betting that something will get done on the cost of prescription drugs. They're laying defensive and offensive groundwork for when new laws are drawn up by a Congress that has spent the last year holding hearings on the issue. A prime example is a new ad out Wednesday from the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, the Washington lobby group, making the case that high list prices don't represent what drug makers really get and that middlemen take a big cut. "While the list price is often used in stories about prescription drug costs, it's not what the drug company makes," says a narrator. "Most of the control over the final cost to you, the patient, rests with your insurance company, or employer, or the PBM." The ad push began last month and the group has plans for more, said Matt Gorman, a spokesman. The blame game is getting more intense as lobbying groups see a must-pass piece of legislation to fund the Food and Drug Administration as a vehicle for price regulation. Every five years, the pharmaceutical industry negotiates "user fees" they'll pay the FDA to review new drug applications. The current authorization of the law ends in September. "We are very much focused on user fees as an opportunity," KJ Hertz, senior legislative representative on AARP's federal health and family team, said in an interview. "Everyone is looking for this to be an issue in 2017." AARP, which represents seniors, is part of the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing, along with Anthem Inc., one of the U.S.'s biggest health insurers, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. The coalition has proposed having drugmakers submit for government review any price increases over 10 percent, and making it easier for generics to come to market. Health insurers, who just six years ago were painted as villains during the passage of Obamacare, are relishing the turnabout now that drug makers are the focus. "These increases have got to stop," said John Bennett, chief executive officer of Capital District Physicians' Health Plan Inc., or CDPHP, a not-for-profit health insurer in Albany, N.Y. Last year, 22 percent of the premiums Capital took in for its commercial plans was spent on drugs. "They are unsustainable for us as a society and they are morally wrong," Bennett said in a telephone interview. "They are extracting profit out of a scarce resource that people need to survive."

SHARE ‘Cool’ Mr. Quail Redlands man shares unique bond with abandoned Gambel's quail Paul Sanders found a very little Mr. Quail shivering and abandoned in March. Mr. Quail has thrived in Sanders’ care and recently has been trying out mating calls. Mr. Quail will perch on Paul Sanders’ shoulder and comes when Sanders whistles. “It’ll be hard to let him go…” Sanders says. “His personality is so cool.” Mr. Quail eventually will join other Gambel’s quail in the area of Paul Sanders’ home. “The social pull of nature is really strong,” Sanders sa Mr. Quail was about the size of a walnut when Paul Sanders found the Gambel’s quail under his porch. As Mr. Quail has grown, he has taken to eating the chickens’ food and chasing Sanders’ dog, Buddy. Mr. Quail was about the size of a walnut when Paul Sanders found the Gambel’s quail under his porch.

As Mr. Quail has grown, he has taken to eating the chickens’ food and chasing Sanders’ dog, Buddy. By Rachel Sauer Saturday, October 29, 2016 Maybe it’s that little plume of dark feathers atop his head that lends him such a purposeful air, as though wherever he’s going he needs to get there right away. Call it the topknot of busy-ness, leading the way as he goes about doing what he needs to do — which includes, but is not limited to, eating the chickens’ food, standing sentry on the back fence and chasing the dog. Poor Buddy. All that spazzy bundle of ecru curls wants to do is run in frantic, aimless circles around the backyard when out of nowhere, ha-HA, Mr. Quail darts from under a teal Adirondack chair in the middle of the lawn and rushes after the hapless canine. His feather plume bobs as he sprints faster than a ground-based bird roughly the dimensions of a prize-winning turnip should be able to. Meanwhile, the six chickens obliviously peck around in the compost box. This has become a normal tableau in Paul Sanders’ Redlands backyard since March, when he found a tiny, shivering Gambel’s quail chick the size of a walnut under his front porch. Since then, the literally named Mr. Quail has grown into a glossy, sassy bird who struts around the house like he owns the place. “He’d lost his covey,” Sanders explained, “and they lose their body heat really fast.” He admitted that he knows it’s not what wildlife officials advise, but ... the little guy was so tiny! Sanders scooped him up and took him inside immediately, putting him directly under a lamp to warm him up with some radiant heat. It’s not the first time Sanders, 39, a physical therapist and life-long animal lover, has happened across a tiny bird on its own and given it a temporary home with him and Buddy. In 2013, he found a baby sparrow that he named Lucky and nursed until she feathered out and eventually felt confident enough to fly around during the day and, eventually, bring a boyfriend home to meet Sanders. So, even though he logically knew he shouldn’t, he couldn’t just let nature take its course with that bitsy quail, whose head plume at that point looked like a rumpled mess of adorable bed-head. Because Sanders, who grew up in California, had won a scholarship to a summer ornithology camp in Keystone when he was 12, he knew enough about birds to know Mr. Quail would do well eating bird seed, crushed broccoli and grub worms bought 36 for $1.50 at Walmart. And he did. Except for one touch-and-go episode when Mr. Quail nibbled on an elephant ear houseplant — Sanders didn’t know they’re poisonous to birds — he thrived. He slept, and continues to sleep, in a cage in the kitchen at night, and roamed the backyard during the day, playing with the chickens, pecking for worms and, occasionally, chasing Buddy. Lately, Sanders said, Mr. Quail hops the fence and wanders the rocky open space that abuts the backyard, mingling with passing coveys of quail. “Eventually, he’ll bond with those other birds,” Sanders said. “The social pull of nature is really strong. And that’s how it should be. Pretty soon he’ll stay out at night and then join a covey. “It’ll be hard to let him go. I just like him so much that I’ve been hanging on to him longer than I should. His personality is so cool.” In the summer, when Sanders worked on his raised-bed garden, Mr. Quail pecked around in the soil right beside him. He perches on Sanders’ shoulders and responds when Sanders whistles. They eat breakfast together on the back porch when the weather is nice. The other day, when Sanders was in the front driveway working on his car, Mr. Quail flew over the house — and this was a big effort, because quail aren’t big on flying — to bustle around in the front yard while Sanders was nearby. Lately, Sanders said, Mr. Quail has been trying out mating calls, evidence that he’s growing up and maybe thinking about moving out. It’s the natural order and the way things should be, but still a little “Sunrise Sunset.” Until he flies over the wooden back fence and joins a new covey for good, though, there will be sunny afternoons in the backyard with the chickens, companionable breakfasts and ninja ambushes of a silly dog running in aimless circles.

The USA Today review of Amazon's financial statements and data from the U.S. Commerce Department found that items sold by Amazon comprised about 15 percent of overall e-commerce in the country. But the addition of items sold by third-parties via Amazon's website or mobile app appears to at least double that share. That would place the value of Amazon's e-retail business at up to $125 billion per year, or 30 percent of the overall domestic market. Other estimates place that total even higher. Third-party sales don't generate as much revenue for the Seattle e-retailer — vendors instead pay a fraction of the price to Amazon as a commission — but the volume of those sales underscores how important Amazon already is to e-commerce. And as its share of e-commerce continues to grow — and as its delivery options become broader and faster — analysts believe Amazon could completely upend the U.S. retail market. Just as Walmart undercut local retail centers in past decades, Amazon's ability to ship thousands of items to doorsteps in as little as two hours could jeopardize even big box stores. “The more power Amazon gets, the tougher it makes it for those independent retailers,” Jason Goldberg of e-commerce marketing agency Razorfish told the paper.

President Elect Trump Addresses Nation; Secretary Clinton Calls Him to Concede Home » News » Report highlights growing role of outside spending in W.Va. elections‏ Report highlights growing role of outside spending in W.Va. elections‏ Sunday, October 30, 2016 - 01:31 Updated 2 weeks ago Edited from a Press Release CHARLESTON – After spending $5.6 million during the last presidential election year, outside groups have reported spending more than $15 million on West Virginia elections so far in 2016 — closely rivaling the $16.3 million in reported spending by candidates for executive, legislative, and judicial offices.   This year’s outside spending by race breaks down as follows:  Attorney General - $5.3, Governor - $3.7, Supreme Court - $3.6 million. Third party organizations have also spent $2.4 million in various state Senate races, with more than $900,000 going into the race for a seat in the 4th Senatorial District currently held by Senate Majority Leader Mitch Carmichael (R-Jackson). To date, groups have spent $186,175 attacking Carmichael and $661,068 supporting his Democratic opponent Brian Prim.   As West Virginians begin going to the polls, a coalition of organizations working to increase accountability and transparency in elections released a report highlighting the growing role of outside spending in state elections and the need to strengthen disclosure laws so that voters can be better informed about who is trying to influence their votes.   “If we want a government that is truly of, by, and for the people, we must demand an electoral system that puts the voices of everyday voters first,” said Natalie Thompson, co-coordinator of WV Citizens for Clean Elections (WVCCE). “To address the money being spent by special interest groups, our next legislature must make election transparency a top issue. Full disclosure of campaign cash is an important step to ensuring our government works for all of the state’s residents, not a few anonymous donors. All West Virginians have a right to know exactly where the money is coming from,” stated Thompson.   The report, prepared for WVCCE by recent Marshall University graduate Logan Bush, profiles super PACs that were active in the 2014 election and the May 2016 race for the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals. The report also details potential conflicts of interest by legislators who benefited from expenditures paid for by these organizations. An addendum to the report provides an overview spending by third-party political groups during the current election cycle. Spending totals and analysis are based on a review of disclosure reports filed with the Secretary of State.   Bush said the report shows the need for reform. “West Virginia needs a government that represents all of its citizens, not one that only represents a select group of outsiders and corporations,” said Bush.   In addition, to calling attention to the outside money being spent by various special interest groups, the coalition’s report also makes specific policy recommendations. Although the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Citizens United, has made oversight and regulation of campaign finance more difficult, disclosure is a key area of reform allowed under the decision. Accordingly, WVCCE supports requiring any group that spends more than $1,000 in a calendar year to influence our elections to disclose its donors to the Secretary of State and closing the “covered transfers” loophole that allows wealthy donors and special interests to funnel money through multiple PACs and organizations in order to obscure its origin.   “It’s important to keep in mind that our analysis only includes spending that was disclosed to the Secretary of State,” said Julie Archer, co-coordinator of WVCCE. “Unfortunately, under current law it would be impossible to fully determine the amount of money being spent on our elections or even to know the identity of who is behind some of the groups that have filed disclosure reports. A first step to fight back against big money in our elections is to make sure that every group – liberal and conservative – attempting to sway our elections has to disclose where the money came from,” Archer said.   The top spending groups this election cycle are: ·       Mountaineers Always Free PAC, formed by the Republican Attorney Generals Association (RAGA) to help Patrick Morrisey (R) retain his position as West Virginia’s Attorney General. The group, which has received much of its funding from coal and electricity companies, has spent $5.3 million supporting Morrisey and attacking his opponent, Delegate Doug Reynolds (D-Cabell).  ·       The Republican State Leadership Committee’s Judicial Fairness Initiative spent $2.6 million supporting Beth Walker, the winner of the May Supreme Court race, and attacking two of her opponents, Darrell McGraw and Bill Wooton. The RSLC’s top donors include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation’s two largest tobacco companies, Wal-Mart, and Koch Industries. ·       The Republican Governors Association (RGA), through its Right Direction PAC, has spent nearly $2.5 million to help Senate President Bill Cole (R-Mercer) in his race against Democrat Jim Justice. According to the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP), the RAGA, the RSLC, and the RGA have several major donors in common. ·       West Virginia Family Values, a super PAC funded by labor unions and trial attorneys, has spent $2.2 million in several State Senate races, primarily in support of Democrats and against Republicans. ·       Good Jobs West Virginia has spent more than $900,000 in the Governor’s race attacking Bill Cole. The group’s top donors are the Democratic Governors Association (DGA) and Jobs and Opportunity, a federal PAC funded primarily by the DGA. The DGA’s top donors include Blue Cross/Blue Shield and several major pharmaceutical companies, according to CRP.   Among the reports key findings: ·       Prior to the run-up to the November general election, much of the super PAC spending in 2016 went into May’s state Supreme Court race. Super PACs spent more than $3.6 million to influence the outcome of the race — nearly $2 million more than all five candidates’ campaigns combined. (According to the Brennan Center for Justice, spending by outside groups has played a larger role in 2016 state supreme court elections than in past years.) ·       West Virginia has seen a sharp increase in outside spending in recent years. In 2014, third party organizations spent more than $2.5 million on legislative races alone. This was a five-fold increase in the amount of outside money spent to influence legislative races in 2012 and more than eight times as much as was spent by third parties during the previous mid-term election in 2010. (A recent analysis by the National Institute on Money in State Politics found that, in 2013 and 2014, a record $372 million was spent independently on state-level elections in 29 states.) ·       Outside spending on behalf of candidates has a real effect on the outcome of the elections. In 2014, incumbent legislators supported by super PACs won more than 83% of the time, while incumbents that relied solely on their personal campaigns won around 67% of the time. However, super PAC spending had the biggest impact on candidates challenging incumbents. With the help of super PACs, challengers won nearly half (47.6%) of their races, while challengers who lacked super PAC support only won 15% of the time. ·       Even though the majority of the reported third party spending on legislative races in 2014 came in the form of “independent expenditures,” disclosure reports for over half of the money failed to mention the position (for or against) expressed in the expenditures. State law requires entities making “independent expenditures” to say “whether the expenditure is intended to support or oppose” the candidates identified in the expenditure.   The report is available at http://wvoter-owned.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/CampaignFinancein21stCentury_FINAL.pdf.

(Photo source: WLOX) One hundred percent of the increase would go towards the city's Parks and Recreation Master Plan - which will enhance many of Pascagoula's athletic facilities. (Photo source: WLOX) Restaurant Owner Rob Hart says the tax will put a strain on the already struggling restaurant businesses in Pascagoula. (Photo source: WLOX) PASCAGOULA, MS (WLOX) - Signs line the streets of Pascagoula encouraging residents to vote "yes" in the upcoming special election to increase the restaurant tax. "I just think they should go out and vote 'yes,' support Pascagoula, support the city and support our city," said tax supporter Evelyn Davis. One hundred percent of the increase will go towards the city's Parks and Recreation Master Plan - which will enhance many of the city's athletic facilities. "This gives Pascagoula another avenue to get resources that can be used to help enrich the youth activities," said Barbara Walker. Tuesday's vote is the last push for residents to approve the two percent increase on prepared food. The tax was voted on once before in August, but failed to pass. Citing low voter turnout and confusion over polling places - city leaders decided to let residents vote again. "We're paying taxes in other cities, we're paying taxes in other states, we can keep our money here so we can have nice facilities," said Davis. But not everyone is on board. Rob Hart, the owner of Rob's on the Side, says the tax will put a strain on the already struggling restaurant businesses in Pascagoula. "It's gonna affect me and a lot of other restaurants here who are on the borderline," said Hart. Hart is a Pascagoula native. He said while he supports parks and recreation in the city, he believes there are better streams of revenue to pay for the upgrades. "If it's good enough for the restaurants, it's good enough for Wayne Lee's, Jerry Lee's, Family Dollar, Dollar General, Walmart. Let everyone in Pascagoula who wants the upgrades to pay for it, not just the restaurants," said Hart. November 1, voters will have the final say on the tax. Remember, this election is not the same day as the presidential election. The city sent maps marking each resident's voting precincts for both elections in their utility bills. Click here to see an online map of Pascagoula's voting precincts.  Copyright 2016 WLOX. All rights reserved.  News on WMCTV.comNewsMore>> CBU releases renderings of expansion plans CBU releases renderings of expansion plans Updated: Monday, November 14 2016 7:40 PM EST2016-11-15 00:40:36 GMT (SOURCE: CBU) Christian Brothers University has a master plan for expanding and providing a new system for preparing teachers.  More >> Christian Brothers University has a master plan for expanding and providing a new system for preparing teachers. More >> Father shot at library says he was trying to get a job, provide for his son Father shot at library says he was trying to get a job, provide for his son Updated: Monday, November 14 2016 7:26 PM EST2016-11-15 00:26:47 GMT (Source: SCSO) The man accused of shooting another man at a library said it was in self defense, but the victim said he's never seen the man before in his life.More >> The man accused of shooting another man at a library said it was in self defense, but the victim said he's never seen the man before in his life.More >> New Research shows distracted driving affects a driver's health New Research shows distracted driving affects a driver's health Updated: Monday, November 14 2016 7:12 PM EST2016-11-15 00:12:43 GMT (Source: NBC News) It's no secret that distracted driving is dangerous, but new research from Texas A&M University shows it can also impact your health.

It was a third-floor walk-up, very large, and only $850 a month. When my roommate moved out, the landlord said that I actually was subletting against the lease, which wasn’t true. When I came home one day, they had hired movers to put all my stuff in storage, and changed the locks. I took my case to the Residential Tenancy Branch and won, but I couldn’t get my apartment back. It took six months to get through the tribunal, and by that time they had repainted the apartment, upped the rent to $1300, and moved someone else in. It was a sneak renoviction. Luckily I was renting a studio for my art, and after I was evicted, I was able to move into that space. Back in 1986, 339 Railway challenged the city bylaws so that parts of Chinatown and downtown’s industrial district will permit artists to live in their studios—provided that more than 10 per cent of the square footage isn’t modified for living purposes. Because it’s a commercial tenancy, though, it’s not covered under the Residential Tenancy Act. I lived there for five years, but they were able to evict me without much notice. There were 30 people that lost their work space, and a number lost their homes. Next I went to a few house showings I found on Craigslist. A number of them told me that the viewings were cancelled because they’ve had too many applications, and the few I did see were packed with people climbing over each other to fill out forms. There were at least a dozen people in line for each one-bedroom condo. It was very discouraging. Instead, I shipped all my stuff up to my Dad’s in Powell River, and decided to live in my van. My overheads are just insurance, gas, and parking. The van is not fuel efficient and parking tickets are bad, so if you’re not careful that can cost a fair bit of money. It’s hard to entertain people, so my social life basically only exists of work. I also can’t cook so I have to go out to restaurants a lot more, which can be expensive. But it’s still cheaper than renting. When I’ve parked to find a spot to sleep for the night, sometimes there’s dozens of other vehicles—mainly all over Strathcona, and in Grandview by the Walmart and Costco. I have no idea how many of us are living in our vans, though. It’s funny. For the last two years, I volunteered to help with the homeless count. I didn’t think that I would be homeless myself one day. I would stay with my Dad full-time, but I work in the film industry, so I have to be here. It’s not difficult to find work, but it’s incredible difficult to find somewhere to live that’s really worth the trouble. It’s a frankly moronic situation that Vancouver’s real estate is so bad that there’s an abundance of work here, but people have nowhere to live. This isn’t Fort McMurray or anything. It’s an industrialized, major city. My long term plans are to save as much money as I can and then get out of Vancouver. I’ve got a leave of absence from medical school, and I’m planning on returning in the autumn next year. Hopefully by then I’ll be out of the van.” Got a story to share? Tweet Kate Wilson here.

They were calling for justice in the police shooting of Keith Scott. The protesters were pushed back up a hill by police who had temporarily closed that section of the freeway in anticipation of the coming protests. Justine Miller jmiller@mcclatchy.com A protestor kicks a tear gas canister fired by Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officers along Old Concord Rd. in Charlotte, NC on Sept. 20. A protest began on Old Concord Road at Bonnie Lane, where a Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officer fatally shot Keith Lamont Scott in the parking lot of The Village at College Downs apartment complex. Jeff Siner jsiner@charlotteobserver.com Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officers walk through a haze of tear gas on Old Concord Rd. in Charlotte, NC on Sept. 20. Jeff Siner jsiner@charlotteobserver.com 1 of 3 i By Michael Gordon, Mark Washburn and Fred Clasen-Kelly mgordon@charlotteobserver.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Against the fury of a mob and a hailstorm of stone, Charlotte police were powerless to rescue even themselves in the earliest hours of September’s rioting. Filings this week in federal court provide the most detailed accounting to date of two nights of unprecedented violence that crippled Charlotte after the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott on the afternoon of Sept. 20. Details of the city’s response are contained in a filing made by city attorneys in response to a complaint from eight Charlotte residents that police used tear gas, riot techniques and other forms of excessive force against peaceful protesters. Their attorneys asked a judge to issue a temporary restraining order banning police from using such tactics against non-violent demonstrators. What emerges is a portrait of a city overwhelmed by violence, fueled by deepening national protests of police shootings of African-Americans. Although thousands demonstrated peacefully for a week, the account focuses on pockets of vandalism, looting and assaults on police that attracted international attention. According to the city’s chronology, evidence technicians began to be escorted from the scene about four hours after an officer shot Scott. Darkness fell and menacing crowds gathered around them. At 9 p.m., an officer found himself trapped in his car – he was surrounded by a crowd and people started jumping on his vehicle and tried to overturn it. Officers who came to his aid were then encircled by the taunting crowd, estimated at 150 people. A call went out for two squads of officers from the Civil Emergency Unit, the city’s riot unit. By 9:30 p.m., they set up a defensive line so the last of the crime scene officers could reach their cars. Commanders then decided that removing the 30 or so riot police might de-escalate the situation. A CATS bus was sent to get them, but agitation was growing around them. At 10 p.m., tensions surged. “News cameras turn on lights for live broadcasts,” says an affidavit filed in the case, “and the level of irritation in the crowd grows noticeably.” At 10:15 p.m., a fusillade of bottles rained down on officers. Then some in the crowd found a pile of rocks at a nearby rail bed improvement project. They unleashed them on police, who retreated to the bus – and were quickly surrounded. Response to suit In the court filing made by city attorneys Daniel Peterson and Mark Newbold, police acknowledge using an array of munitions – from tear gas to smoke canisters to sting grenades and non-lethal bullets. But they say they used the chemical weapons and other force either to defend themselves or after giving protesters ample warning. Documents describe police fleeing the crowd that had threatened to overwhelm them on the first night of violence, when officers were pelted with rocks for at least three hours – leading to more than a dozen injuries – before protective shields arrived. In another instance, an uptown protester rubbed the blood of shooting victim Justin Carr upon the faces of several officers standing near her. In several instances, police commanders limited their response to the growing violence in an attempt to defuse tensions, documents indicate. Amid the largely peaceful protests, city attorneys said, officers were sometimes the target of violence from residents they were sworn to protect. “Rather, this case is about a throng of people, in the immediate hours and days after Mr. Scott’s death, that took advantage of the perceived anonymity of the crowd, in order to perpetrate mayhem,” they wrote. “Specifically, CMPD officers were assaulted with rocks and other large projectiles ... private citizens were assaulted, one person was murdered, businesses were damaged and looted, tractor trailers were ransacked, traffic was blockaded and fires were set in the streets of Charlotte and on Interstate 85.” [READ MORE: Sept. 21: Man shot in uptown during protests] [READ MORE: Sept. 21: State of emergency declared after rioting] [READ MORE: Sept. 23: Scott’s wife releases cell phone video] [READ MORE: Sept 24: Police release videos of Scott shooting] [READ MORE: Sept. 26: Mayor faces furious crowd at City Council meeting] [READ MORE: Oct. 6: Reconstruction of the Scott shooting scene] Braxton Winston, one of the citizens who brought the lawsuit against police, said demonstrators at the shooting scene that afternoon were demanding that Mayor Jennifer Roberts, Police Chief Kerr Putney and other city officials come to the scene to answer questions about Scott’s death. Police and citizens at first interacted calmly. Officers answered questions and engaged in conversation with people crowded around the shooting scene. But according to the city’s filings, Winston’s own Facebook video stream also reflected how the civility deteriorated. “F--- the police,” the crowd chanted. Other bystanders screamed in officers’ faces, “You’re a bitch ass n-----,” the documents said. First tear gas Surrounded at the CATS bus on the first night and under assault by rocks, Sgt. Sam Orlov grabbed what he thought was a smoke canister to drive the crowd back. Instead, he threw a tear gas container, the filings said. According to an affidavit from Maj. Mike Campagna, Capt. Ken Schul used the bus public address system to warn that police would use chemical agents if the crowds did not allow the bus to leave. Instead members of the crowd moved in and rocks flew, keeping some police from boarding the bus. Police fired what is known as a stinger grenade, which contains rubber pellets and an irritant known as OC powder, then a flash bomb, the documents said. Then the bus pulled out. Other riot officers were still lined up nearby on old Concord Road. As the crowd descended, the police formed two lines, back to back, to protect themselves. They were soon surrounded. Officer Chris Frunzi was struck and went down. Officer Benjamin Hearn was hit in the shoulder and forearm. Officer Jay Rubino took a rock to the head and suffered a concussion. Just before 11 p.m., police gave another dispersal order followed by hand-tossed tear-gas canisters “in a self-defensive effort to cease the barrage of rocks being thrown at officers,” the documents said. Rifle case in car Police tried to head south but were blocked by the crowd. They moved to a nearby overpass, leaving a marked police car behind. It was soon looted, forcing the officers to push back into the crowd to the car to keep a rifle case from being stolen “and used by a rioter on a civilian or CMPD officer,” the filing said. All the while, the barrage of rocks continued, the violence worsening. Outnumbered 4 to 1, police started firing non-lethal ammunition containing a powdered irritant. At 11:45 p.m., a portion of the crowd headed toward nearby W.T. Harris Boulevard, damaging two police cars. At midnight, after police say they had been under attack for some three hours, protective shields finally arrived. At 1 a.m., the crowd headed toward Interstate 85. Twenty-five minutes later, with police now more than a mile away, demonstrators blocked traffic at Harris and North Tryon Street and then on I-85 by pulling construction barrels into the roadways. “At that point, CMPD had no choice but to re-engage to stop this illegal conduct and dispatched a full platoon of [riot] officers to I-85,” the filing said. Looting of I-85 trucks The violence would continue for more than two hours – with rioters throwing rocks from overpasses on passing I-85 traffic. Tractor-trailers were stopped and looted. Fires were set. Traffic on I-85 halted. Police say they used stinger grenades and other techniques to disperse the crowds. At 3:14 a.m., police reported that rioters were hurling alternators taken from the looted trucks. Several more officers were injured. Capt. Nate King was struck both by a bottle and a rock. Twenty minutes later, police warned employees of the Wal-Mart on North Tryon to lock their doors. Looters broke in anyway. “Employees inside were terrified,” Campagna wrote. “Mobile CEU officers respond quickly and are able to prevent significant damage and looting.” Some began breaking into nearby convenience stores – a QT and a Circle K. It was 4 a.m. before order was restored. Police said about 25 officers were injured, at least two with concussions. Sept. 21: Uptown erupts The next evening, about 1,000 people gathered in Marshall Park to protest the Scott shooting. Later, about half walked to the Little Rock AME Zion Church while the others headed west toward the EpiCentre. Although the uptown group did not have a parade permit, CMPD decided to let the march continue with police keeping traffic out of the way. Just after 8 p.m., they entered the EpiCentre. Campagna was the only officer inside. Within minutes, he heard the shattering of windows at the Kandy Bar and called for help. Chairs were then hurled at Suite, another club at the EpiCentre. Campagna called in the riot squad, led by Capt. Rob Dance. At 8:25 p.m., the riot-clad officers were set up in front of the Omni Hotel, then moved between the Ritz-Carlton and the EpiCentre. When rioters began leaving the EpiCentre, police pulled back to de-escalate, the city said in its filing. “However they had been spotted by the crowd, which immediately followed them up the street.” When the crowd tried to follow the riot squad into the Omni, police established a line by the parking garage on West Trade Street. Crowds moved in. Water bottles were thrown at police. Tear gas at omni. And flash bang? #KeithScott pic.twitter.com/YrdxZ9K29L&mdash; Ely Portillo (@ESPortillo) September 22, 2016 A bang and then blood At 8:30 p.m., “a fuse lit explosive device” – apparently some kind of firecracker – came out of the crowd and exploded at the feet of police. Dance asked superiors for permission to use tear gas. He was turned down out of concern for the number of peaceful demonstrators, filings said. A minute later, 21-year-old Justin Carr, standing between the Omni and College Street, was hit in the head by a gunshot. Rayquan Borum, who police say was in the crowd that night and was caught on surveillance looting a nearby bar, has since been arrested and charged with murder. Authorities say he has admitted to shooting Carr. But the crowd, believing Carr had been shot by police, erupted. A woman who says she was standing next to Carr – later identified as Elsie Marie Greene – rubbed Carr’s blood on the arms and faces of officers Dennis McClain, Nick Palomba and Charles Bolduc, court documents allege. (Greene, who is charged with three counts of assault on a police officer, wouldn’t comment. The officers could not be reached.) Meanwhile, the crush of people blocked medical personnel from reaching Carr, the filing said. Firefighters finally carried him to a van nearby, then took him to a Medic ambulance. At 8:40 p.m., as he drove to the scene, Officer Joseph Pendergrast was struck by a wrench thrown from the crowd. His windshield was also shattered, sending glass into his eye, Campagna’s affidavit said. Looting of the EpiCentre continued. Within minutes, full bottles of beer, liquor and champagne – along with large rocks and concrete – were being thrown at police at Trade and College. According to the affidavit, police began giving a series of dispersal orders to the crowd just before 9 p.m. Eventually, they gave bystanders 20 minutes to leave, then counted down with subsequent orders. When the crowd failed to disperse, Dance gave the order for tear gas and smoke canisters to be used. But then he was struck in the face with something thrown from the crowd and removed for treatment. He later returned. Assaults on police, bystanders Assaults on police and bystanders continued into the night. A group of demonstrators pushed a trash bin filled with cardboard into Trade Street and tried to set it on fire in front of the Transit Center. Police stopped the blaze from being set. Once police moved into the crowds, dozens of otherwise peaceful demonstrators were arrested and charged with such crimes as failure to disperse, impeding traffic and curfew violations. Najah McEntire of Charlotte says the chaos was overwhelming. When police started firing smoke canisters, she told the Observer that she stood in Trade Street with her arms raised. When she was arrested for failure to disperse, she said a police officer shouted in her ear, “Are you proud of yourself? Are you f------ satisfied?” “I was thinking, ‘At any moment, I could be a hashtag,’ ” McEntire told the Observer this week, an account in which she complimented some of the police she dealt with that night. “I made a mistake. I was in Marshall Park, and then I walk into riot gear? What the hell?” Constitutional rights, but whose? The lawsuit filed by the citizens was timed to allow peaceful protests to proceed without police intervention last weekend. Those demonstrations came and went without incident. But the larger issue of how Charlotte-Mecklenburg police will respond to public protests remains. In their lawsuit, the attorneys for the eight residents accuse police of using policies “designed to target and punish demonstrators, and to deter them from ... speech and assembly activities.” Some of those measures, including the use of flash bombs, chemical agents and excessive force, came without warning, they say, and “advanced no legitimate law enforcement objective.” In response, city attorneys say police are experienced in cooperating with residents involved in peaceful protests. This was a riot, they say, not an expression of constitutional rights. “Assaults on police officers,” the attorneys wrote, “are not protected by the First and Second Amendments.” Michael Gordon: 704-358-5095, @MikeGordonOBS Related content Police confrontation with protesters at Interstate 277 LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Crime Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 2:22 Video shows deadly police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott Pause 2:52 Dan DiMicco is Trump trade adviser 0:58 Novant Health Charlotte Marathon 1:58 Artist group claims responsibility for body-shaped installation hanged from trees at Winthrop University 0:31 Fire damages uptown condos under construction 3:36 A timeline of the Charlotte police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott 1:28 Campus hall named after racist needs to change, Winthrop students say 0:08 Military jet buzzes Bank of America Stadium 0:32 Coach Rivera caught off guard by military jet flyover 2:03 Truckload of thieves rips door off gun shop in robbery Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 3 days ago South Mtns State Park wildfire 1:14 3 days ago South Mtns State Park wildfire 2:03 11 days ago Truckload of thieves rips door off gun shop in robbery 0:43 14 days ago One dead in Park Road wreck View more video Crime Charlotte police investigate apparent shooting of teen Driver hits and kills S.C. motorcyclist, eludes police by carjacking another vehicle Even after arrest, many ask: Who killed Justin Carr?

Business Update: Americollect lauded in list USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin 10:11 a.m. CDT October 29, 2016 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Americollect on ‘best workplaces’ list A Manitowoc debt collection agency has been named among the Best Places to Work in Collections. Americollect Inc. has made it on insideARM’s best-places list for the eighth year in a row. The publication covers the ARM — the accounts receivable management, or debt collection — industry. The Manitowoc agency is ranked fifth nationally among the ranking’s “large” companies — those with 150 or more workers. The company’s online profile says it specializes in collections in the health care industry, noting it handles collections work for more than 70 hospitals and more than 7,000 physicians around the country. The “best places” listing includes an analysis of, among other things, agencies’ workplace policies and a survey of employees. For details about the company, visit americollect.com. Cellcom gifts Woodland Dunes A regional cellular and wireless company says it’s donating money to a local nature preserve. Cellcom, based in De Pere and covering a swath of northeast and central Wisconsin and parts of upper Michigan, says it’s awarded a $2,500 “Green Gift” to Two Rivers’ Woodland Dunes Nature Center. The money will support Woodland Dunes’ Cottonwood Trail program, which teaches students how Wisconsin animals survive and grow. The program reaches students in Manitowoc, Brown, Sheboygan and Kewaunee counties. The cell company says it’s giving about $37,800 in Green Gift money to 22 eco-friendly nonprofits in its coverage area. The money comes from the company’s cellphone recycling program. Lakeland Care District nets grant A local public health care organization that offers help to seniors and disabled adults in Manitowoc and other northeast Wisconsin counties has hauled in an employment grant. The Wisconsin Board for People with Developmental Disabilities says it’s given a 2016 Employment First Partner grant to Lakeland Care District. In a news release announcing the award, Lakeland Care says it plans to work with the state Division of Vocational Rehabilitation, other local service providers and local schools to host a “flipped” job fair for people with disabilities. The idea behind the job fair is this: instead of people coming to talk to employers about employment, employers will be invited to come and talk with disabled people for onsite interviews. The job fair is aimed at introducing local job providers to a new potential workforce. The state board says it’s awarded grants to 15 organizations in Wisconsin to increase employment opportunities for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Lakeland Care District runs Family Care, a Medicaid managed care program giving long-term support and service to seniors and disabled adults in northeastern Wisconsin, including in Manitowoc County. Utility, bank partnering on bill payments Manitowoc Public Utilities says it’s partnering with Bank First to process payments. The partnership went into effect Oct. 15, and means all utility payments will get processed through the local bank. The utilities company says the move should speed up processing for payments while keeping the payment processing work local. Utility bills will begin showing a new “remit to” address of P.O. Box 41 in Manitowoc, to which all payments should be sent. For details about the move, contact the utilities’ customer service team at 920-683-4600. City lauded as in employer event The City of Manitowoc was named an “exemplary employer” at Manitowoc County’s second annual Employer Recognition Ceremony Oct. 25. Winning “outstanding” employer awards were A&W and Buffalo Wild Wings restaurants and Carmike Cinema. Other businesses that got recognition at the event included: Christel’s Piggly Wiggly in Valders; City Limits Bar and Banquet Hall; Festival Foods; Manitowoc Health and Rehabilitation Center; Manitowoc Tool & Machining; McDonald’s in Two Rivers; North Ridge Medical and Rehabilitation Center; Planet Fitness; Rick’s Piggly Wiggly in Kiel; River’s Bend Health and Rehabilitation Center; Shady Lane; Shopko in Kiel; Walgreens; and Walmart. County Bancorp reports 3Q income A Manitowoc bank’s holding company reported $3.1 million in net income for the third quarter of 2016, which ended Sept. 30. County Bancorp Inc., the holding company of Investors Community Bank, with headquarters in Manitowoc, says that compares with $3.3 million it reported in net income in 2015’s third quarter. The latest quarter's income translates to 46 cents of diluted earnings per share, compared with 55 cents at the end of the same quarter in 2015. The bank says its total assets by the end of the quarter were $1.2 billion, a $56.6 million jump from the end of its second quarter in June. Total loans were $992.5 million, while deposits totaled $929.4 million. Investors Community Bank also has full-service locations in northeast and central Wisconsin. Bank First reports quarter numbers A Manitowoc-based bank says it earned $3.8 million in net income for the third quarter in 2016, which ended Sept. 30. Bank First National Corporation says that’s an 11.1 percent increase from the same period in 2015. The quarter's income equals 60 cents per share, the bank says. Net income for this year through the third quarter was $11.4 million, or $1.82 per share. Net interest income after provision for loan losses was $9.7 million for the quarter, compared to $8.9 million for the same quarter last year, a 9.9 percent increase. Bank First saw $95.8 million in total loan growth from last September, and ended the period at $1.03 billion in total loans. 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://htrne.ws/2eY9Rnw

On May 5, 2012, Heintz was recovering from not feeling well the previous day. Feeling better, he decided to mow the lawn and remembered that he had to finish some work with the rain gutters. "I was exhausted," Heintz said. "After that, I don't really know what happened." Article Photos Gary Heintz (right), Arbor Park Head Caregiver Joy Frye, and Heintz’s cat pose for a photo. (Submitted photo Heintz tripped over something, causing him to fall and hit his head on the concrete. He couldn't move, thinking he had had a stroke. A neighbor found him, and he was taken to the hospital. Doctors later told him that he had an incomplete spinal cord injury, meaning that his spinal cord had been pinched, cutting off his brain signals to the rest of his body. "I had no control, and the doctor told me there was no hope for me," Heintz said. "I told him, 'No way, I'm going to walk again.'" From there, it has been four and a half years of learning how to live again. "It's like starting your life all over again. I had to learn how to balance and sit up again. I had to learn how to eat again," Heintz said. Heintz attended Sanford Health in Fargo for physical therapy then transferred to Courage Kenny Rehabilitation Institute in Minneapolis, MN. He now resides in Moorhead, MN, in Arbor Park Assisted Living. "It's my home now," Heintz said. "I had hopes of going back [to Rugby], but the doctors said I was not stable enough. That was just a shock to me, that I'd never be able to go to Rugby again. I just wish I could go back and walk into all the small town stores." Heintz began driving school buses in Rugby in 1979, when he was 20 years old. He owned and operated a route until 1990, when Hartley's Buses took over. Heintz then drove for Hartley's, both school buses and charter buses. He drove charter buses for Hartley's from 2000 to 2012. "I miss the challenge of driving the buses in the wintertime," Heintz said. "I miss being around the children, talking to the parents, and being out in the country just enjoying driving. Every day was something different. The kids would always say I was the best driver, which made me feel good. I miss all that." Heintz has lived in Arbor Park for two years now, where he is able to enjoy barbeques in the summertime. Recently, he has found company with the facility's cat, who spends most of her time in Heintz's room. "The darn cat keeps coming into my room, but I don't mind. It's a therapy for me," he said. In addition to playing with his new cat, he surfs the Internet and sometimes visits Walmart. One of Heintz's fondest memories of his time since the accident was when he met Henry Winkler, best known for his role as Arthur Fonzarelli in 'Happy Days.' Winkler was visiting Heintz's facility and gave a speech about the benefits of Botox. "He was the first movie star I ever met in my life," Heintz said. Heintz now spends his days in a power wheelchair. "Every time I drove a school bus, there would be a wheelchair lift," he said. "Now I'm in one." Heintz takes therapy every six months in order to maintain his body. He also exercises every morning and evening for about 45 minutes in order to keep his muscles moving and his body in shape. "I'm in a lot of pain," he said. "A lot of people don't realize what a spinal cord injury does to you. I can't dress myself. I can't go to the bathroom on my own. It was hard to adjust, and I've accepted it. I could be in a lot worse shape. My brain still works, just my body isn't working." Since his injury, Heintz has not had much interaction with his friends in Rugby. "The sad thing is that when something like this happens to you, people shy away from you. They don't know what to say, I think. Your friends, even your family members, stop talking to you," he said. Throughout everything, Heintz remains positive, considering himself lucky to have survived. During his time at the Courage Institute, there were patients who had suffered head trauma and spinal cord injury who became blind from the impact. "They called me a rock star because I was doing so well and had a good attitude and was not giving up," Heintz said. "People complain all the time about things, and I always say, 'I would gladly trade places with you.' If I could go out and walk again and just enjoy life again," Heintz said. "I still enjoy life, just in a different way now."

(Reuters/Thomas Mukoya) Share Written by Joshua Masinde i October 29, 2016 Quartz africa East Africa’s largest retailer, Nakumatt, will cede up to 25% of its shares to an international private equity investor to plug cash flow glitches that have plagued its operations, according to a person close to the company. It comes after a surprise announcement by the Nairobi-based company that it had run into liquidity hiccups after photos of empty shelves at some of its Nakumatt outlets in Uganda circulated on social media. The retailer, which has 61 branches across East Africa, has remained tight lipped on the potential partner it will bring on board but indications are it will not be another supermarket chain but an international private equity financier. Photos of empty shelves at its outlets in Kampala, Uganda’s capital, jolted the retailer to issue a statement saying its business was solid despite challenges triggered by a harsh operating environment. The empty shelves have been linked to contractual fall-out with suppliers in Uganda. What cancer's eating away some of the Nakumatt outlets in Uganda?Lots of empty shelves especially Oasis Branch. This was shot last Saturday pic.twitter.com/ilzNdQTrMa — Jimmy Kiberu (@KiberuJimmy) October 27, 2016 A number of the suppliers opted not to supply the retailer until issues around improving their margins and shortening of the credit period should be agreed on. It is understood that some suppliers demanded to be paid within 30 days or less, despite the supermarket’s credit period ranging from between 180 and 270 days. This had been increased from 90 days when the retailer began facing cash flow challenges. The retailer has also been relying heavily on commercial debt, which stood at $150 million at the start of 2015 up from $42 million at the end of 2011. Should everything go according to plan, the deal will be sealed “in a few weeks”. “With the ongoing financial re-engineering engagements focused on accessing a significant capital injection, we are confident that the overall debt will further reduce once the process is concluded,” the retailer said in a statement. International strategic investors such as WalMart and Carrefour and private equity investors have been eyeing the East Africa’s rising middle class for some time as an opportunity with local retailers. In recent years, East African markets have turned tumultuous for both indigenous and international retailers. Uchumi, a Nairobi Securities Exchange-listed retailer, exited Uganda and Tanzania last October after failing to break even five years after expanding in those markets. The subsidiaries were, in fact, draining the parent company in Kenya, which is laden with debt and facing challenges paying suppliers. Shoprite, a South African retail giant, sold its Tanzania outlets in 2014 and those in Uganda in 2015 to Nakumatt, and exited the regional markets on the back of poor performance and growing competition. The supermarket had been operating in Uganda for 15 years and Tanzania for 13 years. But, it’s the struggles at Nakumatt, which has all along seemed sound, that will raise most concerns. “The business doesn’t look good. Times are tough,” tweeted Victoria Odipo. “We could also say that the shoppers are emptying the shelves faster than tbe supermarkets can stock them. Great economy,” one Jamie tweeted. Botswana-based Choppies, which acquired a 75% stake in a family-owned Kenyan retailer, Ukwala reported a $2.7 million loss in the year to June 2016. Major supermarkets in Kenya are still family-owned but foreign operators such as Choppies, French-multinational, Carrefour and South Africa’s Game, a brand of MassMart have since opened outlets in the country.

StarTran's revised citywide bus schedule begins Nov. 1. Starting Tuesday Lincoln residents will be able to work later, shop later, visit friends later and still catch a bus home. Travelers also will be able to take a bus between downtown and the Lincoln Airport. StarTran’s new bus schedule -- with later service on almost every route, more efficient routing and more frequent service on some routes -- begins Nov. 1. Download PDF The Lincoln City Council added about $390,000 to StarTran's annual subsidy to help pay for five of the nine drivers added to accommodate the expanded service. The major improvements include the following. * Evening service on three routes -- South 13th Street, North 27th Street and O Street -- ending about 9:50. The majority of the other routes will end around 8 on weeknights. Just three routes -- West A, Gaslight and Sheridan -- will end at the traditional 6:30 p.m. * Increased frequency of service during the middle of the day, with every half-hour service on the three busiest routes -- South 13th, North 27th and O Street -- on weekdays. * New service to the airport and the northeast Wal-Mart, plus additional service to Southeast Community College. The revised schedules and routes also will make it easier for people transferring buses downtown, said StarTran Manager Mike Davis. There will be no more than a five-minute wait for riders with destinations in other parts of downtown. StarTran has also changed the routing system, pulling buses off neighborhood streets and putting most stops along arterial streets. The bus system will end the practice of allowing people to flag down a bus and will pick up passengers only at designated bus stops.  For the next month, bus service will be free and drivers will be reminding people about the logistics of the new routes if they show up at the wrong spot.

Starting Dec. 3, drivers will stick to the new schedule.  StarTran has been working for two years on the route changes, and about 300 people attended three open houses explaining the new system in September, Davis said.  StarTran has been installing new bus stop signs and will have all old signs removed by Tuesday. Each stop will also eventually have schedule information, so riders will know when the next bus is scheduled to arrive, Davis said.   The changes came out of a $193,000 study on the city's bus system. Reach the writer at 402-473-7250 or nhicks@journalstar.com.  On Twitter @LJSNancyHicks. First Friday celebration To celebrate its new routes, StarTran is offering free bus rides and prize drawings during the First Friday Art Walk this week. From 6 to 8 p.m. the Star Shuttle will provide riders with a warm, quick way to visit all downtown galleries. In addition, KFRX-FM will broadcast live from Tower Square, where The Coffee House will provide free coffee and cookies. Everyone who rides the bus on First Friday can enter the drawing for gift cards to businesses including Cultiva, SouthPointe, Barry's, The Coffee House and CycleWorks, and Husker gear.

 BT CEO: 'It's possible that 80% of the jobs people do today won't exist in the future' Oscar Williams-Grut Oct. 29, 2016, 4:24 AM 7,291 facebook linkedin twitter email print BT CEO Gavin Patterson. Scott Olson/Getty Images The CEO of BT thinks the global jobs market is on "the cusp of a radical transformation." Speaking at the second annual HSBC Innovation Summit in London on Friday, Gavin Patterson said: "It's a combination of ubiquitous networks, ubiquitous data, ubiquitous processing capabilities, sensors in everything, augmented reality, virtual reality — the future looks very, very different. "Frankly, it's quite possible that 80% of the jobs that people do today won't exist in the future. It's not quite clear where we go from here." This is a big claim coming from a man whose company employees over 80,000 people. Stuart Gulliver, the CEO of HSBC, agreed with Patterson's point. HSBC employees over 265,000 people globally. Gulliver, who was on the panel with Patterson, said: "It's unlikely that there will be the same number of jobs in today's skill set in five years time." The World Economic Forum claims the world is on the cusp of the "Fourth Industrial Revolution," caused by the rise of robots and artificial intelligence. WEF estimates that these technologies could potentially put 5 million people out of work by 2020. A joint study by Citi and Oxford University earlier this year estimated that an incredible 77% of jobs in China could be at risk of automation, while the figure stands at 57% of jobs across the OECD. Foxconn, Walmart, and the US Department of Defence — 3 of the world's top 10 employers — have also already begun replacing manufacturing, warehouse, and combat roles with robots. But Gulliver added that the fact that certain jobs could be replaced by robotics and advanced computing would not necessarily mean that fewer people would be in work. He told the audience: "There may be new jobs that emerge and our responsibility is to manage that transition." Patterson told the audience that BT has a technology scouting network across Silicon Valley, London, Israel, and Berlin to keep the company abreast of the latest technological developments. HSBC's Gulliver said: "People of my kids' age don't expect to work 35 years for the same company in the same sector. Actually, again, you shouldn't think about this in terms of how can offer someone a 35-year career when they're aged 22 leaving university. That isn't what the person aged 22 wants anyway." However, Patterson caveated his jobs predictions by saying: "One of the things about looking into the future is you can look one or two years in the future but looking ten in advance is really very hard."

Tese, Mary Angelella James Halpin / Published: October 29, 2016 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     Hart   WILKES-BARRE — The arson trial against the son of the Wilkes-Barre Township fire chief ended in a mistrial Friday evening after the jury reported it was hopelessly deadlocked on a verdict. After about five hours of deliberations, the jury of 10 women and two men could not agree on whether 19-year-old Richard Hart was guilty on charges of arson, reckless burning and burglary. Luzerne County Judge David W. Lupas declared a mistrial. A smiling Hart declined to comment as he left the courthouse surrounded by family. Assistant District Attorney Thomas Hogans said he intends to re-prosecute the case. The charges stemmed from a fire that broke out early the morning of Dec. 21, destroying a vacant home at 115 Casey Ave. Police quickly identified Hart, a member of the township fire company and son of fire Chief Richard Hart, as a suspect based on his behavior after responding to fight the fire, including a comment he made about its origin point. Hart initially denied responsibility for the blaze, but in a subsequent interview he claimed he set it after following a cat into the vacant house, accidentally kicking over a can of gasoline and then dropping a lit cigar. On the stand Friday, Hart testified that he falsely confessed because he was “scared and nervous” after repeated police interrogations. “I was 18 years old. I never had to deal with anything like this before. I was nervous,” Hart said. “I thought if I’d tell them a story they would leave me alone.” Hart testified that he was with a friend at his home the night of the fire and that they ordered a pizza at 1:18 a.m. Hart then decided to walk down to McDonald’s on Wilkes-Barre Township Boulevard to get an iced coffee but returned after learning it was closed, he said on direct questioning. By the time he got back home five or 10 minutes later, the pizza had been delivered and he ate a slice before falling asleep on the couch, Hart said. About 3:15 a.m., he awoke to pagers for the fire and responded to the blaze along with his father, he said. Hogans, however, sought to cast doubt on Hart’s changing story, noting that when he showed up for a fourth interview with police he denied setting the fire and instead claimed to have seen a suspicious man following him and a friend the night of the fire. But the friend — who claimed to have been with Hart almost the entire night — testified he didn’t see any such character, and Hogans noted that despite allegedly seeing a suspicious character loitering in the neighborhood, Hart still decided to leave the house minutes later for a McDonald’s run by himself. “If you were that scared why would you chance it?” Hogans asked. “Because I wanted a coffee,” Hart said. During cross-examination, Hart maintained he never made it to McDonald’s because the man pulled a gun on him and told him to get out of the area. Yet Hogans noted that he failed to mention it to anyone — including to his best friend when he got back home — until after he recanted his confession. The defense rested its case with Hart’s departure from the stand. During closing arguments, defense attorney John Pike told the jury that Hart, a high-school dropout who worked at Wal-Mart, was manipulated into giving a confession by police with decades of experience and training in eliciting admissions from suspects. “He broke,” Pike said. “He’s an 18-year-old dropout in a room alone with lions.” Hogans urged the jury to use common sense during their deliberations and to consider whether Hart would logically have left his house to get coffee right before bedtime, only minutes after seeing a suspicious man lurking behind cars on the street. Hart’s story falls apart because of numerous inconsistencies, including that he failed to tell anyone about the suspicious man until a month after the fire, he said. “It doesn’t make any sense at all,” Hogans said. After the case was declared a mistrial, Pike said he was happy with the outcome of the case, which allowed Hart to remain free on bail. The case, he said, came down to Hart’s statements. “The issue as I saw it was obviously the alibi and reconciling that with his statement,” Pike said. “That’s what they apparently, I think, were struggling with.” One name that did not come up during the final day of the trial was former township fire Chief John Yuknavich. A day earlier, Pike noted that Hart at one point alleged Yuknavich, a rival of his father’s, was trying to set him up. Yuknavich, who served six months in federal prison for stealing about $45,000 from the department, is currently facing harassment charges alleging he was “verbally harassing” the new chief during the Giant’s Despair Hill Climb in July. Yuknavich denies any involvement in the case and threatened legal action against his accusers when asked about the allegations Thursday evening. He arrived at the courthouse Friday morning, offering to testify for the prosecution as a rebuttal witness but was not called. After the case ended, Pike said he didn’t know whether Yuknavich was involved in the case. “That was something that we were looking at. The testimony was out there,” Pike said. “There was evidence to support that there was somebody else behind what was going on with my client.”     570-821-2058, @cvjimhalpin We welcome user discussion on our site, under the following guidelines: To comment you must first create a profile and sign-in with a verified DISQUS account or social network ID.

At some point, my cereal consumption could almost be measured at an hourly basis. I have always considered taste, texture, and milk-to-cereal ratios apart of the art of eating cereal. It took until the ripe maturity of ten years of age to be able to carry the milk gallon from the fridge to the counter with ease, though I think I was actually thirteen-ish when I could finally carry it with one hand. Before then, my younger brother and I were completely dependent upon my mom making cereal for us. And thanks to her, we learned to drown our cereal in milk and mix cereals when two boxes became too low to make an entire bowl. But she and my father both worked multiple jobs to keep food on the table, so the task typically fell into my older brother’s hands. We’d ask him to make us cereal, and sometimes he would decline the request. But when he accepted, Blake and I had a little choreographed number, catchily entitled “The Cereal Dance,” that we’d perform. While Scott stood on the counter and carelessly poured cereal and milk into three bowls, Blake and I rubbed our hands over our eyes and lifted our knees up like the Soggybottom Boys, making a 360-degree rotation while squealing in bouts of anxiety. Nowadays, neither my parents nor brothers are around often enough to eat cereal with me. But when my brothers and I do get together, cereal is the one love we know we all have in common. We head straight to the grocery store for two boxes of cereal and a gallon of whole milk to accompany a list of Adam Sandler comedies and our parents’ deep-seated couches. But we always face the same problem when arriving at the cereal aisle and picking our victims for the night: where did all the good cereal go? And I’m not talking good like Cheerios, Special K, and Kashi. No, I’m talking about Waffle Crisp, Rice Krispie Treats, and French Toast Crunch. The sugary goodness that is the building block of our childhood. Nights dedicated to this topic with my fellow Cerealeans have yielded nothing but frustration and unsatisfied hunger. But the internet has given these cereals of our childhood another chance at life (or death?) so that we might live out our youth for a little bit longer. Waffle Crisp This cereal may or may not have dictated my priorities in life at one point. They were mini-waffles that were more crispy than crunchy, and got extremely soggy after five minutes of being in the bowl. This is why and how I learned to eat cereal quickly — because there are only a couple of cereals in this world that are better soggy, and they involve the Flintstone’s. Waffle Crisp’s mascot, at its peak of tastiness, was a group of elderly women who slaved over the making of Waffle Crisp. So you know they tasted the way Grandma would make ‘em. She wouldn’t worry about the sugars or the calories. And that’s exactly how Waffle Crisp tasted. They smelled like syrup and brown sugar. They tasted more like that than a buttery waffle. And the milk turned a light beige and tasted almost like the smell of cinnamon rolls. Waffle Crisp actually has not been discontinued yet. For some reason, Post cereal has just drastically reduced its production of it. I found it once in a North Georgia Ingles. I was dizzy with excitement and hope for the future of Waffle Crisp. Over the years, Kellogg’s Eggo Cereal took Waffle Crisp’s spot in major grocery stores. The upsetting part about Crisp’s competition is that it really isn’t the same. It’s like drinking skim milk after having whole milk for ten years. There’s less sugar, less texture, and the Eggo’s are thinner. They pale in comparison. But fear not, the Waffle Crisp market on the internet is vast, affordable, and easy to find. Rice Krispie Treat… the cereal edition Okay, so Kellogg’s got it right when they decided to give RKTC a chance. It first appeared in 1993 and judging by the profits Kellogg’s got by my family alone, I’m pretty sure it had no problem selling. But over the years, it vanished, and is also in limbo with Waffle Crisp… not officially discontinued, but also not easily found at any grocery store. However, when I was seventeen or so, Kellogg’s pushed it for a limited time in numerous major grocery stores. I literally gave money to someone from work, while I was on shift, to run over to Wal-Mart and buy three boxes for me. It might’ve made me a candidate for sainthood in my brothers’ eyes. RKTC is portioned off pieces of Rice Krispie Treats that are dry enough to avoid the goop of fresh, homemade Rice Krispie Treats, but sweet and frosted enough to rule out the sweetness of Frosted Cheerios, Frosted Flakes, and Frosted Wheaties combined. RKTC cannot be found on the shelves anymore, though I hope Kellogg’s goes for another push with them, but there are options for the RKTC addict: 1.) The internet 2.) Making Rice Krispie Treats and allowing them to set at room temperature for three days. At that time, they are dry enough to put in milk and enjoy, and you actually have control over what goes into the making of the RKTC. French Toast Crunch French Toast Crunch had a shelf life from 1995 to 2008. Apart of the Cinnamon Toast Crunch family, it took on the approach of the Crisp family (Cookie Crisp, Waffle Crisp) in that the cereal itself was shaped as small pieces of french toast. These crunchy delicacies had the ability of staying in milk for a rather long period of time without getting soggy. But when General Mills decided to make French Toast Crunch look the as Cinnamon Toast Crunch, sales plummeted… at least in my household. The flakes didn’t carry the same flavor. They actually seemed even more sugary, with a brown sugar coating, and lost the imitational taste of french toast. Along with losing the taste, they lost their texture, getting soggy at a much quicker rate. Though Cinnamon Toast Crunch is and was another favorite, the problem with this change was that General Mills lost its FTC market. And subsequently stopped manufacturing the cereal. Which is probably the biggest blow to my childhood taste buds. Although all of these cereals lost their spotlight, they never lost their following. Many blog posts and discussions from kids of the 90’s era are dedicated to the understanding of the shelf life of perfectly perfect cereals and their disappearance. It leads me to ask one thing: if the market remains, why not give these cereals another chance? Though that question may never be answered or fulfilled, there is one thing I can promise. If it does happen, I will not hesitate to do the cereal dance once more. What's your reaction?

In fact, the median amount owed on a credit card is $2,000, found GOBankingRates.com’s 2016 U.S. Household Debt survey. If you’re one of these people carrying a high balance on your card, you’re probably racking up interest charges. So, as your credit card issuer is making money off the interest and fees you have to pay, you’re losing more and more of your hard-earned cash. But there’s a smart way you can pay off your credit card debt: Make your credit card work for you. Sure, swiping your card everywhere you go won’t get you rich quick. But when you use your credit cards strategically, you can generate some cash for payments. Or, if you’re debt-free, you can use the extra funds to pay for an upcoming trip or that flat-screen TV you’ve always wanted. Here are seven creative ways you can make money with your credit cards. 1. Get Money With Cash-Back Credit Cards To make money using credit cards, get a card that pays you to shop. This type of card is called a cash-back credit card. Depending on the type of card you get, you can earn 1 percent or even 5 percent in cash-back rewards for certain purchases. Take the Discover it card, for example. Ranked: Best Cash-Back Credit Cards of All Time With this credit card, you can earn 5 percent cash back in rotating categories — such as gas, restaurants and more — on up to $1,500 in purchases every quarter. So let’s say you spend $1,500 on qualifying purchases — that’s $75 going right back into your pocket. And in addition to 5 percent cash back, you get 1 percent unlimited cash back on all other purchases. This card also offers a rare perk: Discover matches dollar-for-dollar all of the cash back you earn in your first year, which can add up quickly. The more you use a cash-back credit card, the more cash you can earn. Be careful, though. Pay off your credit card balance in full every month to avoid racking up credit card debt and paying high interest charges. If you fall too deep into debt, the cash-back rewards might not be worth it. Syda Productions / Shutterstock.com 2. Earn Bonus Rewards Points “The best way to leverage credit cards for money, in my experience, is to open a new card with a large flight mileage bonus, and use the points toward a free or heavily discounted flight,” said Stacy Caprio, search marketing manager at TimePayment, which provides equipment financing for businesses. You can take your pick of credit cards offering sign-up bonus points. For example, the Chase Sapphire Preferred credit card — named one of the best travel rewards credit offers by GOBankingRates — lets you earn 50,000 bonus points after spending $4,000 in purchases with the card in the first three months after opening an account. That’s the equivalent of $625 you can use toward travel. So, you might want to use this card, or similar rewards cards, for as many expenses as possible. And if possible, see if you can rack up rewards points by using your credit card to pay your rent. “It’s common knowledge that the best way of getting value — or money — back from credit card use is earning points,” said Roman Shteyn, co-founder of RewardExpert.com, which helps travelers make the most out of their credit card points and airline miles. “However, oftentimes people are not charging one of their biggest monthly expenses to their cards: their rent.” 3. Invest Your Cash Back You can also put cash-back rewards to work for you and invest the money — even if you earn less than a few hundred dollars. Thanks to the power of compounding interest, your cash-back rewards will grow into a sizable nest egg over time. Let’s say you earn $300 in cash back every year. If you invest that $300 into an account that earns 7 percent interest annually, in 10 years your balance will grow to more than $4,000. As an added credit card benefit, some rewards credit cards allow card owners to link their cards to eligible investment accounts. Take the Fidelity Rewards Visa Signature credit card: You can earn unlimited 2 percent cash and have those rewards automatically deposited into an eligible Fidelity account, such as a brokerage account, a 529 college savings plan, a retirement account and more. To maximize your investment earnings, look for credit cards with no restrictive categories. The more restrictions, the fewer opportunities to cash in and invest your rewards. 4. Sell Your Rewards Points — But Be Careful Travel rewards credit cards are a godsend if you’re a frequent traveler. But what if you don’t travel often? Shteyn suggested selling your points for money by booking tickets for friends and family with points in exchange for cash. “It can be a win-win for both parties,” he said. “Your friends get a discounted ticket, and you get cash back at a higher rate than your bank may offer.” But, before you get too excited and start selling your unwanted rewards for cash, know the risks. Although some rewards programs allow members to gift rewards or points to their family and friends, selling these perks for cash might violate the terms and conditions of some programs. So before you sell, carefully read your credit card rewards’ terms and conditions thoroughly — and make sure the process is not illegal in your state.

Do Your Shopping Online As a credit card benefit, some cards allow you to earn cash back or points by shopping online. You might need to log into your credit card account in order to access these savings and take advantage of the deals. For example, eligible Discover card members can earn additional cash back when they shop through Discover Deals. This includes 5 percent cash back when they shop LivingSocial, Apple, Walmart and other online retailers. They can also score gift cards, like a $25 Sam’s Club gift card, or savings off their next purchases. Other credit card issuers have similar shopping portals. Whichever shopping portal you use, read the terms and conditions and fully understand how the program works. Antonio Guillem / Shutterstock.com 6. Join Acorns and Link a Credit Card If you want to invest but don’t know where to begin, the Acorns app might be an excellent starting point. This investing platform automatically invests your spare change from everyday purchases. Simply sign up, and link your credit card or debit card. For every purchase you make, Acorns rounds up your purchases to the nearest dollar and invests the difference, turning your spare change into income. Your funds are invested in a diversified portfolio to lower your risk, and you can link as many credit cards as you like. The amount you can potentially earn through the app depends on how often you use a linked credit card. There’s a $1 monthly fee for using the service. But if you’re a college student with a valid “.edu” email address, you can use Acorns fee-free for up to four years. Andrey_Kuzmin / Shutterstock.com 7. Get Creative With Expired Credit Cards You can’t make a purchase with an expired credit card — but you can turn the card into art and cash in. This is probably a foreign concept, but some DIY-ers are exploring their crafty side and making handmade jewelry using expired credit cards. The profit you can generate from selling these unique fashion pieces vary. But if you’re interested, there are credit card accessories on Etsy.com selling for as little as $5 and as high as $20. Since the credit cards are cut into tiny pieces, the chance of someone piecing the card together and getting their hands on your card number is unlikely. Still, it’s safer to err on the side of caution. Don’t use too many pieces of the same credit card for one piece of jewelry. Credit cards can get you into financial trouble if you don’t keep a close eye on spending. But if you use them to your advantage, you can get free cash from everyday purchases and use these earnings to pay down debt.

The man said he was standing outside of his Myers Park home when he got into an argument with a neighbor. According to the report, "the argument turned into a physical altercation when the victim stated that the suspect threw a large pumpkin that struck him on the left side of his torso." The suspect then drove off in their car. The man suffered minor injuries, including a bruised ego, but did not need medical attention. Don't Start Shit There are worse things to be hit with during an argument than a pumpkin, as one woman learned in east Charlotte last week. The woman told officers that she was arguing with someone when the person suddenly threw a cat's litter box at her, striking her in the leg. The woman was not injured, although one could argue that, if the litterbox was full, that's a grievous injury in itself. Ummm What A 15-year-old boy apparently fell victim to some sort of fraud last week in east Charlotte. The kid apparently was ripped off for a pair of shoes, probably by someone on the internet, but the police report left more questions than answers. For those who are into translations, try your hand at this language, which is the CMPD's way of saying that a kid got catfished: "The victim stated that the listed suspect made a representation about a past or existing fact or a future event that is false and was calculated and intended to deceive, and the representation does in fact deceived (sic) the victim, and the suspect obtained the listed property." Sounds like when you've got a five-page paper due and two pages of ideas. These Don't Work A thief in the NoDa neighborhood was looking for a pharmaceutical rush last week, but was surely disappointed after checking his stash after the fact. A 23-year-old woman told officers that someone broke into her car and stole 20 pills in her prescription Adderall bottle. The thief wouldn't be getting much done by popping them, however, as the victim added that she had run out of her prescription and had filled the bottle with Advil in case of a headache. Jackpot An east Charlotte man who filed a police report after his home was broken into last week was clearly a foodie, as he felt it necessary to give the proper description of each food product the thief had walked out with. The 72-year-old man told officers that someone broke into his home in the Tanglewood neighborhood and stole 12 eggs, a spiral ham, four pounds of Bulgarian cheese, some domestic cheese, filo dough, 10 pounds of shrimp, candy bars and a batch of baker's chocolate. It's probable the man offered such descriptions in hopes police would find the food, but it's all the more probable that food was eaten within the hour. Shopping Spree A suspect was apparently playing their own game of Supermarket Sweeps at a Walmart in northwest Charlotte last week, although there were no cameras and employees weren't playing along. Management called police to report a shoplifter who had grabbed a seemingly random cache of items and made a dash for the door before being stopped by security officers. The suspect was caught with Budweiser beer (a staple in the average Walmart shoplifter's booty), paper towels, laundry detergent and a bag of dog food. The report was later updated after officers found that the man was also attempting to conceal a Citronella candle. We don't want to know where. Teary Eyed A student took things to the next level last week during a fight with another girl in the hallway at Mallard Creek High School. According to the police report, a female student assaulted a 17-year-old girl while the two were in a hallway walking to class. Following the fight, police seized a bottle of pepper spray from one of the students, but it's unclear whether she ever got a chance to use it. I'm sure the students standing nearby could tell you. I Deserve It While it's already rude to not tip those in charge of serving you food, one young customer at Five Guys at SouthPark Mall last week decided he would take it a step further. Apparently thinking that the service was so bad that he was owed a tip instead of obligated to give one, the kid simply reached in the tip cup and grabbed $25. Employees stopped the kid and called police, and the suspect was referred to a program for juvenile suspects. Threat of the Week A New York man recently showed his hand a little early during an argument with a woman living in Charlotte. The woman filed a report stating that the man called her and said, "I'm going to come burn your house down with you in it and nobody will know it was me because I live in New York." Safe to say, now that this threat is officially on the record, that's not such a great idea. Blotter items are chosen from the files of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department.

Dan Evon Oct 30, 2016 Share - - Claim: The Rothschild Family owns 80% of the world's wealth, with a net worth of $500 trillion. FALSE Origin:An old rumor was recirculated in October 2016, holding that the Rothschild Family is worth $500 trillion and holds more than 80% of the world's total wealth: While the Rothschilds are indeed very wealthy, claims about their net worth like the ones displayed above are grossly exaggerated. Conspiracy theories concerning the Rothschild family date back to the 18th century, and the family's wealth was largely responsible for the anti-semitic belief that "Jews control the world's money supply." The Rothschilds are frequently associated with theories about the Illuminati, the New World Order, and other dark money groups that supposedly pull the strings of world governments, and have been blamed for starting wars for personal gain, funding the Holocaust, and assassinating U.S. presidents. Skeptoid delved into the Rothschild family history in 2012, noting that: The greatest of these financial adepts was Mayer Amschel Rothschild, born in 1744 in a Jewish slum of Frankfurt. Not much is known about his early life, as his was one of tens of thousands of marginalized, outcast families. But once he came of age he became an apprentice at a small bank in Hamburg, where he learned the trade. Returning to Frankfurt at the age of 19, he offered his own banking services in a modest way, beginning with trading of rare coins and related investments. He was energetic, clever, and most of all he was charismatic. And he was smart, seeking out wealthy clientele, and associating with nobility whenever he could. By the age of 40, he had consolidated his most important business contact: the Landgrave William, the Elector of Hesse, one of only a tiny number of nobles empowered to elect the Holy Roman Emperor. When William was younger, he had engaged in the trading of rare coins with Mayer's father, and so the two had always known one another. When William inherited his own father's massive fortune, his friendship with Mayer Rothschild gave Mayer the ability to begin conducting larger international transactions. This was the point at which the Rothschild name became first involved with the manipulation of money behind the scenes of wars. Mayer was a firm believer in family business, and insisted on using his own sons — by then he had five — as his business partners. What he did next became the model for many powerful Jewish financiers who followed: He installed each of his five sons as his agents in the five major financial centers of Europe: the eldest Amschel Mayer Rothschild in Frankfurt, Salomon Mayer Rothschild in Vienna, Nathan Mayer Rothschild in London, Calmann Mayer Rothschild in Naples, and the youngest Jakob Mayer Rothschild in Paris. While the Rothschild family has amassed great wealth since the 1700s, claims that they have a net worth of $500 trillion or that they own 80% of the world's wealth are problematic. For one, the world's total wealth was estimated as of 2015 to be only $250 trillion, half of what the Rothchild's alone are claimed to possess: Global wealth reached 250 trillion US dollars in 2015, slightly less than a year earlier, due to adverse exchange rate movements. The underlying wealth trends do, however, generally remain positive, according to the Credit Suisse Research Institute's annual "Global Wealth Report." Also, the Rothschilds began acquiring their wealth in the 1700s, and since then the family has spawned hundreds of descendants, so there is no longer any centralized Rothschild family wealth. The closest thing to a "Rothschild Family" business in 2016 is the Rothschild Group, a multinational investment banking company, but that firm does not in itself generate nearly enough income to back up claims about the family's wealth. In 2015, the Rothschild Group's annual revenue was approximately $500 million. In comparison, the world's largest company, Walmart, has an annual revenue of nearly $500 billion. It should also be noted that only one member of the Rothschild family is included among Forbes' 2015 list of the world's billionaires: Benjamin de Rothschild, who was ranked at number #1121 with a net worth of $1.61 billion.  While the Rothschild family certainly were one of the world's most significant financial powers in centuries past, they no longer wield the same sort of influence over global affairs.

The issues and the divide between sides seem to be fairly conventional: Promises of jobs and economic growth motivate the pipeline's supporters. Its opponents cite environmental concerns (especially the prospective damage to tribal lands) and allege violations of the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851 in Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners' wheedling of land use permissions out of federal and state governments. On balance, the opponents seem to have a good case; the supporters not much of a case at all. For more than a century and a half the US government has selectively ignored its treaties with the Standing Rock Sioux and other tribes whenever those treaties threaten to stymie the plans of corporations with friends in government. Successfully holding Washington to its word this time might give the politicians and their cronies pause next time. And even if letting the US government use treaties as toilet paper just because it can wasn't an incredibly corrosive idea, keep in mind that it's not just the Sioux who are getting mugged. Private land owners all along the pipeline's 1,100 mile route are feeling the pain, too. Like Keystone XL before it, ETP leverages government's power of "eminent domain" -- under the pretense that the pipeline is some kind of public service rather than the private for-profit enterprise it actually is -- to steal much of the land required to complete Dakota Access. The go-to excuse among proponents of these "public/private partnership" type land thefts is always "jobs and economic development," but even if that excuse flew (it doesn't), it's a pretty poor one in this case. The $3.7 billion pipeline is advertised as creating a whopping 40 permanent jobs. I'm not sure how many people work at the average Wal-Mart, but it looks like more than 40 to me. How many jobs in agriculture and other sectors would Dakota Access destroy along the way? We have no way of knowing. - Advertisement - For me, the bottom line is this: If the only way to do something you want to do involves stealing other people's stuff, you shouldn't do it. And you certainly shouldn't get government help to do it. Dakota Access is the opposite of the American way. - Advertisement -   - Advertisement - 2   1   1   View Ratings | Rate It http://thegarrisoncenter.org Thomas L.

October generally marks the start of flu season and while it’s early, residents are encouraged to get flu shot to protect themselves and their loved ones. County health officials say it generally takes two weeks for the shot to build immunity to flu. “We’re not anticipating a shortage,” Matt Richardson, Denton County Public Health director, said of the flu vaccine. “I think we have plenty of vaccine on hand. “The good news is I’ve not heard of a shortage this year, and the vaccine appears to be a pretty good match, according to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and national data.” So far this flu season, the health department has administered about 2,000 flu vaccines, Richardson said. According to the CDC, more than 120 million doses of the seasonal flu vaccine has been distributed in the United States. The CDC recommends persons 6 months and older get an annual flu shot. The respiratory illness, which has symptoms including fever, cough, runny or stuffy nose, body aches and fatigue, is contagious, and if serious enough, could cause hospitalization or death. Those most at risk of complications of flu include children older than 5 and those younger than 2, pregnant women, adults 65 and older, people who live in long-term care facilities and nursing homes and people with chronic health conditions such as asthma, neurological conditions, heart disease, diabetes and cancer, according to health officials. Richardson said while a flu epidemic hasn’t hit yet, the county is expecting and preparing for it. The last several years, the flu season has peaked in Texas either between Christmas or New Year’s Day and the first couple months of the year, he said. Flu vaccines are available for eligible residents at Denton County Public Health clinics located at 535 S. Loop 288, Suite 1003 in Denton and at 401 N. Valley Parkway, Suite 100 in Lewisville. The vaccine is free to children who qualify for the Texas Vaccines for Children Program and uninsured adults. Shots are $20 for the general public, and while the county health clinics accept Children’s Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program and Medicare as payment, the clinics do not bill private health insurance. Residents can also receive flu shots from their physician’s office and pharmacies, including CVS, Walgreens, Wal-Mart, Albertson’s, Kroger and Target. The nearest location for obtaining a flu shot can be obtained by going to vaccinefinder.org. According to a CVS health survey released in August, 59 percent of Americans receive a flu shot annually or plan to get one this year.

Cruey / ORLANDO SENTINEL David Whitley David Whitley (Joshua C. Cruey / ORLANDO SENTINEL) David WhitleyContact ReporterOrlando Sentinel The phrase "Man Up" could be shamed out of the sports vocabulary At the risk of sounding like a man, I'm worried about the future of the M-word. My alarm is caused by Chico State, of all places. The California school's athletic department has started a campaign to stamp out potentially offensive phrases. There are videos and posters of Chico athletes next to captions like, "I don't say 'Coward' because you can't judge some else by your owns standards." It doesn't say whose standards are acceptable, but yours are not. I won't go off on an anti-PC rant because many of the offensive phrases the program cites really are offensive. But, as always, the Thought Police go too far. One poster reads, "I don't say 'Man Up' because it insinuates women can't be courageous." In the immortal words of Sgt. Hulka, "Lighten up, Francis." I suspect in the roughly 2.38 billion times the phrase has been used that nobody, not even Bobby Knight, thought it meant "Women can't be courageous." But the safe-space crowd thinks all gender-related phrases should be removed from polite society, especially ones that acknowledge the concept of masculinity.

Forgive me for quoting "The Elephant Man," which I suppose must now be renamed "The Elephant Person" lest some young athlete feel marginalized. But we'd better not stop there. The school librarian should take a Sharpie to a certain book and make it "The Old Person and the Sea." I'm losing my iPod until Apple Tunes comes out with "Sharp Dressed Person," "Macho Person," and, of course, "When a Person Loves a Woman." Hollywood better name the movie next sequel "Iron Person 4" since it doesn't want to insinuate women can't be iron-like. Hopefully the M-word shaming will be contained at Chico, though you know how crazy campuses are these days. The thought of Texas A&M fans becoming The 12th Person is a little depressing. Stuff the ballot The Magic's mascot, Stuff, was one of six finalists nominated last week for the Mascot Hall of Fame. Not only is the neon green dragon richly deserving of the honor, it is the only Magic employee past or present with a chance at a Hall of Fame. I strongly encourage you to go to www.mascothalloffame.com and vote for our furry friend. Chances are it will be the only vote you feel good about this year. Stuff the coach Speaking of fur, Vikings coach Mike Zimmer had it flying last week after he reportedly slashed the throats of stuffed animals to motivate his team. It turned out Zimmer was innocent, though somebody indeed took a knife to a few small, innocent animals. I hope PETSA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Stuffed Animals) calls for a boycott of Minnesota games until the NFL finds the culprit and suspends him for a game. Unless Tom Brady snuck in and did it, in which case the NFL will launch a $25 million investigation and kick him out of the league. Editor's note Chico State should not be confused with Chico-O-Stick, the crunchy peanut butter candy that sticks so hard to your teeth that you must person up to pry it off. Fountain of youth After 31-year-old LeBron James opened the season with a triple-double, Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue said doctors tested James in the offseason and said he has the body of a 19-year-old. In related news, doctors have determined Dwight Howard has the maturity of a 7-year-old. Pocket change Jim Harbaugh is America's highest-paid college football coach at $9,004,000 per year, USA Today reported last week. That's a $2 million raise over 2015. That'll buy a lot of khakis. Harbaugh used to wear the $8 model from Walmart (in case you're wondering, he could buy 1,125,050 pairs at his current salary). Michigan signed an apparel deal with Nike's Jordan brand in April. Harbaugh needed the raise because Jordan Icon pants go for $90 a pop. Either that, or he had to cover his new ObamaCare premium. Parting shots •Vikings Update: Minnesota dentist Walter Palmer has offered free braces to whoever slashed the throats of the stuffed animals. Cecil the Lion could not be reached for comment. •After the most recent post-race inspection, NASCAR doctors have determined Tony Stewart has the body of a 19-year-old éclair that was lost in the back of a pantry. •Fearing female fans might be insulted, Manchester United has announced it is changing its name to Personchester United. dwhitley@orlandosentinel.com Privacy Policy Copyright © 2016, Orlando Sentinel LeBron James Minnesota Vikings NFL Dwight Howard Tyronn Lue David Whitley Manchester United F.C.

But to the families of 10 young people in America — ranging from 9 to 19 years old — it will never be forgotten. It’s the date author Gary Younge randomly chose to put a spotlight on America’s gun violence in his new book “Another Day in the Death of America: A Chronicle of Ten Short Lives.” On an average day in America, seven children and teens will be shot to death, Younge notes.      OPINION Follow @MaryMitchellCST And on that November day in 2013, 10 children were killed. The young gunshot victims hailed from small towns like Grove City, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus, to urban centers like Chicago, where Younge lived for four years before returning to London in 2015. Five days before American families gathered to sit down together for Thanksgiving dinner, seven African Americans, two Hispanics and one white child were gunned down. Through exhaustive research and interviews with relatives, friends, teachers and others who had an intimate knowledge of the victims, Younge not only paints a detailed portrait of each of them but also of the communities that have allowed these deaths to happen. In a recent column, Younge, who writes for The Nation and is an editor-at-large for the London-based Guardian newspaper, says such a book wouldn’t be possible elsewhere. And he’s especially troubled by how often law enforcement labeled these shootings “gang-related.” The majority of the fatal shootings that occurred on Nov. 23, 2013 defied the stereotypes that most of us hold about gun violence. For instance, one youth was killed at a sleepover in a rural community. Another shooting was a case of mistaken identity. In Chicago, Tyshon Anderson, who had been released from prison a few days earlier, was killed in a stairwell in South Chicago. In Houston, 16-year-old Edwin Rajo, whose female best friend was a gang member, was fatally shot when she pulled the trigger during a game. She had gotten the gun after an altercation with a rival gang. “If a shooting can be described as ‘gang-related,” then it can also be discounted as part of the ‘pathology’ of urban life, particularly for people of color,” Younge argued in a recent column. “In reality, the main cause, pathologically speaking, is a legislative system that refuses to control the distribution of firearms, making America the only country in the world in which such a book would have been possible.” The stories of the 10 lost lives he presents are rich in detail. The author uses each death to delve into the complex issues driving gun violence — segregation, poverty, the lack of mental health resources. Younge is candid but compassionate. He avoids coming off looking as if he is exploiting these deaths. This isn’t a book that harps on gun control. Nor does it sugarcoat the family dynamics that might have played a role in these deaths. The story of Jaiden Dixon, who, at 9 years old, was the youngest to die that day, was particularly heartbreaking. The shooter was the estranged boyfriend of Jaiden’s mother and the father of Jaiden’s brother. He shot Jaiden in the head when the boy answered the doorbell. Younge described the shooter as an “amok man” whose rampage also included shooting another estranged girlfriend. Police ended up killing the man in a Wal-Mart parking lot in a nearby town. After each story, I had to exhale. We can continue to argue about what the Second Amendment means. But Younge makes it difficult to justify putting politics over children’s lives.

I tried Kroger's new grocery service, and I'm never buying food the old way again Hayley Peterson Oct. 29, 2016, 9:02 AM 92,093 facebook linkedin twitter email print I'm a huge fan of Kroger's ClickList.Business Insider/Hayley Peterson I just got a glimpse into the future of food shopping, and my life will never be the same again. Earlier this week I tried Kroger's ClickList, which lets you order groceries online and then pick them up at a store where employees load everything into your car. The service — known in the industry as click-and-collect — has been popular for years in the UK, but it has just started taking off in the US. Kroger started testing ClickList two years ago, and it recently started rolling out the service nationwide. ClickList is currently available at more than 500 stores, the company told Business Insider. I tried it at a location in Richmond, Virginia.  Other companies offering grocery pickup include Walmart, Harris Teeter, and soon Amazon. My friends have been raving about it, so I decided to give it a try.  Here's what it was like. View As: One Page Slides The ordering process was so simple. Business Insider/Hayley Peterson The site used my Kroger rewards number to populate the items I purchase most often. That made it really easy to start building my shopping list.  For other items, I used the search bar and found exactly what I was looking for in a matter of seconds. This saved me at least 20 minutes of criss-crossing the sprawling store in search of random ingredients.  And it was so easy to compare prices.  Gone are the days of wandering around the condiments aisle trying to pinpoint the cheapest ketchup or mustard brands in a sea of dozens of choices.    Once I placed my order, I selected a one-hour time slot to pick it up on the following day. Pickup times for this location run from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. and every time slot was available. Business Insider/Hayley Peterson When I arrived at the store, I noticed that eight parking spaces near the store's entrance had been turned into a ClickList pickup area. Business Insider/Hayley Peterson I parked in one of the ClickList spots and next to my window, I saw a sign instructing me to call a phone number to notify the store that I had arrived. Business Insider/Hayley Peterson I called the number and an employee answered the phone on the first ring. He asked for my name and told me he would deliver my groceries in a few minutes. Five minutes later, an employee walked up to my car window and introduced himself as Morgan. Business Insider/Hayley Peterson Out of my order of 24 items, the store didn't have two items in stock in the brands that I had selected, he said. So he substituted those products with comparable brands that were the same price. He showed me the items he had substituted to make sure I approved of his selections.  He swiped my credit card using a tablet and gave me a receipt for my order. Business Insider/Hayley Peterson Then he started loading my car with grocery bags. Business Insider/Hayley Peterson Once he finished, I decided to run into the store to grab some flowers.  This is a huge advantage of ClickList over grocery delivery services that I have used in the past. With click-and-collect, you can still enjoy the benefits of a brick-and-mortar store without having to spend an hour wandering the aisles inside. So if you like to pick out your own produce, for example, or if you realize you forgot something on your list, you can make a quick trip into the store to grab those items since you are already on site to pick up your online order. Within 10 minutes of my arrival, I had a trunk full of groceries that will last me more than a week. Normally, this shopping trip would have taken me about an hour. Business Insider/Hayley Peterson ClickList was ridiculously easy and seamless, and now I can't imagine buying groceries any other way. Of course, this kind of convenience doesn't come without a price. ClickList costs $4.95 per order. For your first three orders, the service is free.

Old problems. New solutions. Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz high school in Puebla, Mexico. Whitney Eulich | Caption Mexico's new push to improve schools: Get parents involved Bridging the Gap Working together Parent involvement hasn't traditionally been part of the culture of education in Mexico. Now, programs are emerging to change that, with encouraging results. Whitney Eulich @weulich October 29, 2016 Mexico City—Luis Reynoso, a father of two, says he’s always tried to get involved in his children’s education: attending meetings on school-improvement projects and pitching in to provide classroom snacks. But when his youngest daughter’s elementary school invited families to attend a nine-week pilot program to learn about parenting and school participation, he realized his past efforts barely scratched the surface. “The workshops really woke me up,” says Mr. Reynoso about Let’s Change the Course, organized by Mexicanos Primero, a leading education advocacy group here. Each weekly session touched on different parenting themes ranging from the concrete – like setting up a dedicated space at home for kids to do homework – to the less tangible, like the importance of self-esteem. Join EqualEd! The latest news straight to your inbox. “I realized there’s a lot more I can be doing for her education that will make an even bigger difference, like helping motivate her or having an adult home when she’s back from school or making time to read together,” Reynoso says. One of the most helpful sessions, he recalls, focused on what a child should know academically in each grade and how to talk to teachers about his daughter’s performance. Levels of parental participation in Mexican schools have long been low, experts say. Reasons range from commonly held beliefs that a child’s education is the school’s domain to few opportunities or tools to get involved beyond school cleanup. In some parts of the country, a mother's or father’s own lack of education can play into a sense that they have nothing to contribute. And even in private schools, where there might be more adults with professional careers, participation often lags, with some parents viewing their tuition bill as their educational contribution. There are also cases where the schools themselves see parents more as a complaining nuisance than a potential partner in a child’s education, discouraging communication between families and schools. But parent involvement is key to student – and school – success. A 2012 study of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries found that promoting higher levels of parental involvement can increase student performance, as well as helping reduce performance gaps across socioeconomic sectors. The importance of family participation is something many nonprofits, education advocates – and recently the federal government – are starting to home in on in Mexico. Part of Mexico’s 2013 national education reform underscores the importance of parents playing a more active role in their child’s education, encouraging a boost in parental-participation programs. And independently, programs are emerging, including Let’s Change the Course, which is ramping up from 420 families in low-income schools in the capital and Mexico State to roughly 1,200 families this academic year. Emerging charter schools require parents, students, and teachers to sign a pact agreeing to concrete ways they will work together. And there’s also a social enterprise that uses art to spark discussions among parents about what it means to be a “good” mother or father both in and outside the classroom. “The culture is slowly changing,” says Susana Castellanos, principal of Manuel C. Tello elementary school in Mexico City, which participated in the pilot program last year. “People are recognizing you have to work together to create happy, successful citizens,” she says. “It’s no longer acceptable to isolate the roles of teacher vs. parent vs. school principal.” 'How can I help my kid more?' Lines of kids run up and down the concrete yard at the Ricardo Flores Magnon elementary school on a recent afternoon, tossing balls into the air and clapping twice before catching them again. Mallinaly Santiago says she signed up for the program last year because she wanted to learn how to improve her second-grade daughter Dana’s behavior and get closer to her teacher. “The first two sessions I wasn’t convinced. But then I realized I was actually learning a lot. The workshop changed me and as a result, we have all seen changes in Dana,” says Ms. Santiago, who works at a nearby day care center. “I learned ways to listen to my daughter so that I could understand her and respond better,” she says. “I learned how to set limits at home and techniques to not get frustrated as easily.” Although the sessions were aimed at parents, teachers say they gain a lot when families get involved. Susana Valesca (left) and her mentor Mineko Matsumoto. They met three years ago at a public high school in San Pedro Cholula, Mexico. Mineko was teaching there as part of Enseña Por Mexico, a program modeled after Teach for America. Whitney Eulich | Caption “Parents that participated tried to get a lot closer to me [after the workshops]. They would come and ask, ‘How can I help my kid more,’ ” says Janeth Valencia, a third grade teacher at Manuel C. Tello elementary. “They are the ones who can reinforce what is taught inside the classroom back at home. When support is constant between school and home, everything changes.” Just because parents in Mexico have traditionally left education up to teachers doesn’t mean that they don’t want to be involved, says Manuel Bravo, co-director of family and teacher participation at Mexicanos Primero. And given decades of corrupt practices by Mexico’s powerful teachers union – where positions were sometimes bequeathed from parent to child and in some cases teachers collected paychecks without showing up to class – an increase in parental involvement is key to accountability. “The education system in Mexico offers basically two instances for parents to get involved. Councils that meet once every [four months], where parents and teachers make decisions about the school [budget], and parent associations,” that help plan holiday parties or other events, Mr. Bravo says. Help us change the future We're challenging our readers to become mentors in their local communities. Find out how one caring person can change the course of a young person's life, and see where you can take part today. LEARN MORE Participation in school councils can be so low, it reaches zero in some states, including Michoacán and Mexico, according to the 2016 state Index of Fulfillment of Educational Responsibility report, published by Mexicanos Primero. “The education system says that parents don’t want to participate,” Bravo says. “But what we found in these workshops is that they don’t want to participate with the current channels of communication. If we create opportunities to learn [how to] become better parents, they will show up,” he says, pointing to the 84 percent retention rate of participants in the pilot program. Parents and teachers as allies, not adversaries Ana Angelica Chenzi Segura took over as elementary school principal at Ricardo Flores Magnon last year, one of Mexico’s few schools that runs from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., instead of just four hours. At first, she says she was frustrated by some of the conversations she had with parents. “Mothers would come by and ask for a spot in the school: ‘I work, I need a place for my kid,’ ” Ms. Chenzi says. “No one said ‘I want a better education for my child. I want him to study more.’ It made me feel like this school was a Walmart bag drop – Just bring the child and leave it.” She tells parents who say they are too tired after work to think about their child’s school day, “You don’t have to teach him or her. But you have to provide the space, time, and material to study. Provide the consistency so that kids know this is the hour and the place for homework,” she says. La Vaca Independiente, an organization focused on education innovation in Mexico, trains teachers to serve as moderators to help spark discussions among parents. The sessions rely on fine art and photography to create conversations about what it means to be a parent and how to help children move ahead. “As a teacher, you only have a few hours a week with your students – it’s hard to create an impact. But if you align with a parent that sees the child every night you can create a much bigger change,” says Gabriela Bloise, a trainer who previously implemented these workshops in her own classroom as a high school teacher in Puebla State. “Schools often don’t want to open up their doors to parents, and parents don’t approach the schools,” says Bloise. “It’s a challenge. But slowly, we’re building that bridge.”  Next Up Test your knowledge 1912 eighth grade exam: Could you make it to high school in 1912?

It unveiled the Amazon Prime membership program for the country Friday. The program will cost 388 yuan ($57) for Chinese customers, which is cheaper than the $99 membership it offers in the U.S. But it will also offer fewer services — Prime music and video streaming services are not included in the membership. Instead, it would provide customers free shipping on orders above 200 yuan. Amazon has struggled in the country despite its global market presence and one of the largest product catalogues in the world. It has only between 1 percent and 3 percent of the Chinese e-commerce market share despite being present in the country since 2006.

Another e-commerce site, JD.com, has a market cap of $36 billion in China and is backed by Walmart. Amazon recently vowed to invest $3 billion in the Indian e-commerce market, but it is China that CEO Jeff Bezos considers his "meta-mission."

Every October, the staff at US Healthcare Supply come together as a team to raise money and awareness for breast cancer research, and this October was no exception.  Over the past five years, US Healthcare Supply, located in Milford, has organized annual company events to raise money for breast cancer research through various fundraising initiatives, such as, employee bake sales, tricky trays and raffles.  Local merchants in Milford also got involved and supported the cause with donations.  This has been our most successful year to date, and we doubled the amount of money we raised from last year. Each year, Jon P. Letko, chief executive officer and president of US Healthcare Supply matches every dollar that is raised during the fundraiser and this year the total raised was over $10,000.   US Healthcare Supply will continue efforts to raise money and awareness for breast cancer research. This devastating disease impacts so many. According to the National Breast Cancer Association, it is estimated that 1 woman will be diagnosed with breast cancer every 2 minutes. That equates to 246,000 women in the United States will be diagnosed per year.  That's an alarming statistic and it's one that impacts Letko. At a young age, Letko lost his mother to breast cancer. In her honor, the Letko family has joined in the fight against this disease in the hopes of one day finding a cure. US Healthcare Supply donates all of the proceeds they collect to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. This organization uses 91 cents of every dollar donated toward funding cancer research and awareness programs. To date, US Healthcare Supply has raised $27,405.56 for breast cancer research.   US Healthcare Supply would like to thank their staff, as well as the merchants in Milford, for the incredible amount of support they received for this event.  Special thanks to Walmart, Phillipsburg, ShopRite of Greenwich and Dunkin Donuts for generously donating prizes, treats and decorations. The Letko family and staff at US Healthcare appreciate all the generous donations received for the fight against breast cancer and look forward to make next year's Think Pink event an even greater success.

Supplies for making cards will be provided and the public is invited to attend. Cards may be dropped off or mailed to the Hancock County Red Cross office, 125 Fair St. Findlay OH 45840, until Nov. 18. Cards and gift package items also may be dropped off by Nov. 18 at Curves and A&A Grocery in Upper Sandusky. Individuals are asked to refrain from sending letters, monetary donations or any other inserts with the cards and from using glitter. The American Red Cross Holiday For Heroes program is an annual campaign that lets the community send messages of appreciation and holiday cheer to service members, veterans and military families. North Central Ohio Chapter Executive Director Todd James said the program is easy to participate in. “Whether you make a card or buy a card, it just takes a moment to sign it and share your appreciation for the sacrifices made by members of the military and veteran community,” he said. Individuals, schools, businesses and organizations are encouraged to participate by collecting cards and delivering them to the Hancock County Red Cross office. As part of the Holiday For Heroes campaign, the Red Cross is collecting specific items to be distributed to armed forces personnel in Kuwait and Djibouti. Care packages will be assembled and sent to service members. “These are everyday items that we take for granted,” James said. “But for servicemen and women overseas, they mean a lot and can make their lives a little bit more comfortable. Sending these packages is an easy way to say thanks and happy holidays to those sacrificing so much for our freedom.” James said the list of items being collected comes straight from the troops. “The Red Cross has Service to the Armed Forces stations on these bases and our personnel who serve the troops provided a list of items that our brave men and women need and want,” he said. “That’s the list we are using to fill the care packages. Items needed include full-sized and travel-sized toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, lotion, toothpaste, body wash), feminine hygiene products, deodorant, body and foot powder, toothpaste, floss, tissues, shave gel (no aerosol cans), dice, books, board games, protein bars, candy, nuts, gum, beef sticks or jerky, cookies, crackers, toaster pastries, ramen, macaroni and cheese and heat and serve foods that come in their own serving bowls and just-add-water muffin, cake, cookie and bread mixes. Red Cross volunteers will be at the Tiffin Avenue and Trenton Avenue Walmart stores in Findlay from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Nov. 5 to collect donated items for the care packages. Volunteers will be outside the store’s entrances with fliers listing the items needed. The deadline for collecting the items is Nov. 18. “That gives us enough time to pack the boxes and get them in the mail, so they arrive overseas in time for the holiday season,” James said.

For over a month, Winegardner, 38, and her 20-year-old son have been living at the Harmony House, 124 W. Third St., with roughly 60 other men, women and children who need help getting back on their feet. "I was crying. I was sad. I was scared to come here, but it is a very nice place. This place is a very big blessing," Winegardner said on Oct. 25. Buy Photo Amber Winegardner  (Photo: Lou Whitmire/News Journal) The divorced mother of four, who grew up in northern Richland County, said she was living with mother and it did not work out. She currently shares a room with other women. Her son is downstairs in the men's shelter. Harmony House, through a United Way grant, was able to get her son a birth certificate and state identification card. She is not on drugs, she said. "It's just a hiccup in life." In fact, she already has a job at Edge Plastics. She walks to and from the homeless shelter to the factory, about two miles each way, where she works seven days a week. She also has completed some nursing classes and only needs to complete her clinicals to get an associate's degree. Winegardner is looking for a place to live and a vehicle, but said she isn't asking for a handout. "I need both, but the Lord will bless me," she said. Vicki Kane, executive director of Harmony House, 124 W. Third St., said the facility served 578 people in 2015. Last year Harmony House provided 14,416 nights of lodging, provided 43,272 meals and provided comprehensive case management to 578 people. In addition to shelter, the agency provides food and clothing, case management, workshops, after-school and summer programs for children, rent and deposit assistance, household items and furniture as available and six units of permanent housing. "We're staying busy," she said. "It is getting more and more difficult to assist people due to the economy and jobs not at livable wages. And people are really struggling. We get a lot of calls from people who maybe do not need to come in here, but need assistance, food, diapers, formula," Kane said. She said there is an increasing number of homeless in Richland County, with people sleeping on benches downtown or at the Richland Mall in Ontario. She said often law enforcement officers bring people with no place to stay to Harmony House, or they are referred to the homeless shelter by the Domestic Violence Shelter or the hospital. With 27 years working at the Harmony House come January, Kane said the facility, which opened in 1990, is seeing increased numbers of homeless and people with greater needs. "About a third of our clients are disabled, elderly," she said. "It's hardest dealing with the mentally ill." In Ohio, 11,167 people were homeless in 2015, according to the Coalition on Homelessness and Housing in Ohio. Angela Riley, the Harmony House's men's case manager, said she is seeing an increase in male clients ages 18 to 24. Clients stay at the Harmony House facility for up to 60 days Kane said it used to be 90 days, but the state wants it to be around 30 days now, despite the lack of income and resources. Transitional housing need Harmony House no longer offers transitional housing, but a local couple, Tony and Andrea Horning of Crestline, are working to open a Christ-based organization in Mansfield focused on transitional housing, workforce development and community enhancement in 2017. Crestline couple Tony and Andrea Horning are looking for a house in Mansfield to open up as Emannuel's Bread, a place for individuals and families needing help and transitional housing.  (Photo: Lou Whitmire/Mansfield) Although they have not yet secured a house, they plan to focus on displaced families who need help getting back on their feet for whatever reason. They are calling the nonprofit project Emmanuel's Bread. The Hornings have a seven-member, all-volunteer board and want to model their program after Habitat for Humanity in terms of people working at the house, helping with the cost of their stay and working toward future ownership of a house. They are searching for a house available through the Richland County Land Bank. The Hornings have developed many partnerships with companies and churches willing to help them help others in need. The Hornings attend Impact Worship Center in Bellville.
