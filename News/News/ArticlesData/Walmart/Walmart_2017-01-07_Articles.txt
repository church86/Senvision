CBS News reports that 26-year-old Timothy Black is accused of committing a vile crime at a Marietta Walmart store, involving more than one unsuspecting woman. Police say that Blake used a syringe to squirt his own semen at women as they shopped at his local Walmart store on more than one occasion. They say they first received a report of this bizarre behavior in early-November, from an unidentified female shopper who claimed he was being “creepy,” while hanging around her. The woman told police that she felt something “wet” on her back and foot while the man was behind her, which prompted her to run to a restroom to check herself. The unidentified woman told authorities that the substance was wet and sticky. When she emerged from the restroom, she claims that Timothy Blake was still present, and was watching her. Surveillance footage from the Marietta Walmart store reportedly compliments the woman’s claims. That’s not the only complaint being made against the Ohio man. On Dec. 28, authorities were given a similar account from another woman. Surveillance footage also went along with the claims she had made. That dude at Walmart who sprays his semen on you from a syringe. #WarningSignsOfACreephttps://t.co/5EqZNe8ABH — Saeger Ryman (@ezsaeger) January 5, 2017 Just before New Year’s Eve, Timothy Blake was arrested in association with the two disturbing incidents at Walmart. During an interrogation, the Ohio man initially admitted to squirting egg yolks at the two women. However, when police told him that they had “tested the substance,” Blake changed his story, and admitted that he had actually squirted semen at them. He reportedly admitted to using a syringe during the two reported incidents, but also admitted to using egg yolks and saliva in a syringe on separate, but similar, occasions. He has admitted to at least a dozen other occasions where women were stalked and squirted with bodily fluids and egg yolk. This isn’t the first time someone has been accused of squirting or smearing their bodily fluids on unsuspecting members of the public. Late last year, a Florida man was arrested after he reportedly poured semen on a woman at a Panera Bread restaurant. The Tallahassee Democrat reports that 28-year-old Patrick Bruce had entered the Panera Bread on Sept. 12, where he encountered the unidentified woman. The woman, who was eating with a friend, told authorities that the Florida man sat nearby and stared at her and her friend as they ate. The two women told police that he disappeared into a restroom, briefly, before coming back with a cup. The Florida man is accused of saying “here you go,” to the woman, as he flung the contents of the cup in her face — getting it on her neck, shoulders, and arm. The contents of the cup was later determined to be Patrick Bruce’s semen. Also last year, a Pennsylvania man was arrested after he allegedly squirted semen on a woman’s buttocks. The woman claimed that she was shopping in a Bethlehem grocery store at the time of the incident, but she followed him out of the store and took cellphone photos of him in order to identify him to police. Lehigh Valley News reports that 57-year-old Michael Kevin Morris was charged with two counts of indecent assault and a single charge of open lewdness. Teenage boys ‘mixed their semen into icing and served it to teacher’ https://t.co/E9Za8jZhTc — LadyRos (@LadyRos2) December 23, 2016 As for this latest case, Ohio man Timothy Blake has been charged with sexual imposition, menacing by stalking and pandering obscenity. He is currently being held in jail without bond. Meanwhile, reports have revealed that he is married, but his wife has been unaware of his alleged hobbies. Police have reported that the Ohio man blames his parents, for some reason, for the strange behavior he has exhibited.

The smiley face first appeared at a store in North Carolina in 1989 and then grew to be the face of the brand. "Whenever you'd walk in the door, the greeter would have a roll of smiley face stickers," said Savannah Lester, who stopped by the exhibit during a family outing. Nearly 30 years ago, Henry Jordan, a store manager in Whiteville, North Carolina, and his wife came up with the smiley face logo hoping to get more kids to come into the store. They printed "Wal-Mart Lil' Shopper" at the bottom of the stickers, and they turned out to be a hit. Walmart Founder Sam Walton wrote a letter to Jordan praising him for his bright idea and the retailer adopted the smiley face in its stores nationwide. The face eventually became the face of the savings customers could get at Walmart. Walmart plans to bring the savings symbol out of retirement this year. The museum exhibit will be on display until Jan. 31.

Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) Jan 7, 2017 at 6:44PM Image source: Getty Images. Since August 2010, the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI) have risen from below 10,000 to within a fraction of a point of 20,000. Doubling in just over six years is an impressive feat, especially given that the Dow also pays a respectable dividend yield of more than 2% on top of its rise. Yet although all 30 stocks that are currently in the Dow have risen over that period, some haven't done nearly as well as the overall average. In particular, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) have underperformed the Dow since 2010. Let's look more closely at these stocks and whether they can start pulling more of their weight in 2017 and beyond. ^DJI data by YCharts How a big-box giant lagged behind the Dow Wal-Mart hasn't exactly done badly over the past six years, rising 57%. Yet the retail giant has seen several big moves in both directions over that timeframe, and the state of its once-commanding big-box business is far from the colossus that long-term investors became familiar with throughout most of its history. Wal-Mart has faced numerous challenges that it hasn't yet entirely conquered. On one hand, the benefits that Wal-Mart gained during the financial crisis had started to peter out by 2010, and many shoppers started to prefer slightly more upscale retail establishments compared to the famous discount department store. On the other hand, competition from online retailers has only gotten fiercer during the 2010s, and the resulting negative pressure caused same-store sales slumps that lasted for years before finally reversing themselves. More recently, labor cost issues have played a role in holding back profit growth, and efforts to build up its e-commerce presence have met with only mixed success. To play a bigger role in the Dow, Wal-Mart will have to establish that its efforts to revamp stores and offer new services will keep it competitive with its retail peers. Big Blue gives shareholders the blues IBM has the longest pedigree of Dow membership of these three stocks, having joined the average in 1932. Throughout much of the second half of the 20th century, IBM was a key leader in the technology industry, creating the personal computer and helping to drive its widespread adoption across the globe both for businesses and consumer use. Even when the hardware arena became less specialized and more of a commodity business, IBM adapted by entering the software and services field to tap into higher margins. Yet returns have slowed, with just a 58% gain since late 2010. In recent years, IBM's efforts to reinvent itself have met with greater skepticism. The move toward cloud computing and data analytics has led IBM to make further changes, including its decision to sell off a key server business in 2014. With the company's Watson cognitive-computing system, IBM hopes to find a wide variety of applications for clients to use, ranging from offering better customer service to assisting healthcare professionals with diagnosis and treatment decisions. The key question for IBM is whether it can keep making progress quickly enough to keep up with nimbler competitors. If it can, then the stock's contribution to the Dow's upward movement could become more important in the future. This stock suffered a big breakdown Finally, Caterpillar has been one of the hardest-hit Dow stocks over the past six years. A huge rebound in 2016 brought its total return since late 2010 to nearly 70%, but as recently as early 2016, Caterpillar's performance was flat during the period. The main problem that Caterpillar has faced is an unprecedented confluence of bad industry conditions among its key customers. One by one, poor performance in construction, infrastructure, mining, and energy has conspired to hold Caterpillar back, and customers have been sluggish in replacing aging equipment and boosting capital spending to acquire new products. The prospects for better commodity prices in the future helped push the stock higher over the past year, and health in commodities will be the best opportunity for Caterpillar to keep regaining ground and make a bigger impression on the Dow in the future. Yet if global conditions deteriorate, then Caterpillar could start weighing on the Dow again, as it has throughout much of the past several years. The Dow has done well for investors with its double since 2010, but it's inevitable that not every stock will pull its weight. Looking forward, though, there are things that Caterpillar, IBM, and Wal-Mart can do to try to keep up more effectively with their Dow peers in 2017 and beyond.

File photo. Cambrian College business professor Brian Vendramin isn't surprised that a public dispute between retail giant Walmart and credit card collusus Visa has come to a close. But he is surprised by the timing. "I expected a resolution in early to mid November, before the start of the holiday shopping season," said Vendramin, an expert in retail business and marketing. He believes the announcement by Visa that the feud had ended was likely the result of sobering financial figures. "The Christmas numbers came in and there was a gap," said Vendramin. Walmart Canada officials said its spat with Visa was in response to the company's demands for lower service rates than what is charged to other businesses.  In July 2015, the retailer stopped accepting Visa payments at its Thunder Bay stores. Walmart's stepped up the dispute in October, expanding the no-Visa policy to its 16 stores in Manitoba, and warning it would phase out Visa all together at all of its 400 stores in Canada. The dispute quickly became a public feud between the two companies, with Visa firing back by offering cardholders in Manitoba a reward for buying their groceries somewhere other than Walmart.  This is currently no information on what led to the resolution. "We may never know the details of the agreement," said Vendramin. "But somebody blinked." Vendramin was markedly critical of both parties in the dispute, saying in the era of social media, the optics of airing dirty laundry in public are not good. "They'll try to paint the situation as David versus Goliath, but really it's Goliath versus Goliath." The statement by Visa indicated that Walmart would resume honouring their credit cards today.

Timothy Blake is charged with pandering obscenity, sexual imposition and two counts of menace by stalking, CBS News says, and he has been booked without bond.  IN-STORE BEATING: Houston-area man accused in Walmart slaying CBS News says a woman told police on Nov. 2 that a man at Walmart, whom she described as "creepy" and "seemed to be lingering around her," walked up behind her and she felt something wet on her back and foot.  The woman then went into the bathroom, where she discovered it was a "sticky" substance, the report says. Ohio police got a similar call on Dec. 28 and noticed the same white pickup truck in the parking lot in surveillance video, the report says. Officers interviewed Blake, the owner of the truck. He allegedly told them that he threw egg yolks at the women, but he later admitted to masturbating into a syringe in his truck or in the Walmart bathroom, CBS News says.  YIKES!: Florida man accused of looking up women's skirts at Walmart   The affidavit obtained by CBS states Blake is married and that his wife was unaware of his actions. Blake reportedly told police that he blames his parents and said they molested him as a child.  He was charged on Dec. 30.

Holiday season is officially over. Schools, stores, bars — everything is open again and everybody is back to work. Not exciting? Indeed, I mean who wouldn’t want to stay at home for another week and unpack all the presents or watch more Christmas movies, even though we have seen them a hundred times already? Well, watching movies is fine, but I wouldn’t rush to unpack all of the presents. Did it ever happen to you, that after holidays you end up with two exactly identical coffee makers or pajamas that don’t fit you? It happened to me, and that was the time when I had to learn which stores have the best gifts return policy and how I can utilize this! In fact, 10 to 15 percent of holiday sales and merchandise are returned or exchanged, and millions of dollars are coming back on the shelves, according to the National Retail Federation. So to help you not to get stuck with unwanted gifts, here is the list of stores with their gifts return policy. 1. Wal-mart Even though by their official rules, they only accept returns within 90 days of purchase, you can still get your money back even after that date. As their main rule — a customer is always right. Another great part about their gifts return policy is that they don’t need receipts. Of course, Wal-mart would prefer you to have one, but again customer is always right. So, without a receipt, you will be able to get an even exchange, a cash refund, or a Wal-Mart gift card, depending on the amount of the purchase. However, be aware that it doesn’t always apply to returns of electronics. groceries, and some other items. [Image by NoDerog/iStock] 2. Nordstrom Officially, Nordstrom return policy is on a case-by-case basis “with the ultimate objective of making our customers happy.” In reality, though, they have one of the best return policies ever. Receipt or no receipt, they don’t care as long as you bought it at Nordstrom. They don’t have customer service or return counter; you can approach any sales associate and they would be happy to assist you. The only exception they have is regarding evening gowns because people used to utilize their kindness too much. So if you got your gift from Nordstrom and it doesn’t fit, don’t be scared to go there and take advantage of their great gifts return policy! 3. Macy’s Another department store which cares about its customers, by offering competitive gifts returns policy. They have posted their gift return policy online for better convenience. However, you should be aware that they have made some significant changes to it. For instance, Macy’s now requires all returns to be made in one year. They had to tighten their unlimited returns due to a high volume of fraud. Another catch is that you can’t return gifts for cash; you will be issued a gift card for the corresponding amount of money, if you have a gift receipt. If you don’t you still get a credit but it will be for the lowest selling price of the last 180 days. jetcityimage/iStock 4. Kohl’s Kohl’s refers to its return policy as “Hassle-Free Returns.” The same as in Wal-mart if you don’t have the receipt and paid in cash, you will receive a store credit, and the amount will be based on the lowest 13-week sale price. However, if you paid with a credit card they will refund the full money amount. Also, there are no time restrictions on your returns and refunds, so don’t be ashamed to take that extra coffee maker back! 5. Target Target’s policy is the strictest one on this list. Also, it varies depending on what you have purchased and its condition. For example, Target brand items unopened and unused can be returned within one year; music, video games, and movies cannot be returned but may be exchanged. The most important rule in their gifts return policy is that items purchased between November 1 and December 25 are subject to a 30-day return period that starts Dec. 26. So hurry up if you got something from Target. I hope this guide will help you to save some money and get rid of the unwanted gifts!

By Caroline Thompson, Brad's Deals January 8, 2017 Save for later Saved Sears gift cards inside a department store in Garden City, N.Y. Shannon Stapleton/Reuters/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of Last year was a rough one for retail. 154 Walmart stores closed, trendy '00s brands like Aeropostale went up in flames, and even the athletic outfitting giant Sports Authority took a final, shaky breath before shutting down for good. If you thought it was going to get better in 2017, you're in for a rough ride.  While department stores have dominated shopping culture for more than a century, it seems their reign is coming to an end. After a lackluster holiday season, Macy's has announced it will follow through on the promise it made back in August, and close at least 68 stores this year. Meanwhile, Sears Holdings, which owns both Kmart and Sears, plans to close 108 Kmart stores and 42 Sears locations over the next few months. "We are closing locations that are unproductive or are no longer robust shopping destinations due to changes in the local retail shopping landscape, as well as monetizing locations with highly valued real estate," Macy's outgoing Chairman and CEO Terry Lundgren said in a press release. "These are never easy decisions, and we are committed to treating associates affected by these closings with respect and transparency." Recommended: Can you handle adulthood?

He added it will be difficult for China's foreign trade to improve in 2017 due to rising costs and other factors. China is the world's largest trading nation. It could be heavily exposed to protectionist measures this year if Trump follows through on campaign pledges to brand it a currency manipulator and impose heavy tariffs on imports of Chinese goods.

With Sears' announcement Thursday coming only a day after rival Macy's saying it would close 68 locations, the department store concept itself is looking like an endangered species. In a retail landscape now dominated by online sellers like Amazon and big-box chains like Walmart and Home Depot, Sears finds itself in a search for a reason to exist.   "The brand has lost relevance,  it’s lost customers and it’s lost its real reason for existence on the American retail scene,'' says Neil Saunders, CEO of Conlumino, a retail consulting firm. Following "the trajectory they're on, there are no real signs of them turning it around to profitability.'' Sears has more than 1,300 stores remaining in its portfolio, so its demise could be prolonged. But if the retailer is unable to stem its financial bleeding and is forced into bankruptcy or perhaps a final assets sale, its loss would be akin to that of dominating American companies like airline Pan Am or five-and dime F.W. Woolworth. "I honestly don’t see a spot for Sears long-term," says Van Conway, CEO of Van Conway & Partners, who has advised retail companies and other businesses on reorganization and insolvency. "My mom shopped at Sears. That was the only place she could go. Now you have 50 choices, and Sears is outdated.’’ Founded in 1886, Sears launched its first large, general catalog a decade later and for generations was the go-to source for products ranging from watches to washing machines. Though it lost its place as the nation's biggest retailer to Walmart in the 1990s, Sears enjoyed a renaissance during that decade under the helm of then-CEO Arthur Martinez, who pushed a greater focus on apparel sales and other initiatives. The company faltered in the 2000s, selling its more than $30 billion credit portfolio to Citibank in  2003 and merging the Sears brand with Kmart, another struggling big box chain. CEO Edward Lampert, a hedge fund manager who shepherded the Sears tie-up with Kmart, initiated his own turnaround strategy, loaning the company cash, spinning off parts of the business and putting Sears' Kenmore, Diehard and Craftsman brands up for sale. © Elise Amendola, AP Sears Holding announced it will be closing 108 Kmart and 42 Sears stores. Sears' travails are part of a broader struggle that has engulfed many traditional retailers trying to compete in an environment in which consumers can buy virtually any item by browsing online and without setting foot in a store. "One thing people used to use department stores for was wide choice and selection,'' Saunders says. "There's no wider choice than on the Internet, so a lot of the reasons for going to those department stores just doesn't exist the way it once did.'' In addition to Sears, many retailers, including Kohl's and JCPenney, have failed to innovate in ways that will continue to woo shoppers. “We're seeing now in retail a lot of legacy players that are dead, dying or in danger of dying because of their inability to do that,'' says Mark Cohen, director of retail studies at Columbia Business School,  who is the former CEO of Sears Canada. The flurry of steps taken in recent days by Sears is a stark illustration of the moves it is making to try to survive. In addition to the store closures, Sears announced Wednesday that it had obtained a $500 million loan commitment backed by mortgages on 46 properties belonging to its subsidiaries. That adds to its long-term debt, which had ballooned from $2.2 billion at the end of January 2016 to $3.7 billion at the end of October.  "From what I can see, these are very intelligent financial maneuvers to raise money,’’ says Conway. “But the whole issue is, is the core business of the retailer viable?"

Details of the agreement, which was announced Thursday and ended a months-long dispute between the two corporate behemoths, have not been provided by the companies. But Dan Kelly, president and CEO of the CFIB, says he suspects Walmart was able to negotiate a reduction in merchant fees — a move that could impact smaller merchants. “Typically whenever there is a special deal created for one large merchant, it happens at the expense of smaller merchants,” he said, explaining that credit card companies and banks customarily look for other ways to make up lost fee revenue. “We’re going to have to watch this really closely to see if this special deal for Walmart comes with higher prices for other smaller merchants.” CFIB, which represents over 109,000 business owners across the country, will continue to lobby Visa and other credit card companies for lower merchant fees for small- and medium-sized companies, Kelly added. In July, Walmart began refusing Visa credit cards at its three stores in Thunder Bay, Ont., citing excessive fees. In October, it extended that ban to Manitoba, where it has 16 stores. As of Friday, Walmart resumed accepting Visa at those stores. Visa spokeswoman Carla Hindman said the company’s agreement with Walmart is specific to that retailer and doesn’t affect other merchants. “As previously announced, we have implemented rate changes aimed at lowering costs for businesses in Canada several times,” Hindman said in an email.

Three children shot and killed in Four Hills. A man found decapitated outside a northeast Albuquerque Walmart. These gruesome murders made for a string of shocking headlines in 2016. But they were just a few of the 61 killings throughout the city last year, a number that marks a 32 percent jump from the year prior and the highest figure in 20 years. The city’s violent crime rate has risen each year since 2007. And four double homicides last year, and the triple murder of three young children in Four Hills, contributed to an increase of 15 killings from the year before – from 46 to 61. Advertisement Continue reading In an interview with the Journal on Friday, homicide Sergeant Elizabeth Thomson said the high number, as well as the brutal nature of so many of the murders, is cause for concern for her and her detectives. “We’ve seen some horrific murders in 2016,” she said. “It’s been a rough year overall.” The recent spike in murders in Albuquerque is at odds with a national trend of low murder rates in the majority of American cities, according to a study by the Brennan Center for Justice that provided crime projections for 2016. While a couple of large cities have seen a huge jump in murders, overall violent crimes across the country remain near a 30-year low, according to the study. Chicago had more than 750 homicides, according to the Chicago Tribune, and Baltimore had more than 300, according to the Baltimore Sun. In El Paso, a city with a slightly higher population than Albuquerque, there were only 18 homicides in 2016. While this year’s total number of murders is the highest it’s been since 1996, it doesn’t reflect a murder rate because it doesn’t factor in population growth in Albuquerque. Advertisement Continue reading It’s not possible to accurately calculate 2016’s murder rate because the city’s estimated population isn’t yet available for 2016. But, calculating the 2016 rate using 2015’s estimated population results in a rate of 10.9 murders per 100,000. That would make it the highest per capita murder rate since 2002, when the rate was slightly higher at 11.2, according to Journal calculations based on FBI crime data. The murder rates in 2009, 2005 and 2003 were more than 10 but less than 10.9. A rough summer A significant portion of 2016’s killings – 41 percent – remain unsolved, according to data kept by the Journal. That 59 percent clearance rate is the first dip in recent years for the Albuquerque Police Department’s homicide unit, which usually maintains a clearance rate of around 80 percent, well above the national average. Sgt. Thomson said that, while many of the murders haven’t been cleared yet, she is confident her seven-member detective team will be able to clear most of them in the upcoming months. She said the increased number of murders in 2016 affected the clearance rate. “The summer was rough; we had seven in July and seven in August, those were heavy months and it puts a strain on the detectives,” she said. “We are close on a lot of them.” Thomson said the most notable trends she found were the increases in murders stemming from fights or drug activity. Seventeen murders were the results of fights and 11 were connected in some way to drugs or drug dealing. Two thirds of the murders involved guns, an increase from previous years, according to Thomson. Several victims were homeless, including Clifford Miller, whose decapitated and mutilated body was found outside the Walmart near Menual and Wyoming NE in mid-December. And murder-suicides skyrocketed last year. “There are some years where we don’t see any murder-suicides, or we see one,” Thomson said. “Last year, we had eight people who were murdered as part of murder-suicide. That is a very disturbing trend to me.” Advertisement Continue reading But perhaps the most defining feature of the year was a total of six young children who were tragically killed at the hands of family members or in acts of domestic violence, sending repeated shock waves through the city as the year wore on. Motives and other details of many of the less high-profile killings haven’t been reported and aren’t publicly known. That’s because, in 2016, the department, along with the Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Office, did not provide basic information to the public about several murders, especially for those that remain unsolved. Thomson said they withhold information from the public so that when detectives are interviewing a suspect they can be sure the person has first-hand knowledge of the crime and didn’t just see it on television or read it in the paper. Shocking deaths Some of the details that were released on the city’s worst crimes – those involving the death of children – shocked the city and made national news. The brutal murder and dismemberment of 10-year-old Victoria Martens in August was one of the most gruesome crimes Albuquerque has seen. Police say Victoria was drugged, raped and either strangled or stabbed to death and dismembered by her mother’s boyfriend, Fabian Gonzales, and his cousin Jessica Kelley. Victoria’s mother, Michelle Martens, looked on and made no move to stop them, according to police. Advertisement Continue reading All three are charged with murder and other charges. Four days after Victoria’s death, another young girl was found dead. Nhi Nguyen, 11, was shot and killed by her stepfather Trinh Tran Van, who also shot and killed his wife Cam Thi To in their Northwest Albuquerque apartment before turning the gun on himself. In late February, 1-year-old Jayden Dayea was beaten to death by his mother’s boyfriend, according to police. In early December, three more children were killed when police say their mother’s ex-boyfriend broke into her house and waited for the family to return. Then, police say suspect George Daniel Wechsler shot all four of them, killing the children and critically injuring their mother before killing himself. Elijah Mascarenas, 5, Olivia Mascarenas, 6, and Ian Mascarenas, 9, were buried Monday. Thomson said that the number of children killed last year is not unusual, but the manner of their deaths was often more shocking than in years past. “The trend isn’t that there were more children killed,” she said. “The trend is that we had more murders where the nature of them is more horrific. Victoria is one of those, and then the three children killed in one incident – it weighs heavier on everyone.” Fight for more officers The rising property crime and violent crime rates have not gone unnoticed. Advertisement Continue reading In an interview Friday, Mayor Richard Berry said he hopes to bring the police force back up and is fighting for return to work legislation in the legislative session to get more officers on the streets. “There are a lot of things we can do holistically to fight crime,” he said. “There are some things we can do within the city and some things we need the Legislature to do to help us get more officers in the field.” Thomson said that it’s up to police to build good relationships within the community so people feel comfortable reaching out to officers in times of need. But, she said, murder is unlike any other crime that officers deal with. “Murder is very different from other crimes that people experience in our city,” she said. “It is a symptom of things going wrong in people’s lives.” Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe ABQnews Seeker Albuquerque News Crime From the newspaper Front Page News Suggested Stories: Notorious crimes of 2013 – Jan 2, 2014 Albuquerque homicides down despite recent violence – Aug 22, 2014 Murders in Albuquerque up sharply in 2015 – Jan 4, 2016 San Antonio records 151 homicides in 2016, most in 2 decades – Jan 1, 2017 Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

(Reuters/Gonzalo Fuentes) Share Written by Marc Bain Obsession Fashion January 07, 2017 Clothes took over as the top-selling category online in the US, and Amazon is cornering the market. Owner of sites such as Zappos, it’s set to become the largest apparel retailer in the US in 2017. Given that its apparel margins are higher than most other categories, according to analysts, that bodes well for future profits. Jet.com, the Walmart-owned, rapidly growing competitor, isn’t daunted. The company announced Jan. 5 that it has acquired ShoeBuy.com, a Zappos rival with more than 800 brands and a product assortment that also includes clothes and accessories. The $70 million deal closed at the end of 2016. The move lets Jet quickly establish a presence in that valuable online market for shoes and apparel, even if it won’t dethrone Amazon anytime soon. ShoeBuy will continue to operate as a standalone site, according to Walmart’s press release, and brands will have the option to sell through Jet directly, giving it a potentially profitable foothold in a high-margin space. And Jet gets those 800 brand relationships. Marc Lore, Jet’s cofounder, told Recode it’s a safe bet that Jet and Walmart will look for other acquisitions of this sort “in the categories where they are long-tail, high-margin products and harder-to-crack brands.” The $70 million price tag looks low, given ShoeBuy’s estimated revenue of $315 million in 2013, suggesting sales are down or the company isn’t very profitable. But Lore believes Walmart’s relationships and logistics operations can give ShoeBuy’s business a boost, helping it to grow more valuable despite a market filled with competitors. An earlier version of this article misidentified Marc Lore as ShoeBuy’s cofounder instead of Jet’s cofounder. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search Post to Cancel

Take the Pledge to stop distracted driving. Courtesy of Fanelli, Evans & Patel, P.C. By Frank Andruscavage / Published: January 7, 2017 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     SAINT CLAIR — A 4-year-old boy died from injuries he suffered in a crash in Saint Clair on Thursday afternoon. The crash occurred about 12:15 p.m. at the intersection of Route 61 and Terry Rich Boulevard, the entrance to the Wal-Mart plaza, and also caused injuries to three other people, all adults. Saint Clair police Sgt. Joseph Leskin Jr., the investigating officer, on Friday released the names of those involved. Leskin said the investigation indicates that Franklin Krammes, 36, of Pottsville, was driving a Nissan minivan and attempted to make a left turn from Route 61 south to enter the Wal-Mart plaza. Leskin said the Krammes vehicle was struck on the passenger’s side by a northbound Ford F-150 truck driven by Maryann Rhody, Schuylkill Haven. The impact happened in the middle of the intersection and both vehicles sustained extensive damage, Leskin said. Leskin said Krammes and a front seat passenger in his vehicle — Brenda Covach, 54, of Saint Clair — along with Rhody were taken to a Pottsville hospital by Schuylkill EMS for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries. Issac Krammes, 85 Macomb Street, New Philadelphia, who was a back seat passenger in the Krammes vehicle, was flown from the scene by helicopter to Lehigh Valley Hospital, Cedar Crest. Leskin said the child was pronounced dead at 5:24 p.m. at Lehigh Valley Hospital from blunt force back and neck injuries, according to Lehigh County Coroner Scott Grim.

(REUTERS/Rebecca Cook)    4443001 Video footage taken from a Florida Wal-Mart shows a shopper literally jumping the gun. The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

She was just one of the many volunteers who helped raise more than $360,000 surpassing the army's goal. JUSTIN PARSONS/St. Albert Gazette Donations are up and still rolling in after a successful Salvation Army holiday kettle drive. The Salvation Army campaigns rolled out across the region on Nov. 14 and the local branch surpassed its fundraising goal of $350,000 by more than $10,000. During the holiday season the local office, which includes St. Albert, Spruce Grove and Stony Plain, collected $360,911. This is up from last years total of $324,560. Donations are way up considering they keep telling us the economy is really bad, Maj. Terry Cook, pastor and core officer at the Salvation Army said. The people of St. Albert must have really dug deep. I suspect that when the economy goes a little bit south, people know that there are more people hurting so they are just a little more generous. In total the organization had nine kettles out in St. Albert to raise money, but they had trouble finding the volunteers to staff them. There were days when the organization could not put out all of their kettles because of volunteer shortages. The group had particular trouble filling the shifts in Stony Plain and had one kettle only sporadically manned during the season. The group had arrangements at other locations but were not able to set up due to a lack of volunteers. I dont know if the people realize the money raised there, stays there, said Kellie McTaggart, Community Services Coordinator for the Salvation Army. In a typical day each kettle requires five two-hour shifts, running from Monday to Saturday. McTaggart said there were a lot of volunteers who did a lot of shifts but they needed more manpower. All the money raised over the holiday season will go into the community and family services budget which goes directly towards community programs and services. The money will also help support clients in St. Albert and surrounding areas. The fundraising dollars were especially needed this year. The organization just started the Feed the Lambs program, which provides breakfast for students in need at 14 elementary schools in the community. The Salvation Army is looking to expand the program next fall and will need more donations to expand into more schools. The organization is also supporting 1,300 members of the community through direct client assistance, which is higher than in previous years. The Salvation Army accepts cash donations year-round. To donate mail a cheque to the local branch or stop by and give cash, debit or credit. The Salvation Army is located at 165 Liberton Drive in St. Albert and they can be reached at 780-458-1937.

St George News+ 45 53/33 Mon 47/30 Tue 50/32 News short: Man found dead in his truck at Wal-Mart identified Written by Ric Wayman January 3, 2017 Washington police officers found a man deceased in his car Tuesday afternoon at Wal-Mart. Washington, Utah, Jan. 3, 2017 | Photo courtesy of Holly Blaha, St. George News WASHINGTON — Officers responded to the Washington Wal-Mart Tuesday afternoon and found a man dead in his vehicle. A man was discovered dead in his truck Tuesday at the Washington Wal-Mart. Washington, Utah, Jan. 3, 2017 | Photo courtesy of Matt Thompson, St. George News “There was a male adult found deceased in his vehicle,” Washington City Police Public Information Officer Ed Kantor said. “(There were) no indications of foul play, and until the medical examiner’s report is completed we won’t know the cause of death.” Kantor said there was no indication of any kind what could have caused the man’s death. Officials were called to the scene between 4-4:30 p.m. and found the man inside a gold truck with a black camper shell on the back. “(No) evidence of any violence or anything like that. It could have been medical, natural causes, we don’t know,” Kantor added. The man has been identified as James Garlick, 40, of Mona. His sister Carol Bullard of Washington confirmed to St. George News Tuesday night that Garlick was the man found in the truck. “Actually it was weird,” Bullard said in an internet chat. “We had been looking for him for days and my daughter happened to be at Walmart picking up a prescription and saw the cops in the parking lots with the caution tape around a vehicle that looked like my brothers so she immediately called me and I told her to go over and ask if it was him so she did and it was so she ended up telling me then I rushed down there.” Bullard said she has notified the rest of the family about Garlick’s death. He is survived by his parents, 6 children and 8 brothers and sisters. Bullard had posted on her Facebook account that Garlick was missing since Sunday and had asked for help in locating him. This report is based on preliminary information provided by law enforcement or other emergency responders and may not contain the full scope of findings.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Court: Apple Valley Town Council violated Brown Act in 2013 with Wal-Mart MOU Friday Jan 6, 2017 at 6:15 PM Jan 6, 2017 at 6:21 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — An appellate court in Riverside has upheld, in part, a previous ruling that a ballot measure passed to authorize siting and construction for a Wal-Mart Supercenter in Apple Valley was illegal. The ruling nullifies and voids the town’s Measure D — commonly known as the “Walmart Initiative Measure” — which voters passed during a special election held in November 2013. Additionally, the court reversed another previous ruling that the initiative violated the California Constitution, court documents show. In a statement released Friday, town officials said they were “not able to offer comment at this time, but will be glad to do so once we have time to fully review the ruling.” The Brown Act violation, upheld in the 4th District Court of Appeal by a three-judge panel on Thursday, relates to a memorandum of understanding between the town and Wal-Mart that the Town Council approved during its Aug. 13, 2013, meeting. The MOU allowed the town to accept an offer from Wal-Mart to pay for the special election, according to Town Manager Frank Robinson during the meeting; however, the MOU was not agendized. Court documents: “In none of the documents was the ‘item of business’ that Town council was going to accept a gift from Walmart in order to pay for a special election to pass the Initiative.” Cory Briggs, of Briggs Law Corp., told the Daily Press on Friday he believed the gifted amount was around $250,000, but he added, “it has been so long that I do not recall for sure.” Briggs represented the plaintiff — town resident Gabriel Hernandez — in the case. He said the Brown Act violation resulted in the initiative being illegal. “The MOU was the critical factor establishing the Brown Act violation, according to the court, because the public was not told about it,” Briggs said via email. “At the oral argument the justices repeatedly asked the other side questions like: ‘Don’t you think that someone paying for the election would be information that the public would want to know?’ ... That’s why the town lost. It must fully disclose all potential actions in advance. As this ruling shows, secrecy – if discovered – is fatal.” In February 2015, San Bernardino County Superior Court Judge David Cohn ruled that the voter-approved initiative was illegal under the Brown Act. Cohn also ruled the initiative was unconstitutional under the California Constitution because it granted “special privileges on the ‘owner’ of the property, which is Wal-Mart,” despite Wal-Mart not being named specifically as the owner. In their appeal, the town and Wal-Mart insisted the trial court “erred by looking outside the Initiative to the ballot materials to ‘identify’ Walmart as the beneficiary of the Initiative.” Subsequently, the appellate court ruled that because Wal-Mart could sell the property, “it would have no superior right over the subsequent owner or developer of the property” and ruled that the initiative did not violate the state’s Constitution. Still, Briggs pointed out that “illegal is illegal,” referencing the Brown Act violation. “So my client won and the initiative — including the outcome of the election — is null and void,” he said. According to court documents, another initiative will be considered by the Town Council in the future, and “will be possibly adopted at a later date after appropriate public comment.” Matthew Cabe can be reached at MCabe@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6254.

Members of the flight crew said they noticed the pilot behaving oddly after boarding a Sunwing flight in Calgary last weekend. It was to fly to Cancun, Mexico by way of Regina and Winnipeg with 99 passengers and six crew members on board. Pilot Miroslav Gronych, from Slovakia on a work visa in Canada, was arrested for being three times over the legal driving limit for alcohol consumption, police said. In Canada, it is against the law for pilots to consume any alcohol within eight hours of flying and individual airlines often have stricter rules. Sunwing’s Jacqueline Grossman said the airline has zero tolerance on drinking within 12 hours of duty. Transport Minister Marc Garneau told commercial air carriers he is “very concerned” about the incident and wants them to outline and confirm their safety protocols. “There is the need to ensure that protocols are up to date and are being implemented with all the required resources, including measures designed to confirm pilots’ fitness to fly,” he said. ––– Walmart and Visa have ended a six-month disagreement over credit card fees at its Canadian stores. The retailer is again accepting Visa cards in all its stores after reaching a deal on fees charged by the credit card company. No details were given. Walmart stopped taking Visa cards in Manitoba and Thunder Bay, Ontario last July and threatened to extend the ban across Canada, seeking lower fees. It said it was paying more than $100 million a year for the service, far more than for other cards or payment methods. News in brief ▪ Tens of thousands of customers were without power in parts of Quebec at mid-week after a storm brought freezing rain and snow across much of the province. Ice accumulated on tree branches and wooden poles, causing them to fall and take down power lines. The hardest hit regions were the Outaouais, the Laurentians and the western part of the Monteregie. ▪ Investigators have concluded a massive gas explosion that destroyed a house and damaged 70 others in Mississauga, west of Toronto, last June was a double suicide. The residents of the house, Robert Nadler and wife Diane Page, were found dead among the debris. Police said the house’s natural gas line had been dismantled, leading to the explosion. Facts and figures The Canadian dollar has risen to 75.54 cents U.S. while the U.S. dollar returns $1.323 Canadian, before exchange fees. The Bank of Canada’s key interest rate is steady at 0.5 percent while the prime-lending rate is 2.7 percent. Stock markets are higher, with the Toronto exchange index at 15,505 points while the TSX Venture index is at 790 points.

Regional briefs ▪ The British Columbia government is making $50 million available to immediately hire about 1,100 teachers as ordered by the Supreme Court. A law that blocked the B.C. Teachers’ Federation from bargaining class sizes was ruled unconstitutional, ending a 14-year legal battle. There is also $100 million in a “learning improvement fund” for teachers and education assistants. ▪ A shortage of real estate listings and low interest rates pushed the average price of a house sold in the Greater Toronto Area to $730,472 last month, up 20 percent from a year ago. The record high reported by the Toronto Real Estate Board contrasted with a 2.2-percent price drop to $897,600 on average in the last six months in Greater Vancouver. ▪ Moosehead Breweries cites costs in scrapping plans to build a small-batch brewery on the waterfront in Saint John, New Brunswick.

Alison Southwick and Robert Brokamp, CFP (TMFAlison) Jan 6, 2017 at 5:17PM In this episode of Motley Fool Answers, Alison and Robert take their fans behind the scenes at a special Motley Fool member event in Boston. Tune in as David Gardner, Raj Sisodia, and Morgan Housel share their insights on investing, conscious capitalism, and the nature of innovation. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Nov. 29, 2016. Alison Southwick: This is Motley Fool Answers. I'm Alison Southwick and I'm joined, as always, by Robert Brokamp, personal finance expert here at The Motley Fool. How ya doing, Bro? Robert Brokamp: I'm splendid. How are you, Alison? Southwick: I'm good. In today's episode, we are sneaking our listeners into a recent member event in Boston so that you can eavesdrop on some of the highlights. We'll also answer your question about how we, personally personal finance. All that, and more, on this week's episode of Motley Fool Answers. __ Southwick: It's time for Answers, Answers and today's question comes from Albert. He writes: "I am starting to get proactive about my expenses, but I feel I am still a newcomer. Can you provide advice on what inspires you both to think high-level about your finances in life? I haven't had much guidance growing up and just want to hear what any of your long-term goals are and how you build your plans to achieve them." Any personal examples and obstacles along the way Albert would also like to hear about. Do you want to go first? Brokamp: I'll go first. It's a very interesting question. I was thinking about how I created my beliefs about money in general, because he talked about expenses, and I've always been someone who was frugal. I was never comfortable spending a lot of money and I guess that comes from my parents, although looking at some of the expenses from other people in my family ... my sisters! Southwick: Do they listen to the show? Hope not. Brokamp: I doubt it. A couple of them are more comfortable with spending money than I am, so I don't know if it came from my parents. But we all did go through an experience in high school when my dad's business went belly up and we went through some hard times. I think that was very informative for me. So when I think of my goals as a father, it is to have financial security for my family and that really breaks down into two main categories: college and retirement. Those are the things that motivate me. Those are the things that whenever ... It was my funny. We were sitting around the table and my wife said, "What if you won the lottery?" She's asking everyone at the table, "What if you won the lottery? What would you spend the money on?" And then she looked at me and said, "You can't say retirement and college. Choose something else." And how I stay on top of them is basically I do run my numbers at least once a year in terms of whether we're on track to have enough money to do those things. In terms of obstacles, it's really time. So having the time, on the weekend or whatever, to do all the little, silly personal finance stuff that you probably should do to make your life a little better. Southwick: So I am also a naturally frugal person. Most of my money lessons I learned from my mom and my dad, of course, and they are both completely different. I think I said this before on the show. My mom used to like to say, "Alan, you're good at making money and I'm good at saving money." I think that's what she used to say. Because my dad is very good at making money, but he's also very good at spending money. He came from a family that didn't necessarily have a lot of money, and rather than becoming frugal as a result, he ended up being the "Who knows about tomorrow? Let's have a good time today and have all these good experiences and spend money." And for most of his life he was very good at making money so it wasn't an issue. My mom, on the other hand, came from a fairly wealthy family. She was just naturally frugal and I think often lived under the fear that you may not have money tomorrow. And one of her stories that I will retell to you all, and now Mom gets to hear one of her stories told back to her, was that her mother, my grandmother, once joked that she was down to her last $20. My mom, as a child, heard this and got very worried. And, of course, it wasn't her last $20. Maybe she was just saying it was the last $20 she had in her wallet. It was not their last $20, but for some reason my mom, as a child, thought, "This is our last $20 and we're going to be out on the street." And she was terrified. I think that was kind of an offhanded comment that her grandmother made, but it really affected my mom long-term. So I learned most of my frugal habits from my mom, but I also think I learned from my dad to also spend money and enjoy yourself, so Ron and I will not hesitate to spend an insane amount of money on a really nice meal, which is probably one of the most ridiculous things you can spend a lot of money on next to like a boat. But that's what we enjoy doing, so we're not afraid to treat ourselves now and then. That's how both my parents influenced my thinking on money. I'm naturally frugal and scared of not having money. I like having money. Also I would point out that Ron and I have both been very lucky that we've always been employed and we have good health. I think if either one of those went away, we would be in such serious trouble ... not because we didn't make good, sound financial decisions, but just because that can absolutely sink you. Brokamp: Right. That's true. One of the biggest causes of people who go into bankruptcy is because of medical issues. Southwick: Right. So on the one hand we try to make a series of one good decision after another. Not spend too much. Live within our means. Brokamp: And you've been planning for a while. I know both of you have been saving for retirement for a while. Southwick: Yeah. And I'm not particularly worried, but as far as goals go, I think just not being out on the street is a pretty good one. I guess I was saying that we make one good decision after another and to just be thankful for what we have. That we've been set up to also succeed, as well, thanks to our parents, and our decisions, and luck. I don't know. I don't know what else to say. I mean, we don't buy anything until we have the money for it. I know that sounds dumb and not terribly profound, but we've been saving up for a new car for like 10 years now. That comes after everything else. The new car fund doesn't get money into it until everything else has money in it, including college fund, retirement fund, blah, blah, blah. Brokamp: That's impressive, actually. Southwick: That what? Brokamp: That you do that. I know it's a crazy thing in America to say this, but that you save until you have the money to pay for something to buy it, as opposed to going into debt to get it. Southwick: I don't know. Rick, how about you? Rick Engdahl: I am not on that side of the glass because I am not a frugal person, not particularly disciplined, and I don't have a lot of inspiration when it comes to personal finance. It's not a subject that interests me. Which is why I wholeheartedly believe in automation, because I can set it up so that my check comes in and savings automatically drips into all my various accounts, and that's that. And then whatever is left over I can spend. Southwick: And do. Engdahl: And do. Once I paid off my credit card years ago, my rule has just been that when the bill comes in, I pay it in full and that's it. Brokamp: And you've been an investor for years, and we know, now, that you are saving for your kids' college education, so that's good. Engdahl: I've always been saving for their educations, but now I'm saving by way of a 529 ... whatever that thing's called. Brokamp: Yes, right. Yes, that thing. That's the thing you're doing. Engdahl: But investing for years means I automated that. That's automated, too. Everything is automated, because I don't like to think about it. Brokamp: That's good advice. Southwick: I wouldn't say that Ron or I do anything necessarily that's terribly sophisticated or complex. It's just like make money. Be sure you're making money. And then spend less than you're making. And try to make the most out of what you didn't spend. Brokamp: That's actually a pretty good formula though. Southwick: We'll see. Brokamp: We'll see. Southwick: We've got a few years ahead of us in retirement, so we'll be OK. Villages, here we come. Brokamp: Here we come. __ Southwick: For today's episode we're doing a little eavesdropping on a member event that we just held in Boston for our ONE members. But, even though you're not a member, you're going to get to sneak into the room. It's cool. You're with me. We're highlighting three speakers from the event. Bro, you attend a fair number of member events. Can you set the stage? What's it like? Brokamp: Well, it's usually in a nice place in a nice city. We often have keynote speakers and then breakouts. We try to bring in prominent thinkers about investing or some aspect of society, so it's not always investing-related. We try to bring in some executives, particularly if it's the executives and companies from recommendations in any of our services. And really the great thing is just to meet all the people who are Motley Fool members. Southwick: Yeah, they're great. Brokamp: They are. They're the best. Southwick: So let's start with a familiar voice. David Gardner was interviewed by Chris Hill, and Chris asked him for some investing tips. David talked a bit about how winners tend to keep winning, so you shouldn't sell your stocks that have experienced huge gains just because the media tells you they can't possibly keep on winning. And then David continued with some additional advice. __ David Gardner: I think most people are looking, understandably, at near-term results, both for their own investment portfolios and at the businesses that they own. Looking at the near-term results when, of course, it's the long term that matters for both of those things. I think people are often looking at the wrong things that way. Another example is for people -- and we all do this -- each of these things is natural. It's also just natural to look at the win-loss record. It's also very natural to look at what's not working and to think that the stock that just lost 25% yesterday is much more important than the stock that you might have purchased 10 years ago and has been a good holding and went up only 3% yesterday. But often the math works out really well. I think you should be focused on your winners, so learning lessons from our winners and not too many lessons from our losers. Psychologists, too, remind us that the pain of loss is three times the joy of gain, so again it's understandable why people care so much about something that's down, but I much prefer to focus on what's up. And then maybe a third and final example (I'm going to say these words carefully, just because they matter) is I think most people, again, are looking at the wrong thing. I think many people are looking at the valuations of beaten-down also-rans; and that's where they're fishing, often, for their next investment. And by direct contrast, looking at the right things, I prefer to look at not the valuation but the performance of not beaten-down also-rans, but the performance of innovative leaders. Those are a few examples. Chris Hill: The last time you and I were onstage talking, it was FoolFest. You had just had your 50th birthday. Here we are, now. Your service, Rule Breakers, has just had a birthday -- much younger, though -- 12 years. When you think back over the last 12 years, two questions. First, what are one or two lessons that you have drawn from 12 years of rule breaking investing? Gardner: I think probably the most important lesson that I've learned -- and that we've all learned if you're a rule breaker, or if you followed our scorecard of what we've done -- is learning to fail. In fact, I bounced away from my talk this morning to see a local university that my son is applying to, and one of the things they say at this school is "we're looking for 'risk-takers' willing to fail." And I think that we have failed grandly and far more often in Motley Fool Rule Breakers than I think any other service at The Motley Fool. And I don't like that. We have 48 stocks that have lost 50% or more of their value. I've picked, with the help of my team, two stocks every single month since we launched in October, 2004, so 12 years ago this month that's 288 stocks. Forty-eight of them have lost 50% or more of their value. But we're a winning service, and so the important statistic that you need to know, I think, is that the 48th best stock that we've selected as of this morning (pre-market open ... I haven't updated my numbers) is Vertex Pharmaceuticals, which is up 187.4%. So if you do the math with me, I hope you're willing to lose 50% or more 48 times in order that your 48th best pick would be well above 100% gain. If you do the math with me, you'll see that that's a game you want to play every time, but it's very hard for many people, especially who have just joined Motley Fool services, and that's not true of this august crowd. But many people come and when their first stock drops 10% if it has bad earnings, that's very upsetting for them. So I think we've learned that lesson. If you're a rule breaker you know it. You're a risk-taker willing to fail, and the good news is our top two picks, alone, have wiped out all of those losses from all the other 48 worst picks we've ever made. Hill: This may be an unfair question, but I'll ask it anyway. Gardner: Go for it. Hill: Go back 12 years in time and think about your mentality, your approach as a rule breaker. Has your approach stayed the same throughout, and if not, in what ways has the rule breaker approach changed for you? Gardner: Well, ostensibly the rule breaker approach is the same. I mean, of course we're all adapting and evolving constantly, so it doesn't matter whether you're 70, 50, 30, or younger than that. You're going to change again and your mentality will. I can say, ostensibly, we haven't changed because the bedrock of what I wrote in the book Rule Breakers, Rule Makers -- that Tom and I wrote in 1998 -- those six traits that I wrote about then are exactly what we use today in 2016. The world may have changed some in the last 18 years, but we're still doing the same Fool thing in that way. But at the same time, yeah, my mentality 12 years ago was I didn't quite as much value the importance of culture at companies, where today I know I'm not the only one at the Fool. When I talked about how you're in a room full of people and you're hearing from people today who understand what matters, I think the culture of the institutions matters a great deal; much more than I appreciated 12 years ago. And I hope I was generally consistent with this 12 years ago, but I am only reminded, more and more today, of how important it is for me that the companies that I recommend in Rule Breakers do things that improve the world. That are admirable companies. When they succeed, I want us all to feel great about it. I want to feel great about that company succeeding. One thing that I wrote a couple of years ago, which is one of my favorite things that I've written, is just make your portfolio your best expression of your hopes for our future. I think that should be true of the things that you're invested in. When they win, we all win and you feel great about what happened. Southwick: I love that so much I want to embroider it on a pillow. Isn't it the best? It is. "Make your portfolio your best expression of your hopes for our future." I love that. Brokamp: My hopes for our future are that everyone goes out and gets Starbucks coffee while they're visiting a Home Depot because those are stocks in my portfolio. And they get surgery from a robot through Intuitive Surgical. Southwick: Buying some Disney products on Amazon Prime. Brokamp: There you go. Make sure you check your Facebook. Engdahl: It sounds like we're going to need a disclaimer this episode. Brokamp: Every company I just mentioned I personally own. Southwick: You're making fun of me in seeing this is like a very nice, motivational thing, but I do think it's nice. Like I do like the idea of living in a world where Disney movies exist. I don't know. Brokamp: That's what's really exciting about David's style. I mean, he really is looking for trends and the ways that the future will change compared to the other companies he mentioned -- the beaten-down has-beens or something along those lines. It can be a successful way of investing, but it's certainly not as exciting as what David does. Southwick: You're making fun of me for being a little schmaltzy. Whatever. Brokamp: I'm sure I'll love your pillow. Southwick: All right. Next up Tom Gardner interviewed Raj Sisodia. He's the co-founder of the Conscious Capitalism movement and author of the book, Firms of Endearment. Raj started off researching marketing and looking at effective ad spending, but he noticed something ... that some companies didn't have to spend much on advertising at all. Hm! Why was that? He spoke with Tom Gardner about what he learned about the common characteristics of conscious companies and how that equates into higher performance. Raj Sisodia: Well, what about the companies that don't spend a lot and yet have extremely high loyalty and trust? What are they doing? And what can we learn from them? And to me that constitutes marketing excellence. That's the holy grail -- customer loyalty and trust. And so when we started to identify companies just based on that simple lens, we started to find companies like Whole Foods, for example. Whole Foods, at the time, was spending only 10% of the industry average on marketing. They didn't have a chief marketing officer. They didn't have an ad agency. Ninety percent of what they did spend was spent at the store level, not at headquarters. Ninety percent of that related to their community activities, so they somehow thought of marketing as that. I said, "That's not what we teach. That's not supposed to be marketing." But marketing was almost an afterthought. Starbucks had never advertised once in their history at that point. I don't think they have even now, as far as I can tell. There was very little of that. So we started to find these companies. What we soon discovered was it wasn't about the marketing. That for these companies, even their employees were highly loyal and trusting. Their communities deeply embraced these companies and welcomed them. In fact, people waited and camped out in the parking lot before there were new stores or locations opening for some of these businesses. We found that their suppliers had long-term, stable relationships with these companies. So they were really in a stakeholder frame of operation. In other words, they were looking after the well-being of all of their stakeholders. Not just customers, but employees, suppliers, communities. Even the environment, etc. So we saw they were treating everybody the way customers should be treated. Understanding their needs and really creating value consciously for all of their stakeholders. And then beyond that, we found that they had a reason for being. It's not just another airline, or just another retailer, or just another furniture shop, or CarMax. They were trying to reinvent, or change the way something was being done. They had a purpose. So it's not a business with a mission. This was like a mission with a business. Whole Foods was trying to change the way people eat and think about food, and change the way we run our food system, and the health of the planet, and all of that is impacted by the way that they define their business. The Container Store is trying to help you get organized so you can feel less stressed out and more relaxed. Southwest was trying to bring freedom to the skies and enable more people to travel. Make it fun. Make it affordable. Make it accessible. So they all have a reason for being. CarMax was trying to reinvent the used car selling business, which of course, as we know, you feel like you walk in there and you're going to get victimized. So there was a purpose -- a higher purpose. We discovered that these businesses have a higher purpose. They're stakeholder oriented. And then we also discovered their leaders were different. They're typically, in many cases, still the founders. Even if it's not the founder -- if it's a 100-year-old company -- somebody who has a passion for what this business is about. What they're trying to do. They're driven by service to the purpose and service to the people -- and not so much about power and their own personal ego and enrichment. They're much more, I would say, down to earth. More like servant leaders than your command-and-control, top-down, almost like a legal type of leader. And then lastly, we found the cultures. The Motley Fool has a fantastic culture. You only know them as clients, but if you go and visit them, they pay a lot of attention to the culture. It's a lot of fun. There's a lot of trust, there's a lot of transparency, and there's caring. There's authentic caring for human beings at the heart of these companies. [Northwest] Airlines -- the stock market symbol is LUV. L-U-V, right? What they talk about is we love our customers. We love. We love everyone to death. It's all rooted in that. And most businesses, unfortunately, are rooted in fear and stress. They think the way to get people to perform is to just constantly put pressure on them. Carrots and sticks. Think about that. What animal belongs between a carrot and a stick? A jackass -- not a human being. And yet we use that kind of language and people start behaving that way. They're still trying to get the carrot and avoid the stick. So that's the big difference and those are the four pillars. Let me now describe Conscious Capitalism but they were really uncovered in that book. Halfway through I said it's not about marketing. We're discovering all these people talking about love, and care, and trust, and compassion, and all of that. So I was calling it "Share of Heart" for a while. And I said, "You know in marketing, we used to talk about share of market and then we had share of wallet." And our editor said, "So now you're talking about share of heart? What comes next? Share of soul?" A cynical view of marketing. Fortunately we didn't stick with that and we ended up calling it Firms of Endearment. Companies that are loved by everybody and how you do that. And the icing on the cake -- at the end of all of our research and selecting the companies based on these criteria -- we did the financial analysis. And we said, "You know, these companies are paying their people better." Certainly at the front lines. Costco pays double of Wal-Mart. The Container Store pays double the prevailing wage in the industry. They provide much better benefits. Starbucks provides generous healthcare even to part-time employees, for example. They're taking care of their customers. Providing great customer care. They're not squeezing their suppliers. Suppliers are profitable, and innovative, and healthy. They're investing in their communities. They're investing in the environment. They're paying taxes at an average rate of 34% -- that sample of companies. We said, "Maybe investor returns are good but nothing phenomenal because they are spending in all these other areas." What we found actually stunned us -- that these companies outperformed the market 9 to 1 over a 10-year period. That would have been 1996 to 2006 because the book came out in 2007. We had 18 public companies in that. We thought we had made a mistake. We went and redid the analysis. How can this be? Because we still had that zero-sum mentality. That if you need to do more for employees you'll have to take it away from investors. If you want to pay more, maybe your margins will have to suffer. Well, no. Business is not a zero-sum game. It's the ultimate positive-sum game on this planet. I don't think anything else comes close. You create extraordinary amounts of value when you align everybody together around a shared sense of purpose. So you're excited to go to work on Monday. You don't say, "Thank God it's Friday." Do you know that heart attacks are highest on Monday morning, by the way? Twenty percent higher. Monday morning at 4:00 a.m. is the peak. That's the state of affairs we have. So what we found is that these companies have broken that trade-off mentality, and when you align everything together you create this virtual cycle of higher performance. And nobody has to suffer in that. Everybody matters, and everybody can win when you do business in the right way. And it's not about making money, and having a bunch of side effects. These businesses are able to operate with a spectrum of positive effects. It's not just financial. It's intellectual capital. It's social capital. It's emotional well-being. It's spiritual well-being. Physical well-being. Ecological well-being. It has a positive impact on the culture, and those are all the consequences of how we choose to operate. So as I said, that book turned my life around, because until then I just had a job and a bit of a career in marketing, and now I had a calling. And I still remember sitting in Pennsylvania in the Poconos at some writing retreat and I had tears in my eyes as we were writing some of the stories about these companies, and the deep humanity that exists inside corporations, or can exist if you allow it to. Because human beings are wired to care and corporations are designed to snuff that out for the most part. You're supposed to leave that at the door. Put on your mask and armor and show up for battle. It doesn't have to be that way. Why can't we combine love and work? Those are the two aspects of being human. Southwick: As part of my job here at The Motley Fool, I also do media relations and so sometimes that means getting our analysts out there talking about investing. Sometimes it means talking about workplace culture at the Fool. And it's funny to me how there's this tone, generally, that work sucks. Brokamp: Right. Southwick: And I guess that it does, and it historically has, really, been hard and difficult work; but many people today, including all of us here at The Motley Fool, have the opportunity to have really rewarding work. And work doesn't have to suck -- but it does suck for many people. I don't know how to reconcile that. Someone's got to clean toilets and I love them for that. Brokamp: I want a pillow that says "make love and work." That's all I'm saying. Southwick: You be careful. Christmas is coming up. Be careful what you wish for. Brokamp: I look forward to it. Southwick: Love and work on a satin pillow. A gift for you and Mrs. Brokamp. All right. Finally friend of the podcast Morgan Housel gave a speech titled, "You Are Not Too Late." He begins by showing the audience an iconic photo of one of the most momentous events in human history. Morgan Housel: This is Wilbur and Orville Wright on December 17, 1903. This picture is the first second of the first flight in human history. And we know, in hindsight, that this is one of the most important events in human history. If you go to the Library of Congress, where I found these papers, you'll find two things that I think are pretty astounding. One is that the first passing mention of the Wright brothers in The New York Times was 1906, three years after their first flight. Even more astounding, I think, is in 1904 (so one year after their first flight) The New York Times interviewed a European count who was a hot air balloon tycoon of sorts. And they asked him if human flight -- what they called back then the flying machine (that's what they called them back then) -- if flying machines would ever become a reality. And this is what he said. He said, "In the very, very, far future," said the Count, with a crescendo accent on the "very" and a shoulder shrug that suggested an eternity, "there may be flying machines, but not now. Not now." This was a year after the Wrights' first flight, in the nation's newspaper of record. There are so many interesting stories that come from the Wright brothers, but to me the most fascinating is this five-year gap between when they changed the world and they convinced people that they changed the world. And I think what's really important is that if you look into it, this is an extreme example, but almost every innovative product throughout time (every big invention that really changes the world and goes on to be one of the most impactful inventions or innovations) is almost never understood at first. The products that are instantly adored are adored because they're familiar, and they're familiar because they're usually just slight improvements over what's already available. But when you have products that are totally transformational, almost nobody gets it at first. And that process between inventing it and getting people to understand it isn't something that takes months or years. It can take decades. We know in hindsight that the car was one of the most transformational inventions of the 20th century, but it took us a quarter of a century to figure that out. This is true for TV, too. This is The New York Times in 1927 talking about the first use of television. It says: "Pictures are Flashed by Wire and Radio Synchronizing with Speaker's Voice." That's the clunky way of describing what a TV is. This is a little different. They were really excited about the TV when it first came out, because it was amazing to watch. But you see this line here: "Commercial Use in Doubt." And here, too, the first TVs came around in the mid-1920s. It wasn't until the 1950s that it was a pretty viable, sustainable commercial enterprise. It took a quarter of a century to get there. This is really interesting. It was true for penicillin, as well. Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin pretty much by accident in 1928. And if you had to make a list of the most important discoveries or inventions of the 20th century, penicillin would be at or near the top. Depending on whose estimates you use, penicillin saved between 80 to 200 million lives since it was put into practice. It's a huge gap, but whatever the number is, it's enormous. It wasn't until 1942 -- so 14 years after discovery -- that Merck, the pharmaceutical company, made 10 doses of penicillin and realized that it was actually pretty great. And the first mass-scale production actually came for D-Day in 1944. They made 2 million doses. But that was 16 years after we first discovered it. Here, too, we have more than a decade between discovering something that changes the world and convincing people that it's actually going to change the world. With any big breakthrough technology I, at least, want to think in hindsight (and I think it's common to think in hindsight) that the gap between invention and adoption is quick. And it almost never is. I think every big innovative technology follows an eight-part path that goes something like this. First when it's invented people say, "I've never heard of it. Nobody knows about it." And then after a while, they say, "I've heard of it, but I don't understand it." And then after a while they say, "I understand it, but I don't see how it's useful." And then as time goes on, they say, "I see how it could be fun for rich people, but not for me." And then they say, "I use it, but it's just a toy. It's not practical. It's just fun to play with." And then they say, "It's becoming more useful for me." And then they say, "I use it all the time." And then they say, "I could not imagine life without it." I think every innovative product goes through this cycle, and the important thing to understand is that this cycle can take decades and it rarely, if ever, takes less than five years. So what does that mean for you as an investor? That's why you're all here. I have two things for you to think about. The first is that when innovation is measured generationally, results should not be measured quarterly. You can imagine in hindsight going to Wilbur and Orville in 1904, a year after their flight, and saying, "How's revenue? How's net income? How did you perform in the last 90 days?" You can imagine going to Bill Gates in 1979 and saying, "It looks like your growth in the last quarter is kind of slowing down. This is really concerning to me." It sounds ridiculous in hindsight, because it is ridiculous in hindsight. But people do that today with companies like Google and Facebook -- that are really doing big, innovative things -- but are still judged by quarterly results. A lot of what we call "pessimism" is just impatience in disguise. This headline I found two days ago. It was perfect timing. It says: "Why the next 20 years will see a lot less technological disruption than the past 20 years." I'm not saying this is wrong. This might very well be true. But this headline is ubiquitous across time. You could go back 20 or 40 or 50 or 100 years and find the same kind of pessimism. We're always kind of stuck in this idea, this trap that we used to innovate in the past, but we don't anymore. That idea has been around for hundreds of years. It's almost always present. And I think the reason that it feels like we haven't innovated in 20 years is because it takes 20 years for us to notice what we've innovated. Marc Andreessen, who is a famous venture capitalist who started Netscape (one of the first internet browsers), told a fascinating story recently. He went to Silicon Valley in, I think, 1992. It was really early on in the internet days. And he said that even in the early '90s, there was a palpable sense in Silicon Valley that they missed the internet. That it was too late. That it was something that happened in the previous years, but if you got there in '92 or '94 or '95 it was too late. You missed it. And in hindsight, we know that's ridiculous because even in 1995 and even in 1999, that was just the early seedling days of the internet. But at the time they had this sense that it was something in the past. That the things that we're making now are not that important. Not having that much impact. That they were too late. About one year ago, Kevin Kelly, who is the executive editor of Wired magazine (Wired is a big technology magazine) was asked basically that same point ... whether we're too late to invest in technology. We've made so much progress over the last 50 years and built so many great companies: companies like Google, and Facebook, and Amazon. But is it too late? We've missed the boat and it's too late. And he gave a great three-sentence answer that I'd love to wrap up with today. He said: "The greatest products of the next 25 years have not been invented. If they have, you might not even know about them yet. You're not too late." Southwick: I remember when I bought Amazon -- way back in 2014 ... Brokamp: Wow! Southwick: ... yeah. I had this fear that I was too late and that I'd already missed my chance. But it's doubled since then! And, of course, for every Amazon in my portfolio I can show you three companies that have tanked, but that's my best example of thinking I was too late and I wasn't too late. Brokamp: That's a good one. Southwick: [00:34:25] Brokamp: That goes back to one of David's points -- that in your portfolio you're going to have losers. You're going to have losers. That's just part of what happens. But ideally you also have the Amazons. I think it was Buffett who said that he thought he was too late to buy Wal-Mart many years ago, and I think he said that he was instead sitting around sucking his thumb because he got around to it too late. He never bought it, and he totally regrets it. And Wal-Mart, at that point, had already been around for probably 25 or 30 years. He said he thought it was too late and he was wrong. So even Buffett does it. Southwick: We could also put that on a pillow. That's the show. It's edited doggedly by Rick Engdahl. For Robert Brokamp, I'm Alison Southwick. Stay Foolish everybody.

Let's examine three companies that might be acquired soon -- Reynolds American (NYSE:RAI), GNC Holdings (NYSE:GNC), and Michael Kors (NYSE:KORS). Image source: Getty Images. Reynolds American Reynolds American, the second-largest domestic tobacco maker after Altria, rallied over 20% last year as low fuel prices apparently boosted cigarette sales as people had more money to spend and its acquisition of Lorillard boosted its top-line growth. Reynolds was well-insulated from the strong dollar because it generates most of its revenue domestically, and many investors bought the stock as a dependable dividend play in a low-interest rate environment. With interest rates set to rise, Reynolds might seem vulnerable as bonds become more attractive income plays. However, Reynolds' trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 15 is much lower than Altria's P/E of 25 and the industry average of 21. Its Newport menthol brand, Vuse e-cigarettes, and "additive-free" Natural American Spirit brand are also the dominant players in their respective markets. Those qualities make Reynolds an attractive takeover target for bigger tobacco makers. British American Tobacco (NYSEMKT:BTI), which already owns 42% of Reynolds, offered to acquire the rest of the company for $56.50 per share last October. Reynolds rejected the initial offer, fueling speculation that higher bids could follow. That buyout interest, along with Reynolds' ability to keep cutting costs and raising prices to offset weaker shipments, should help it outperform its industry peers this year. GNC Holdings GNC Holdings lost 64% of its value in 2016, marking its worst full-year performance since its IPO in 2011. The nutritional-supplements retailer was crushed by competition from superstores such as Wal-Mart, warehouse retailers such as Costco, and e-tailers such as Amazon.com. Investigations regarding the efficacy of some of its supplements also exacerbated that decline. GNC's sales have fallen year over year for three straight quarters, and analysts expect its sales and earnings to respectively fall 4% and 16% this year. That losing streak is expected to continue with an average annual earnings decline of 7% over the next five years. GNC is trying to make a comeback with a pricey Super Bowl ad campaign in February, but analysts have questioned the impact of that eleventh-hour effort. Those factors seemingly make GNC an awful investment for 2017, but its trailing P/E of 4 and price-to-sales ratio of 0.3 are becoming too cheap for potential suitors to ignore. Chinese investors were reportedly thinking about buying GNC last October, but those talks have reportedly stalled. Private-equity firms could also still acquire the company, which remains the largest health- and nutritional-supplements retailer in the United States. Those suitors might cause the stock to surge, but it could also plummet if buyers fail to emerge. Michael Kors Affordable luxury retailer Michael Kors also struggled last year as its sales growth turned negative last quarter because of stiff competition from rivals such as Coach (NYSE: COH), lower mall traffic, and the cannibalization of its higher-end goods by its cheaper outlet ones. The company expects its revenue to fall 3% this year, compared with 8% growth last year. Kors initially looks like another victim of the meltdown in the retail sector caused by competition from "fast-fashion" players such as H&M and e-tailers. However, the affordable luxury market also looks ripe for consolidation. LVMH was reportedly courting Kors earlier this year, but those talks stalled out. Kors rival Kate Spade (NYSE: KATE) also recently surged on buyout rumors, with Coach being cited as a likely candidate. I believe that Kors remains a strong buyout candidate, since its P/E of 10 is much lower than Kate Spade's 19, Coach's 20, and the industry average of 26. Its P/S ratio of 1.5 is also lower than Kate's 1.8 and Coach's 2.2. The bottom line I'm not saying that Reynolds, GNC, and Kors will be acquired this year, but their low valuations and previous buyout buzz indicate that they could be taken off the market, potentially at high premiums. If those takeovers don't occur, Reynolds should hold up well, but GNC and Kors could struggle as their sales growth fades. Therefore, investors should never buy stocks based on takeover hopes alone -- they should only invest in them if they believe in their fundamental strengths and turnaround potential.

Sticky labels Next: Amazon finds cache of reused passwords: change yours now! by Lisa Vaas 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Police in Thane, India, last week busted a call center devoted to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) scamming, detaining 700 people and arresting 70 of them for allegedly calling to threaten thousands of Americans with arrest over supposedly unpaid taxes. As the Wall Street Journal tells it, police said at a news conference on Wednesday that 200 police had raided 3 bland buildings in the Mumbai suburb the night before: Police said three nondescript office buildings on the edge of this booming Mumbai suburb were packed with hundreds of people posing as Internal Revenue Service officials in a scam that has vexed Americans for years. Thousands of calls went out from nine call centers on a daily basis as the scammers tried to trick naïve Americans into handing over bank details or sending gift cards to “settle” their cases. The workers were allegedly trained to speak with American accents. According to the Guardian, Paramvir Singh, the police commissioner of Thane, said that 70 workers at the so-called “scam center” have been formally arrested, and around 630 others are being investigated. Police expect “many more” arrests, Singh said. They’ve got plenty of material to go over as they investigate: conveniently enough, the call centers kept recordings of the calls. Singh explains, We had a mole go in to the call centers to verify. The best part is that they were actually recording all their calls. We have recovered 851 hard disks on which the calls were recorded, so we’re going through those now. Employees were allegedly telling their targets that they’d defaulted on tax payments and that the IRS was set to prosecute them, Singh said: They would give an American name and a batch number and tell the [US] citizen that they owed the authorities $4,000, $5,000 or $10,000. They were instructed to stay on the phone and told that their homes would be raided by police within 30 minutes if they hung up. They made threats, they said: ‘You have to pay, otherwise you will lose your job, your money, your house.’ Police said that the crooks allegedly duped people into giving the callers their bank details. Then, they’d drain the victims’ accounts, transferring the money into a US bank account. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More Alternatively, the scammers told their victims to stay on the call and go to their nearest Target or Walmart store to buy prepaid gift cards – such as iTunes gift cards – and load them up with thousands of dollars. Police haven’t put an exact figure on how much money the call centers pulled in or whether they were targeting people from other countries. Singh did say, however, that the centers were running for over a year. He estimated that they’d managed to con thousands of people out of billions of rupees. One billion rupee converts to about $15 million USD, or about £12 million. Singh: We’ve been getting calls all morning from American citizens, people saying: ‘I think I got one of these calls. I think my money was stolen.’ At Wednesday’s news conference, Thane police played one of the call recordings they said they’d taken off the call center’s computers. The Wall Street Journal’s description: A caller with a heavy Indian accent told a man he owed more than $11,780 and was facing arrest within hours, a five-year prison term and $100,000 fine if he didn’t settle. The call was handed to a “senior treasury officer,” who told the man he can pay whatever he can afford right away by going to the nearest Walgreens to buy Apple iTunes gift cards worth $1,000. “Keep yourself on speaker and get dressed,” the man was told at one point. “We are running short of time [and] within two hours you will be taken into custody.” It turns out that the target in that particular call hadn’t actually fallen for the ruse: rather, he was just stringing along the caller to waste his time. The script for the calls is a familiar one: a variant is used in the “you didn’t show up for jury duty” scam. Both the you-owe-the-IRS-money fraud and the jury duty scam are the love children of fake support calls and lockscreen ransomware. Bogus support calls bludgeon you into paying for crooks to pretend to remove a virus infection that doesn’t exist. Lockscreen ransomware extorts payment of a pretend fine for a criminal offense you never committed. They all rely on the same type of pressure: they try to scare you to the point that your judgment jumps out the window. The details change, but the spook-you factor remains. So, “Your computer is infected and currently attacking our network with malware! We’re not happy with that, but luckily for both of us, we can help you. For a fee…” …turns into, “You’re delinquent on your tax payments! You’re in big trouble, bub, and we’re sending over the police right now! All you have to do to get out of this mess is pay this fine. Just give us your bank details, or maybe some nicely plumped-up gift cards, and we’ll let you off the hook.” A few years ago, we recorded a podcast about how to avoid fake support calls, and by extension any similar sort of high-pressure “pay a penalty, pay it now” call. If you know anyone who’s been targeted by this sort of scam, please urge them to give the podcast a listen, and help them gain the confidence to hang up at once. (These scammers are notorious for calling over and over again, ramping up the threats, if they don’t succeed right away.) LISTEN NOW (Audio player above not working? Download MP3, listen on Soundcloud or access via iTunes.) The calls may well look like they’re coming from perfectly legitimate places if you check out the caller ID numbers. But bear in mind that there are multiple reasons why a legitimate-looking caller ID might be bogus. It could be that the origin of the call is being spoofed. Alternatively, scam calls often come from outside your own country via a VoIP (voice over IP) service and emerge into the telephone network from some local provider, which not only makes the caller seem nearby but also saves the scammers a small fortune in call costs. What to do? Callers can be convincing: they may know a lot about you, may spoof the caller ID so the call looks like it’s legitimately from the IRS, and/or may use fake names and bogus IRS identification badge numbers. The IRS has published this list of things it never, ever does. They’re a tell-tale sign that a call’s a scam: The IRS will never call to demand immediate payment. Nor will legitimate IRS agents call about taxes owed without first having mailed you a bill. The IRS doesn’t demand that you pay taxes without giving you the opportunity to question or appeal the amount they say you owe. The IRS doesn’t require you to use a specific payment method for your taxes, such as a prepaid debit card. The IRS doesn’t ask for credit or debit card numbers over the phone. The IRS doesn’t threaten to bring in local police or other law-enforcement groups to have you arrested for not paying. Nor does the IRS use unsolicited email, text messages or any social media to discuss your personal tax issue. If you do get a phone call from someone claiming to be from the IRS and asking for money, the IRS has this advice: If you know you owe taxes or think you might owe, call the IRS at 1.800.829.1040. The IRS workers can help you with a payment issue. If you know you don’t owe taxes or have no reason to believe that you do, report the incident to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) at 1.800.366.4484 or at www.tigta.gov. You can file a complaint using the FTC Complaint Assistant; choose “Scams and Rip-offs” and then “Impostor Scams.” If the complaint involves someone impersonating the IRS, include the words “IRS Telephone Scam” in the notes.

However, retailers fear a reduction in spending as inflation begins to erode real earnings growth in 2017.Sterling's devaluation since the Brexit vote - down 12 percent against other major currencies - has also driven up supermarkets' import costs, as have commodity price increases. They also face further cost pressures from the national minimum wage, business rates and utilities. There are also signs that Asda, the British arm of Wal-Mart, will make life tougher for rivals in 2017.Analysts say a new management team is starting to make an impact, putting more staff on the shop floor and generally improving store standards. While underlying sales slumped 5.8 percent in its third quarter, they anticipate a significant improvement when it reports fourth quarter results next month.Analysts expect Tesco (on Jan. 12) to report UK like-for-like sales growth of 1.25 to 2 percent for its third quarter to Nov. 26 and growth of 0.6 to 1.5 percent for the six weeks to Jan. 7, building on four straight quarters of underlying growth. Morrisons (on Jan. 10) is expected to report underlying sales growth of 1.1 percent for the nine weeks to Jan. 1, according to an average of analysts' forecasts, a fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Sainsbury's (on Jan. 11) could be perceived as the relative loser of the three, with analysts on average forecasting a like-for-like sales fall of 0.8 percent for its third quarter to Jan. 7, though it is still expected to report volume growth and underlying sales growth at Argos of 1.5 percent. However, it is important to note that Sainsbury's, unlike Tesco and Morrisons, is not in turnaround mode and has not had to rebase its like-for-like sales performance.Updates due next week from a raft of other UK retailers, including from Marks & Spencer, department stores John Lewis and Debenhams, Primark owner AB Foods and ASOS.L, will also shine a light on prospects for the sector. Marks & Spencer will (on Jan. 12) report on its third quarter to Dec. 31. Analysts are on average forecasting like-for-like sales growth in its clothing and home division of 0.2 percent with underlying sales in its food business down 0.4 percent.Such an outcome in clothing would represent an improvement on the second quarter's 2.9 percent fall and provide some encouragement to investors that new boss Steve Rowe's turnaround plan has found some traction. Last week rival Next reported disappointing Christmas sales, cut its profit forecast and highlighted "exceptional" levels of uncertainty in the sector.

JOHN: Eggs, bacon, phone charge cords valued commodities ROBERT ST. JOHN: Eggs, bacon, phone charge cords valued commodities Posted on January 8, 2017 by Daily Journal in Food, Lifestyle ST. JOHN The items we assign value to tend to change throughout our lives. In 1987, I was 26 years old and had just opened our first restaurant. My dream at that time was to one day own a restaurant in Aspen, Colorado, and a restaurant in Destin, Florida. The idea was that the seasons are so opposite I could spend half of the year at my restaurant in the snow and half of the year at my restaurant in the sand. That dream lasted only a few years. Today I know it’s better to visit those locales and stay in a place I only have to pay for the week I am there. I can leave the restaurant business to the locals, which allows me to enjoy snow or sand. I guess automobiles meant something to me at one period of my life. I have always seen a vehicle as something to get me from point A to point B. As long as it has four good tires, an air-conditioner that blows really cold, a good stereo, and comfortable seats, I am good to go. I went through a clothing phase in my 30s. Now that I’m fat, in my 50s, and a couple of cheeseburgers away from shopping at the big-and-tall store, I value comfort over style. Actually, I am probably not too far away from always wearing those old-man-work-in-the-yard coveralls along with a pair of thick-soled old-dude Wal-Mart sneakers, and I’m OK with that. It’s all about priorities. Today the most precious non-human commodities in my home are bacon, eggs, and iPhone charge cords. The bacon and eggs can be explained. The charge cord dilemma baffles me. I have a 19-year-old daughter who goes through cell phone charge cards at an alarming rate. She is a walking, talking black hole for cords. For years I suspected she had some type of secret Ebay store set up on the black-market that sold nothing but stolen cell phone charge cords. They disappear daily. I have gone to drastic measures in our home to protect my charge cords. I have written my name on the tips of cords (not an easy task by the way). I have tried to purchase ugly, child-themed cords that she might not steal. We even filled her Christmas stocking with dozens of charge cords. They were gone within days. That little girl is dang near close to perfect in every aspect of her life, but she is – without a doubt – a hardened, stealthy, and sneaky iPhone charge-cord thief. The 15-year-old boy seems to be able to hang on to his charge cords (as long as his sister isn’t stealing them), we just can’t keep enough eggs and bacon in the house to last more than a day or two. As a kid, the two most precious food commodities in my home were milk and ketchup. We always seemed to run out of those two items as my brother and I would fight over the remains in the bottom of a bottle or carton. At my current home, it’s all about eggs and bacon. I don’t know how any individual can eat so much of those two items. The human disposal that is my teenage son can almost eat his weight in bacon, and at 6’1” and 205 pounds, that’s a lot of pork for one fork. He eats six eggs and four pieces of bacon every morning. Or is it four eggs and six pieces of bacon. I’m not sure, because it’s my wife’s job to keep the human disposal filled and fed, and she works hard at it. We purchase eggs by the flat and bacon in multiple pound containers. We should live on a farm, though it would have to be a pretty big farm with dozens of chickens and pigs to get us through the month. I’d be able to wear my old-man coveralls on the farm, but I’d have to trade in those sneakers for some work boots. The human disposal is actually a good cook. His preferred method for cooking bacon is in the oven. I like that. That’s how we cook bacon at the restaurant. We have to cook so much that we lay it all out on full-size sheet pans lined with parchment paper and pop them into a 400-degree oven. I prefer to cook bacon in my grandmother’s cast iron skillet. I will use a microwave if I am in a hurry and/or need the bacon extra crisp. I only cook bacon in the oven when I am cooking for a crowd. Though my son is considered a crowd when it comes to bacon consumption. I have to go now. The battery on my phone is dead from lack of charging, and I have to put on my coveralls and sneakers so I can go to the grocery store to purchase more bacon. Wonder if I can pull of that look in Aspen? Robert St. John is a restaurateur, chef and author of numerous books. Click here to leave a comment!

News Stocks Technology Science Tech Space Human Earth Health Politics World Videos The Tape Latest Follow WSP Newsletter RSS Facebook Twitter Google+ Search for: HomeNewsAmazon (AMZN) Stock: The Best Is Yet To Come Amazon (AMZN) Stock: The Best Is Yet To Come 2016 was a great year for Amazon. 2017 is bound to be even better. January 8, 2017 WSP In spite of the negative side effect caused by incoming president Donald Trump’s accusations against The Washington Post (which happens to be indirectly owned by Jeff Bezos who is Amazon’s CEO), the future of online retail giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) still seems to be looking up, not down. Even if the company failed to meet its forecasted earnings, specifically in the third quarter of 2016, the reasons are actually justifiable. Their shipping costs rose. And they spent quite a lot on logistics, fulfillment centers, transport vehicles and product development. All these are investments, of course, with the end result expected to be big returns. Competition is tough and getting tougher. But there’s a lot going for Amazon that will keep it ahead of everyone else it is competing against. First, there’s no other way to say it: Amazon is at its prime. At the end of the holiday season, Amazon Prime’s membership soared to its highest level ever. Provided Amazon keeps up whatever it’s doing to drive Prime memberships up and hook Prime members into spending more, there’s no reason to think that the company’s growth cannot be sustained. Second, online spending is continuing to increase. And if we use the holiday season sales figures as reference, it’s easy to see that Amazon is way up there. Based on a report by CNBC, Amazon got the highest share in online spending in the U.S., ahead of its rivals including Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), Macy’s (NYSE:M), Target (NYSE:TGT) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT). Third, Amazon is relentless in its innovation efforts. It started with online selling, but it has now branched out to brick-and-mortar selling through Amazon Books and Amazon Go. And let’s not take for granted the fact that these are no ordinary stores. In particular, Amazon Go is one that does not have any checkout counters. It makes use of what they’re calling ‘Just Walk Out Technology’ because all customers have to do is walk in, grab what they want, and walk out. Everything they bring out will simply be charged to their Amazon account. This year, Amazon also has plans to open several pop-up stores in selected U.S. shopping malls. Aside from expanding their sales channels, Amazon also has some pretty impressive products of its own. Do we even need to elaborate on Echo and Echo Dot which were certifiable blockbuster products last year? And then there’s Amazon’s diverse delivery services. First there were trucks. And then there were drones. There’s also Amazon Flex — their Uber-like service. Self-driving trucks are coming too. With more delivery options comes faster delivery service. And with a better delivery service, it’s easier to keep customers constantly satisfied and always wanting to purchase more. Fourth, Amazon has already built quite a reputation. Which is why online shoppers typically start their search with Amazon, before they widen their search to other retailers or make use of a search engine. A report by BloomReach (a marketing company) confirms this. Lastly, there’s cloud computing. Through Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company has gained another segment of the market, mostly startups and those other companies who are in need of cloud computing services. As the world goes deeper into the digital age, the business of cloud computing has no way to go but up, up, up. Which promises even more revenue for Amazon. Not just this year, but probably much more in the next several years. And to add to the noise level, take a look at Amazon stock – currently trading around the $800 level – up 27 percent on a year-over-year basis, and the company’s fundamentals : $18.35 billion in cash in most recent quarter $67.71 billion trailing-12 total assets $13.38 billion total equity $128 billion trailing-12 revenue $596 million annual net income $7.33 billion free cash flow Profit, Operating Margin 1.64%, 3.16%, respectively. If all these facts aren’t enough to discourage Amazon skeptics, we don’t know what will.

Share story By Matt Day Seattle Times technology reporter LAS VEGAS — Wares from RCA, formerly the Radio Corporation of America, have been at CES since the technology show was born 50 years ago. For much of that time, though, RCA technically hasn’t existed as an independent business. Since the late 1980s, RCA has been a rented brand name slapped on products made under contract by companies from Toronto to the Philippines and China. CES, formerly the Consumer Electronics Show, showcases products made by some of the biggest manufacturing giants in the world, including Samsung, Toyota and Intel. It’s also a locus of the strange relationships wrought by capitalism. CES’ halls these days are filled with dozens of component manufacturers, many based in Asia, vying for business from companies with name recognition among consumers. That means the name on a finished television or smartphone often has little to do with what’s inside, or the people who made it.

Branding matters in technology. Many consumers don’t take the time to find out what makes gadgets tick. Marketing and the value that people assign to it help explain why Apple and Samsung products command a higher price than devices built by other companies. Hisense, a Chinese company best known in the U.S. for selling discount TVs at Wal-Mart, two years ago bought rights to sell Sharp-branded TVs in the U.S. The company’s gargantuan booth here mixes Hisense-branded TVs with those labeled with the name of the Japanese electronics firm from which it bought a brand. Across the Las Vegas Convention Center sat Kodak. Or, rather, two Kodaks. One is the successor to the legendary New York photo company that went bankrupt in 2012. The other, Kodak Pixpro, was created in 2013 when old Kodak was restructuring its debt pile. The company licensed the rights to sell Kodak-branded cameras to JK Imaging, a little-known outfit led by an executive at a Florida electronics distributor. Kodak Pixpro employs about 30 people between a Los Angeles office and a few sales and marketing hands in Europe. They were at CES primarily to showcase a line of cameras aimed at capturing video for virtual reality. “People see the Kodak name, and say, ‘Hey, can you sponsor this, invest in that?’” said Tracy Christall, JK Imaging’s marketing director. She often has to say no, telling people the company isn’t related to the other Kodak. Natalie Mizik, who studies marketing at the University of Washington Foster School of Business, says the value that consumers attach to brand names can last longer in high-tech businesses than other industries.   Pam Kunick-Cohen is trying to extend the life span of RCA. She works at Technicolor, the French conglomerate that owns the rights to RCA. The name traces its roots to 1919, when the U.S. government ended a wartime monopoly on radio technology. RCA grew into a giant, founding what became NBC and acquiring interests ranging from record players to rental cars. Research conducted by the company’s laboratories helped bring about color television, liquid crystal displays, and VCRs. The company was acquired by General Electric in 1986 and sold for parts. Now, RCA-branded products are built by contract manufacturers with a mandate to try to keep up with new technologies while making reasonably priced products. “We’re not going to be out there trying to out-innovate Samsung or LG,” Kunick-Cohen said. RCA customers tend to be residents of middle America, she said, shoppers who encounter RCA products at Target, Kmart or Wal-Mart. They also tend to skew older, folks who remember the earlier RCA. “We still have an amazing amount of market awareness for a brand that hasn’t been as active as it was 30 years ago,” Kunick-Cohen said. “The interesting part of this business model is the consumer often doesn’t know.” Matt Day: 206-464-2420 or mday@seattletimes.com.

Britain keeps the world waiting for EU divorce papers Britain's FTSE sets fresh record high on first trading day of 2017 By James Davey Britain's three quoted major supermarkets are expected to report this week that they enjoyed solid Christmas trading, though investor concern about a potential squeeze on consumer spending in 2017 means the focus is on their outlooks. Shares in market leader Tesco and Morrisons, the UK's fourth biggest grocer, soared 38 percent and 55 percent respectively in 2016, reflecting a recovery in trading. That coincided with a slowdown in sales growth at German discounters Aldi, which will update on Christmas on Jan. 9, and Lidl as Britain's traditional supermarkets cut their prices, and continued problems at sector laggard Asda, the No. 3 player. The share price of No. 2 Sainsbury's was held back by uncertainty over the merits of its 1.1 billion pounds ($1.36 billion) takeover of household goods retailer Argos. Robust growth in consumer spending has been one of the main factors sustaining Britain's economy since last June's vote to leave the European Union. However, retailers fear a reduction in spending as inflation begins to erode real earnings growth in 2017. Sterling's devaluation since the Brexit vote - down 12 percent against other major currencies - has also driven up supermarkets' import costs, as have commodity price increases. They also face further cost pressures from the national minimum wage, business rates and utilities. There are also signs that Asda, the British arm of Wal-Mart, will make life tougher for rivals in 2017. Analysts say a new management team is starting to make an impact, putting more staff on the shop floor and generally improving store standards. While underlying sales slumped 5.8 percent in its third quarter, they anticipate a significant improvement when it reports fourth quarter results next month. Analysts expect Tesco (on Jan. 12) to report UK like-for-like sales growth of 1.25 to 2 percent for its third quarter to Nov. 26 and growth of 0.6 to 1.5 percent for the six weeks to Jan. 7, building on four straight quarters of underlying growth. Morrisons (on Jan. 10) is expected to report underlying sales growth of 1.1 percent for the nine weeks to Jan. 1, according to an average of analysts' forecasts, a fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Sainsbury's (on Jan. 11) could be perceived as the relative loser of the three, with analysts on average forecasting a like-for-like sales fall of 0.8 percent for its third quarter to Jan. 7, though it is still expected to report volume growth and underlying sales growth at Argos of 1.5 percent. However, it is important to note that Sainsbury's, unlike Tesco and Morrisons, is not in turnaround mode and has not had to rebase its like-for-like sales performance. Updates due next week from a raft of other UK retailers, including from Marks & Spencer, department stores John Lewis and Debenhams, Primark owner AB Foods and ASOS.L, will also shine a light on prospects for the sector. Marks & Spencer will (on Jan. 12) report on its third quarter to Dec. 31. Analysts are on average forecasting like-for-like sales growth in its clothing and home division of 0.2 percent with underlying sales in its food business down 0.4 percent. Such an outcome in clothing would represent an improvement on the second quarter's 2.9 percent fall and provide some encouragement to investors that new boss Steve Rowe's turnaround plan has found some traction.

However, it is important to note that Sainsbury’s, unlike Tesco and Morrisons, is not in turnaround mode and has not had to rebase its like-for-like sales performance. Updates due next week from a raft of other UK retailers, including from Marks & Spencer, department stores John Lewis and Debenhams, Primark owner AB Foods and ASOS.L, will also shine a light on prospects for the sector. Marks & Spencer will (on Jan. 12) report on its third quarter to Dec. 31. Analysts are on average forecasting like-for-like sales growth in its clothing and home division of 0.2 percent with underlying sales in its food business down 0.4 percent. Such an outcome in clothing would represent an improvement on the second quarter’s 2.9 percent fall and provide some encouragement to investors that new boss Steve Rowe’s turnaround plan has found some traction. Last week rival Next reported disappointing Christmas sales, cut its profit forecast and highlighted “exceptional” levels of uncertainty in the sector.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 4:20 PM, January 8, 2017 Updated: 4:40 PM, January 8, 2017 Britain's three quoted major supermarkets are expected to report this week that they enjoyed solid Christmas trading, though investor concern about a potential squeeze on consumer spending in 2017 means the focus is on their outlooks. Shares in market leader Tesco <TSCO.L> and Morrisons <MRW.L>, the UK's fourth biggest grocer, soared 38 percent and 55 percent respectively in 2016, reflecting a recovery in trading. That coincided with a slowdown in sales growth at German discounters Aldi <ALDIEI.UL>, which will update on Christmas on Jan. 9, and Lidl <LIDUK.UL> as Britain's traditional supermarkets cut their prices, and continued problems at sector laggard Asda, the No. 3 player. The share price of No. 2 Sainsbury's was held back by uncertainty over the merits of its 1.1 billion pounds ($1.36 billion) takeover of household goods retailer Argos. Robust growth in consumer spending has been one of the main factors sustaining Britain's economy since last June's vote to leave the European Union. However, retailers fear a reduction in spending as inflation begins to erode real earnings growth in 2017. Sterling's devaluation since the Brexit vote - down 12 percent against other major currencies - has also driven up supermarkets' import costs, as have commodity price increases. They also face further cost pressures from the national minimum wage, business rates and utilities. There are also signs that Asda, the British arm of Wal-Mart <WMT.N>, will make life tougher for rivals in 2017. Analysts say a new management team is starting to make an impact, putting more staff on the shop floor and generally improving store standards. While underlying sales slumped 5.8 percent in its third quarter, they anticipate a significant improvement when it reports fourth quarter results next month. Analysts expect Tesco (on Jan. 12) to report UK like-for-like sales growth of 1.25 to 2 percent for its third quarter to Nov. 26 and growth of 0.6 to 1.5 percent for the six weeks to Jan. 7, building on four straight quarters of underlying growth. Morrisons (on Jan. 10) is expected to report underlying sales growth of 1.1 percent for the nine weeks to Jan. 1, according to an average of analysts' forecasts, a fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Sainsbury's (on Jan. 11) could be perceived as the relative loser of the three, with analysts on average forecasting a like-for-like sales fall of 0.8 percent for its third quarter to Jan. 7, though it is still expected to report volume growth and underlying sales growth at Argos of 1.5 percent. However, it is important to note that Sainsbury's, unlike Tesco and Morrisons, is not in turnaround mode and has not had to rebase its like-for-like sales performance. Updates due next week from a raft of other UK retailers, including from Marks & Spencer <MKS.L>, department stores John Lewis <JLP.UL> and Debenhams <DEB.L>, Primark owner AB Foods <ABF.L> and ASOS.L <ASOS.L>, will also shine a light on prospects for the sector. Marks & Spencer will (on Jan. 12) report on its third quarter to Dec. 31. Analysts are on average forecasting like-for-like sales growth in its clothing and home division of 0.2 percent with underlying sales in its food business down 0.4 percent. Such an outcome in clothing would represent an improvement on the second quarter's 2.9 percent fall and provide some encouragement to investors that new boss Steve Rowe's turnaround plan has found some traction.

Morrisons (on Jan. 10) is expected to report underlying sales growth of 1.1 percent for the nine weeks to Jan. 1, according to an average of analysts' forecasts, a fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Sainsbury's (on Jan. 11) could be perceived as the relative loser of the three, with analysts on average forecasting a like-for-like sales fall of 0.8 percent for its third quarter to Jan. 7, though it is still expected to report volume growth and underlying sales growth at Argos of 1.5 percent. However, it is important to note that Sainsbury's, unlike Tesco and Morrisons, is not in turnaround mode and has not had to rebase its like-for-like sales performance. Updates due next week from a raft of other UK retailers, including from Marks & Spencer, department stores John Lewis and Debenhams, Primark owner AB Foods and ASOS.L, will also shine a light on prospects for the sector. Marks & Spencer will (on Jan. 12) report on its third quarter to Dec. 31. Analysts are on average forecasting like-for-like sales growth in its clothing and home division of 0.2 percent with underlying sales in its food business down 0.4 percent. Such an outcome in clothing would represent an improvement on the second quarter's 2.9 percent fall and provide some encouragement to investors that new boss Steve Rowe's turnaround plan has found some traction. Last week rival Next reported disappointing Christmas sales, cut its profit forecast and highlighted "exceptional" levels of uncertainty in the sector.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Sunday, 8 January 2017 | MYT 4:28 PM Solid Christmas for UK supermarkets before uncertain 2017 LONDON: Britain's three quoted major supermarkets are expected to report this week that they enjoyed solid Christmas trading, though investor concern about a potential squeeze on consumer spending in 2017 means the focus is on their outlooks. Shares in market leader Tesco and Morrisons , the UK's fourth biggest grocer, soared 38 percent and 55 percent respectively in 2016, reflecting a recovery in trading. That coincided with a slowdown in sales growth at German discounters Aldi, which will update on Christmas on Jan. 9, and Lidl as Britain's traditional supermarkets cut their prices, and continued problems at sector laggard Asda, the No. 3 player. The share price of No. 2 Sainsbury's was held back by uncertainty over the merits of its 1.1 billion pounds ($1.36 billion) takeover of household goods retailer Argos. Robust growth in consumer spending has been one of the main factors sustaining Britain's economy since last June's vote to leave the European Union. However, retailers fear a reduction in spending as inflation begins to erode real earnings growth in 2017. Sterling's devaluation since the Brexit vote - down 12 percent against other major currencies - has also driven up supermarkets' import costs, as have commodity price increases. They also face further cost pressures from the national minimum wage, business rates and utilities. There are also signs that Asda, the British arm of Wal-Mart , will make life tougher for rivals in 2017. Analysts say a new management team is starting to make an impact, putting more staff on the shop floor and generally improving store standards. While underlying sales slumped 5.8 percent in its third quarter, they anticipate a significant improvement when it reports fourth quarter results next month. Analysts expect Tesco (on Jan. 12) to report UK like-for-like sales growth of 1.25 to 2 percent for its third quarter to Nov. 26 and growth of 0.6 to 1.5 percent for the six weeks to Jan. 7, building on four straight quarters of underlying growth. Morrisons (on Jan. 10) is expected to report underlying sales growth of 1.1 percent for the nine weeks to Jan. 1, according to an average of analysts' forecasts, a fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Sainsbury's (on Jan. 11) could be perceived as the relative loser of the three, with analysts on average forecasting a like-for-like sales fall of 0.8 percent for its third quarter to Jan. 7, though it is still expected to report volume growth and underlying sales growth at Argos of 1.5 percent. However, it is important to note that Sainsbury's, unlike Tesco and Morrisons, is not in turnaround mode and has not had to rebase its like-for-like sales performance. Updates due next week from a raft of other UK retailers, including from Marks & Spencer, department stores John Lewis and Debenhams, Primark owner AB Foods and ASOS.L, will also shine a light on prospects for the sector. Marks & Spencer will (on Jan. 12) report on its third quarter to Dec. 31. Analysts are on average forecasting like-for-like sales growth in its clothing and home division of 0.2 percent with underlying sales in its food business down 0.4 percent.

Shares in market leader Tesco and Morrisons, the UK's fourth biggest grocer, soared 38 percent and 55 percent respectively in 2016, reflecting a recovery in trading. That coincided with a slowdown in sales growth at German discounters Aldi, which will update on Christmas on Jan. 9, and Lidl as Britain's traditional supermarkets cut their prices, and continued problems at sector laggard Asda, the No. 3 player. The share price of No. 2 Sainsbury's was held back by uncertainty over the merits of its 1.1 billion pounds ($1.36 billion) takeover of household goods retailer Argos. Robust growth in consumer spending has been one of the main factors sustaining Britain's economy since last June's vote to leave the European Union. However, retailers fear a reduction in spending as inflation begins to erode real earnings growth in 2017. Sterling's devaluation since the Brexit vote - down 12 percent against other major currencies - has also driven up supermarkets' import costs, as have commodity price increases. They also face further cost pressures from the national minimum wage, business rates and utilities. There are also signs that Asda, the British arm of Wal-Mart, will make life tougher for rivals in 2017. Analysts say a new management team is starting to make an impact, putting more staff on the shop floor and generally improving store standards. While underlying sales slumped 5.8 percent in its third quarter, they anticipate a significant improvement when it reports fourth quarter results next month. Analysts expect Tesco (on Jan. 12) to report UK like-for-like sales growth of 1.25 to 2 percent for its third quarter to Nov. 26 and growth of 0.6 to 1.5 percent for the six weeks to Jan. 7, building on four straight quarters of underlying growth. Morrisons (on Jan. 10) is expected to report underlying sales growth of 1.1 percent for the nine weeks to Jan. 1, according to an average of analysts' forecasts, a fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Sainsbury's (on Jan. 11) could be perceived as the relative loser of the three, with analysts on average forecasting a like-for-like sales fall of 0.8 percent for its third quarter to Jan. 7, though it is still expected to report volume growth and underlying sales growth at Argos of 1.5 percent. However, it is important to note that Sainsbury's, unlike Tesco and Morrisons, is not in turnaround mode and has not had to rebase its like-for-like sales performance. Updates due next week from a raft of other UK retailers, including from Marks & Spencer, department stores John Lewis and Debenhams, Primark owner AB Foods and ASOS.L, will also shine a light on prospects for the sector. Marks & Spencer will (on Jan. 12) report on its third quarter to Dec. 31. Analysts are on average forecasting like-for-like sales growth in its clothing and home division of 0.2 percent with underlying sales in its food business down 0.4 percent. Such an outcome in clothing would represent an improvement on the second quarter's 2.9 percent fall and provide some encouragement to investors that new boss Steve Rowe's turnaround plan has found some traction. Last week rival Next reported disappointing Christmas sales, cut its profit forecast and highlighted "exceptional" levels of uncertainty in the sector.

NFL mix will create a ratings nightmare Jan. 7, 2017 Updated 6:49 p.m. 1 of 1 By TOM HOFFARTH / STAFF COLUMNIST Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF MEASURING MEDIA MAYHEM WHAT SMOKES • Our recommendation again for Monday's college football national championship game between Alabama and Clemson (5 p.m., ESPN) is to go sideways with the "Megacast" offering (in its third year) and stick with ESPNEWS and the "Coaches Film Room." Brian Griese will be joined by head coaches Dino Babers (Syracuse), PJ Fleck (formerly of Western Michigan, now with Minnesota), Matt Rhule (Baylor), Mark MacIntyre (Colorado) and Mark Helfrich (recently fired by Oregon), all huddled in a room in Bristol, Conn. They also offer fewer commercial breaks. • Where things are going: The NBA will stream its first regular season game on Facebook Live with Sunday's Golden State-Sacramento 6 p.m. contest – along with a new "NBA Mobile View" feed that enlarges the TV shot for viewing on smaller phone and tablet screens. WHAT CHOKES • USA Today columnist Christine Brennan endorses shutting it down for ESPN's Brent Musburger after his attempt to pontificate during Monday's Oklahoma-Auburn Sugar Bowl telecast about Sooners running back Joe Mixon and his assault of a female student in 2014 that resurfaced as a news story when video came out. http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/brennan/2017/01/04/brent-musburger-joe-mixon-sugar-bowl-espn/96162474/ In a conference call with reporters a few days earlier, Musburger said about the same thing, but that didn't draw headlines. You want a broadcaster to express his opinions if they're warranted without a concern about torch bearers coming after him. The situation could easily have been addressed without opinions given during the game. On our TV, Musburger stays a long as he wants. The wall shall be constructed appropriately, with old twisted TV antennas and rusted-out satellite dishes, stacked as high as the rooftops, all bound together with high-speed cable. If more materials are needed, submit a requisition to your local provider, which has that secret discretionary account from all those monthly surcharges for those who add extra regional sports channels. If L.A. NFL fans build this barrier around the perimeter of the city, do the Chargers dare come? The nuts and Bolts in all this suggest that, along with the Rams, this stands to be a two-team pro football town again, co-tenants in Stan Kroenke’s Inglewood Wal-Mart/Performing Arts Center. We could know as soon as this week. Two runners-up for the price of one major TV headache. The Rams’ return after their extended absence already showed in 2016 that L.A. doesn’t get the top choice of games each week, no matter how things can be manipulated. Add a second team, and a typical Sunday three-game parlay crushes the flexibility even more, based on AFC and NFC contract rights deals with CBS and Fox. The only logical way to appease the masses if offering some leniency to KCBS/2 and Fox/11 to opt into as many Raiders’ appearances as possible – wherever they may be. Do the numbers lie? The Rams’ uninspired first regular season back in L.A. can be best encapsulated with the 12 appearances on the Fox/11 affiliate (there also were two that went to KCBS/2, one to KNBC/4 and the opener to ESPN). Those Fox/11 games registered an 8.3 local rating – that’s about 8 percent of all the TVs in the city – and a 20 percent share of all TVs turned on, accounting for an average of 669,000 viewers. In all NFL Fox games, Rams or otherwise, the L.A. average was about the same, a stale 8.0. The Chargers, meanwhile, who continue to be a nuisance in claiming L.A. as a secondary market, requiring must-airs by KCBS/2 when they’re on the road, made it on nine times in L.A. this season on that channel. They averaged a 6.6 rating/15 share (535,000 average viewers). The 4-12 Rams and 5-11 Chargers were almost unwatchable after Week 4. The 12-4 Raiders, however, made things a bit more tolerable when CBS was in a doubleheader week, or KCBS could get permission to bend rules a bit late in the season. It ended up that the Raiders made 10 appearances on KCBS this season, averaging a 9.0 rating and 22 share for 794,000 viewers. It didn’t hurt that the Raiders won eight of those 10 contests. Last Sunday’s TV convergence of all three teams may not be the best example to also bring up here, but it ultimately demonstrates that in the Raiders vs. Rams vs. Chargers pecking order for Southern California, even the New York Times thought enough of the strange dynamics that it created a front-page sports story about it last Sunday. http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/31/sports/los-angeles-raiders-rams-fans-national-football-league.html?_r=0) On Jan. 1, KCBS/2 got the OK to carry Raiders-Broncos (with playoff seeding implications) at 1:25 p.m., since the Chargers-Chiefs were in San Diego. It went directly up against Rams-Cardinals on KTTV/11 (with nothing at stake). KCBS was doing an 11.0 rating/25 share (942,000 viewers) even as the Broncos went out to a 24-0 lead over the Raiders in third quarter. At that point, CBS made the call to swap in Chargers-Chiefs, even though Kansas City had just taken a 26-17 lead at the switching point. L.A., maybe curious about what the last Chargers game in San Diego might look like, stuck around to produce an 8.2 rating/18 share (703,000 viewers) from 3:30 p.m. until the end. All the while on Fox/11, the Rams-Cardinals slogged through a 5.0 rating/11 share (380,000 viewers). From our TV vantage point, L.A. NFL fans have nothing really to look forward to if a) the Chargers decide to come into town now, or even delay it until the 2019 stadium is finished because of the secondary market status, or b) the Rams don’t improve fast. Two teams in L.A. only exacerbate the need for DirecTV’s “NFL Sunday Ticket” so games of national interest aren’t regularly blacked out. Otherwise, the NFL has to be more creative in funneling one of the two L.A. teams to a Thursday night, a Sunday night, a Sunday morning in London (already happening) or a Monday night to avoid that Sunday morning/afternoon congestion that otherwise chokes off the No. 2 TV market in the country. Again, unless the Raiders, who unfortunately couldn’t get past the wild-card round of these NFL playoffs, find their way back home again. Right? “A one year snapshot of ratings for any team can be misleading as ratings ebb and flow over time,” said Amy Trask, the former Raiders’ CEO, current NFL analyst for CBS and author with her new autobiography, “You Negotiate Like A Girl: Reflections on a Career in the National Football League.” https://www.amazon.com/You-Negotiate-Like-Girl-Reflections/dp/1629371874 “If the Rams make adjustments that suggest to the fan base that the team will be headed in the right direction, there will be greater fan avidity,” Trask added. “And, of course, if the Rams start winning that too will help with ratings. All of that holds true for the Chargers as well. “And yes, certainly the Raiders have strong support in this market but so too can the Rams and Chargers. I wouldn’t make sweeping conclusions based on a one-year snapshot.” You might also picture this: The citizenry of St. Louis, which still managed to average a 19.7 rating for 12 Rams home games a year ago, thanking us for freeing up their Sunday choices. A BERMAN WITH A PLAN ESPN announced Thursday morning that it will air an hour-long show documenting Chris Berman’s “career and impact” called “He Did Go All The Way” on Feb. 2, at 7:30 p.m. http://espnmediazone.com/us/press-releases/2017/01/chris-berman-assume-new-espn-role-nfl-season/ Sounds rather funerary, but …. Has someone’s shot-clock expired? Only as far as Berman hosting the network’s Sunday NFL pregame show, the NFL draft and the Home Run Derby. The proverbial 800-pound elephant in the room – it takes two non-complementary clichés to make one Berman – has logged 31 years, not decades, as the “Sunday NFL Countdown” host, which accounts for half his time he has roamed the Bristol, Conn., hallways (he turns 62 in May). Months ago, It was pretty well known that, if not retiring, Berman was cutting things back, back, back. Now it’s official. Except that the way this was presented as the lead story on ESPN “SportsCenter” shows and continual scrolls throughout the day, it might have led viewers to believe that something worst had happened. First, this wasn’t news, just somewhat newsworthy. Yet the Hartford Courant put it on A1 of its Thursday edition, calling it “end to a sports television era.” http://www.courant.com/sports/hc-jacobs-column-berman-espn-0106-berman-steps-aside-as-voice-of-nfl-at-espn-20170105-story.html) “This isn't a tombstone day,” Berman said in the Courant, trying to comfort the local readers. “I’m moving out of the big house and downsizing to the condo and you can bring your dog. It's all good.” ESPN Senior VP/Event & Studio Production Stephanie Druley told the Sports Business Daily about contract negotiations prior to ESPN announcing it: “It’s always been about finding the best fit, and Chris has had a say in every part of that.

A half-century after MLK's death is Baltimore less segregated? Yes and no. News Maryland Baltimore City Baltimore youngsters go on post-holiday shopping spree with city police Heroes and Helpers Lorraine Mirabella Sgt.

Sgt. Robin Blackmon of the Baltimore Police Department pushes a cart with toys that Tyonna Robinson, 8, is buying with a Target gift card during the Heroes and Helpers event Saturday at Mondawmin Mall. (Lorraine Mirabella) Lorraine MirabellaContact ReporterThe Baltimore Sun Baltimore kids buy toys and clothing during a post-holiday shopping spree with police donated by Target. Witt Butler had definite ideas of how to spend $175, and a Barbie doll and an American Girl ice cream truck ranked high on that list. The 6-year-old from Roots & Branches School in West Baltimore could take her pick of those — or other items — Saturday as she took part in a program hosted by Baltimore Police Department and Target. She joined 100 city children ranging from toddlers to teens for the Police Department's Heroes and Helpers shopping spree at Target at Mondawmin Mall. Target donated $17,500 for the event, equating to gift cards of $175 for each child. The Police Department typically sponsors the program — designed to help children build relationships with officers — before the Christmas holiday, and did host an earlier event last month at a Wal-Mart. But officials decided another event was warranted. "We started to realize that the needs of the children extend way beyond Christmas," said Detective Nicole S. Monroe, a Police Department spokeswoman. "It just seems like the need is always there. We're finding that this event is not something that should just be limited to Christmas and holiday time."

"This is definitely one of those events where a young person gets to interact with a police officer on a completely different level," she said. Sgt. Robin Blackmon walked the aisles with 8-year-old Tyonna Robinson and Tyonna's mother, Shavon Garris, helping the John Eager Howard Elementary third-grader pick out a sleeping bag, leggings and games. Blackmon complimented Tyonna on a "really good" report card and encouraged her to "keep up the good work."

Genard Barr, coach of the community team in the second annual flag football game against city police Saturday, gave his players some advice. "They can't keep up with you. They can't catch you on foot," he said to laughs on the field at Frederick Douglass... It was halftime, and the cops were in the lead.

They can't catch you on foot," he said to laughs on the field at Frederick Douglass... (Jessica Anderson) "I feel like this is a priceless job," Blackmon said. "It's a good way to build a relationship and for [kids] to see us in a different light besides taking people off the street." Heidi Herzog of West Baltimore brought her children, ages 2 to 16, to shop with officers for toys and video games. "This is the biggest help," said Herzog, adding she especially appreciated the male officers who shopped with her sons. She said the boys lost their father to gun violence. Saturday's event was part of Target's community-giving initiative, which puts $4 million a week in to communities where stores are located. The discounter sponsored similar programs at 300 stores this holiday season, said Sonya Abu-Sharar, a Target senior manager. Kate Crookston, 5, went shopping with her mother, Ashley Crookston, accompanied by Officer John Perfetto. Kate said she was buying presents for her three siblings. Perfetto, who has a son, said he was getting a rare glimpse into the world of dolls. "It's a great thing to do for the kids," he said of the event. "It's a lot of fun." lorraine.mirabella@baltsun.com Privacy Policy Copyright © 2017, The Baltimore Sun, a Baltimore Sun Media Group publication | Place an Ad Baltimore Police Department A fear grows in Brooklyn Baltimore Police Commissioner Davis, acknowledging staffing shortage, to shift 100 additional officers to patrol Ellicott City mom teaches kids about the fun in healthy cooking Breaking Sports Maryland Opinion Business Jobs Obits Advertising 34°

The three Wise County bell ringing locations collected a total of $42,672. Bell-ringers in front of Wal-Mart in Decatur raised $35,209, up from $28,000 in 2015, and the bell-ringers at Lowe’s and Brookshire’s in Bridgeport raised $7,463, up from $6,207 in 2015. Wise County Kettle Chairwoman Tana Fedric attributed the up-tick in donations to increased advertising, more volunteers and good weather. “We had someone out there ringing almost every day,” Fedric said. Fedric said the donations will mainly be used to help Wise County residents in need pay their utility bills. In the case of an emergency, like a tornado or flood, the Salvation Army may also provide relief. Fedric said that the combined Decatur and Bridgeport service units serve roughly 600 to 700 people a year. “Of course, now with more money we’re going to be able to serve more,” she said.

The Root Deadspin Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root The Grapevine Journal-isms The Root TV News Politics Culture History Lists Photos Sam’s Club’s 1st Black CEO, Rosalind Brewer, Steps Down The Root Staff1/07/17 1:56pm Filed to: News African American CEOs Black CEOs Rosalind Brewer Sam's Club Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Rosalind Brewer in 2010 Bryan Bedder/Getty Images Rosalind Brewer, the first woman and the first African American to head Sam’s Club, stepped down from her position Friday, reports Fortune. Advertisement After five years at the helm of Sam’s Club, Brewer will be replaced by John Furner, Sam's Club’s chief merchant. Although Brewer said she is leaving the $57 billion-a-year company because “she wants a new challenge,” the word is that she is leaving because Sam’s is lagging behind its main competitor, Costco. Her last day on the job will be Feb. 1. Under Brewer, Sam's Club has made large strides in e-commerce, says Fortune, but the 650-store chain has struggled to narrow the sales-growth gap with Costco, whose growth rates have been several percentage points higher than Sam's in recent years. Fortune also reports that the average household income of a Costco member is about $120,000, making it much less vulnerable to downturns in consumer spending. Advertisement Brewer joined Wal-Mart in 2006 as regional vice president, overseeing operations in Georgia. She climbed the ranks to become division president of the Southeast, and later Wal-Mart East. She became CEO of Sam’s in 2012. Brewer sparked some controversy last year when she recounted a meeting with a supplier who had no representation of women or people of color on his team during a CNN interview. “My executive team is very diverse, and I make that a priority. I demand it within my team,” Brewer shared during the interview about diversity. “Just today we met with a supplier, and the entire other side of the table was all Caucasian males. That was interesting.” Sponsored The Root contributor Charles Ellison said that the backlash Brewer faced on social media for her comments was “merely the latest in a nauseating trend of mythical white victimology. Rather than a sensible exploration of Brewer’s point, the country club went ballistic, perhaps its buttons pushed to the outer limits of what white privilege could absorb.” Brewer, No. 19 on Fortune's Most Powerful Women in business list, was one of the few top African-American executives in retail. In fact, black CEOs represent barely 1 percent of Fortune 500 company heads, even as African Americans are a little over 13 percent of the U.S. population.

Salone Monitor.com Online Reviews By Salone Monitor Search Main menu Skip to primary content Home Privacy Policy Terms Of Service Post navigation ← Previous Next → Learn to Change Your Belly Button Ring For the First Time Posted on January 7, 2017 by admin After getting a navel piercing, there are many things you should do to avoid infection and irritation. It’s important to care for the piercing as you would any wound. A stainless steel needle was pushed through your skin and it’s important to treat your new navel ring as such. After you’ve waited the recommended 6 to 12 months for your new piercing to heal, you’re probably ready to shop for some new belly button rings. They are available online, in piercing and tattoo salons, and at mall kiosks. Sometimes belly rings are available at department store jewelry counters or even discount stores like Wal-Mart and Target. No matter where you get your new body jewelry, you must follow these rules for clearing and changing your belly button rings. Before you even purchase the rings, check that they are made from a reliable material that won’t irritate your skin. Even after the piercing is healed, it may still be tender and prone to infection. The best materials for navel rings are 316L surgical steel (a form of stainless steel), titanium, Bioplast or Bioflex, 24K plated gold and 14K real gold. These materials are sanitary and strong and belly button rings made from these things are least likely to chip or break. Before inserting the belly ring, sterilize each product with warm soapy water to remove any dirt and oil. You may also autoclave your belly button rings, which is a sterilization process that uses extreme heat to rid things of any germs that can cause pain and infection. Generally, you will have to visit a tattoo or piercing salon if you want your navel rings autoclaved. When changing a ring, make sure you wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before you begin. If you have medical gloves available, you could wear those for added protection. Be sure to set your new belly ring close to where you are working so you can spend as little time as possible without anything in the piercing. Unscrew the top ball from the new belly ring that you want to insert and set it aside. On some belly button rings, only the top ball is removable, on some only the bottom ball is removable and on some both balls are removable. For ease and comfort, it is recommended that you remove the top ball. Gently grasp the bottom ball of the belly ring you are wearing firmly between your thumb and forefinger. Gently twist the top ball of the navel ring you are wearing to remove it from the barbell. Slowly pull the belly button ring down and out of your navel piercing. Immediate grab the replacement belly ring and position the ball-less part of the barbell near the inside of your belly button (where the piercing hole is). Slowly and gently apply pressure and continue until the barbell pokes through the top hole of your piercing. If this is your first time changing belly button rings, it may take a couple of tries to push it all the way through. Grab the top ball of your new ring and gently screw it on while holding the barbell still with your thumb and forefinger. After that is complete, immediately wash your hands, as well as the old belly button ring. If you follow these steps carefully, you’ll be able to change belly button rings frequently and easily.

Paint, of course. Doesn't everybody? I have four jobs. Most important to me, my main job, is about a 50-60 hour job on most weeks. Some weeks aren’t like that but the majority of my weeks are, and that’s ok because I love the pace. My other jobs require about 5-10 hours a week total, depending on how much extra income I want, as two of them are direct sales companies. Then I have this blog; which although it’s a source of income is more of a therapeutic outlet for me to vent and talk through my crazy life. I tell you all this because normally, I have 80 hours per week devoted to “stuff.” Don’t forget I’m also a single momma to Big and Little, so reallyyyyy, I have no time for really anything.  The week between Christmas and New Year’s is historically a week off for me. This year was no different but the exception was that I had no plans. NONE. Little was at home with me. I got into a really silly argument with my best friend, and had a lot on my mind in other regards. A lot; and more than normal. One morning, I woke up and decided I wanted to paint an accent wall. I went to Wal-Mart and stood at the paint swatches while Little and his “girlfriend” screamed through the aisles. The man next to me at the paint swatches asked if they were my children. I looked their direction and looked back at the man and shook my head no. I denied even knowing them. It was after Christmas; Santa had already been to see me, so I figured I was safe! I picked a dark charcoal color for an accent wall, and then got another gallon of an accent color for my kitchen. In true Holli fashion, before painting, I had taken it to Facebook for everyone’s opinion. People were encouraging the kitchen to be a variety of colors ranging from terra cotta, turquoise, to eggshell. If you are someone who uses these terms, stop it. Just say red, blue and white. It’s annoying. My mother told me that I needed to be “hip” and pick a jewel tone. I chose a color called “Caribbean Sea.” Maybe, I thought, a super-hot muscular man in a swimsuit would pop out of the pantry when I searched for pasta. Maybe a beach would magically appear outside over the Chihuahua poop covered dead grass in the backyard. You never know.  Before painting I took Little and his girl to see “Sing” at our movie theatre. I’m actually not even sure what that movie was about. My mother went with us and I could tell that within two minutes she wanted to get out of the theatre. She’s hyper-sensitive to sick people; she really should have worked for the CDC. I feel like she would really have enjoyed that job because she’s a little obsessed about researching every latest sickness out there. Anyway, the whole theatre was hacking and coughing and every time they did, she would shift uncomfortably in her chair. By hour TWO of this horrific movie with singing animals, I had enough. When I got home, I didn’t think that painting with two 4-year old’s at home would be difficult. ERROR. Don’t do this. EVER. First of all, I don’t tape things; who has time for that, for real. So I thought I could easily “stay within the lines” with my hip jewel tones except I was so incredibly stressed out about painting with children at the house that instead of an accent wall, I started painting like everything in my kitchen. Side note: one time my bestie and I drank a bottle of wine and thought my bedroom needed to be the color of the merlot we were drinking. We also didn’t tape. I woke up the next morning with red on the carpet, in my hair, on the ceiling; everywhere. I should have learned then; but didn’t. I painted jewel tone Caribbean Sea all over the kitchen, not knowing when to stop. When I thought I found a good spot, Little’s girl came in and touched the wall to see “if it was dry,” and then twirled around to “dance” and to balance herself, she touched an unpainted wall. Mmmkay. Now I had to paint THAT wall. So, in the end, not so much an “accent wall,” but really a whole complete kitchen overhaul.  The living room would be different, I thought. I had just one specific wall to paint charcoal grey. Again, without taping, I painted. I did great; in my opinion. However! My mother came over to look at the work. She walked in and squinted her little beady eyes at the wall. She made light conversation. She avoided the topic of the wall. She almost avoided the Caribbean Sea too, but finally complimented it. But the grey she said, “so, are you done with that wall?” I erupted into a major fit of rage and screamed at her about how inconsiderate and insensitive she was; and she tried to leave to go home. No! I followed her out, gently prying her for more information without leading her to believe that she was right. Also a side note: do you know you have muscles in your body called Painter’s Muscles? Yes. It’s true. They only get worked during painting. They reside in every area of your entire body; but you don’t usually feel them. Lemme tell ya; after two days of accent wall painting, I felt them.  On day 3 of the accent wall painting, I woke up barely able to get out of bed. My Painter’s Muscles were throbbing. There’s no way I’d let my Mothership win the paint war. She was wrong! My house looked great. Little’s girl came over for another play date; and I slowly dragged all the paint supplies back out again. I now have charcoal grey walls on six of my living room walls (again, not an accent) and light grey (that I miraculously had in my garage) on nine walls/space. My mother won. The two children stayed far away from me during these three days; and my Painter’s Muscle group have been restored to normal usage. We cleaned all our closets and rearranged all the furniture. Are you truly aware how dirty your home looks after you paint? Ugh, so gross. I spent the remaining days of my “vacation” and time away from work bleaching the house, doing all the laundry, and peeling candy wrappers off Big’s floor from Halloween. I was genuinely excited to return to my four jobs away from my house. I couldn’t punch any more hours into my timeclock at the house! It made my “real” work seem easy, in comparison. I give all you housewives and stay at home mothers huge props; this is a full time job that I do not want!  Tweet Related items Lipstick and Legos – Holiday Cheer (Mostly) Lipstick and Legos – The Simple Truth About Divorce Lipstick & Legos: Shopping and Carpet Stains Lipstick and Legos – A Series of Unfortunate Events Lipstick and Legos: Fido?

BY Seth Kershner Share TweetReddit2 StumbleUpon8EmailPrint Email this article to a friend your email your name recipient(s) email (comma separated) message captcha The drumbeat of anti-unionism typically begins as soon as new employees begin their training. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)   Retail is the nation’s largest employer. Since 1980, the number of jobs in retail has reportedly grown nearly 50 percent, from 10.2 to 15.1 million. At the same time, real wages for retail workers have fallen by 11 percent while on-call scheduling, involuntary part-time work and “clopening”—where workers are required to lock up the store late at night and reopen the next morning—have wreaked havoc with workers’ lives. Not surprisingly, the retail sector also has one of the lowest rates of unionization in the economy—around the 5 percent mark under which unions have virtually no influence. It didn’t used to be this way. Retail had 15 percent union density in the 1970s, according to sociologist Peter Ikeler, with the density rate in grocery stores surpassing 31 percent at its peak in 1983. But, as with the rest of the labor movement, retail unionism has taken a steep fall since the early 1980s. How did it go so wrong? “There are a lot of parts to that puzzle,” says Ikeler, a sociologist at the State University of New York College at Old Westbury and author of the book, Hard Sell: Work and Resistance in Retail Chains.  Ikeler cites the general trend towards de-unionization of the U.S. workforce and the hollowing out of the National Labor Relations Act system through case law and employer challenges. But the most important factor in the fall of retail unionism, Ikeler argues, has been employer hostility. “The climate for labor organizing in retail is pretty explicitly negative,” Ikeler says. In a case Ikeler describes in his book, the public was able to get a glimpse of Target’s anti-union strategies—including mandatory film screenings and employees threatened with dismissal for talking about the union—during a highly publicized 2011 campaign to keep the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) from organizing one of its stores on Long Island. And across the retail industry, Target is far from unique. The drumbeat of anti-unionism typically begins as soon as new employees begin their training. New worker orientations at Walmart, the nation’s leading retailer, used to include a video that featured lines like: “The truth is unions are businesses, multimillion-dollar businesses that make their money by convincing people like you and me to give them a part of our paychecks.” According to The Atlantic, labor experts who had examined the entire video after it was leaked to the press found that it contained “blatant untruths in many of the video’s pro-company and anti-union statements.” Even smaller, regional chains invest in anti-union propaganda for new hires. According to internal documents provided to In These Times by an employee of Big Y, the Massachusetts-based grocer warns new hires about signing a union authorization card since the company’s “continued success” would be “jeopardized through third party involvement.” To research his book, Ikeler interviewed workers at Macy’s and Target stores in the New York City area. Many reported knowing that managers disapproved of unions. Several Target workers told Ikeler they were sure their jobs would be in jeopardy if they advocated for unions and reported that they knew people who’d been fired for union activity. When contacted for comment, a Target spokeswoman said that the company “believes in solving issues and concerns with the help and input of our team.” “At Target we have a longstanding commitment to our team that we will work together to create an environment of mutual trust between Target and our team members,” wrote Molly Snyder. Unions’ strategic missteps While employer resistance played the biggest role in the decline of retail unionism, Ikeler believes that unions also share part of the blame. Specifically, he thinks that unions have done a lousy job of keeping workers engaged. Ikeler points out that surveys indicate that around 13 percent of grocery store workers in the New York City area say they belong to a union. This is in contrast to the unions themselves, which say they represent a much larger share of such workers in the Big Apple. “What I think this huge disparity demonstrates,” Ikeler tells In These Times, “is that there are a fair number of workers who aren’t aware they’re in a union—it’s just something that comes out of their check every month. Sure, they might be organized in some bureaucratic sense—just not in any meaningful fighting capacity.” In Ikeler’s view, labor unions need to step up their organizing and “get back to what unions were in their early New Deal days: more worker-based rather these large staff-run, top-heavy entities that give lots of money to Democratic candidates every few years with relatively little payback.” A construct that can be challenged Ikeler also sees a lot of potential in the worker center model. Worker centers like the Retail Action Project, which Ikeler has studied extensively, give workers a place to go to form communities, talk about work conditions and plan campaigns. Another clear benefit is that worker centers help cultivate a sense of occupational identity in a sector of the economy known for deskilling workers in order to make them more easily replaceable. “A strong occupational identity—where workers are very committed to a craft, to an occupation—this has often been a source of collective identity and resistance,” Ikeler says. “If workers see themselves as part of an occupational community they may be more likely to form organizations together and put up collective resistance.” Worker centers can’t replace unions, but the two types of organizations can work together. “To see success,” Ikeler says, “to see large-scale organizing and an advance for the low-wage service sector, we’re going to have to see greater synergy than we’ve previously seen between worker centers and national unions that are actually willing to take risks and use some of their treasury by going on strike.” When asked if he saw any bright spots on the retail scene today, Ikeler pointed to a recent victory by Stop & Shop workers in New England. After threatening to strike in February, the UFCW negotiated a favorable contract for its 35,000 members in the region, including a quicker route to a $15 hourly wage and a promise from the company to add 480 new full time jobs over the next three years. The victory calls to mind an uplifting passage from Hard Sell, where Ikeler writes that “bad” service jobs are “not an unalterable fact of life but a social construct that can be challenged.” Never has independent journalism mattered more.

America’s Tween Soldiers View Comments "recent victory by Stop & Shop workers" Great to learn retail workers can win. Seems the great challenges to food retail unionization would be a) rapid turnover - students going to school, or workers looking for jobs that are more challenging, or that have higher status, or higher pay - and b) ease of replacing workers by drawing on a 'short-term' labor pool. On the other hand, retail food services cannot be moved out of the country, carried out via internet, nor - despite some self-service machines in some retail outlets - significantly automated. The food industry in particular needs a sizable worker base. Union outcomes may depend on particular factors: anti-union business practices are a given that may vary from state to state; but, on the other hand, politicized support groups (political parties, civic organizations, unions, newspapers) may strengthen negotiation and strike actions. The above also goes for unionism in the building trades, where outsourcing and automation are - outside of science fiction scenarios - not possible. Spontaneous strike-action-support-groups - students w/spare time, retirees, teachers between classes, spouses not working - could look at a single 'strike actions in your community' website to join up with particular actions. Posted by abramawicz on 2017-01-10 16:52:14 Unions mainstay for years has been people with tax funded jobs. - before that they were for the laborers in the factories. They turned their backs on retail workers and minimum wage earners - guess why - they don't make enough to pay dues. Now their need to replenish and build new Political Action Committees Funds(PAC's) is driving them into every niche of society/work force. Unions have provide a much needed voice for workers in America. They brought the steel mills and auto industries throughout the 1950-2000! Now its almost all been automated - dues paying members replaced by robotic machines. What will they do for minimum wage and retail sales workers ? Just askin ?

By JeffReeves Columnist In December, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the second time since the Great Recession and added the expectation of a 2017 interest-rate hike to its forecast. And just a few days ago, the much-awaited minutes from the latest Fed meeting showed the most hawkish tone from the central bank in two years. At the same time, Europe has been plunged into political turmoil after last year’s Brexit vote and the more recent resignation of Italy’s prime minister. Elsewhere, the Bank of Japan continues down the path of negative rates and aggressive bond buying. Add it all up, and it isn’t surprising that the U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.08%  is up against 14-year highs. Investors may have missed all this talk thanks to chatter about the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.03%  once again nearly hitting 20,000. But regardless of your allocation to stocks or your investment horizon, this kind of big-picture trend in the dollar means now is the time to position your portfolio to profit — and, perhaps most important, to avoid some of the pitfalls that can come from a strong domestic currency. So what dollar trades should you consider? Here are a few ideas: Domestic plays over multinationals There’s a lot of hope for consumer stocks in 2017 thanks to an improving labor market and hopes of a stimulus under a GOP-controlled Congress and President Donald Trump. However, keep in mind that not all retailers are created equal — particularly those with overseas operations that are negatively impacted by the wide disparity in currencies right now. For instance, retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -1.24%  said unfavorable currency exchange rates shaved almost 2.5% off earnings per share in the second quarter of 2016. Or consider that in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2016, athletic apparel giant Nike Inc. NKE, +0.99%  saw its revenue growth cut in half thanks to forex pressures, from 12% year-over-year in constant currency measures to just 6% including actual currency changes. To make the most of the “reflation” trade that many investors are banking on in 2017, you have to account for the headwinds that a strong dollar are creating for multinationals right now. The best way to do that is to consider consumer plays that do the vast majority of their business here in the U.S. — for instance, Foot Locker Inc. FL, +0.28% which has been a rare bright spot in retail over the last few years. Hedged-currency ETFs Of course, if you want a stable portfolio, you can’t simply buy only domestic-focused equities. Geographic diversification is just as important as diversification across sectors and asset classes. So many investors continue to hold global plays in the interest of a well-rounded portfolio, even if it means fighting an uphill battle because of a strong dollar. CES 2017: In search of the future (3:41) Self-driving cars, wall-sized TVs, driveable luggage? In a jam-packed day, WSJ's Joanna Stern takes you through the innovation and absurdity of the massive tech tradeshow. (Photo/video: Drew Evans/The Wall Street Journal) The good news, however, is that you don’t have to resign yourself to suffering through a strong dollar and a weak euro when you invest in Europe. Nor do you have to worry about the yen-dollar exchange rate when you invest in Japan. That’s because there’s a whole family of currency-hedged ETFs to allow investors to put their money in foreign markets but avoid forex problems. Consider that Japan’s Nikkei 225 NIK, -0.73%  index is up about 25% from its July 2016 lows. The WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity Fund DXJ, +0.54%  is up 35% in the same period thanks to protection from forex problems and a slightly better-performing list of stocks — while the non-hedged iShares MSCI Japan ETF EWJ, +0.63%  is up just 10% in the same period thanks to fighting an uphill battle against a strong dollar. If you want to diversify your portfolio globally, you should consider hedged funds that include the Japan-focused DXJ, the WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity Fund HEDJ, +0.38%   to play Europe or the iShares currency Hedged MSCI EAFE ETF HEFA, +0.41% for emerging markets. Dollar index ETF If you are looking for a direct play on a rising dollar instead of investing in stocks, learning how to trade foreign exchange can seem like a daunting task. Thankfully, there’s the PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund UUP, -0.11% What is the future of bitcoin?(2:59) Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss run a bitcoin exchange on which investors trade on average $1 million in bitcoin per day. But is this cryptocurrency safe or a fad? This ETF is tied to the U.S. Dollar Index, which is a measure of the greenback against a basket of other global currencies including the yen and the euro. It’s a straight currency play, but that doesn’t make it simple or risk-free. If the dollar weakens, you’ll lose money just as if you’re investing in a stock that has fallen on hard times. And, of course, PowerShares takes a small cut of your investments along the way that adds up to 0.8% annually, or $80 a year on every $10,000 invested. Still, if you want to speculate on the dollar or hedge against a strong U.S. currency holding back other global investments on your list, it’s perhaps the easiest way to do so for most investors.

By JeffReeves Columnist In December, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the second time since the Great Recession and added the expectation of a 2017 interest-rate hike to its forecast. And just a few days ago, the much-awaited minutes from the latest Fed meeting showed the most hawkish tone from the central bank in two years. At the same time, Europe has been plunged into political turmoil after last year’s Brexit vote and the more recent resignation of Italy’s prime minister. Elsewhere, the Bank of Japan continues down the path of negative rates and aggressive bond buying. Add it all up, and it isn’t surprising that the U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.07%  is up against 14-year highs. Investors may have missed all this talk thanks to chatter about the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.03%  once again nearly hitting 20,000. But regardless of your allocation to stocks or your investment horizon, this kind of big-picture trend in the dollar means now is the time to position your portfolio to profit — and, perhaps most important, to avoid some of the pitfalls that can come from a strong domestic currency. So what dollar trades should you consider? Here are a few ideas: Domestic plays over multinationals There’s a lot of hope for consumer stocks in 2017 thanks to an improving labor market and hopes of a stimulus under a GOP-controlled Congress and President Donald Trump. However, keep in mind that not all retailers are created equal — particularly those with overseas operations that are negatively impacted by the wide disparity in currencies right now. For instance, retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -1.24%  said unfavorable currency exchange rates shaved almost 2.5% off earnings per share in the second quarter of 2016. Or consider that in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2016, athletic apparel giant Nike Inc. NKE, +0.99%  saw its revenue growth cut in half thanks to forex pressures, from 12% year-over-year in constant currency measures to just 6% including actual currency changes. To make the most of the “reflation” trade that many investors are banking on in 2017, you have to account for the headwinds that a strong dollar are creating for multinationals right now. The best way to do that is to consider consumer plays that do the vast majority of their business here in the U.S. — for instance, Foot Locker Inc. FL, +0.28% which has been a rare bright spot in retail over the last few years. Hedged-currency ETFs Of course, if you want a stable portfolio, you can’t simply buy only domestic-focused equities. Geographic diversification is just as important as diversification across sectors and asset classes. So many investors continue to hold global plays in the interest of a well-rounded portfolio, even if it means fighting an uphill battle because of a strong dollar. CES 2017: In search of the future (3:41) Self-driving cars, wall-sized TVs, driveable luggage? In a jam-packed day, WSJ's Joanna Stern takes you through the innovation and absurdity of the massive tech tradeshow. (Photo/video: Drew Evans/The Wall Street Journal) The good news, however, is that you don’t have to resign yourself to suffering through a strong dollar and a weak euro when you invest in Europe. Nor do you have to worry about the yen-dollar exchange rate when you invest in Japan. That’s because there’s a whole family of currency-hedged ETFs to allow investors to put their money in foreign markets but avoid forex problems. Consider that Japan’s Nikkei 225 NIK, -0.92%  index is up about 25% from its July 2016 lows. The WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity Fund DXJ, +0.54%  is up 35% in the same period thanks to protection from forex problems and a slightly better-performing list of stocks — while the non-hedged iShares MSCI Japan ETF EWJ, +0.63%  is up just 10% in the same period thanks to fighting an uphill battle against a strong dollar. If you want to diversify your portfolio globally, you should consider hedged funds that include the Japan-focused DXJ, the WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity Fund HEDJ, +0.38%   to play Europe or the iShares currency Hedged MSCI EAFE ETF HEFA, +0.41% for emerging markets. Dollar index ETF If you are looking for a direct play on a rising dollar instead of investing in stocks, learning how to trade foreign exchange can seem like a daunting task. Thankfully, there’s the PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund UUP, -0.11% What is the future of bitcoin?(2:59) Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss run a bitcoin exchange on which investors trade on average $1 million in bitcoin per day. But is this cryptocurrency safe or a fad? This ETF is tied to the U.S. Dollar Index, which is a measure of the greenback against a basket of other global currencies including the yen and the euro. It’s a straight currency play, but that doesn’t make it simple or risk-free. If the dollar weakens, you’ll lose money just as if you’re investing in a stock that has fallen on hard times. And, of course, PowerShares takes a small cut of your investments along the way that adds up to 0.8% annually, or $80 a year on every $10,000 invested. Still, if you want to speculate on the dollar or hedge against a strong U.S. currency holding back other global investments on your list, it’s perhaps the easiest way to do so for most investors.

CHEERS: To a fresh start.  The new year brings a chance for everyone to start off with a clean slate and a set of new goals. In the past few days we've seen government leaders -- at the county and local level --  hold their reorganization meetings and choose their new leaders and lay out goals. School boards, took, have met and reorganized, welcoming in new members, selecting their own leaders and looking ahead to how best serve students in this ever-changing world. We wish them all the best. The pay is little or none and the decisions are momentous. We ask all to do what they believe is best for their constituents and check politics or personal agendas at the door. Those who elected you will be watching. CHEERS: To Monroe Township Police for saving a local family's Christmas. A woman reported on Christmas Eve morning that someone stole more than $200 in unopened Christmas gifts from her car and returned them to a store for cash. After an investigation, police charged her boyfriend, Michael R. Jefferson II, 33, of Williamstown, with the crime. Some of these gifts were for her child. Officers working on Christmas Eve wanted to lend a hand, so Monroe Township FOP Lodge 125 bought this mom a $200 gift card from Walmart and presented it to her that day. The woman reported that the card was put to good use, according to Detective Kevin Bielski. What an outstanding gesture following a heartbreaking crime. CHEERS: To welcoming a disabled veteran to the neighborhood. Timothy Birckhead currently lives in Philly, but a non-profit group that provides houses for vets with disabilities plans to build him a new, handicapped-accessible home in Gloucester County. Homes for Our Troops has built around 230 houses around the nation and will officially welcome him to his new community with an event this Saturday morning in Glassboro. Homes for Our Troops is an important organization making a real difference in the lives of the men and woman who serve our country. If you have time this weekend, stop out at Masso's on Delsea Drive around 9:30 a.m. and help welcome him to our community. JEERS: To a troubling coincidence. We've received word that a house was shot at in Millville just before the end of year. While such an action is a cause for concern, it's even more so now that we learn the home is where a city police officer formerly lived. The house is empty now and no one was hurt, but was this a coincidence or something more sinister? Police put their lives on the line every day when they put on their uniforms and head out on duty to protect us. They face enough danger on duty, especially with the lack of respect for authority many people show them. CHEERS: To befriending felines. Exactly one year ago, we accompanied an animal rescue organization's nighttime trip into Camden City to, of all things, feed stray cats. We believed in the mission so we went along for the ride and walked away with deep remorse for these unloved creatures born into an uncaring world. Earlier this week, the Camden County Animal Shelter announced it had received a $30,000 grant from the Petco Foundation that will help it treat cats -- particularly the ones living outside in Camden City. We've been to the shelter many times and can't think of a more deserving organization nor noble cause. If you own a pet, please spay and neuter them. The exponential increase of offspring is what forces shelters across the country to euthanize animals at an alarming rate. If you do your part, shelters like Camden County's will keep doing theirs. JEERS: To the opioid epidemic. Out of all New Jersey counties, Camden County saw the highest number of fatal heroin and fentanyl overdoses in 2015. At 191 people dead, county officials and medical professionals all recognized the need to offer resources for those deep in addiction. Earlier this week, the Camden County Police Department said it has saved the lives of 260 drug overdose victims with the anti-opioid medication Narcan. Conversely, the department revealed it encountered 40 fatal overdose victims in 2016. We've worked with the county's addiction awareness task force and know the good they do.

Donald Trump has been forced to distance himself from the family firm since winning the US election. He even said: “I don’t care about my company. It doesn’t matter. My kids run it.” It is perhaps an extreme example of the pressures that swirl around the businesses at the heart of many economies, but it does signal the unique pressures which come to bear when trying to sustain an organisation through the generations. Family businesses cross a variety of cultures, religions and backgrounds. The chocolate manufacturers Rowntree’s, Fry’s and Cadbury’s, the shoemakers Clarks and the bankers Barclays and Lloyds all became large businesses after being started by Quaker families. They went into business in part because they were excluded from other aspects of public life in the 18th and 19th centuries, and along the way earned a reputation for looking after their workforces. More recent examples include small, local family retailers set up by South Asian immigrants in the UK who want to support the next generation either in the business or in another profession. Crash Family businesses can last a long time. While trying to make gold from base metals, an Armenian alchemist discovered a different type of “gold” – a metal alloy that had outstanding sound quality and power when made into musical cymbals. A few years later, in 1623, the Zildjian Cymbal Company was founded, and can be traced through 16 generations and nearly four centuries to today’s firm in Massachusetts. Many key family businesses have survived the test of time after opening ownership beyond the family, although often the original families still control a significant stake in the company. The list includes modern-day giants like Wal-Mart Stores and Ford Motors in the US, L’Oreal in France, Benetton in Italy, Samsung in Korea, Sainsbury’s in the UK and Siemens in Germany. The Indian company Tata has, however, recently been suffering in the media glare due to an acrimonious falling out between family members in senior positions. The fact is that most businesses are family owned. In the UK some 71% of all small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which employ up to 250 people are family owned. Given those multinational success stories above, it might be surprising to learn that up to 95% do not survive in family ownership by the third generation. Some reasons for this may lie in the common criticisms of family businesses. They have been accused of sometimes having poor management and discipline, inadequate funding to support growth, differing incentives between family members and a lack of formalised practices and procedures. They can fall foul of time consuming family conflict, slow decision making, risk avoidance, limited innovation and a strategy which favours the status quo rather than change. Multiple motivations So how do you build a sustainable family businesses? First, it is important to consider how the rationalities underpinning the behaviours and strategies of family firms vary from those of others, especially small businesses. Let’s assume that a well-run SME is driven entirely by “market rationalities” which focus entirely on business needs and without the interference of motivations linked to the family ownership. It can be argued then that family businesses are more likely to be profit satisficers (balancing other objectives with achieving a minimum level of profit) rather than profit maximisers. Relationships between family members – both good and bad, or short and long term – can carry over into the business and influence how things are decided. These challenge assumptions of purely economic rational decision making in family firms, particularly when combined with cognitive and behavioural biases such as preferring those who are like us, or feeling that the value of a loss is much more than that of an equivalent gain. One way of looking at family firms suggests that we should accept that the family, business and social lives of those running a company must be seen as operating together: relationships overlap; family, friends and business logic or rationalities combine to influence behaviour and decision-making. Fundamentally, family aims and values can result in business decisions that differ from non-family firms. They may be reluctant to hire people from outside the family or they may adopt technology in a less flexible way as they are tied to existing ways of doing things and to existing staff and other assets. Supporting family businesses One implication is that support for small businesses, and companies with high growth potential, should not assume that family and other firms are identical. It may be that policies need to be carefully adapted for family firms. Support such as stimulating demand, changing public attitudes towards entrepreneurship, supporting research and development and the take-up of new technology, as well as providing training, advice and financial assistance all need to be adapted to take account of the differences between family and non-family firms. Emphasis also needs to be placed on developing partnerships and engagement with others, including family members and employees.   Success for family businesses should not be considered just in terms of survival. A few family businesses will develop into future market leaders even if their ownership changes, and these need to be nurtured. As family businesses make up such a crucial part of both everyday and high growth firms, research and policies need to consider those more rounded perspectives that incorporate the complex bonds and motivations that mark family firms out from the rest. Fortunately, not all will have to factor in a startling political rise that leaves the owner preparing to move into the White House amid a media furore about many potential conflicts of interest.

The two sites are within a block of each other near the intersection of West Elk Avenue and Bemberg Road. Hartman said Big Lots is the first business to commit to locating in the former Magic Mart building. Big Lots already operates a business in a 30,000-square-foot building on the other side of town and Hartman said he has not heard from the company on whether its future plans are to have two stores in Elizabethton, or to consolidate their operations at the West Elk Avenue location. The 100,348-square-foot Magic Mart building was originally built as a Wal-Mart. The Nashville corporation called Bemberg Center Partners paid $1,175,000 to acquire the building in 2016, with the intent of attracting retailers to the property.  Hartman said Big Lots received a permit from the city’s building codes office in December and work on renovating the Big Lots portion of the building may begin at anytime. While no work has yet begun on the Magic Mart property, demolition work is already well underway on the former Firestone Tire store, 100 Bemberg Road. The building was demolished on Tuesday by Mill Creek Construction and cleanup of the debris should take about a week, according to Chris Deaderick, general manager of Mill Creek. The company is very familiar with the location, having previously worked on the Citizens Bank Stadium, just across the street from the current construction. Deaderick said American Environmental Corporation will then work on the site of the former auto repair building. Once the environmental work is completed, Deaderick said Mill Creek will fill and grade the site. Hartman said he is not at liberty to name the future restaurant that will occupy the site. The property is in a high traffic area, with Elk Avenue listed as one of the busiest streets in the Tri-Cities. The property is also crossed on the northern boundary by the Tweetsie Trail.

Located within the Snohomish County cities of Arlington and Marysville, Smokey Point is a community that’s experienced a tremendous surge of growth in the past decade. What started as a census-designated place named after an outdoor barbecue restaurant from the 1950s has become a thriving residential community and commercial center that’s virtually exploded with new apartment buildings as well as shopping, dining and health care options. Much of the retail and residential development has centered around the I-5 interchange at Highway 531. The area boasts big-name national retailers, such as Walmart, Target and Costco, in addition to several newer retail and health care developments. One such development is Smokey Point Plaza, a 24,180 square foot, mixed-use retail center made up of restaurants and specialty stores, and anchored by Rite Aid. The Marketplace at Smokey Point is an exciting new shopping center with 910,000 square feet of retail space. Anchored by Dick’s Sporting Goods, other Marketplace tenants include Party City, Hobby Lobby, Outback Steakhouse and Bonefish, Hop Jack’s restaurant, Qdoba Mexican, Aveda Hair Salon and T-Mobile. The development also includes The Lodge, an apartment complex with 182 units. Developers Steve Malsam and Len Evans – who built Snohomish Station and Mill Creek Town Center – are the masterminds behind the Marketplace. Another newer residential development, Vintage at Lakeway, is a 187-unit luxury apartment community that caters to active seniors age 55 and older, and includes state-of-the-art, resort-style amenities such as a clubhouse, lounge, fitness center and private movie theater. The Arlington Planning Commission is also in the process of reviewing design plans for a new 48-unit multi-family apartment complex called 31st Avenue Apartments. Amenities will include a more than 6,200-square-foot park and an additional 3,305 square feet of open space. The nonprofit Housing Hope will also bring its latest project, called Twin Lakes Landing, to the area. According to the plans, the development will house up to 50 homeless families and feature amenities like a community building, a playground, a central courtyard and sports courts. Recent health care facilities include The Everett Clinic Smokey Point Medical Center, which houses a variety of medical specialists. For more information on new developments in Smokey Point, call the Arlington Planning Commission at (360) 403-3551, email planning@arlingtonwa.gov or visit www.arlingtonwa.gov/index.aspx-?page=262.   Most Read Everett man allegedly threatens 2 with machete EVERETT — An Everett man landed in jail after allegedly striking two… Jan 14th, 2017 by Eric Stevick Seattle Seahawks vs. Atlanta Falcons: Game Day preview Saturday’s game between the Seattle Seahawks (10-5-1) and the Atlanta Falcons (11-5)… Jan 14th, 2017 by Nick Patterson Editorial cartoons for Saturday, Jan. 14 Editorial cartoons for Saturday, Jan. 14 Jan 14th, 2017 Flu death toll rises to 8 in Snohomish County EVERETT — This year’s influenza epidemic has now killed eight people in… Jan 14th, 2017 by Sharon Salyer Illegal parking lot highlights silt problems in area streams KENMORE — As Eric Adman paddled a canoe into the mouth of… Jan 15th, 2017 by Noah Haglund © 2017, Everett Herald and Sound Publishing, Inc.

Thousands of non-seasonal jobs are being cut as retail stores across the country close down or slash expenditures. If December is the most wonderful time of the year, then January is the most dismal. The beginning of the first quarter is the most common time to announce store closures and assess budgets. The start of the year is a popular time to announce store closures. Nearly half of annual store closings announced since 2010 have occurred in the first quarter, CNBC reports. (source) Last year, Wal-Mart stunned the country when they closed 269 stores in January. Macy’s The department store chain blames online sales for their woes. Macy’s said Wednesday it has either closed or will shutter 68 stores and cut an additional 6,200 positions at a time when shoppers are going online to buy everything from scarves to lipstick. Of the 68 stores out of 730 in total, nine closings had been previously announced and three locations have already shut down. But the retail giant revealed the locations of the remaining 59 stores, which will be shuttered by the middle of this year and affect 3,900 employees, some of whom may be offered jobs at other locations… …Additionally the retail giant says that it will be cutting “layers of management” at its central operations, and paring the number of managers supporting stores, making up the bulk of 6,200 jobs that will be lost. “We continue to experience declining traffic in our stores where the majority of our business is still transacted,” Terry Lundgren, Macy’s CEO said in a statement.  In regard to the store closings he added, “we are closing locations that are unproductive or are no longer robust shopping destinations due to changes in the local retail shopping landscape. . . .These are never easy decisions.” The news did not seem to sooth investors, with Macy’s shares plunging 8.7%, to $32.70, in after hours trading. (source) Here are the Macy’s stores that will be closing. Additionally, about 30 other stores are scheduled for closure at some point in the near future. The locations of these stores have not been disclosed. The company will close about 30 additional stores over the next few years as leases or operating covenants expire or sale transactions are completed, the company said. “We are closing locations that are unproductive or are no longer robust shopping destinations due to changes in the local retail shopping landscape, as well as monetizing locations with highly valued real estate,” Lundgren said, in a press release. “These are never easy decisions, and we are committed to treating associates affected by these closings with respect and transparency.” (source) Sears and K-mart Sears and K-Mart are both part of the same company, Sears Holdings. They’ll be shuttering 150 stores across the country, putting an undisclosed number of people out of work. They’re also selling Craftsman Tools to Black and Decker. Sears CEO Eddie Lampert said in a statement that the company was “taking strong, decisive actions…to stabilize the company and improve our financial flexibility in what remains a challenging retail environment.” The company noted that while the 150 stores collectively reported sales of $1.2 billion over the past 12 months, they also lost about $60 million. Sears has to stop the bleeding somehow, because the entire company is losing money. “The decision to close stores is a difficult but necessary step as we take actions to strengthen the company’s operations and fund its transformation,” Lampert said. “Many of these stores have struggled with their financial performance for years and we have kept them open to maintain local jobs and in the hopes that they would turn around,” he added. Here’s a list of Sears and K-Mart stores that will be closing. Kohl’s Kohl’s hasn’t announced any store closures, but they’ve dramatically cut their projections for the year ahead. First, it was Kohl’s, which announced it was slashing its full-year forecast, and now sees FY2017 adjusted EPS of $3.60-$3.65, down from $3.80-$4.00 less than two months ago, in the day after the election (ironically). It wasn’t just the future: the company revealed that comp sales were also down 2.1% y/y in fiscal months November and December combined. As Kohl’s CEO Kevin Mansell said, “sales were volatile throughout the holiday season. Strong sales on Black Friday and during the week before Christmas were offset by softness in early November and December.”  (source) CVS The popular pharmacy chain will be closing the doors in 70 locations and will be taking new measures for “efficiency” that are sure to please remaining employees. (Because what pharmacist doesn’t dream of doing data entry?) Speaking at its analyst day event Thursday, CVS Health executives outlined their long-term strategy for growth, which includes closing 70 stores in the coming months. The drugstore retailer’s overall cost-cutting plans aim for $3 billion in savings from 2017 to 2021. In addition to store closures, CVS Health CFO Dave Denton said the company is finding efficiencies in corporate shared services that promise to drive down labor costs by 15% to 20%. For retail, that might include instructing overnight pharmacists to provide data entry during the slow hours, he said. (source) Aeropostale, American Eagle, Chicos, Finish Line, Men’s Wearhouse, and The Children’s Place Many smaller stores are shutting down as well. Mall stores like Aeropostale, which filed for bankruptcy in May, American Eagle, Chicos, Finish Line, Men’s Wearhouse, and The Children’s Place are also in the midst of multi-year plans to close stores. Many more announcements like these are expected in the coming months… …In addition to closing stores, retailers are also looking to shrink their existing locations. “As leases come up, you’re going to see a gradual rotation into smaller-footprint stores,” Hottovy said.  (source) Obviously, this affects the malls, too. When major stores begin to close, it starts a chain of events. As stores continue to close, many shopping malls will be forced to shut down as well. When an anchor store like Sears or Macy’s closes, it often triggers a “downward spiral in performance” for shopping malls, Morningstar analysts wrote in the report from October. The malls don’t only lose the income and shopper traffic from that store’s business. The closure often triggers “co-tenancy clauses” that allow the remaining mall tenants to exercise their right to terminate their leases or renegotiate the terms, typically with a period of lower rents, until another retailer moves into the vacant anchor space. To reduce losses, malls must quickly find a replacement tenant for the massive retail space that the anchor store occupied, which is nearly impossible  — especially in malls that are already financially strapped — when every major department store is reducing its retail footprint. (source) Some businesses that leave when a mall begins to decline don’t reopen, leaving even more people without jobs. How can you protect yourself in this economy? When businesses begin closing en masse and thousands become unemployed, it has a domino effect. Nearly everyone will notice the pinch in some way or another. There are a few things you can do to provide some stability. Get out of debt. Here’s a way to pay it off as quickly as possible. If you find yourself without a job, here are the first steps you should take to survive the aftermath. Reduce your fixed expenses. Build an emergency fund. Get prepped.

One of the main thrift shops in town brought in a bit over a million a few yrs. back. Real thankful for other options other than retail. Still, this is an indication of the state of the poor economy, and the unemployment #’s rising. Reply # 1 NWO Hatr says: January 6, 2017 at 2:14 pm Soon there will be nothing left but Wally World.

Detective Sgt. Brad Holmes said Stephanie L. Langford, 30, 1412 E. 26th St., Sheffield, is charged with third-degree theft of property, fourth-degree theft of property, and two counts of fraudulent use of a credit card. Reports indicate Langford, who was a former employee of Burger King, located inside Walmart on Hough Road, Florence, is accused of taking a patron’s credit card and then using it to make purchases in Walmart. “Someone left their wallet (at Burger King), Langford found it, took a credit card and then went into Walmart and made purchases with the stolen credit card,” said detective Zac Maxwell, who is working the case. He said Langford was taken into custody and then charged. She has been released from the Lauderdale County Jail on bail of $4,500. tom.smith@timesdaily.com or 256-740-5757. Twitter @TD_TomSmith.

The company said it will operate online only after the Jan. 8 closures. The Limited closed its store at Hamilton Place Mall in Chattanooga on Dec. 22. A spokesman said the New Albany, Ohio-based chain operated about 250 retail stores in 2016 and that about 4,000 jobs, including seasonal and temporary ones, would be lost. The announcement came on the heels of Macy's and Sears announcing store closures and job cuts earlier this week. Aldi hiring fair set for Saturday Known for offering wages and benefits that are higher than the national average for the retail industry, Aldi will host a hiring event for its Chattanooga stores from 8 am. to 2 p.m. next Saturday, Jan. 14, at Hilton Garden Inn, 2343 Shallowford Village Drive. Opportunities within Aldi include store associate, shift manager and manager trainee positions. Aldi said it pays $11.50 per hour for store associates and $16 per hour for store managers, Store managers have a chance to earn up to $85,000 a year. Applicants must be 18 years or older, have at a high school degree and be available to work anytime between 6 a.m. and 11 p.m., Monday-Sunday. Retail experience preferred. Indian Point plant to close in 4 years The aging Indian Point nuclear power plant just north of New York City will close within four years under a deal with Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has long argued it should be shuttered to protect the millions of people living nearby. Under the arrangement plant owner Entergy Corp. will shut both reactors at the Westchester County facility by April 2021. A person familiar with the agreement, but not authorized to speak publicly, confirmed the agreement on the condition of anonymity to The Associated Press on Friday. It remains to be seen how the state would make up for the loss of electrical generation once the plant, which supplies a quarter of the power used in New York City and Westchester County, closes. The facility's reactor units began commercial operation in 1974 and 1976. More than 17 million people live within 50 miles of the facility, which sits alongside the lower Hudson River about 30 miles north of New York City, the nation's biggest city. Cuomo, a Democrat, has long argued that operating a nuclear plant so close to a major population center poses a potential safety hazard. Fiat Chrysler recalls 100,000 trucks, SUVs Fiat Chrysler is recalling more than 100,000 older trucks and SUVs worldwide to replace potentially dangerous Takata air bag inflators. The recall includes mainly passenger, but some driver, air bags in certain 2009 Chrysler Aspen and Dodge Durango SUVs, some 2010 Ram 3500 chassis cabs, and certain 2005-2009 Ram 2500 pickups. Takata uses the chemical ammonium nitrate to cause a small explosion designed to inflate the air bags in a crash. But Takata inflators can explode with too much force when exposed to prolonged heat and humidity and hurl shrapnel into vehicles. As many as 16 people have been killed worldwide and about 180 have been injured. Fiat Chrysler said it knows of no injuries involving this group of recalled vehicles. Dealers will replace the inflators with parts made by another company. Fiat Chrysler said the parts are now available. Owners will get letters starting Jan. 12. iPhone sales drop cuts pay for Apple CEO Tim Cook Apple penalized CEO Tim Cook for the iPhone maker's first sales slump in 15 years with a 15 percent pay cut. Cook still made out well with a compensation package valued at $8.7 million for Apple's fiscal year that ended last September. But the amount was down from nearly $10.3 million in the prior year. The Cupertino, Calif., company cited in regulatory documents filed Friday downturns in Apple's revenue and operating profit as the main reason for reducing the pay of Cook and other top executives. Apple's revenue dropped 8 percent to $216 billion while its operating profit declined 16 percent to $60 billion, largely because it sold fewer iPhones for the first time since the device came out in 2007. The company expected sales to rebound during the holiday season. Wal-Mart names Furner as Sam's Club next CEO Wal-Mart says it named John Furner as CEO of its Sam's Club stores to replace Rosalind Brewer, who is retiring next month. Furner, who is 42, will head the membership-only warehouse chain next month. Furner has been Sam's Club's chief merchandising officer since October 2015. Wal-Mart said he first joined the company as an hourly store associate in 1993. Brewer will leave her position Feb. 1. The 54-year-old has been CEO of Sam's Club for five years and has had a variety of executive roles since joining the company about 11 years ago. Starbucks stops selling alcohol at 400 stores Starbucks will stop selling beer and wine at hundreds of U.S. stores next week as it ends its "evenings" program. The coffee chain said the "Starbucks Evenings" program in 439 company-owned stores in the U.S. will end Jan. 10. It said the programs may continue in some of the nine licensed stores where it is offered, or overseas. The program, first tested in 2010, was later expanded as a way to drive sales beyond the morning rush. Trade deficit climbs to $45.2 billion The U.S. trade deficit in November rose to the highest level in nine months as imports of oil and other foreign goods increased, while American exports fell for a second month. The trade deficit jumped 6.8 percent to $45.2 billion, the largest imbalance since February, the Commerce Department reported Friday. Exports edged down 0.2 percent to $122.4 billion, reflecting lower overseas sales of American-made airplanes, autos and farm products. Imports rose 1.1 percent to $231.1 billion, led by a 7.6 percent jump in oil. Factory orders drop but investment rises Orders to U.S. factories fell for the first time in five months in November, but much of the weakness reflected a swing in the volatile category of commercial aircraft. A key category that tracks business investment spending posted an increase. Factory orders dropped 2.4 percent after a 2.8 percent rise in October, the Commerce Department reported Friday. It was the first decline since June, but the weakness was led by a 73.8 percent plunge in demand for commercial aircraft following a 94.5 percent surge in October.

Jan 6, 2017 Chetumal in Protests Over Fuel Hike; How Will it Affect Belize? The New Year has been greeted with protests in Mexico against a government price deregulation that sent the price of fuel there up by as much as twenty percent over the weekend. The Mexican government said the deregulation had long been planned, but unfortunately coincided with rising world oil prices. While prices are still relatively cheaper than in Belize, Mexican nationals are up in arms that the price hike affects their standard of living. There are also effects for Belize, as bus companies that have taken advantage of the cheaper fuel prices over the border may now think twice. But the greatest concern at the moment is whether Mexico is safe for travellers. By the thousands Belizeans cross the northern border looking for goods and services at better prices. In neighbouring, Chetumal popular stores such as Walmart, Chedraui and Aurera Bodega have been looted. Police are at this time preparing for further violence tonight as nationals stack up supplies to keep out of harm’s way. Aaron Humes and Jorge Tabora have been following the story and have this report.   Aaron Humes, Reporting On Thursday night coming into Friday, Chetumal, capital of the neighboring state of Quintana Roo, according to the website sipse.com, was wracked by looting of stores and gas stations by protesting citizens. Elsewhere there was blocking of roads as Mexicans protested the sudden arrival of a de-regulated fuel industry, promised by their president, Enrique Pena Nieto, two years ago. The deregulation is aimed at ending subsidies that the government says largely benefit wealthier Mexicans and at attracting interest in private participation in the newly opened fuel market. But protesters, who say their standard of living will be greatly changed, are planning a second night on the streets, according to Belizean living in Mexico, Jorge Tabora.   Francisco Sanchez Francisco Sanchez, Mexican National “The situation is critical not only for the workers but also for the store owners. This is vandalism. This is not what we expected. It’s no longer fighting against the government.  It’s a festive day and it’s sad that we cannot do what we usually do each year with the children. We need to be more careful when we go out since it’s my understanding that worse things will happen starting tomorrow Saturday.”   It is well-known that local bus drivers, especially in the North, have been buying their fuel in Mexico instead of Belize because of higher taxes here. That may continue, as according to the Embassy there are no restrictions on doing so and prices for premium fuel remain at least two dollars cheaper than Belize’s prices. But could there be potential impacts for the sole Mexican operator in Belize, ADO? This afternoon, their local agent told us that one of the buses returning to Belize was stopped at the Northern Border and at last report was expected to reach late, and he is awaiting details as to the schedule for the coming days. However, he said that he did not expect ticket prices to go up due to higher fuel costs. Tabora shares the view from other Mexican residents.   Francisco Sanchez “What has happened is that the price of gasoline has gone up. This is why all these problems are taking place. It’s not peaceful right now. There is too much vandalism. This is what has us very concerned right now.”   While Ambassador of Mexico to Belize Carlos Quesnel Melendez is back in his native country attending a diplomatic conference, information from the embassy here is that according to latest reports, the tension is cooled down and the protests have been contained, so that it is now safe to travel to Mexico. But the usual precautions apply, including keeping careful watch on one’s surroundings. Aaron Humes reporting for News Five.   With regard to the fuel price situation and a Mexico and Belize comparison, according to the Ministry of Finance, almost four of every ten dollars paid at the pumps goes to taxes for the Government, a rise of ten percent from the previous July. At the start of 2016, Prime Minister Dean Barrow announced a rise in import duties on fuel to combat a fifty-million-dollar revenue shortfall particularly and ironically coming from ever-reducing earnings from locally produced crude oil. It resulted in wild shifting of prices between January and July as the economy adjusted. And in an update to this story, at news time, ADO Belize City agent Fakhrul Amin informed that the second ADO bus was released by border authorities and arrived at five-thirty in the evening, and that tonight’s schedule from Belize City to the northern border, proceeding on to Merida and Cancun, is per normal with two buses. Again, there are no expected price increases for tickets. Be Sociable, Share! Tweet Viewers please note: This Internet newscast is a verbatim transcript of our evening television newscast.

(WKRN) – Two senior care facilities in Franklin became the target of a brazen thief. According to Franklin police, the suspect disguised herself as an employee on Jan. 2 and knocked on several residents’ door. If they answered, the woman talked her way into the room and then stole from them. She spent a total of 40 minutes in one of the facilities. During that time, she reportedly took cash, credit cards, and prescription drugs from four people. One victim’s credit card was used to buy a flat screen television at the Nolensville Road Walmart shortly after the suspect left. Another victim even woke up to find the suspect standing next to her bed. Anyone with information about the crime is urged to contact Crime Stoppers at 615-794-4000.

Jade McDowell East Oregonian Published on January 6, 2017 7:48PM Last changed on January 6, 2017 9:39PM A final replat for a planned Ranch & Home store is on the agenda for Hermiston’s city council on Monday night. George Dress, owner of Tri-Cities retailer Ranch & Home, plans to build a Hermiston location on an 18 acre piece of property on South Highway 395 near the Wal-Mart Distribution Center. The property is currently made up of three separate lots; the replat would reconfigure the lines between those lots. The agenda also includes an item to “consider authorizing the city manager to sign the development agreement with George Dress for development of a Ranch & Home store.” On Monday the council will consider a recommendation from city manager Byron Smith to petition the county to rename East Airport Road. The Eastern Oregon Trade and Event Center is located on the road, and Smith said in a memo to the council that since the event center opened many delivery drivers and visitors have ended up lost on the neighboring Airport Way. Renaming East Airport Road to something less similar could alleviate some of the confusion, Smith said. He did not make a recommendation for what the new name might be. Mayor David Drotzmann, municipal judge Thomas Creasing and at-large city councilors Manuel Gutierrez, Doug Primmer, John Kirwan and Rod Hardin will be sworn in on Monday night and the council will be asked to elect a new council president for the year. Before the regular 7 p.m. meeting, the council will hold a work session at 6 p.m. with city staff on the subject of downtown parking. The meeting will be at city hall, 180 NE 2nd Street. The full agenda can be found online at hermiston.or.us/citycouncil-meetings. ——— Contact Jade McDowell at jmcdowell@eastoregonian.com or 541-564-4536.

Sections Deseret NewsUtah Utah Homes expected to replace Granite High after 7-year saga, but officials have mixed feelings By Ben LockhartDeseret News@benlockhart89 Published: Jan. 5, 2017 10:20 p.m. Updated: Jan. 6, 2017 10:08 p.m. 11 Comments SOUTH SALT LAKE — For 102 years, Granite High School was the picture of constancy for South Salt Lake students. But since the school closed its doors in 2009, citing declining enrollment and prohibitive costs associated with safety upgrades, the future of the vacant property has been anything but certain. City officials initially talked of plans to build a large arts and recreation center there, but the proposed $25 million bond for that project failed by just five votes in 2011. In 2012, Woodbury Corp. and Redman Movies and Stories announced their intentions to coordinate on an ambitious TV and film studio on the property that promised to bring along with it about 1,000 jobs and a $40 million investment. That idea fizzled when the businesses announced they no longer had enough money for the project. Then in early 2016, South Salt Lake Mayor Cheri Wood vetoed the City Council's approval of a Garbett Homes plan to put a Wal-Mart or potentially another grocery store on the property. After seven years without a resolution, the new fate of much of the unused property appears as assured as ever after the South Salt Lake Planning Commission unanimously approved Thursday a proposal from Garbett Homes to build single-family homes there. "We really don’t have any grounds to delay this any further," planning commissioner Rachael Lauritzen said, conceding she gave her vote of approval "reluctantly" because it would mean not preserving the area. About 16 of the 27 acres that housed Granite High will contain new homes. Pending mostly routine approvals and finalizations by city staff, about 76 homes are expected be built there. "We think this will be an awesome subdivision for the city of South Salt Lake. It will attract families," Jacob Ballstaedt, Garbett Homes spokesman, told the planning commission. "This will be a community where they’ll want to stay and raise their family." Garbett Homes plans to purchase and develop the remaining 11 acres, but left that northern part of the property out of the specific proposal discussed Thursday. Ballstaedt said the business wants to move quickly with its plans on the approved portion. Residents angry Thursday's vote followed a contentious public hearing in which several residents expressed their opposition to the Garbett Homes development. Three of the old high school's four main buildings will be demolished as a direct result of the pending purchase, a sore spot for many residents who spoke. Some residents criticized Garbett Homes for only submitting details for one portion of the property, saying the company was purposefully leaving the planning commission with limited information to work with. "Without the totality of that plan  I would urge you to vote against it until there’s a total plan for the whole lot, because we don’t want to end up with another vacant lot for years," resident Kevin Miller told the commission. Ballstaedt said the company is still working on a proposal for those acres and is open to various retail or mixed retail and residential options. He insisted that getting the property development approved in two parts is not an end-around because the city would have to approve a zoning change for the northern parcel in order for commercial developments to be put in place. "Really what it comes down to is trying to determine what the city wants" in that area, Ballstaedt told the Deseret News. School district satisfied Granite School District thought highly of South Salt Lake's plans to purchase the property for its own purposes in 2011, said district spokesman Ben Horsley. But since those plans never materialized, he said, they're pleased to make a sale to Garbett Homes. "While that would have been in our opinion the best option, moving forward it is no longer feasible and this is the next best option," Horsley said. The sale of the southern portion of the property is expected to be finalized by Jan. 23. The minimally maintained property has become a magnet for crime, drawing more than 200 calls to Granite School District police alone over the past year because of trespassing and other issues, Horsley said. "We continue to have squatters, copper theft, drug deals and even young people entering the property to explore and do all manner of vandalism," he said. "It is an attractive nuisance." Last ditch efforts A permanent resolution appears to be right around the corner for the old Granite High, but one organization hopes to make a last-minute bid for the property and keep the buildings standing. Merili Carter, a former fourth-generation Granite High student and project manager for the Utah Arts Alliance, said her organization has been in contact with Garbett Homes and made a preliminary $11.5 million offer for the property in December. Carter hopes the developer will turn around and sell their newly purchased property to the Utah Arts Alliance, which she said wants to preserve the existing buildings and transform them into a community arts and theater campus and one or two small shops. The organization would buy the property using grants and donations, she said. 11 comments on this story Carter said it would be "a shame ... to lose the buildings and lose the open space." Ballstaedt confirmed the Utah Arts Alliance has been in touch with Garbett Homes, but described any sale to the organization as a longshot. He said that's especially true as Garbett Homes ramps up more and more of its own financial resources behind plans to build single family homes on the property. While some residents may want to see the seven-year saga end with their old high school standing, Ballsteadt said it is doubtful that the Utah Arts Alliance's last ditch effort to buy the property will be successful. "The biggest challenge is ... they haven't demonstrated the ability to perform and actually buy the property," Ballstaedt told the Deseret News. 11 Comments Like that? Read this.

Calling from a high-rise building in a suburb of Mumbai, they told her, in tones that were alternately earnest and melodramatic, that they wanted to share the details of a sprawling criminal operation targeting Americans. Ms Broder, who was no stranger to whistle-blowers, pressed the young men for details. “He said his name was Adam,” she said, referring to one of the pair. “I said: ‘Your name is not Adam. What does your grandmother call you?’ He said, ‘Babu.’” This is a foreign media report about how Indian call centre talent was used to swindle Americans and the subsequent actions by the authorities.  Babu was Jayesh Dubey, a skinny 19-year-old with hair gelled into vertical bristles, a little like a chimney brush. He told her that he was working in a seven-story building and that everyone there was engaged in the same activity: impersonating Internal Revenue Service officials and threatening Americans, demanding immediate payment to cover back taxes. If they reached a person who was sufficiently terrified or gullible — this was known in the business as a “sale” — they would instruct that person to buy thousands of dollars’ worth of iTunes cards to avoid prosecution, they said; the most rattled among them complied. The victim would then send the codes from the iTunes cards to the swindlers, giving them access to the money on the card. As it happened, the United States government had been tracking this India-based scheme since 2013, a period during which Americans, many of them recent immigrants, have lost $100 million to it. Though India had no reputation as a large-scale exporter of fraud in the past, it is now seen as a major centre for fraud, said Suhel Daud, an FBI agent who serves as assistant legal attaché at the embassy in New Delhi. Several trends have converged to make this happen, he said: a demographic bulge of computer-savvy, young, English-speaking job seekers; a vast call-centre culture; super-efficient technology; and what can only be described as ingenuity. “They have figured all of this out,” Daud said. “Put all of these together, with the Indian demographics in the US, and it’s a natural segue. Whatever money you’re making, you can easily make 10 times as much.” Pawan Poojary and Jayesh Dubey, best friends and college drop outs, were impressed with the Phoenix 007 call centre in Thane, a suburb north east of Mumbai. The interviewer carried an iPhone; there were racing sport bikes parked outside, and, as Poojary put it, “girls roaming here and there.” The monthly salary was average for call centres, 16,000 rupees (about $230), they said, but the bonuses were double or triple that, based on sales. The two friends had been playing a video game for up to eight hours a day, pausing occasionally to eat. They wanted in. “At that time, in my mind is that I want money,” Poojary, 18, said. “That’s it. I want money. That’s why.” They said they showed up for training in a room of young Indians like themselves, the first in their family to be educated in English. They were a slice of aspirational India: Poojary’s father, who owned two welding shops, was adamant that his son would rise to a higher place in society, an office job. Poojary was afraid to tell him he had dropped out of college. The trainer assigned them names, Paul Edward and Adam Williams, and handed out a six-page script that started out, “My name is Shawn Anderson, with the department of legal affairs with the United States Treasury Department,” the teenagers said. “We read the script, and I asked, ‘Is this a scam?’” Poojary said. “He said, ‘Yes.’” “At that time I am money-minded. I thought, ‘OK, I can do this,’” he said. Poojary was excited and nervous about speaking to an American for the first time, and he was alarmed by the resulting bursts of profanity. Dubey said he tried to commit the entire experience to memory, in case he and Poojary someday decided to start a business of their own. “I just wanted to become a great scammer,” Dubey said. “Everyone was scamming around me. I thought, ‘I will also become a great scammer.’” The key to the whole thing, Dubey decided, was a psychological fact: Americans fear their state.  “I think they actually are really afraid of their government,” he said. “In India, people are not afraid of police. If anyone wants to come and arrest, they say, ‘Come and arrest.’ It is easy to get out of anything. But in America they are afraid. We just need to tell them, ‘You are messing with the federal government,’ and that is all.” Inaben Desai, of Sugar Land, Tex., came home from grocery shopping, and her mother handed her the phone, eyes wide with alarm. Someone was on the line from the government, her mother said. They had called three or four times while she was out. Ms. Desai, 56, worked as a cashier at Walmart. When she picked up the phone, a gruff-voiced man told her that she had failed to pay fees when she got her United States citizenship, in 1995, and that unless she did so she would be deported back to India, she said. When Ms. Desai said she needed to call her husband, a woman got on the phone, speaking sympathetically, in her native Gujarati. “She said, ‘If you involve your husband, there’s going to be more problems,’” Ms. Desai said. “‘Your husband is going to get in trouble, too. Don’t involve your husband.’” Ms. Desai had begun to cry. Still on the line with the woman, she took all the cash she had on hand and drove to a nearby grocery store, where she bought $1,386 in prepaid debit cards. Then the woman instructed her to go to her bank, transfer close to $9,000 to the account of someone named Jennifer, in California, and then fax confirmation and confidential details about her account. “The bank lady tried to stop me, and she said, ‘This is your personal information,’” Ms. Desai said. “But I’m scared, and I faxed it to them because I’m scared of what would happen to my family.” The swindlers, who now had access to her bank balance, called back to demand another sum close to $9,000. Ms. Desai had to drive to another bank branch to make the transaction. The total amount she transferred, $17,786, was nearly all her savings. Mr. Poojary was not the person who called Ms. Desai, whose case dates to 2014. But a similar conversation prompted him to contact the United States government. He recalled the woman’s name as Regella, and said that when she begged him to give her a little time, Mr. Poojary felt so sorry for her that he went to his supervisor, who told him to push harder. “I just feel guilty at that time,” he said. “We are also Indians. We also don’t have money. They also don’t have money.” A few days later, he called the main switchboard at the I.R.S. and said he wanted to pass on information about a crime. “They are not listening, they are just laughing at me,” he said. Finally, he was transferred to Ms. Broder, the Federal Trade Commission’s counsel for international consumer protection. “He was fairly insistent,” she recalled. “He was determined. The number of times he called me was overwhelming. I would guess that is why he was reaching out to me, because he wanted some form of law enforcement to take it down.” The Phoenix 007 call centre initially occupied a floor of this high-rise on Mira Road in Thane, but it eventually filled the entire building. The risk of expanding a fraud aggressively is that the range of potential informants also expands. Supervisors may humiliate employees in front of their peers; paychecks may arrive late or not at all; ringleaders may spend so freely that they attract tax officials’ gaze. The so-called Mira Road scam, named for the building’s neighborhood, had moved into a single floor of the seven-story high-rise in early 2016. By summer it filled the whole building. “It got big,” said Mr. Daud, the F.B.I. agent. “And when it gets big, you leave bread crumbs.” Nitin Thakare, a senior police inspector at the crime branch in Thane, will not say much about the person who contacted him in September with a tip. But he will describe the raid, in loving, cinematic detail: How at 10 p.m., after the last of the call centre staff had arrived for the night shift, 200 police officers streamed up the main staircase, blocking every exit and detaining all 700 people who worked inside. As morning approached, the street outside filled with the workers’ parents, wives and girlfriends, said Amar Verma, who sells tea on the corner. “There was lots of sobbing,” he said. “There was one mother who came with her car. She was crying alone, the poor thing. She was sitting on the pavement in front of me, crying. Her child had not come home.” Inside, the police cut the phone lines. Under interrogation, the suspects, one after another, insisted that they had been planning to quit just as soon as they collected their next paycheck, Mr. Thakare said. But the money made it hard to walk away, and after a few pay cycles, their qualms had faded. He felt for them. “These are the youth of our nation,” he said. “They were misguided. For the first few days it seems glamorous. Someone is teaching them an accent, people are smoking, there are women. There’s freedom and night life. The youth love that.” The police said that others, like the landlord who had rented the building to the swindlers, wondered why the authorities cared in the first place. “He said, ‘What happened?’” said Parag Manere, a deputy commissioner of police. “‘We are not cheating people in India! We are cheating people in the U.S.! And the U.S. cheats the whole world!’” The officers interviewed and released 630 of the call-centre workers, arresting the 70 highest-ranking employees. What they had stumbled on, it became clear, was a branch of a much larger network, the police said. Five days later, the police organized a second raid, of facilities in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, which they believed to be a nerve centre. The Justice Department had come to the same conclusion: It has since released an indictment tracing 1.8 million calls targeting American residents to five call centres in Ahmedabad that used various schemes to defraud more than 15,000 people out of hundreds of millions of dollars. By the time the police arrived at the Ahmedabad location, though, the syndicate was gone. “The place where we raided, it was a thousand-seat call centre,” Mr. Manere said. “When we got there it was empty. Empty. Nothing. Not a piece of paper. Empty halls.” Mr. Poojary said he happened to be at a job interview when he learned that the call centre in Mira Road had been raided. It was an honest, mundane customer service job, advising the customers of Delta Air Lines on such matters as lost baggage and frequent-flier miles, for a mediocre monthly salary of $150. He was sitting on a waiting room sofa when he picked up The Times of India and read that 700 of his co-workers had been detained the night before. The first person he contacted was Ms. Broder, to tell her that the raid had hit the same operation he had described to her. That night, he and Mr. Dubey, who had left the Mira Road centre after contacting Ms. Broder, celebrated over drinks. “We brought it down,” Mr. Dubey said. “It started out as fun, then it got boring, then we truly understood the good and dirty parts of the job. Then we decided to bring it down.” Whistle-blowers’ motives are often murky, and in their early conversations, Ms. Broder wondered fleetingly whether the two friends were calling on behalf of the scheme’s organizers to determine what American investigators knew. In an interview with The New York Times, the two men acknowledged being fired from the call centre after getting into an altercation with co-workers. Their claim to have brought down the centre is unfounded, according to Indian and American investigators, who said that the raid in Thane was carried out entirely by the local police, without assistance from American officials. The Thane police said their informant was not employed by the swindlers. The raid was international news, and in the weeks that followed, the number of fraudulent I.R.S. calls to Americans dropped 95 percent, according to the Better Business Bureau. But those who believe that the drop is permanent should consider this: In the weeks after Mr. Poojary and Mr. Dubey left the centre, several lucrative job opportunities were presented to them. Each involved a phone scheme targeting Americans, they said. There was the Viagra scam, in which callers offered to sell cut-rate Viagra; there was a low-interest loan scam, in which people were asked to deposit $1,000 as proof of income. There was a tech scam, which warned Americans that their computer had been infected by a virus, and an American Express scam, which involved gathering personal information to break through security barriers on online accounts. “Even if you shut down 400 buildings in India, it will not stop,” said Mr. Dubey, now known by his Delta clients as Jacob Davis. The two friends say they have given up on the notion of getting rich quickly, or of being paid by the United States government for the information they provided. It has been replaced by a new hope — that, perhaps as a result of the public service they have provided, they will be granted visas to the United States, the home of so many of their favorite things: “The Fast and the Furious,” Vin Diesel and Robert Downey Jr. “I’ve spent so much time getting to know it, familiarizing myself with its states, talking to its people,” Dubey said. “I feel a bond.”     0 0 Indian call-centre talent used to swindle American was posted in Islamabad of TheNews International - https://www.thenews.com.pk on January 07, 2017 and was last updated on January 07, 2017.

Enlarge photo. Zack Pistora, Kansas lobbyist for the Sierra Club, expounds on a point in the Sierra Club's 2017 legislative agenda during a gathering Sunday at the First Presbyterian Church in Lawrence. Email Print Facebook Tweet Post a comment By Elvyn Jones — Lawrence Journal-World January 8, 2017 Advertisement A Kansas Legislature desperate for cash could be a good thing for possible revenue-producing sustainable initiatives, a lobbyist says. Zack Pistora, the Sierra Club’s lobbyist for Kansas, shared thoughts about the state’s biggest environmental issues and proposed solutions that would be part of Sierra Club’s 2017 legislative agenda with a gathering of about 40 people Sunday at the First Presbyterian Church, 2415 Clinton Parkway. Pistora, who has been the state’s Sierra Club lobbyist for six years, said lawmakers were telling him not to propose too many bills this year because they would be focused on the state’s large and growing revenue shortfall and crafting a new K-12 school funding formula. Nonetheless, Pistora identified a number of issues from water to agriculture to energy that he said need the state’s attention. He anticipated a friendlier reception to environmental concerns as a result of changes in House and Senate chambers after last year’s elections. The dire straits of the state’s fiscal outlook could be a game-changer for environmental advocates if they framed proposals as revenue generators or potential cost-saving measures, he said. Pistora gave examples of how that could be done through more reliance on Kansas resources. The state continues to produce 60 percent of its energy from Wyoming coal despite the abundance of wind energy potential, he said. Kansas was making strides with 28 percent of the state’s production now coming from renewable energy. Wind energy was growing and advances continue to make solar power production cheaper, Pistora said. Advances in efficiency and cost of battery power storage and the potential to store energy as compressed air underground are big game-changers, he said. A measure the Sierra Club favors to help grow the percentage of renewable power sources is the deregulation of electrical utilities so that consumers could buy their power directly from producers, Pastor said. That would encourage further investment in alternate energy production, create jobs and provide additional sources of state revenue, he said. “What if you could buy your energy from Wal-Mart, produced from solar panels on their roof?” he asked. “Obviously, the electrical utilities don’t like deregulation. We have a regulated monopoly of electrical utilities.” Another legislative measure the Sierra Club favors is state encouragement of low-cost financing for measures that provide energy and water savings, Pistora said. The loans would be backed with the borrowers' homes or properties, he said. Also on the Sierra Club’s 2017 agenda is a call for a fracking bill, Pistora said. There is no longer any doubt that deep water injection wells were behind Kansas leaping from one of five states least at risk for earthquakes to one of the top five, he said. The Sierra Club is calling for uniform, statewide regulations on deep water injections, as well as for fees on using the fracking procedure, Pistora said. It is also asking for a full committee hearing exploring the range of the problems, which would demonstrate the costs from fracking-related earthquakes, he said. “They haven’t heard from the victims,” he said. “They haven’t heard from the insurance companies.” Water is the state’s biggest environmental issue with much of the concerns caused by corn production, which not only creates pollution from the overuse of fertilizer, herbicides and pesticides but that is also the leading cause of the continued depletion of the Ogallala Aquifer, Pistora said. The Sierra Club’s proposals to address the latter problem include a depletion reserve allowance tax, such as that charged for the state’s oil and gas wells, and fees for irrigating, Pistora said. “Twenty percent of farmers are using 80 percent of the state’s water, primarily through irrigation,” he said. “I think irrigators should be a little more responsible.” The state should also encourage less cultivation of corn and more of fruits and vegetables, Pistora said. Kansas produces 4 percent of the $700 million in fruits and vegetables it consumes annually, he said. Increasing in-state production of those foodstuffs would benefit the state financially and environmentally, he said.

The robot can greet shoppers and has the potential to send messages geared to people’s age and gender through facial recognition. (SoftBank Robotics America via AP) Published January 08. 2017 4:34PM | Updated January 08. 2017 4:46PM ANNE D’INNOCENZIO, Associated Press Tomorrow’s retail stores want to take a page from their online rivals by embracing advanced technology — everything from helpful robots to interactive mirrors to shelves embedded with sensors. The goal: Use these real-world store features to lure shoppers back from the internet, and maybe even nudge them to spend more in the process. Amazon’s new experimental grocery store in Seattle, opening in early 2017, will let shoppers buy goods without needing to stop at a checkout line. Sensors track items as shoppers put them into baskets or return them to the shelf. The shopper’s Amazon account gets automatically charged. “Amazon, for good or bad, has been setting the path,” said Robert Hetu, research director at Gartner Research. “Each retailer is going to have to respond in some way. But it’s not one-size-fits-all.” Kroger, Neiman Marcus and Lowe’s are among the companies already experimenting with futuristic retail stores. Robots, for instance, could help guide shoppers to the right aisle, while augmented reality apps could help you see how a particular shade of paint will look in the living room — or how you might look in a pair of jeans. Many of these technologies were unveiled or demonstrated at the recent CES gadget show in Las Vegas. Plenty of retailers have learned through trial — and error — that technology can’t get too far ahead of shoppers. It has to be easy to use and beneficial to shoppers in some way, whether it’s to save time or money. If retailers get it right, they might succeed in boosting spending at retail stores at a time when consumers increasingly prefer to shop online. Here are five technologies coming to a store near you. SMART SHELVES Web retailers have plenty of data on their customers. Some of these online technologies can even track shoppers from site to site to lure them back with what’s known as retargeting ads — promos targeted to what that shopper has looked at before, but didn’t actually buy. Smart shelves with sensors promise the same kind of in-depth consumer behavior analytics at retail stores. At a Kroger store in Cold Spring, Ohio, shelves currently show digitized price tags and information about the products. The next step is to tie that to individual shoppers. For example, for a shopper who prefers gluten-free products, the price tags could light up in the aisle where all the gluten-free options are. The company says this will all be done with the customer’s permission. Perch Interactive, a startup that is working with chains like Sunglass Hut and fragrance maker Jo Malone, uses laser and motion sensors to detect when a product is picked up. Perch monitors the interactions and lets retailers know what people pick up but don’t buy. It also offers recommendations: When a shopper picks up a Jo Malone product, an interactive display pops up to show a complementary fragrance. ROBOTS Amazon and other retailers have long used robots in warehouses to help package and ship orders. But what about interacting with shoppers? Home improvement retailer Lowe’s is testing robots in one of its San Jose, California, stores, and plans to roll them out to 10 more stores in the state this year. Besides scanning shelves for inventory, the robots can guide customers to specific products in both English and Spanish. Shoppers also will start seeing robots that interact with them more deeply. Japanese joint venture SoftBank Robotics is testing a 4-foot humanoid robot called Pepper at two Westfield Malls in California. They greet shoppers and can do a little dance, but have the potential to send messages geared to people’s age and gender through facial recognition. SoftBank Robotics says it’s working with clothing retailers to help suggest outfits to shoppers. INTERACTIVE MIRRORS High-end clothing stores are testing interactive mirrors in dressing areas, a key place where shoppers decide whether to buy or not. Neiman Marcus has installed these outside fitting rooms at 20 stores to offer shoppers a 360-degree view of what an outfit looks like. Shoppers can make side-by-side comparisons without having to try them all on. They can also share video with friends for feedback. Variations include capturing a customer’s session at the beauty counter and emailing a video to help the person recreate the look at home. Rent the Runway, an online retailer that lets people rent high-end clothing, teamed up with Samsung to have digital displays highlight its online inventory for shoppers at a new location in New York. A mirror in the store is planned to recommend items that go with what the customer is wearing. VIRTUAL AND AUGMENTED REALITY Home improvement retailers have been embracing virtual reality and augmented reality to help shoppers figure out ways to decorate homes or apartments. With such technologies, shoppers wear a headset to picture how something might look in 3-D, in some cases overlaid on top of their real kitchen or living room. Home Depot’s augmented reality app lets customers upload a picture of the room on their phone and thumb through thousands of paint and stain colors until they arrive at one that’s right. These tools should become more pervasive. At CES on Wednesday, the clothing chain Gap announced an upcoming smartphone app that will let customers try on clothes without stepping foot in a dressing room. SELF-CHECKOUT Stores have been pushing self-service kiosks for years to lower labor costs and speed up checkout lines. It hasn’t always been smooth, though. Two years ago, Wal-Mart offered a Scan & Go app for shoppers to scan items as they grabbed them from the shelves. At the checkout counter, the customer merely had to scan a code to complete the transaction. But Wal-Mart scrapped the project after customers found the app difficult to use. Despite Wal-Mart’s hiccups, plenty of stores believe they can avoid the pitfalls. Andy Wong, partner at Accenture’s Kurt Salmon Digital, said Wal-Mart had a tougher time because its customers are diverse and less techy overall. By contrast, Amazon is trying out its store in Seattle, a tech center, and has a customer base already comfortable with digital shopping. Wong also said Amazon is smart to focus just on groceries, and he expects other retailers to follow Amazon’s lead and also focus on certain products. Shortly after Amazon announced its checkout-less store, Panasonic Corp. unveiled an unstaffed bagging system at a Lawson convenience store in Japan. Shoppers place a “smart” basket with their items on a machine at checkout. The system calculates the bill and automatically bags the items. Shoppers now have to scan items they put into the basket, though wireless tags coming in February will eliminate that step. Shoppers still have to manually pay using cash or card. As retailers consider automated self-checkout and other technologies, they have to look beyond the tech wizardry. “It all has to go back to the consumer,” Gartner’s Hetu said. “For each environment, you have to assess what the consumer will interpret as value.” AP Business Writer Yuri Kageyama in Tokyo contributed to this report.

But as Laura Frykberg reports, 'dieselgate' has made Volkswagen the seventh most hated, according to new research by NGO experts Sigwatch. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript 2015 was a tough year for Volkswagen. Its emissions scandal drove down sales and forced its CEO to quit. Now it's in the headlights again for all the wrong reasons. It's been voted the seventh most criticised corporation by NGO's in a new survey by Sigwatch. Top of the list is agrochemical conglomerate, Monsanto and oil giant, Shell. The survey's compiler is Robert Blood. (SOUNDBITE) (English) SIGWATCH, FOUNDER AND REPORT COMPILER, ROBERT BLOOD, SAYING: "It's because they are Aunt Sallies for NGO's, they represent an industry that they dislike intensely. That is why Monsanto is there, Shell gets there because, one it is still in a very controversial industry, the oil industry. " The study isn't all negative though. There's been praise for some big businesses. GRAPHIC Food firm Nestle topped that list for the second time. Campaigners welcoming its commitment to sustainability. Also on the list is British retailer Marks and Spencer and U.S. giant Walmart. GRAPHIC (SOUNDBITE) (English) SIGWATCH, FOUNDER AND REPORT COMPILER, ROBERT BLOOD, SAYING: " I think we tend to run down Walmart, we have sort of got an out of date view of how they operator. Basically retailers have the advantage, they move very quickly, they can look at issues like sustainability, supply chain problems and really turn on a sixpence in a way that oil or mining companies can't." Blood says surprisingly banks too did well last year. Seven financial institutions made the top 20. A bit of respite for an industry increasingly under scrutiny.

David Gardner (TMFSpiffyPop) Jan 8, 2017 at 10:32AM Though the holiday season may be officially over, Motley Fool co-founder David Gardner believes these stocking stuffers are still worthwhile purchases for the new year and beyond. In this episode of Rule Breaker Investing, we look at gifts that truly keep on giving: shares of high-quality companies that even your kids will appreciate. So while it may be too late to put these under the tree (which now sits on the curb awaiting disposal), they do make for wonderful new year's resolutions. A transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Dec. 7, 2016. David Gardner: Welcome back to Rule Breaker Investing. Happy December. Arguably one of the top months of every year -- arguably. For me I think it is. And I came across this Jason Moser tweet. Jason Moser, of course, who you know from podcast fame in The Motley Fool and an analyst here at The Motley Fool. And I retweeted this because I loved it. It was on December 3 and Jason went with: Holiday gift idea for your kids: 1. Open custodial online brokerage account. 2. Buy stock. 3. Repeat Step 2 for all future holidays. Love it. He was reacting to a MarketWatch fact. We'll assume this is not fake news. The median working-age American couple only has $5,000 saved for retirement. Presumably you can Google that and look it up on MarketWatch, which is certainly disconcerting now. The good news is that's working age. So often, if you are like a lot of people, you don't really get to start saving in earnest until you get past some tuition and maybe your own student debt, so a lot of us start small. But the good news is if you're a Foolish investor -- if you're patient -- if you're doing a lot of the things I try to coach you to do every week in this podcast [and] across all our Motley Fool podcasts (growing love for stocks, helping the world invest better), I think you can get up way, way above $5,000. But that's a good place to start. And if that's where the average -- well, the median working-age American couple is -- darn it, we'll start from there and go forward. The good news is you have something saved, because a lot of people don't. But why did Jason's tweet jump out at me? Well, because it's something that I've thought a lot about in the past and talked some about. Probably here on our podcast. Definitely at Fool.com. The Motley Fool's been behind this for a long time. And it's the idea that yeah, giving a gift of stock is a great idea. So my theme this week [is] we're going to make some stock picks. I'm going to make some stock picks this week. Five stocks to put under your tree. And I'll get to those in a little bit, but first I just want to talk a little bit about gift giving. I think most of us, most of the time when we think of gifts, we think of something physical. Something tangible. For us as little kids, we loved to see toys. We were less excited, maybe, by invisible things or semi-visible things like, let's say, a check. A check for $25. Often Mom or Dad [would] say, "Oh, it's so great that Gramps gave you $25. We're going to deposit that for you in your account." And if you're seven years old, that doesn't (at least it didn't to me) sound that exciting. We like tangible things. It doesn't necessarily change that much as we become adults. We think in terms of tangible things and that certainly is a worthy gift. One of my favorite tangible things to give every year is board games. I shared with you last week a few that I would recommend if you're looking around for a gift idea this holiday season, but that's category one. However, we had a dad who raised my brother Tom and me to think more about category two, especially as we get a little older. Teenage years. College years. Adult years. And that's experiences. So taking a friend out for lunch. Buying tickets to a play. These kinds of things where years from now you may have already put away the chip dish that you received (the fourth one that you already had), but you'll never forget that time that you spent going to the play with your grandfather. Or taking a surprise trip with your spouse or partner. Experiences. We can give those as gifts. I think they work great because they create memories. So we love category two. But what Jason did is he opened up one of my favorite things -- I'm going with category three -- and that is the gifts that truly keep on giving. And I can't think of a better idea than shares of public companies that you admire. That you want your giftee to enjoy watching grow over the course of time. So [of] these three categories, only one of these categories involves a gift that truly gains in value over time. Now, the holiday season wouldn't be as rich if it didn't have all three categories of gifts, but the first one is obvious to most of us; the second one is a little subtle; the third one is often invisible or not even thought of, and I don't think the world should work that way. So I'm here to suggest that you consider giving a gift of stock. Open up that custodial online brokerage account. You can search our site, Fool.com, to see how to do that. We have discount brokerage partners. You may already have a brokerage account. You can open up a custodial account for a child in your life, and then buy them stock, and put it under the tree, and I've got five ideas for you this week. And my five ideas all conform to a few traits because, after all, if you're going to put these under the tree (I'm aiming this for kids), it needs to have a few things going on. First of all, I think you need to be able to explain to them the company, the stock that you've bought for them. If you haven't already had a little stock market talk with them anyway, you should do that, and I don't care what age they are. The earlier you can start letting kids know that they can become part owners of the companies that make the products and services that they love, the better. So if you've not already had that talk, have that talk before that day underneath the tree so there's some context. But then, for each of the five companies I'm going to present you with, I think they're very explainable to kids, and I think that's important. Also, I think each of these companies has a little bit of magic associated with it. It kind of fits with the anticipation of the morning of December 25, at least in my household. Each of these companies does something that feels special. There's a little bit of Santa running through each of the ticker symbols and the companies behind them that I'm sharing with you this week. I think that's important, as well, for putting stock underneath the tree. So we're not going to have any insurance companies this week. We're not going to have any semiconductor companies this week. Those might be great stocks, and I've talked about them in the year past. By the way, this is the 76th weekly podcast for Rule Breaker Investing, so I've been working with you for more than a year now. We've talked about those kinds of companies -- we will in the future -- but these are stocks we're putting underneath the tree. And the final thing I'll mention is none of these stocks is named "Disney". And that's because I think you should already have given children in your life shares of Disney because, of course, it conforms to everything that I think makes for the classically good stock gift that grows in value over time and helps teach a child how business works, how life works and, indeed, that you can be a part owner of things you love. And often that's one of the best ways to profit. So I still have my elves working on this list of stocks, but I have to do a little housekeeping before we get to it. First of all, let me just mention that if you're new to our podcast, you can subscribe to Rule Breaker Investing on iTunes, or Spotify, or your favorite subscription service for podcasts, and that means we'll pop up every week on your phone. In your life. We'd love it if you'd do that. I would especially appreciate a gift from you this week. I'd love for you to review this podcast. Throw me some stars, as I've been saying in recent weeks. Give us a review. Let us know how we're doing. That would be a wonderful gift (category two) that you could do for us. The better reviews we get, the more people find out about Motley Fool podcasts, the more the world begins to invest. Now, again, before I present this list, let me mention two things about my lists. This is probably the eighth or ninth list that I've done of stock picks on this show. I tend to do it once every couple of months, and two things happen when I do this. One, I like to give a time frame. So the time frame, of course, for this week's picks is going to be five-plus years. After all, we want your kids to grow up with these companies, so this is a five-plus years. And the second thing that I do is I type these into Motley Fool CAPS. So if you go to CAPS.Fool.com, my screen name is TMFSpiffyPop. You can find me, there. I hope you already have in the past. And I will have picked these stocks, so you can see me hold myself accountable using our CAPS platform. You can see whether we beat the market with this list, as badly as we seem to have already beaten the market with a few of the lists we've already reviewed. So it's always fun to check back in over time. That's one thing that I think is so important to do -- score yourself and learn -- so I always do that with my stock picks and these will be no exception. And by the way. I should mention at the top of each person's scorecard on CAPS it shows their most recent picks. You're only going to see one from this week's show that shows up on the top of my list. That's because I already have the other four as active picks. But I will be -- for the one that I don't -- featuring it right at the top of my scorecard with a fresh pick made this week. All right. Stock number one this week. These are going to be alphabetical. This ticker symbol starts with two As. Do you know where I'm headed? I bet you do. Apple. So for each of the stocks I'm going to present this week, I'm going to mention three things you can talk about with your kids as they unwrap and find out what they've just gotten from you under the tree. And I think the first thing you want to do, if and when you give Apple shares to a child, is you want to show them the logo. You might even want to quiz them and say, "Hey, honey. What does this mean?" And I bet, at least if you have any iPhones, iPads, or any Apple gear kicking around your house, your child of any age will probably know pretty quickly. And that's a good lesson right there, because the logo and the brand is a critical item for me when I think about what I want to be invested in for years. Apple has, by many accounts, the number one most-recognized brand in the world, and that, itself, is a short and simple lesson to talk about under the tree: the best-known brand in the world. You can point out, "Hey, honey, you just knew this at the age of six. Well, it's actually the best-known one in the world and I just gave you some shares of that company." Number two. This company focuses (think about this) on making as many people worldwide as comfortable as possible using technology. That's the way -- one way, anyway -- I think about Apple. And just think about that. This is, I believe, the number one most valuable stock company in the world among public companies. At least, as of this podcast, it's tripping the gauge at $612 billion. By the way, for those keeping score at home, that's about $75 billion more than Alphabet, which comes in at number two, at least in the universe that I follow. So just think about that. The company that is the most valuable in the world. How have they done that? In an age of increasing technological sophistication, this company has tried to make it as convenient, as accessible as possible. It just works. A great lesson. And number three. And this one is from my producer, Rick Engdahl, an Engdahl special, and I love this point, Rick. Apple, for so many people, inspires them toward creativity. Certainly so many creative class professionals use and have always used, for decades, Apple gear. But whether it's taking pictures, and cropping pictures, and flipping them around, and coloring them, and sending them to friends, or really shooting a movie, a commercial movie [and] everything in between, Apple truly has harnessed and unleashed, for a few decades, probably more creativity visually than any company in the world. Although maybe the people at LucasArts might argue box office numbers, it's been truly remarkable, and each of those three points is worthy of talking about underneath the tree. All right. Stock number two, staying alphabetical as I mentioned (by ticker symbol, though). This is another "A," and I think Amazon.com would make an outstanding gift for kids over the next 30-plus years. And here's the little talk we're going to have about Amazon. First of all, I think we're going to have a Santa Claus talk. Now, everybody listening to this podcast knows that Santa Claus is real. I think it's worth pointing out, though, that Santa is probably busier than at any point in history. After all, there are now seven-plus billion human beings on the planet. That's way more than have ever been around before. And if you think about the amount of work that Santa has to do on that one special night of every year, you can see that he could use some help. And my sources suggest that he's sometimes outsourcing these days, a little bit, to this particular company, Amazon.com. I certainly have benefited a lot from the deliveries that I have gotten from Amazon supplementing the work that Santa does, and I've enjoyed using Amazon to give some gifts, as well. I think that increasingly Amazon is making a lot of the holiday season possible for many, many people worldwide. So you have an opportunity to talk a little bit about Santa maybe outsourcing, a little bit, to this company. And if you had to ask of all the companies worldwide which one might Santa be partnered with, I think this one would come, at least first, to my mind. Point number two. I think it's worth letting kids know that if you do something really, really well, the world is going to want more from you. So you know the story of Amazon. I do, too. It started off just by selling books online, and this is about 20 years ago. So now, 20 years later, Amazon sells so many different things online. And the reason that Amazon has been able to expand its business to become the largest e-commerce portal in the world is because the company focused on you and me, first. Jeff Bezos, the CEO, his vision was always for Amazon to be "the most customer-centric company in the world." And whether you would agree that he's achieved that or not (and I personally do agree with him), but whether you agree with that or not, they're making an awfully good stab at it and the world has asked more and more of that company. And so I think it's a great lesson for kids: that if you do something really well, people are going to want you to do more. And you have an opportunity if you're an entrepreneur to grow -- or just as a person to grow -- as you do more and more for more people. Amazon is a tremendous 20-year success story demonstration of that point. And then number three for kids [is] I think it's just worth talking a little bit about the name. I always enjoy etymologies of words, anyway; or thinking about names and why are things named that way. And I think it was clear to me, anyway, from early on that Jeff Bezos could have named his site something like Books.com or BooksMusicVideos.com or something like that; but the truth is from day one he called it Amazon. And if you think about that great, big river, and you think about all of the commerce that flows through Amazon today; and you think about his decision not to give it a very obvious dot-com name, but really a name that would stand on its own. A beautiful name that has the letters A to Z, if you've ever looked at the logo (at least the older-school logo had a little arrow pointing from the A to the Z) they've got everything covered. I think you have an opportunity to talk some about names. And maybe this could get into a talk with a child about how you selected his or her name, or one of their middle names, and a little bit of etymology or family history, there. Stock number three, and we're staying with the As. Yes, I did start. I sorted my Supernova universe (the 200-plus companies that I follow) from A to Z. I just started at the top. And I had already found my third one before I even got to the letter B. There might be a little bit of... What would that be, Rick? Alphabet-centrism? Some bias toward the A's and not the Z's present in this week's podcast? Perhaps, so. Number three is Activision Blizzard. Now, depending on who your child is and what age he or she is, maybe there already is some Activision Blizzard underneath the tree this year. For example, Skylanders. Lots of younger kids are into that game, and you might have some gear or the games in the Skylander universe. That's Activision Blizzard. Hearthstone for an older child or maybe like me -- an older adult -- a wonderful game. Call of Duty for teenagers and up. The classic first-person shooter. Or how about for the whole world at large (as Activision Blizzard has now reached 1 billion customers), Candy Crush Saga. That reaches lots and lots of people. So conversation number one is about how you can be buying the company as well as the product that you love. And probably it doesn't take looking too far for a child to see these names and brands and realize who they are and what this company's about. I think conversation number two for Activision Blizzard -- well, it's in the name right there -- how companies combine, because Activision and Blizzard were separate companies. In fact, it was December of 2007 when Activision, with its present CEO, Bobby Kotick, announced that the company and its assets would merge with fellow games developer and publisher of Vivendi Games, the French company. Vivendi owned Blizzard Entertainment at the time. Later this company got spun off and went independent as its own entity, Activision Blizzard. But Activision brought over the Call of Duty series. It brought Guitar Hero. It brought Tony Hawk, if you remember those video games, or Skylanders, as I mentioned. And that merged with Blizzard some of the brands that I love, like Diablo and Hearthstone. StarCraft. Warcraft. And those companies came together to form Activision Blizzard. So I think you have a little bit of a conversation, there, about mergers and things that sometimes work or often don't work (if you think of AOL/Time Warner). Or maybe in your own professional life, you have a viewpoint about whether mergers are good or bad. In this case, I think it's worked out really wonderfully well over the last year, adding King Digital, which is not in the Activision Blizzard name, but has added a lot with Candy Crush Saga. So that's conversation number two on this one. And then conversation number three for Activision Blizzard -- let's talk a little bit about sizing. I like simple numbers. I like simple math. Fifth-grade math. That's how I like to keep my investing. And I've always talked about market cap, a lot, on Rule Breaker Investing. It's a quick way to size up the value of different things in the world. So the market cap -- just a quick reminder -- is nothing more than the share price of the company multiplied by the number of shares of that company. And when you do that math, you end up with the total value of that company. Now I'm not adjusting for enterprise value. I'm not adding in debt or subtracting it. But for the purposes that we're talking about now -- just big, simple numbers -- it's the price tag if you wanted to buy the company. And I often liken it to walking down the aisle at Wal-Mart, let's say, and there are price tags and everything. And you can kind of see the relative sizing and differences in pricing, one product to another. I think that's great to be able to do with the stock market. Ironically, and perhaps sadly, I think a lot of times people do that looking at the share price, itself, and they'll see one stock at $117 a share, and another stock at $17 a share, and they'll think that the one that's $117 is much bigger than the one at $17 and those things have nothing to do with each other. The function of a price per share is simply how many shares exist at that price, and when you multiply them together, you get market cap. So maybe too much math to talk about under the tree, here. Maybe too much excitement about what the next gift is. Maybe this is an opportunity on boxing day, the day after, to discuss this with a child. Here's some market caps real quick. How about the two companies we just covered? Apple -- Apple tips the scales at about $610 billion and Amazon.com about $350 billion. So Apple almost twice the size of Amazon. Activision Blizzard, our third company, is at about $27 billion. In other words, less than one-tenth of Amazon and less than one-twentieth of Apple. I think it's great, not just for kids, but for adults to recognize the relative sizing, because when I ask myself which stock is more likely to go up five or 10 times in value over the next five to 10 years, usually I look at the smaller market caps, just because it's really hard to take a $600 billion market (Apple's), and even see that double. Certainly not overnight, but anytime soon. Now, Apple has a lot built into it. It pays a dividend these days and there's a lot more stability in a massive company like that, and it's a great gift to put under the tree for a child, but it's good to have a sense of the different sizes of these companies. Now, company number four (speaking of sizing), we're going back to massive because let's face it. Stocks that you're putting under the tree are probably going to be well-known companies. Big brands. Big consumer-focused companies. And Facebook, stock number four, ticker symbol (FB), of course, is one of those. And I think the first conversation you want to have about Facebook -- besides the market cap, which I'll mention, which is $331 billion [David said "million" at 00:22:20], so just a little bit smaller than Amazon, these days -- is the frequency of use of a product or service. Now, I personally am not on Facebook. I am @DavidGFool on Twitter. I know many of you are active on Facebook. We have a great Motley Fool Podcast group. We just had our thousandth joiner of the Motley Fool Podcast group on Facebook. I know many, many people use Facebook for a lot of hours, and that's conversation number one. Perhaps you, or your spouse or partner, uses Facebook a lot. Perhaps your child, even if quite young, has precociously noticed that you might be spending too much time on Facebook. I think it's a great opportunity to mention the value of products or services that we are using every day. That might go for what you're stocking in your refrigerator, or what you're tapping into online. Facebook is a tremendous example of this, and even if you're not on it, I bet you can point out Uncle Larry, and make a joke about Uncle Larry who spends too much time on Facebook. We all know people who are using Facebook, and that's an important point for kids. So the frequency of use of a product or service. One of the classic lines from the Gillette CEO of yore was "I love waking up, every day, because I know everyone's beard has grown a little bit more overnight, and they have to use my product," with their razor and blades business model. Kind of a cliché example, but these are the companies, often, that we should be not just using ourselves, but owning shares ourselves, and I think it's a great example of stocks to give to kids. So that's number one. Conversation number two about Facebook is the "how they make money" conversation. I think often it's very evident to kids, if they have a Skylanders video game, how the company makes money. You buy the product, the company takes in the money. Facebook, though, a little subtler. In fact, Facebook had a lot of skeptics on Wall Street that this company could ever really make that much money just as, in one era beforehand, Google. The biggest question about Google, as it prepared to go public, is how are these guys actually going to make money? And so I think the important lesson, here, is that this company makes money with a free product for the most part, and I think most kids can probably get this. Depending on their familiarity with Facebook, or their age, maybe they won't. But, of course, Facebook primarily makes money the same way Google does, through advertising dollars. So we are freely using services like Google and Facebook -- and through the advertising relationships that they have spanning the Earth with advertisers who know a lot about you and me, and therefore they can pitch the right products to you or me -- that's a good lesson for kids to know. And so in contrast to my previous three stocks (our other three stocks under the tree, so far), those companies all clearly sell products. This one doesn't. "So son, daughter, how do you think they make money?" And then number three, and the final conversation about Facebook (I think it's kind of related to the previous point), but not just products cost money. Something else also costs money. Time is money, friend, and that's really good to make sure kids understand, as well. So while, on the face of it, Facebook is completely free (there's an opportunity to moralize a little bit, here, if you like to moralize, sometimes, about social media) the amount of time that you or I [are] spending on Facebook, or in my case playing board games, or whatever it is that you're sinking lots of time into; that time comes at a very subtle and sometimes very great cost. So being more cost conscious, specifically in the area of time. That thing that seems to not be green or gold -- that didn't seem to have hard currency associated with it -- I think it's a really great point to get across not just to kids, but like a lot of things I'm saying this week, to adults, as well. OK. That leaves us with our fifth and final company. A little bit of magic. A little bit of Santa to unwrap underneath the tree. This company certainly fulfills that for me, personally. Perhaps for you, too. Number five is Netflix. Netflix, by the way, has a market cap... I'll pause for a sec. Let you throw out a number as you're driving your car or jogging right now. What do you think Netflix's market cap is? By the way, if you're within 20%, you can score yourself a star. All right, you got it? All right. The answer is $52 billion. So if you were anywhere from $40-60 [billion], you're good. If not, you need to go back to market cap school. OK. So Netflix -- I think conversation number one with kids about Netflix is the way the company started out, which is, "You know, son, daughter. Back before we had streaming..." And by the way, Netflix has such a popular offering for kids shows in streaming today. A lot of kids growing up these days with Netflix. Watching [the] kids Saturday morning shows basically on Netflix, commercial free, when, at least my recollection of my Saturday mornings as a kid is that there were a ton of commercials mixed into all of the cartoons. So the first conversation is how Netflix started, which is that it took, before streaming, back when we rented DVDs or even VHS tapes (back before then), it took late fees out of the equation. So you can point out to your child, who will not even understand the concept, presumably, of having to go down to a store and pick up a VHS tape, and then make sure you return it by Thursday, [or] otherwise you're going to start racking up late fees (which I did consistently as an irresponsible, young adult), they took that out of the equation altogether and that made people happy. And that's a really important point about entrepreneurism (the type that succeeds, anyway, out in the marketplace), which is you're generally going to win when you make people happy. And when you change the game to make people happy -- when you change how people rent videos, as Netflix has done more than once, now, through different evolutions -- there's a lot of value to be created. So that's point number one. Change the game and make people happy. I think conversation number two, for kids about Netflix, is maybe a lesson, a talk about mistakes. Because it wasn't so long ago that Netflix went through a death-defying drop. The year was 2011. The stock had hit a recent high of $45 a share -- this is all in post-split terms, so $45 a share in modern-day parlance -- and it dropped in one year (less than one year) from $45 to $10. And a lot of us will remember that as the time of the Qwikster fiasco, a decision made by Reed Hastings, himself, to split streaming from DVD. To split your queue, if you were keeping one, as I did. My queue always numbers more than 100 things on Netflix. I will die never watching hundreds of things that I had on Netflix. The whole customer experience was disrupted. Consumers didn't like it, the marketplace didn't like it, Wall Street didn't like it, and Netflix stock cratered, based on some bad decisions, $45 a share to $10 a share. Today, you can point out to your son or daughter the stock is more like $120. It's up 12x since those really tough lows. I think there's a great lesson about being willing to take risks, which is what Hastings did back then. About failing, which is going to be what happens, sometimes, when you take risks. But I think the lesson is ... Do you remember this? One of my USA core values -- five core values that I see in our country -- one of them is the word "resilience." You know, the great line ... I used this a lot with my kids growing up. Maybe not under the tree, but "winners are losers who didn't quit." Or the old Vince Lombardi line, "It's not whether you get knocked down. It's whether you got back up." I think that's really an important conversation. Netflix is a great example as your son or daughter opens this up underneath the tree this month. And the final conversation -- I think I've already foreshadowed it -- but I think you can talk about those kids shows. The offering that Netflix has for kids is tremendous. It's a big competitive advantage in this age of everybody trying to have the next Game of Thrones (thinking about very expensive series aimed at adults), and Netflix has a bunch of those. We tend to forget the large number of us who are below the age of 18 and think about what offerings you want to pay ($8-10 a month) in order to bring that into your household advertising free. So I think, for me, it's a reminder for kids (and I'm going to close with this), that finding products and services that you really like is a great way to find a stock that you should buy. My brother Tom and I spoke at the Alexandria, Virginia Chamber of Commerce this morning as I tape here on Tuesday, December 6. It was good to see our local brethren at the AVA Chamber of Commerce. Shout out to any new listeners this week from Alexandria. But we had an opportunity to tell, again, that brief story, that iconic story that we have of how we started investing, which is that our dad would take us into the Safeway in Washington, DC, where we grew up, and he'd say, "Hey, kids, look. Chocolate pudding. We own some of the company that makes that chocolate pudding. Let's go get more chocolate pudding." Made him a great dad. A very popular dad. But the lesson that he was giving us we remember to this day, and I'm sharing it out here, this week, on Rule Breaker Investing and it's that life is like chocolate pudding. There's a lot of great stuff out there and beyond just the pudding, itself, you can be a part owner of the company that makes the chocolate pudding in your life and in your child's life. And that's why I think you should start wrapping up some stocks underneath the tree. All right.

Photo: AFP He might be American and own a major soccer club, Arsenal, but Stanley Kroenke, the new boss of a prestigious Burgundy vineyard, says he knows his wine and would not mess with tradition — and locals say they believe him. The Bonneau du Martray vineyard “shares the same philosophy as ours in California, based on the quality of the land and the wines,” said his manager, Armand de Maigret. “We are winemakers, not a marketing machine.” A point well taken by Louis-Fabrice Latour, head of Burgundy’s wine federation BIVB, who says he is “reassured” by Kroenke’s status as a wine professional who makes some of the world’s most expensive wine. “He will respect the Burgundy tradition,” Latour said. The sporting empire of Kroenke, 69, also includes gridiron team the Los Angeles Rams and basketball’s Denver Nuggets and his fortune was estimated at US$7.7 billion by Forbes magazine last year. De Maigret said Kroenke’s team would “maintain the domain while adding a few Californian tricks and transferring some Burgundy tricks to California.” Kroenke bought an 80 percent share in the Bonneau du Martray vineyard, which has been run by the same family for about 200 years, for an undisclosed sum. De Maigret earlier told the French financial newspaper Les Echos that Kroenke’s first foreign acquisition in the wine-making world was “the product of love at first sight.” The vineyard, near the town of Pernand-Vergelesses, produces two highly regarded grand crus: a white wine, Corton Charlemagne, and a red, Corton. Both are mostly for export. Its vines are spread over 11 hectares on the prestigious Corton hill near Beaune. Kroenke bought the vineyard from four brothers, all in their 60s and none of whose offspring were interested in taking on the business. With no heirs to pass the property on to, they contacted 10 potential buyers around the world. The best offer came from Kroenke, who is married to Wal-Mart heiress Ann Walton Kroenke and also owns vineyards in Napa Valley, California, where he produces the cabernet sauvignon Screaming Eagle. The sum of the transaction is a well-guarded secret. A spokesman for the Le Bault de la Moriniere family would say only that the figure was “very, very high.” Some local winemakers are talking about a price tag of 100 million euros (US$105 million), but when asked about the rumor the spokesman said: “You’re way off” — implying that the sum was even higher. Latour said news of the sale was “an event on the hillside,” adding that only about 1.5 percent of the winegrowing region changes hands — outside of families — each year. A Chinese investor bought the Gevrey-Chambertin chateau and vineyard for 8 million euros in 2012, and two other sales stood out in 2014: LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE snapped up the Clos des Lambrays and the 20 hectare Pommard chateau was bought by Silicon Valley boss Michel Baum. Other US neighbors for Kroenke are to be the Kopf family, who bought the Maison Louis Jadot in 1985. This story has been viewed 2047 times. Comments will be moderated.

The 5 Best Flat Irons for Natural, Coarse, and Kinky... Here's How to Get Karlie Kloss's Glowing Skin with... The 35 Best Celebrity Braids of All Time StyleCaster A Definitive Guide to Safe Nail Polishes Facebook Pinterest Twitter Tumblr 0 byBibi Deitz 81 Shares 1 week ago 33 Start slideshow We hear a lot about “safe” nail polishes these days, but it can be confusing as to what, exactly, those polishes really are. Is it best to go for 3-free? 5-free? 7-free? And what does it all mean? We spoke with three cosmetic chemists to get the lowdown on the whole thing, and then we found 33 nail polishes (in cute colors!) for you to shop, so you never have to worry about putting pretty polish on your nails again. For starters, the “free” designations on nail polishes simply means that these formulas are free of certain harmful chemicals. “What 5-free and 7-free means is that they removed the known carcinogens,” cosmetic industry consultant Joseph J. Cincotta, Ph.D., tells us. Specifically, 3-free formulas eliminate formaldehyde, toluene, and dibutyl phthalate; 5-free formulas are also usually missing formaldehyde resin and camphor; 7-free take away ethyl tosylamide and xylene from the mix; 8-free removes triphenyl phosphate; and 9-free also gets rid of parabens. Credit: Instagram | @ipsy So—let’s say you’re going with a 9-free polish. “Does this make nail polish safe is still the question,” Cincotta says. “Nail polish contains volatile solvents (ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, acetone) that create its characteristic odor.” He adds that the smelly fumes you find in many nail salons are part of the problem. “Just walk into any nail salon, do you want to inhale those solvents all day? I consider any long term exposure to volatile solvents unhealthy.” There is good news: “Once the polish dries on your nails, the film left behind (if the chemicals listed above are not present) is pretty much a nonissue,” he said. But if you’re still worried about it, “the perfect solution would be a water-based acrylic nail polish,” he says. (Don’t worry, we included some in our slideshow.) “However, the performance just isn’t as good to date as the solvent-based formulas,” he adds. Credit: Instagram | @joylakay Others think the whole thing is much ado about nothing. “Questions about the safety of ingredients used in nail polish come up all the time, but according to the best science to date, consumers don’t seem to have much to really worry about,” cosmetic chemist Randy Schueller, cofounder of The Beauty Brains, tells us. This all has a lot to do with the level of exposure to which you’re subjected. “Are these ingredients really dangerous?” asks Schueller. “It depends on the level of exposure. If you polish your nails once in a while in a well-ventilated room, you probably won’t have any problem. If you’re a salon worker who is constantly exposed to fumes in an improperly ventilated workplace, then there is cause for concern.” Credit: Instagram | @paintboxnails And the concern is serious: Schueller cited serious health risks associated with long-term exposure to “some of the main ingredients of concern,” which “include formaldehyde, dibutyl phthalate, toluene, formaldehyde resin, and camphor.” These risks “range from cancer to neurological damage to skin irritation,” he said. Don’t panic, though. According to a study Schueller pointed out that was published last year, “American consumers should not be concerned by new research that is speculative, misleading, and does not use sound science to assess the safety of an ingredient which has a long and well-documented history of safe use.” Credit: Instagram | @ipsy Cosmetic chemist Jim Hammer, the founder of Mix Solutions, says though it’s true that the fumes are dangerous, the chemicals themselves are relatively safe. “The number-one safety concern for consumers using conventional, old-school nail polishes is the volatile solvents,” Hammer tells us. “In these formulas, the resins are dissolved in solvents like toluene, butyl acetate and ethyl acetate, which create a lot of fumes during use.” As long as you have “adequate ventilation” while painting your nails, you should be fine.  “All of the other things are really a secondary concern,” Hammer says. “Plasticizers, like the phthalates, tend to get trapped pretty well within the dried resin coating, so there is very little exposure to the consumer from these.” And though formaldehyde sounds scary, it’s negligible, he adds: “Formaldehyde resins are sometimes used, but the formaldehyde is chemically combined within the polymer, so there is little if any free formaldehyde which the consumer will be exposed to. Other questionable ingredients—camphor, etc.—are also pretty well locked inside the resin.”  Ahead, find our favorite 33 nail polishes—and decide for yourself if 3-free, 5-free, 7-free, 8-free, or 9-free is the way to go. If you want to be super safe, try one of the two water-based formulas we found, and just paint your nails a little more often (these tend to chip faster).

Email Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters. Solar power is now cheaper than coal in some parts of the world. In less than a decade, it's likely to be the lowest-cost option almost everywhere. In 2016, countries from Chile to the United Arab Emirates broke records with deals to generate electricity from sunshine for less than 3 cents a kilowatt hour, half the average global cost of coal power. Now, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Mexico are planning auctions and tenders for this year, aiming to drop prices even further. Taking advantage: companies such as Italy's Enel SpA and Dublin's Mainstream Renewable Power, both of which gained experienced in Europe and now seek new markets abroad as subsidies dry up at home. Since 2009, solar prices are down 62 percent, with every part of the supply chain trimming costs. That's helped cut risk premiums on bank loans and pushed manufacturing capacity to record levels. By 2025, solar may be cheaper than using coal on average globally, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. “These are game-changing numbers, and it's becoming normal in more and more markets,” said Adnan Amin, director general of International Renewable Energy Agency, an Abu Dhabi-based intergovernmental group. “Every time you double capacity, you reduce the price by 20 percent.” Better technology has been key in boosting the industry, from the use of diamond-wire saws that more efficiently cut wafers to better cells that provide more spark from the same amount of sun. It's also driven by economies of scale and manufacturing experience since the solar boom started more than a decade ago, giving the industry an increasing edge in its competition with fossil fuels. The average 1 megawatt-plus ground-mounted solar system will cost 73 cents a watt by 2025, compared with $1.14 now — a 36 percent drop, said Jenny Chase, head of solar analysis for New Energy Finance. That's in step with other forecasts. The solar supply chain is experiencing “a Wal-Mart effect” from higher volumes and lower margins, said Sami Khoreibi, founder and chief executive officer of Enviromena Power Systems, an Abu Dhabi-based developer. The speed at which the price of solar will drop below coal varies in each country. Places that import coal or tax polluters with a carbon price, such as Europe and Brazil, will see a crossover in the 2020s, if not before. Countries with large domestic coal reserves such as India and China will probably take longer. Coal industry officials point out that cost comparisons involving renewables don't take into account the need to maintain backup supplies that can work when the sun doesn't shine or wind doesn't blow. When those other expenses are included, coal looks more economical, even around 2035, said Benjamin Sporton, chief executive officer of the World Coal Association. “All advanced economies demand full-time electricity,” Sporton said. “Wind and solar can only generate part-time, intermittent electricity. While some renewable technologies have achieved significant cost reductions in recent years, it's important to look at total system costs.”Sunbelt countries are leading the way in cutting costs, though there's more to it than just the weather. The use of auctions to award power-purchase contracts is forcing energy companies to compete with each other to lower costs. An August auction in Chile yielded a contract for 2.91 cents a kilowatt hour. In September, a United Arab Emirates auction grabbed headlines with a bid of 2.42 cents a kilowatt hour. Developers have been emboldened to submit lower bids by expectations that the cost of the technology will continue to fall. “We're seeing a new reality where solar is the lowest-cost source of energy, and I don't see an end in sight in terms of the decline in costs,” Enviromena's Khoreibi said.

Blue Cross and Prime Therapeutics have developed new preferred pharmacy networks as of Jan. 1 that do not include CVS, according to Koko Mackin, vice president of corporate communications and community relations for Blue Cross. “This change was made to help offset the continuous rise in prescription drug costs,” Mackin said. “The new pharmacy networks will provide the best medications for the best price.” Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama is part owner of Prime Therapeutics, which is a pharmacy benefit manager based in St. Paul, Minnesota. Mackin said CVS is the only national chain not participating in the new networks. “Prime was able to secure more cost-effective prescription drug prices from Walgreens and other pharmacies,” Mackin said when asked why CVS is not in the new networks. Gary Serby, director of corporate communications for CVS in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, said it was not the company’s choice to be excluded from the Prime Therapeutics network. Alabama residents covered by Blue Cross likely will have to transfer their prescription medicine shopping from CVS to other drug stores. Louise Jones, executive director of the Alabama Pharmacy Association, said the association was notified last fall of Blue Cross’ new preferred provider network. She said the association believes in freedom of choice for drug stores and the public. “The APA supports a system that provides an open network for pharmacies that want to participate,” she said. “We think patients should be able to choose where they go to get their medications.” The Alabama Department of Insurance has no authority over the matter, spokesman Stephen Holmes said. Chains such as Walgreens and Wal-Mart are in the new networks, along with many local independent drug stores, Mackin said. She said consumers can find a participating drug store online at AlabamaBlue.com/pharmacy. Any pharmacy network changes for employer plans will occur when the employer’s plan is renewed, which can be any time during the year, Mackin said. Prime Therapeutics and Walgreens announced their alliance jointly last fall. Blue Cross or its affiliates in 14 states own Prime Therapeutics, which is the fourth-largest pharmacy benefit management company in the country. Blue Cross in other states in the ownership group includes Florida, Texas, California, North Carolina and Minnesota. A pharmacy benefit manager administers prescription drug programs, according to the American Pharmacists Association. A pharmacy benefit manager develops and maintains a list of prescription drugs covered by an insurance plan; negotiates discounts and rebates with drug manufacturers; contracts with pharmacies; and processes and pays prescription drug claims, the association said. CVS’s loss of Blue Cross business comes on the heels of being dropped from the network for TRICARE, the health insurance program for active U.S. military members and veterans, on Dec. 1. CVS Health Corp. projects it will lose more than 40 million prescriptions in 2017 because of the new pharmacy networks that exclude CVS drug stores, according to the company’s third-quarter earnings report. Serby said 180 of CVS’s more than 9,600 drug stores are in Alabama. “We have no announcement on any closings,” he said. keith.clines@decaturdaily.com or 256-340-2438.

Say what you want — Trump is one tough cookie You can blame Obama's 'gig economy' for the election How Trump can negotiate his way to success as president Dear John: It may be true that the Social Security Trust Fund is a myth, but before you guffaw at privatizing it, take a look at what Canada has done to its version of Social Security. Theirs is invested in stocks and is much more robust and secure than ours. I’m sick and tired of people like “J.R.” in your Dec. 11 column, who seem to blame George W. Bush for every problem in their lives. Bush wasn’t perfect, but compared to Obama, he is Washington, Lincoln and Reagan rolled into one. C.H. Dear C.H.: How’d we get to knocking Obama? Let’s get back to the issue. Privatizing Social Security, to me, means allowing people to have control over how the money they contributed into this government retirement plan is invested. It can’t be done. Why? Because the only assets in the mythical trust fund are government bonds. In order to allow people to move their trust fund money into something else, those bonds would have to be sold. If the bonds now being held in the Social Security Trust Fund are sold, then Washington would have to find someone else to buy its billions of bonds each year. And without the Social Security Trust Fund buying US government bonds on a regular basis, Washington couldn’t function. Privatizing Social Security? Get the thought out of your head. It physically can’t be done even if FDR himself ordered it. Dear John: I received a bill from Midland Funding LLC that is threatening to take a debt to a collection agency. I have never had an account with this company. I wrote to them when I first got this note, or statement. So I don’t think I should pay them. Thank you for your advice. A.J. Dear A.J.: First things first: When you write a letter to me or anyone asking for help, you should include your phone number. Because you didn’t — and because I couldn’t find one — you are not likely to get my advice in time. Anyway, you don’t recognize Midland Funding because this is a company that buys up bad debt and then tries to collect. And since I’m not the person whose name is on this account, and because I couldn’t reach you, I could only get a little bit of information from the company’s call center in India. The debt seems to result from something you did with GE Money Bank, which appears to be a credit card company. And it might be related to something you purchased at Walmart. Or this could be totally bogus. I can’t tell and only you would know. The letter from Midland Funding says, “Congratulations! You have been pre-approved for a discount program designed to save you money.” That, of course, is crap. You didn’t win anything. Midland is trying to collect as much of the debt it says you owe because it probably bought that debt at a steep discount. SEE ALSO Social Security won't be privatized -- even under Trump :0 Dear John: I can promise you that a great number... Social Security won't be privatized -- even under Trump But here’s the tricky and dangerous part that you probably won’t get in time for you to act upon. According to a document you sent me, you have a hearing scheduled for Jan. 12 at Nassau County District Court. You SHOULD attend even if you don’t think you owe money. If you don’t show up, Midland will probably ask for, and get, a default judgment and get its money by attaching your salary, or Social Security payments or assets. Be at the court at 9:30 a.m. and plead your case. If nothing else, you can get an adjournment until you are able to prove this isn’t your $1,700.41 debt. If you suddenly do remember owing this on your credit card, then you should work out some sort of payment schedule with Midland. If you think that someone else has illegally purchased something with one of your credit cards, then you should notify the credit monitoring agencies so they can keep an eye out for future fraud. Doing nothing is the wrong approach. Hope that helps. Dear Readers, Your letters to John Crudele are streaming in fast and furiously, asking Dear John to right the wrongs you’re facing.

By Gene Collier / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette The Miami Dolphins could not possibly have been aware of it at the time, but in December of 2000, when that dimming historical bulb that marks their last win in a playoff game was new, the young man most vital for delivering their next postseason victory had just arrived in America on a flight from London with his Nigerian parents. And here’s something else they could not possibly have known, much less wanted to: That young man was 7 years old. “We lived in Maryland for a year,” Jay Ajayi said on the phone the other day without much reflection on Miami’s last splash of postseason success. “Then we moved to Texas.” And the rest is football history, albeit slightly goofy football history, the narrative of which we’ll lay out presently, but if you don’t know who Jay Ajayi is, you weren’t paying strict attention on Oct. 16, when Ajayi darted from the Miami backfield toward a flummoxed Steelers defense on runs of 6, 6, 7, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 20, 33, and 62 yards. His 204-yard rushing total was the third most against Pittsburgh since 1960, and it delivered a 30-15 Dolphins victory that turned a curdling season around in Miami. The Fish, a floundering 1-4 when Ajayi did that, are a great white 9-2 since. You’d likely hope the defensive employees of the home team at Heinz Field this afternoon have familiarized themselves with the talents of the affable Nigerian. “That was an ugly week for us,” said Steelers defensive tackle Stephon Tuitt, “especially when we came back here and had to watch the film. Ugly. We even had to sit down, just ourselves with the coaches, and they talked to us about how we wanted this season to end up going.” I’d love to have the audio of John Mitchell, assistant head coach/defensive line and a man who learned his coachly demeanor at the knee of Bear Bryant, delivering his pointed interpretation of what exactly happened to the Steelers that day in South Florida. “He don’t want nobody to get 50 yards,” Tuitt recounted, “so when we gave up 200, he was freakin’ losin’ it.” Tuitt says the defense has grown from that, using almost the same words linebacker Lawrence Timmons deployed this week against similar questions, which were the same words used by cornerback Ross Cockrell and anyone else you asked inside the Steelers locker room. Funny, it sounded vaguely like the bleating of the Buffalo Bills last month as they readied to endure Jay Ajayi for the second time this season. In their first meeting, Ajayi lacerated Rex Ryan’s defense for 214 yards, which came a week after his 204 against the Steelers, meaning the short list of humans who’d run for 200 yards in consecutive NFL games now read: O.J. Simpson, Earl Campbell, Ricky Williams, Jay Ajayi. “We think we’ll be much more effective this game,” Ryan told New York writers during Christmas week. “Were we tired? Yeah … it was about 100 degrees out there (actually 81), but that won’t be the case this week. That was at their place, now I’m excited to have them in our building. I truly believe we’re going to play a great game.” So on Christmas Eve, the Bills encountered Ajayi again. It was 38 degrees. He gained 206 yards. Ryan was soon fired. Now, only six players in league history — Simpson, Campbell, Tiki Barber, LaDainian Tomlinson, Jim Brown, Barry Sanders — have more 200-yard rushing games than Jay Ajayi. It took each of them between seven and 11 years. It took Ajayi 10 games. “When somebody runs the ball (like) that, we have to respect them,” said linebacker Ryan Shazier, who sat out the game in Miami with an injury. “You have to give them all due respect and play them like they’re one of the best running backs in the world. (But) you don’t want nobody doing that to you; I don’t care if it’s a superstar or a nobody.” Ajayi’s improbable odyssey from nobody to superstar goes all the way back to West Africa, where his father, Ibi Ajayi, observed in the 1990s that Nigeria was probably not the happiest place on earth. He moved to London where another Nigerian immigrant, Kemi, became his wife and mother to Ajayi. Soon enough Ibi would land a job in Maryland and another in Plano, Texas, a year later. The first thing Texans noticed about Jay Ajayi was the joy. “He was always a great kid, full of life; whenever you watch him play, he still has that youthful exuberance about him,” said Brandon Gonzales, his coach in both middle school and at Liberty High (official motto: Work Hard, Be Nice). “He’s got the biggest smile I’ve ever seen. He really enjoys living.” But to quote an ancient football axiom, you don’t get a scholarship to Boise State on joie de vivre alone. “I always thought he had great ability,” Gonzales said. “I was defensive coordinator, and the things he could do at safety were unbelievable. He could have been a great safety, but I knew any offense would steal him.” Before Jay could flash across that ridiculous blue carpet in Idaho, there was some turbulence. Ajayi was nabbed for trying to lift some sweatpants from a local Walmart, after which his parents and then Boise State coach Chris Petersen put the fear of God into him, ending his fledgling career as The Sweatpants Bandit. Things smoothed out, except maybe for that time he was caught on video drinking pickle juice from a jar on the Broncos sideline, a jar with the pickles still in it. “I was cramping,” he said. Oh. Well. Before he left the Northwest, Ajayi became the first major college player ever to accumulate 1,800 rushing yards and 500 receiving yards in the same season, that being a junior year when he scored 32 touchdowns, catapulting himself into the 2015 draft. A year after they chose him as one of four fifth-round draft picks they were holding, the Dolphins were just completely, thoroughly, unequivocally ... unimpressed. They pursued free agents C.J. Anderson and Chris Johnson to be their featured back this season, then finally signed veteran Arian Foster, who won the job over Ajayi in training camp. Disgruntled, Ajayi moaned enough to get left off the traveling squad for new coach Adam Gase’s inaugural game at Seattle. “I had my adversity and challenges early, but I’m grateful for the opportunities and just takin’ advantage of it and being able to showcase to the world what I can do,” Ajayi said via conference call this week. “For me it’s all good, but I believe I’m only gettin’ started in the NFL and I’m grateful to my o-line and my whole team for just helpin’ me have a productive year. “Defenses definitely respect our running game now. They’ve been doing a lot of things to try and make us a little bit more one-dimensional. Stacking the box, givin’ us different looks, and schemes. Whatever the defense gives us, if we just execute and our o-line comes off the ball physical, downhill, I’m runnin’ hard, and our receivers do what they do on the perimeter, we’ll be fine.” With Miami bringing a backup quarterback to the club’s first post-season game in eight years, Ajayi’s role is only further inflated. If he can help backup Matt Moore keep Ben Roethlisberger, Le’Veon Bell, and Antonio Brown on the home sideline for 35 minutes or so, Miami could get that first playoff win since Ajayi was a pup. Interestingly, Mike Tomlin avoided saying Ajayi’s name in his presser this week, likely an acknowledgement that while the coach’s English remains floridly exquisite, his familiarity with the yoruban dialect of West Africa is less so. Ajayi’s name is pronounced uh-Jye-ee; rhyming with the way Tomlin praised him: To thuh-Sky-ee. “He’s got a sturdy body; he’s got a great pad level,” Tomlin said. “His shoulders almost always roll forward. He plays with a good natural base which allows him to have great contact balance and bounce off of would-be tacklers.” In a real sense, that’s what this first or last chapter of the Steelers postseason comes down to, the would-be tacklers. It’s a simple little prayer for the Terrible Towel crowd: Would that the would-be tacklers would be tacklers. Amen.

The Ong family - (front row, from left) Mr Dan Ong, Isaiah, Abigail, Mrs Sue Ong, (back row, from left) Asher, Magdalena, Michaela and Isaac - at Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming.PHOTO: COURTESY OF ASHER ONG The Ong family went on a six-month trip to the United States in 2015 and their travel stories are published in a new book Published: Jan 8, 2017, 5:00 am SGT More Share Tweet Linkedin Pin Google+ Reddit Print Purchase Article Permalink: http://str.sg/4PKp Copy Venessa Lee venessal@sph.com.sg Educator Dan Ong, his wife Sue and their six children took a six-month road trip across the United States in 2015. One of the parents' fondest memories of the adventure does not involve the Statue of Liberty nor the Grand Canyon - it is the family sharing a loaf of bread when they ran out of money. "I saw the children's understanding of the situation. They were taking care of one another. We were rationing what we had," says Mr Ong, 45, a programme manager and educator at a learning centre. The incident is one of many adventures that Mrs Ong, 41, a stay-at-home mum, has written about in a book on their trip, 6 Kids And A Pop-up Camper. Launched last month, the book features photographs taken by eldest son Asher, 16, and contributions from the rest of the family. It retails for $61.95 at 6kidsandapopupcamper.com. They travelled to 43 out of 50 American states in six months, clocking more than 21,000km. Mr Ong estimates they spent about $50,000 in total, and did not stay in hotels or motels. Mrs Ong's childhood dream, influenced by growing up watching Sesame Street and American sitcoms, was to travel to the US. What might seem like a radical American holiday to some was merely the Ongs' way of seeing as much of the country as they could on a shoestring budget. By the numbers Fast facts about the Ong family's trip to the United States: 8 people went to 1 country, where they visited 43 states 20 cities 24 campsites 20 national parks 20 museums 7 capitol buildings and 2 military bases, as well as saw 2 space shuttles and bought 108 fridge magnets 21,139 kilometres was the total distance they travelled. "We wanted to have a shared experience as a family, something special that only eight of us would have, before the kids grow up and move on," says Mrs Ong. The Ongs decided to do the road trip in 2015, using their savings and some money given by family members, because their firstborn Asher, then 15, would eventually have to do his national service and tertiary education, and would be unable to travel for six months. Before their youngest child, Michaela, was born, they took their five children on a 24-hour coach trip from Singapore to Ranong in southern Thailand. Although the children - aged four to 16 - are homeschooled, the family's preparations for the trip included getting permission from the Ministry of Education for their son, Isaac, who was due to take the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) in 2015, to defer taking the examination till the following year. Homeschooled children are not exempt from this national examination. Mr Ong also had to leave his job of 17 years as a secondary school teacher to go on the trip. Mrs Ong also got the older children, the youngest of whom was three at the time, to look at online resources such as information on antebellum houses in Charleston, South Carolina, and watch snippets of Gone With The Wind (1939). With a view to writing a book, hopefully to recoup costs, the family started a public Facebook page to document the journey. It now has about 9,200 followers. Besides keeping up with their church and family friends in the US and Singapore, they met strangers who contacted them through Facebook. Initially uncomfortable that the children were not studying much, though they had taken along textbooks on the trip, Mrs Ong soon experienced a "paradigm shift". She says: "The kids were learning so much. They were looking at mountains and valleys and encountered hail. We saw flash floods unfold in Zion National Park in Utah." They also learnt what they had to do as a family to pull through tough times. In South Dakota, Mr Ong tried to withdraw cash from an ATM, only to realise he had reached his credit limit. Dangerously low on petrol and food, they waited for the funds to be transferred. The children sat at a foodcourt and waited as their parents tried in vain to access the money at their bank branch. The family eventually scrounged for loose change in their pockets and in the used station wagon they had bought in the US for the trip. They had spent $8,000 on the car and the camper trailer, in which they slept at night when they were not staying with friends. They rustled up enough to buy a loaf of bread, which they ate with leftovers: ham, soggy lettuce and Cheerios, a breakfast cereal. Later that day, Mr Ong tried his luck again at a petrol kiosk and, unexpectedly, the card cleared his request to buy petrol. They drove to their next destination, Casper, Wyoming, where they stopped for the night at a campsite and Mrs Ong cooked instant noodles. She says: "We never imagined how a trip could change our lives. When you do a trip like this, you put yourself out there, you make yourself vulnerable. We met new people, which opened up new opportunities. If you planned everything to the letter, you might miss out on something." Besides Americans who welcomed them into their homes, many Singaporeans in the US contacted the family to arrange to meet. A Singaporean they met at a barbecue, organised by another Singaporean, was working at Pixar and gave the family free tickets to Disneyland, worth about $1,000. Mrs Ong had told the children they were not going to Disneyland as they could not afford it. Having a tight budget meant "we lived like vagabonds for six months", says Mrs Ong. The family mostly visited free attractions such as museums and monuments. They did not have much cash for souvenirs, although Mrs Ong bought 108 fridge magnets to commemorate their trip. They spent prudently, for instance, investing in a family pass to the national parks for US$80 (S$115). Besides visiting attractions such as the Statue of Liberty, they saw 20 of about 60 national parks in the country, including Yellowstone National Park. They often slept in their camper, which the boys and Mr Ong set up when it was time for bed. The camper covering, made of canvas, meant they had to put up with temperatures of between 10 and 40 deg C. On several occasions, there was no campsite available, so they spent the night at a Walmart carpark, sleeping in the car as they were not allowed to open up campers, says Mrs Ong, who learnt to wash her hair in public toilets. "You learn to adapt. We're resilient," says Asher. Around the US on a tight budget   Mrs Sue Ong's tips on taking a long trip in the United States with a big family on a small budget: • Buy an old but well-maintained car. They are affordable by Singapore standards. At the end of the trip, you can sell it and recoup some of the costs. • Skip hotels and make your own sleeping arrangements, for example, sleeping in a camper or tents. Camp grounds are affordable and easy to find. • Skip restaurants. Shop for groceries and cook simple meals. "If you have no opportunity to cook, we found affordable options such as fresh and nutritious submarine sandwiches sold in the larger grocery stores. The large pizzas sold at 7-Eleven stores in the US were also a favourite with our kids," Mrs Ong says. • Skip tourist attractions that charge fees. "The US is not short on wonderful things to see and do for free. For example, most of the world-class museums in Washington, DC are free of charge to visit," she says. • Shop at thrift stores. It is not difficult to find them in any American city or town. These stores are typically large and sell just about anything you need, such as clothes (including winter clothing), shoes and kitchen necessities.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint Scrap collectors a few weeks ago stole brass signs off the giant building Macy’s abandoned in 2013 in downtown St. Louis. An electrical fire last summer damaged a Macy’s store that closed in 2015 in downtown Pittsburgh. And in the building Macy’s vacated in Missoula, Mont., there’s a different problem. “It’s just sitting there housing pigeons,” says Ellen Buchanan, director of the Missoula Redevelopment Agency. “They don’t spend a lot of money at the local restaurants.” The departure of a giant department store creates a chance to update and modernize a city center. But it also creates risks, and even danger, as a large empty building goes untended. Last week’s decision by Macy’s Inc. to close its downtown store in Minneapolis means the city will be balancing those opportunities and risks for the first time since the 1980s, when a fire in a vacant department store destroyed a city block. The firm purchasing the Macy’s site, a three-building complex known to most Minnesotans as the former flagship Dayton’s store, is sending executives to discuss its future with city officials this week. “We want to see a new entity there as quickly as possible,” City Council President Barb Johnson said. “But we realize how long it takes to have things happen.” For five decades, American cities have grappled with the closings of big department stores in downtowns, first because of competition from suburban malls and, lately, off-price and internet retailers. Each closing reduces shopping variety, wipes out jobs and reduces the local tax base. Other closings Pittsburgh • 1.2 million square feet • Closed 2015 • Core Realty, plans to name the 50,000 square feet of retail on the building’s first floor after the Kaufmann’s that used to be there. It also plans more than 300 luxury apartments and a 155-room hotel. St. Louis • 1.2 million square feet • Closed 2013 • Hudson Holdings is considering converting the 21-story building into residences, stores and a hotel. Spokane • 374,000 square feet • Closed 2016 • Centennial Properties plans to have retail and apartments in the space. Honolulu • 80,000 square feet • Closed 2013 • Wal-Mart paid $26 million to purchase the property and spent $6 million to renovate it. Boise • 115,721 square feet • Closed 2010 • Athlos Academies bought the property in 2015 for offices and training facilities for charter school teachers. St. Paul • 529,053 square feet • Closed 2013 • The St. Paul Port Authority and Hempel Cos. are expected to spend $63 million to remodel. The Wild will have a rink and training facility. Missoula • 80,000 square feet • Closed 2010 • A developer wants to raze the two-story building and replace it with a hotel, but preservationists are fighting the plan. Each also challenges a city’s commercial real estate base with a huge parcel that has to be torn down and replaced, or remodeled and put back on the market. The buyer of the Minneapolis property, 601W Cos., a New York real estate developer, will remodel it into a mix of retail and offices, Macy’s said in announcing the $40 million transaction. The conversion won’t be easy, said David Frank, the Minneapolis director of economic policy and development. “Some buildings lend themselves well and easily and less expensively to new uses, but department stores aren’t one of those,” he said. At its mid-20th century peak, Minneapolis had four, block-long department stores along Nicollet Avenue. Each closing led to redevelopment. But they did not all go smoothly. On Thanksgiving Day 1982, shortly after Donaldson’s department store moved from its six-story building to then-new City Center across the street, arsonists started a fire that spread quickly to the Northwestern National Bank building next door. The fire was the costliest in the city’s history to that point and led to the demolition of the two buildings and construction of what is now Wells Fargo Center and Gaviidae Common, a rebuilding process that took six years. Other Macy’s closings The Minneapolis Macy’s is the largest of the 68 that the Cincinnati-based company has said it will close this year. The company, which has downsized occasionally since becoming the nation’s largest department-store operator in 2005, will also vacate downtown stores in Portland, Ore., and Santa Barbara, Calif. At just over 1 million square feet, the Minneapolis site is comparable in size to the one Macy’s closed in St. Louis in 2013 and one in downtown Pittsburgh in 2015 — and twice the size of the one it closed in St. Paul in 2013. Most of the company’s closings in recent years have been in suburban malls. In addition to Missoula, Pittsburgh, St. Louis and St. Paul, Macy’s since 2010 closed downtown stores in Boise, Idaho; Honolulu; and Spokane, Wash. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. took over the Honolulu location, and all the others except St. Louis and Missoula are actively being redeveloped. In St. Paul, the Port Authority purchased the downtown Macy’s in 2014 and, last spring, finalized plans with Minneapolis developer Hempel Cos. to remake it into a mixed-use complex anchored by a new practice facility for the Wild. Department store buildings present unique challenges in redevelopment. While there is some appeal in expansive space, the trade-off is that most of the space isn’t close to a window, meaning little natural light. Many department stores require environmental remediation because they were built when developers used materials, such as asbestos, that have since been deemed unsafe, Frank said. “It’s a significant cost to retrofit it,” said Russ Nelson, president of NTH real estate and project management. “Getting tenants who will lease space at rates that make the investment work, I think that’s a challenge.” A challenging market 601W may face some challenges filling the office space given the amount of inventory in the market. According to a market report released last week by JLL, a lot of mediocre Class B office space in Minneapolis may languish without significant capital improvements. And there are other signs that the Minneapolis commercial real estate market, after several years of fast growth and new construction, is plateauing. Two blocks away from the downtown Macy’s, a developer last year backed down from replacing the former TCF Bank Building with a 50-story tower, opting for a modest upgrade that’s now underway. Meanwhile, at the north end of Nicollet Mall, another developer is scrambling to line up a financing partner for a hoped-for 40-story hotel and residential tower. The Macy’s buildings may have some features that could be preserved. They were deemed eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places and may qualify for a local designation, Frank said. That could yield some financial benefits to the developer but would also lead to some restrictions. The redevelopment of Missoula’s old Macy’s building, known locally as the Mercantile, was brought to a standstill after preservationists sued the city and a developer that wanted to raze the property for a hotel. “It’s a sore thumb,” Buchanan said. “It’s just sitting there with a chain-link fence. Macy’s leaving has had a significant impact on downtown retail. We are recovering from it, but we are not going to fully recover until that property is occupied again.” In downtown St. Louis, city officials are talking with a potential buyer for the century-old building Macy’s last occupied, called the Railway Exchange. The prospect wants to turn its 21 stories into a mix of residences, stores and a hotel. “It’s ideal for a large user, but it has been difficult attracting somebody to be the developer for the entire space,” said Otis Williams, director of the St. Louis Development Corp. In November, thieves stole 10 brass signs off the building that said “Famous-Barr,” the name of the regional department store that occupied the site before Macy’s. The rest were taken down to prevent further vandalism.   Twitter: @nicolenorfleet   nicole.norfleet@startribune.com 612-673-4495 View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

There are a lot of great tips here. While some of them only apply to auto mechanics, many of them are applicable to all sorts of shop work. There are a few here that have definitely gone into my mental bag of tricks for future use. I bet you’ll find the same. Here are 13 of my favorite tips culled from the two videos. Rubber Band DVOM Mode Reminder When using a DVOM (Digital Volt-Ohm Meter), it’s easy to leave the leads in current-reading mode which can cause real problems if you try and test voltage on the meter. The least you can do is blow the meter’s fuse, the worst is short out an expensive electronic part, like a power-train control module (PCM). To give yourself a reminder that you’re in Amperage/Current mode, place a rubber band over the dial. This way, when you go to use the DVOM again, the band over the dial reminds you to switch the red lead back to voltage detection mode before testing. Securing Ramps That Want to Travel If you’re trying to drive your car onto some portable shop ramps and the ramps keep sliding away from the front wheels on the smooth floor of your garage, tie some nylon strapping to the holes in the ramps and situate the other ends so that your back wheels roll over them. And up the ramp you go. Using Wax to Free a Frozen Bolt We can add this to our growing list of useful methods for unfreezing bolts. Here, you heat the frozen nut with a torch and then melt candle wax into the bolt threads. Repeat as needed until the nut can be worked free. Rolling Parts Trays from a Tranny Pan Matt took an old transmission pan and welded some small casters on it to make a shop-floor rolling parts tray. Holding a Bolt in a Wrench This one is a keeper. To hold a bolt in a wrench or extension when you need your other hand free, put a little chunk of paper towel over the head of the bolt before slipping it onto the wrench. This will create a friction fit tight enough to hold your bolt but loose enough that you can easily pull the wrench away when the bolt is secure. Make a Groovy Pair of Pliers Sometimes old, stubborn hose clamps can be tough to pry off with regular pliers (the little metal release tabs can be slippery). To address this, Matt cut some grooves in a pair of bent needle nose pliers. This groove engages with the tab and gives you a good grip for prying the clamp apart. …And a Cushy Pair When trying to remove hosing that is good and stuck, you can sometimes tear up the rubber material with conventional pliers. By wrapping some hockey tape (or other grippy tape), you can create a pair of pliers that are more forgiving to marable surfaces. Make a Funnel from an Oil Container A handy funnel for hands-free pouring of 1 qt. oil containers can be made by simply cutting the bottom off of an old 1 qt. oil container. Use a Flashlight to Check Fluid Levels It is often hard to view fluids levels in those milk-white plastic reservoirs (often coated with dust and grease) found in car engines. Shining a flashlight up against the plastic will reveal the fluid level inside the container. Cleaning Bucket Drip Tray Matt gets these two-bay cleaning buckets on sale, two for $5, at stores like Walmart and Target. They fit perfectly over the box steel tubing of his engine stand, making a perfect drip tray that can travel the floor with the stand. Tape a Spare Fuse to your Meters It’s always a good idea to tape an extra fuse to the back of your multimeter so that it’s handy if you blow one. Pickle Lid Oil Tester When changing oil, place a little of the old oil into a jar lid that had a gloss-white interior. By shining a light onto the smear of oil in the lid, you will be able to see any metal particles, bearing bits, coolant, or other contaminants in your oil. Waterproofing Heatshrink Tubing To create a more waterproof seal for heatshrink tubing, apply some dielectric grease to the wire you are insulating, slide on the tubing, and heat as normal. As the tubing shrinks, it will squeeze out the excess grease and leave you with a very waterproof seal.

Load shedding continues unabated despite PM’s claims 16-Jan-17 221 ISLAMABAD: The announcement ma ... Donald Trump won the presidency, in large part, by promising working class voters that he would create lots of new jobs by imposing tariff taxes on imported goods. One of the big problems with the US economy, he told voters, is that we've been sending jobs overseas through bad trade agreements that flood our stores with low priced imports. That may be good for consumers, but not for US labor struggling to earn a living wage. The simplistic answer, Mr. Trump told us, is to impose trade taxes, known as tariffs, on those imports, making them far more costly and thus create a level playing field that would strengthen our economy and make us more competitive. It wasn't a new idea, but one that has been promoted by organized labor and politically powerful union bosses and their liberal allies in the Democratic Party throughout our industrial history. But it isn't all it's cracked up to be and is contrary to all of the available evidence that shows trade tariffs hurt low income consumers, businesses and our overall economy. More than a year ago, when the billionaire mogul was preparing to enter the GOP presidential race, economists Stephen Moore and Larry Kudlow wrote a brilliant piece for Investors Business Daily that warned of the dangers in Mr. Trump's plan. "Here's a historical fact that Donald Trump, and many voters attracted to him, may not know: The last American president who was a trade protectionist was Republican Herbert Hoover," they wrote. "Obviously that economic strategy didn't turn out so well - either for the nation or the GOP," they wrote, then posed this question: "Does Trump aspire to be a 21st century Hoover with a modernized platform of the 1930 Smoot-Hawley tariffs that helped send the US and world economy into a decade-long depression and a collapse of the banking system?" Yes, Mr. Trump is right when he complains about the unfair trading practices by China and other economies around the world - pirating our technologies and patents, and counterfeiting our goods, say Mr. Moore and Mr. Kudlow. "But clapping Trump's punitive tariff on imported Chinese goods will hurt Americans at least as much as it does Beijing," they said. Many voters may have forgotten that Trump's proposed 35 percent tariff on imported goods is nothing more than a tax added to the cost of the products they buy. Not only would it be "the biggest tax increase on US consumers in modern times," the two noted conservative economists said, it would hurt the most vulnerable people in our economy. "Wal-Mart has been one of the greatest anti-poverty programs in world history, and it has achieved the 'everyday low prices' that greatly benefit the poor and middle class in part through low-cost imports," they point out. Prices at these and other discount chain stores would rise sharply under Mr. Trump's tariffs, hurting retail businesses across the country, resulting in store closings, widespread layoffs and a weaker economy. "Economists are famous for disagreeing with one another," writes Harvard's conservative economist Greg Mankiw, but there is surprisingly uniform agreement on the harm tariffs can inflict on our economy. Last year, "a panel of 51 leading economists of differing ideological views were asked to respond to this statement: "Adding new or higher import duties on products such as air conditioners, cars and cookies to encourage producers to make them in the US would be a good idea."

Home Contact Us About History Slideshow Ad2 Editorial Business Crime Features FrontPage General Weekend News Breaking News General / Weekend News Mexico in social unrest after gas price hike Posted by The Reporter Newspaper on January 6, 2017 at 1:46 pm By Michelle Sutherland, Staff Reporter Massive social unrest in Mexico has sparked widespread protest, blockage of roads and looting of hundreds of stores over the past few days, spreading to the neighboring city of Chetumal. The protest was fueled by a recent sharp gasoline price hike that was introduced by the Mexican government on January 1, 2017. The government as a way of ending regulated prices for gasoline and diesel boosted the average price by 20%. According to several online articles, the price for a litre of premium gas is now $17.79 pesos. That makes 4 litres or about a gallon equal to nearly as much as Mexico’s recently-increased minimum wage for a day’s work. Recent reports have indicated that several stores which Belizeans frequent have been targeted by looters such as Walmart, Plaza de las Americas, Chedraui and Aurera. Belizeans who visit Chetumal to take advantage of the lower gas prices will be affected by the increase; however not by much, since the recent increase is still lower than what we pay here in Belize. Online articles have suggested that four people have lost their lives amids the social unrest, and more than 1,000 others have been arrested for looting. Over 300 stores have been broken into and damaged. Roads are blocked by truckers as people demonstrate in the streets, fires are set to several establishments as well as gas stations looted for gas, department stores and pharmacies broken into as officials try to keep the calm and contain the mob as all havoc broke loose in Mexico.

Can it rise again? Jan 5, 2017 Matthew Braga   1 (Illustration by Jasu Hu) Last February, Shop.ca was in trouble. The e-commerce startup was bleeding cash, and the board of directors was seeking a way to keep the company afloat. A group of existing investors was willing to pony up new funds and reached out to co-founder Drew Green. Although he retired as CEO in 2014 at age 40, Green remained the majority shareholder and a board member. The investor group had one big stipulation before pouring in more money: the shareholder agreement would have to be rewritten. Green would effectively be giving up rights he enjoyed as a co-founder, limiting his control over the company. The prospect of additional funding, combined with a new plan from management, offered Shop.ca not just a chance to survive for a while longer, but a shot at turning an actual profit. Moving ahead, however, proved anything but straightforward. Green had reason to maintain an interest in Shop.ca. He liked to say it was the largest online shopping site in Canada, and that it could one day become a billion-dollar company. Like many Canadians, Green was unimpressed with the state of e-commerce in this country. Duties, brokerage fees and shipping costs for products that were already priced higher here than in the U.S. made purchasing items online a miserable and expensive endeavour—assuming shoppers could even find what they were looking for in the first place. The Crazy Story of What Really Went Wrong at Target Canada Green proposed an alternative: a marketplace that carried items customers actually wanted, shipped from Canadian sellers to Canadian buyers, with no added fees. Shop.ca would function like a virtual department store and boast more than 25 product categories, including toys, electronics, baby goods, and apparel. In the world of Canadian tech startups, which tend to build dull business-to-business products and services, Shop.ca stood out when it launched in 2012—boldly eschewing the enterprise crowd for everyday consumers. The concept was enough to attract more than $70 million in funding, along with a handful of notable names. Author and businessman Don Tapscott joined as advisor, and Bill Gregson, the former CEO of The Brick, signed on to the board. Despite the funding and in-house retail expertise, Shop.ca led a rocky existence and ended up filing for bankruptcy protection earlier this year. The company serves as a case study of the challenges that face many fledgling businesses—namely costly growth tactics and differing opinions on strategy. But Shop.ca was particularly troubled, a picture gleaned through numerous on- and off-the-record interviews with former staff and investors. Tensions among the executives and at the board level weighed on the company, and the relationship between Green and his co-founder, Trevor Newell, was left severed. Without these clashes, Shop.ca would have had a more successful run, according to a former company insider: “No doubt in my mind whatsoever.” Drew Green and Trevor Newell were, in fact, childhood friends. They were born in Toronto, in the same year, in the same month. The pair spent summers together at camp, and their families were close, too, even taking a trip to Disney World together. As they grew older, their interests diverged. Green studied kinesiology, while Newell opted for a degree in business administration. Green was later swept up in the dot-com boom, bouncing from Toronto to New York to Chicago, and by 2005, he was a senior vice-president at an American online comparison-shopping website called Shop.com. (In many ways, it served as a model for Shop.ca.) Newell, meanwhile, worked in product management and strategy for clients in professional services. Shopify COO Harley Finkelstein on the future of digital retail In 2010, Green got in touch with his childhood friend. Each was interested in starting ventures of his own, and both happened to involve e-commerce. Green saw that Canada lacked a market leader like Amazon, while Newell was intrigued by loyalty and rewards programs. The pair sketched out the plans for Shop.ca and quit their jobs in 2011 to pursue it full-time. Green, as the majority shareholder, assumed the CEO role, while Newell was president. Shop.ca raised $27.4 million ahead of its launch in July 2012, a round led by Torstar Corp. and including capital from Slaight Communications. The company made its office in a 1,600-square-foot loft downtown. There was beer in the fridge and a ladder in the kitchen, built by Newell’s dad, that led to a roof where early employees would sometimes gather for lunch. “[The] office culture at Shop.ca was defined by extremely hard-working staff that came in early and would often leave after 8 or 10 p.m. at night,” Green wrote in an email to Canadian Business. In the year prior to launch, he says he drove eight to 10 hours between Toronto and Chicago to see his wife and children on weekends until the family moved back to Canada. The site earned a lengthy write-up in the Globe and Mail around the time of its debut. Green was described as looking like “the host of a wild party, the morning after.” He stood at over six feet tall, with a scraggly beard and circles under his eyes; Newell, on the other hand, was clean-shaven and came across as the more buttoned-down of the two. (He also serves as a Cub Scout leader, and includes the organization’s motto on his LinkedIn page.) Green, the charismatic salesman, signed deals and built relationships with merchants and marketers, while Newell worked behind the scenes. As a pure play marketplace, Shop.ca didn’t own any warehouses or ship products. Rather, it served as an intermediary, signing up retailers, brands, and distributors. Merchants handled inventory, shipping, and listing their products on the site, while Shop.ca assisted where necessary and looked after customer service, taking a cut of every sale. The company recruited more than 850 retailers, which allowed Shop.ca to boast a virtual inventory of more than 15 million items across 4,000 brands, including Samsung, Sony, Fila, and Miele, and retailers such as Sporting Life and Bad Boy. The hope was that Canadians who had grown accustomed to buying from myriad sites—or none at all—could get everything they needed in one place. “I think everyone had their own little personal story of trying to order something online and not being able to find it on a Canadian site,” says Scott LeBlanc, the company’s former director of product experience, and one its first employees. The plan hinged on one thing: scale. Shop.ca’s model reduced operating costs, but margins were razor thin. Generating millions of dollars in revenue each month was the only way to turn a profit. That meant selling all things to all people, and building a massive number of loyal, repeat customers—at all costs. In December 2013, Shop.ca gave discount codes to everyone who attended an NBA game between the Toronto Raptors and the Philadelphia 76ers, blanketing every seat in the Air Canada Centre with a sea of company-branded red flyers. It was a characteristically flashy advertising initiative. The company spent big on marketing, even sponsoring Toronto Maple Leafs left-winger Joffrey Lupul, and plastering its logo around the ACC during basketball games. To further entice shoppers, practically every item on the site shipped for free. Returns were free for up to a year. In 2013, the company spent $13 million on marketing and sales, equivalent to 60% of its annual revenue. After years in the slow lane, Canada's e-commerce ecosystem is booming The aggressive approach to marketing and customer acquisition is not uncommon for startups, nor was the focus on vanity metrics to showcase the company’s success. (In November of that year, for example, Shop.ca issued a press release announcing the site had its first “million-dollar day,” meaning more than $1 million in revenue earned over 24 hours.) But what neither could compensate for were bad customer reviews. “[The] prices were terrible,” complained one user on RedFlagDeals.com. “Literally nothing on that site you couldn’t get for cheaper elsewhere.” Others cited products that were frequently out of stock, faced shipping delays, or never shipped at all. Yet more complained of products that didn’t arrive as described, and difficulty reaching customer service. Even LeBlanc, an employee, encountered these problems. “If I didn’t work there I probably wouldn’t be shopping [there],” he says. Many of Shop.ca’s merchants lacked online selling experience, especially in the company’s early days. “It was pretty much anybody who wanted to come on, because we wanted as many diverse products as possible across many different categories,” says Aven Santo Domingo, one of Shop.ca’s former marketplace managers. He estimates that during Shop.ca’s first two years, more than half of the site’s merchants had never sold online before. This meant dealing with merchants who weren’t familiar with the intricacies of shipping and the costs involved, or best practices for describing a product. A merchant selling furniture, for example, might have neglected to include dimensions in a product’s description—if there was one. And while the site boasted of a large virtual inventory, it was hard to shake the feeling that much of it wasn’t very good. “When you have a directive of trying to get very big very fast, you will almost list everything and anything,” says Santo Domingo, who was responsible for onboarding merchants. The company later employed stricter merchant standards, but when customers encountered problems, there was only so much Shop.ca could do as an intermediary. Spending on customer acquisition intensified into 2014, and in May the company raised $31 million from the venture capital arm of Shaw Communications, alongside Shop.ca’s existing investors, which around that time valued the company at $200 million. That same month, Green negotiated a loyalty program with Aeroplan to court higher-income customers, scrapping Shop.ca’s own plan. Meanwhile, tensions were building inside the company. Concerns were brought to the board that Green was using company funds to pay for personal expenses, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter, and the directors established a committee to investigate. At the same time, a disagreement over strategy had been brewing. Some investors were pushing for Shop.ca to focus on profitability instead of scale, according to a former insider, who requested anonymity so as not to risk breaching a confidentiality agreement. “Whereas Drew felt that he was a mini-Amazon, and even if you lost money on every transaction, you can still grow the business and raise cash,” says the insider. In October of that year, Green departed the company. There was no fanfare, and Green told staff he was retiring to spend more time with his family. “It was unexpected,” LeBlanc says. (The company lost more than $20 million that year, according to bankruptcy documents.) “To be clear, my retirement did not stem from disagreements on the growth strategy of the company, nor was my retirement a result of my expense account,” Green wrote in an email to Canadian Business. “If at any time my corporate card was used instead of my personal card, it was paid back in full. These amounts were insignificant and only happened in the instance I did not have my personal card with me, or room on my personal card.” With one co-founder gone, the other was about to assert himself. Trevor Newell, Shop.ca’s president, was getting antsy. Change at the company was not happening fast enough under Green’s replacement, a longtime broadcast industry executive named Jamie Haggarty who assumed the CEO role in October 2014. (He’d served as Shop.ca’s chief operating officer since that April.) While the company was putting some emphasis on profitability—a second-quarter report to investors in 2015 obtained by Canadian Business highlights improvements to product margin and gross profit, for example—it continued spending heavily on marketing. Shop.ca raised another $15 million in May 2015 from existing investors, just to stay afloat. In August, Haggarty started exploring strategic alternatives, which meant either a sale or more funding. (He also told the press the company was considering an IPO.) The following month, the company signed a deal with Toronto-Dominion Bank that gave Aeroplan cardholders $50 to spend on Shop.ca along with 3,000 Aeroplan points, worth another $50. That meant Shop.ca was effectively paying customers more than $100 to shop on the site. The deal ran until December, and there was no limit on how many cardholders could take advantage of it. Many of them did—to the point where Shop.ca pulled the plug early. According to multiple sources, in no small part due to the TD deal, Shop.ca was on track to run out of cash by the end of 2015, and there was no compelling plan to reduce costs. How brick-and-mortar storefronts boost sales for online retailers By October, Newell had come up with his own plan. Supported by other members of the management team, Newell organized a call with the board’s strategic committee. “FYI, Jamie is not aware of this call,” he wrote in an email to the committee. “I am ready to lead; but I cannot do it without your support and action.” A change was necessary, given how the e-commerce landscape was evolving. Amazon had expanded its Canadian offerings, while retailers like Walmart and Canadian Tire were redoubling their online efforts as well. Not everyone on the committee responded positively to Newell’s proposed pivot, as he called it. “I understand that some members of the Strategic Committee believe that today’s call was a ‘coup d’etat,’” he wrote in a subsequent email in October. “I am not attempting to overthrow, I am not forcing a seizure. I am trying to communicate to you that I care, I am passionate, and I am showing leadership,” Newell continued, expressing his intent to give Haggarty “the opportunity to re-align or disagree.” Haggarty stepped down later that month. (Haggarty and Newell declined interviews.) He was replaced by Anthony Chvala, a former Amazon executive who had been on Shop.ca’s board for three months. First, he slashed marketing costs dramatically, which still accounted for $15.4 million by the end of 2015. “It was clear they wanted to grow top line as much as possible at whatever cost,” said Chvala. In addition to laying off 28 employees, about half of the company’s headcount, Chvala instructed staff to focus on curating the products and brands on Shop.ca’s platform, rather than try to sell everything to everyone. “We concentrated on some very core categories, based on some analytics that clearly showed those customers that were buying within those categories,” Chvala says. Home products, electronics, fashion and baby and children products carried higher margins and were more likely to attract repeat customers, according to bankruptcy filings. Chvala also intensified the company’s reliance on analytics to better track and understand the site’s most valuable customers. Finally, he suggested licensing the company’s custom merchant-facing technology, which helped sellers more easily input product data to the site. “There was optimism,” Santo Domingo recalls. “We were trying to be more data driven, which was something new, and something that gave us hope.” By February of 2016, some of Shop.ca’s existing cash investors had grown confident enough in Chvala’s plan that they had warmed to the idea of pursuing further investment—provided the shareholders agreement was revised. The group felt the agreement gave Green a disproportionate amount of power considering he was no longer at the company. According to multiple sources familiar with the matter, Green was told both in person and in writing that the company needed the funds to survive. Green says that he “confirmed verbally that I was willing to make any necessary changes to the shareholder agreement to support funding.” But Green says he never received a formal proposal detailing the suggested changes. The investor group apparently became convinced that Green would not budge and thus never bothered with a formal proposal. The talks were effectively a statement, according to one insider. The prospect of new financing died, and in the months that followed, there was an exodus from the company’s board. Chvala immediately set about trying to sell the company (Canadian Tire and Wal-Mart were among the potential suitors, according to the Globe and Mail) but despite receiving letters of intent from two large Canadian companies, both deals fell through. By the end of June, the company had just $1.5 million in cash, and executives expected to run out of money by August. With no potential suitors, and no one willing to invest, there was no choice but to file for bankruptcy protection to allow more time to find a buyer. The company, which had 40 employees at the time of the filing, held a going-out-of-business sale of sorts at its headquarters over the summer. Members of Toronto’s tech community picked over the office’s contents, claiming pieces of furniture with Post-it notes. “The office had just stunning, beautiful furniture,” recalls one attendee. What stuck out the most, however, were the large red letters hanging from the ceiling, spelling out the name Shop.ca. “That alone must have cost huge amounts of money.” The bankruptcy filing was not the end for Shop.ca. In July, a newly formed private equity firm called Transformational Capital acquired the company’s assets for an undisclosed sum. Transformational’s approach is the opposite of Shop.ca’s initial model in many ways, with a focus on profit instead of revenue growth. “We believe the new era of e-commerce is one that is grounded on sustainability,” says Ghassan Halazon, Transformational’s CEO, and the co-founder of daily deals site TeamBuy. To that end, the company is aiming to acquire troubled e-commerce companies and keep operating costs low by sharing resources. Halazon says that since purchasing Shop.ca’s assets, Transformational has renegotiated with merchants to secure more favourable margins. And because the site now shares an office in Toronto, a management team, and back-office costs with two other e-commerce brands (Halazon says the company is not yet prepared to name them), Shop.ca is on track to turn a profit. He concedes revenue is down, but argues that profitability is the “strongest weapon in ensuring we deliver to customers and merchants long-term.” How Indochino is suiting up for a massive retail expansion As for Green, he wrote to Canadian Business that, “I am as disappointed as anyone in the outcome.” In a previous email sent during the course of reporting, Green wrote, “Drew Green was the heart and soul of this company. In less than two years without his leadership, Shop.ca filed [for] bankruptcy protection and [was] consequently sold.” His retirement did not last long. Last December, he moved to Vancouver and became CEO of Indochino, the online men’s suit retailer. Newell is currently unemployed. Sources say the two no longer speak. Green has ambitious plans for Indochino, aiming to open 150 retail locations in the next five years and generate roughly $500 million in revenue by 2020. At Indochino, he gives a copy of The Alchemist, his favourite book, to every new hire. It’s an allegorical tale written by Paulo Coelho about a young boy on a quest to fulfill his destiny. The Alchemist is chock full of inspirational quotes and life lessons, including a few any entrepreneur would do well to heed. “Everything that happens once can never happen again,” Coelho writes. “But everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time.” Indigo CEO Heather Reisman on reimainging the 21st century bookstore MORE ABOUT DIGITAL RETAIL & E-COMMERCE: There’s no longer a difference between physical and digital retail Shopify CEO Tobias Lütke on how to maintain a startup culture at scale Shopify COO Harley Finkelstein on the future of digital retail Hybrid digital-physical stores will win the retail race in 2016 Indigo CEO Heather Reisman on reimainging the 21st century bookstore How brick-and-mortar storefronts boost sales for online retailers Made-to-measure tailor Indochino focuses on scale with a new CEO After years in the slow lane, Canada’s e-commerce ecosystem is booming How Indochino is suiting up for a massive retail expansion How Klothed helps online shoppers try clothes with their smartphone Like Us Follow @cdnbiz Subscribe with Texture Get our daily briefing on innovation, leadership, technology & the economy.

Chris Sununu's inaugural committee, each giving $25,000. They're among at least 40 businesses, law firms and energy and health care companies listed as contributors to the committee, which helps pay for inaugural celebrations. Sununu is hosting inaugural events Friday in Portsmouth, Saturday in Nashua and Jan. 21 at the Omni Mount Washington Hotel. He was sworn in Thursday as New Hampshire's 82nd governor. Energy companies Eversource and NextEra Energy Resources are two top donors. Eversource is a major utility in New Hampshire and is behind the Northern Pass transmission line project. Sununu supports the project, and Eversource executives contributed at least $19,000 to his campaign. NextEra operates the Seabrook Nuclear Station. The other top donors are law firm Gallagher, Callahan and Gartrell, which lobbied on behalf of dozens of clients at the Statehouse last year, and Centene, a company that contracts with the state to manage health care for Medicaid recipients for hundreds of millions of dollars. Sununu's predecessor, Democratic U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan, also paid for her inaugural activities with donations from Eversource and other businesses and law firms, including Gallagher, Callahan and Gartrell. "There is a long-standing tradition of leaders from the business community in New Hampshire who participate in inaugural celebrations, regardless of party," Sununu spokesman Dave Abrams said. Donors that gave $10,000 include national companies such as AT&T and Wal-Mart, as well as New Hampshire businesses such as Beer Distributors of New Hampshire and the utility company Unitil. Among the $5,000 donors are Sig Sauer, BAE, Anthem, Fairport, Elliot Health System and New Hampshire Motor Speedway. The League of New Hampshire Craftsmen donated $1,000. Sununu is required by law to file a full list of donors, including individuals, with the Secretary of State by March. Top Jobs Contemporary Chrysler • Jeep • Dodge Ram is hiring!!

 US STOCKS-S&P, Dow flat after jobs data; tech stocks lift Nasdaq Reuters Jan. 6, 2017, 11:28 AM 324 facebook linkedin twitter email print * 156,000 jobs added in December vs est. 178,000 * Unemployment rate rises to 4.7 pct; wages up 0.4 pct * Amgen top stock on S&P, Regeneron top loser * Indexes down: Dow 0.02 pct, S&P 0.07 pct, Nasdaq 0.39 pct (Adds details, comments, updates prices) By Yashaswini Swamynathan Jan 6 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were little changed on Friday after a mixed jobs report, while tech stocks lifted the Nasdaq to a record intraday high. The Nasdaq was on track to be the biggest gainer in Wall Street's first trading week of the year, rising about 2.2 percent. The S&P was set to gain 1.3 percent and the Dow 0.6 percent. A Labor Department report showed that the public and private sectors together added fewer-than-expected jobs last month but average hourly earnings ticked up, suggesting sustained momentum in the labor market. The report adds to a recent spate of robust economic data across sectors including manufacturing and automobiles. This, coupled with President-elect Donald Trump's fiscal stimulus proposals, could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster than anticipated. "It is a payrolls day so expect some choppy price action," said Justin Lederer, interest rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. "But overall, everyone is looking at the next administration to come in and to get further clarity on where interest rates might go." The minutes of the Federal Reserve's December meeting released on Wednesday showed that almost every Fed policymaker agreed Trump's measures could call for a faster move on rates. The central bank currently expects to raise rates thrice this year. The dollar rose to session highs against major currencies, while gold slipped. At 10:54 a.m. ET (1554 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 3.89 points, or 0.02 percent, at 19,903.18, the S&P 500 was up 1.67 points, or 0.07 percent, at 2,270.67 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 21.24 points, or 0.39 percent, at 5,509.17. Five of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower, led by the telecom services sector's 1.73 percent decline. Technology rose 0.4 percent, boosted by Apple . Wal-Mart fell 1.5 percent to $68.20 after the company said Rosalind Brewer, chief executive officer of its warehouse club stores Sam's Club, would retire from on Feb. 1. Amgen rose 3.3 percent, after a U.S. district judge blocked Sanofi and Regeneron from selling their cholesterol drug, which Amgen said infringed its patents. Regeneron was off 7 percent and was the biggest percentage loser on the S&P. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,673 to 1,081. On the Nasdaq, 1,435 issues fell and 1,140 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed 11 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 37 new highs and eight new lows.

Gaskin said he tries not to spend much time looking at responses to his posts. His solution: Block the worst offenders. (Vasha Hunt/AL.com via AP, File) Clemson linebacker Ben Boulware is the team's top tackler and a lightning rod for criticism on Twitter. Some of the tweets cuss him out, others he laughs off. But one was way out of line: His father had to contact the police after one person picked on Boulware's little sister. "Is it really that serious? You have to find my little sister and say something to her?" Boulware said. "It's football. Sorry that I ruined your day so much, that I tackled your quarterback too hard. It's ridiculous." The bigger the stage, the more fans talk about and taunt college players behind a Twitter handle. It's a fact of life circa 2017. Ben Boulware knows that well. It's a part of life as a college celebrity, and it means learning how to respond — or not respond — with the public watching every post. "I hear it every day. I don't care," Boulware said. "If they want to take five minutes out of their day and tweet at somebody you don't know, you're a loser. Go do something with your life. Talking negative about somebody, it's just so lame. Don't you have something better to do?" Is the best option to shut up? Snipe back? Engage with the fan? Go dark? Boulware's father, Jamie Boulware, contacted the Anderson County Sheriff's Office after daughter Bailee, a Clemson junior, received a threat. He was told it wasn't likely anything would come out of it. The Twitter fallout has lightened up since the Louisville game, Jamie Boulware said. He asked a couple of the offenders to visit him at the family tailgate so they could talk, but they didn't take him up on it. "It's a shame that these days people can say things like that without consequences," he said. All four playoff teams have stories about Twitter nastiness, and most players try to restrain themselves from firing back. Clemson has a no-social-media policy during the season, a plan voted on by the players. Alabama coach Nick Saban lets players know that what they say on social media is part of their "brand," for better or worse. "This is sort of something that we're constantly trying to address with players so that they can brand themselves in a positive way," Saban said. Former players can only marvel at what their successors have to deal with. Ex-Alabama quarterback Greg McElroy doesn't think he would have been mature enough to handle the starting job as a freshman like Jalen Hurts , partly because of social media critics. "I definitely couldn't have handled it as an 18-year-old, especially if I was an 18-year-old in 2016," said McElroy, now an analyst for the SEC Network. "It's only been six years since I finished, and the world's changed quite a bit in a very short period of time. It's a tall order for sure and it does take a remarkable amount of maturity." And restraint. Washington quarterback Jake Browning avoids some of the in-season attention, good or bad, by staying off Twitter. His last Tweet before the Huskies semifinal loss to Alabama came on Aug. 7: "Hello fall camp. Goodbye Twitter." Ohio State guard Billy Price says he "could get a false start and I get crucified on Twitter." He says that's just reality and there's nothing players can do but try to get better. It's also a splash of reality because they've gotten so much in-person praise during their careers. "That's the cold, hard truth of it," Price said. "Especially in this program, because the truth comes at you fast. It's hard, especially as a young guy when you're not ready for that. You've never been told you suck because you're in high school and you're around your hometown and people love you. "You go to Wal-Mart and people love you. You see the little old lady at church that loves you and you give her a hug and say, 'Hi, Mrs. Smith.' But once you come here, the truth comes out. You got beat, you lost. Just get better. That's what it comes down to." Then again, he didn't much appreciate people tweeting at his girlfriend that "your boyfriend's trash." Washington wide receiver Dante Pettis grew up seeing and hearing people criticize his father, Gary Pettis, a former major league outfielder who won five Gold Gloves and is now the Houston Astros' third base coach. He said there will always be people who "say bad stuff." "If that's what they think that's what they think," Dante Pettis said.

(Vasha Hunt/AL.com via AP, File) Clemson linebacker Ben Boulware is the team's top tackler and a lightning rod for criticism on Twitter. Some of the tweets cuss him out, others he laughs off. But one was way out of line: His father had to contact the police after one person picked on Boulware's little sister. "Is it really that serious? You have to find my little sister and say something to her?" Boulware said. "It's football. Sorry that I ruined your day so much, that I tackled your quarterback too hard. It's ridiculous." The bigger the stage, the more fans talk about and taunt college players behind a Twitter handle. It's a fact of life circa 2017. Ben Boulware knows that well. It's a part of life as a college celebrity, and it means learning how to respond — or not respond — with the public watching every post. "I hear it every day. I don't care," Boulware said. "If they want to take five minutes out of their day and tweet at somebody you don't know, you're a loser. Go do something with your life. Talking negative about somebody, it's just so lame. Don't you have something better to do?" Is the best option to shut up? Snipe back? Engage with the fan? Go dark? Boulware's father, Jamie Boulware, contacted the Anderson County Sheriff's Office after daughter Bailee, a Clemson junior, received a threat. He was told it wasn't likely anything would come out of it. The Twitter fallout has lightened up since the Louisville game, Jamie Boulware said. He asked a couple of the offenders to visit him at the family tailgate so they could talk, but they didn't take him up on it. "It's a shame that these days people can say things like that without consequences," he said. All four playoff teams have stories about Twitter nastiness, and most players try to restrain themselves from firing back. Clemson has a no-social-media policy during the season, a plan voted on by the players. Alabama coach Nick Saban lets players know that what they say on social media is part of their "brand," for better or worse. "This is sort of something that we're constantly trying to address with players so that they can brand themselves in a positive way," Saban said. Former players can only marvel at what their successors have to deal with. Ex-Alabama quarterback Greg McElroy doesn't think he would have been mature enough to handle the starting job as a freshman like Jalen Hurts , partly because of social media critics. "I definitely couldn't have handled it as an 18-year-old, especially if I was an 18-year-old in 2016," said McElroy, now an analyst for the SEC Network. "It's only been six years since I finished, and the world's changed quite a bit in a very short period of time. It's a tall order for sure and it does take a remarkable amount of maturity." And restraint. Washington quarterback Jake Browning avoids some of the in-season attention, good or bad, by staying off Twitter.

He asked a couple of the offenders to visit him at the family tailgate so they could talk, but they didn't take him up on it. "It's a shame that these days people can say things like that without consequences," he said. All four playoff teams have stories about Twitter nastiness, and most players try to restrain themselves from firing back. Clemson has a no-social-media policy during the season, a plan voted on by the players. Alabama coach Nick Saban lets players know that what they say on social media is part of their "brand," for better or worse.

Former players can only marvel at what their successors have to deal with. Ex-Alabama quarterback Greg McElroy doesn't think he would have been mature enough to handle the starting job as a freshman like Jalen Hurts , partly because of social media critics. "I definitely couldn't have handled it as an 18-year-old, especially if I was an 18-year-old in 2016," said McElroy, now an analyst for the SEC Network. "It's only been six years since I finished, and the world's changed quite a bit in a very short period of time. It's a tall order for sure and it does take a remarkable amount of maturity."

It's also a splash of reality because they've gotten so much in-person praise during their careers. "That's the cold, hard truth of it," Price said. "Especially in this program, because the truth comes at you fast. It's hard, especially as a young guy when you're not ready for that. You've never been told you suck because you're in high school and you're around your hometown and people love you. "You go to Wal-Mart and people love you. You see the little old lady at church that loves you and you give her a hug and say, 'Hi, Mrs. Smith.' But once you come here, the truth comes out. You got beat, you lost. Just get better. That's what it comes down to." Then again, he didn't much appreciate people tweeting at his girlfriend that "your boyfriend's trash." Washington wide receiver Dante Pettis grew up seeing and hearing people criticize his father, Gary Pettis, a former major league outfielder who won five Gold Gloves and is now the Houston Astros' third base coach. He said there will always be people who "say bad stuff." "If that's what they think that's what they think," Dante Pettis said. "Maybe they're jealous of where we are, maybe they wish they could be here. But at the end of the day we know what we're doing is good so that's all that matters." Alabama tailback Damien Harris, one of the Crimson Tide's more frequent posters, said one user once said he hoped he would break his leg and have a career-ending injury. He got some backlash in September after posting comments about a presidential debate , which later was a topic in his political communications class. "People were all like, 'Stick to football. You don't know what you're talking about,'" Harris said. "So I'm like, 'Since I play football, that means I can't be involved in something that affects me?' That stuff didn't make sense. Just like everything else, you read it and then you move on." Washington running back Myles Gaskin said he tries not to spend much time looking at responses to his posts. His solution: Block the worst offenders. "It's definitely part of the game," Gaskin said. "People are going to say what they've got to say but at the end of the day true fans of UW and anybody that supports this university, I feel like they'll only give us constructive criticism. They'll always have our backs. "Anybody that is out there saying mean stuff I know you've got something better to do. Don't bother me with it.

Playoff Teams Confront Twitter Pot Shots By john zenor, ap sports writer Jan 7, 2017, 4:00 AM ET 0 Shares Email Star 0 Shares Email Clemson linebacker Ben Boulware is the team's top tackler and a lightning rod for criticism on Twitter. Some of the tweets cuss him out, others he laughs off. But one was way out of line: His father had to contact the police after one person picked on Boulware's little sister. "Is it really that serious? You have to find my little sister and say something to her?" Boulware said. "It's football. Sorry that I ruined your day so much, that I tackled your quarterback too hard. It's ridiculous." The bigger the stage, the more fans talk about and taunt college players behind a Twitter handle. It's a fact of life circa 2017. Ben Boulware knows that well. It's a part of life as a college celebrity, and it means learning how to respond — or not respond — with the public watching every post. "I hear it every day. I don't care," Boulware said. "If they want to take five minutes out of their day and tweet at somebody you don't know, you're a loser. Go do something with your life. Talking negative about somebody, it's just so lame. Don't you have something better to do?" Is the best option to shut up? Snipe back? Engage with the fan? Go dark?

Ya Libnan Lebanon News and World News Live from Beirut Featured News Lebanon News World News Opinion Business News Arts & Culture Sci & Tech Video Solar Could Beat Coal to Be the Cheapest Power on Earth January 3, 2017 by yalibnan 2 Comments A solar farm in the Atacama desert, northern Chile. Photographer: Vladimir Rodas/AFP via Getty Images Solar power is now cheaper than coal in some parts of the world. In less than a decade, it’s likely to be the lowest-cost option almost everywhere. In 2016, countries from Chile to the United Arab Emirates broke records with deals to generate electricity from sunshine for less than 3 cents a kilowatt-hour, half the average global cost of coal power. Now, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Mexico are planning auctions and tenders for this year, aiming to drop prices even further. Taking advantage: Companies such as Italy’s Enel SpA and Dublin’s Mainstream Renewable Power, who gained experienced in Europe and now seek new markets abroad as subsidies dry up at home. Since 2009, solar prices are down 62 percent, with every part of the supply chain trimming costs. That’s help cut risk premiums on bank loans, and pushed manufacturing capacity to record levels. By 2025, solar may be cheaper than using coal on average globally, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. “These are game-changing numbers, and it’s becoming normal in more and more markets,” said Adnan Amin, International Renewable Energy Agency ’s director general, an Abu Dhabi-based intergovernmental group. “Every time you double capacity, you reduce the price by 20 percent.” Better technology has been key in boosting the industry, from the use of diamond-wire saws that more efficiently cut wafers to better cells that provide more spark from the same amount of sun. It’s also driven by economies of scale and manufacturing experience since the solar boom started more than a decade ago, giving the industry an increasing edge in the competition with fossil fuels. The average 1 megawatt-plus ground mounted solar system will cost 73 cents a watt by 2025 compared with $1.14 now, a 36 percent drop, said Jenny Chase, head of solar analysis for New Energy Finance. That’s in step with other forecasts. GTM Research expects some parts of the U.S. Southwest approaching $1 a watt today, and may drop as low as 75 cents in 2021, according to its analyst MJ Shiao. The U.S. Energy Department’s National Renewable Energy Lab expects costs of about $1.20 a watt now declining to $1 by 2020. By 2030, current technology will squeeze out most potential savings, said Donald Chung, a senior project leader. The International Energy Agency expects utility-scale generation costs to fall by another 25 percent on average in the next five years. The International Renewable Energy Agency anticipates a further drop of 43 percent to 65 percent for solar costs by 2025. That would bring to 84 percent the cumulative decline since 2009. The solar supply chain is experiencing “a Wal-Mart effect” from higher volumes and lower margins, according to Sami Khoreibi, founder and chief executive officer of Enviromena Power Systems, an Abu Dhabi-based developer. The speed at which the price of solar will drop below coal varies in each country. Places that import coal or tax polluters with a carbon price, such as Europe and Brazil, will see a crossover in the 2020s, if not before. Countries with large domestic coal reserves such as India and China will probably take longer. China, the biggest solar market, will see costs falling below coal by 2030, according to New Energy Finance. The country has surpassed Germany as the nation with the most installed solar capacity as the government seeks to increase use to cut carbon emissions and boost home consumption of clean energy. Yet curtailment remains a problem, particularly in sunnier parts of the country as congestion on the grid forces some solar plants to switch off. Sunbelt countries are leading the way in cutting costs, though there’s more to it than just the weather. The use of auctions to award power-purchase contracts is forcing energy companies to compete with each other to lower costs. An August auction in Chile yielded a contract for 2.91 cents a kilowatt-hour. In September, a United Arab Emirates auction grabbed headlines with a bid of 2.42 cents a kilowatt-hour. Developers have been emboldened to submit lower bids by expectations that the cost of the technology will continue to fall. “We’re seeing a new reality where solar is the lowest-cost source of energy, and I don’t see an end in sight in terms of the decline in costs,” said Enviromena’s Khoreibi. Bloomberg Filed Under: Business News Arzna Despite 300 days of sunshine Lebanese still live in the dark. Power Blackouts are a daily affair and no politician seems to care . With the cost of solar power going down to couple of cents per KWH it is time for Lebanon to think solar power in a big way. Some of the private companies in Lebanon are charging over 75 cents per KWH , ….think of the savings if we switch to solar 5thDrawer Some ‘folks’ have been listening to those of us who blogged on it a long time … Germany set examples … and techies worked at improvements.

(AP) - It was shaping up to be a pretty good Christmas. Priscilla Bejaran of Allentown had the week off, and planned to get a lot of errands done. But on Dec. 20, a Tuesday, she told her 10-year-old daughter, April, to get her two little brothers into the car, and April came back in the house and said the car wasn't there. Priscilla's first guess was that her husband, Kristian Jaquez, had taken it, but she called him and he said he had gone to work in his own car. She didn't need a second guess. The car had been stolen overnight from the family's South Fifth Street home. It wasn't a fancy car, by any means - a 1997 Honda Civic. It had 81,000 miles on it when she bought it from a neighbor last year. But Civics are reliable and sturdy and Priscilla was delighted to have it. She drove it to her job at Lehigh Valley Hospital-Cedar Crest and shuttled the children around. "I had saved up awhile," she said. "I thought 'Finally, I can get this car and we'll have a second vehicle to get around.'" "It was something just for her," Kristian said. "When it got stolen, she felt like part of her was missing." The car wasn't missing for long. That same morning, a North Catasauqua police officer named Christopher Wolfer came across the car on Front Street in the borough. "The doors were missing," Wolfer said. "All the bolts were on the ground. Inside the radio was hacked out." Wolfer had the car towed to the impound lot. A short time later, Priscilla and Kristian showed up at the police station, alerted by Allentown police that the car had been recovered. Wolfer was a bit irritated, because he hadn't even started the paperwork and now he had to tell this couple that their car was essentially a wreck. But the irritation faded right away. "I could just tell Priscilla was a pleasant, good person," he said. When he showed them a picture of the car, Priscilla broke down crying, explaining how hard she had worked to buy it and how much she depended on it. Everyone in the station house grew quiet, imagining what it must be like for a working couple with three children - the youngest of whom is autistic - to be victimized at Christmas that way. "I was talking to the chief afterward," Wolfer said. "I said 'They seemed like good people. I'm going to make some calls and see if I can get some doors for it.'" That might not have been too troublesome or costly. But Wolfer, who was a mechanic before he was a cop, popped the hood and looked in dismay at the engine. It had been damaged, too. He made a few calls to mechanics and concluded it would cost nearly $800 to fix the car, which was far beyond his means even if friends and co-workers chipped in. So he set up a campaign on GoFundMe, the charitable website, with a goal of $747. "There was no activity on it for an hour," Wolfer said. "I forgot about it and the next time I looked at it, there was $600 donated and hundreds of shares." What made this especially touching was that Wolfer recognized the names of some of the donors. They were, he knew, the kind of people who could least afford to part with their money, but here they were pledging $25, $50, $100 to help two strangers. "Sorry someone was so mean," wrote a woman who gave $10. "Hope this helps." In the end, the donations totaled $1,225. A Catasauqua mechanic, Justin Bowersox of Street Legal Automotive, donated labor. A&S Installations, an Allentown company, donated an alarm system. Wolfer took the leftover money to Wal-Mart two nights before Christmas and bought toys for the children. He had disclosed none of this to Priscilla and Kristian, of course. The plan was to give them a Christmas Eve they would always remember. Priscilla and Kristian, meanwhile, spent the week wondering when they would get the car back so they could figure out what to do with it. Priscilla would call Wolfer periodically and he would gently put her off. "He would tell me 'Oh, they have to fingerprint it,' or one little thing or another," she said. "I'm not a good liar," Wolfer confessed. Finally, on Christmas Eve, Wolfer told the couple to come to the station. When they arrived, he led them out the door and they beheld the car, good as new and, in a sense, even better than that. It took a few moments to realize what had happened - that strangers had entered their lives and restored what other strangers had taken away. "My car!" Priscilla exclaimed. She cried, and so did her husband. "Officer Wolfer is a blessing," Kristian said. "So many people have such a bad conception of police officers. But he's an amazing individual."

 US STOCKS-Wall St loses ground after mixed jobs data Reuters Jan. 6, 2017, 9:56 AM 91 facebook linkedin twitter email print * 156,000 jobs added in December vs est. 178,000 * Unemployment rate rises to 4.7 pct; wages up 0.4 pct * Amgen top stock on S&P, Regeneron top loser * Indexes down: Dow 0.25 pct, S&P 0.19 pct, Nasdaq 0.07 pct (Updates to open) By Yashaswini Swamynathan Jan 6 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged lower on Friday after data showed employment in December rose less than expected but a rebound in wages suggested sustained growth in the labor market. The public and private sectors together added 156,000 jobs last month, a U.S. Labor Department report showed, compared with 204,000 jobs added in November. Average hourly earnings increased 10 cents, or 0.4 percent, after slipping 0.1 percent in November. That pushed the year-on-year increase in average hourly earnings to 2.9 percent, the largest increase since June 2009. Unemployment rate ticked up to 4.7 percent. The report adds to a recent spate of robust economic data across sectors including manufacturing and automobiles. This, coupled with President-elect Donald Trump's pledge for fiscal stimulus, could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster than anticipated. "Wage growth is firming up and if we get over 3.0 percent, the Fed would feel a lot more comfortable to raise rates further," said Craig Dismuke, chief economist at Vining Sparks in Memphis, Tennessee. The minutes of the Federal Reserve's December meeting released on Wednesday showed that almost every Fed policymaker agreed Trump's measures could call for a faster move on rates. The central bank currently expects to raise rates thrice this year. The dollar rose to session highs against major currencies, while gold slipped. At 9:38 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 50.45 points, or 0.25 percent, at 19,848.84, the S&P 500 was down 4.31 points, or 0.19 percent, at 2,264.69 and the Nasdaq Composite index was down 3.73 points, or 0.07 percent, at 5,484.21. Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower, with telecom services losing the most by 2.11 percent. Financials gained 0.1 percent, while healthcare was flat. Wal-Mart fell 1.2 percent at $68.41 after the company said Rosalind Brewer, chief executive officer of its warehouse club stores Sam's Club, would retire from on Feb. 1. Amgen gave the biggest boost to the S&P, rising 4.9 percent, after a U.S. district judge blocked Sanofi and Regeneron from selling their cholesterol drug, which Amgen said infringed its patents. Regeneron was off 5.3 percent and was the index's biggest percentage loser. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,645 to 919. On the Nasdaq, 1,279 issues fell and 964 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed five new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 21 new highs and five new lows.

Photo by Angela Lewis /Times Free Press. The site of one of downtown Chattanooga's oldest businesses has been sold for $1.6 million, but Buehler's Market plans to continue to operate at the location, the store's owner says. Buehler's owner Charles Morton said that despite his sale of the property, the grocery store that has continuously operated at 429 Market St. since 1965 won't change. "It's business as usual," he said about the store that caters to many low-income patrons in the downtown area and dates back 105 years in the city. Morton, 70, who has owned the business since 1988, wouldn't reveal the buyer of the property, which is only identified in a real estate transaction as 429 Market Gp. "It has been my life for 52 years," he said about the store that runs out of a one-story, 6,369-square-foot brick building next to the popular Jack's Alley complex. Kim White, who heads the downtown nonprofit redevelopment group River City Co., said that small, central city markets such as Buehler's are rare anywhere these days. "He provides a great service," White said about Morton's business. "People take buses to come to his market." Still, White said, River City Co. is pursuing a full-service grocery store for downtown south of the Tennessee River. "As downtown's population is changing, there's an opportunity for a lot of different kinds of service," she said. "A grocery store with a grab and go component would do very well." Morton said his clientele consists of many older customers who still cook at home, while a lot of the younger people moving into new downtown apartments don't. "We have a loyal clientele that keeps us in business," he said. "People who move [downtown] don't shop here. They don't do a lot of cooking. They eat out a lot." Morton, who started at the business as "a sack boy," said his patrons feel comfortable shopping in the grocery store. "They've got to have a store to shop at," he said, adding that "I don't go to Wal-Mart. I'm not a big fan." The owner said Buehler's is a simple business, but it takes hard work. A warehouse operator out of Alabama that supplies many independent grocers provides much of Buehler's inventory, Morton said. "That keeps us competitive," he said, noting the store provides "good service" and employs more than 20 people. Morton said that when he feels he's finished running the business, he may turn it over to a longtime employee of the store. "She knows about everything I do," he said. Buehler's was part of an 18-store chain going back to early last century, according to a Chattanooga documentary done three years ago by Monika Groppe. Headquartered in Illinois, the chain operated mostly in the South and Midwest. Contact Mike Pare at mpare@timesfreepress.com or 423-757-6318.

Dannel P. Malloy wants more concessions. While Malloy has the hammer of more potential layoffs in addition to the more than 1,000 state employees terminated last year, union leaders this year will again push for higher taxes on the state’s wealthiest, a tactic that failed last year. Malloy, whose labor team has been involved in on-again, off-again negotiations with the State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition, wants to again use public employee unions as part of an attempt at long-term fiscal stability that can give business the predictability and stability they need for planning. Joe Brennan, president and chief executive officer of the Connecticut Business & Industry Association, said he was heartened by Malloy’s road map last week, when the second-term Democrat asked lawmakers to slash spending, and called for labor concessions and major changes to the way the state supports public education. “The governor’s top priorities resonate well in the business community,” Brennan said in a statement. “First, reduce budget deficits by making state government more productive and efficient. Second, make state employee wages and benefits more affordable for taxpayers. We believe this, along with leaning government, are important steps in closing budget gaps while maintaining essential services and avoiding further harmful tax increases.” Business and labor But Jennifer Schneider, spokesperson for SEIU Local 1199, which represents about 26,000 health care workers, said the employees are important members of their communities. “One of the main priorities of this legislative session needs to be how we can provide core services for our state while producing quality middle-class jobs,” she said. “A third of our state’s $1.5 billion budget deficit is spent on low-wage workers accessing public assistance. By raising the minimum wage to $15 and holding large corporations like Wal-Mart and McDonald’s accountable, we can be begin to make meaningful change in our state and in workers’ lives.” Last year, a bill that would have penalized big-box retailers and chain restaurants failed. Sal Luciano, executive director of 35,000-member AFSCME Council 4, said Malloy’s speech “may give some the impression that the governor expects a small minority of the population to resolve Connecticut’s fiscal challenges. The reality is that the scope of the problems facing us all requires a broader, far more comprehensive approach.” He said that SEBAC unions are already providing $1 billion a year in savings, under the 2011 agreement with Malloy. “Over the past eight years they have ratified two separate agreements to sacrifice wages and benefits in exchange for protecting the vital services they provide for residents,” Luciano said. “If millionaires and billionaires contributed a percentage of their income in taxes equivalent to that which working families already pay, lawmakers would have a $1 billion surplus at their disposal.” No appetite for concessions Lori Pelletier, president of the state AFL-CIO, said last week that she spoke with the governor before his speech, and while a “conversation” on pensions is ongoing between unions and Malloy, the talks are not substantial. “There is not an appetite for it,” Pelletier told reporters. “They see the concessions they voted for in 2011 and there has been no flattening of the management structure. I don’t know what his reasoning is.” She said that between union givebacks and cuts in town and city aid, unionized workers could get penalized twice. But House Minority Leader Themis Klarides, R-Derby, said a new audit shows Connecticut has the most under-funded pension plan in the nation at 35.5 percent, and that worker benefits must be scaled back. Republicans want measures including and end the use of overtime in calculating pension benefits, a new defined-contribution plan for new hires that limits the state’s contribution to 4 percent, an increase in worker contributions to 6 percent of salaries and a three-year wage freeze. “The valuation of state employee pensions has hit an all-time low, and the unfunded liability grows every day,” Klarides said. “This is not a question of the state putting more money into the account; we must overhaul the entire system before it goes broke.’’ kdixon@ctpost.com Today's Deals Powered by SHOP NOW Air Hogs Star Wars RC Advanced TIE Fighter for $33 + pickup at...

Police were alerted to the abduction about 9:35 a.m. by the principal at Sellers Elementary School at 500 N. Loraine Ave. “The mother, Breanna Shiree Arsenault … was seen by staff dragging her 5-year-old child away to an awaiting vehicle,” according to Glendora police Detective Chris Farino. The principal noted the license plate and called police, Farino said. The child's father has sole custody of the 5-year-old and Arsenault, 31, has supervised visitation “due to several prior narcotics-related arrests,” he said. Detectives learned Arsenault and the child switched vehicles in La Verne. They tracked her to a Walmart store on Technology Drive in Irvine and took her into custody, Farino said. The child was found “safe and unharmed,” he said. “Detectives are still investigating and are reuniting the child with her father,” Farino said. Arsenault was booked at the Glendora Police Department jail on suspicion of child stealing.

Sean Williams (TMFUltraLong) Jan 8, 2017 at 9:12AM Image source: Getty Images. Marijuana had an incredible 2016, and the fast-growing pot industry is looking to continue building on that momentum in 2017. After beginning 2016 with cannabis legal in 23 states for medical purposes, and four states for adult use, the year closed with 28 states having legalized medical marijuana and residents in eight states having legalized recreational weed. Most notably, legislatures in Pennsylvania and Ohio passed medical marijuana laws without bringing votes to the people, while residents in California overwhelmingly passed Prop 64 (recreational legalization), which could add $1 billion, or more, in annual tax and licensing revenue to the state. The dollar figures surrounding the legal pot industry are truly mind-blowing. Cannabis research firm ArcView has predicted that legal marijuana sales could grow by 30% annually through the remainder of this decade, while investment firm Cowen & Co. went a step further and forecast legal sales growth from $6 billion to $50 billion over the next decade, or more than a 23% compound annual return per year. Safety continues to be a priority for regulators However, even these dollar figures aren't enough to sway the federal government, which maintain's the drug's schedule 1 status. As a schedule 1 drug, marijuana is deemed illegal and defined as not having any medically beneficial qualities. In August, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency denied petitions that requested the rescheduling or de-scheduling of cannabis. Image source: Office of Public Affairs, Flickr. Safety remains the primary reason why the DEA and lawmakers on Capitol Hill have held off on rescheduling marijuana for medical purposes. Aside from a lack of approved clinical trial data -- the Food and Drug Administration hasn't exactly been forthcoming with trials designed to test the medical capabilities of cannabis -- regulators have been concerned with the possibility of pot falling into the hands of adolescents, or what might happen if an impaired individual gets behind the wheel of a vehicle. For example, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Al.), Donald Trump's appointee for U.S. Attorney General, stated in a Senate drug hearing this past April that there's been a 20% increase in traffic-related deaths caused by marijuana in select states. As an ardent opponent of marijuana's expansion, demonstrating the safety of pot could prove difficult. But what if Sessions has it all wrong? Shocking new findings suggest this worry could be overstated According to a new study published online in the American Journal of Public Health in November by a team of nine researchers, a surprising trend emerged in medical marijuana legal states. After the team of researchers reviewed U.S. traffic fatalities between 1985 and 2014 using the Fatality Analysis Reporting System, the data showed that, on average, medical marijuana legal states had lower traffic fatality rates than non-medical marijuana legal states. This paralleled a 2013 study from three researchers that was published in the Journal of Law and Economics, which showed an 8% to 11% decline in traffic fatalities in the year immediately following the legalization of marijuana. Image source: Oregon Department of Transportation, Flickr. As stated in the abstract of the recently released study published in AJPH, "Medical marijuana laws were associated with immediate reductions in traffic fatalities in those aged 15 to 24 and 25 to 44 years, and with additional yearly gradual reductions in those aged 25 to 44 years. However, state-specific results showed that only seven states experienced post-MML (medical marijuana legal) reductions. Dispensaries were also associated with traffic fatality reductions in those aged 25 to 44 years."  For instance, both California and New Mexico saw their traffic deaths fall by 16% and 17%, respectively, immediately following the passage of medical marijuana laws in the states. However, traffic deaths have gradually increased since this immediate drop. It's also important to note that researchers are pretty clear on two things. First, marijuana does indeed impair drivers, but certain hypotheses suggest that marijuana users may be more "aware" of their impairment than drivers who've consumed too much alcohol. Another possibility is simply that drivers have completely substituted marijuana for alcohol and stayed off the roads. Secondly, researchers are crystal clear that while the data demonstrates an association between medical marijuana legal states and reduced traffic deaths, it can't prove cause and effect. Further studies with more defined variables would be needed to do that.  Still much to be done Perhaps the biggest hurdle standing in the way of defining pot's safety as it pertains to driving is a way to measure how much of an impact it has on a driver's ability to react and make decisions. With alcohol there's a pretty simple line in the sand: if you're above a blood-alcohol content of 0.08%, you're considered legally impaired. There is no such scale for measuring how impaired a driver is who's used marijuana, and determining this scale could take countless studies and years to develop. Image source: Getty Images. Making matters more difficult, THC, the psychoactive component of marijuana, can stay in an individual's system for many days after use, whereas alcohol metabolizes through the body much faster. This can make it doubly difficult for conventional tests to determine impairment levels. This isn't to say there aren't a handful of companies pushing the envelope of innovation. Both Hound Labs and Cannabix Technologies are testing their versions of marijuana breathalyzers that they believe could make law enforcement's job a lot easier. But once again, without a concrete scale to determine what level of impairment is unacceptable, these technologies could struggle to find buyers. Long story short, there's still a lot left to be done in demonstrating to lawmakers on Capitol Hill that marijuana use won't lead to a catastrophe on the roadways if legalized nationally. This uncertainty, along with a number of inherent disadvantages faced by cannabis businesses, is exactly why investors should be monitoring pot's progress from the safety of the sidelines.

The Bonneau du Martray vineyard "shares the same philosophy as ours in California, based on the quality of the land and the wines," said his manager, Armand de Maigret. "We are winemakers, not a marketing machine." A point well taken by Louis-Fabrice Latour, head of Burgundy's wine federation BIVB, who says he is "reassured" by Kroenke's status as a wine professional who makes some of the world's most expensive wine. "He will respect the Burgundy tradition," Latour said. The sporting empire of Kroenke, 69, also includes gridiron team the Los Angeles Rams and basketball's Denver Nuggets and his fortune was estimated at US$7.7 billion by Forbes magazine last year. 'Californian tricks' De Maigret said Kroenke's team would "maintain the domain while adding a few Californian tricks and transferring some Burgundy tricks to California." Kroenke bought an 80-percent share in the Bonneau du Martray vineyard, which has been run by the same family for nearly 200 years, for an undisclosed sum. De Maigret earlier told the French financial newspaper Les Echos that Kroenke's first foreign acquisition in the wine-making world was "the product of love at first sight." Located near the picture-postcard town of Pernand-Vergelesses, the vineyard produces two highly regarded grand crus: a white wine, Corton Charlemagne, and a red, Corton. Both are mostly for export. Its vines are spread over 11 hectares on the prestigious Corton hill near Beaune. Kroenke bought the vineyard from four brothers, all in their 60s and none of whose offspring were interested in taking on the business. With no heirs to pass the property on to, they contacted 10 potential buyers around the world. The best offer came from Kroenke, who is married to Wal-Mart heiress Ann Walton Kroenke and also owns vineyards in Napa Valley in California, where he produces the cabernet sauvignon Screaming Eagle. In 1995, wine guru Robert Parker awarded the 1992 vintage of Screaming Eagle a near-perfect 99 points.

AP Photo/John Minchillo By MICHAEL SMERCONISH / Contributing Columnist Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Christopher James wears a "Make America Great Again" cap as he waits on line with others before the arrival of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump ahead of a campaign stop, Friday, Jan. 29, 2016, at the Radisson Hotel in Nashua, N.H. AP Photo/John Minchillo I made two New Year’s resolutions: one personal, one professional. The personal is “patience.” I’m forever trying to lengthen my fuse. Hopefully this will be the year. Professionally, my goal is to be better grounded. I’m feeling a disconnect to just under half the nation. My failure to see Donald Trump’s ascension was compelling evidence of my being out of touch with 46 percent of the country. I attribute that to my living in a virtual gated community defined by a number of factors, including: my ZIP code (No. 189 in the nation for home value, according to Forbes); my Penn Law graduate degree; my political registration as nonaffiliated; where our kids go to school; the car I drive; my weight consciousness; and even the TV I watch (loved “The Crown,” “Duck Dynasty” not so much). Even my Christmas lights — white LEDs — not the fat colored bulbs of my youth. And while I’m well read from sources across the spectrum, I admit that I’m quick to discount many due to their origin. My bubble is a world much different than my grandparents’ roots or the environment in which my parents raised my brother and me. Our family are Pennsylvania coal crackers who came from Eastern Europe with nothing. I grew up in a quarter-acre lot, three-bedroom house, which had no shower until I was in the eighth grade. That bathroom renovation was performed by an inmate on work release from the Bucks County Prison, where my father, a guidance counselor by day, ran the adult education program. My mom stayed at home, then worked as a secretary, and, when I was in high school, hit pay dirt as a hard-working Realtor. I won’t tell you her age, but she still works, long past the point where she needs to. Charles Murray was prescient five years ago when he wrote of the isolation of the new upper class and the negative consequences that flow when they are segregated from the working class. In his book “Coming Apart: The State of White America 1960-2010,” Murray included a quiz that was designed to show people like me just how isolated they’d become. His questions were no-brainers, he argued, for ordinary Americans: Have you ever walked on a factory floor? Who is Jimmie Johnson? Have you or your spouse ever bought a pickup truck? Since leaving school, have you ever worn a uniform? Have you ever watched an episode of “Oprah,” “Dr. Phil” or “Judge Judy” all the way through? I scored a 42, where 77 is a typical mark for a lifelong resident of a working-class neighborhood. Still, I didn’t appreciate the political significance of Murray’s work until this election, a point driven home during Christmas break when I shared breakfast with a near nonagenarian in southwest Florida. The meal became an exercise in field research. We were at a diner on Route 41, the Tamiami Trail in Collier County. Collier had the highest percentage of registered voters (87) cast ballots in the state. Trump won Collier by about 45,000 votes en route to a critical Florida victory. The diner was as red as the county. I’d stepped out of my bubble and into another. There were about 40 of us having breakfast, mostly male, all white, save an African American father and son, the former of which sported a county EMT uniform. The décor was accentuated by the grill of a 1957 Chevy coming out of the wall. Marilyn Monroe’s portrait hangs on the wall. So, too, numerous recognitions from the local newspaper praising the food. Not surprisingly, Fox News was playing on the largest of several TVs. This was what President Obama was talking about in a November Rolling Stone interview when he partly attributed Democratic losses to “Fox News in every bar and restaurant in big chunks of the country ....” My dining companion had sausage and biscuits; me, scrambled eggs. “Trump is the only shot we have of turning this around,” he told me, never quite defining what “this” is. That day’s main headline concerned President Obama evicting 35 Russian diplomats from the United States as a result of the presumed hack of our recent election. “Isn’t that a serious issue?” I asked. “Who knows if it was the Russians, how can we be sure that’s true?” said my guest. “Besides, we shouldn’t alienate the Russians,” he added. “They’re the only ones we can rely on to straighten out this situation with the Arabs. Maybe Trump can get the Chinese to help. It’s time to get this over with.” I sought counsel last week from J.D. Vance, author of the best-seller “Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis.” He told me he sees the nation’s divide as follows: “These two separate communities: They go to different schools, they eat at different restaurants, they watch different TV shows, they send their kids to play at different sports even. And eventually I think that separation is starting to infect our culture and our politics. “It really worries me that so few people even understand why someone would vote for Donald Trump.” Vance advises that people seeking a better understanding make it a point to interact with folks of a different social class, which can be a challenge today in comparison with 50 years ago when there was more mixing in the military, workplace, home and at church. So look for me taking more meals at Cracker Barrel, shopping at Walmart or even lingering in the parking lot at Lincoln Financial Field instead of sidestepping tailgaters. In 2017, I’m out to burst my bubble. Michael Smerconish can be heard from 9 a.m. to noon on SiriusXM’s POTUS Channel 124 and seen hosting “Smerconish” at 9 a.m. Saturdays on CNN.

SHARE You Said It, Jan. 8, 2017 By Staff Saturday, January 7, 2017 There goes the neighborhood. Palisade’s new Cameo shooting range in De Beque Canyon will be located just downriver from Island Acres State Park. While “organizers hope to attract 50,000 visitors a year” — shooting a formidable array of weapons — it’s pertinent to wonder how the many state park campers and other visitors will react to the incessant gunfire racket reverberating off the canyon walls. As for myself, I’ve often enjoyed walking with my dog and the good fishing at Island Acres. And what about the pair of bald eagles getting ready to nest just around the river bend up from the firing range? Contrary to apparent popular belief around here, the sound of gunfire isn’t music to everyone’s ears. I would like to thank the person who paid for my meal at IHOP on Christmas Day at 11 a.m. I will pay it forward and help someone else. I was alone again on Christmas. Your kindness made my day.     Trump’s promise to relax regulations on drilling on federal land won’t be putting energy workers back to work. Regulations have nothing to do with this energy bust. Commodity boom and busts are driven by supply and demand (i.e. price), not regulations. An energy-reliant Mesa County should know better by now. I’m sending my sincere appreciation and thanks to the talented instructors and organizers of the innovative senior learning program, New Dimensions. Both my husband and I have thoroughly enjoyed the variety of classes we have taken since the program’s inception in 2015. We are looking forward to the next term.   The Board of Education is thinking about a tax increase. Often, when reading stories related to District 51, I find myself baffled by some of the titles referenced. There does seem to be a lot of executive directors. I would like to see a table of organization with brief job explanations so that we can determine if this is an effectively managed, right-sized organization before we put a lot more money into it.   Is there no one who can fix the streetlights on Redlands Parkway? How about a consultant from Montrose? Theirs are working.   A big note of thanks to the construction crews and flaggers who worked on Highway 340. It took months of working on sidewalks, some widening and paving, turn lanes, bike lanes, etc. But it is now much safer and a pleasure to drive on. Also, Highway 50 on Orchard Mesa and over the Fifth Street bridge is a big improvement. Thanks again.   Wow, what an amazing Christmas light display on Partridge Court. I know it took many manpower hours to put together for all of us to enjoy this holiday season. It certainly brightens all our hearts to see what you have shared with us. Thank you so much. This guy has done an awesome job for many years now and I want to tell him how much we all appreciate his sharing. If you haven’t been by this display at night, you have missed out. Go see it.   To Marvin, who helped me and my dogs when we had car trouble on Dec. 28, thank you. If anybody knows Marvin, could you please ask him to look in his truck for my lost wallet? Has my dad’s WWII dog tag attached.   I have been reading The Daily Sentinel for over 20 years and have enjoyed the progression from small-town newspaper to award-winning journalism. There is one thing that has always bothered me and I finally have to comment. In the Dec. 30 paper on page 3A, there is yet another picture of a young person riding a bike (this one upside down) without a helmet. Please support wearing helmets.   Since this seems to be the place to thank people who have bought someone a meal, although I wasn’t myself a recipient, I wish to thank Wienerschnitzel and the VFW for providing meals to those in need on Christmas Day. Numerous organizations feed those who are less fortunate during the holidays right up through Christmas Eve, and we should all be grateful they do, but it is quite different for an organization to open their doors on Christmas Day itself. I’m impressed, since that to me is a reflection of the true spirit of Christmas: To give up some of your time on such a holiday and spend it helping others. May God bless you.   Why can’t dog owners be responsible? Many don’t clean up the poop after their dogs. In the Brookwillow subdivision, there is so much dog doo-doo around that I’m surprised the children playing in the green areas don’t track it into their homes. Keep it in your own enclosed area. If you don’t want to clean up after your dog, you don’t deserve to be a dog owner. Simple as that.   Leaving Walmart the other day, I spotted a ticket under my windshield wiper. I thought, “Now what have I done?” Some kind soul had written “Thank you for your service to our country” when they noticed our Purple Heart license plate. Made my day.   To those of you who are still struggling with the closure of the Life Center pool, don’t forget about the Orchard Mesa pool. Contrary to public opinion, the water temperature is 84 degrees, the surroundings are lovely, aerobic classes are uncrowded, lap lanes are always available in the morning and at lunch time. There is a hot tub, lifeguards are on duty, the locker rooms are clean and the rates are good, especially if you are over 65. Also, you will be supporting our city.

Published 1 week ago Despite having good intentions, when an ambitious creative effort falls a bit short execution-wise, the Internet can be a pretty unforgiving (and hilarious) place. BuzzFeed today (Jan. 7) debuted a new video ode to Beyoncé, highlighting on the singer's various looks and style moments throughout the years. While such content typically goes over very well with audiences, the website's execution recreating the looks fell short, resulting in people going off in the comments section. The video has already been viewed almost half a million times on Facebook, with many pointing out what BuzzFeed could have done differently, such as choosing a model perhaps better suited to pay homage to someone like Queen Bey. While Beyoncé's likeness and mannerisms are very difficult to duplicate while doing the iconic singer justice, many are outraged by how far the effort missed the mark this time around. As many are pointing out in the comments section, the model doesn't appear to rise to the occasion of portraying Beyoncé as well as the site had hoped, with one comment referring to the model as "extremely sloppy" while another points out, "at least for her she felt like Beyoncé for a day, the rest of us, not so convinced, lol." Another focal point of criticism lies in the wigs used in the video, with many pointing out that the lace was visible in one of the lace front wigs and that the quality of the wigs was overall extremely poor. "What kind of Walmart great value brand is this s**t?" one Facebook user reacted, while another weighed in, "I think Beyoncé would be ashamed if she seen this." Yikes. Take a look at the video in question and some reactions in the posts below.

MUST WATCH Bursting my bubble 03:39 Story highlights Michael Smerconish says his New Year's resolution is to get back in touch with working-class America The CNN host, who comes from humble roots, confessed that over time had "unintentionally self-sorted" (CNN)CNN's Michael Smerconish announced Saturday that his New Year's resolution was to "burst my bubble." Despite hailing from humble beginnings in Pennsylvania, the CNN host confessed that over time, he had "unintentionally self-sorted." Now, he announced, it was time for him to check his own privilege, a desire sparked after failing a quiz in Charles Murray's 2012 book "Coming Apart." The quiz consists of everyday questions such as "Have you ever walked on a factory floor?" "Who is Jimmie Johnson?" and "Have you or your spouse ever bought a pickup truck?" An average working-class American scores 77. Smerconish, he confessed, had scored just 44. "My poor results should have prepared me for the disconnect that I felt watching Donald Trump's ascension to the presidency, compelling evidence of my being out of touch with 46% of the nation," Smerconish said. Read More "Mine is a virtual gated community, defined by things like my zip code, or where our kids go to school, my graduate law degree, my political registration as a non-affiliate, my health consciousness." He added: "I'm more into 'The Crown' than 'Duck Dynasty.' " It's a bubble, Smerconish emphasized, that's at odds with his roots as the "grandson of Pennsylvania coal crackers." As a child, he said, his home didn't have a shower until he was in eighth grade, and his first job, when he was 16, was as a maintenance man at McDonald's. So this year, he insisted, he intends to be "better grounded." "I have resolved to keep an open ear and be a better listener," Smerconish insisted. "You can look for me at Cracker Barrel, shopping at Walmart, driving my F-150 more and my sedan less, maybe even lingering in the parking lot at Eagles home games instead of side-stepping all those tailgaters," he said. "In 2017, I am out to burst my bubble," he concluded. Content by LendingTree Rates now at 3.2% APR (15 Yr Fixed). Do you qualify?

SpaceX Figures Out Why Its Rocket Blew Up newsfeedback@fool.com (Rich Smith) Jan 7, 2017 2 Four months after a SpaceX rocket exploded on its launch pad in Florida, the pioneering, privately owned space company is ready to return to space. If all goes well Sunday, we could soon see SpaceX resume regularly tweeting out images like this one -- of rockets making sonic booms, instead of rockets simply going "boom." Image source: SpaceX. That's the short version of SpaceX's latest "anomaly update," posted on its website on Monday. After four months investigating an accident that Elon Musk called "the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in 14 years," SpaceX is more or less convinced it's figured out (1) what went wrong, and (2) how to prevent it from going wrong again, and is now ready to launch again -- tomorrow. Now here's the long version: What went wrong Within the second stage of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket are a series of three aluminum vessels containing super-chilled liquid helium inside a main tank that holds the rocket's liquid oxygen for combustion. The purpose of these vessels is to release helium to replace oxygen from the fuel tank as it is consumed, maintaining pressure within the fuel tank. Each of these three vessels is shrink-wrapped with carbon composite on the outside. The problem is, this "wrap" sometimes develops tiny wrinkles between it and the aluminum lining, into which oxygen can seep and pool. SpaceX believes that its anomaly was caused by the helium in the vessels being pumped in too cold, freezing oxygen trapped in one of these pools and turning the oxygen into a solid. This solid oxygen then somehow reacted with the composite exterior -- either by expanding and bursting the composite wrap, or perhaps igniting a spark through friction -- puncturing the vessel and igniting the fireball. Now, there were no cameras within the Falcon 9 to observe the explosion as it happened, and the entire process took only 93 milliseconds start to finish, which makes it difficult for SpaceX to know exactly how the failure took place. But SpaceX has narrowed down its analysis to the point where the company is all but certain that something like what has been described above is what actually happened. Furthermore, SpaceX is sufficiently sure of this that it believes if it can prevent its oxygen from freezing again it can prevent another explosion from occurring in future launches. How to fix it SpaceX has two plans for preventing such anomalies from occurring in the future. Near-term, the fix involves pumping helium into the fuel tank vessels at warmer temperatures to prevent the helium from freezing oxygen trapped in any wrinkles in the overwrap. Longer term, SpaceX will implement manufacturing changes to prevent wrinkles from occurring in the first place. That should eliminate the possibility of oxygen pools forming -- and permit SpaceX to resume loading helium at lower temperatures, accelerating the fueling process. What comes next SpaceX hasn't said how long it will take to implement its long-term fix. The short-term fix, on the other hand, can be implemented immediately. In fact, if all goes well, we should see it implemented in the Sunday launch of 10 Iridium (NASDAQ: IRDM) NEXT communications satellites departing Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. What it means for investors After several months' hiatus, SpaceX today is in a precarious state -- no longer profitable or cash-flow positive, and with a launch manifest brimming with impatient customers, some of which have already begun jumping ship to fly with SpaceX's competitors. According to SpaceX, the company has 70 customers signed up to launch rockets, including 42 named missions on its manifest. Among other missions, SpaceX hopes this year to launch its Falcon Heavy lift rocket for the first time ever, to reuse a previously launched-and-recovered Falcon 9 (also for the first time ever), and maybe even to run an unmanned Crew Dragon test flight (yet another first). In addition to the headline-making potential of such "first" missions, the faster SpaceX returns to business, the faster it can begin billing those customers -- at $62 million a pop and more. And the faster it can resume billing, the faster it will return its balance sheet to health. And on the flip side? If SpaceX suffers another failure Sunday, or is forced to delay launch, the balance sheet will deteriorate further, Iridium's satellites will spend more time stuck on Earth where they cannot generate revenue for that company, and SpaceX's other customers will have more time to wonder: Keep up with money news, sent to your inbox Sign Up!

The week of Dec. 18-24, the hospital saw one case of flu and the week prior to that, there were three cases. Last week, there were 10 reported cases, three of which caused patients to be admitted to the hospital for complications, according to officials. The hospital’s reported flu cases for this week were unavailable at press time. “We’ve been waiting for flu season to start, and it looks like it has begun,” said Dana Benton, the hospital’s director of community and public relations. “We do encourage people to get the flu shot if they haven’t.” According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, flu season peaks December through February, and activity generally lasts through May. Dr. Jaya Kumar, medical director at Medical City Denton, said the upward trend in flu activity at the hospital aligns with the national uptick. Three people were admitted to the hospital recently after experiencing flu complications including dehydration, pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The flu is a contagious respiratory illness that includes symptoms such as fever, cough, runny or stuffy nose, body aches and fatigue. If serious enough, it could lead to hospitalization or death. Kumar stresses the flu vaccine as the main preventive measure. After getting the shot, it generally takes two weeks for the body to build immunity to flu viruses. She also recommends people cover their cough, stay away from people who are sick, and practice good hand washing. If sick with the flu yourself, Kumar suggests wearing a face mask to help limit the spread of germs. Denton County Public Health keeps statistics on flu cases, but officials there could not be reached for comment Friday. In a statement last month, Juan Rodriguez, the county’s chief epidemiologist, said “early indications show this year’s vaccine to be a good match to the strains we have already seen circulating.” Flu shots can be obtained at physicians’ offices and pharmacies, including CVS, Walgreens, Wal-Mart, Albertsons and Kroger. Locations offering flu shots can be found by visiting http://vaccinefinder.org. Free vaccines may also still be in supply at Denton County Public Health clinics for eligible residents.

Submitted photo Members of the YMCA and children attending Park and Play play games in the park last summer. In December, the Child Hunger Coalition of Klamath County was nationally recognized by the U.S. Department of Agriculture with the 2016 Western Region Summer Sunshine Award for their continued efforts to end child hunger and food insecurity in the county. For the past two years, the YMCA has teamed up with Integral Youth Services, the city parks system and the health department, among others, to share their resources and host “Park & Play,” a summer program that ensures children have access to at least one meal a day during the summer school break, YMCA Program Development Director Renea Wood said. “Our community is in really high need when it comes to child hunger,” Wood said. Story continues below video × Between 50 and 90 percent of students in Klamath County use the Free and Reduced Lunch Program during school, Wood said, which provides them with breakfast, lunch and for some, a snack after school. The program stops during the summer, however, and children wonder where their next meal is coming from. Meals, activities Park and Play combines free meals and activities, catering to all children up to the age of 18 and their families, including those who are unable to provide three meals a day during the summer, Wood said. “It’s more than just a free lunch with the stigma on only feeding kids in poverty,” she said. “It’s all about trying to get the community, kids and their families together every day during the summer to learn about nutrition and be mentored by role models.” For 11 weeks during the summer, around 100 staff, volunteers and guests work in five parks across the city, including Stukel, Etna and Mills-Kiwanis, to feed, educate and mentor the children for an hour everyday. Last summer the program served just under 900 kids almost 12,500 meals, Wood said. Program Coordinator for the Regional Health Equity Coalition in Klamath County Valeree Lane organized volunteers for various events at Park and Play last summer and saw noticeable changes among the children who attended the program regularly, she said. More than lunch They built relationships with the staff and volunteers, which Lane said enhanced their awareness and education of the environment, health and food types, among other things, and they were exposed to more opportunities than simply having lunch. “They need the right nutrients in their body and the intellectual stimulation to take them into the future we hope for,” Lane said. It’s also a learning opportunity for parents to talk with local experts, such as Diane Silberstein from the Oregon State University Klamath Basin Research and Extension Center, about healthy habits and producing meals at home on a budget. Silberstein, who works in schools to educate students about nutrition and physical exercise as part of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, brings the same ideology to Park and Play during the summer, she said, creating tasters and samples of cost-efficient recipes that families can make at home. “Talking to parents in a park-like setting makes it more comfortable,” she said. The program is funded by grants from the Walmart State Giving Foundation and the team is also reimbursed an average of $3 per meal by the Child Adult Care Food Program, through the Oregon Department of Education, Wood said, which also nominated the program for the award. “The great work we are doing is getting around and people are identifying that,” she said. “Klamath Falls is doing great things to adjust childhood hunger.” “It’s more than just a free lunch with the stigma on only feeding kids in poverty. It’s all about trying to get the community, kids and their families together every day during the summer to learn about nutrition and be mentored by role models.” — YMCA Program Development Director Renea Wood Tags Park And Play Child Hunger Coalition Of Klamath County Usda Award Klamath County Summer Lunch Program Child Hunger Poverty December Politics Renea Wood Food Program Play Hunger Meal Valeree Lane Diane Silberstein Economics Gastronomy Park Trending Remembering Dr. Van Dyke UPDATE: Dr. Stephanie Van Dyke has died Missing trio found alive at Crater Lake Van Dyke remains in critical condition Couple returning home after Crater Lake rescue Video Highlights Video Klamath Union at Henley Basketball Highlights Jan 14, 2017 Highlights from the girls and boys basketball games between Klamath Union and Henley.

From a clothing line to an appearance on “Dancing with the Stars” two years ago at age 17, Robertson is fast carving her own niche in the entertainment world. Robertson, who is now 19, will join Christian music’s annual 2017 Winter Jam tour this winter. The tour, which sells out some of the largest arenas in the United States, will make a stop at 6 p.m. Sunday, Jan. 29, at Sprint Center, 1407 Grand Blvd. in Kansas City, Mo. Featured artists will include Crowder, Britt Nicole, Tenth Avenue North, Andy Mineo, Colton Dixon, Thousand Foot Krutch and NewSong. A pre-jam party will feature artists OBB, Sarah Reeves and Steve Malcolm. Tony Nolan also will make appearances. Tickets for the show, as usual, are only $10 cash at the door. No advance tickets are sold in advance. Speaking by phone recently from Charleston, W. Va., where the first show of Winter Jam was to take place that night, Robertson said she was thrilled to be a part of the tour. “I’m so excited,” she gushed. “This is the first day of the tour. We just had a great rehearsal. It’s going to be great.” Robertson’s role on the tour won’t be to sing, but rather to interview some of the artists before each show at an extra event known as “Jam Nation” — a kind of VIP event for which attendees pay extra so they can get up-close and personal with the artists. Fans will text questions they would like to ask the artists, the questions will pop up on a big screen and Robertson will then ask the artists the questions. As the initial “Jam Nation” was to take place that night, Robertson said she hadn’t been able to determine her favorite artist to interview. But she said she thought she had an idea who that might be. “Crowder,” she said. “They say he doesn’t really answer the questions. He just does a stand-up comedy routine.” Robertson also will come on stage near the end of the concert to present a brief message to attendees. Like other members of the Robertson family, Sadie is an unabashed Christian. She said the fact that her family members were known as much for living their Christian faith on the “Duck Dynasty” series as they were for the men’s long beards. “I think people were starving for that,” she said. “I think they were craving for that. I think it helped open up the doors for other people to live out their faith on TV.” Sadie, the daughter of Willie and Korie Robertson, said there were some funny moments that she experienced by being on “Duck Dynasty,” as she was just an average teen in Monroe, La. “I went to our local Walmart one time and I saw a picture of my dad on some underpants,” she said. “Then I looked up and there was ‘Duck Dynasty’ on every single TV in the store.” Robertson graduated from high school this past spring and since has moved to Nashville, Tenn. She said the show didn’t cause her or any of her family members to change who they were, despite all the attention that came their way. “We may have had some fame,” she said, “but it didn’t change our hearts.” For more information on Winter Jam, call (816) 949-7100 or visit www.sprintcenter.com or www.jamtour.com.

Stephenson St. Construction started in late October, after Zealous Art Studio & Tattoo vacated and left the parcel with about 12,050 square feet of free space, including new bathrooms. The deli expansion opened in November to coincide with downtown Freeport's Mistletoe Walk. Now, there's room for a handicap-accessible 32-seat dining room, plus a retail section featuring Rockford-based products such as Candle Crest, JavaMania, The Canine Crunchery and more. "Once people find out we have seating, they enjoy it," Thompson said. "You don't see it from the streets; it's behind a wall. You don't have people walking by staring at you while eating, which is important. I see a lot of benefit in it." Hilldale Dairy's expansion reflects the business climate in downtown Freeport, which experienced more openings in 2016 than the prior year. In 2016, 18 businesses opened downtown, 10 expanded or were remodeled and five closed, according to Danielle Rogers, executive director of Freeport Downtown Development Foundation. Compare that to 2015 when six downtown businesses opened, two expanded and three closed.Camaraderie by local businesses, an improving economy and more focus on the community has helped the downtown business work toward a thriving area for commerce, Rogers said. "The work that's been done by Freeport Downtown Development Foundation and downtown businesses has been incredible," said  Rogers. "In addition to a lot of new businesses, there have been a lot of new initiatives. There are a lot of moving parts and everything is playing well together, and it shows in the numbers." Freeport All In, the rebranding campaign also known as Collaborate Freeport, is one such initiative, Rogers said. Barber Gary "Amo" Amodeo estimates he's cut thousands of clients' hairs in the 50 years he's been working out of Freeport. He's moved around the city over the years, but in the last month, he opened his shop at 11 E. Main St. Before that, he briefly operated out of Locust Street and before that, he spent 30 years on West Stephenson Street. "It looks more like a barber shop," Amodeo said. "It's clean and bright. My shop is clean; I've been to other shops I wouldn't even want to work at." He said downtown business has "gotten a little better." "I don't think Freeport is failing, but most of the shopping is now at Wal-Mart, Walgreen's and Shopko," Amodeo said.Rogers said she hope the growth continues in 2017. "We're all about positivity," Rogers said. "We're really going to get our name out there that it's a place to live and shop and we have great events." Adam Poulisse: 815-987-1344; apoulisse@rrstar.com; @adampoulisse About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Site Services Purchase Photos E-Edition Contact Us Gas Prices Submit News Weddings Engagements Anniversaries Market Place Classifieds Cars Rentals Coupons Community Info City of Freeport Stephenson County Carroll County Ogle County Jo Daviess County Sports iHigh IHSA HighSchoolSports.net Sign up for our Daily Deals Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2017 GateHouse Media, LLC.
