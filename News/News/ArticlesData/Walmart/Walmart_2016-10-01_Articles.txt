That means that heading into the busy holiday season, the company is advancing its lead over major retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores and search engines as the starting point for online shopping. Fifty-five percent of those surveyed go to Amazon first when searching for products, an increase from 44 percent a year earlier, according to a Labor Day weekend poll of 2,000 people released by the Internet marketing firm BloomReach Inc. The second annual survey showed search engines, such as Google and Yahoo, and retailers losing ground to Amazon. Search engines were the starting point for 28 percent of those surveyed, declining from 34 percent a year earlier. Specific retailers were the starting point for 16 percent, down from 21 percent. “Amazon has become the reference point for shoppers,” said Jason Seeba, head of marketing for BloomReach. “Shoppers will go to Amazon first to find a product and check prices.” The survey results are bad news for Wal-Mart and other retailers trying to make headway against Amazon in online shopping. E-commerce sales are expected to increase 13 percent to $385 billion this year, according to eMarketer. Wal-Mart last month agreed to buy e-commerce startup Jet.com for $3.3 billion, its biggest attempt yet to catch up. Amazon Prime, the Seattle-based company’s $99-a-year subscription that includes delivery discounts, video and music streaming and online photo storage, has been key to overshadowing competitors in the minds of consumers, said John Blackledge, an analyst at Cowen & Co. Blackledge estimates Amazon had 49 million prime members in August and subscription growth is accelerating. Amazon has added free same-day delivery and two-hour delivery to Prime subscriptions, as well as food delivery in many cities, increasing the value of membership.

Tony Gutierrez/AP/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of Walmart's Black Friday ad is the hottest of the hot. Every year, when Black Friday season starts to heat up, we get comment after comment, email after email, begging for information about Walmart's elusive Black Friday ad. While this frenzy can be fun, the truth is that you don't need the Black Friday circular to plan for your holiday shopping at Walmart. Why? Because the old ads tell us everything we need to know.  When will we see the 2016 Walmart Black Friday ad? I get it, you wanna see what exciting new deals are on sale this year. To figure out when, exactly we're going to see the 2016 ads, let's take a look at Walmart's publication dates from the last few years: 2013: Monday, November 11 2014: Tuesday, November 11 2015: Wednesday, November 11 Walmart is super into 11/11 as an ideal ad release day, but the 11th has been earlier in the week these past few years, not on a Friday as it will be in 2016. The ad probably won't drop on Tuesday the 8th, which is Election Day, but we could see it coming out as early as Wednesday, November 9. If it's not out by then, Friday, November 11th will likely be our lucky day. Make a wish for crazy savings! Recommended: Are you a smart shopper? Take our quiz. Once the Walmart ad arrives, you'll find it in our  2016 Black Friday Shopping Guide. Test your knowledge Are you a smart shopper? Take our quiz. Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/18 What will Walmart's Black Friday hours be? Walmart has been opening its doors at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day for the past three years, and we expect it to hold with this pattern in 2016. It's interesting to note that, while Black Friday sale start times have been steadily increasing from 2007 on, last year, a few stores, like Staples and Gamestop made a statement by reversing their stance on Thanksgiving Day hours and reverting back to early morning Black Friday bonanza sales. While we don't expect Walmart to do anything this drastic, if they DID, it would be a game changer for the Black Friday industry. We can dream, but the reality is likely going to be a 6 p.m. Thanksgiving sale start time. If you're not feeling the idea of ditching your loving family on Thanksgiving Day and dealing with frantic crowds of deal chasers, you probably won't have to. Last year marked the first time that most of the big box store's doorbuster deals were available online, starting at 12:01 a.m. on Thanksgiving Day. We expect to see a similar online sale happening this year, so stay up late while you're marinating the turkey, and hop onto Walmart.com to skip the lines. What should you expect from Walmart Black Friday Doorbusters? Small kitchen electronics for under $10 Walmart always has small kitchen electronics, like a crockpot, a coffee maker, a toaster and a skillet, on sale for under $10. Last year they were going for $9.72, the year before, $9.77, and in 2013, these items were sold for $9.44. We don't expect to see much of a change in price this year, so you'll likely see same stuff on sale for under $10! Chromecasts for $20 or less Last year, the streaming device was on sale for $20, and it was $25 in 2014. As these plugin devices get more and more mainstream, we're expecting to see them at Walmart for $19 this year, if not a little less. Get ready to turn your regular old television into a Smart TV for less than $20. Beats Pill Speakers for $100 Walmart has offered a deal on Beats Pills for the last four years. While last year's deal was $149.99, 2014's Black Friday sale offered them for $99.95. We're guessing Walmart will chop off the extra $50 they added on last year and go back to the $100 mark in 2016. 24-piece Pyrex set for $19 This has been at $19 for the past two years, so we predict we're going to see it back there come Black Friday. Right now it's going for $26.42, which isn't too much more than the Black Friday price. More encore Black Friday Deals at Walmart These are just a few of the deals we expect to see return for Black Friday at Walmart. This is not meant to be an exhaustive list.

Sulphur Springs Police Chief Jay Sanders said the motorcycle ridden by Randall Jenkins, 59, of Sulphur Springs was travelling east on Posey Lane when a Jeep pulled out of a driveway and into his path. “There was a vehicle turning in to Walmart, I believe it was a truck and there was a vehicle wanting to come out of the Walmart entrance onto Posey and turning back west,” Sanders said. “According to that driver, he couldn't see but started to pull out. When he did pull out, he saw the motorcycle, but it was too late. I would imagine the motorcycle did not see him and it was too late.” Sanders said there were very few skid marks that would indicate the motorcycle operator could not see the Jeep before colliding with it. “The motorcycle rider was thrown about 30 feet,” Sanders said. “We saw the video of it. It was hard to see but we know what happened.” Jenkins sustained serious head injuries and was first taken to the emergency room to be stabilized before he was airlifted. He was on the way to Dallas Parkland Hospital before the flight was diverted to Baylor Hospital. Sanders said he talked to the man's family this morning. “He is actually showing improvement,” Sanders said. “He is not out of the woods yet, because this is a pretty serious head injury, but he is showing improvement.” Set as favorite Bookmark Email this Hits: 1070 Comments (0) Show/hide comments Write comment Show/hide comment form Email Title Comment smaller | bigger Subscribe via email (registered users only) I have read and agree to the Terms of Usage.

(Bloomberg photo by Sean Proctor) Shoppers push carts through the grocery department at a Wal-Mart in Chicago in November. (Bloomberg photo by Daniel Acker) By Craig Giammona, Bloomberg News Oct 1, 2016 at 11:30 am | Print View Call it the Great Grocery Store Giveaway of 2016. In Austin, Texas, Randalls slashed prices for boneless beef ribs by 40 percent, to $3.99 a pound. Not to be outdone, the H-E-B grocer down the street charged $1 a pound less. Albertsons recently advertised a deal you don’t normally see on your finer cuts of meat — “buy 1 get 1 free” specials on “USDA Choice Petite Sirloin Steak.” And what does $1 buy these days? In North Bergen, N.J., you could pick up a dozen eggs at Wal-Mart. (The price was actually $1.14.) A mile away, at Aldi, the German supermarket discounter, which can actually break the buck — 12 eggs for 99 cents. A year ago you would have paid, on average, three times that price. But almost unheard of outside a recession, food prices have fallen for nine straight months in the United States. It’s the longest streak of food deflation since 1960 — with the exception of 2009, when the financial crisis was winding down. Analysts credit low oil and grain prices, as well as cutthroat competition from discounters. Consumers are winning out, but grocery chains, not so much. Their margins and, in some cases, their stock prices, are taking a hit. Eggs and beef have grown especially inexpensive, and it isn’t only an American phenomenon. In England, Aldi recently offered its prized eight-ounce wagyu steaks from New Zealand for about $6.50 — a little more than the price of a pint of beer. “The severity of what we’re seeing is completely unprecedented,” said Scott Mushkin, an analyst at Wolfe Research who has studied grocery prices around the country for more than 10 years. “We’ve never seen deflation this sharp.” Mushkin, who researches local markets, recently found that prices of a typical basket of grocery items in Houston had fallen almost five percent over the past year. It could get worse He credits, in part, the discerning behavior of shoppers like Manny Sinclair. On a weekday lunch break, the 43-year-old contractor stopped by a Wal-Mart in Secaucus, N.J., to pick up turtle food and paper towels. Sinclair typically buys groceries at his local ShopRite but recently has noticed the deals he now finds at discounters. He glanced at the meat case, where a 12-pack of “Angus steak burgers” fetched $15.82 and grass-fed ground beef could change hands for $4.96 a pound. Sinclair was intrigued but, in the classic logic of a shopper in an age of deflation, figured he might find even lower prices elsewhere. Along with two Wal-Marts, a Target and an Aldi, the area even offers a Family Dollar that features a small refrigerated section. “Wherever I find the good deals — that’s where I’m at,” Sinclair said. At first, falling prices helped grocers. Low-cost commodities pushed down the tab for meat and packaged food and boosted profits. Now, deflation has turned ugly for the industry. Led by Wal-Mart, retailers are pushing down prices, eating away at their profit margins. “It starts to border on irrational pricing,” said Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “People are lowering prices just to draw traffic, without thinking about their margins.” Supermarkets are facing competition not just from Wal-Mart Stores and Aldi but also dollar stores and online retailer Amazon.com. It could get worse. Lidl, one of Aldi’s German competitors, is building three distribution centers on the East Coast and plans to open U.S. stores by 2018. Even Whole Foods Market — famously derided as “Whole Paycheck” — is trying to compete on price through digital coupons and promotions on items such as beer and produce. In recent years, Kroger — the largest grocery store chain in the United States, with nearly 2,800 stores — cut prices to compete with Wal-Mart and managed to increase its market share and sales. But deflation has been hard on the supermarket chain. The company’s stock has lost more than a quarter of its value this year, as price cuts weighed on profits. CEO Rodney McMullen expressed frustration that many customers don’t even notice. “The other thing that’s always hard is getting your message out because it’s fascinating — in our research, most people are saying their basket of goods costs more money,” McMullen said on a call with analysts this month. The likely reason for McMullen’s lament: Food, on average, makes up only about 15 percent of a consumer’s budget. Except for gas and other energy-related items, prices for most other goods are going up, if only modestly. At the same time, restaurant food still can be pricey. The situation makes for some strange contrasts: In Chicago, a pound of Dunkin’ Donuts coffee sells for $4.99 at a Jewel-Osco store, less than the cost of a venti pumpkin spice frappuccino at Starbucks. Albertsons Cos. owns Jewel-Osco, as well as Randalls, home of the cheap Texas ribs. Elena Rosa, 63, a retired health aide, was blasé when she steered her shopping cart past the refrigerator case at Aldi in North Bergen, N.J. She paused, noting a dozen eggs for less than $1 — one of the great food deals of recent memory. “That’s a good price,” she said, before moving on without buying a carton.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 1, 2016 at 10:43AM $1,000 might not seem like enough money to invest in the stock market. But in a previous article, I noted that well-timed investments of $1,000 in Apple or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) would each be worth about half a million dollars now. Today, I'll go a step further and discuss two stocks that turned $1,000 into several million dollars over several decades. Disney Disney (NYSE:DIS) went public in 1957 at $13.88 per share. $1,000 would have been enough to buy 72 shares. After six splits, you would have 27,648 shares today, which would be worth $2.55 million at today's prices. That massive stake would also be paying out $39,260 in dividends every year. Image source: Pixabay. Granted, $1,000 in 1957 is equivalent to about $8,500 in today's dollars. Nonetheless, an $8,500 investment that blossoms into a $2.55 million one reveals the market-crushing potential of investing in well-run companies over the long term. It also demonstrates the value of patience. In the 1960s and 1970s, Disney was one of the "Nifty 50" stocks which were considered solid "buy and hold" investments and fueled the bull market in the early 1970s. But when the bear market hit later that decade, Disney and the rest of the Nifty 50 were aggressively sold off. The House of Mouse then languished for years as theme park attendance waned and the company's family friendly movies saw big box office declines. Disney only recovered after Michael Eisner, the former CEO of Paramount, took over as CEO and had the company acquire Touchstone Pictures, Capital Cities ABC, ESPN, and other higher-growth media properties to become a media powerhouse. Eisner also oversaw the "Disney Renaissance" between 1989 and 1999, which saw the House Of Mouse release hit animated films like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King. Eisner's successor, Bob Iger, further expanded Disney's media empire with the acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm. Today, Disney faces fresh headwinds, with cord cutters threatening to derail its cable TV business. But Disney continues evolving to face these challenges with new streaming platforms and investments in "new media" companies -- indicating that it could still have room to run. Wal-Mart Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) went public at $16.50 per share in 1970. $1,000, or $6,500 in today's dollars, would have been enough to buy 60 shares. After splitting 11 times, those shares would have multiplied to 122,880 shares -- which would be worth $8.82 million today. You would also be receiving $245,760 in dividends per year. Image source: Wal-Mart. Like Disney, Wal-Mart was a member of the Nifty 50 that initially soared but faced tough challenges during the bear market of the mid-1970s. But as Wal-Mart spread across America and other countries with its superstore format, it drove smaller competitors out of business with economies of scale. As a result, its annual revenues rose from $1.3 billion in 1980 to $165 billion in 2000. Wal-Mart didn't face any significant challenges until Amazon evolved from an online bookseller into an online superstore in the late 1990s. The company failed to keep up in online sales, and its sales growth fell far behind Amazon's. Source: YCharts Amazon aggressively expanded its ecosystem with Amazon Prime, new services like grocery and food deliveries, and (soon) drone deliveries. Wal-Mart fought back by matching Amazon's prices, launching its own subscription-based delivery service, and expanding its digital ecosystem of streaming media and online payments. It also recently agreed to buy e-commerce start-up Jet.com for $3.3 billion. CEO Doug McMillon, who took over the top job in 2014, is trying to reinvent the massive retailer with billions of dollars in investments in e-commerce, employee training, and higher wages. The jury's still out on those efforts, and analysts expect Wal-Mart to post just 1% sales growth this year. But if they pay off, Wal-Mart's sales growth might pick up over the next few years. The bottom line The growth of Disney and Wal-Mart over the past few decades reaffirms Benjamin Graham's famed statement: "In the short run, the market is a voting machine; but in the long run, it is a weighing machine." Therefore, long-term investors who want to turn thousands into millions should analyze a company's growth potential in decades instead of quarters.   Leo Sun owns shares of Amazon.com and Walt Disney.

Food prices have fallen for nine straight months in the U.S. (Photo: Sean Proctor, Bloomberg) 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Call it the Great Grocery-Store Giveaway of 2016. In Austin, Texas, Randalls slashed prices for boneless beef ribs by 40 percent, to $3.99 a pound. Not to be outdone, the H-E-B grocer down the street charged $1 a pound less. Albertsons recently advertised a deal you don't normally see on your finer cuts of meat: "buy 1 get 1 free" specials on "USDA Choice Petite Sirloin Steak." And what does $1 buy these days? In North Bergen, New Jersey, you could pick up a dozen eggs at Wal-Mart. (OK, the price was actually $1.14.) A mile away, check out Aldi, the German supermarket discounter, which can actually break the buck — 12 eggs for 99 cents. A year ago you would have paid, on average, three times that price. In a startling development, almost unheard of outside a recession, food prices have fallen for nine straight months in the U.S. It's the longest streak of food deflation since 1960 -- with the exception of 2009, when the financial crisis was winding down. Analysts credit low oil and grain prices, as well as cutthroat competition from discounters. Consumers are winning out; grocery chains, not so much. Their margins and, in some cases, their stock prices, are taking a hit. Eggs and beef have have grown especially inexpensive, and it isn't only an American phenomenon: In England, Aldi recently offered its prized 8-ounce wagyu steaks from New Zealand for about $6.50, a little more than the price of a pint of beer. "The severity of what we're seeing is completely unprecedented," said Scott Mushkin, an analyst at Wolfe Research who has studied grocery prices around the country for more than 10 years. "We've never seen deflation this sharp." Shoppers push carts through the grocery department at a Wal-Mart in Chicago on Nov. 25. Supermarkets are facing competition from Wal-Mart Stores and Aldi, as well as dollar stores and Amazon.com.  (Photo: Daniel Acker, Bloomberg) Mushkin, who researches local markets, recently found that prices of a typical basket of grocery items in Houston had fallen almost 5 percent over the past year. He credits, in part, the discerning behavior of shoppers like Manny Sinclair. On a weekday lunch break, the 43-year-old contractor stopped by a Wal-Mart in Secaucus, New Jersey, to pick up turtle food and paper towels. Sinclair typically buys groceries at his local ShopRite but has recently noticed the steals he now finds at discounters. He glanced at the meat case, where a 12-pack of "Angus steak burgers" fetched $15.82 and grass-fed ground beef could change hands for $4.96 a pound. Sinclair was intrigued but, in the classic logic of a shopper in an age of deflation, figured he might find even lower prices elsewhere.

Chase Down Love in the Bike Lane This Date Night September 30, 2016 11:37 pm by Marjon Carlos|edited by Chelsea Zalopany email Expand Photographed by Phil Oh In full disclosure, I don’t know how to ride a bike. I mean, I do. I must. I’ve heard there’s nothing quite like riding a bike . . . and yet, I have avoided them for several years now. I know, I know—but since balance is all I’ve got in such a fast-paced, nonstop city like New York, the idea of losing it for a second due to a popped tire or oncoming traffic terrifies me. So naturally, when Citi Bike became a phenomenon a couple of years ago, I paid it no mind. While girls in my Brooklyn neighborhood pedaled along atop their blue-and-red two-wheelers, the hems of their sundresses flapping in the wind, I was sidestepping the action altogether, feeling more carefree with both of my well-shod feet planted firmly on the ground. Of course, little did I know that these little bike depots across the city were quickly becoming dating hubs, or, rather, the wiliest of my coworkers (and, apparently, Leonardo DiCaprio) were using them as such. “Hot guys bike!” Vogue.com Fashion News Writer Liana Satenstein boldly declared one afternoon. Considering her often eccentric taste, I was unconvinced, but before I could prod further, Market Editor Anny Choi piped up from over an office wall: “Especially in this FiDi area with all the banks around!” Moments later, the two were buzzing around my desk. “Potentially crashing into your next date is always a viable option,” Choi said. “And it sure beats being wedged between college students in the back of an UberPool,” Satenstein added with a smirk. But seriously: There’s an element of surprise and adventure to biking that’s impressive to potential dates. “It shows that you have somewhat of a dangerous quality about you,” Satenstein continued. And, she pointed out, a bicycle can get you out of any possibly unpleasant date situations: “If you don’t want an awkward cab-splitting with a date or to talk about spending the night, you can just say that you have your bike and book it the hell out of there. And never look back!” And so I found myself lingering over a Citi Bike rack, contemplating getting back on the open road this date night.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 1, 2016 at 10:43AM $1,000 might not seem like enough money to invest in the stock market. But in a previous article, I noted that well-timed investments of $1,000 in Apple or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) would each be worth about half a million dollars now. Today, I'll go a step further and discuss two stocks that turned $1,000 into several million dollars over several decades. Disney Disney (NYSE:DIS) went public in 1957 at $13.88 per share. $1,000 would have been enough to buy 72 shares. After six splits, you would have 27,648 shares today, which would be worth $2.55 million at today's prices. That massive stake would also be paying out $39,260 in dividends every year. Image source: Pixabay. Granted, $1,000 in 1957 is equivalent to about $8,500 in today's dollars. Nonetheless, an $8,500 investment that blossoms into a $2.55 million one reveals the market-crushing potential of investing in well-run companies over the long term. It also demonstrates the value of patience. In the 1960s and 1970s, Disney was one of the "Nifty 50" stocks which were considered solid "buy and hold" investments and fueled the bull market in the early 1970s. But when the bear market hit later that decade, Disney and the rest of the Nifty 50 were aggressively sold off. The House of Mouse then languished for years as theme park attendance waned and the company's family friendly movies saw big box office declines. Disney only recovered after Michael Eisner, the former CEO of Paramount, took over as CEO and had the company acquire Touchstone Pictures, Capital Cities ABC, ESPN, and other higher-growth media properties to become a media powerhouse. Eisner also oversaw the "Disney Renaissance" between 1989 and 1999, which saw the House Of Mouse release hit animated films like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King. Eisner's successor, Bob Iger, further expanded Disney's media empire with the acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm. Today, Disney faces fresh headwinds, with cord cutters threatening to derail its cable TV business. But Disney continues evolving to face these challenges with new streaming platforms and investments in "new media" companies -- indicating that it could still have room to run. Wal-Mart Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) went public at $16.50 per share in 1970. $1,000, or $6,500 in today's dollars, would have been enough to buy 60 shares. After splitting 11 times, those shares would have multiplied to 122,880 shares -- which would be worth $8.82 million today. You would also be receiving $245,760 in dividends per year. Image source: Wal-Mart. Like Disney, Wal-Mart was a member of the Nifty 50 that initially soared but faced tough challenges during the bear market of the mid-1970s. But as Wal-Mart spread across America and other countries with its superstore format, it drove smaller competitors out of business with economies of scale. As a result, its annual revenues rose from $1.3 billion in 1980 to $165 billion in 2000. Wal-Mart didn't face any significant challenges until Amazon evolved from an online bookseller into an online superstore in the late 1990s. The company failed to keep up in online sales, and its sales growth fell far behind Amazon's. Source: YCharts Amazon aggressively expanded its ecosystem with Amazon Prime, new services like grocery and food deliveries, and (soon) drone deliveries. Wal-Mart fought back by matching Amazon's prices, launching its own subscription-based delivery service, and expanding its digital ecosystem of streaming media and online payments. It also recently agreed to buy e-commerce start-up Jet.com for $3.3 billion. CEO Doug McMillon, who took over the top job in 2014, is trying to reinvent the massive retailer with billions of dollars in investments in e-commerce, employee training, and higher wages. The jury's still out on those efforts, and analysts expect Wal-Mart to post just 1% sales growth this year. But if they pay off, Wal-Mart's sales growth might pick up over the next few years. The bottom line The growth of Disney and Wal-Mart over the past few decades reaffirms Benjamin Graham's famed statement: "In the short run, the market is a voting machine; but in the long run, it is a weighing machine." Therefore, long-term investors who want to turn thousands into millions should analyze a company's growth potential in decades instead of quarters.   Leo Sun owns shares of Amazon.com and Walt Disney.

Smith turned to a legal insurance plan that he had taken out for situations just like this. With the help of an attorney, a settlement was negotiated with the district attorney’s office to get the misdemeanor dismissed upon the 16-year-old’s completion of community service hours. And thanks to the legal plan with ARAG, Smith figures he saved more than $2,000 in attorney fees and a lot of time, not to mention avoiding stress. The coverage “saved us from having to pay a lot of money,” said Smith, a police officer in Austin, Texas, “and it saved my son’s reputation. He wants to go to college, and having any kind of a record would have made it difficult.” Companies like ARAG, U.S. Legal Services and others have designed legal insurance plans that are offered as part of employer-sponsored benefit plans or sold directly to consumers. And insurers are seeing a growing number of parents purchasing the coverage. Parents can purchase the protection for a range of legal matters ranging from traffic violations and apartment leases to more serious problems such as theft and personal injury claims. The cost? Premiums are typically less than $20 a month and carry a deductible of $250 or so. For some parents, legal insurance can provide peace of mind in the event their teenager or college-age child gets into trouble. And let’s face it, even the best kids sometimes do stupid things. Here’s how ARAG’s standard policy works: When a policyholder has a legal problem, he or she contacts the company and explains the problem. Once the legal issue is identified, the insurer provides the policyholder with a list of qualified attorneys who practice nearby. The policyholder then picks the attorney and makes the contact. ARAG has a network of about 11,000 attorneys with different specialties. The company generally aims to provide attorneys who practice within a 30-mile radius of the policyholder. Smith is a believer in the protection. The father of six pays about $14 a month, or $168 a year, for his legal plan, which is offered through the police department. While having the policy lessened the impact of the candy theft on Smith’s son, the outcome was far different for his son’s best friend, who wasn’t covered through legal insurance. The teen was fined, had to perform twice as much community service work and still has the misdemeanor on his record, which eventually might require the help of an attorney to have it removed when he becomes an adult. Laura Budd, an attorney near Charlotte, N.C., who has been in the ARAG network since 2004, has handled multiple cases involving kids who got into trouble. Having immediate access to an attorney, Budd said, “keeps kids out of the (legal) system.” Still, is legal insurance the answer? Certainly, the benefits may not be worth the price for some. Do the math, and factor in the deductible. Moreover when reviewing these policies, pay attention to what is covered and what is not. Some policies will broaden the coverage, but at a higher price. And some serious legal problems won’t be covered at all. Like other types of insurance, you’re also paying for some peace of mind just in case your son or daughter gets into a jam. Backing this legal protection up with stern advice to your kids is also key. There needs to be a discussion about responsible behavior, owning a mistake and the consequences for getting into trouble. No legal insurance plan will cover all those bases for you.

It's a big number, even considering the fact that the biggest reason there's so much student loan debt is because more and more people — and not just those whose families can afford it upfront — are going to college.  The average amount of debt on student loans is about $37,000, but whether someone owes $5,000 or $100,000, debt can cast a shadow over their entire life. And not all debt feels the same. Someone who graduated from a four-year university might be better able to manage their debt load than someone who dropped out of a community college or a for-profit after a few semesters.  Jen Smith knows what that's like. She's the first person in her family to go to college — she went to the for profit International Academy of Design and Technology (IADT) in Chicago. She left after a year and a half. IADT's parent company has since closed several campuses. When Smith went back to school to get her nursing degree, she found out the credits she earned there didn't count.  "I didn't know that those credits would be worthless," Smith said. "Who would sign up for something like that?" Since leaving IADT, the original $27,000 loan Smith took out has ballooned to $45,000. She has a job in human resources now, while working towards her nursing degree.  Sandy Baum, who studies debt at the Urban Institute, says that for a majority of students who attend traditional colleges, debt isn't a crisis, or even a problem. "They don't like repaying their debts, but they're fine," Baum said. "Their earnings premium from going to college is far higher than is necessary to pay back those loans."   The for-profit schools present a different problem. "We have too many people borrowing to go to institutions, and programs that we know in advance are not going to serve them well," Baum said. "That's a crisis." Like IADT, some other for-profit programs have struggled, or even shuttered in recent months. Corinthian and ITT Tech collapsed, leaving thousands of students with ruined credit, and, potentially, piles of debt. But in the last 15 years, loans have become a bigger issue for traditional schools, too. Part of the reason is that the cost of attending a public university has gone up by 54 percent since 2000.  Sara Goldrick-Rab,  a professor at Temple University who studies the price of higher education, said "the major thing driving that increase is that states used to fund public higher education. They withdrew some of their support and in doing so, somebody has to pick up that tab and they basically decided that the people going to college and their families should pay for that."  For students who started school in the years before the recession, the price change was acute. Chris Savelle, who studied finance at Central Michigan University, said the price of a credit went up dramatically — from $148 when he started school in 2002 to $324 by the time he graduated in December 2008.  Toby the dog stares out the window at the home Chris Savelle shares with his mother and sister. After his father died and his mother was laid off, Chris began supporting his family while paying off his student loans.  - Eliza Mills/Marketplace Savelle has about $100,000 in loans, and pays $1000 a month on the interest. He doesn't blame his school for his debt load, though. "I did this to myself," Savelle says,  "I knew, when I was taking out these loans, that I was building up a bigger and bigger debt burden but told myself 'I'll have a good job when I get out of college.'" Savelle wanted to work on Wall Street as a trader, but finding a good job during was harder than he anticipated it to be. After six months of unemployment, he got a job as a manager at a Walmart.  "We used to make jokes in that store because it was one of the most well-qualified Walmart stores I think we've ever seen. The number of laid-off engineers was amazing," Savelle says. After nine months at Walmart, Savelle got lucky, and found a job in supply chain engineering. It wasn't high finance, but he likes it, and makes $85,000 a year, enough to support his mother and sister and cover rent for the house the three of them share, make payments on his loans and save a bit for retirement.  Even though his debt is in a manageable place now, Savelle's loans continue to have a major impact on him and his family. His younger sister, Katie, is terrified of debt. She dropped of college after one semester because she wasn't happy, and immediately paid off her debt with earnings from a part-time job at a bakery. She's not sure if she'll go back to school, but is considering a trade certificate instead of a four-year program. Having six figures in student debt isn't the norm — Savelle is an outlier. But he's also a study in what happened to a generation of students whose time in school coincided with rising prices and stagnating middle class wages.  "The people who are most impacted are low income, African American, Latino families who finally put a child, put their family through college, and now seeing they are stuck with this lifetime of debt that even if the parents and grandparents try to help, they can't seem to ever make the payments," said Lisa Madigan, an Illinois attorney general who is pushing loan servicers  — companies who collect payments and process loans — to automatically enroll borrowers in income-based repayment plans.  Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan in her office in Chicago. Madigan is pushing for loan servicers to enroll borrowers in income based repayment plans.  - Eliza Mills/Markeptlace   Income-based repayment is an option for all borrowers, but many don't know that they're eligible and many complain that debt servicers don't assist them in finding a manageable solution. Instead, they push them to make the highest payments possible.  Almost all student debt is owned or guaranteed by the Federal government — in 2010 the government took over making federal loans, often contracting loan servicers. Servicers will make about $2 billion in commission from the Department of Education this year, but many borrowers have complaints about the way servicers handle their loans.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) monitors complaints about loan servicers and is working to create and enforce guidelines for loan servicers, to make sure that the billions they collect from the government to collect on federal loans are going towards services that make repayment more manageable for families.  CFPB Ombudsman Seth Frotman said, "there are supposed to be protections for all of these borrowers who thought they were doing the right thing by going to school, taking on this historic level of debt, and the promise kind of was 'you'll never have to pay more than you can afford.' And the very companies that are supposed to be ensuring that is the case are essentially failing borrowers for a second time." "One of the things that the bureau has been working toward, through public enforcement actions, through the first ever federal oversight of these entities, is ensuring that illegal practices will no longer be tolerated," Frotman said. The Department of Education oversees the contracts with loan servicers, and recently made an announcement about their expectations for future compliance, which would start in 2019. Frotman said that the CFPB is pushing for more immediate action. "The bureau has new tools at its disposal, so if we find that a company's practices are unfair, deceptive, or abusive, we have the ability to take action," he said. "The challenge that we face in this space is that when a market essentially doubles over a very short time, like we saw in this student loan context, the question is, have the regulators, have the people overseeing the market, have the rules kept up. In this case, they haven't," Frotman said. Any potential changes to the system, from pricing to collection to forgiveness, may not come fast enough for borrowers who are already saddled with student loan debt. But for the next generation of college students, bearing witness to struggles with student loan debt have already prompted a new outlook: asking whether a traditional college education has become too much of a financial risk.

Good News was a glossy, full color general interest, lifestyle magazine that distributed nationally. We were on the newsstands between Essence and Upscale magazines. With blogs and other online media outlets coming up, the print world took a hit. My mother, Glenda J. Black, was my co-publisher, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. With all that was going on in print media. We printed our last issue with Tyra Banks on the cover in 2006. I was at a cross road. I asked God, what do I do now? This has been my life, my dream, my passion. My husband he said, ‘You are still a storyteller. That doesn’t change. It’s your passion. How will you take it and move forward?’ My answer was television and film. I decided to transition these stories from print to the screen. I wrote and directed my first independent film in 2010, All I Want. I was able to get a really cool distribution deal with Walmart 30 days later. It was better than I thought. The film did well. I kept honing my craft and developed myself as a director and writer. We did “Couples Therapy” which aired on BET last year. The Creator, the Universe has been supporting my steps in everything I set out to do. I am blessed to be able to have a certain amount of success. It has been a journey. Everything that I hoped for I am realizing and it’s coming to pass. Where is your hometown? This is a funny story. I am from Little Rock, Arkansas. We moved to Atlanta in 1991. It’s so funny everything that is going on with the presidential elections. I grew up with Chelsea [Clinton]. Bill Clinton and Hillary were actually good friends of my parents. [Moore’s dad is a prominent Atlanta minister — Rev. Jerry D. Black, pastor of Beulah Missionary Baptist Church.] Your mom was a very, very beautiful spirit. Thank you … she is so missed. She is looking down. I know that she is very supportive. I hear her every day. She is very much still in the picture. [Glenda J. Black’s, B.A., M.Ed., career spanned as a teacher, real estate agent and magazine publisher. The first lady of Beulah Missionary Baptist Church for 16 years founded the Sisters of Faith non-profit organization, which was dedicated to promoting breast cancer awareness and survival. In her obituary, her family described her as a woman who “faced her personal challenges with cancer with tremendous fortitude, poise and grace. Glenda became a strong example of how to endure hardness as a good soldier.” She died on Thursday, July 3, 2008, at her home.] She was my life, she was my rock. It was really a rough time for me when she passed away. My best friend and husband said we are going to get back up, that’s what she’d want for you. And he said, let’s go [all hands on deck] for this film company. What’s the origin of the concept for Hollywood Hearts? “Hollywood Hearts” is Bobby V. and Ben Brown’s concept. They brought it to me. I liked it. I went away and wrote the script. They brought me on to direct the film. It’s lightly based on Bobby’s life in a sense. As he goes through the evolution, he realizes love conquers all and is the last thing standing. The other stuff is an illusion. He gets over himself when he understands his truth. Tell us what “going away to write” means for you? I leave my home. I am a wife and mother of three: Yahliel, 12; Kindred, 9; and Mica, 6. The film company, Tier 2, is busy. I am being courted to be a writer for a show on NBC. I came up with a scripted series and they love it. I am in communication with Dreamworks and NBC about it. We have a show premiering next year on weTV. We have a whole lot going on on the business side in TV and film. We are really making our imprint in the industry. When I say step away, I really hone in. I like to tell stories that are multilayered, to really relate to the characters and to focus on stories that will really move an audience. When I am trying to get it done relatively quickly, I have a special spot that I go to for three to five days to escape and get quiet. How did you and Bobby V. meet? I didn’t know Bobby V. personally. Ben introduced us. Bobby told me what he really wanted to do. I’d only heard about him and I was curious if he could handle acting. We laugh about it today. He has become a really good friend, he’s warmhearted, a good guy and jokester who kept us laughing on set. I was really proud of how well he did in the film especially considering he’s never led a film before. It’s his first lead role.

(Photo: AP) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Taking our trees In regard to Eric Adams’ Sept. 30 letter about the dying trees in Palm Springs: That is not isolated to Palm Springs and possibly has nothing to do with watering. There is apparently a disease going through the valley and mature trees and even shrubs and ground cover are dying at an alarming rate. Pepper trees and pine trees are being particularly hit hard but the disease is spreading to olive trees, queen palms, other trees, and even shrubs. Just look at The River in Rancho Mirage, the Walmart Neighborhood Center on Highway 111 in Palm Desert, the street trees on Highway 111 in Indian Wells, the pine trees on Haystack Road in Palm Desert, etc. Based on my observations, it is not inconceivalbe that we could lose 30-40 percent of our landscaping in the desert within a few years. I think people haven’t yet noticed the problem because the trees start off with one dead branch and then it slowly spreads to the rest of the tree and slowly kills it over the next year or so. Let’s hope landscapers and others address this issue soon before we lose all our trees and shrubs. Britt W. Wilson, Palm Desert Different ways to cure Hats off to Gov. Brown. This week he signed the “Right to Try” law. This gives doctors the ability to try treatments not approved by the FDA. The lives this will save are legion and I am a perfect example. In 2006, after the doctors at the VA hospital had tried all approved medications. I was sent home and told I had three weeks to three months to live. My wife was unwilling to accept their prognosis and stopped at a local health store. The clerk (whom we view as an angel) opened a large red book (PDR for Herbal Medicines). Under my condition she found a regimen of treatment. Shortly after my recovery, a respectable physician told us the reason they could not prescribe “non-FDA approved” medications is due to their malpractice insurance. Now, 10 years later I have shared my success story with many others and will continue to do so. My advice: Ask medical professionals about possible herbal medicines. Rick Raum, Banning Not a fan of Dzuro Dear Indio voters, I have lived in Thornton, Colorado, for one month now having moved from Sun City Shadow Hills in Indio. When I moved to Shadow Hills 1 1/2 years ago, as a retiree, I thought this would be my forever home where I would enjoy peace the rest of my life. This was not to be. Under the presidency of Joan Dzuro on our board of directors, she implemented such outrageous rules that my days became too unhappy. I, like many others, have moved away to a more flexible lifestyle. Dzuro favored our security patrol hiding on side streets in an effort to fine us $200 for our first offense of any moving violation. This fine doubled within a year for a second offense for anyone living at the same address, be it the same driver or spouse! She installed video and audio cameras at the reception areas at both of our lovely clubhouses to prevent residents from any misbehavior towards employees otherwise fines would be implemented. I suggest you look at other candidates who will bring happiness and peace to Indio.

News Sports Entertainment Obituaries E-Edition Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds Water available for Corry-area residents affected by leak Sunday Oct 2, 2016 at 12:48 PM Oct 3, 2016 at 5:51 AM Staff report CORRY  Water for drinking and flushing was being made available to Corry-area residents Sunday while the search continued for a large water main break in the area, authorities said. Also Sunday, the Corry Area School District announced on its website that all district schools and all activities were canceled for Monday due to the water issue. Two locations in Corry  the Salvation Army, 127 W. Washington St., and the Columbus Fire Station on West Main Street  have free bottled drinking water available for area residents, said Lyn Wittmer, the Conelway Regional Emergency Management Agency emergency coordinator. Water can also be purchased at Walmart, 961 E. Columbus Ave., as a new shipment arrived Sunday morning, Wittmer said. Residents can also pick up buckets of water at seven locations in the city of Corry and Columbus Township to use for flushing, said Wittmer. The sites are: a Washington Street parking lot between China Jade Chinese restaurant and Corry Fire Station Number 2; Chord Road; Airport Road Apartments; Snyder Circle Apartments; Shawnee Village Mobile Home Park; Corry Area Primary School parking lot; and the Columbus Fire Department in Columbus Township. Corry Police Cpl. Mark Morrison said that a leak was discovered about four days ago. Authorities on Saturday advised residents in Corry, Concord Township, Wayne Township and Columbus Village to boil their drinking water due to the "serious extensive water leak." The Corry Water Department was out "en masse" looking for the source of the leak, Morrison said. Officials encouraged residents who see any leaks that appear suspicious to call 814-964-8084.

Home Radio Video Audio The Andrew Carrington Hitchcock AFP Show Archives Free Stuff Support Store Subscribe About Login Militarized Cops Shoot Autistic Boy But No One Cares Because He’s White October 02, 2016   chris   3 Comments No one in the mainstream media seems to care about a young Autistic boy, who was shot to death by police while sat peacefully next to his father in the family car, because he doesn’t fit the current narrative that racist white cops are targeting black males. The reality is, police are militarized today and many have become threats to all of us. By Janice Matthews Few Americans know that a six-year-old first-grader, Jeremy David Mardis, was shot to death by two Marksville, La. deputy city marshals on Nov. 3, 2015 when they fired 18 rounds into the car he was sitting in with his father, Christopher Few. Five of those bullets struck Jeremy, killing him instantly, while his father survived being critically wounded, hit twice in the head and chest. Both marshals who fired into the car, Derrick Stafford, 23, and Norris Greenhouse Jr., 32 were black. Both Jeremy and his dad were white. The victims were not brandishing weapons, hadn’t posted incendiary anti-police rhetoric on their social media pages, and were not trying to grab the marshals’ guns or run away from them. In fact, police body-cam footage of the carnage, released this week in an evidentiary hearing in the case against the marshals, who have been charged with second-degree murder and attempted second-degree murder and will go to trial in November, show Few had his hands up and clearly visible when the marshals inexplicably opened fire. Little Jeremy, who was autistic, was in the seat next to his dad with his seat belt on. Emigrate While You Still Can! Learn More . . . Yet in spite of this video evidence that Few’s hands were up and empty before the shooting began, no “Hands up! Don’t shoot!” protest has ensued. No one is burning local businesses or looting the Walmart. Protestors have not shut down roads or interstate traffic or even burned any cop cars. The media has not devoted round-the-clock coverage to endlessly looping the graphic video punctuated by volatile, incendiary speeches from white church or civic leaders calling for national outrage over whites being shot and killed by racist black cops. Place your ad here Loading… The facts in this case simply don’t fit the currently accepted narrative of what police violence in America looks like. Black men being killed by cops—whether or not they’re involved in a crime or brandishing a weapon at the time of the shooting—is deemed indisputable evidence of institutional racism. White men—and little boys, in this case—being killed by cops is most often mentioned by reports, if it is reported at all, simply as tragic accidents. The calm, measured response to the horrific killing of a little boy by what should be trusted authorities is even more remarkable given the disclosure that Stafford—who emptied his semi-automatic revolver’s clip of hollow-point bullets into Few and Jeremy—“has shown a pattern of using excessive force on other people who didn’t pose a threat, according to Louisiana prosecutors,” wrote AP. The state attorney general’s office argued in court filings that Stafford’s previous “bad acts” show he is “motivated to use excessive violent force against individuals he interacts with …,” according to their recent court filing arguing the jury should be informed of his violent history. They wrote Stafford used a stun gun on a man who was handcuffed as well as on a young mother who had been placed in a police car, and broke the arm of a 16-year-old girl while stopping a fight on a school bus.   There are certainly many good cops in America, who put themselves in the line of fire to protect citizens every day. Yet the militarization of today’s police forces, via both equipment and training, has led to far too many out-of-control “soldiers” who take to the streets with a mentality of ruthlessly going after “the enemy.” All too often, the perceived enemy is the very citizens that pay to be protected and served. To quell the rising surge of police violence, law enforcement personnel who are committing brutality and murder must be held to account just like any other American criminal, as is the case now for Stafford and Greenhouse in Louisiana. On a wider scale, law enforcement training must be de-militarized. Techniques for de-escalating situations must once again be taught and reinforced and military equipment now being used by police departments around the country must be decommissioned, so that police officers begin to truly protect and serve the citizens they now view as the enemy. Janice Matthews is a writer and editor, who lives in Florida.

Not you. You are completely missing the point ;D Its a white genocide plan that works by inducing white guilt instead of informing people that 3rd world nations are RESPONSIBLE for the state of their nations, just as we are responsible for our own – and for our own lives. Thats what he’s talking about. (also, vaccines prob cause autism) Danielle Tate says: October 3, 2016 at 11:13 Excuse me, but plenty of us are pissed about Jeremy’s death. He was autistic; the entire autism community knows his name, just like we know the names of other autistics killed by police (many of which, by the way, are both black and autistic–a deadly combination). Don’t accuse us of not caring just because he was white. He was *six*. He was innocent. He might not fit the profile of the average autistic victim of a trigger-happy policeman, but that doesn’t mean we don’t care when the police shoot one of our own. Many of us have had good cops save our lives, or our autistic kids’ lives, and we wish there were more like that. But we can’t stay deluded into thinking that trigger-happy jerkwads like the people involved in Jeremy Mardis’s murder don’t exist, because they do.

The legendary Tuskegee Airmen have been the subject of a documentary, filmed by two Augusta-area partners, that's still growing in popularity. Bryan Williams and Denton Adkinson are still making history. After debuting their world-class historical documentary about the famed Tuskegee Airmen at the Imperial Theatre in 2009, the two Augusta-area partners in Bryton Entertainment continue to see their work hit the big-time. It hit Walmart stores across the country in late 2011. In early 2012 the two attended the premiere of George Lucas’ Red Tails feature film on the black fighter and bomber units that distinguished themselves and their country in World War II. The cast of Red Tails had viewed Bryton’s documentary during shooting – prompting Lucas himself to write a letter of appreciation to Williams and Adkinson. In 2013, McGraw-Hill Education used a clip from Bryton’s In Their Own Words: The Tuskegee Airmen to inspire departing high school seniors in some 20 states. Last March, the documentary was screened in more than 200 theaters nationwide. Then just recently, on Sept. 18 – the anniversary of the birth of the U.S. Air Force – the film was aired on the worldwide American Forces Network, serving some 1 million members of the armed forces, their families and civilian support staff serving in some 170 countries abroad and at sea. It has, in short, become one of the most-viewed Augusta productions in memory. And it shows no signs of stopping. The documentary – which just happens to have also aired on Atlanta’s WSB-TV last Sunday – is currently being syndicated to television affiliates across the country for airing in early 2017. National sponsors are currently being sought to underwrite the broadcasts. Those advertisers would be wise to jump aboard; In Their Own Words is a vital part not just of African-American history, but of American history. As we wrote last April, the Tuskegee Airmen broke the racial barrier – then helped break the back of the Nazi war machine. One of their missions included a little-heralded Doolittle-style long-range raid on Berlin. Sadly, as you can imagine, they came home to a welcome wholly unbefitting veterans and war heroes. The good news is, they’ve been increasingly cited and honored in recent years, and some have blessedly been here to witness it. And their story lives on in an Augusta-area documentary whose audience continues to grow. Filmmakers Williams and Adkinson ultimately hope to get a form of the documentary into schools across the country, perhaps with accompanying curriculum materials to bring the story alive for generations to come. The two have been neck-deep in other projects as well, including promotions for the new Ronald McDonald House in Augusta. And with Adkinson as director of photography, Bryton had a big hand in the documentary film Happy, about Augusta artist Leonard “Porkchop” Zimmerman, and his emotional “Happy” art project that has seen his minimalist-but-merry robot portrait pop up on streets on several continents. That film, too, is growing in audience and exposure, having been accepted to the Milwaukee Film Festival, Savannah Film Festival and the Chelsea Film Festival in New York. These guys aren’t content to keep making history. They want to change the future too.

That was the story for back-to-school 2016 — a match that, while not exactly made in retail heaven, helped local stores move more merchandise than last year. But because of steep price cuts, a 3.2 percent bump in transactions didn’t result in overall sales growth compared with last year. In fact, sales at stores across New York state slid 0.2 percent from 2015 levels, despite the easy comparisons against disastrously weak results last year, according to payments processing firm First Data. “The number of swipes grew at a robust rate — it’s just that people are shopping more for discounted goods compared to a year ago,” said Rishi Chhabra, First Data vice president of information and analytics. New Yorkers had bargains galore to choose from as stores, including Walmart and Target, relentlessly hyped deep discounts and rolled out new technology to encourage shopping in-store, online on home computers or on mobile devices. While unemployment has declined since the Great Recession, many New Yorkers are still scraping by with too little income. Perhaps that’s why used clothing stores were the big winner in New York in July and August, with a 7.7 percent sales gain. Other standouts were cosmetic retailers, up 7.3 percent, and sports apparel stores, with a 6.6 percent gain. Losers included men’s clothing stores, down 6 percent, and shoe stores, with a 5.9 percent drop, First Data said. Nationwide, back-to-school sales grew 1.1 percent. Continuing to corral market share from brick-and-mortar stores, e-commerce sales climbed 10 percent. However, even e-commerce logged a slower growth rate than last year, while the Commerce Department’s core retail sales for August failed to meet economists’ expectations of a slight gain, instead slipping 0.1 percent from July. Ahead of the all-important holiday selling season, savvy local retailers are letting customers choose from an ever-widening array of online and in-store shopping and shipping combinations — while trying to reestablish a trip through the brick-and-mortar doors as a fun alternative to that omnipresent mobile phone screen. Downtown children’s clothing and furniture chain Babesta logged modest back-to-school sales gains, but revenue jumped sharply during a recent “wine and juice boxes” event, complete with black-and-white cookies echoing the palette of gender-neutral clothing collection Nununu. “Retailers have to step up their game and deliver something exceptional,” said owner Jennifer Cattaui.

The outdoor venue seats 7,000 and the concert was posted as being sold out according to the AMP’s website. The trio released a single “Ophelia”  which is trending #1 for the fifth consecutive week on Adult Album Alternative (AAA) radio charts, following “Ho Hey” and “Stubborn Love.” Both singles from their debut album spent weeks as radio chart toppers and “Ophelia” is quickly following in their footsteps. AAA is not the only format that the band is finding success with, as the single is also currently trending Top 10 on Alternative radio. On Monday (Oct. 3) President Barack Obama has invited them to perform on the South Lawn of the White House.

(KOIN) Related Coverage Brown calls endorsing Measure 97 a “difficult decision” Could corporate tax put Powell’s out of business? PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) — Supporters of a corporate tax proposal went door-to-door Saturday, urging citizens to vote “yes” on the measure come November. But opponents say they’re also working hard to inform people about negative impacts of the proposed tax. The Yes on 97 campaign told KOIN 6 News their goal is talk with more than 400,000 voters before election day arrives. “The great thing about this ballot measure, you have to do $25 million in sales… and these are the Walmarts and the Chevrons,” Yes on 97 campaign press secretary Katherine Dreissen said. “They already pay more taxes in other parts of the country.” If the measure passes, it would levy a 2.5% tax on the gross sales receipts of businesses with more than $25 million in annual sales. The intention is for the money to fund health care, education and senior services. But some opponents said they’re concerned businesses will end up passing on the increased cost to consumers. They’re also worried it could result in job cuts. “It’s a sales tax in sheep’s clothing,” one voter said. Employees at Gresham Ford said they’re concerned the tax will lead to an increase in car prices, which would make them less competitive with Washington dealerships.

COMICS   •   MOVIES   •   MUSIC   •   TELEVISION   •   GAMES   •   BOOKS Album Review: National Lampoon Presents: Are There Any Triggers Here Tonight? By BAADASSSSS!   |   Thursday, September 29th, 2016 at 1:00 pm Tweet Are There Any Triggers Here Tonight? iTunes | CD Baby The Final Edition | NL Release Date: September 9, 2016 National Lampoon has certainly seen better days; a few decades before they became a brand synonymous with puerile, sophomoric frat boy humor and cheap direct-to-video “comedies,” the Lampoon was a brain trust of America’s boldest and most fearless young satirists who used their incisive, inventive wit to offend, compel, and amuse and who would lay the foundation for some of the great works of modern comedy, from the small screen success of Saturday Night Live to the celluloid classics Caddyshack, Ghostbusters, and This is Spinal Tap. As the company slowly evolved into a multimedia empire, they lost their edge. Now they exist solely because ten Wal-Mart customers demand movies where they can enjoy lamebrain toilet humor and Vida Guerra’s naked breasts without having to change the DVD. Two years after the National Lampoon magazine launched, editor and writer Tony Hendra teamed up with the great Michael O’Donoghue to create the company’s first comedy album, Radio Dinner. Hendra later helped put together the Lampoon’s off-Broadway smash Lemmings, which featured comedic giants John Belushi, Chevy Chase, and Christopher Guest in breakout performances that kick-started their own amazing careers. Are There Any Triggers Here Tonight? is the first album by The Final Edition, a satirical troupe founded by Hendra and Jeff Kreisler, and is appropriately presented by National Lampoon no doubt as part of a belated attempt to recapture a bit of their former reputation. Triggers is a sketch-heavy effort that takes the form of a live show being staged before a crowd of increasingly hostile college students who seem to find something offensive about every single skit performed by The Final Edition. No one in the group, among them Hendra himself (he’s the chap with the British accent, dear boy), can understand what the fuss is about considering the skits feature excerpts from a sex tape starring former Democratic presidential hopeful Senator Bernie Sanders, an interview with Kim Kardashian’s ass, a couple dining at a restaurant that specializes in rectal feeding (in an effort to disprove the C.I.A.’s use of the technique isn’t torture), a woman’s uncomfortable encounter with an abortion doctor required by law to make her hesitant to pursue the procedure by any means legally necessary, representatives of ISIS defiantly trying to prove to the world that they’re not gay, and much more. Equal parts crude, lewd, gross, and caustically humorous, Triggers is a valiant yet frustratingly scattershot attempt to expose a new generation of comedy fans to the type of take-no-prisoners humor that electrified the youth of America in the days of the Vietnam War, Watergate, and the brief but horrific rule over the nation’s pop culture landscape by the Pet Rock. The 44-minute album also takes aim at police corruption and brutality, the aggressive security methods employed by the Transportation Security Administration, and anti-gay politicians who will stoop to the lowest lows imaginable to change the laws in order to satisfy their agenda and base. The writing is mostly smart and stays on target, but sketches about Enya’s music and the cocaine habit developed by Elmo after Sesame Street moves to HBO overstay their welcome and are rather pointless and forgettable. Although the album’s structure and format was inspired by that of National Lampoon’s Radio Dinner, it rarely goes for their subjects’ throats and balls the way the Lampoon’s finest comedic minds used to do with manic gusto and depraved genius. Triggers‘ primary target is the tendency of contemporary audiences to become overly sensitive at the very mention of certain topics, and yet the people in The Final Edition don’t really give anyone much to find offensive here because there is precious little to be found on this album that one might possibly consider provocative or at the very least original. I laughed some during Are There Any Triggers Here Tonight?, but the Final Edition’s attempt to break into the comedy album market can’t help but be a little late to the party when up-to-the-moment humorists and comedians on television and the Internet have already ripped into the same subject matter with greater candor and imagination. Still though, there’s a lot more hilarity to be found on Triggers than in an entire season of the current Saturday Night Live. The spirit of the Lampoon lives on even as the company itself has tried to snuff it out permanently in the name of greed and establishing brand recognition.

The bizarre scheme of Eduardo Dejesus Cossio III, 32, involved him purchasing beer at Target and Walmart stores in Eastlake, Chula Vista, National City, and elsewhere and then returning it with bottles filled with cleaning solution. He would apparently drink the beer and place cleaning solutions and soap in the bottles and return them for refunds. He would glue the caps back on the bottles and it appeared to be unopened. Court records say other customers would buy the tainted beer and then discover the beer had been tampered with. Target stores looked at their security tapes and records and discovered it was Cossio repeatedly returning beer to get refunds in 2014 and 2015. Target employees identified Cossio as he wore a distinctive pair of earrings, beard, and hair style in store security tapes. He filled out the refund records with his correct name, date of birth, and driver’s license number. San Diego Police officers discovered glue sticks, glue guns, cleaning solutions, and dye bottles at his home. Records don’t say if anyone was harmed. He pleaded guilty to returning adulterated beverages to the Target store at 910 Eastlake Parkway, and at 2911 Jamacha Road in El Cajon. Charges involving 29 similar counts were dismissed. Cossio will be sentenced Oct. 7 in San Diego Superior Court. He faces a sentence of one year in jail and has agreed to pay restitution. The maximum sentence is four years and four months in prison.

Proclaimed in Massachusetts by Governor Charlie Baker, and recognized annually on October 1st by the United Nations and World Health Organization, International Day of Older Persons celebrates the important contributions of older adults and raises awareness toward issues of aging, with particular focus this year on “Taking a Stand Against Ageism,” including discrimination, misconceptions and stereotypes about older adults and aging. This day encourages the promotion of a positive image and social inclusion of older adults as they age to better understand their experiences and needs and celebrate their societal contributions. With over 600 million persons aged 60 years and over expected to double by 2025 and reach two billion by 2050, a demographic revolution is underway worldwide, including in Greater Boston where the population of adults aged 60+ increased by 11% from 2000-2010 and that by 2030 one in five Boston residents will be age 60+. As this population grows, LBFE’s mission in Greater Boston is to alleviate isolation and loneliness in older adults, with the support of staff and over 1,500 volunteers who provide companionship, support and care to over 800 elders aged 70 and over without the benefit of family or adequate social contacts. LBFE’s mission is accomplished through a variety of initiatives, including individual home visits, city site partnerships where elders are brought together to meet their neighbors, on call services such as medical escorts, and nutritional programming including an emergency food pantry, grocery distribution and holiday luncheons around Thanksgiving and the winter holidays. LBFE’s nutritional programming were recently bolstered by a $25,000 grant from the Walmart Foundation’s State Giving Program. LBFE is welcoming volunteers for events and programs throughout October and at our upcoming holiday luncheons. Volunteers interested in the below opportunities or getting involved in our daily programs should visit www.littlebrothersboston.org or contact boston@littlebrothers.org for more information. October 1st – October 9th: “Marjorie Prime” with Nora Theatre Company Support our Community Partnership with the Nora Theatre Company’s production of “Marjorie Prime” and a 15% discount with the promotion code LITTLEBROTHERS. The production is a thought provoking look at family life, aging and the role of memory loss and technology. October 1st: Intergenerational Art Class, Creating Talismans Join our volunteer artist, Elle Marrone, at 70 St. Botolph St from 3-6pm. Participants will have the space to make their own beaded jewelry/adornments based on their specific identity and the physical products will be empowering. This workshop is accessible and open to people ages 10-100–the intergenerational aspect is important as it will take place in an elder/disabled home. Saturday, October 8th: Friendship and Flowers Named for our motto, flowers before bread, which reflects our belief living is more than a roof over our heads and food on the table, but shared interaction and laughter, you’ll be given the names of our elder partners in nearby assisted living facility for a friendly visit, following a brief orientation at our headquarters in Jamaica Plain.

Photo by Roberto Rodriguez The Schnucks store at Ballwin Plaza Decades ago, people shopped for food at the grocery store, period. Now they can buy ingredients for tonight’s dinner or tomorrow’s breakfast at convenience stores, discount superstores, drugstores or warehouse clubs, or they can shop online. The supermarket industry itself has become crowded with competitors ranging from discounters such as Aldi to high-end specialty stores such as Whole Foods. Add in a nine-month-long trend of falling food prices, the second-longest stretch of grocery deflation since 1960, and you have an unprecedented level of challenges for middle-market chains such as Schnuck Markets, whose largest union took a strike vote last week. I’m not taking sides in the talks between Schnucks and United Food and Commercial Workers Local 655, but clearly the venerable St. Louis chain is under a lot of pressure. When prices of the goods on your shelves are falling, it’s hard to cover even a modest increase in operating costs. In a statement issued after Monday’s strike vote, Chief Executive Todd Schnuck said his company faces “explosive growth” in competition. He counts 719 stores selling food in the St. Louis area, of which 584 are nonunion. Schnucks’ two biggest unionized competitors, Shop ’n Save and Dierbergs, also are negotiating contracts with Local 655. Wal-Mart Stores was a relatively new threat in 2003, the last time local supermarket workers went on strike. Now it’s by far the area’s largest grocery merchant, and plenty of other newcomers are nibbling away at the traditional supermarket chains. Dollar stores added refrigeration and expanded their grocery offerings. Aldi made an expansion push and Kroger opened nine of its deep-discount Ruler Foods stores here. Stores such as Lucky’s Market and Fresh Thyme filled niches. All this choice is being driven by a change in consumer behavior, says Susan Viamari, vice president of thought leadership at market research firm IRI. While shoppers of yesteryear bought most of their groceries on a weekly stock-up trip, today’s consumers pick up items on frequent fill-in trips. That trend accelerated during the recession, when consumers were too cash-strapped to buy a week’s groceries all at once. It has persisted, and Viamari says shoppers have become savvy about seeking deals on items they buy frequently. “It is happening quickly, but it has a profound impact on how grocery retailers market to the consumer,” she said. “Everyone is scrambling a bit. … There is a battle for share of stomach going on.” See how much St. Louis CEOs were paid Here are the best large places to work in St. Louis Meet the best small businesses to work at in St. Louis Public pay: Government and teacher salaries for St. Louis area In such a fragmented market, grocers’ marketing challenges are tougher than they used to be. “These are targeted trips,” Viamari says. “Shoppers are very informed, and to a degree shoppers are in control.” Workers, on the other hand, must feel like they have less control than ever. Union members reportedly are unhappy with the raise they’re being offered and with higher health care premiums, but they won’t have a job if the stores can’t make money. Supermarket margins have always been thin, and they’re being eroded by deflation and intensified competition. Supervalu, Shop ’n Save’s publicly traded parent company, has seen its share price halved in the last 18 months. Even tougher competition may be on the horizon. Amazon offers same-day grocery delivery in only a handful of cities now, but CEO Jeff Bezos wants to conquer food the same way he conquered books, diapers and other categories. Bezos famously says, in reference to competing retailers, “Your margin is my opportunity.” If he ever brings AmazonFresh to St. Louis, local supermarkets and their workers will learn the bitter truth of that aphorism.

By Steve Twedt / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Insurers are largely holding the course with their Medicare Advantage offerings for 2017, as details on the plans were released today for seniors to review before the annual open enrollment period begins Oct. 15. Highmark, with 182,877 Medicare Advantage members in western Pennsylvania, will once again be offering nine Medicare Advantage plans for 2017, with minimal or no premium increases. All of the plans include dental, vision and hearing aid coverage with no annual deductible. UPMC Health Plan, which has 121,000 members in the region, is staying with its offerings of four HMO and two PPO options, too, with a new feature: members in its HMO plans will have full in-network coverage while staying in Florida. “We have a lot of members go down there for the winter,” said John Lovelace, president of government programs for UPMC Health Plan. “It has been kind of a hold back for people.” The most notable change for Highmark is the roll out of a preferred pharmacy network for two plans, Community Blue Medicare HMO Signature and Security Blue HMO ValueRx. Those members will see lower or no cost for prescriptions filled at one of the network pharmacies. For example, a member in those plans might pay nothing for some generic medications at a network pharmacy but, if they want to stay with a pharmacy not in that network, they might face a $5 co-payment. “We are always looking at ways we can help the members from a choice and price perspective,” said Lori Rund, vice president of senior markets at Highmark. Major pharmacies in the preferred network include Walgreens, Rite Aid and Wal-Mart as well as Costco and Kmart, but not CVS. Ms. Rund said their two Community Blue plans, which exclude UPMC physicians and hospitals, remain their most popular offerings. The Signature Community Blue plan will again carry no premium and no co-payment for primary care physician visits. There is a $50 co-payment to see a specialist and a $300 daily co-payment for in-patient hospital stays. The Prestige Community Blue plan has a $199 monthly premium, up $6 from this year, with a $100 co-payment per hospital admission. Ms. Lund said premiums and co-payments are “up slightly” for its four Security Blue HMO plans. The basic plan has a $60 premium but does not include prescription coverage. Premiums for the other three are $71 for the Value Rx plan which does include prescriptions; $207.50 for the Standard plan; and $274.50 for the Deluxe plan which offers more enhanced coverage. Similarly, the three Freedom Blue PPO plans show minimal or no increases, with premiums for Value Rx going from $79.50 this year to $81 in 2017; the Select Plan premium going from $174.50 to $176; and the Classic plan premium goes down from $299 this year to $297 in 2017. All Highmark plans have a yearly maximum out-of-pocket cost of $6,700. UPMC Health Plan’s four HMO and two PPO plans next year will provide full in-network access to UPMC facilities and physicians as well as most community hospitals, while expanding its service area into the Steubenville, Ohio, area. UPMC for Life HMO Deductible with prescription plan, the insurer’s most popular plan, will keep its $22 monthly premium and the premium for UPMC for Life HMO Rx will stay at $83. There will be a $13 a month increase to $255 for the UPMC for Life Rx Enhanced Plan. UPMC for Life also offers a zero premium plan with no prescription drug coverage. For its PPO products, UPMC for Life PPO Rx Enhanced plan will have a monthly premium of $137, a $15 decrease from this year, and UPMC for Life PPO High Deductible with Rx plan will carry a $37 premium, $7 less than this year. Most plans include preventive dental coverage, with a $15 co-payment for twice yearly exams and cleanings and a $15 co-payment for one yearly bitewing x-ray. Yearly out-of-pocket maximum costs for the UPMC HMO plans range from $3,400 to $4,000 and its PPO plans have a $6,700 maximum. Two other insurers offer plans for those enrolling in Medicare Advantage, which is administered by private insurers under contract with Medicare. According to its website, United Healthcare, with 8,500 members in western Pennsylvania, is offering three HMO Medicare Advantage plans in our region, AARP Medicare Complete Plans 1, 2 and 3, with monthly premiums ranging from a low of $16 for Plan 1 to $86 for Plan 3. Plan 1 has a $10 co-payment for an office visit with your primary care physician and a $40 co-payment to see a specialist while Plan 3 has no co-payment for the office visit and a $30 co-payment for a specialist. All three plans include prescription coverage. Steve Twedt: stwedt@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1963. Related Media: Should drug costs be controlled by regulating industry as a public utility?

(Doreen Christensen) Doreen ChristensenContact ReporterSun Sentinel Doreen's Deals: Save on fall cosmetics with these beauty hacks and drugstore swaps Privacy Policy Cosmetics are my weakness. I'm a sucker for the latest look and I've got a big shoebox filled with half-used products to prove it. As the seasons change, women freshen beauty bags and empty wallets in the process. Globally, we spend more than $425 billion on face creams, lipstick and such. This explains the explosion of beauty retailers like Sephora, Ulta and South Florida-based GBS Beauty moving in on department-store turf. Walmart, Target, Bed Bath & Beyond and other mass retailers continue to expand beauty offerings, too. Beauty might be big business, but you don't need to break the bank to look good. Recently I stopped in at Ulta Beauty and, as usual, walked out a poorer woman than when I entered, but with the promise of flawless skin. I bought Benefit's The POREfessional Face Primer for $31 and other odds and ends I couldn't live without. The bill was $79. While I was happy with my purchase, I returned to Ulta to see if I could find a cheaper, comparable product in the name of journalistic research. It cost me another $43. A manager introduced me to NYX, a brand I had barely glanced at, which is favored by makeup artists for its huge range of on-trend products and low prices. A tester revealed NYX Pore Filler, $13.99, to be indistinguishable from the Benefit product I'd purchased earlier, except it was $17 cheaper.

Sign up to get a free fall beauty box full of seasonal products from Walmart for $5 in shipping. Beauty Boxes come four times a year stuffed with eight to 10 trial- and full-sized products from name-brands including Secret, Olay, L'Oreal, Rimmel,  Dove, Neutrogena, TreSemme, Cover Girl and others.... (Doreen Christensen) That's why I like shopping at Ulta. The store carries prestige products once only found in department stores, along with mass-market brands carried by drugstores. That makes it easy to use testers and compare ingredients on labels to get the best bang for beauty bucks. Stores also accept returns (80 percent of the product must remain) for up to 60 days. Add Ulta coupons, manufacturer coupons and reward points and you're really sittin' pretty. Slick marketing and flirty packaging have always lured me into spending more than I intended. It's time to stop buying into the hype and go cheap. A few corporate conglomerates own nearly every brand, so it stands to reason the premium and cheaper products have similar formulations in different packaging. Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) owns Christian Dior, Benefit, Make Up For Ever, Marc Jacobs and Sephora stores. Estee Lauder owns Clinique, Smashbox, Origins, Mac, Aveda, Bobby Brown, Le Mer and Tom Ford. Shiseido owns Bare Minerals, Nars and Buxom. L'Oreal owns Lancom, Maybelline, NYX, Urban Decay, Giorgio Armani and YSL. Coty owns CoverGirl, MaxFactor, Rimmel and NYC. Revlon owns Almay. Johnson & Johnson owns Neutrogena.

Use a coupon to get an Invati Exfoliating Shampoo, Thickening Conditioner and Scalp Reviatalizer at participating locations. The Invati 3-step thickening system promises to reduce hair loss by 33 percent. You also can redeem the offer... (Doreen Christensen) Any new brand not owned by one of the biggies will likely be gobbled up, as was the case with It Cosmetics. In July, L'Oreal bought the company for $1.2 billion. Again, with a B. Cosmetics are a real racket. Market research companies estimate products are marked up 78 percent. Slick packaging, manipulative advertising and celebrity endorsements brainwash us to believe that expensive equals better. So, instead of spending $74 on Lancome Renergie Lift Multi-Action Eye, make a drugstore swap for sister brand L'Oreal Age Perfect Eye Renewal for $25. Compare labels. Both contain mostly water and silicone oil, and have many other ingredients in common. My multi-store survey revealed wide price differences on mass-market brands, too. Bed Bath & Beyond, with more than its many aisles of beauty and personal-care products, tended to be cheaper than CVS and Walgreens. You can pump up savings by stacking the store's 20-percent-off coupon with manufacturer coupons on each item. (Stockpile store coupons. They're accepted even when expired.) Don't assume discount stores only peddle discontinued products, either. I found excellent prices at Marshall's, especially on premium products. Clinique Even Better Dark Spot Corrector was $50. It's $80 in department stores. StriVectin eye and neck creams were on clearance for $10 to $15. They retail for $95. Essie nail polish, Maybelline and L'Oreal mascaras were $3.99 each. All retail for at least twice that. Take a closer look at house brands at GBS, Ulta and Sephora as well as value products from NYX, e.l.f., Physicians Formula and Essence. They're all going to end up in the shoebox anyway.

 Shopping at Walmart is getting a lot cheaper Hayley Peterson Sep. 28, 2016, 9:24 AM 14,608 facebook linkedin twitter email print A Walmart Supercenter in Arkansas. Thomson Reuters Grocery prices are in a free-fall.  Food prices have declined for nine straight months in the US, marking one of the longest stretches of food deflation in 50 years. We went to Walmart to find out just how far prices have fallen at the No. 1 grocery store in the US. We compared the prices of 34 items at a store in Richmond, Virginia on Tuesday to the prices of the same items at the same store in December 2015. The result? The basket of groceries is now 10% cheaper than it was nine months ago.  The basket total in September was $104.17. In December 2015, the same items cost $114.86.  Some of the products' package sizes have changed over the last year, so we calculated those differences into the final price. We found the biggest price drops among the eggs (down 67% to 82 cents for one dozen eggs); goat cheese (down 56% to $1.99 for 4 ounces); pineapples (down 41% to $1.75 per fruit); almonds (down 37% to $5.13 for 12 ounces); peanut butter (down 28% to $3.14 for 40 ounces); and extra virgin olive oil (down 23% to $2.98 for 17 fluid ounces).  The prices of ground beef and chicken also fell considerably, dropping 8% and 11% respectively. Some items cost considerably more than in December 2015, such as 2-liter bottles of Coca-Cola (up to $1.48 from $1 per bottle in December) and canola oil (up to $2.88 for a 48-fluid-ounce bottle from $1.98 in December).  It's possible Walmart increased prices on those items to offset the plunging costs of meat, poultry, fish, and eggs. Since August 2015, prices of those items have dropped 6.5%, representing the biggest drop of any food group in that period, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, Walmart denied that it prices products according to trends between food categories.

 Everything you know about millennial spending is about to change Ashley Lutz Oct. 1, 2016, 9:27 AM 13,442 facebook linkedin twitter email print Shutterstock Millennials are becoming parents — and it's creating shockwaves in the retail, restaurant, automotive, and home-buying industries.  The 18- to 35-year-old generation is notorious for renting homes instead of buying, spending on experiences over apparel, and dining at restaurants instead of at home.  But that's starting to change as more millennials become parents. More than 60 million millennials — about 80% of the generation — will become parents in the next decade, according to a study by marketing platform Crowdtap. Millennials currently spend $170 billion a year and are projected to spend $200 billion annually starting in 2017 and $10 trillion in their lifetimes, according to a study by Exponential. Millennials are becoming parents — they're just doing it later than previous generations.   This chart using Wells Fargo data shows how the average age of first marriage and childbirth is rising in the US.  Business Insider/Wells Fargo Once people have kids, they usually trade in happy hours and vacations for houses and cars.  This chart by JPMorgan shows that millennial spending is fairly similar to older generations. As they increasingly become parents, spending on categories like home improvement are expected to rise.  JPMorgan Shifting attitudes toward lodging and transportation Millennials have long said in surveys that they want to own homes like their parents, as Business Insider's Bob Bryan recently reported. Even those living in their parents' basements have expressed their intent to get their own place. KB Homes CEO Jeffrey Mezger said in a recent earnings call that first-time home buyers and young people are beginning to enter the market, driving demand to his business.  Millennials are also buying more cars.  The largest generation in the US bought 4 million cars and trucks last year, according to the Associated Press. Their share of the new-car market was at a record 28%.  New winners in the fast-food industry Their habits as parents are also influencing the restaurant and fast-food industries.  Traditional fast-food chains are losing market share to up-and-coming establishments like Panera Bread as millennial customers search for healthier options.   This shift in consumer mindsets puts Starbucks in a unique position to take over, according to a 2015 report by Goldman Sachs. "Starbucks is virtually the only large incumbent that can offer millennial parents the convenience of a (fast-food chain) and food they would not feel guilty/embarrassed to feed to their kids," Goldman Sachs' analysts write. McDonald's recently retooled its McNuggets recipe to eliminate preservatives. Thomson Reuters Starbucks has been expanding its menu to include more food options such as sandwiches and salads. It has also added drive-thrus to many locations.  The coffee chain has also been "steadily expanding kid-friendly snack options, such as organic fruit squeezes, organic food snacks, and organic Greek yogurt," according to Goldman Sachs.  But McDonald's, Chick-fil-A, Wendy's, and others are trying to catch up by eliminating preservatives in food and offering more healthy and organic options.   Grocery stores make a change  Companies like Target, Walmart, and Kroger are making changes to appeal to millennial moms, who tend to do most of the shopping for their households. Target's CEO has been traveling around the country visiting the homes of millennial moms to better understand how they shop. Walmart and Kroger have been offering wider selections of organic foods, which are important to the health-conscious generation. Kroger has also been expanding its private-label products so it can offer cheaper prices.  Whole Foods is opening a new chain of stores to better appeal to millennial moms, who crave convenience and well-organized aisles.  The company's new 365 stores will be much smaller than regular stores, offer lower prices, and cater to more technology-savvy consumers. Reuters Traditional apparel chains struggle, athletic retailers win "The fashion industry has undergone one of the most dramatic makeovers in recent history — no doubt influenced by the millennial consumer," said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at NPD.  While US consumers spent slightly more on apparel, footwear, and accessories in 2014, those increases were driven by the new "athleisure" trend, not by traditional retailers like Macy's, NPD says.  While previous generations dressed up for work and play, millennials have a tendency to wear brands like Nike, Under Armour, and Lululemon everywhere, according to NPD.  "There is an underlying sense of rebellion that comes through in today’s fashion," Cohen said.  While department and discount stores struggle, business for athletic retailers is booming. Cohen says that traditional retailers will have to evolve to newly casual consumers.  "This is no longer a trend — it is now a lifestyle that is too comfortable, for consumers of all ages, for it to go away anytime soon," he said.  It's likely millennials will pass their fashion preferences on to their children too.  Hayley Peterson contributed to this story.  SEE ALSO: Millennials reveal 100 brands they love Follow Us: On Facebook NOW WATCH: What this symbol that’s on nearly half of your food actually means Loading video...

Daniel Miller (TMFTwoCoins) Oct 1, 2016 at 7:44AM A fragmented industry is one that has no major players that heavily influence business practices. That doesn't mean these industries are small because there are many examples of the opposite: such as the U.S. trucking industry where many mom and pop operations make great money within the $700 billion industry.  Despite the fact that fragmented industries devoid of any Wal-Mart sized whales, there are advantages to being a medium sized fish in a pond filled with guppies. With this in mind, here are two dividend stocks with upside as they continue to thrive in their fragmented industries. Diamonds are forever Image source: Getty Images. Signet Jewelers (NYSE:SIG) owns a host of brands and brick-and-mortar stores in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. that investors will likely recognize. Those brands include Jared, Kay, and Zale, among other regional brands. Signet operates in a highly fragmented jewelry industry and has become the largest seller of affordable diamond, gold, and silver jewelry in the United States. Over time it has acquired smaller companies and driven consolidation in an industry that has a plethora of sole proprietors, entrepreneurs, and single-location retailers. This offers investors of Signet a couple of advantages. First, thanks to being the largest player in a fragmented industry, it can use its scale and purchasing power as leverage to lower costs for its diamonds and other jewelry products -- something smaller competitors can't do. Another perk of Signet being the largest player, with the largest balance sheet, is that it can offer its customers something smaller competitors typically can't: financing options. Signet offers its bridal and engagement jewelry on credit and that offers a significant advantage as consumers unable to purchase without financing gravitate toward Signet's stores. This scenario plays out quite often as more than half of Signet's diamond sales are bought on short-term credit. Despite its advantages, Signet isn't immune to retail weakness which has plagued brick-and-mortar retailers in many industries recently, and that reared its ugly head during the second-quarter when Signet missed estimates. Further, with the recent Brexit vote completed and the U.K. opting out of the European Union it could present headwinds for the company's U.K. business. SIG data by YCharts. Those two factors have sent the company's stock price plunging year-to-date, but it could also offer investors a great time to start a small position in a company that will likely bounce back and continue to take advantage of its size in a fragmented industry. Everybody loves a good network effect Image source: Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers. Similar to Signet Jewelers, Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers (NYSE:RBA) is a leader in a highly fragmented industry. More specifically, RBA is the largest auction company of used heavy-equipment and machinery via its industrial auctions. The company appraises, sells, inspects, buys, refurbishes, ships, and helps finance these specialized heavy equipment for businesses operating in construction, mining, transportation, and agriculture, among other industries -- and it does this globally. The intriguing part about RBA as an investment is that, in my opinion, the company has a strong competitive advantage thanks to its network effect. Because the heavy-equipment auction industry is highly fragmented, sellers and buyers gravitate to RBA because it's the largest player. It's a virtuous cycle where more sellers equates to more product, and more product equates to more interested buyers, which attracts more sellers -- on and on the virtuous cycle goes. Despite being the largest player, RBA recently made a move to significantly squash competition trying to follow in its footsteps. Earlier this month RBA announced it would acquire IronPlanet in a deal worth nearly $760 million and the news initially sent its stock price soaring 23%. What many investors don't realize, though, is that IronPlanet was an online-based auctioneer that was innovating its way to success digitally -- something that RBA was focusing its efforts on recently. Also, IronPlanet was one of RBA's few competitors that had anything resembling the scale necessary to compete. RBA effectively took one of, if not its largest, competitive threat and brought it in house to improve its scale, network effect, and online ambitions. That's a home run acquisition in my book. Morningstar estimates that despite being the world's largest auction company it only represents about 4% of the $100 billion used-equipment auction market. That leaves a huge runway for growth if the company can continue to handpick home-run acquisitions, leverage its scale, and grow its online presence.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Instead of trucks on the road or drones in the sky, the Starship Technologies delivery robot boosts safety and efficiency by sticking to the sidewalks.

The grocery delivery startup was considered "high-tech" because you could order groceries on a website and have them delivered. A darling of the late '90s dot-com boom, WebVan ultimately failed, becoming a poster child for the dot-com bust (the company went bankrupt in 2001) and a cautionary tale about the perils of so-called "last-mile" delivery -- the link in the supply chain that brings products to consumers. Delivery is expensive and inefficient. Unlike most parts of the supply chain, the last mile doesn't scale, especially when a human employee drives a big car to bring one product to one consumer. The "last mile" is ripe for disruption. But how? Companies like Google and Amazon are trying. Google Express picks up goods at stores and delivers them to homes using route-optimization algorithms. Google Express competes against Amazon's AmazonFresh grocery delivery service, which costs a whopping $299 per year -- and that's from a company famous for free delivery of regular packages. (AmazonFresh is for groceries and should not be confused with recent reports that Amazon is working on its own shipping service for nongrocery packages to compete with FedEx and UPS.) Peapod, Fresh Direct, Whole Foods and others are also trying to make grocery delivery work. But none of these companies has really solved the last-mile delivery problem. It's still too slow and expensive. So what's the solution? Drones, right? When Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos revealed his company's drone initiative on 60 minutes in 2013, the world was incredulous. Since then, Google and other tech companies, along with Wal-Mart and other retailers as well as numerous delivery companies like UPS, have unveiled drone-delivery experiments, plans and trials. So the public can be forgiven for believing that the future of last-mile delivery is all about drones. But drones don't scale: They can't fly that far, can't carry that much and need to have their batteries recharged frequently. While drones are great for bringing high-value items (like medicine) to remote places, they're not great for everyday deliveries. The good news is that last-mile delivery can, in fact, scale. Several companies are already testing and showcasing technologies that could make that happen. The rolling drone-base idea Auto giant Mercedes-Benz recently rolled out a delivery concept that combines truck and drone delivery with robotic in-truck warehousing. Mercedes' so-called Vision Van, which was created in partnership with a drone startup called Matternet, is an all-electric warehouse on wheels. Two internal racks, which are loaded with packages in the warehouse, are placed in the van. A robotic system grabs the right package based on the next delivery and hands it to the driver through a window while he's still in the driver's seat. Alternatively, the robot system can push the package through a window in the ceiling and into the "arms" of one of two rooftop drones, which then delivers the package to the customer's backyard. This enables faster delivery to homes that are far from the road, and makes it possible for two or three packages to be delivered at once (one by the driver and two by the drones). Another use for the drone port is to deliver a package to the driver that was ordered for same-day delivery after the driver left the warehouse. The robotic in-van warehousing system increases efficiency and cuts down on errors, theoretically. The launching of the drones from vans, rather than from the warehouse, cuts way down on the battery problem. Taken further, you could imagine the rolling drone-base idea leading to large trucks rolling into neighborhoods and then dispatching a fleet of drones, delivery bots and humans to deliver many packages at once. The self-driving ice chest idea An Estonian company called Starship Technologies makes a robot that looks like an ice chest on wheels for delivering packages and food autonomously or semi-autonomously. Starship co-founder Ahti Heinla, who was one of the original creators of Skype, told me that his delivery robot is inherently safe because it's light and slow (4 mph) and has software that causes it to get out of the way and stop when pedestrians are close. It's also safe because the robot is supervised remotely by humans, who can take over if the robot can't manage. In 8,000 miles of testing, the robots have "encountered" more than 1 million pedestrians and haven’t injured anyone, according to Heinla.

William Eugene Dillard, 33, was arrested on counterfeiting and theft charges Thursday in Seymour. Police got a call about a theft at Walmart and then stopped a vehicle matching the one described in the theft. Officers searched Dillard’s vehicle and found several bags that contained evidence of printed counterfeit money, supplies to print counterfeit money, such as paper and printing cartridges, and homemade counterfeit money templates, according to police. Dillard gave the Jackson County jail a home address in Franklin, but told Seymour police he had been living in the area for several weeks, police said.

Kevin Kennedy, KPNX 10:26 PM. MST September 30, 2016 The Scary Peeper peers through a window. (Photo: Kevin Kennedy/12 News) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST PHOENIX - Halloween costumes and decorations are already on store shelves across the Phoenix area. There are witches and goblins, pirates and skeletons hanging on racks from Walmart to Target. Even clothing and construction stores offer Halloween decorations. Home Depot is typically a store you’d buy a rake or a shovel, maybe some paint or a new barbeque but if you want to spook up your house, there are plenty of options. The only problem is that one of those decorations has been pulled off of every shelf in Canada after someone complained. The Scary Peeper peeping window prop is designed to look like a creepy man peering into the window. “First of all, my reaction to seeing it would be fear,” said Lynda Bloeser, a Halloween enthusiast. She decorates every year but feels putting something up like that is not keeping with the spirit of Halloween and sends the wrong message. “In this day and age, I do not think it is appropriate,” said Lynda Bloeser. The window decoration sells for around $30 and can still be bought at a Home Depot in the U.S. We showed the prop to several people, placing it in the window to see what they thought. “Oh my God, that is the creepiest thing I have ever seen,” said one man. Many women calling the scary decoration insensitive and in poor taste. “Oh, I would be startled if I saw it,” said Monica Goddard. Ken Baer didn’t think the window creeper was scary but felt many wouldn’t like it. “I would not say it is inappropriate, I’d just say it is a joke that some would not enjoy,” said Baer. 12 News reached out to Home Depot but was not able to talk with a supervisor. As of now, there are no plans to have it removed from shelves in the U.S. Copyright 2016 KPNX CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Flagstaff officer punches woman in the face Maricopa county only large county to vote Trump Dog DNA test shocker for Anthem family Flagstaff police FULL presser Sniper shoots man who was holding a 2-year-old hostage Could cold-blooded killers go free?

DOT will turn U.S. 401 from Purser Drive to Legend Road into a synchronized street in hopes it will ease traffic and reduce wrecks. JONATHAN M. ALEXANDER jalexander@newsobserver.com i By Jonathan M. Alexander jalexander@newsobserver.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story GARNER North Carolina Department of Transportation officials unveiled a $3 million street improvement plan expected to ease congestion and reduce wrecks along U.S. 401 in Garner. The plan proposes creating a synchronized street on the 1.4-mile stretch from Legend Road near Wake Christian Academy to Purser Drive near Walmart. Construction for the project would begin in the summer of 2020. The plan is only a temporary fix though, as N.C. DOT officials say there are plans to make a much larger improvement in the future. The current design allows side street drivers to cross over U.S. 401 when needing to make a left. However, that causes delays in traffic and more wrecks. The synchronized street design forces side street travelers who want to cross or turn left to instead turn right first, and then make a U-turn. The U-turn area is usually about 600 to 1,000 feet from the intersection. The U-turns would have signals. Five intersections at U.S. 401 were analyzed, and by 2040, all were projected to be at service levels E or F. An “F” is lowest possible service level. By 2020, U.S. 401 north of Purser Drive and Pinewinds Drive are expected to see about 48,000 trips per day. Over the last five years, there were 366 crashes from Legend Road to Purser Drive. Those crashes resulted in more than 200 injuries and two deaths. According to N.C. DOT officials, research shows that after improvements are made, crashes along that corridor are expected to decrease by 50 percent. There have been a number of projects approved by the Garner Town Council along U.S. 401 within the past year. One is a 99-acre project of townhomes, apartments and single-family homes in the McCullers Crossing area. Another project recently approved was the 660-lot Swift Creek Substation, a mixed-use development, which will be north of Eagle Ridge subdivision. Both projects are south of the street improvements. And these aren’t the only improvements being proposed for U.S. 401. N.C. DOT is also adding additional lanes from N.C. 540 to Ten Ten Road in 2019. Council member Buck Kennedy suggested N.C. DOT officials look into further street lighting on U.S. 401. N.C. DOT will be looking for input in the fall for U-turn locations and pedestrian crosswalks. N.C. DOT will first meet with property owners along the corridor, then have a public input meeting. “I really like your idea of meeting with the property owners first,” Kennedy said. “Because if it was in reverse ...” Mayor Pro-tem Kathy Behringer suggested N.C. DOT officials contact the affected property owners to let them know of the reasons for their proposals. The project is funded by the State Transportation Improvement Program. Jonathan M.

Clarke work on designs at Pyramid Atlantic Art Center in Hyattsville, Md., for their business, Copiosity, which sells internationally themed wrapping papers and greeting cards. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post) By Abha Bhattarai September 30 Follow @abhabhattarai Dianne Harrison was out jogging in 2009 when she came up with an idea for a business. The country was eking its way out of a recession. All around her, people were dealing with what seemed like a never-ending cycle of bad news. But the greeting card industry had yet to catch up. Where, she wondered, were the cards and gift wrap bearing hopeful messages that African Americans, Latinos and people of other cultures could relate to? What could she send to a friend who was battling cancer or had just been laid off? “For people who are losing homes, losing jobs, losing all kinds of things, you don’t want to say, ‘Have a good day’ with a card with a smiley on it,” Harrison, 56, said. “You want to be able to send something that recognizes the gravity of the situation but you want it to be uplifting as well.” The stay-at-home mom partnered with a friend, Cynthia M. Clarke, 58, to create Copiosity, a Silver Spring-based business that specializes in offbeat wrapping paper and cards. Six years in, the company’s products have landed in Whole Foods Markets, CVS stores and most recently, the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which sells a line of wrapping paper called “tapestries” in its gift shop. But the path to success has been a gradual one, fueled by small spurts of investments and incremental growth. The company, which expects to make about $100,000 this year, has yet to turn a profit. Harrison and Clarke remain its only employees. Copiosity is at a crossroads as Harrison and Clarke wait to hear back from a number of national chains, including Walmart, Lowe’s and Giant Foods, about whether they will stock the company’s products. It is a crucial time for the fledgling business, said Bruce Gitlin, a retired executive who works with Harrison and Clarke as part of the nonprofit Score Association, which provides mentoring for entrepreneurs. “They’re on the runway, their wheels are up and they’re close to serious takeoff velocity,” said Gitlin, a longtime Xerox executive and former chief executive of the technology firm ContentGuard. “But they’re not that far off the ground yet. They’re at a critical stage where they’ve got to gain altitude and expand the business.” The key, Gitlin said, is to secure large-scale national deals. In a business like theirs, the more volume, the better. At the beginning, for example, when Harrison and Clarke were ordering 1,000 rolls of wrapping paper at a time, they paid $1.20 per roll. Today, they pay about 80 cents apiece, with plans to sell about 60,000 rolls this holiday season. If they could scale up to about 400,000 rolls, that cost would drop to 30 cents per roll. Harrison and Clarke got started by pooling their savings, borrowing from family and friends, and running up credit card bills. It took $50,000 to create their first line of prototypes. They spent months researching the market and testing ideas. “They had an idea, but the challenge was, how do you turn that idea into a business?” Gitlin said. “Does it make sense to do this? Will people want to buy your products? It took awhile to get going.” They incorporated Copiosity in April 2010. Two-and-a-half years later, they got their break when Whole Foods Markets agreed to stock wrapping paper and gift cards at a dozen area stores. They decided to start where there was the most demand: holiday gift wrap. But instead of traditional Christmas patterns, they came up with whimsical prints such as “cracked candy canes,” as well as Kwanzaa-inspired designs in black, purple and gold. That first holiday season, they sold $12,000 worth of wrapping paper in three weeks. “We went about it in a very methodical way, developing our product, testing it for years,” Harrison said. “We’re both over 50, so we don’t have room for major mistakes. We’ve got to get this right the first time.” Today, their products are sold at 25 Whole Foods stores. The State Department and the Navy have placed orders for gift wrap. Among the company’s best sellers is Nifty Wrap, a line of wrapping paper that comes with decorative stickers and stick-on googly eyes and feathers. Rolls of gift wrap typically sell for $5 to $7, while handmade cards cost $3.50 to $12 apiece. “Typically, most designs you find in other wrapping paper are tired, boring prints that you see every year,” said Bill Gwynn, a buyer for Whole Foods’ Mid-Atlantic Region. “The designs on Copiosity’s wrapping papers feature fun, playful prints that really set them apart.” The company is testing a line of bereavement cards for children and young adults, and it has a line of 30-day journals to help people reflect on big life changes. Among its wrapping papers are prints featuring piñatas and African textiles, as well as a contemporary Hanukkah line laden with silver-and-blue stripes and polka dots. A line of color-it-yourself cards includes greetings such as “Feliz Navidad” and “Happy Kwanzaa.” Harrison and Clarke often collaborate with retailers for new products. The duo, who work out of the Pyramid Atlantic Art Center in Hyattsville, say it takes about six months to create each new design. It can take another year to 18 months for products to hit shelves. In the case of Walmart, for example, meetings began more than two years ago. Harrison and Clarke flew to the company’s Arkansas headquarters in July to present their products to buyers. They’ll meet again in October to make a final decision on products and designs. If Walmart decides that it would like to stock the company’s wrapping paper, Harrison and Clarke will design packaging that works for the store’s shelves. From there, it will take another year to manufacture the items and send them across the country, in time for next holiday season. “It’s a process,” Clarke said, adding that each retailer asks for specific tweaks based on their needs. Representatives for the home improvement chain Lowe’s, for example, told the duo to simplify their designs and scale back to two colors. Meanwhile, Ahold — the parent company of Giant Food — asked that they make their products “more ethnic.” “Our goal was to have broad appeal. Do we let Ahold go or do we try and do a couple of designs that appeal to them?” Harrison said. “That’s the question we have to answer. We haven’t decided yet.” There will be other questions to consider, too. So far, Harrison and Clarke have focused on selling to national retailers instead of individual consumers. It makes more sense, they say, to chase five- and six-figure deals than to sell wrapping paper by the roll. Eventually, that might change, which means they will have to figure out where to store excess inventory and how to ship items across the country. If it all works out — if they score a couple of big contracts and get in at Walmart — Harrison says the company could rack up $5 million in annual revenue by 2018. But after a seven-year slog to get their business off the ground, Clarke says she knows to be patient. “We spent our first three-and-a-half years doing nothing but researching the market,” she said. “We don’t have a problem taking our time.” business capitalbusiness true Please provide a valid email address.

The new state-of-the art plant was more than eight years in the planning. It took almost 12 months to construct and covers two hectares. One of the tallest buildings in Onehunga, it is located in what Managing Director Tim Nowell-Usticke calls the ‘sweet spot’ of the wine industry’s supply chain. "Here we have easy access to rail, the port, the airport, industry suppliers and supermarket distribution centres. In addition, the country’s only glassworks is just down the road, and New Zealand’s largest wine market is right on our doorstep." WineWorks and its national team of 340 staff provide services to over half the wineries in the country, through operations in Auckland, Hawke’s Bay and Marlborough. "Marlborough may be the engine room of the New Zealand wine industry, and certainly Marlborough and Hawke’s Bay are the great places to grow wine, but Auckland is where New Zealand’s wine industry was founded and where the country’s biggest wineries are headquartered. We need to be here." Tim says the Auckland plant is an evolution of technology compared with their other plants as it houses the fastest wine filler in New Zealand, which at full speed can bottle enough wine to fill two 20 foot export containers every hour. "We have the latest technology in bottling and in satellite racking storage. As a group we handle over 120 million bottles every year and our warehouses hold more than 60 million bottles of wine at any given time. Our bottling equipment caters for both large runs and also those wineries wanting to bottle smaller parcels of wine." Over the decades WineWorks has grown with their customers, says Tim. "They have got bigger, and so, therefore have we. It’s a true partnership, where we work very closely together on multiple touch points. Our relationships are based on faith and trust. One of our company values is that we must consider the customer in every decision we make." WineWorks is recognised internationally for its processes, and its filling lines have been confirmed by independent audit as being in the top three of all bottling lines sampled throughout Australasia. These lines achieve very low levels of dissolved oxygen pickup, a key criteria for winemakers to judge bottling quality. In addition, WineWorks currently carries 14 international certifications, the result of quality work recognised through an arduous annual audit programme that secures global relationships with the likes of BRC, Tesco and Walmart to name a few. It was a somewhat different scenario 21 years ago, when Tim Nowell-Usticke first decided to develop a ‘behind-the-scenes back shed’ to support the wine producers of Hawke’s Bay. A qualified engineer by trade and from a farming background in Central Hawke’s Bay, Tim returned to his hometown of Hastings after intrepid journeys ultimately led to him to working in food packaging facilities in Australia. He returned home in 1995 to raise a family and was also driven by a desire to establish a regional food-processing plant. "I wanted to take a primary product and by processing it, add value to that product. I wanted that increased value to be captured by the region, to enhance regional prosperity. WineWorks was a way to help keep vitality, jobs and wealth in the region where it was produced." Twenty one years ago Tim discovered a young and vibrant grape growing industry, and he knew that by providing the mechanical process of bottling, wine warehousing and distribution along with other complementary services, WineWorks would enable wineries to focus on their core business. "Today we provide the infrastructure to support a thriving wine industry. We add industrial expertise, allowing wineries to focus on what they are good at, and what makes them prosper - growing, making and marketing great New Zealand wine to the world." In addition to the services it initially offered, WineWorks services now include wine transportation, laboratory checks and worldwide distribution. The company also supports elements of the winemaking process particularly for sparkling wine and makes and bottles other beverages like cider and soft drinks at its Hawke’s Bay facility. "We offer industrial expertise, commitment, and targeted investment typically unavailable to individual wineries. We work in partnership with them to minimise the investment, effort and worry they need to expend on that part of their supply chain." Now the twenty-first milestone has been celebrated, and with the new plant open, what lies ahead for WineWorks? For Tim and his team, further expansion is not a current consideration. Instead, he says, it’s time to consolidate. "We have been through 21 years of growth and change, and with the Auckland plant now operational it’s time to concentrate on continuing to provide the levels of service our customers have come to expect over those years. The New Zealand wine industry is going from strength to strength. We have a unique product to sell to the world, and WineWorks will continue to support the industry over the next 21 years and beyond."

Is Losing to the Competition Where P&G falls short against its consumer goods rivals right now. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Oct 2, 2016 at 3:15PM Image source: Procter & Gamble. Procter & Gamble's (NYSE:PG) latest business trends haven't given investors much to cheer about. Organic sales growth slowed for the second straight year in fiscal year 2016, and the consumer goods giant lost market share in four of its five main product categories while holding steady in just one -- its fabric care and home care division. Part of P&G's poor growth can be blamed on a weak selling environment and economic struggles in some of its geographies. Yet the company is also trailing competitors in a head-to-head match up in these important ways. Volume gains The biggest standout when comparing P&G to rivals is its volume figures. Consumer giants typically aim for organic growth that's led by volume gains, or at least includes a healthy mix of volume and pricing upticks that together produce higher sales. Unilever (NYSE:UL) is a great example as it has managed 2.2% improved volume over the past six months that powered organic growth of nearly 5%. In contrast, P&G's volume shrunk by 1% in the 12 months ended this past June, and so the company had to rely exclusively on higher prices to deliver its modest 1% overall organic growth uptick. The good news for shareholders is that a rebound could be in the cards. Volume figures rose last quarter across all of P&G's product divisions, at an average of 2%. That result was still well below Kimberly-Clark's (NYSE:KMB) 4% volume jump, but it does close the gap somewhat. Innovation Innovation is critical to P&G's business since it needs to constantly update existing brands (new and improved) while launching the occasional game-changing product (e.g., Febreze, Swiffer) to stay ahead of rivals. "Winning with consumers around the world and against our best competitors requires innovation," executives explain in the 10-K. "Innovation has always been, and continues to be, P&G's lifeblood." The company has struggled in this area recently. Sure, products like Pampers Swaddlers diapers, Gillette Fusion razors, and Tide Pods detergent are doing well. But P&G hasn't introduced a new hit brand worth over $1 billion in annual sales in more than a decade. Image source: P&G. By contrast, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is on an innovative roll lately. The healthcare titan got one-quarter of its sales last year from products that it introduced in just the past five years, which is a testament to an innovation strategy that's backed by $9 billion of annual spending on research and development -- up 10% since 2013. Compare that to Procter & Gamble's R&D commitment that has held steady at $2 billion in each of the last three years. Value focus By its own admission, P&G hasn't done an especially good job at catering to the value niche of many of its competitive markets. In razors, for example, the company is enjoying strong growth with premium Gillette Fusion products, but at the same time has lost share from price-based competitors like Unilever's Dollar Shave Club. "We need to do more work on the lower end of the portfolio," Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller told investors in a conference call. That weakness has also left P&G vulnerable to store brands that are offered directly from retailers. Wal-Mart recently credited its private label products for helping produce strong growth in its laundry and home care aisles. The same negative dynamic could quickly shift online, where e-commerce giant Amazon.com is eyeing a few of P&G's strongest categories, diapers, and laundry detergent, with its own private label brands. P&G's brand shedding initiative should boost sales growth and profitability. BT: Before Tax. Image source: P&G. P&G executives are taking steps to close the gap against competitors on all these metrics. The company's portfolio reboot initiative, for one, is likely to boost overall volume growth. And major cost cuts should help it compete better on pricing. In fact, progress on these goals recently gave management the confidence to project the first annual uptick in organic sales growth in years. Yet the 2% gain it is forecasting for fiscal year 2017 would still put P&G behind most of its global rivals. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos has no position in any stocks mentioned.

(Photo: JASON MINTO/THE NEWS JOURNAL)Buy Photo 139 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Before Xboxes and iPads, children played traditional board games such as Monopoly, Chutes & Ladders and Candyland. As time passed, however, kids began to gravitate toward the fast-paced excitement and realistic graphics of video games. Some gaming industry leaders declared the tabletop game market dead. But Smyrna resident Daniel Isom, who works for the Delaware Division of Public Health, is betting on a big comeback for tabletop games. In 2013, he formed his own company, Simple Design Publishing, to produce board games. Isom is raising money to publish a new game called Stop the Germs! "We aren't together when we play video games," Isom said. "Stop the Germs! brings everyone back to the table. It's a family-friendly game that brings that social aspect back." STORY: AstraZeneca moving 134 workers to Delaware STORY: Fans scrambling for Wentz jerseys  Stop the Germs! is packaged in a portable prescription pill bottle. It comes with 30 tiles, two reference sheets and instructions. The goal of the two-player game is to have more germ tiles face up than your opponent. Gamers can use three special tiles to stop their rival from growing germs. The pill bottle packaging makes it easy for players to take the game on the road. Buy Photo Stop the Germs! is a fast-paced strategy game for two competitors.  (Photo: JASON MINTO/THE NEWS JOURNAL) A game can be completed within 15 minutes and recommended for ages 8 and older. "It's a really cool game," Isom said. "It's easy to learn, has a lot of tension and can be played quickly. The fact that it comes in a pill bottle just makes it a really cool idea." Jeremy Peet, a Detroit resident, is the one who came up with the idea for Stop the Germs! Peet, a game designer, was inspired to create the game after he tried to find a second use for the pill bottles used to treat his pit bull's urinary tract infection. He met Isom on a board game website. The two have launched a Kickstarter campaign to publish Stop the Germs! As of Sunday evening, they raised about $3,917,more than half of their $6,000 goal. The Kickstarter campaign ends Monday at noon. Isom said he hopes to have the game published and ready to ship before Christmas, but has listed February as the product's release month to give himself a buffer. Isom and Peet will use the funds raised through Kickstarter to publish 500 copies of the game. Peet said he expects to sell Stop the Germs! online and at niche game and hobby stores rather than big-box retailers such as Target or Wal-Mart. "It's not realistic to expect this in Target," Peet said. "This is a little more on the geeky end of things. It's part of the board game niche." Buy Photo The goal of Stop the Germs! is to have the most germ tiles face up.  (Photo: JASON MINTO/THE NEWS JOURNAL) Isom said many board games are being adapted as digital experiences through online apps or as video games. He said Stop the Germs! could be produced as an app without losing what makes the game unique. "There is a lot of crossover between people who play board games and people who play video games," he said. "Both communities are very accepting of each other." Board games are making a comeback. According to the most recent available data from industry trade magazine ICv2, hobby game market sales totaled $880 million in 2014 with board games capturing $125 million of that total. That represents a 20 percent growth rate over 2013's hobby game sales, ICv2 said. Buy Photo Daniel Isom with Simple Design Publishing looks at the game pieces for Stop the Germs!  (Photo: JASON MINTO/THE NEWS JOURNAL) Video games are expected to exceed $20 billion in sales this year. But for Isom and Peet, the growth of hobby games is an excellent sign for the future. "The industry is changing and growing so much," Peet said. "It is becoming more mainstream and popular, and the internet has made it more accessible." Contact Jeff Mordock at (302) 324-2786, on Twitter @JeffMordockTNJ orjmordock@delawareonline.com.

People hate what they fear. Progressive voters could be forgiven for feeling a little taken aback when hearing the vitriol Hillary Clinton spewed about them to her wealthy donors at a fundraiser as revealed in an audio file that was leaked last week. After all, this is the woman who billed herself as the champion of the progressive agenda, who just last July said, “I take a back-seat to no one when you look at my record on standing up and fighting for progressive values,” suddenly describing herself as politically “center left to center right,” and dismissing the Democrats calling for tuition-free college and universal healthcare as petulant children who “live in their parents’ basement.” It’s always emotionally abrasive to overhear someone saying nasty things about you behind your back, especially when they’ve been going out of their way to cozy up with you to your face. The Clinton campaign has been going out of its way to ingratiate itself to Sanders supporters, going on and on and on about party unity and “stronger together” and doing everything they can to try and minimize the vast chasm of distance between Hillary and Bernie’s political history and ideology, and now we hear her openly spitting on them for a few bucks of campaign funding from rich Democrats. And when they’re making fun of you for being impoverished, when it’s her family’s neoliberal policies that helped create your situation in the first place? Ouch. RT HalleyBorderCol: REMINDER: Being insulted by Crooked Hillary is a badge of honor.#BasementDwellers pic.twitter.com/THRVqlRWjz — ????Bring Back Bernie (@HillaryLostMe) October 2, 2016 It makes perfect sense if you’ve been paying attention, though. The reigning elites of the Democratic party (read: the Clintons and their lackeys) are terrified of the great progressive awakening that Bernie started. And to quote a certain wise old muppet, “Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.” And suffering they are. It’s surely a psychologically uncomfortable experience to always be frantically scrambling to hide the truth while trying to win over a demographic you despise. Why are they fearful, though? They’re fearful because progressives have the ability to take away every single thing they’ve spent their entire political careers working toward. The spread of corporate dominance reinforced by political and military might and the globalization of the Wal-Mart economy are agendas that the Clintons have been inextricably involved in for decades, and many a cushy power position has been awarded to people within the Democratic establishment who’ve helped to facilitate those agendas. And all that goes out the window if the progressives refuse to fall in line with those neoliberal agendas. That’s why they’ve been working so hard to try and lull the progressive awakening back to sleep, assuring us that nothing’s wrong, that the rigged primary is perfectly normal and that Hillary is just Bernie with nicer hair: if progressives start rocking the boat and refusing to elect candidates who won’t tax the rich, care for the poor, avoid war, oppose exploitative trade deals and push hard to eliminate wealth disparity, that whole house of cards comes tumbling down, and all the promises that the Clintons have made to their wealthy financiers will suddenly become a dangerous liability. RT BernCalifornia: Just because we're overlooked, doesn't mean we don't exist.#basementdwellers#BringBackBernie pic.twitter.com/TNKibenlFd — Bring Bernie Back (@FeelTheBern11) October 2, 2016 Progressives are to the Democratic party what Christians are to the Republican party. You know how Donald Trump has to go around pretending that he reads the Bible until November? He does that for the same reason Hillary pretends she cares about poor people. The Democrats need the political left to win elections; if they start courting the conservative vote instead they’ll just replace the crumbling GOP and become the new conservative party, leaving a gaping political hole on the left to be filled by the Greens or a new progressive party. But the major difference between progressives and Christian conservatives is that if Trump ever drops the ball and says maybe women should be allowed to do what they want with their bodies, he’ll immediately lose the support of the Christian right, and he’ll never get reelected. Progressives are far less pushy and entitled, and it’s killing us. It’s time for progressives in America to grow a spine. If we want universal healthcare and tuition-free college, we need to refuse to elect a nominee who hates those things and insist on candidates who support them. If we want an end to corporatist war and predatory trade agreements, we need to refuse to elect a candidate who has loved them throughout her entire career and push for candidates who oppose them. If we want a candidate who supports us and everything we stand for, we need to refuse to vote for a candidate who hates us and everything we stand for. We need to stop falling in line with people who hate us and push hard for what we want because they’re sure not going to hand it to us. They’ve got far too much invested in holding us down.

John Kasich talks about the presidential campaign, the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and other topics during the daily news briefing at the White House in Washington, Sept. 16, following a meeting with the president in the Oval Office. (Carolyn Kaster, Associated Press) Print Email Thomas Suddes, cleveland.com By Thomas Suddes, cleveland.com The Plain Dealer Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 02, 2016 at 5:04 AM, updated October 02, 2016 at 7:01 PM comments And Clinton fans wonder why Hillary and Bill Clinton's slicing and dicing of the English language ticks people off. John Kasich won't be on next month's ballot, but might want to be on 2020's. So, arguably, Ohio's Republican governor is continuing to run for president. August: John Kasich is getting the band back together in New Hampshire, perhaps with an eye on 2020 Kasich, whose term as governor will end in January 2019, is positioning himself as the adult in the room. Nationally, he's been making all the right moves as to Republican movers and shakers: big manufacturers and U.S.-based traders. Oh, and on Sept. 16 Kasich told NBC's Chuck Todd, "It's very, very likely I will not" vote for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. "The chances are minuscule," Kasich said. In mid-September, Kasich went to the White House (as a visitor) to join Democratic President Barack Obama in asking Congress to approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The partnership is a huge trade deal among the United States and 11 other nations (not including China). Kasich wants to help Obama pass Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal And on Sept. 15, The Wall Street Journal published a Kasich op-ed, "A vote against trade is a vote against growth." In contrast, Trump opposes the TPP. So does Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. One of her campaign's websites proclaims, "Hillary Clinton opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, period." But the word "now" seems to be missing from the Clinton campaign's statement: For, as Trump charged during Monday's debate, Clinton did say in 2012 — albeit, before the TPP had been finalized — that the TPP "sets the gold standard in trade agreements." (And Clinton fans wonder why Hillary and Bill Clinton's slicing and dicing of the English language ticks people off.) Also last week, Kasich joined former Defense Secretary Robert Gates (who served in Obama's Cabinet as well as George W. Bush's) in a Columbus foreign policy forum presented by an outfit called the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition. Among the coalition's chairman's caucus members ("most dedicated supporters") are Cincinnati's Procter & Gamble (one of Ohio's Fortune 500 companies), the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, Coca-Cola, Google, Microsoft and Walmart. John Kasich, Robert Gates pick at presidential candidates' foreign policy stances The coalition said that in 2015, "Ohio exported $50.7 billion in goods and services overseas, and trade supported more than one in five local jobs." The coalition, in case you're wondering, supports "strategic investments to elevate development and diplomacy and defense" — that is, trade.  On energy policy, Kasich has demonstrated Statehouse responsibility. For example, he said he would veto any bill that kills the benchmarks for solar and wind power that Ohio electricity producers must meet. The benchmarks are now frozen, but the freeze expires Dec. 31.  State Sen. William Seitz, a suburban Cincinnati Republican, is expected to massage a pending bill so it would replace the existing law's energy mandates and standards, which would otherwise kick in again Jan. 1. The General Assembly first approved the standards in 2008, virtually unanimously. For now, it's unclear whether there's enough support in the Ohio Senate and House for weakening the energy standards. But the Senate, controlled by Republicans continuously since January 1985, isn't exactly considered forward-thinking. On energy standards, Kasich is forward-thinking, as he was in expanding Medicaid, despite grandstanding yelps from the usual Capitol Square mossbacks.  In January 2021, on Inauguration Day for whoever's elected president in 2020, Kasich will be 68; Clinton 73; Trump 74. So there's nothing fantastical about what Kasich's doing.  RNC Chairman Reince Priebus says GOP could bar John Kasich from another presidential run Whether Clinton wins next month (at this writing, she's leading Trump in the RealClear Politics poll average), or Trump wins, voters will likely be in the market for change in 2020. That's why Kasich will keep on keeping on, making sure the GOP's power brokers see his resume, know his face — and remember his name.

Close 'Engineering Explained' is already fixing its Honda S2000 Jeff Glucker Oct 1, 2016 Follow Jeff Add to circle Remember that 2002 Honda S2000 that Jason from Engineering Explained recently acquired? Well, he's already set to wrenching on it because, well, that's what he does. In this video, Jason is installing a fresh timing chain tensioner, as it seems this is a potential failure area for the Honda S2000. The engine in the S2000 makes use of a Borg Warner-sourced timing chain. It's an incredibly durable bit of engine kit that lasts as long as the car will. It should never break. It will, however, stretch over time and this can lead to issues.  When the timing chain stretches, this messes up the timing of the camshaft and crankshaft synchronization. This will also lead to that timing chain tensioner failure. Thankfully, this is a Honda we're talking about here, so the parts to address this issue are available in pretty much any store that sells anything. They probably stock them at Walmart. Jason is going with an aftermarket unit produced by a company called Ballade Sport. It's a billet aluminum piece that fixes the issue mentioned above while also managing to raise oil pressure. This is done by design on the Ballade end, as the piece also increases the internal spring rate of the piston so that it compensates for a stretched timing chain. If you want to learn all about this, you've got 12 minutes of Sunday morning viewing ahead of you. If you just want to watch the repair, then jump to the 6:17 mark.

Restaurants Real Estate Home Business Ace Hardware all in on suburban stores print Share | e-mail Facebook Tweet StumbleUpon Google 2810137 false Mike Mantucca / Chicago Tribune Ace Hardware CEO John Venhuizen believes that the underdog mentality of the company has been a key factor in its success. Click here to enlarge image Ace Hardware all in on suburban stores By Lauren Zumbach / Chicago Tribune Published Oct 2, 2016 at 12:02AM CHICAGO — A boom in home remodeling has put the spotlight on strong sales at home improvement chains like Home Depot and Lowe’s, but Ace Hardware Corp., headquartered in suburban Chicago, also is seeing rising sales and revenues at its retailer-owned stores. President and CEO John Venhuizen, 46, joined the company’s marketing department in 1992. What’s kept him at “The Helpful Place”? Venhuizen said he likes that Ace — despite its claim to be the world’s largest hardware cooperative — still has an underdog mindset. “We duke it out with some of the world’s best retailers, mostly with small family businesses,” he said. In a recent interview with the Chicago Tribune, Venhuizen talked about why he thinks there’s still room for local, neighborhood stores. Q: When you became president of Ace in 2012, how were things going? A: There was no turnaround situation. We called it continuity and momentum. We launched a strategy called 2020 Vision with a stated objective to address challenges and leverage our strengths. We said there were four imperatives, four levees, that we think … will help us withstand any competitive onslaught. The first is invest in the brand. We believe this notion of globally trusted, but locally embraced. The second is fulfill the promise, which is all about our irrational pursuit of amazing customer service. We’ve won 10 J.D. Power awards in a row, and we like to pretend we’ve never seen one. Three, I call enriching the assortment — a maniacal commitment to high quality, differentiated and locally relevant product. Four is a business-to-business initiative we call “be the supply place.” Local businesses are our neighbors too. Q: How big is the business-to-business side now? A: It varies wildly but on average, our stores will see somewhere between 15-20 percent of their business from small businesses. The enemy here isn’t Grainger or Fastenal, the enemy really is Costco and Sam’s Club, where a lot of small businesses are trekking to warehouse clubs to buy the stuff to maintain their businesses. And so we think we have a better proposition that’s right next to you, that’s loyal, with a person behind it to offer their services. Q: It sounds like it’s a similar pitch to businesses and consumers. A: It is, and shame on us for not pounding that a little further a little faster, but it has gained significant momentum for us. Because it resonates when a local business owner can get support and understanding from another business owner. Q: So you think there’s still room for that neighborhood feel? A: We talk to our stores about owning the last mile. Our stores are in neighborhoods. This isn’t a corporate operation. We have 4,931 stores, and we own 92 of them. Every single other store is locally owned and operated, and they serve their neighbors with that irrational level of pursuit. Q: You’ve said that when 2020 Vision started, Ace was losing stores. Why? A: We had eight out of 11 years in a row where we had less U.S. stores at the end of the year than when we started. Our new store efforts have been good. The real problem was just general business atrophy from owners who had no succession plan or exit strategy and over time started removing themselves from the business. So with the support of the board we put a lot of tools and education around that, with this message that running a retail store is not easy, and there is a better way to monetize your life’s work than to liquidate at 30-40 cents on the dollar. This will be the fifth year in a row where we have had increased store count in the U.S. every single year. We haven’t solved that problem entirely, but we’ll open 150-160 this year, and we’ll lose probably less than 90. Q: There’s been a lot of talk of hardware stores benefiting from a strong home renovation market. Does Ace also see that? A: A rising tide lifts all boats so it doesn’t hurt, but we don’t stand to benefit as much because of the renovation nature of it. We get less upside since most of our stores do not have the kind of products you could build a home from scratch with. Generally speaking we’re much more that convenience-oriented, home preservation place. Q: Is that something that’s shifted or has Ace always had that different focus? A: If you go back 30 years, pre the onslaught of the big box, it was probably more in our wheelhouse and the truth is the big boxes, particularly Depot and Lowe’s, have changed the game with these massive stores. For the last decade, we are to Home Depot and Lowe’s what Trader Joe’s is to Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart clearly has the market share, Depot clearly has the market share, but if you want a convenient location, you want a lot better service and a little higher quality of goods, that’s who we want to be. The chocolate-covered pretzels are just better at Trader Joe’s. We’re not trying to be a lesser them, we want to be a better us. Q: How does being a co-op of independent stores help you, and how does it make it tougher? A: We have the skill of the locally embraced and highly empowered entrepreneur who will know their community better than anyone in this building ever will, coupled with the scale of a globally trusted brand. To us it’s the best of both worlds. We have a large department that sources and procures product in massive quantities to try to bring locally relevant stuff to the local stores and empowers them to locally curate anything else they think will work in their market. Can it be challenging? Yes. When you have owners who are your customer, do they have opinions that we hear regularly? Yes. But we can cry and complain about that like we’re smarty pants know-it-alls, or we can say they’re living it on the front lines. I would tell you with no false humility that most of our best ideas started in the stores who tried it on their own. Q: Can you give me an example? A: Yeti (a brand of high-end coolers that became a hot seller). We didn’t come up with that. That was not in our strategic plan two years ago. But we saw volume in a thing we didn’t know a lot about and we started to research it and now, using the local skill, the local risk-taking, it’s stocked in our distribution system so we can get it to them in a much more efficient way. Q: When you do find a great idea, how long does it take to recognize it and roll it out? A: Always longer than I’d like. There’s some needed bureaucracy to make sure we are mitigating risk. Particularly if it’s a small or local vendor it can take a sizable amount of time for them to ramp up. I wouldn’t argue we lead the world in speed once we see a good idea, but we do want to lead the world in identifying those and being the most bottom-up place you’ve ever been to. 15204874 View next article in Business     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

Weiss Lake has just completed an extensive reef-building program.Corps of Engineers  The Weiss Lake Fish Habitat Enhancement program was completed Sept. 14 at Weiss Lake according to guide Mark Collins, one of the organizers. Sponsored by Alabama Power and The Weiss Lake Improvement Association, the project drew a number of local volunteers and their boats to assist in this program. Collins said 145 new Fish Attracting Devices (FADs) were placed in Yellow Creek this month. He said 134 FAD's were placed in the Little River and Chattooga River arms of the lake in July of 2015, and 171 FAD's were placed in Cowan Creek and Big Spring Creek in December of 2015. Most of the FADs are brush, but some are plastic structures from Berkley, which also supports the program. The idea is to provide spawning habitat for crappies as well as feeding areas for largemouth bass. The structures attract baitfish, and so are good fishing spots much of the year. The GPS coordinates for these reefs are available to the public, free, on Collins' website www.markcollinsguideservice.com and at https://apcshorelines.com/our-lakes/weiss/ ,or contact WLIA at http://weisslakeimprovementassociation.org/ Collins encourages area anglers to join the Weiss Lake Improvement Association, for a $10 donation, to help support the fish attractor program, and notes the donation also earns a badge to participate in the spring Crappie Rodeo, which will award up to $100,000 in prizes in 2017. The event tags dozens of crappie and releases them back into the lake, and anglers catching one of the tagged fish can earn from $50 up to $1,000 for the catch -- but only if they're in possession of a Crappie Rodeo entry badge. The rodeo runs from Feb. 15 to April 30, 2017. Entry is available at many lakeside businesses around Centre, Cedar Bluff and Leesburg as well as at the area Walmart. Visit www.weisslakecrappierodeo.com for details. (When I checked this Thursday, it still had the info for the 2016 event which is now over, but hopefully it will be updated directly.) ***** The Morgan County Chapter of the Alabama Wildlife Federation will hosts its annual Wild Game Cook-off Tuesday, October 4, at Ingalls Harbor in Decatur. The cook-off gives backyard chefs and sportsmen an opportunity to show off their wild game cooking skills as festival-goers enjoy an evening of friendly competition, music, prizes and samples of some of the best wild game in Alabama. The event, now in its 22nd year, typically attracts over 40 teams who prepare unique culinary dishes using turkey, quail, wild pig, venison, duck, and fish. For those interested in what Alabama wild game tastes like, competing teams will provide free samples. The competition contains three divisions – Fish, Fowl, and Game. First, second, and third place awards will be given to the teams with the tastiest dish in each division. Additional awards go to Best Overall Winner, Best Presentation, and People's Choice. There is no entry fee to compete. Along with the cook-off and samplings, the event also offers music, silent auction, raffle prizes, and door prizes for children and adults. Doors open at 5:30 p.m. and all activities take place at Ingalls Harbor located at 802 Wilson Street NW in Decatur. Tickets are $35 per couple/person and children under 15 years old are admitted free. The ticket price includes a one-year membership in the Alabama Wildlife Federation, a subscription to the Alabama Wildlife magazine, and free samples from those competing at the cook-off. All proceeds from the event benefit AWF, the oldest and largest non-profit conservation organization in Alabama. For more information or to register a team, call David Thomas at 256.606.4161, Jill Stone at 256.318.4422, or Sam Glover at 256.318.0157.

(Bethany Freudenthal Photo) Roswell Mayor Dennis Kintigh met Wednesday with Daily Record editorial staff for the mayor’s monthly forum with the newspaper. The following are the staff’s questions and the mayor’s responses. Let’s start with the Parks and Recs Commission. What’s your reaction to the criticism they laid out in their recent meeting about being excluded from the process of all these parks and recreation issues? “There was a failure to communicate. [auth] I’ve discussed this with the city manager. That needs to be corrected. They need to be informed.” How did that happen? You would think that would be an automatic part of the process. “I would think so, too. I don’t know what happened. Do we go back and ask who failed to do what, or do we say, ‘Hey, let’s get this fixed.’ My understanding is at the next Parks and Recreation Commission meeting, senior staff will be present. I don’t know if that means the city manager, I think it does, but it depends on his schedule. “But the idea is that yeah, they need to be informed of major activities that are going on. Because they’re advisers, to advise us on programming and other things. The City Council, the elected governing body, is responsible for things like allocation of resources, budgeting, all of those things, making the final decisions. The council is the one chosen by the voters, and the ones who are accountable. So they are the ones that have the authority and responsibility for making these final decisions. But that means the commission should be cut in.” Do you feel like it is worthy of an apology to the parks and recreation commissioners? “I’m sorry this didn’t happen.” Do you have any reaction to the fact that the Leadership Roswell Alumni Association candidate forum has been cancelled, largely due to what I would have to say is the obstinance of the Republican Party candidates? “A couple of them. I go back a long ways with Leadership Roswell. I was actually in the class that graduated in 2001. I was part of the alumni association for many years, and participated in these forums. I’m a huge advocate of these forums. I know some don’t like the format and I’ve heard that criticism for many years from certain individuals, some of whom now are candidates that are up. So their criticisms are not new. They don’t like the canned questions, they want it more freewheeling. One of the questions is generally more philosophical in nature. I don’t think those are bad things, but there are those who just don’t like it. Nothing I’ve been able to say to them over the years has convinced them otherwise. “I am hopeful that they will do the school board elections coming up in February. I’m hopeful when the municipal elections come up in March 2018, they’re up for that. To me, the Leadership Roswell candidate forums were really geared, in many ways, for entry-level candidates, in other words those who have not run for office much. If you’ve been in politics for a while, you kind of get a little toughness about you. Some people are almost scared to death to speak to a crowd. And it’s sad, because it doesn’t make them bad people or bad decision-makers. I like the format, so I’m sorry it happened. I’m not surprised because I’ve heard these criticisms for years.” Let me follow up on that again, so you have participated in the forums before? “Yes. Before I actually ran for office I was part of the community that came up with questions, and back in the day, I was the timekeeper.” Can you say at this point if you’ll run for re-election in March 2018? “I’d say it’s too early to make that final decision because we’re talking 17 months out, and a lot can happen.” What are you thinking at this point, do you intend to run? “I am inclined to do that, but I’m not making a commitment. I’m not making an announcement. And the reason why I say that is my health, my wife’s health, we have adult children, you have to remember all those other things are much more important. So let’s hold that one for a few months, OK? I’ve done absolutely nothing to initiate any kind of re-election effort. Nothing like that has even begun, so, we’re a ways off.” What’s your reaction to the public input that we’ve received so far on the aquatic center meetings? We’ve had four public hearings in the last couple of weeks. “I didn’t make the last three, I had conflicts, but the first one we had like 29, I think it was, not-elected officials, non-staff, and that was my count. And then I guess Monday night there was like five. I don’t know how many on Tuesday afternoon and Tuesday night, but it doesn’t sound like much more than four or five. That disappoints me. I mean, you guys have talked about the pool a lot. I don’t think we’ve tried to avoid talking about it, I’ve never avoided your questions, so I am a little disappointed we don’t have more input. I’m not sure how we overcome that. I’m not really sure what the problem is. Because we tried during the day, evenings, I mean I don’t know. I would have liked to have had more input. Maybe we need to solicit it online, Facebook. I think we actually do that now. I wish we had more.” Once we get to the point where we have a very specific proposal, are you going to hold more public meetings regarding that, or are you just going to present it to the council? “I think what we do is we use the committee process to iron that out and then we get it to the whole council. And what I will encourage, and I’ve had this discussion with Councilor Best and Councilor Denny — Denny’s got General Services, Best’s got Infrastructure — that they have combined meetings to discuss the concept and that those committees come up with a concept. Now, maybe we do have a workshop or we chew on it for a little bit, but I want the committees to bring to the whole governing body a draft design. And then the council, then we have to make some hard decisions. I don’t want the council to get into saying, ‘Well, this room should be 10 feet rather than 12 feet.’ No, no, no, no. We need to be more global.” How long would you estimate before it gets to the council? Are we talking six months? “Oh, good heavens, no. I don’t think we could make November. I think we’ll have to do December. Here’s the thing, if we go to the voters for the general obligation bond, they need to know what we’re talking about.” When’s the earliest the bond election could be held? “We’re now talking no earlier than June 6th. The city clerk and I and some other folks talked a little bit, she was very concerned. Here’s what we got, we’ve got a school board election in February and you can’t put it on that, which it’s frustrating. But on the other hand, I’m not sure we want to muddy the waters. The people who do the voting, those are the same folks, they’re going to be busy with the counts afterwards, canvassing. Then, we’re going to start another campaign the day after? No, I think everybody needs a break. May, there are a lot of graduations and stuff like that. June is a historical primary month for New Mexico. I’m thinking June 6th. That’s the first Tuesday in June. We’ll see. It’s still subject to change.” At this point are you looking at two combined bonds? “Yeah, I’m looking for one question. Do we build this complex, the aquatic facility and rec center, combined?” At a cost of roughly $16 million? “That’s a rough number. We haven’t gotten any quotes from the consultants yet. But everybody seems to think that’s a good rule of thumb.” Can you talk about Elaine Mayfield and her retirement. She was suspended, and now she has announced her retirement? Am I correct about that? “Yes.” I know it’s a personnel matter, but there are some zoo improvements that are going on. Is there any connection here to the improvements going on? “No, not from my understanding. And by ordinance, the governing body, myself and the councilors, are prohibited from being involved in personnel matters, which is what you want. So we don’t get involved. That’s all done by the city manager, who, I would argue, is about as independent as you are going to find.” There are a lot of questions that are circulating about Elaine. She’s so well-known, so highly respected, and it was kind of a bumpy ride to her retirement. There are a lot of questions. “That I am not in a position to answer because what limited information I have, I’m not convinced is completely accurate. I think what we will probably do is have a briefing of the council by Mr. Hogan in closed session, because it’s a personnel matter. And then an appropriate statement to the media. I recognize exactly the question and it’s valid.” Is Mr. Hogan getting acclimated as interim city manager? How is the city manager hiring process going? “Mr. Hogan has hit the ground running and it’s kind of interesting and fun to watch because he’s done these interim (jobs) before, he knows his stuff. What we are doing is we are having four candidates come to Roswell, the four finalists from the whole process. They will be arriving for a two-day visit. Candidate No. 1 arrives Monday evening, starts Tuesday morning with a meeting with me, he meets with staff. And then Tuesday afternoon there will be a workshop with city councilors. “We will go around in circles, kind of like here, until the councilors are done.” Is candidate No. 1 or any of the other candidates from Keller, Texas? “None of them are from Texas at all. “I’m going to ask for input because these candidates are going to visit with staff, community leaders there’s all kind of people. “I will ask the councilors how do you rank them, individually. I’m going to ask them, who’s No. 1, 2, 3, and 4. Yes, I am responsible for making the nomination. It does me no good to nominate someone that an overwhelming majority of the council or significant majority are just dead-set against.” If they reject your nomination, do you have to come back with another nomination or can a motion at the council meeting come up for any of the other three? Does the nomination have to come through you? “Yes, that’s one of the few things that I have authority over, is to make the nomination.” Are any of the candidates female? “No, they’re all white males.” Really? “That’s who the final four ended up being.” Can you tell us more about your efforts to have E-Commerce taxed in a way that increases the GRT? “E-Commerce is already eligible for taxing. It should be collected. We’re just not collecting it. “If you sell something through Etsy to a person in Keller, Texas, you don’t collect gross receipts tax. But if you sell it to a person in Aztec, guess what? You do. Well, what the heck is that? Twenty eight states collect sales tax, they call it, on Amazon sales, if you will. This is not a radical position. At the ACI meeting, it was pointed out this is one of those few issues on which ma and pa retail and Wal-Mart are in agreement. There are some good hardcore Republicans, like myself, who believe this is not a new tax. This is simply a tax that has been on the books and we have not collected. And now we need to set up a mechanism to collect it. “One of the challenges is what rate do you charge, and where does the tax go? In other words, where the seller is located, where the buyer is located, where the transaction occurred? And my position is it should go to a city corresponding to the ZIP code on the credit card of the purchaser. So say I’m in Chicago, I get online while I’m waiting on my flight and I order something from a company in Florida to be delivered to my daughter in Round Rock. The tax proceeds should come to Roswell. That’s where my billing address is. That’s my take on it.” So how much of this is under the authority of the city and how much of it is under the authority of the state Legislature? “None of this is under the city. This is all state Legislature. The folks up there in Santa Fe need to earn their pay.” You said publicly that some businesses and individuals choose not to relocate to Roswell because of crime. Do you think the problem is as bad as the perception or is the perception the problem? “No, I think we have a serious crime problem, especially in the state of New Mexico. I think we have a crime problem.” Comparatively, how do we rank? “Violent crime-wise, the state of New Mexico is one of the worst in the nation.” I’m thinking about Roswell, compared to the rest of this state. “City-wise, it’s a serious problem and one of the topics we can talk about is domestic violence. We need to have some serious dialogue about that and we’ve got to change people’s perception on what’s acceptable behavior and what’s not. You don’t hit people because you’re upset with him. “We’re getting into an area here where I think we fail to treat seriously those who have demonstrated an unwillingness to comply with the standards of society. I will give you a brief example. Those individuals who are facing charges and are out on conditions of release, bond, or individuals who have been convicted but are on probation, basically given another chance, if they commit serious offenses, there is no enhancement. They can have their bond or their probation revoked, but there’s no serious consequences. When you go out on those things, the judge says to you … you cannot do X,Y, Z, one, two, three, tells it to your face. Then you go out and deliberately disobey that and steal or beat up somebody or do something like that, I’m sorry, you’ve had that second chance. You need to get slapped and you need to suffer more severe consequences. “Because there’s two points here. One, they talk about deterrence and I understand the murkiness of the whole issue of deterrence, but there is no question that individuals who are incarcerated are not able to hurt folks out in the public. They might hurt other people in incarceration, but what I’m saying is, at some point you have to recognize you’re taking the bad apples off the street and protecting the vulnerable.” How do you feel about city funds going to help provide more and better entertainment in the city? “I’m open to a discussion on that one. I mean, we have lodgers tax funding. The question is how much are we talking about and in what form? I think it would be desirable, I’m not sure it’s entirely appropriate, but I think it would be desirable to be able to encourage local musicians, say, to do music in dining facilities, particularly downtown or in Reischman Park, something like that. But that’s a real murky area.” Are there any future plans to provide a venue for larger performers to come in town? “Engineering is doing some advanced design work on the convention center upgrade. So that will provide a larger venue, how much larger, I can’t tell you, I don’t know. But it will be an improved sound system and a better venue for musical activities and events. How that works out, we’ll see. But yes, the convention center is going to be upgraded. “We’ve got a revenue stream, the so-called bed tax or bed fee, as certain councilors prefer to call it, that produces around $600,000 a year that could service debt for upgrading, and that’s the plan. We have more and more flexible breakout rooms, because the three rooms we have now are brick and mortar. They’re not really flexible. I’m told we will have it done within two years.” What did you think of Parks Commissioner JaneAnn Oldrup’s criticism of your suggestion to host weddings on the 14th hole of the municipal golf course? “I said yeah, you’re right, we should have communicated with you. She will not be bashful about chewing me out, and she’ll do it to my face, too.” What about Mr. Jim Burress idea to install lights on the golf course for a walkway? “I like to explore what we’ve got there as far as the options about walking. You don’t want to put people at risk. Golf balls can hurt people, so you have to be careful about that. So we’ll see where we’re at. If a group does come forward and say it’s interested in taking over the Cahoon Park Pool and re-opening it until a new aquatic facility is built, are you open to a discussion? “Nothing is off the table. The city is focusing on a new facility, but if there is a group that wishes to come forward to try and do this, I would candidly like to see it. Because I feel the criticisms have been unfair. I believe that the city engineering staff, led by Mr. Najar, and the Parks and Rec Department have legitimately evaluated this and said this is not prudent to continue to operate this. “That’s the position we’ve gotten from respectable, I consider very respectable, staff. I mean Mr. Najar is a professional engineer with degrees in civil engineering. That is not trivial. Yet, others have said that this decision was slip-shot or poorly made or whatever. Well OK, what’s your answer? And I mean this seriously. I mean, it’s easy to sit back and throw stones. Come forward and give us a definitive proposal. “If it’s only going to cost $10,000, I’m not committing the city nor can I, but we can have that conversation. But what I’m saying is that’s one thing. But then to turn around and say, ‘Well, it needs a million dollars to keep it going for two years or three years,’ that’s the heart of the frustration that staff and the governing body feels. Yeah, that’s the point we had all along. We’re like ‘no,’ because if a million dollars buys us three years or four years, what happens at the end of that three or four years? Another million or is it now $2 million? And at what point is it we needed to have invested this money in the new facility? “I know that some of these individuals involved in this thing have some serious resources. So let these individuals come forward.” Related Posts About the Author: - RDR Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment. « Alzheimer’s Walk marches on to raise awareness Country music icon Willie Nelson to perform at Lea County Event Center » Business Review E&CS Electric Inc.

Her birthday is Saturday — she’ll be 44 — and she is a breast-cancer survivor. She was diagnosed with the disease in 2008, but she has been walking in the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure in Little Rock since 2002 and plans to participate Oct. 22. Anita Cegers-Coleman of Conway doesn’t like to be in front of people — unless she’s teaching or dancing — but she’s having to get used to it. The 43-year-old Ruth Doyle Middle School keyboarding teacher was thrust into the spotlight as the Conway School District Teacher of the Year and, in late September, was named one of 14 regional finalists for 2017 Arkansas Teacher of the Year. “I really wasn’t expecting to hear anything, and then I got a letter that I was one of the semifinalists, so that was fun,” she said. On Wednesday, she went to the state Capitol to be honored with the other semifinalists. Although she wasn’t one of four semifinalists announced, “I’m absolutely OK with it. The competition was extra stiff this year.” Cegers-Coleman met Gov. Asa Hutchinson and received a certificate, a check and a long-stemmed rose. “He did commend me for starting a coding club,” she said. It’s been an exciting few months since she was named the district’s teacher of the year in May after being picked as Ruth Doyle’s representative. Cegers-Coleman was teaching coding one day in May when she was surprised by her principal, Debi Avra, and Superintendent Greg Murry, who came to her classroom with balloons and cookies — on Pajama Day, of all days. “I had my hair pulled back, no makeup, and I think I was wearing sweatpants,” Cegers-Coleman said, laughing. “I’m standing there bawling. I had it under control, but the tears were flowing.” She called her husband, Bernard, and put her cellphone on speaker so her students could tell him the good news, just as they had done when she was named Ruth Doyle Teacher of the Year. “That was special for them to play a part,” she said. Cegers-Coleman said that when she filled out the lengthy paperwork to submit for the district honor, she had Avra read it first. “Mrs. Avra came to my door. She said, ‘CC — can I be honest?’” Cegers-Coleman said, recalling the sinking feeling she had. “She said, ‘I see all your achievements, … but I don’t see the CC I know.’” Avra said after Cegers-Coleman was named to the district honor that “whether it’s working with students at lunchtime to catch them up in keyboarding or cheering them on from the sidelines at games, her presence and extra efforts are noted. She is not afraid to accept challenges and enthusiastically models a we-can-do-it attitude.” So, Cegers-Coleman said she injected more of her personality into the application — “that I have a quiet spirit most of the time, but I smile a lot and try to get along with everybody. Even though kids may think I’m strict, they don’t realize some nights I lose sleep praying about things they are going through.” Children often have problems at home, which distracts them in class, she said. “They deal with a lot more than some adults could handle.” She said teachers heard recently that a truck hit one of the students, but they didn’t know any details. Cegers-Coleman spent a sleepless night and found out the following morning the student was OK. Cegers-Coleman said faith plays a big role in her life, and she relied on it when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008 when she was 36. She had gone to an eight-week boot camp at Conway Regional Health and Fitness Center, and she felt pain in her right breast when she ran. She went to the doctor, “and he was telling me cancer doesn’t hurt, so that shouldn’t be it.” A mammogram led to a biopsy, which revealed breast cancer. “Thankfully, it was Stage 0,” she said. She took 35 rounds of radiation and underwent a lumpectomy. “Because it was such a low stage, I had a positive outlook going through it,” she said. She has participated in the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure in Little Rock since 2002, and she’ll be in the race Oct. 22, too. “I really like October because it’s my birth month and Breast Cancer Awareness [Month],” she said. She will turn 44 on Saturday. A native of Pine Bluff, she is beginning her 22nd year of teaching, a career decision she made early in her life. “I have loved school forever,” she said. “I used to play school with my little brothers, the neighbor kids and my stuffed animals, so it was fun.” Her mother, Linda Cegers of Pine Bluff, teaches third grade in the Dollarway School District and was Cegers-Coleman’s inspiration to go into education. James Cegers, her father, died in 1993. He worked at International Paper in Pine Bluff. Cegers-Coleman said her mother, who was a child when her parents divorced, had a hard time in school for a while. A teacher took a special interest in her mother, and it led her to go into education. One of Cegers-Coleman’s two brothers is a math coach in a school in Pine Bluff, she said. Cegers-Coleman is also good at math, which she describes as “like solving a puzzle.” She majored in math and minored in business education at the University of Central Arkansas in Conway. She also has a master’s degree in business education. She taught math and keyboarding at Conway Junior High School and spent 15 years teaching keyboarding at Bob Courtway Middle School, now Bob and Betty Courtway Middle School. She’s also a nationally board-certified teacher. Her first big teaching honor came in 2004, when she was named Harkrider Walmart Teacher of the Year and received $1,000 — and a blue smock. She kept that smock hanging in her classroom for years, she said. The past three years, she has taught keyboarding to fifth-, sixth- and seventh-graders at Ruth Doyle, although a coding-block class has replaced keyboarding this year for seventh-graders. She started a coding club last year, and this year’s club meets on Fridays and does activities with coding websites and electronic gadgets. Basically, keyboarding is learning to type on a computer keyboard. She laughed as she recalled that some parents “thought it was a musical keyboard,” she said, pretending to play piano, and she had to explain it. In addition, students learn how to type different kinds of documents, learn keyboarding terms, “and we even get into coding,” she said. The difficulty level of the skills increase in each grade level, and Cegers-Coleman pushes students — who call her Mrs. CC — to get faster and better. She comes in before school and is available at lunch and after school to help students who are behind. Not only is she available; she’s been known to track down students to make sure they get their work done. “I can be a taskmaster at times; they come up with excuses,” she said. It’s for their own good, she said, because when they get in eighth grade, they have to be fast on the Chromebooks to keep up with their work. “They’ve been using technology all their lives, so they come to us with all these bad habits,” she said. “What I really enjoy is when former students come up and say, ‘Thank you for pushing us so hard,’” she said. “That makes me feel good; it’s rewarding. I try not to be the mean, old typing teacher,” she said, laughing again. Two students were sitting at a small table outside Cegers-Coleman’s classroom, eating their lunches one day last week. Their enthusiasm for Cegers-Coleman was immediate when asked if they were her students. “Oh, yeah! She’s a great teacher,” said Shamiya Pearson, 12, her eyes widening. “And she’s a very nice teacher. I wish we had one of her at every school.” “She’s amazing,” 11-year-old Gabby Stagner said. “We get to do fun projects. I think she’s very lucky to be teacher of the year.” Cegers-Coleman said she had to speak to the faculty this fall as the district honoree, and she dreaded it all summer. Talking in front a classroom full of students comes naturally, she said, and — something that might surprise people, she said — is that in college, she loved to be “front and center” when she did step shows with her fellow Delta Sigma Theta sorority members. She also has danced with her alumni group during UCA homecoming. Thinking about addressing her fellow teachers made her nervous, though. “Generally speaking, I’m quiet and laid-back,” she said. “That was nerve-wracking — just the anticipation of knowing I had to do that.” She only had to speak for five minutes, and as it turned out, “it wasn’t that bad,” she said. Cegers-Coleman received a $2,000 award as District Teacher of the Year, $500 of which was hers to use for whatever she wanted, and $1,500 for the classroom. She decided to focus on her coding club and has ordered “lots of electronic gadgets for them to explore,” she said. She also received $1,000 as a regional finalist. The Arkansas Teacher of the Year receives an additional $14,000. “I’m not upset; of course, I would have loved to have won the money,” she said. “I’m happy for [the four semifinalists] because they’ve been achieving things on a larger scale. “Seeing the level of competition we had this time, I can definitely get the word out we could do things on a bigger scale; we have the resources. Whoever the new [Ruth Doyle] teacher of the year is, I can help them with District Teacher of the Year,” she said. “I’m still excited; everybody’s been so supportive, and I didn’t expect to achieve what I have. Who knows what the future holds.” Senior writer Tammy Keith can be reached at (501) 327-0370 or tkeith@arkansasonline.com.

Today, their $10 million dollar hair care line, Mixed Chicks, is popular amongst multiracial women with straight to slightly wavy to tightly curled hair all across the country. They will soon be honored at the Action Icon Awards on October 16, 2016 for their hard work. “Mixed Chicks has 25 SKUs in shampoos, conditioners, styling products, cosmetics and accessories,” Levy said. These women did not always know they’d become publicly recognized for developing hair care. The opportunity came by chance a few years ago, when the two discovered they needed an effective curling product for their “combination” hair. “There were no products back then for our blended hair texture because most products were made specifically for ethnicity rather than texture,” Etheredge said. Etheredge felt their leave in conditioner was the most popular item among their customers. With the main ingredient being safflower seed oil, Etheredge and Levy described the texture as lightweight and nonsticky for those who wanted to detangle and moisturize their hair. “People we knew gave us compliments and asked what we do for our curls. We then started handing out samples of the ‘concoction,” Levy said. The combination of natural ingredients used on the twins’ hair earned many compliments from friends and family who requested product samples, said Etheredge. They eventually took their business to the next level. Etheredge recalled that Mixed Chicks was developed in 2003, and by April 2004, products were listed on their website. “One day, Kim and I went to the mall and in every few stores, someone asked us what we used on our curls. We then knew the demand for products that embrace curls was huge,” Levy said. Today, the hair care line is found in stores such as Target, Walmart, Rite Aid, Walgreens, Bed Bath & Beyond, grocery stores, salons as well as beauty supply retailers. Contrary to what some may believe, women aren’t the only ones who can use Mixed Chicks hair products. “Because we’re a multiracial line, a plethora of men, women and children from all ethnicities and walks of life benefit from our products,” said Levy. Most recently, the twins were featured on ABCs “She Talks” program. The Action Icon Award honors their support of Diamond in the Raw Foundation, which benefits female teenage foster children and at-risk youth this Oct. 16.

(Photo: Jessica J. Trevino, Detroit Free Press)Buy Photo For Elanca Heard of Clinton Township, it's a way to help make ends meet for her household of four. For Nadhima Koza — struggling with too many bills, including medical insurance deductibles and co-pays — it puts food on her table of her Macomb Township home. And for Amy LaDuke, it offers free food for her three boys when it’s difficult to get food stamps — or enough of them — and to afford items at the grocery store. “I don’t know what I’m gonna do without this place,” the Shelby Township mother said. “It’s gonna be really sad to see this close.” That’s the sentiment of clients, volunteers and employees at Hope Center Macomb  — Macomb County’s first client-choice food pantry that started in 2010 and is set to close its doors Nov. 1. The last clients will be served their last full shopping carts Oct. 28 at the pantry on Groesbeck in Fraser. The nonprofit’s board of directors announced plans Sept. 19 to shut down the pantry, which Executive Director Steve Gibson said takes care of 25,000 clients with food needs in addition to other services, such as finding employment. “None of us are excited about it. It’s disappointing,” he said. "It's always a constant priority to try to get that funding. It's very competitive out there. ... We still had some great vision for the place. Again, economics are the big issue.” ► From the archive: Hope Center Macomb to farm fish, grow produce indoors Board Member Sue Blanchard, who voted against the closure, said the decision to close  "was a complete shock." She said she received a phone call in the evening about the proposed financial move to close the center and was "dumbfounded." She said she was told she would receive an e-mail  the next day. "This has been very, very hard. I know what a difference we can make in people's lives," she said, adding that she was proud that services were "provided on a shoestring. Now what are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?" She added "now what we're praying for is another Dan Gilbert" to step up and offer support. Mark Boone, executive board director, could not be reached for comment. “So where are we supposed to go now for food?” asked Rachael Dougherty of Sterling Heights, a single mother who was gathering food at the pantry for her children, a 5-year-old and a 15-year-old with Down syndrome. “They gave me a list,” LaDuke said, as she was loading her shopping cart.

Trevino, Detroit Free Press) “They’ve been really great. They really have,” said Dougherty, who has used the pantry for three years, allowing her to save money for bills and clothes for her children. She sipped a coffee, which she received for free at a café set up inside the pantry — a treat she said she hasn’t had in “a long time.” The café and a salon — both run by volunteers and offering free services — were more recent additions to the center, which has always focused on protecting the dignity of the clients it serves. The pantry itself underwent renovations a few years ago, with new displays built by volunteers. It isn’t a traditional food pantry. It was set up so clients — who come by appointment — could shop like they would at a grocery store for food they need, want and can eat. There are breads from local bakeries and other stores, fresh fruit and vegetables, frozen meats and canned items in addition to other necessities, such as infant formula. LaDuke said many stores aren't doubling coupons anymore, which helped her save money to buy soap and other necessities. "Our dollar for a can of corn is no longer is what it used to be," she said. “I’m heartbroken. This can’t be true. This just can’t be true,” said Karla Gardner, who served as Hope Center Macomb’s director of community and donor relations before becoming chief development officer at CARE of Southeastern Michigan last year. ► Related: Thousands of volunteers help others in inaugural Catholic Mercy Day Pantry representatives said the building on Groesbeck that houses the center  is up for sale. The nonprofit, which leases the space, cannot afford to buy the building, Gibson said. Pantry officials were working on moving to a location around 12 Mile and Groesbeck in Roseville, but that required a zoning change, which the group requested. The nonprofit recently received a grant from Walmart to obtain a truck for its operation. Dan Moore, director of volunteers and client services, said funding was getting secured for the possible new location, which hoped to offer more services, including housing assistance, substance-abuse counseling and study centers for children. "Until now, this has been one of the most forward-facing nonprofits I've ever been associated with," said Moore, who added that he has worked 35 years with nonprofits in the area. "Things were coming together. That's why this is heartbreaking," Blanchard said. Gibson said there are more nonprofits vying for the same amount of funding. Also, he said, “priorities shift and change.” He said that in the economic crash years ago, food was the greatest need. Now, he said, the bigger needs are utility bill assistance, transportation and employment.

Trevino, Detroit Free Press) Food pantries remain among the top five requests coming into United Way's 211 help line in the southeast Michigan region, but are behind requests for gas and electric service payment and undesignated temporary financial assistance, according to the second quarter report for this year. They are the third referred service in Macomb County, fourth in Wayne County and sixth in Oakland County, according to that report. According to Feeding America's 2015 annual report, 48 million people — including 15 million children and 5.4 million seniors — struggle with hunger in America. Feeding America's network of food banks helped provide 3.7 billion meals to people in the 2015 fiscal year in the U.S., according to the report. The nation has made progress in reducing food hardships since the height of the recession in 2008 and through 2013, with the rate falling from nearly 19% in 2013 to 16% in 2015, according to the Food Research & Action Center. Detroit-Warren-Dearborn ranked in the top third of 109 metropolitan statistical areas with food hardship from 2014 to 2015, according a June report from the group. Gibson said the group is working to help clients with referrals to other food pantries, many of which are smaller and based out of churches, and to other area services. "We really love and care for our clients. We're saddened by this. This isn't an easy decision," Gibson said. "We are serving clients as best as we can before we shut down. It is a good service for human dignity and humanity. It's not just a box. It's really touching people at the core of who they are." Heard agreed. "It's gonna be a loss to us," she said.

Screenshot/Sky News Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn The coming of the internet, and the global spread of social media, has triggered a period of intensifying cultural chaos. The global consequences are profound. Short term, the digital communications revolution has allowed a cheap con man like Donald Trump to connect directly with hundreds of millions of Americans and take over the once-respectable Republican Party. The power of democracy combined with the digitalisation of political communication has pushed the ideological front line away from the stable centre and towards the rightward fringe – the alt-right, as we are calling it these days, but which Herr Hitler himself would have recognised as an American variant on national socialism – a populist politics founded on hatred of the “Other” (Muslims, a hint of anti-Semitism, a large dollop of anti-Mexican prejudice, a routine contempt for women who challenge him on anything). Philip Roth wrote a novel about the rise of totalitarianism in America, and the entire world is witnessing just that phenomenon coming to grisly fruition. Will he win on November 8? The polls say no, but they are too close for complacency. And even if he loses, there remains a fundamental, era-defining question – how did we get here? How did it come to pass that at least 40% of the American electorate would willingly put someone like Donald Trump in the White House (and similar proportions of the population exist in other countries, let’s be clear – in Australia, nearly 50% of those surveyed in a recent poll supported a ban on Muslim immigration)? Number one in my list of causal factors. In a world where celebrity culture is ubiquitous, and politics is just as much about image as integrity or ability, Trump is a supreme entertainer. He has been on the telly for decades. He has written “how-to-get-rich-quick” books. He is as famous as Johnny Depp and Kim Kardashian. Trump could not have achieved the level of support he now enjoys without the media. Reality TV made him a primetime TV celebrity. Social media allowed him to communicate with and stir up his supporters directly, bypassing traditional media and their gatekeepers. Trump secured intense news coverage, first of his shockingly extreme statements – build a wall to protect America from Mexican rapists, for example – combined with his novelty value as a celebrity capitalist who says “You’re Fired” a lot. For a long time, this coverage did not frame him as a credible candidate, but rather as a novelty outlier. There was always something of the absurd, even amusing, about Trump and his megalomania, and that’s how his campaign was covered at the start. But as his popularity rose, the apparent effectiveness of his pitch became the news story. Then the cycle of provocation, public adulation (by that initially small group who went to his rallies), media coverage and dissemination of those images, more calculated provocation from Trump, and so on in a vicious cycle of intensifying newsworthiness until he had overtaken all other GOP contenders, incompetent and uninspiring as they were. At this point the application of conventional news values made Trump omnipresent. The journalistic principle of objectivity granted him constant visibility and assumed credibility in proportion as he took the primary lead. It is unfair to blame the media entirely for this evolution of the Trump narrative arc, or even for the “false balance” allegedly applied to the story by organisations like the New York Times. If he was the GOP frontrunner, and then the official nominee, under the accepted rules of objectivity in political journalism, how could they not give him his fair share of coverage? How could they reasonably have adopted a bias towards him, if their objective was to inform, objectively, the American people about each candidate and their policies? It’s for the commentariat, and the media of analysis, debate and commentary to engage him if they wish, and many have done so. Others have supported him, or sought to normalise him, such as Sean Hannity and Roger Ailes of Fox News. Greg Sheridan in The Australian declared the first debate “a draw”, with the friendly sounding “everyman” Trump just ahead. On Murdoch’s other key Australian outlet, Sky News, commentators such as Janine Perrett, Andrew Bolt and Ross Cameron have been straining all along to find good things to say about Trump. Liberal Party politician Cory Bernardi on Bolt’s show last week, after acknowledging Trump’s racism and other “minor” flaws, declared that he was still for Trump. But let’s not put all the blame on journalists and let ordinary people off the hook. Trump is a “red in tooth and claw” capitalist of the very worst kind, who used his reality TV performance skills to win the support of those goggleboxed masses who will pay the most for a Trump presidency, should it ever happen. They saw him on The Apprentice, and mistook that for real life. It is their sons and daughters who will die as cannon fodder in the wars Trump will start, or fail to prevent from starting. It is they whose neighbourhoods will be consumed by ethnic and religious sectarian conflict between neighbours, and by electronic surveillance and unconstrained policing. From day one of Trump’s presidency, America will become a free fire zone in which if you are black, or “ethnic”, or Hispanic, or Muslim, you will be fair game for WASPs on the rampage. How do you tell an “illegal migrant” from a migrant? How do you stop a racist shooter from taking the law into his own hands, when Trump advocates that “from day one”, “illegals” will be rounded up and on their way out? It is those Trump-supporting folks without degrees who work in less-regulated, less-secure jobs, who are most vulnerable to sacrifice on the Trumpian altar of profits and wealth for the very rich few. It is they who work at Walmart, or indeed Trump Tower, who will see their welfare state, such as it is, further decline and wither away under the new president’s low-to-no tax regime (zero for Trump, as he proudly conceded in the first debate, because he was “smart”). It is they who will have to hide indoors as riots break out in the streets, and as pogroms of supposed “illegals” sweep up legal citizens of the other, non-white variety. As for the ultimate nightmare of nuclear annihilation, which we thought we had left behind with Ronald Reagan and his Cold War warriors: well, just think of how Trump, as opposed even to the flaky Reagan, would behave in a complex, fast-moving conflict scenario with, say, Russia, China, or North Korea. All of the above, and more, can be regarded as highly likely outcomes of a Trump presidency, given his public statements. The Clinton alternative, if not regarded in many quarters as inspirational, will deliver foreign policy strength with stability built on experience. She declares that she will work to defend and improve public services such as health and welfare. She will continue the great leap forward in the building of America’s ethnic-political culture represented by Obama, the first black POTUS. She will be the first woman president, and for that reason alone historic. Just by being there, she will advance the cause of feminism and women’s rights. Whatever you think of her, it cannot be denied that Hillary has given her life to public service. She bore with huge dignity her husband’s cheating and his emotional betrayals, and enabled his survival as one of America’s most-loved presidents. Trump can threaten her with all kinds of mean, but all she has to do is tell the truth, and then pivot back to his hugely dysfunctional private life. All of this, and also the fact that she is a woman, means that in any rational contest she should be favoured by the majority over any man. She is, as Obama said, the most-qualified person ever to run for POTUS. And yet, to be leading a man like Trump by only 3.1%, by Nate Silver’s count? After all he has said to and about women during this campaign? For there even to be a serious possibility of a Trump victory in November, after all the racism and the woman-hating and the crazy ban on Muslims and the wall and the Putin stuff and the insults to parents of dead war heroes and … after all that, we’re talking about 3.1%? How did we get here, again? Number two of possible causes. Hillary’s unlikeability. Sure, she’s guilty of a bit of this and a bit of that in her long career; of bending some of the rules of her deeply patriarchal political culture. But Trump is an unrepentant, tax-avoiding, racist crook, a con-man and bully, a model of celebrity culture excess. Next to that record, who honestly cares about some missing emails, or a few speeches to Wall Street? No, it’s not hate for Hillary that drives Trump’s working- or even middle-class supporters. They hardly know her. They DO know what Trump represents, but they still want it. Their “country back” – that is: a big, beautiful wall that keeps Mexican rapists out; a purge of suspected Islamists and illegal migrants, no matter that hundreds of thousands of innocent people will be sucked into that particular pogrom. They want government “off their backs”, unaware that if the vote goes their way in November, the liberal, social democratic, slightly dull and perhaps even mediocre managers they have enjoyed for decades will be replaced by the quasi-fascistic jackboot of Trump stomping their Krispy Kreme-smeared faces forever, in true 1984-style. It has been the media which have shifted the boundaries and stretched the fields of discursive and ideological credibility to the point where a figure like Trump can be taken seriously as a major candidate, and there will have to be a reckoning on that after all this is over. But it is an alarmingly large portion of the American people who have made him credible – 13.3 million primary voters, the most ever for a GOP candidate for nomination. And if he becomes POTUS it will be the people who put him there – about 130 million will be needed. Trump might win because these millions are angry about something and have decided to flex their muscles while they still can. When – if – he loses, what will they do next? Win or lose, Donald or Hillary, November 8 is only the end of the beginning. Brian McNair is the author of Communication and Political Crisis (Peter Lang, 2016).

Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 109.95 -0.04 -0.04% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▲ 60.64 +0.99 +1.66% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 756.40 +9.91 +1.33% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 69.19 -2.20 -3.08% 1. Alphabet's 2015 total revenues were $75 billion. Of these, $74.5 billion (99.4 percent of the total) were from Google and the remaining $0.5 billion were non-Google revenues. In terms of profits, non-Google companies had a segment operating loss of -$3.5 billion. 2. If we compare Alphabet to other technology companies in terms of revenues, there are few that are much bigger in size. Apple had $234 billion revenues in FY '15 (fiscal year ending September 2015). Microsoft had $93.5 billion revenues in FY '15 (fiscal year ending June 2015). However, if we look at market valuations, Alphabet is not much far behind Apple and is ahead of Microsoft. So, yes. Alphabet is getting too big in terms of market valuation. Market valuations change every second depending upon the stock price. On Feb. 2, Alphabet market capitalization was more than that of Apple. But, Apple quickly regained the number one spot. On Aug. 1, the top five most valuable companies in the world were technology companies. Alphabet was still holding the second spot. Just under 4 percent of Alphabet revenues in 2015 came from advertising. So, we can say that Google is a technology company that happens to be in the media business, just like Amazon is a technology company that happens to be in the retail business. It makes sense to compare Google with other media companies, just like we would compare Amazon with traditional retail companies such as Walmart.© Pascal Rossignol/Reuters Alphabet shares jumped after reporting strong quarterly earnings, making its combined share classes worth $568 billion, compared with Apple, which had a value of about $535 billion. The top 10 media companies in the U.S. in terms of 2015 revenues are: Comcast Corp., The Walt Disney Co., 21st Century Fox, Time Warner, CBS Corp., Viacom, News Corporation, Discovery Communications, Scripps Networks Interactive and Gannett Co. If we compare Alphabet to other media companies in terms of total revenues, then Alphabet is not only bigger than all of them, but also its revenues are growing much faster than all of them. Most of the media companies generate revenues from several different sources. If we just focus on advertising revenues and compare Alphabet to other media companies in terms of advertising revenues, then Alphabet is "too big". No other company comes closer or has a chance of coming closer. Just see this fact: Google generated $67.3 billion of revenues from advertising in 2015. On the other hand, the combined advertising revenues of U.S. top-10 media companies were $54.7 billion. So, Google generated more advertising revenues in 2015 than the combined advertising revenues of top 10 media companies. and they seem to be growing strong, even at such a large base.

Northridge. CA. Local residents came out to walk at the Lifehouse Church of Northridge, along with others of thousands of faith-based residents from Ventura to San Bernardino counties will march Saturday to raise money to combat poverty. The Walk to Fight Poverty will benefit Lutheran Social Services of Southern California, a 70-year-old social service agency. In the San Fernando Valley, the walkers will gather at Lifehouse Church of Northridge, to raise funds for the agency’s Community Care Center in Canoga Park, which gives away food, clothing and services for the homeless and the poor. Photo by Gene Blevins/LA DailyNews NORTHRIDGE >> It began under a “Walk to Fight Poverty” banner and ended with a message to “Share God’s Love.” Hundreds of faith-based residents from Ventura to San Bernardino marched Saturday for the Lutheran Social Services of Southern California to raise thousands of dollars to help the homeless, hungry and down and out. And as the sun rose above LIFEhouse Church in Northridge, two dozen parishioners circled a church soccer field to support the LSS Community Care Center in Canoga Park. “Our hearts are in helping the local community,” said walker Carissa Lee, 16, of Sherman Oaks, who founded a Students for Families in Need club at Taft High School, “because that’s where we’ll have our biggest impact.” Lutheran Social Services of Southern California has for more than 70 years striven to serve those in need with dignity and respect, according to its Website. The Santa-Ana based nonprofit now helps more than 50,000 residents in 20 locations throughout the region. Its Community Care Center in Canoga Park, which relocated from Van Nuys two years ago after a fire destroyed its outreach center, provides free food, clothes, showers and more to 3,500 homeless and impoverished residents from across the San Fernando Valley. Its food pantry is open four days a week at the center at 21430 Strathern Street in Canoga Park. It also offers urban garden classes, computer training and counseling services. “We are walking as an agency in six counties to fight poverty and raise awareness for the less fortunate in our community,” said Fiona Kilner, area director for the Community Care Center. On Saturday, parishioners from Lutheran and other churches across the Valley converged on the wedge-shaped sanctuary in Northridge, with a modernist tripod topped by a soaring cross. “Lord, you’re always walking ahead of us, and we follow,” its pastor, the Rev. Dana Hansen of LIFEhouse Church, a Lutheran denomination, prayed before the annual walk. Among the walkers were Boy Scouts from Troop 474 of Canoga Park. And Hanns Michael Botz, 64, a retired LAUSD elementary schoolteacher who now teaches at the University of Southern California Graduate School of Education. Botz, a leader at Shepherd of the Valley Lutheran Church, had arrived early to mark the field with blue balloons. Advertisement “The balloons are symbols of the outpouring of love by Lutheran Social Services,” said Botz, who the day before had hauled 1,000 pounds of WalMart produce and goods in for the Canoga Park food pantry. “Christ said, ‘When you do this for the least of me, you will do this for me also.’ ” The Rev. Tricia Lowe of Emmanuel Lutheran Church in North Hollywood, and the Rev. Charles “Chuck” Bunnell of St. Andrews and Prince of Peace Lutheran churches, also took to the field with admonitions to help those in need. “Jesus tells us in Matthew, ‘I was hungry and you led me, I was homeless and you housed me, I was sick and you visited me,’’ Bunnell said. “Jesus tells us, ‘Feed the hungry.’ “Maybe we can do something with this hellish situation with the homeless.” Click here to subscribe to Digital & Home Delivery - 50% off About the Author Reach the author at dana.bartholomew@dailynews.com or follow Dana on Twitter: @DN_DanaBart.

The recent outages at Delta, Southwest, and indeed not so widely reported but at other airlines should be a wake-up call for the whole airline industry. With profits at their greatest ever, why has the comfort of passengers been sacrificed to airline IT shortcuts and failures? This is a question a lot of people should be and indeed are asking.   I will lay out four core reasons.   #1 Lack of investment in information technology (IT).   Airlines invest significantly in their core (aircraft and airport) technologies. Yet their IT investment lags the conventional industrial average significantly. At a time when airlines have been indeed making great profits across the board, airlines have stubbornly refused to spend more on their IT. Delta’s Ed Bastian is quoted as saying the airline has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in IT, yet he fails to see that the industry-leading carrier should, in truth, be investing at a higher rate. Indeed, with no new decent technologies on the horizon that the airlines can adopt (see reason #2 below), they are happy to operate on the principles of both “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” and “as long as the other guys aren’t doing it, why should we?” Delta’s recent outage was a minor system failure that could have been kept minor with simple backup systems. Someone in IT architecture needs their head examined for failure to anticipate the impact of the single point of failure. Bastian’s quote, “This isn’t who we are”, rings hollow. It is exactly who Delta is – i.e. a member of a laggard cluster of very powerful players who should be spending more and delivering more to their customer base.   #2 GDS/PSS giants don’t want it.   With Amadeus and Sabre now controlling the vast majority of airline reservations systems — meaning, passenger service systems (PSS) and related airline IT — and GDS-based, indirect distribution systems, they feel they are under no pressure to upgrade these systems. Sure they have updated the silicon (hardware), but the processes of airline-based IT are still founded on systems based on one-way messaging and telex-based processing designed in the 1950s. Real-time, massively scaled offer-and-sale mechanisms are just not present. Instead we have “faked”* states of what someone thinks an airline availability state is, but no guarantees. It is high time we dispensed with these old legacy systems. It’s not that this is impossible. It is that the fat cats are not willing to kill the fatted calf. (If I can mix my animal metaphors). The big PSS giants – add TravelSky to that list – are all based on the same antiquated technology designs and processes. To make matters even worse, the contracts that exist on both the PSS and GDS side are shamefully restrictive to ensure that the airlines and their users have an actual disincentive to change the technology. (In the Delta incident, IBM’s Transaction Processing Facility, or TPF, was implicated in the blame by Reuters but this was not confirmed by the airline.)   #3 Fear of the unknown and the herd mentality.   The airline industry has operated as a club for many years – when it suits it. Innovation is always held hostage to operational excellence. Airlines who were early adopters of technology have now become laggards in embracing new technologies. The fear of change as seen in the slow adoption and the continued resistance to NDC is an example. For the airlines, they don’t want to have to deal with the process of change. For the intermediaries, there is not just a fear of change by a systemic bias against change. True there will be a lot of disruption with this change. But airlines need to get over themselves. Other industries who have just as many mission-critical systems in place have already done it. Oh, yes, I guess that reason #1 comes back into play. What is quite amusing here is that airlines now want to differentiate themselves. Therefore they need to embrace change. You cannot differentiate if you don’t think differently. The herd mentality must vanish.   #4 It’s complicated and time-consuming.   I would be remiss if I didn’t actually indicate that the whole processes of the industry and of its IT are REALLY complex and complicated. Much of it is self-induced pain. Simple processes take forever to implement. For small changes – the ROI frequently doesn’t get made because the process of adopting change is so hard and expensive. We need to bring back simplicity and ease of use and ease of change. It is not the customer who will not make the change it is the airline and its supplier stakeholders. The consumer has shown themselves to be quite adept at change.   Allow me to muse a little here.   All the wonderful new technologies the airlines crow about are really just at the periphery. Where the real work needs to be done is in the core. That is the selling systems and the inventory management systems. Airline selling systems are diabolically antiquated. Even the so-called real innovators in offer and sales management – companies like Farelogix, Datalex, OpenJaw, and our own Air Black Box — are still battling to bring modern retailing systems into general use. Conventional retailing giants like Tesco and Walmart must be laughing at our industry’s naivety. Perhaps not so loud, though, since they can’t get travel to work either! Companies involved in seat upgrades are as much of a symptom of the airline IT problem as an opportunity. It just shows how antiquated the technologies have become when a company exists to offer – an upgrade? That is not a company. It is hardly a product. It is a feature and should be so. With apologies to the companies trying to do this – I am sure it is a good idea but is it really one to build an entire company around?   As someone who has led multiple teams that have brought change to the airline and travel IT world, I am incredibly frustrated by the slow pace of change in the industry today. From our vantage point of being a small VC, we see some great technologies that cannot be implemented. It is almost heartbreaking to have to tell innovators that their idea cannot see the light of day. There is enough blame to go around. Perhaps now we can pay some serious attention to the requirement for change. And my prognosis? Unlikely to happen, but perhaps we can hope for some attention to it. A final thought. Beware. there are now powerful players eyeing this situation with relish. Unless the industry takes heed of this wake up call, then better providers will enter the market.   Thanks for reading. * RE: “faked” states… Priced availability as found in the initial results screen is not a true state of the real availability and associated pricing. It is an estimate without any form of trustworthiness behind it. This is well known to the consumer who wastes large amounts of computer resources in searching. There are a range of players doing this from Google to the GDSs. Earlier: Delta’s CEO offers the company’s view on the outage.

Required fields are marked * Comment Notify me of followup comments via e-mail Name * Email * Website Carla You are completely incorrect when you say that Amadeus’ PSS is based on legacy systems. They spent 500 million Euros of their own money (no airline partners to defray costs) to build a new generation PSS. Altea’s Inventory and Departure Control components are 100% open systems and their Reservations system has a small percentage of legacy programming. In my opinion, Amadeus technology is state of the art and leaps and bounds ahead of Sabre. Reply 3 months ago   Timothy O'Neil-Dunne I would beg to differ. The inventory system of Amadeus is build on BABS (technology) it acquired from British Airways many years ago. My point is that you are in part correct. the system has been developed and developed but it still built on core legacy principles – such as TELEX based message passing. Really are we still dealing with systems that require the operator to be right all the time? These are hardly current generation systems. As for that “Investment” from their own pocket. I suggest you should ask the airlines whether they believe that the money was pure “investment”. Much of that money was actually “development” used in maintaining the state of the system and its compliance with standards. As a result it is an accounting – some might say – sleight of hand to call it investment. To point the finger at saying one system – Amadeus – and say it is better than say Sabre, Travelport or Travelsky hides the point the article makes which is that these systems need to be replaced with newer technology which can boast greater functionality, be more reliable – AND – one heck of a lot cheaper solutions. Why they are not – is an interesting question. Keep pondering. I stand by this article. Amadeus is based on legacy systems – as are the others. What would be an interesting statement would be to hear one of the PSS and GDS players to demonstrate how their core functionality is as you say “completely” not based on legacy designs. I am arguing the case for the end of plodding evolution and the move to revolution in these systems. Thanks for your comment – it is appreciated. Reply 3 months ago   Murray Harrold The Delta outage was due to a power supply failure and an issue with (hardware) not going over to backup systems. Nothing wrong with the actual software. Previous outages (on other airlines) have been caused by such things as a failed router and a possum eating through a power cable. Seems to me, what is needed is a more reliable power supply. It is quite hard to ascertain exactly what caused this breakdown as most of the reported news seems to focus on the aftermath with a simple, generic, reference to “an outage”. According to some reports, It may be that the installation of a better smoke detector may solve the issue – and perhaps finding a better way of covering power cables. Even if the “much talked about but not actually produced very much” new distribution thing finally – ever comes about – or indeed anything else – if something or someone hits the “Off” switch or chews through a power cable, the result would be pretty much the same. It really bugs our tech brethern that airlines are perfectly able to run their airlines on tech built on 1980’s -ish tech. As an end user (or, perhaps, “first user”) of such systems (in my case, Sabre) I can say that the system works stunningly well. We seem to have managed to encompass bag fees, seat fees … most new requirements without any fuss, we have fare displays showing what is and is not included – above all, we still have a neutral display which gives accurate – and above all, “raw” – information quickly and clearly. It is easy to manipulate that information without the encuberance of tedious “point and click” and irrelevant marketing encuberances cluttering up any screens. So, please, we point the finger, lets not blame failures on “legacy” systems. Let’s find out the facts, first – which in this Delta instance seem to point more at the power company than they do at the airline. Reply 3 months ago   Timothy O'Neil-Dunne Delta specifically said that the issue was not the power company (Georgia Power). As most users – one can expect the thing to work until it doesnt. This was one of those times. Should a higher expectation be provided that the system should be more reliable? Yes. For the tens of thousands of disadvantaged travellers (as opposed to the few Travel Agents who were affected) this is something that they should have expected from the affected carrier. It is high time the airlines and the GDSs change their IT. The argument that Mr Harold puts forward that says “if it aint broke dont fix it” it a bit like saying the horse remains a fine form of transportation. Reply 3 months ago   Paul Byrne from Reuters http://www.reuters.com/article/us-delta-air-outages-it-analysis-idUSKCN10N1A3 Reply 3 months ago   Timothy O'Neil-Dunne I would like to thank those of you who read the article and have responded. Please take this to heart inside your organizations. Airlines and their IT vendors need to listen and actually do something. it is interesting to note that certain US Senators are asking the same questions. Reply 3 months ago   Ahtesham Interesting article. Reply 3 months ago   Paul Byrne Certainly agree with the gist of this article. Now, when record profits are being realised, is surely the time for investing in IT, rearchitecting, creating best-of-breed solution. However, ‘fear of the unknown’, legacy systems with all types of dependent systems and business processes, all play into the ‘if it ain’t broken’ mindset. Airlines need to experiment, build-learn-evolve, see what works, dump what doesn’t – this mentality starts at the top, from the CEO down. Every failure is a learning experience and not punishable by immediate sacking! Sure – airline systems are complicated – start with one system – make (a part of) it simpler – repeat the process – a recipe for innovation! Reply 3 months ago   Anil Bhatia Very well put Timothy and as always. Good read. However, I do feel the main point seems to have been missed out where in the C-suite of any company is the one responsible to bring in the paradigm mind change in the way things need to be done differently. In most cases as you have mentioned, IT is outsourced to third party providers who look at airlines as cash cows. It is not the IT department to be blamed but the entire top brass who fail to look at the strategic picture or risk that paradigm change in mind set of running the business, differently. Reply 3 months ago   Timothy O'Neil-Dunne I look at this as an opportunity for someone who sits in the C-Suite who will actually sit up and take notice. It actually pains me to see Bastian having to deliver his apologia without necessarily considering that someone would actually challenge his statement. We have – as an industry – swept this under the carpet for far too long. I for one am going to actually try and do something about it. Who is with me? Reply 3 months ago   Daniel Polishuk IT modernization must catch up with business and organization modernization. The airline industry has had several great achievements lately, but is at risk of hubris. Very eye-opening article. Reply 3 months ago   Bill Hopping A lot of truth in this article. With respect to DL, I wonder if they still on a sort of shared platform with Worldspan GDS from Northwest, or running a separate instance with some shared infrastructure which I believe is called Deltamatic. Old PSS systems either way, and who knows how much they can be innovated, even if the development resources are there. I thought Amadeus touted that its PSS systems and GDS no longer rely on TPF coding. Reply 3 months ago   Timothy O'Neil-Dunne Sorry Bill I should have replied to this one. Deltamatic was never on the same platform as PARS (then Worldspan). Even though they were in the same building (owned by DL) it was run on entirely separate platform. (Hitachi Data Systems nee Amdahl) in another part of the data center. While the PSS vendors have told us that they no longer rely on TPF code. That is mostly true. The problem is that the architecture is still built on the same philosophy as if TPF existed. The PSS/GDS vendors missed a trick when they redid their designs. The result? Same complexity. Same issues. It is quite amazing that the designs were so robust that they have survived all this time. However, this does not excuse why those designs have not been replaced with modern based systems. The answer is self evident. Unlike today’s modern complex systems which are easier to uncouple and replace – these legacy systems are so embedded within the infrastructure of the technology stack that it is almost impossible to address without just a massive effort that these technology providers are just unwilling to address.

Todd Campbell (TMFEBCapital) Oct 1, 2016 at 12:01PM Image source: Getty Images. If you're a retiree worrying over the high cost of healthcare, you're not alone. Healthcare costs are increasing faster than prices for other goods and services and that's taxing seniors, especially those who are relying heavily on Social Security income. In the past year, medical costs are up 4.9%, yet Social Security income is unchanged. Therefore, rising costs are pressuring retiree budgets. To relieve some of that pressure, consider these money-saving tips. They may just help you stretch your healthcare dollars further in 2017. Capitalize on a younger spouse If your spouse isn't signed up for Medicare yet and he or she is insured via a high-deductible health insurance plan, consider the benefits associated with your spouse establishing a health savings account, or HSA. Although you can't contribute to an HSA once you're on Medicare, your spouse can. In 2017, your spouse can contribute up to $7,750 to an HSA account ($6,750 plus a $1,000 catch-up contribution) and as long as that money is used for your qualified medical expenses, it will be tax free. Unused money in an HSA can be rolled forward into future years, too. That means that an HSA can reduce the risk of needing to draw down taxable retirement savings, such as traditional IRAs, for future healthcare expenses. HSAs can also allow more money to grow tax-deferred for heirs. It can prevent IRA withdrawals from spiking your income and causing your future Medicare Part B premiums to be subject to income-related premium adjustments, too. Prepare for the future Baby boomers are living longer than ever before and while that's great news, it also means that more baby boomers will require long-term care at some point during their lifetime. Unfortunately, long-term healthcare is outlandishly expensive, and in most cases it isn't covered by Medicare. A home health aide or assisted living can cost $3,800 per month and a semi-private room in a nursing home can cost $6,800 per month, according to Genworth Financial. Moreover, while Medicaid can pay for long-term care, qualifying for Medicaid means spending down virtually all of your savings and Medicaid can put a lien on your home to recoup any expenses incurred on your behalf. Instead or rolling the dice on long-term care, a better strategy could be to get a long-term care insurance policy. Long-term care insurance isn't cheap, but neither is long-term care. Since 70% of people turning 65 can expect to require at least some long-term care during their lifetime, the odds are that this insurance will pay off at some point. If you do decide to sign up for a long-term care policy, sign up when you're younger, rather than when you're older. You're more likely to get approved when you're younger and you could end up paying less for your coverage. Close Medicare's gaps Medicare Part A and Part B plans provide a vital safety-net for seniors, but they don't pay all of a retiree's healthcare expenses. Part A covers hospitalization costs, but it requires a $1,288 deductible for each hospitalization benefit period and after 60 days of hospitalization, patients are subject to co-insurance. After 90 days, co-insurance rates double until an individual's 60 reserve days are used up, and after that, patients can be on the hook for all of their hospital costs. Part B pays for basic healthcare services, such as doctor visits and lab work, but it also requires a small annual deductible and 20% patient cost-sharing. Neither Part A or Part B cap the out-of-pocket spending for recipients in a given year, either. Since no one knows when an illness or an injury may strike and Medicare has "gaps" in its coverage, it could pay-off to purchase a Medigap plan. There are 10 different types of Medigap plans and each offers slightly different coverage. The most common plan chosen by retirees is Medigap Plan F, which is the most comprehensive. The coverage that's provided to original Medicare recipients by Plan F has to be the same from insurer to insurer, but prices of these plans vary depending on which premium calculation method is used by the insurer. For example, Medigap Plan F premiums in New Hampshire range between $173 and $357 per month. That's a pretty big range, so make sure to shop around. Dig into the details Medicare allows you to change Medicare Advantage and Part D plans during open enrollment and that open enrollment period runs between Oct. 15 and Dec. 7 this year. Medicare Advantage and Part D plans are offered by private insurers and that means your insurance coverage provided and premiums can change significantly from year to year. If your plan premium is set to increase in 2017, now's a great time to take a look at your other options. When you do, pay particular attention to whether or not any changes have been made to how your insurer will cover the cost of your medications. How much you pay for prescriptions depends on where medicines are placed within insurer's drug tiers. New drug approvals and negotiated discounts can lead to that placement changing every year. Insurers are also turning increasingly to coinsurance from flat-rate co-payments for prescriptions, which can cause your drug costs to spike. To avoid unwelcome surprises at the pharmacy counter, compile a list of all your medications and then dive into the details of the various plans available to you. Doing so could end up saving you more money. Hunt for bargains If you've been relying on the same pharmacy for years, you might want to call around to check prices charged by competitors. Some big box retailers, including Costco and Wal-Mart offer special prices on many generic drugs. A Consumer Reports study of prices of popular drugs found that Costco had the lowest cash prices overall, so that may be a good place to start. Another option is to visit GoodRx.com, an online website that provides local price information as well as coupons. Paying for your prescriptions, rather than running them through your insurance, could end up saving you a bundle. Similarly, you may be able to reduce your out-of-pocket Part B expenses by shopping around for healthcare services. For example, in-store healthcare clinics can provide less costly care than an emergency room visit for non-emergencies that happen outside of doctor's hours.

Jerry Brown’s and the Legislature’s move to shut down redevelopment in California and seize $1.7 billion in redevelopment funds from local agencies around the state, Brown’s crusade won cheers from many of the state’s pundit class. They saw the diversion of some property tax revenues to well-connected developers in the name of improving “blighted” areas as akin to crony capitalism, and many also didn’t like the frequent use of eminent domain to seize land for redevelopment projects. But Brown never really made clear if he shared this critique — or if he just thought that during a budget crisis, the $1.7 billion he could take could be put to better use. He had used redevelopment while mayor of Oakland, but he also had to be aware of redevelopment abuses involving dubious blight declarations and the diversion of 12 percent of all state property taxes to various redevelopment projects.  Now it is clear that Brown was driven by fiscal pressures. Last year, he signed Assembly Bill 2, which allows local governments to expand and better fund entities called a “Community Revitalization and Investment Authorities.” Last week, he signed AB2492, a companion bill that defines circumstances in which local taxes can be diverted for which projects — and it appears to encourage the same sort of mischievous declarations of blight that drove critics mad in redevelopment’s previous California incarnation. Both were authored by Assemblyman Luis A. Alejo, D-Salinas. Successful businesses could be declared blighted Under the latter measure, blight can be declared — and land seized for economic development purposes — if median income in a defined area is lower than 80 percent of the median income either “statewide, countywide or citywide.” Critics such as Marko Mlikotin of the California Alliance to Protect Private Property Rights say this would give developers and their political allies a tool to declare many thriving businesses, churches or public offices as blighted so their land could be conveyed to the developers for projects that are pitched as helping the local economy. Such diversions were allowed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2005 on a 5-4 vote in the Kelo v. New London case. Chris Norby, a former state assemblyman, Orange County supervisor and Fullerton mayor, chronicled the misuses of redevelopment in California in his 44-page 2007 analysis, “Redevelopment: The Unknown Government.” Here’s a short excerpt: Redevelopment subsidies are not distributed evenly. Major developers, NFL team owners, giant discount stores, hotels and auto dealers receive most of the money. Small business owners now must face giant new competitors funded by their own taxes. … Costco [received] over $30 million in subsidies in Orange County alone, extrapolated to $300 million statewide. Wal-Mart has gotten over $1 billion in public handout nationwide, with an estimated $100 million in California. Pro sports also profit from lavish subsidies. The Raiders got $7 million from Irwindale just for opening negotiations on a new stadium site (never built). In 1995, the Raiders returned to Oakland, lured by $94 million in public subsidies. The Chargers have gotten $134 million in seat guarantee pay offs courtesy of San Diego taxpayers. While redevelopment apologists claim to be “rebuilding” our cities, barely 19 percent went for actual real estate development, and another 5 percent for land acquisition, much of it still vacant. Significantly, $580 million — 11 percent — was spent on administration, most of it for redevelopment staff salaries. This provides a lucrative bureaucratic base that redevelopment staffers seek to preserve and expand. Poor families evicted at developers’ behest Norby’s research showed that many cities targeted areas with inexpensive housing for redevelopment, forcing evictions and reducing housing stock. When Anaheim “improved” its working class Jeffrey-Lynne neighborhood, it forced existing apartment owners to sell to Southern California Housing Corp. Half of the units were demolished, over 400 tenants evicted and those that remained saw their rents doubled. Public subsidy: $54 million. The Brea Redevelopment Agency demolished its entire downtown residential area, using eminent domain to force out hundreds of lower-income residents. Much of its housing money has since been spent on mixed-use projects that are really more commercial than residential. The agency gave $649,000 in housing funds to a largely retail development that will include only eight loft apartments. Some of Norby’s criticisms were confirmed by a 2011 Legislative Analyst’s Office report. Defenders of redevelopment counter that bad projects shouldn’t be held against good projects. The redevelopment of San Diego’s Gaslamp area downtown is often held up as the crown jewel of California redevelopment. In the 1970s, the area was crime-ridden and seedy. Now it is a haven for towering hotels, trendy restaurants and bars, and the Petco Park baseball stadium. Many cities which rely heavily on sales taxes for revenues also tout their use of redevelopment to open up “Mile of Cars”-style areas full of lucrative vehicle dealerships.

I spent twenty-five years fighting redevelopment, working towards a goal of total abolition nationwide. Not many people understand that in order to put this egregious practice (public money and eminent domain for private use) out of its misery, the entire body of federal, state and local legislation and court rulings called “Redevelopment Law” will need to be repealed. These laws suspend the rights of some citizens for the benefit of others on the pretext of eliminating “blight”, which is blatantly described therein as property that public officials determine isn’t generating as much tax revenue as they think it should. I am not making this up. Blight is defined as physical, social and economic decay, a threat to the health sand safety of the American people so dire it justifies suspending people’s rights and Liberty to eliminate. In this equation, the American people are not considered to be our nation’s greatest asset, but its greatest liability. Redevelopment as it is practiced today (it is not an American tradition, despite what its proponents claim) began when Congress passed the Housing Act of 1949 which transferred a hated federal program to the States. California’s Community Redevelopment Law [Health & Safety Code Sec. 33000 et seq.] was adopted by the Legislature in 1952 and voters approved a Constitutional Amendment [Article XVI, Sec. 16] allowing local governments to use tax increment financing to pay for redevelopment projects the following year. Since then, voters have approved other constitutional amendments, like Prop. 22, that extend these powers. In 2011 when Brown signed the bill to shut down California’s 400-odd Community Redevelopment Agencies, they did not repeal any of these laws. The project areas were not shut down, though, and they are still receiving property tax increment revenue to pay off what is left of redevelopment’s monumental debt. Although the anti-redevelopment movement is bi-partisan, in 2011 Republicans (except for Chris Norby) opposed shutting down the CRAs, maintaining the odd position that public debt and eminent domain abuse are good for the economy. It is my opinion that fighting this outrage one project at a time, one city at a time, or one state at a time takes as much energy as working toward a nationwide movement for a Constitutional Amendment banning the use of public money and eminent domain for private development. My hope is that everyone who steps up to the plate to stop their local redevelopment agency (or, as they will now be called in California, “Revitalization Authority”) from bulldozing people’s rights away will use every battle to argue for nationwide abolition. This is how America’s 19th-century abolitionists eventually succeeded in putting a stop to slavery. It can be done. Reply this comment Write a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

According to the Daily Beast, Eric is raising eyebrows because of the reported $880,000 that Trump’s so-called “The Eric Trump Foundation” charity spent at Trump-owned golf resorts. However, Eric claims that all of the Trump Foundation money goes 100 percent toward altruistic causes. However, those altruistic causes include plastic surgery, a painting of Donald with a blue dog, wine and lavish Trump-owned golf resort spending sprees. The Eric Trump Foundation is headed by Eric — Donald’s third-born child. The Eric Trump Foundation has paid plenty of money for events at Trump’s golf courses as fundraisers. As a result of the hubbub — and even prior to the Daily Beast reporting their findings — Eric’s foundation’s Facebook page is garnering negative reviews. Facebook user Bruce Teel reviewed The Eric Trump Foundation and gave it one star on August 25. Teel urged people to give to charities of their choice directly, instead of filtering it through Eric’s foundation. “More money goes into Trumps’ pocket than to the charity. Save your money and donate directly to St. Jude. Only way to guarantee your money gets to the people who need it.” Facebook user Feliciano Jose Sanchez also reviewed The Eric Trump Foundation and also gave it one star on September 1, at 8:04 p.m. Feliciano questioned the legitimacy of the five-star reviews on Eric’s foundation’s Facebook page. “Did you know that this charity isn’t in the charity navigator..because it doesn’t qualify to be…some suspicious stuff here.hmm..these are all bogus. I’ve never never in my life seen five star reviews for anyone..not even Walmart stores or Target. This page has excellent reviews..lmao.” Although Eric’s foundation claims that they donate from 95 to 100 percent of the donations received, a whopping $188,000 was given directly to a firm of a Trump “family member of the Board of Directors.” Donald’s foundation has already faced accusations of how his foundation’s donations have been spent — now Eric seems to be facing the same firing squad in terms of foundation donation spending and ethics. The foundation buzz isn’t the only reason Donald has been in the news lately. [Photo by Ed Bailey/AP Images] Donald Trump can be seen in the above photo that’s nearly 30 years old. Trump was photographed on May 19, 1988, along with the famous actress Jane Krakowski. Trump was also joined at Wollman Rink in New York’s Central Park that day with other Broadway stars like April Allen and John Schiappa — performers who did not join Trump in what’s being called Trump’s soft porn sex tape cameo. As reported by Newser, after Trump’s Twitter rant against Alicia Machado included accusations of a sex tape, people dug up Donald’s own appearance in the 2000 Playboy soft porn movie. Trump is shown in a brief video that’s NSFW, according to BuzzFeed, popping a Champagne bottle. The sex tape goes on to display the ladies naked and smothering themselves in honey, taking baths and more NSFW stuff. [Photo by Kathy Willens/AP Images] But it’s Eric’s foundation that is causing buzz like the below comments on social media. “The crooked apple doesn’t fall far from the rotting tree.” “The whole family is corrupt.” “Like father like son, foundation used as Trump bank to pay off bills.” “Why believe the truth about Trump when you can suspect a Clinton?” “I don’t think Eric understands the meaning of the word ‘courage’. The whole family seems to want to bastardization the English language.” “If you think this country has a large deficit now, just let these crooks get ahold of it.” “Glad they’re putting supporters hard earned money to good use!! Wake the F up Meric.” [Featured Photo by Evan Agostini/AP Images] Now Watch This: Biden and Obama Memes Take Over The Internet Now Read This: Man’s Drone Catches Cheating Wife Of 18 Years: 9 Million YouTube Video Views, Update — What’s The Real Story?

(Photo: Rick T. Wilking/Pool image via AP) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Holt failed as moderator Re: First presidential debate on Sept. 26 Whether one believes in Clinton or Trump, regarding this debate I truly believe that Lester Holt was the loser. He had little or no control of the candidates, their timing or over timing. Whatever the subject all could be misconstrued or misinterpreted. Perhaps we need to “vote” for a stronger mediator? Patricia Craine, Palm Springs A question of priorities What’s more important for our country? Donald Trump’s tax returns or what was in those 33,000 emails destroyed after being subpoenaed by the Feds? Stanley Rhea, Rancho Mirage Not impressed with Trump Anyone who thinks Donald Trump won the first (and I hope only) debate must need to see a psychologist, a psychiatrist, or go back to pre-school. Ray Nolen, Cathedral City Not so ‘smart,’ Mr. Trump My father emigrated to Canada from Russia. He worked hard, went to school and provided a nice middle class life for his family. He loved his adopted country and often said that it was an honor to pay income tax to the country that had given him so many opportunities. Fast forward to the big debate during which Hillary Clinton stated that Donald Trump paid no income taxes. Trump’s response was one word, “smart.” There’s no doubt that Trump is smart. But does he not have the vision to understand that without income tax there would be no military, no health care, no education, no airports, no roads and no police? Perhaps Trump is satisfied that his employees pay income tax that provide him with the benefits of a civilized country. John Fitzgerald Kennedy got it. On Jan. 21, 1961 at his inauguration, J.F.K. said, “ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.” I wonder what kind of a president Donald J. Trump will make when he thinks it’s smart for Americans to avoid contributing to their country. Larry Shapiro, Rancho Mirage The Trump implosion For all of you Trump fans: Does it not bother you that Donald Trump is up all night tweeting about sex tapes? Should he not be thinking and cramming for the next debate? Hillary was right; just get under his thin skin a bit and he will implode. Ingrid Robertshaw, Rancho Mirage Cathedral City, reject charter On Nov. 8 I am going to vote. I value my right to vote and always have. However, I will lose my right to vote for Cathedral City mayor if Measure HH is approved. The Cathedral City Council has asked voters to decide if we should change our form of city government from a General Law city to a Charter city. I have serious issues with the way this charter law has been written. The charter is written so that my right to vote for our mayor and other issues (including financial issues that govern our city) will be denied. This document is flawed in so many ways it’s difficult to count. If you have not read this document, or do not have an understanding of how it will change the way our city is governed, please vote no. This charter is flawed and not ready for prime time. Gloria Cromer, Cathedral City CV Link key to election Palm Desert’s City Council has been asked to put city participation in the CV Link before voters. Members have refused. I can see them believing they are elected to make decisions for residents, but when it comes to decisions with 50- and 100-year expense commitments, I believe, as with bond issues and sales tax increases, voters ought to have a say. We need representatives that believe in the democratic processes residents deserve. I also strongly believe that if Indian Wells does not allow the CV Link through its city and since Rancho Mirage will not have any portion of the Link, we in Palm Desert should not have a link from nowhere and to nowhere. I urge you to contact candidates Jerry Martin, Kathleen Kelly and Gina Nestande, the newcomers, and ask them if elected will they commit to getting us residents a chance to vote on the CV Link. It really doesn’t matter if they are for or against the Link; what matters is that we are given an opportunity to weigh in. Our vote is one of our most important rights and we need to fight against anyone who would take away this right Tom Wells, Palm Desert Sewell for COD Yes, this is a senior-centric community. Yes, it’s hard to think of schools and education when we have been done with that for years. But communities thrive when our youth are educated and prepared for life. Our youth have a respect for their communities when they feel supported. We have amazing and talented students that need just that – our support. In this case, support is spelled “Breanna Sewell for COD Trustee Area 2.” Breanna is a fellow Rotarian and a friend. She believes in truth, integrity, fairness, good will, and all benefiting from her decisions. I believe she can make the difference our valley needs. Your vote for Breanna is a vote for our community! Mary Sawyer, Palm Desert, president, Rotary Club of Rancho Mirage Hendrix right for PS Unified I am writing this letter in support of Kari Middleton Hendrix’s candidacy to the Palm Springs Unified School Board. Hendrix and I grew up in the desert and have been friends since sixth grade when we attended Nellie N. Coffman, Palm Springs High School, and then college at UC San Diego together. Although I do not reside in the desert, I keep many ties to the community as my nieces attend Cielo Vista Charter School with Kari’s daughter and we are both very active in helping raise monies for the school. Kari knows the desert well, has been educated through it, and is now educating her children therein. She is knowledgeable, intelligent, has a lot of experience and ties to the community, and the fact that she is a parent with a finance background will certainly be an asset to the parents and families that want a passionate voice on the board to represent their interests. For these reasons, it is with great pleasure that I endorse Hendrix for the Palm Springs School Board. Angelica M. Leon, Esq., Beverly Hills This will change spending As an outsider, let me comment on the proposed increase in La Quinta sales tax. We spend approximately $6,000 at La Quinta Costco and several more thousands at Walmart. My guess is that a 1-percentage-point increase in sales tax would cost me about $100 a year. That is the price of a couple of nice dinners. Result: We will shift our purchases. A small loss for La Quinta but maybe multiplied by thousands of other people doing the same thing. Edward Carr, Palm Desert Assurances lacking on La Quinta tax After reading two letters (George Batavick, Sept. 27, and Doug Hassett, Sept. 28) in The Desert Sun supporting the sales tax increase in La Quinta, I thought a quick counterreply might be in order. I believe Batavick is following through as a committee member and doing what I think the committee was formed to do: push the tax increase. I might agree with Hassett if his “blue-sky” approach provided even a shred of assurance that overspending by the city would end and that none of the new sales tax revenue is spent on the CV Link, a money-drain for decades to come. Did anyone happen to notice La Quinta citizens are not being given the chance to vote in November on the CV Link? Could it be the city has committed to squander our tax dollars, including the new 1 point, on this imprudent and foolhardy project? November elections are looming large so it’s time to make some easy choices for elected La Quinta officials who will actually listen to and act as we the people wish. Dan McClary, La Quinta La Quinta needs Measure G Hey, old timers in La Quinta! Remember when we had high crime rates, no building codes and no code compliance? That was called “before incorporation.” Is that what we want to return to? A no vote on Measure G would set us way back. Yet, recent letters from a few vocal old timers regarding La Quinta’s Measure G say vote no, with reasons full of inaccuracies and baseless innuendos. The majority of the 14-member Advisory Committee was tax averse at the beginning but after studying the City’s financial condition came to consensus and recommended several revenue and expenditure actions, including the sales tax increase. These volunteers came from all walks of life; no one was turned away. Where were those citizen critics then? After studying the city’s finances and operations for months, the committee concluded the city was well-managed and had already taken several of its recommended steps to develop new revenues and contain expenditures. A 2015 community-based study of our police department led to staff reallocations. Unfortunately, the unions are the entities that are asking for the 7 percent raise over the next few years. Vote Yes on Measure G.

Copay coupons or cards have become a ubiquitous part of the pharmaceutical business, offered through websites, mobile apps and doctors’ offices. Patient advocates say they can bring down out-of-pocket expenses for patients who face high copays and deductibles. Mylan last month boosted its discount cards to cover $300 of insured patients’ copay costs, up from $100. But they also have a clear business purpose: steering people toward brand-name drugs when cheaper options are often available. Researchers say those higher costs ultimately drive up expenses for insurers, employers and the health system at large. A look at the pros and cons of copay discount cards: Pro: Lower out-of-pocket costs As more employers move to cost-sharing health plans, their workers face higher expenses when filling prescriptions at the pharmacy. The average amount owed by a patient picking up a brand-name drug is $44, according to IMS Health, a health information company. Copay coupons usually offer reimbursement up to a certain level, such as $100. Advocates say copay coupons are crucial for financially strapped people. Erin Singleton of the Patient Advocate Foundation says she directs patients to websites like needymeds.org and pparx.org, which compile coupon offers. To qualify, patients generally have to provide information about their insurance. But unlike some other patient assistance programs that offer free medicines or deep discounts, the coupons are not tied to income. “Copay cards are beneficial because they’re pretty seamless,” Singleton said. “It is something that should be considered regardless of your income.” Con: Higher-priced drugs While consumers pay less at the pharmacy, research suggests they are actually passing on higher costs to their insurance company. That’s because manufacturers tend to offer the coupons on brand-name drugs that are competing against lower-priced drugs, often generics that sell for $4 or less at retailers like Walmart. When a generic is available, pharmacists often automatically switch patients to the cheaper option. But when a patient uses a coupon, it short-circuits that process. The copay is lower, but the insurer ends up paying for the higher-priced drug. “So those costs are going to come out in higher premiums,” said Wells Wilkinson, an attorney with Community Catalyst, a health care advocate group. A 2013 study of almost 400 coupons found that nearly two-thirds were for brand-name medications that had cheaper alternatives, according to researchers at Harvard Medical School. Pro: Prescriptions filled An estimated 1 in 5 prescriptions in the U.S. goes unfilled, in part due to financial hardship. Some research suggests patients with copay discounts are more likely to stay on their medication than those without them. One 2014 study of patients taking high-priced specialty drugs for multiple sclerosis and other inflammatory diseases found that nearly half of them used a copay coupon. In most cases, the discounts reduced their monthly expenses to less than $250, a threshold where patients are more likely to stay on their medication. Con: short-term solution Coupon cards can improve access to drugs, but usually for a limited time. Most cards include language that they can only be reused 12 times or that they expire after 14 months. Across all brand-name prescriptions filled in the U.S., copay coupons are only used about 8 percent of the time, according to research published last year by IMS Health. Limiting their use: Many mail order pharmacy programs do not accept the cards. Additionally, the cards cannot be used at all by patients in federal health plans like Medicare, Medicaid or Veterans Affairs, which cover tens of millions of Americans. The cards run afoul of federal anti-kickback laws that prohibit companies from giving enrollees anything of value to purchase items paid for by the government. When drugmakers like Mylan tout their discount cards as a remedy for rising drug prices, experts say it deflates public debate about medication costs that could lead to real reforms. “Coupons are not a public health solution, they are a minor fix for a small number of people,” said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, a professor at Harvard Medical School.

However, a ballooning pension deficit will cast a shadow over an otherwise upbeat set of half year results with analysts forecastingTesco to confirm its black hole to have doubled to £5bn. The widening of the pension deficit, caused by falling bond yields since Brexit and the Bank of England’s rate cut, is expected to delay the resumption of a dividend, last paid in 2015, as reported by the Sunday Telegraph last week. Analysts at Bernstein expect Tesco to post pre-tax profits of £333m for the six months to the end of August, compared to the £74m recorded last year. The City is also forecasting a range of like-for-like sales between 0.5pc and 1pc, proving there is momentum behind Tesco’s return to growth. The retailer posted a 0.3pc lift in like-for-like sales in the last quarter. “Tesco is recovering slowly but surely”, HSBC analyst Dave McCarthy said. “It’s range review exercise - which reduced the number of duplicate products on shelves - is one of a number of simple steps which are helping to improve its underlying sales performance.” Tesco share price Dave Lewis, who took the helm in October 2014, is steering Tesco around on what he calls a “volume-based recovery” designed to end the erosion of its market share by boosting sales.  Mr Lewis became chief executive just days before a £263m accounting scandal plunged Tesco into its biggest ever crisis and led the supermarket to last year report the largest ever loss recorded by a UK company. At the same time, the supermarket has been battling changing shopping habits and the rise of German low-cost rivals. Earlier this year Mr Lewis – the first outsider to run Tesco since Sir Jack Cohen started a market stall in east London in 1919 – took the fight back to discounters Aldi and Lidl by investing heavily in a range of farm food brands. While the range was criticised by commentators and the National Farmers Union for using fictional British-sounding names on imported produce, the cheaper meat and vegetable lines have boosted sales and been popular with customers. Tesco is winning back shoppers Analysts at Barclays– Tesco’s house broker - are predicting the supermarket to post an operating margin of 1.5pc, compared to the 0.8pc last year but below the 1.6pc in the second half of last year, due to the grocer’s investment in its farm brands. The improving margin will be well received by the City as a further sign that a recovery is on track, despite the intensely competitive environment. A recent management shake-up at rival Asda had stirred fears of a bitter price war that could eviscerate profit margins across the food sector. However, retail experts have been encouraged by early signals that new Asda boss Sean Clarke will respect parent Walmart’s commitment to profitability rather than engage in an price slashing company which analysts at HSBC likened to Defcon One. Recent figures from Kantar also revealed Tesco’s best performance for two years, with the grocer recording a 0.2pc dip in total sales over the 12 weeks to 11 September, helped by a promotion on Prosecco during the Olympics. During the year Mr Lewis has increased his focus on Tesco’s core supermarket estate by overseeing a string of sell-offs including coffee chain Harris & Hoole, garden centre chain Dobbies, restaurant chain Giraffe and a 95pc stake in Turkish business Kipa although these sales are not expected to have significantly impacted the company’s balance sheet. A source close to the business referred to the sales as being “incremental”. Tesco’s profit and sales recovery comes after a trio of former Tesco directors will appear at Southwark Crown Court later this month on fraud charges relating to the supermarket’s black hole. Chris Bush, 50, Carl Rogberg, 49, and John Scouler, 48, all pleaded not guilty at a preliminary hearing last month to two charges brought by the Serious Fraud Office.

Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (9) The night before Karl Meltzer decided to gut out the last 85 miles without a break on a grueling 2,190-mile trail run journey through 14 states, he turned to his crew chief Eric Belz and said: "I can smell the barn." "The first week, you could just see it in Karl's eyes," Belz said. "He had this twinkle of determination that 'this is my time to shine, I'm breaking the record this time, nothing is going to stop me.'" Just before 4 a.m. the 48-year-old Sandy resident and world class ultrarunner began his "child's play" of an 85-mile homestretch in a record-setting thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail — 45 days, 22 hours and 38 minutes of speed hiking through the heat, humidity, mountains and woods from Maine to Georgia — to best the previous record by more than 10 hours. VIDEOS TOP JOBS After attempts in 2008 and 2014, Meltzer completed a dream on Sept. 18, born from hiking the "A.T." as a kid in New Hampshire and honed by a fateful run to Cecret Lake in the summer of 1990. Meltzer moved to Utah in 1989 to be a self-described "ski bum," but the trail running bug bit him the following summer when he went for a run to the lake while he was working at Snowbird. "I didn't know the trails. I was exploring a new place all the time, so the buzz was there for sure," Meltzer said. "I just kept doing it and evolved into running shorter races, then longer races and it evolved into a real career." Meltzer, nicknamed "Speedgoat," is the winningest 100-mile runner on Earth with 38 victories, topping the Wasatch 100 six times. He finished running the A.T. in 2008 in 54 days without breaking the record and dropped out of an attempt after falling behind record pace in 2014, the task of besting the record becoming an obsession. Last September, Meltzer returned to Maine for some southbound practice on the trail, running 263 miles in six days to prepare for an attempt to best Scott Jurek's northbound record from 2015. "We talked about it a little bit more, did more recon, did more time on the trail, spent a lot more effort putting together the right team," Meltzer said. "Lo and behold, it happens this year and I was successful." After driving out from Utah, Belz and Meltzer found a campground near Mount Katahdin in Maine and the runner took off in the morning on Aug. 3. "Karl said if the weather is good, I'm going first thing in the morning," Belz said. "Me knowing Karl, I knew he was leaving that next morning because the weather was perfect." Meltzer said the conditions were ideal for the first 19 days, helping him to maintain a 44-mile-per-day pace. Every day, Belz woke him up, laid out the daily journey itinerary, and fed him breakfast, and Meltzer was out of the van and on his way by 5 a.m. "Everything was really lining up and falling into place for me," Meltzer said. "The start was fantastic and I really wasn't working extra hard to get to those miles that I needed to get to." Belz and the rest of his crew met him every eight to 10 miles — sometimes stretching to 15 or 20 — driving around 100 miles per day while Metallica and Megadeth CDs from Walmart kept Belz company in the "hurry up and wait" role as Meltzer's crew chief. "It was a lot mentally. I'll admit, I was a little nervous going into this project because I did feel like I had a lot riding on my shoulders with getting this guy to the record," Belz, who has crewed for Meltzer on many 100-mile races, said. "I didn't want to screw anything up." Despite his strong starting pace, as Day 20 dawned, Meltzer tweaked his shin in the New Jersey stretch, the injury aggravating in Pennsylvania into tendinitis and a shin splint — a segment he said was by far the roughest of the journey. "We would just treat it with anti-inflammatorys and a little bit less miles," Meltzer said. "I had a bit of a lead on the record pace about 19 days into it, so I had a few miles to give back. I certainly didn't want to do that, but I had to." Belz researched treatments and found that the best way to treat the injury was rest — a notion he knew Meltzer wouldn't remotely entertain.

(AP Photo/Don Boomer) EL CAJON, Calif.—The family of an unarmed black man fatally shot by police is like thousands who have transformed the suburban San Diego city of El Cajon: Refugees from a strife-torn country. The family of 38-year-old Alfred Olango fled Uganda to a refugee camp and then came to the United States in 1991. On Tuesday, Olango, a father of two girls, was killed by an officer who responded to calls from Olango’s sister saying her brother was acting erratically and wandering into traffic. He was shot multiple times after police say he pulled something from his pocket that they thought could be a weapon and pointed it at the officer. The object turned out to be a 4-inch electronic cigarette device. Related Coverage Rally, March in Memory of Man Shot by Police in California California Police Show Videos of Fatal Shooting of Black Man Police Chief: Alfred Olango, Man Shot Dead by Officer, Was in a ‘Shooting Stance’ The killing and subsequent angry protests have brought attention to El Cajon, a diverse, largely blue-collar city of 104,000 people that over the past two decades has absorbed a surge of refugees, many from Iraq and more recently from Syria. Some signs on Main Street—a vibrant mix of furniture stores, clothing shops and restaurants—are in Arabic. Spanish is the primary language for nearly one of every four students in the Cajon Valley Union School District, while Arabic and Chaldean—spoken by Iraqi Christians—is the main language for more than one in 10. Rob Goss, part-owner of a boxing gym on Main Street and a city resident for more than 10 years, credits Chaldeans for opening markets, gas stations and other businesses that have fueled economic growth. “We’re still in a curve of trying to get people on their own feet but it’s happening,” said Goss, 47. “They’re adapting.” The influx has bred some tension. Mayor Mark Lewis was forced to resign in 2013 for derogatory remarks about Chaldeans. “First time they come over here, it doesn’t take them too long to learn where all the freebies are at,” he said and then later apologized.

(AP Photo/Don Boomer) David Carter, a 64-year-old former construction worker who moved from Northern California four years ago to join his sister, is bothered by the subsidies that refugees receive while he struggles with cuts to government-funded health benefits that cover prescription drug, dental and other services. “I don’t resent the people but I resent what the government has allowed them,” Carter said while relaxing outside the public library. “Our ancestors had to bust their butts to get anything. That’s the American dream.” Jaffar Rahem, a 27-year-old Iraqi who works at Wal-Mart, said he came to El Cajon last year with his wife and two children because the U.S. is safer for them. He stayed for about a year in Utah and liked the people but said he moved to El Cajon to follow his father. El Cajon, which means “drawer” or “big box” in Spanish, was incorporated in 1912 and became the largest of a swath of San Diego suburbs known as East County. Located in a valley, the absence of ocean breezes brings sweltering summers but home prices are on the lower end of the San Diego market, making it a draw for many families. Annual per-capita income is $20,430, well below San Diego County’s $31,043. The city of El Cajon, Calif., a community east of San Diego, is seen on Sept. 29, 2016. (AP Photo/Don Boomer) The city, with a downtown community center named for Ronald Reagan, has long been bedrock Republican but the party’s edge over Democrats in voter registration has narrowed to 3 percentage points. There is no precise count of Iraqis in El Cajon but they have made San Diego their second-most popular metropolitan destination in the U.S. after Detroit. Whites make up a shrinking majority, while about a quarter of the city’s residents are Latino, 6 percent are black, and 4 percent are Asian. Refugees take English classes at the Main Street office of the International Rescue Committee, one of nine resettlement organizations in the country. David Murphy, the committee’s executive director in San Diego, said recently that refugees are often assigned to cities where they have family and friends or where there is an established community of immigrants who share their culture. Last month, the 10,000th Syrian to resettle across the U.S. under a year-old program arrived in El Cajon. Al Espinosa, a retired carpenter of part-Mexican descent and a resident since 1980, was heartbroken by Olango’s death and how it linked the city to other places such as Ferguson, Missouri, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, that have seen unrest after police shot and killed black men. “I thought this would never happen here,” said Espinosa, 69. “Now we’re on the world stage.” Key Facts About El Cajon, California The fatal shooting by police of Alfred Olango has brought attention to El Cajon, a diverse suburb of San Diego that has seen a surge of refugees, many from Iraq and more recently from Syria. Here’s a look at the city: POPULATION: 103,679 DEMOGRAPHICS: 57 percent white, 28 percent Hispanic, 6 percent black, 4 percent Asian.

Stocks rebound in Deutsche Bank-led volatile trading Money Saturday 1 October 2016 - 11:37am File: News that Deutsche Bank was close to a much lower settlement than expected -- $5.4 billion instead of $14 billion -- eased concerns of a Lehman-style collapse and boosted US and eurozone stocks. Photo: Wikimedia Commons NEW YORK - US and eurozone shares pushed higher Friday in volatile trade driven by Deutsche Bank's negotiations to settle US charges over its sale of toxic mortgage bonds before the financial crisis. News that Deutsche Bank was close to a much lower settlement than expected -- $5.4 billion instead of $14 billion -- with US officials on the long-standing case sparked a rally on Wall Street, with large US banks leading the broader market as worries of a Lehman-style collapse receded. The German DAX also finished solidly higher, while the euro gained on the dollar. Global stocks had been under pressure following a Bloomberg News report Thursday that a handful of hedge funds had withdrawn some money from Deutsche Bank due to worries about its capital position. READ: Deutsche Bank worries hit US stocks The US Department of Justice had targeted the German bank to pay $14 billion to settle the case concerning allegations the German bank knowingly sold toxic mortgage-backed securities between 2006 and 2008 that helped lead to the financial crisis. But on Friday, a person familiar with the matter told AFP that the German bank is near an agreement to pay a much more manageable $5.4 billion to resolve the case. "That is low enough that the bank is not likely to have significant capital needs," said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial. "$5.4 billion dollars they could live with, and so stocks came back up." The broad-based S&P 500 climbed 0.8 percent, with large US lenders Bank of America and Citigroup both climbing more than three percent. Other strong stocks in the US included retailers Costco Wholesale and Wal-Mart Stores, and the oil giants ExxonMobil and Chevron. Frankfurt reversed early losses, finishing up 1.0 percent following a stunning reversal in Deutsche Bank shares. Frankfurt-listed shares of the German bank finished up 16.1 percent at 11.71 euros after earlier falling to an historic low of 9.90 euros. The CAC in Paris advanced 0.1 percent, while the FTSE in London lost 0.3 percent. Earlier, Asian markets had fallen sharply on worries about Deutsche Bank, with Japan's Nikkei sliding 1.5 percent.

Investors hoped Deutsche Bank and the financial system in general were in better shape than they had feared. Banks made the biggest gains Friday as Germany’s largest bank tried to reassure investors about its financial health. Investors hope Deutsche Bank will be able to negotiate down the massive cost of settling a U.S. investigation into mortgage securities. Energy companies rose as the price of oil continued to move higher, and strong earnings from Costco sent consumer stocks higher. Deutsche Bank is the largest lender in Germany, and investors are concerned about not only its plunging stock price, but the potential effect on the financial system if Deutsche Bank gets into serious trouble and the German government does not help it. Those fears faded on Friday. “People came to the realization that this isn’t likely to be a big systemic risk that ripples through the financial sector,” said Nate Thooft, head of global asset allocation for Manulife Asset Management. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 164.70 points, or 0.9 percent, to 18,308.15. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rebounded 17.14 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,168.27. The Nasdaq composite rose 42.85 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,312. The Department of Justice wants Deutsche Bank to pay $14 billion to end an investigation into mortgage-backed securities, and the stock jumped Friday after a report that the bank could settle the case with a smaller payment. Deutsche Bank’s U.S.-listed stock rose $1.61, or 14 percent, to $13.09. The stock has been pummeled this year and is trading near all-time lows. Financial stocks tumbled Thursday afternoon following reports that some hedge funds were moving their business out of Deutsche Bank. On Friday, bank stocks and the broader market regained almost all of those losses. Thooft said he does not think banks are in great danger, but he said there are causes for concern, including the health of Italy’s banks. Meanwhile, with interest rates so low and regulation getting tighter, there are plenty of reasons for investors to avoid bank stocks. That didn’t stop the financial sector, the weakest sector in the market this year, from rallying on Friday. Among U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase added 94 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $66.59 and Citigroup gained $1.43, or 3.1 percent, to $47.23. Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 41 cents to $48.24 a barrel in New York, and it rose 8 percent over the last three days. Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 18 cents to $49.06 a barrel in London. Oil prices surged this week after the nations of OPEC, which collectively produce more than one-third of the world’s oil, surprised investors with an agreement on a small cut in production. Investors hope energy companies will book larger profits as a result. Chevron jumped $1.65, or 1.6 percent, to $102.92 and EOG Resources rose $1.66, or 1.7 percent, to $96.71. Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale jumped $5.02, or 3.4 percent, to $152.51 after it reported a profit that was larger than analysts expected.

Cognizant Technology Solutions tumbled after the information technology consulting and outsourcing firm said it’s investigating possible bribes paid to officials in India. Cognizant said it’s looking into potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and has informed the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant also said its president Gordon Coburn resigned. The stock fell $7.37, or 13.4 percent, to $47.63. Major stock indexes set records this quarter thanks mostly to tech stocks.

The Cheat Sheet: Black Friday Toy Predictions Discounts to Expect LEGO sets for 50% off Roundups of select toys taking up to 50% off The holiday season's hottest toys at up to 60% off Star Wars and Frozen items for up to 60% off 6 Quick Tips You Need to Know The week of Black Friday is the best time to shop Toys "R" Us' Fabulous 15 sell out quickly, so jump on any deals you see Amazon will offer more toy deals than any other merchant Look for a limited edition LEGO set during the site's "Brick" Friday Sale Tabletop games are discounted during Cyber Week Toy deals get better and more plentiful in the weeks leading up to Christmas Want more details on how, what, where, and when to buy toy deals this Black Friday? Then check out our full analysis below. Test your knowledge Are you a smart shopper? Take our quiz. Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/18 When to Shop Deals Surge on Black Friday, Return Cyber Monday Toy hunters have a lot to look forward to this Black Friday season, with the week of Black Friday itself being the best chance for deals. Get ready for toy offers to start strong at the beginning of that week and grow in volume until Black Friday — which we anticipate to be the single best day for toy savings. We'll see a sharp resurgence of interesting toy bargains again on Cyber Monday. Don't expect too much excitement from the rest of Cyber Week though, as deals tend to wind down as merchants gear up for their holiday sales. It's best to pause your toy hunting and pick it up two weeks before Christmas when things take off again. What to Buy Hottest Toys of the Season Will Be Hard to Buy Deals on the most desirable toys — like the Fabulous 15 from Toys "R" Us, or last year's popular remote-controlled BB-8 and Viewmaster VR — will continue to be sparse during the Black Friday season. That's not to say there won't be deals on the hottest toys of the holiday season; there will just be so few of them, and they'll sell out so quickly, that they'll be hard to come by. To add insult to injury, when there are deals on the season's hottest toys during the Black Friday season, they're pretty impressive: up to 60% off, in some cases. Last year that included Star Wars toys, Frozen dolls, and a random assortment of items from the Fabulous 15 list. But again, they come and go so fast it's hard to ensure that you snag one. If you want to take your chances, and think you can move quickly, the best time to find deals on the hottest toys is in the week leading up to Black Friday (though we wouldn't rule out Black Friday itself or Cyber Monday). Historically, there have been one or two deals on those must-have toys on those days — and we literally mean "one or two deals." Good luck! There's a Very Specific Time to Buy LEGOs For the past several years,  LEGO has offered the same "Brick" Friday discount: Up to 50% off a wide selection of sets, plus free shipping on all orders, plus a free limited edition holiday-themed set with orders of $99 or more — and we expect them to repeat this offer this year. This sale doesn't offer just one or two sets at half-off so they can claim "up to 50% off," either; LEGO reduces a ton of sets by 50%. This will truly be the best time to hunt for LEGO deals, not only during the Black Friday season, but all year. Even the "bad" deals are still 20% off. LEGO's "Brick Friday" sale will slash 50% off many different sets, making it the best time of the year to buy LEGOs. There will be other LEGO deals scattered throughout the season, but they'll mostly be on individual sets. Our recommendation is to wait on buying any LEGOs until you see what the Brick Friday sale has to offer. If that doesn't appease you, there will be a resurgence in LEGO deals starting on Cyber Monday and continuing into that following week, when we typically see the highest volume of individual LEGO deals. Black Friday Finally Embraces Tabletop Gamers Tabletop games, with all their bits and pieces, can be downright expensive! Luckily, our data indicates that Amazon will be the place to help you save some coin. Stay alert during Cyber Week (12/1 to 12/4), and expect the most bargains on popular titles like Ticket to Ride, Tokaido, Dominion, Pandemic, Munchkin, Betrayal at House on the Hill, and more. Where to Shop If You Only Shop at One Store... Over the course of the entire Black Friday season,  Amazon will be the store to beat. Last year, it turned in 16% more toy deals than the next highest contender,  Target, and we expect the same first-place performance this year. It should be pointed out that even though Target may come in second overall, it actually offered more deals during Black Friday week. Amazon will be the store to beat for toy deals. Last year, the site had 16% more toy deals than the runner up, Target. Last year, third place went to  Walmart, which offered a third fewer deals than Target during the Black Friday season (and about 40% fewer deals than Amazon). We don't expect any greater performance from them this year, as Amazon has tended to match or beat every Walmart toy deal for the past several years. Finally (and sadly), Toys "R" Us — a company with "toys" right in its name — wound up at the back of the pack last year, offering up a quarter as many deals as Amazon. Remember: Even though Black Friday is a great time to buy toys, deals always tend to get better and more frequent in the two weeks before Christmas. With the exception of the LEGO "Brick" Friday sale, Black Friday isn't your single best (or last) chance to get a deal on most toys! What are you hoping to see among the toy deals this year?

By: AP | El Cajon | Published:October 1, 2016 2:05 pm Main Street in the city of El Cajon, Calif., a community east of San Diego, is seen Thursday Sept. 29, 2016. On Tuesday, Sept. 27, 2016, an El Cajon police officer shot and killed Alfred Olango, a Ugandan refugee who lived in the city. (AP Photo) The family of an unarmed black man fatally shot by police is like thousands who have transformed the suburban San Diego city of El Cajon: Refugees from a strife-torn country. The family of 38-year-old Alfred Olango fled Uganda to a refugee camp and then came to the United States in 1991. On Tuesday, Olango, a father of two girls, was killed by an officer who responded to calls from Olango’s sister saying her brother was acting erratically and wandering into traffic. He was shot multiple times after police say he pulled something from his pocket that they thought could be a weapon and pointed it at the officer. The object turned out to be a 4-inch electronic cigarette device. The killing and subsequent angry protests have brought attention to El Cajon, a diverse, largely blue-collar city of 104,000 people that over the past two decades has absorbed a surge of refugees, many from Iraq and more recently from Syria.

Spanish is the primary language for nearly one of every four students in the Cajon Valley Union School District, while Arabic and Chaldean — spoken by Iraqi Christians — is the main language for more than one in 10. Rob Goss, part-owner of a boxing gym on Main Street and a city resident for more than 10 years, credits Chaldeans for opening markets, gas stations and other businesses that have fueled economic growth. “We’re still in a curve of trying to get people on their own feet but it’s happening,” said Goss, 47. “They’re adapting.” The influx has bred some tension. Mayor Mark Lewis was forced to resign in 2013 for derogatory remarks about Chaldeans. “First time they come over here, it doesn’t take them too long to learn where all the freebies are at,” he said and then later apologized. David Carter, a 64-year-old former construction worker who moved from Northern California four years ago to join his sister, is bothered by the subsidies that refugees receive while he struggles with cuts to government-funded health benefits that cover prescription drug, dental and other services. “I don’t resent the people but I resent what the government has allowed them,” Carter said while relaxing outside the public library. “Our ancestors had to bust their butts to get anything. That’s the American dream.” Jaffar Rahem, a 27-year-old Iraqi who works at Wal-Mart, said he came to El Cajon last year with his wife and two children because the U.S. is safer for them. He stayed for about a year in Utah and liked the people but said he moved to El Cajon to follow his father. El Cajon, which means “drawer” or “big box” in Spanish, was incorporated in 1912 and became the largest of a swath of San Diego suburbs known as East County. Located in a valley, the absence of ocean breezes brings sweltering summers but home prices are on the lower end of the San Diego market, making it a draw for many families. Annual per-capita income is $20,430, well below San Diego County’s $31,043. The city, with a downtown community center named for Ronald Reagan, has long been bedrock Republican but the party’s edge over Democrats in voter registration has narrowed to 3 percentage points. There is no precise count of Iraqis in El Cajon but they have made San Diego their second-most popular metropolitan destination in the U.S. after Detroit. Whites make up a shrinking majority, while about a quarter of the city’s residents are Latino, 6 percent are black, and 4 percent are Asian. Refugees take English classes at the Main Street office of the International Rescue Committee, one of nine resettlement organizations in the country. David Murphy, the committee’s executive director in San Diego, said recently that refugees are often assigned to cities where they have family and friends or where there is an established community of immigrants who share their culture. Last month, the 10,000th Syrian to resettle across the U.S. under a year-old program arrived in El Cajon. Al Espinosa, a retired carpenter of part-Mexican descent and a resident since 1980, was heartbroken by Olango’s death and how it linked the city to other places such as Ferguson, Missouri, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, that have seen unrest after police shot and killed black men. “I thought this would never happen here,” said Espinosa, 69. “Now we’re on the world stage.” Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaDemonetisation: Misuse of bank account for black money deposit to invite govt action IndiaLong queues outside banks a ‘serious issue’, says SC on demonetisation BusinessUse indelible ink in banks keeping in mind upcoming bypolls: EC writes to Finance Ministry IndiaNavy rubbishes Pak Navy claim that it stopped Indian submarine from entering waters BusinessDemonetisation live updates: This is a required surgery done for a better India, says Venkaiah Naidu EntertainmentForce 2 movie review: John Abraham, Sonakshi Sinha film is Bond-Bourne rehash EntertainmentChris Martin parties with Shah Rukh Khan, Sussanne Khan and Sridevi's daughters, see inside pics EntertainmentIt's November 18, Salman Khan's wedding day, see pics EntertainmentIulia Vantur reveals what she had to sacrifice to live in India.

Log In 1 of 3 Premium Clicks used this month Print + Online Subscriber Activation Register Subscribe News Sports Revels Life Obituaries Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds log in Site Archive Herb Rothschild Jr.: Measure 97, Part 3 Saturday Oct 1, 2016 at 12:01 AM This is the last of three columns on Measure 97, which proposes to raise funds for education, health care and senior services by increasing the minimum tax on a corporation’s annual sales of $25 million or more in Oregon. In it I consider whether consumers, not the affected corporations, would foot the bill. The “No on 97” mailer I received claims the “$6 billion tax on sales [will be] passed on to consumers.” If true, it’s the opponents’ most persuasive argument. Before I examine it, I’ll agree that taxing a corporation’s sales rather than its profits isn’t the best approach. But as I explained last week, corporations have used their legislative clout to evade Oregon’s taxes on business income. About 70 percent of them, including many of the largest, pay the alternative minimum tax, which is based on their Oregon sales. Only now that their sales tax might not stay laughably low are they arguing that it’s wrong to tax their sales. We can’t know for sure who’ll pay what. The corporations could to absorb the entire cost or they could pass it all on to consumers. We do know that comparisons of retail prices across the U.S. reveal no correlation between prices and corporate taxes, which vary greatly. If there were, Oregon consumers would pay the lowest prices in the nation, because large corporations here pay the lowest taxes in the nation. Our benefit at the cash register is that we pay no sales tax, not that these corporations give us a break in return for the break we’ve been giving them. The "no" forces claim that because there are no exemptions for food and other necessities, low-income families will be hurt the most. But it’s unlikely that the cost of necessities will be much affected. A 2016 comparative price study by the Oregon Consumers League concluded that the prices for common staples, such as cereal, diapers, duct tape and Legos, are remarkably consistent across the country. Further, the large retailers it studied — Kroger, Target, Lowe’s, Walmart and Toys “R” Us — have uniform prices nationally. More comprehensively, the study found that the Council for Community and Economic Research’s Cost of Living Index, a tool for comparing the costs of goods and services in the U.S., doesn’t vary in relation to state corporate taxes. I want to mention car prices, since Lithia Motors is locally headquartered, sells lots of cars in Oregon, and its CEO has issued dire warnings about Measure 97. It’s hard to compare car prices, because dealer competition varies from locale to locale and time to time, and because each buyer negotiates with the dealership. But the Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price is a constant. In 2010 Autoblog listed the 10 cities with the largest average discounts from the MSRP. They ranged from Tampa/Orlando (10 percent) down to San Francisco (8.1 percent) across nine states. No Oregon city was listed. By now that list will have changed, but that’s beside my point — car prices also don’t seem to vary with the state taxes corporations pay. I’ll end with this from Rep. Peter Buckley: “The Tax Foundation (a conservative organization) study shows that overall, consumer prices might increase 0.9 percent over time. Even if that should prove true, the increased benefits of well-funded schools, health/mental health care, senior services, etc. should boost our economy and our quality of life far beyond that.” — Herb Rothschild's column appears in the Tidings every Saturday.   About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Reader Services Reader Services Subscriptions Subscriber controls Contact us Submissions Photos Events Letters to the editor Corrections Alerts Email alerts RSS feeds Text Alerts Advertise Media Kit Home Products and services Ad rates Advertising contacts Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2016 GateHouse Media, LLC.

Login Learn more about Thomson Reuters Foundation Home Women's Rights Climate Trafficking Property Rights Humanitarian Food Search "Press 1 for child labour": Garment workers use cellphones to report abuses by Rina Chandran | @rinachandran | Thomson Reuters Foundation Friday, 30 September 2016 11:33 GMT Workers speak to each other while working in a garment factory in Dharavi, one of Asia's largest slums, in Mumbai March 12, 2015. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui About our Trafficking coverage We shine a light on human trafficking, forced labour and modern-day slavery Share: Newsletter sign up: Most Popular Toxic pollutants choke Iraqi children caught in Islamic State retreat With fragile ceasefire, Colombia peace deal must be implemented fast, UN says Escaped Chibok girls overcome doubts and jealousy to attend university 'The old me is gone': Rise in transgender children in UK fuels identity fears Myanmar refugee doctor wins humanitarian prize for clinic in Thailand The idea is to give big brands early warning of problems at the furthest ends of their supply chains By Rina Chandran MUMBAI, Sept 30 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Textile workers from Bangladesh to Turkey are using cellphones to report child labour, delayed wages and trafficking - a trend rights groups say shows the promise of technology in tackling abuses in the garment industry. Two mobile services, both by U.S.-based companies, encourage workers to call toll-free numbers to anonymously log violations they see around them. The idea is to give big brands early warning of problems at the furthest ends of their supply chains as they seek to comply with tougher legislation against labour exploitation and modern slavery. "One of the big challenges for companies in locations far from their suppliers is: How do you hear from workers directly?" said Sarah Labowitz, co-director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at the NYC Stern School of Business in New York. "When it comes to issues such as discrimination, harassment and abuse, workers have a role in flagging these problems. And as with a lot of social problems, we often look to technology for solutions," she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The two systems, Laborlink and LaborVoices, are similar. Workers call and answer simple questions, pressing 1 for "yes" and 2 for "no". Questions are along the lines of: Are you being treated fairly? Are wages paid on time? Are fire exits locked? Have you seen a child worker? An analysis of calls to LaborVoices from more than 5,000 workers in Bangladesh in the first half of the year showed almost a fifth of factories had a "high risk" of child labour, Ayush Khanna, a LaborVoices director, said. "Mobile-phone penetration in developing countries is more than 90 percent today, so it's an obvious technology to use to increase the transparency and accountability of the supply chain," he said in a phone interview. "The system gets around many of the limitations of traditional audits, which are slow, occasional and may be inaccurate because workers are afraid." Bangladesh, which ranks only behind China as a supplier of apparel to Western countries, relies on garments for more than 80 percent of its exports and about 4 million jobs. Workers earn a minimum monthly wage of $68, compared with $280 in China. Low wages and poor working conditions have plagued the country's $26 billion garment export industry. Bangladesh had one of the worst industrial accidents in 2013, when more than 1,000 people were killed in the collapse of the Rana Plaza complex. In May this year, three workers were killed in a fire at a textile factory near Dhaka. Since the Rana Plaza disaster, legislation has been introduced for greater supply-chain transparency and improved rights and safety for workers. But progress has been slow. The 5,239 workers who called LaborVoices in the first half of the year worked in 85 factories in Dhaka and Chittagong, which supplied more than 30 global brands including Walmart, Target, Zara, Adidas, H&M and Levi's, Khanna said. LaborVoices is also tracking abuse of Syrian migrant workers in Turkey's garment industry, seeking evidence of forced labour and trafficking, Khanna said. Laborlink has reached more than 500,000 workers in 16 countries from China to Colombia, the company says. But while technology can help flag abuses in the supply chain, it cannot single-handedly solve them, Labowitz said. "Calls from workers is a good system to have, but it is not a substitute for audits and checks," she said. "You need both to tackle the issues in the supply chain."

The video, filmed in San Francisco, California, shows London and Miles, both two years old, screaming and shouting in comical fashion, as the debate concludes on television in the background. According to the filmer, the childrens' mother, the debate started with a hug, "but things got out of hand pretty quickly." "Last week - we were on a Post-church Sunday shopping spree to Walmart," she later wrote online. "We saw the matching Hillary/Trump Halloween masks for the two-year-old twins [for] $9.95 each." She then commented on the debate itself, saying: "Things got out of hand pretty quickly. "No matter if you are Pro-Clinton/Anti-Trump, a Bernout, or a full-fledged Trumpkin this amazing ending to #DebateNight with these toddler twins is everything." ++CLIENTS PLEASE NOTE: THIS VIDEO HAS BEEN LOOPED++ Recent related news Japanese factory sees crazy demand for Trump masksIn the wake of the presidential election, factories are struggling to keep up with the demand for...

Investors hoped Deutsche Bank and the financial system in general were in better shape than they had feared. Banks made the biggest gains Friday as Germany’s largest bank tried to reassure investors about its financial health. Investors hope Deutsche Bank will be able to negotiate down the massive cost of settling a U.S. investigation into mortgage securities. Energy companies rose as the price of oil continued to move higher, and strong earnings from Costco sent consumer stocks higher. Deutsche Bank is the largest lender in Germany, and investors are concerned about not only its plunging stock price, but the potential effect on the financial system if Deutsche Bank gets into serious trouble and the German government does not help it. Those fears faded on Friday. “People came to the realization that this isn’t likely to be a big systemic risk that ripples through the financial sector,” said Nate Thooft, head of global asset allocation for Manulife Asset Management. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 164.70 points, or 0.9 percent, to 18,308.15. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rebounded 17.14 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,168.27. The Nasdaq composite rose 42.85 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,312. The Department of Justice wants Deutsche Bank to pay $14 billion to end an investigation into mortgage-backed securities, and the stock jumped Friday after a report that the bank could settle the case with a smaller payment. Deutsche Bank’s U.S.-listed stock rose $1.61, or 14 percent, to $13.09. The stock has been pummeled this year and is trading near all-time lows. Financial stocks tumbled Thursday afternoon following reports that some hedge funds were moving their business out of Deutsche Bank. On Friday, bank stocks and the broader market regained almost all of those losses. Thooft said he does not think banks are in great danger, but he said there are causes for concern, including the health of Italy’s banks. Meanwhile, with interest rates so low and regulation getting tighter, there are plenty of reasons for investors to avoid bank stocks. That didn’t stop the financial sector, the weakest sector in the market this year, from rallying on Friday. Among U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase added 94 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $66.59 and Citigroup gained $1.43, or 3.1 percent, to $47.23. Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 41 cents to $48.24 a barrel in New York, and it rose 8 percent over the last three days. Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 18 cents to $49.06 a barrel in London. Oil prices surged this week after the nations of OPEC, which collectively produce more than one-third of the world’s oil, surprised investors with an agreement on a small cut in production. Investors hope energy companies will book larger profits as a result. Chevron jumped $1.65, or 1.6 percent, to $102.92 and EOG Resources rose $1.66, or 1.7 percent, to $96.71. Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale jumped $5.02, or 3.4 percent, to $152.51 after it reported a profit larger than analysts expected. Companies that make and sell household necessities also climbed. Procter & Gamble gained $1.52, or 1.7 percent, to $89.75 and Wal-Mart rose $1.39, or 2 percent, to $72.12. Cognizant Technology Solutions tumbled after the information technology consulting and outsourcing firm said it’s investigating possible bribes paid to officials in India. Cognizant said it’s looking into potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and has informed the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant also said its president Gordon Coburn resigned. The stock fell $7.37, or 13.4 percent, to $47.63. Major stock indexes set records this quarter thanks mostly to tech stocks. The S&P 500 technology index climbed 12 percent over the last three months. Apple, the most valuable company in the S&P 500, surged 18 percent, partly on indications of strong sales for the newest iPhones. Microsoft, the next-largest company, rose 13 percent and another tech giant, Google parent Alphabet, leaped 14 percent. Bond prices sank. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.60 percent from 1.56 percent. Stocks that pay high dividends, like utilities and real estate and phone companies, traded lower. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline picked up 2 cents to $1.49 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2 cents to $1.53 a gallon. Natural gas slipped 5 cents to $2.91 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $8.90 to $1,317.10 an ounce. Silver rose 3 cents to $19.21 an ounce. Copper gained 2 cents to $2.21 a pound. The dollar rose to 101.41 yen from 101.07 yen. The euro rose to $1.1237 from $1.1216. Germany’s DAX climbed 1 percent and France’s CAC 40 added 0.1 percent. The FTSE 100 in Britain lost 0.3 percent. Major indexes in Asia slumped on concerns about the banking industry. Japan’s Nikkei 225 slumped 1.5 percent and South Korea’s Kospi fell 1.2 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index sank 1.9 percent.

Saritha Rai @SarithaRai More stories by Saritha Rai October 2, 2016 — 5:00 PM EDT October 2, 2016 — 5:00 PM EDT Amazon to Spend $5 Billion to Dominate India E-Commerce When Jeff Bezos donned a bandhgala jacket two years ago and posed for photographs in India, he wasn't just promoting Amazon.com Inc.'s year-old business in the country. The web retailer's chief executive officer was also putting his reputation on the line to break into the emerging e-commerce market. Jeff Bezos visits Bangalore in September 2014. Photographer: Manjunath Kiran/AFP via Getty Images Now, with 80 million products for sale, 120,000-plus merchants and more than two dozen warehouses, Bezos's protégé Amit Agarwal is aiming to make Amazon the country's top online store by sales ahead of the Diwali shopping season. Known as the "festival of lights," the run-up to the celebration is India's biggest retail event, when consumers buy everything from clothes and electronics to jewelry and cars. Indians will spend as much as $1.7 billion online during Diwali this year, according to RedSeer Consulting. Flipkart Ltd., India's top web retailer, and local rival Snapdeal, are well aware that they're facing a critical test this year amid Amazon's onslaught. All three are flooding newspapers, billboards and TV shows with ads and are offering discounts for Diwali, which now makes up a third of annual e-commerce sales. At stake is the future of India's online shopping market, as well as Amazon's global expansion plans, which had faltered after it failed to conquer China. "This season could decide who'll be the ultimate winner," said Haresh Chawla, a Mumbai-based partner at private equity firm India Value Fund Advisors and an angel investor. "The loser will get unnerved and the victor can build internal confidence and rally the troops for the bigger game." Reaching consumers in India has never been easy—just ask Unilever NV or Procter & Gamble Co., which spent decades making inroads into the market. There are 22 official languages, and consumption habits differ from place to place. On top of that, there are supply chain inefficiencies, high real estate costs, lack of skilled workers, along with poor infrastructure and labyrinthine regulations.  Even so, the prospect of becoming the main web store in a country of 1.25 billion people who are just learning how to shop online is tantalizing. RedSeer Consultancy Pvt. estimates that annual online sales will be $80 billion to $100 billion by 2020 from the current estimate of about $13 billion. "Barely 2 percent of the population shops online," said Mrigank Gutgutia, who covers consumer internet trends at the Bangalore-based researcher. "It is still only the tip of the India e-commerce iceberg." Merrill Lynch estimates that Amazon may sell as much as $81 billion in merchandise by 2025, up from $3.7 billion last year. Becoming India's top web retailer would be a vindication for Amazon. In China, the only other market with more than a billion people, the company has little to show after a dozen years, thanks to the dominance of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and other local web retailers. "The biggest opportunity and the biggest challenges are both in India," said Agarwal, chief of Amazon India. "It's going to be a great Diwali." Amit Agarwal.  Photographer: Namas Bhojani/Bloomberg After graduating from Stanford University, the 42-year-old spent part of his career at Amazon's Seattle headquarters as Bezos's technical shadow, a coveted position at the company that grooms future leaders by giving them a front-row view of how the business is run. To expand inventory, Amazon has been recruiting sellers at breakneck speed. The web retailer has deployed an army of white-and-orange Chai Carts with emissaries who teach sellers how to list inventory and handle returns over cups of milky chai tea. Another service, called Feet-on-Street, sends people on motorbikes to help merchants photograph and market their wares. Another big task will be moving beyond India's eight big urban areas and into smaller towns and cities. "There could be a protest on the streets, potholes on the road, labor challenges, warehouses in different regions with varied rules, goods trucks passing through state checkpoints—and after all this, the package still has to arrive at the customers’ doorstep overnight if not within hours," Agarwal said. One key goal for Amazon—its tagline for Diwali is tyohar bade dilwala (the festival with a big heart)—is to lure dormant shoppers and first-time buyers. There are important trends working in Amazon's favor. Exploding smartphone use offers the promise of bringing online commerce to hundreds of millions of buyers and sellers. An Amazon pick up point in New Delhi. Photographer: Mint/Hindustan Times via Getty Images All of these efforts in India cost money; in June, Amazon said it will invest an additional $3 billion in India on top of an already allocated $2 billion. "An open funding tap could help Amazon offer discounts and bleed out some of its rivals," said RedSeer's Gutgutia. For Flipkart and Snapdeal, the upcoming Diwali season will determine their ability to stay in the game. For smaller e-commerce startups, survival is at stake. Many, like AskmeBazaar—which advertised aggressively during Diwali last year—shut down before they could make it to this one.

Amazon's top rival in India is in advanced discussions with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to sell a minority stake to the U.S. retailer for as much as $1 billion. The Indian web retailer is adding 10,000 temp workers to handle last-mile logistics, and is offering financing plans to put expensive purchases within customers' reach. Flipkart's tagline this year is ab itne me itnaaa milega: now you'll get so much for so little. Delhi-based Snapdeal, whose backers include Alibaba and Softbank Group Corp., re-branded itself ahead of the shopping season, with a red box logo (its pitch: unbox zindagi, or unbox life).  Consumers like Nivedita Raju, are already noticing the difference. The Bangalore-based government official, who buys DVDs, herbs and knickknacks online, said that when she was looking for a computer title that was out-of-stock on Amazon, the web retailer had it printed and dispatched within 10 days. "It’s a very different level of customer service than Indians have been used to," she said. A shopper carries boxes of toys on his head in Mumbai two days before Diwali.

(That’s probably not an exaggeration, either.) My skin is so sensitive that sometimes, in the middle of the day, as I sit stationary at my desk, it develops a rash, or a hive, or a burning itching patch, completely unprovoked. And when it’s not staging a coup on my sanity, it’s flaking. Oh, how it flakes. I have a strict, five-second window between washing my face and applying moisturizer before my skin tightens and shrivels into a dull, angry mess. MORE: 5 Things You Need to Know Before Taking Hair and Nail Vitamins “But use a moisturizer!” you say, and I laugh. My normal nighttime routine currently consists of a hydrating serum, a thick-as-hell cream, an occlusive moisturizer (occlusive formulas basically form a film on the skin to prevent water loss), and then, sometimes, a facial oil on top, just for funsies. And still, I frequently wake up with a dry face. (It’s actually miraculous; I might be an anomaly. Somebody call Guinness.) Hope is not lost, though. Because throughout my many years of talking to derms, testing moisturizers, and combing the interwebs for advice, I have found hope and relief, mainly in the form of five very excellent, very magical moisturizers. Moisturizers that are specifically formulated to hydrate, soothe, and restore happiness to bedraggled skin, all with clogging pores.

November 18, 2016 0241 GMT Home Iran Africa Asia Europe International U.S. Middle East Culture Business Health Sport Society Video News ID:169700 Publish Date: Sun, 02 Oct 2016 22:30:15 GMT Service: Iran Clinton raises over $150 million in September, to hit $1 billion US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton raised $154 million in September, the campaign’s biggest fundraising haul so far in the race for the White House. Of the total figure, $84 million was directly raised by Clinton’s campaign committee, up from the $62 million in August, the former secretary of state’s campaign said Saturday. An additional $70 million was raised by the Hillary Victory Fund, which finances the campaign, the Democratic National Committee and various state parties. Over 900,000 people donated to “Hillary for America” in September, the statement read, adding that the average donation for the month stood at around $56. Despite the high numbers, Clinton’s campaign manager called for more contributions to fight Donald Trump, the Republican nominee. “With Donald Trump promising to dump an additional $50 million of his own money into the campaign and right-wing billionaires pledging millions more, we must continue to step up in order to have the resources we need to mobilize millions of voters across the country,” Clinton’s campaign manager Robby Mook said. The call for more donations surprised some experts as Clinton’s campaign has already raised more than $989 million since she entered the race in early 2015. The figure puts her well ahead of Trump, who earned $90 million for his campaign in August and has invested $60 million in his own campaign. Compared with the 2012 cycle, Clinton’s earnings dwarfed those of President Barack Obama, who had raised $110 in September that year. The 2012 vote was the most expensive presidential race on record, as both Obama and his Republican rival Mitt Romney raised well over $1 billion. Clinton is enjoying financial support from a growing list of American billionaires who oppose Trump. So far, movie producers Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg, financiers Warren Buffett and George Soros, and Walmart heiress Alice Walton have all made contributions to the former first lady’s campaign. This is while some of the Republican-leaning billionaires have announced that that they will not support Trump as the party nominee.     KeyWords Clinton September US   Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News Tremor shakes western Iran Norway’s DNO to study key Iranian oil field Saudi-proposed anti-Syria resolution rewarding terror sponsors: Iran Iran rejects 'baseless' claims by Arab states Iran warns against Israel’s bid to erase al-Quds Islamic identity Senior Iranian official warns US against failing to comply with nuclear deal Germany will try to ensure Iran nuclear deal survives with Trump Iran pours cold water on Hong Kong Rouhani: Government, system seeking constructive interaction with world Leader: Iran unimpressed by US election results Most Visited Obama vows to veto bill seeking to block Iran plane sales US House renews sanctions on Iran, sets sanctions on Syria Trump not going to ‘hurt’ Clinton www.irandailyonline.com All rights reserved by iran Daily Online Copyright Page Generated in 0/2725 sec

Donald Trump's battle with the truth continued Saturday.  (Evan Vucci / The Associated Press)   By Daniel DaleWashington Bureau Sun., Oct. 2, 2016 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump gave a speech in Pennsylvania on Saturday, Oct. 1. He also issued a statement in response to a bombshell New York Times story about his taxes. He said 12 false things: 1. Falsely said, “We have the support of the Hispanics and the African-Americans.” (Trump is losing by massive margins with Hispanics and African-Americans.) 2. Falsely said the New York Times “illegally obtained” his tax information. (A reporter simply opened her mail; the documents were sent to her.) 3. Falsely said, “They say she’s worth $200, $250 million.” (Reports the Washington Post: “In the Clintons’ 2015 personal financial disclosure form, they reported valued assets ranging from $11.3 million to $52.7 million. This number does not reflect homes that the Clintons own. In 2015, Forbes estimated their combined net worth at $45 million.”) 4. Falsely said, “She also wants to shut down production of shale energy.” (Clinton has called for strict new restrictions, but not a shutdown. “With strong safeguards in place, natural gas can play an important role in our transition to a clean energy economy,” she has said.) Article Continued Below 5. Falsely said, “We don’t make anything anymore.” (Manufacturing represented 12 per cent of the American economy in 2015.) 6. Falsely said the U.S. has China “trade deficits of $400, $500 billion a year.” (The deficit was about $330 billion last year including services, $367 billion with goods alone. It may be lower this year.) 7. Falsely said: “It’s not like, ‘Oh gee do you think she’s guilty?’ They’ve actually admitted she’s guilty.” (No authority has “admitted” that Clinton is guilty of crimes related to her emails.) 8. Falsely said of Bill Clinton, “He can’t practise law. He can’t be a lawyer. He was a lawyer. He can’t be a lawyer.” (Clinton was not disbarred over his sex scandals. His Arkansas law license was suspended for five years. While he can’t currently work as a lawyer, he could do so within a week or so if he wanted to: Applications for reinstatement are “routinely approved,” a senior official of the Arkansas legal body said in 2006, when he became eligible for reinstatement.) 9. Falsely said, “Like the European Union, she wants to erase our borders.” (Clinton is not proposing to erase borders or create anything like the European Union.) 10. Falsely said of Clinton’s refugee policy: “She wants people to pour into our country without knowing who they are.” (Clinton is not proposing a loosening of the strict screening process for refugees.) 11. Falsely said, “Here’s a person who’s only worked for government, essentially.” (Clinton’s private-sector career was cut short by Bill’s political career, but she worked non-government jobs for several years as a young woman: Lawyer at the Children’s Defense Fund and later Rose Law Firm, and instructor at the University of Arkansas law school. She also served on corporate boards, including Walmart’s.) 12. Falsely said, “Favours and access were granted to those who wrote checks. She put the secretary of state up for sale.” (There is no evidence Clinton sold favours or tried to.) 13. Misleadingly claimed endorsements from “the Border Patrol, ICE.” (Unions representing officers of these agencies have endorsed him, not the agencies themselves.)

News that Deutsche Bank was close to a much lower settlement than expected—$5.4 billion instead of $14 billion—with US officials on the long-standing case sparked a rally on Wall Street, with large US banks leading the broader market as worries of a Lehman-style collapse receded. The German DAX also finished solidly higher, while the euro gained on the dollar. Global stocks had been under pressure following a Bloomberg News report Thursday that a handful of hedge funds had withdrawn some money from Deutsche Bank due to worries about its capital position. The US Department of Justice had targeted the German bank to pay $14 billion to settle the case concerning allegations the German bank knowingly sold toxic mortgage-backed securities between 2006 and 2008 that helped lead to the financial crisis. But on Friday, a person familiar with the matter told AFP that the German bank is near an agreement to pay a much more manageable $5.4 billion to resolve the case. “That is low enough that the bank is not likely to have significant capital needs,” said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial. “$5.4 billion dollars they could live with, and so stocks came back up.” The broad-based S&P 500 climbed 0.8 percent, with large US lenders Bank of America and Citigroup both climbing more than three percent.

Powell also owns Jimmy’s North Star at 1732 George St., which is known for gyro sandwiches. He had operated the Jimmy’s Gyro Hut drive-thru from 2009 to 2010, and again from November 2015 until July 1. He said when he reopened the gyro drive-thru last November, he figured (correctly) that it would boost traffic to Jimmy’s North Star, and planned to switch to a new drive-thru concept within six to 12 months. “Freshness and quality are our focus” at Oscar’s Full Belly Deli, Powell said. It offers five specialty sandwiches, such as The Oscar – which is made with ham, roast beef, bacon, salami, provolone cheese, lettuce, onion and tomato. The deli sandwiches are made with bolillo rolls that are baked fresh daily. “We also have all kinds of build-your-own options,” as well as fresh soup and a kids’ menu, said Powell, who named the deli after his dog, Oscar. The drive-thru (customers also can walk up) will be open year-round. Hours are 10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday. For more information, the drive-thru plans to soon have a Facebook page. Noelke Music opened its studio in August at 123 W. Hamilton St. in downtown West Salem. “I have been teaching (music) for many years, but made it a business in 2013 out of my home after I stopped teaching full time in schools where I was a middle school band director,” owner Laurie Noelke said. “I expanded it to a studio since there were requests for different kinds of lessons that I did not offer.” Noelke and other instructors offer private lessons at the studio in piano, flute, voice, guitar, brass instruments and drum set. “We also offer children’s music classes and adult learning opportunities,” Noelke said. “Our first children’s class, called ‘Music and Movement,’ will be Oct. 13 at 6 p.m. and is for 3- to 5-year-olds.” For more information, call (608)-612-0022 or visit www.noelkemusic.com or the studio’s Facebook page. Journey Active fitness studio will open in late fall at 1245 Badger St., on the second floor of the new Aguilera building in La Crosse. Kevin and Devan Weis own the new business. He received a business management degree from the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, with an emphasis in sustainability and minor in economics and is a financial advisor in La Crosse. Devan has a degree in kinesiology-movement studies and nutrition and has five years of experience teaching classes and working with individuals in the fitness industry. The new fitness studio will focus on group classes when it opens, Devan said, adding that there also will be open gym hours. “We will also be phasing in small group training, personal training and online training,” she said. “We want to focus more on overall wellness rather than just fitness – so we will be having monthly seminars/educational sessions for all community members to attend and learn more about all aspects of wellness.” For more information, visit www.journeyactive.com or the studio’s Facebook page. An Arby’s restaurant is being built in front of the Walmart supercenter on Hwy. 54 in Black River Falls. The restaurant is expected to open in late November and will have about 50 employees, said Abbey Ramsey, director of marketing for Arby’s franchisee DRM Inc., based in Omaha, Neb. “It’s a great location and we love opening in new communities,” Ramsey said of DRM’s decision to build an Arby’s in Black River Falls. DRM operates 71 Arby’s locations in Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska and Wisconsin, and plans to add 25 more in those states over the next seven years. “Sparta and Black River Falls will be numbers 72 and 73” when both open in late November, Ramsey said.

Getting a Starbucks beverage is already incredibly convenient for people with the coffee chain's app, which lets you order, pay in advance, and pick your drinks up. According to Eater, 10% of orders at the most popular Starbucks establishments are placed through the app. Advertisement Now, it's getting even easier for customers in Snoqualmie, WA, to get their hands on a pumpkin spice latte. One of the city's stores is testing a curbside service. Customers can use the app to place their order, drive up to the store, and a barista will bring their drinks to the car. One employee of the Starbucks, however, told Eater that customers weren't really using this service. Maybe that's for logistical reasons: Commenters on the site Living Snoqualmie are worried that it'll hold up traffic. The Starbucks has a special curbside area in order to keep traffic at bay, however. Target also developed a pilot curbside program, but ended it after less than two years, according to Business Insider. Walmart still has several curbside locations, The Tampa Bay Times reported. The new Starbucks offering will last for six weeks. It remains to be seen whether it will last or expand to other locations.

Todd Campbell (TMFEBCapital) Oct 1, 2016 at 12:01PM Image source: Getty Images. If you're a retiree worrying over the high cost of healthcare, you're not alone. Healthcare costs are increasing faster than prices for other goods and services and that's taxing seniors, especially those who are relying heavily on Social Security income. In the past year, medical costs are up 4.9%, yet Social Security income is unchanged. Therefore, rising costs are pressuring retiree budgets. To relieve some of that pressure, consider these money-saving tips. They may just help you stretch your healthcare dollars further in 2017. Capitalize on a younger spouse If your spouse isn't signed up for Medicare yet and he or she is insured via a high-deductible health insurance plan, consider the benefits associated with your spouse establishing a health savings account, or HSA. Although you can't contribute to an HSA once you're on Medicare, your spouse can. In 2017, your spouse can contribute up to $7,750 to an HSA account ($6,750 plus a $1,000 catch-up contribution) and as long as that money is used for your qualified medical expenses, it will be tax free. Unused money in an HSA can be rolled forward into future years, too. That means that an HSA can reduce the risk of needing to draw down taxable retirement savings, such as traditional IRAs, for future healthcare expenses. HSAs can also allow more money to grow tax-deferred for heirs. It can prevent IRA withdrawals from spiking your income and causing your future Medicare Part B premiums to be subject to income-related premium adjustments, too. Prepare for the future Baby boomers are living longer than ever before and while that's great news, it also means that more baby boomers will require long-term care at some point during their lifetime. Unfortunately, long-term healthcare is outlandishly expensive, and in most cases it isn't covered by Medicare. A home health aide or assisted living can cost $3,800 per month and a semi-private room in a nursing home can cost $6,800 per month, according to Genworth Financial. Moreover, while Medicaid can pay for long-term care, qualifying for Medicaid means spending down virtually all of your savings and Medicaid can put a lien on your home to recoup any expenses incurred on your behalf. Instead or rolling the dice on long-term care, a better strategy could be to get a long-term care insurance policy. Long-term care insurance isn't cheap, but neither is long-term care. Since 70% of people turning 65 can expect to require at least some long-term care during their lifetime, the odds are that this insurance will pay off at some point. If you do decide to sign up for a long-term care policy, sign up when you're younger, rather than when you're older. You're more likely to get approved when you're younger and you could end up paying less for your coverage. Close Medicare's gaps Medicare Part A and Part B plans provide a vital safety-net for seniors, but they don't pay all of a retiree's healthcare expenses. Part A covers hospitalization costs, but it requires a $1,288 deductible for each hospitalization benefit period and after 60 days of hospitalization, patients are subject to co-insurance. After 90 days, co-insurance rates double until an individual's 60 reserve days are used up, and after that, patients can be on the hook for all of their hospital costs. Part B pays for basic healthcare services, such as doctor visits and lab work, but it also requires a small annual deductible and 20% patient cost-sharing. Neither Part A or Part B cap the out-of-pocket spending for recipients in a given year, either. Since no one knows when an illness or an injury may strike and Medicare has "gaps" in its coverage, it could pay-off to purchase a Medigap plan. There are 10 different types of Medigap plans and each offers slightly different coverage. The most common plan chosen by retirees is Medigap Plan F, which is the most comprehensive. The coverage that's provided to original Medicare recipients by Plan F has to be the same from insurer to insurer, but prices of these plans vary depending on which premium calculation method is used by the insurer. For example, Medigap Plan F premiums in New Hampshire range between $173 and $357 per month. That's a pretty big range, so make sure to shop around. Dig into the details Medicare allows you to change Medicare Advantage and Part D plans during open enrollment and that open enrollment period runs between Oct. 15 and Dec. 7 this year. Medicare Advantage and Part D plans are offered by private insurers and that means your insurance coverage provided and premiums can change significantly from year to year. If your plan premium is set to increase in 2017, now's a great time to take a look at your other options. When you do, pay particular attention to whether or not any changes have been made to how your insurer will cover the cost of your medications. How much you pay for prescriptions depends on where medicines are placed within insurer's drug tiers. New drug approvals and negotiated discounts can lead to that placement changing every year. Insurers are also turning increasingly to coinsurance from flat-rate co-payments for prescriptions, which can cause your drug costs to spike. To avoid unwelcome surprises at the pharmacy counter, compile a list of all your medications and then dive into the details of the various plans available to you. Doing so could end up saving you more money. Hunt for bargains If you've been relying on the same pharmacy for years, you might want to call around to check prices charged by competitors. Some big box retailers, including Costco and Wal-Mart offer special prices on many generic drugs. A Consumer Reports study of prices of popular drugs found that Costco had the lowest cash prices overall, so that may be a good place to start. Another option is to visit GoodRx.com, an online website that provides local price information as well as coupons. Paying for your prescriptions, rather than running them through your insurance, could end up saving you a bundle. Similarly, you may be able to reduce your out-of-pocket Part B expenses by shopping around for healthcare services. For example, in-store healthcare clinics can provide less costly care than an emergency room visit for non-emergencies that happen outside of doctor's hours.

Business Stocks surge on Deutsche Bank deal talk Sunday Herald SunOctober 1, 2016 8:21pm US stocks have risen strongly as financial shares surged on news that Deutsche Bank was near a settlement with US regulators over its sale of toxic mortgage bonds before the financial crisis. US-traded shares of Deutsche Bank surged 14 per cent on news that it is near a deal to pay $5.4 billion to resolve the matter, an insider said. That is much smaller than the $14 billion figure US officials initially targeted that had raised worries about Deutsche Bank’s capital position. The news bolstered shares of US banks especially, after the German’s bank’s troubles had threatened to spill over into the financial system more broadly. Citgroup and Bank of America both won more than 3 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.9 per cent to 18,308.15. The broad-based S&P 500 jumped 0.8 per cent to 2168.27, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.8 per cent to 5312. Dow members ExxonMobil and Chevron rose 1 per cent and 1.6 per cent respectively as US oil prices advanced following Wednesday’s agreement of major oil producers to cut output. Big-box store Costco Wholesale jumped 3.4 per cent as it reported that fourth-quarter earnings edged up 2 per cent to $779 million behind a two per cent gain in sales to $35.7 billion. Costco’s rivals in retail also climbed, with Wal-Mart Stores gaining 2 per cent and Target 1.4 per cent. Spice company McCormick climbed 2.6 per cent after reporting a 31 per cent rise in third-quarter profit.

"We don’t buy that for a minute," Galanti said during Costco's earnings call Thursday, referring to previous reports that dubbed his company "Amazon-proof" or "Internet-proof." Galanti also admitted that he'd expect internet retailers to continue to make an impact on traditional big box retailers. Earlier this week, Cowen & Co. published a report indicating Amazon's Prime membership program is growing at the expense of traditional warehouse club brands like Costco and Sam's Club. "At the end of the day, we will expect that. The internet in general is going to take its percentage of different categories," he said during the call. Instead, Galanti said Costco will continue to focus on improving its in-store experience, while slowly expanding its online presence as well — although he doesn't see the company offering on-demand delivery service, like food deliveries, any time soon. "Our value proposition is best served for us when it’s in-store getting members to come in and buying when they can see everything there that we have," he said. One area Galanti cited as seeing more expansion was the apparel business. He said Costco has seen strong growth in the space for three consecutive years and that "a lot of traditional retailers" are seeing a similar trend. He also doesn't see a whole lot of people suddenly ordering fresh food online anytime soon. The problem is Amazon is putting a lot of resources on both the apparel and fresh food delivery sides lately. In fact, Amazon is already the largest seller of clothes online in the US and second only to Walmart in terms of overall apparel market share. It also offers fresh food delivery in dozens of cities, while the company's rumored to be doubling down on its last-mile delivery network in part to further improve its on-demand offerings.

Restaurants Real Estate Home Business Homemade chili gains ground on Chili’s ; | • As an increasing number of people opt to dine in, sales slump at some chains print Share | e-mail Facebook Tweet StumbleUpon Google 2810761 false Caitlin Ochs / The New York Times John Reynolds enjoys a homemade turkey chili at home in New York. People like Reynolds — who has grown to prefer eating in — strike terror into the heart of the restaurant industry. “It’s just a financial thing for me — eating out is expensive,” said Reynolds, a convenience store distributor. “And eating at home more has actually had an additional benefit — it’s healthier.” Click here to enlarge image Homemade chili gains ground on Chili’s As an increasing number of people opt to dine in, sales slump at some chains By Stephanie Strom / New York Times News Service Published Oct 1, 2016 at 12:02AM Sales at some of the country’s biggest restaurant chains — McDonald’s, Wendy’s and Buffalo Wild Wings, to name a few — are slumping. The culprit? People like John Reynolds, if you listen to restaurant executives. “It’s just a financial thing for me — eating out is expensive,” Reynolds, 31, said. “And eating at home more has actually had an additional benefit — it’s healthier.” Such words strike terror into the heart of the restaurant industry, which has blamed a crash in food prices that has made groceries cheaper for its woes. Egg prices, for instance, hit a 10-year low this summer, and beef prices are lower than they have been in more than three years. The gap between grocery and restaurant prices adds to a variety of other factors putting pressure on the restaurant business, especially the fast-food segment. Americans now have a greater interest in healthy foods. They also have more and better choices of prepared food in grocery stores, and many options for meal kit and grocery delivery services, all of which make eating at home easier. It is unclear whether these changes add up to a temporary change or the start of a major reversal in where people eat. For the past couple of decades, the general direction of food spending in the United States has been toward restaurants, and in 2014, dining out eclipsed home cooking for the first time, according to the United States Agriculture Department. Yet the Agriculture Department statistics, and individual restaurant sales figures, strongly suggest that Americans are revisiting the kitchen table. In January, for instance, people spent more in supermarkets than in restaurants, an aberration that was repeated in June. (The department’s data from the Census Bureau is somewhat imprecise. For example, the supermarket numbers don’t include food bought at Wal-Mart, the United States’ largest grocery chain.) The National Restaurant Association estimates that restaurant sales will increase 5 percent this year, to $783 billion. But B. Hudson Riehle, a senior vice president of the trade group, noted that the growth rate of those sales has slowed since 2007, partly because of the recession that started around that time. 15209960 View next article in Business     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

Screen Rant You Are Reading: Star Wars: All The Rogue One LEGO Sets Revealed Share On Facebook Comments (1) Next Follow Us Follow @screenrant SR EXCLUSIVES MOVIE NEWS TV NEWS REVIEWS VIDEOS LISTS + TRAILERS PODCASTS TOP MOVIES Comics Gaming Up Next Star Wars: All The Rogue One LEGO Sets Revealed By Chris Agar 09.30.2016 1 Comment 196 Shares 1 By now, it’s been well-established that Star Wars is much more than a film series. The property is an extremely lucrative merchandising juggernaut, and everything from action figures to packs of gum will come labeled with the now-familiar logo. Thanks to a collection of memorable characters, a rich mythology, and the setting of a galaxy far, far away, Star Wars has an appeal unlike any other franchise, and people are always interested in collecting the latest tie-in products. A key part of Star Wars‘ target demographic are children, meaning that toys undoubtedly sell like hotcakes. Numerous companies have cashed in on Star Wars’ popularity over the years, with one of the best-known examples being LEGO. They’ve been offering themed sets from the films dating back to The Phantom Menace in 1999, and with Disney releasing a new movie annually, they have plenty of opportunities to add to their already impressive list of kits. Now that Rogue Friday is here, the Rogue One: A Star Wars Story LEGOs are available. Master builders can have some pretty wild battles between the Rebels and the Empire just from this first wave of products. There are five vehicles (including the new U-Wing and TIE Striker) that all come with mini figures so people can recreate (possible) sequences from the movie. LEGO is also continuing their Buildable Figures line, with models for Jyn Erso, K-2SO, and the Imperial Death Trooper. Check out images of them all in the gallery below: In addition to the toys, LEGO also unveiled a fun riff on the popular “Find the Panda” puzzles with an amusing “Find the Death Trooper” picture (we’ve included it in the gallery). In it, one of the new Imperial Death troopers is not-so-subtly hiding amongst a squad of regular stormtroopers, sticking his head out for all to see. Over the years, LEGO has become known for their sense of humor, and this is just another example of that. Savvy moviegoers know that sometimes, tie-in toys can contain bits of information that haven’t been revealed yet, but it would appear that these LEGO sets are “clean,” as it were. All of the ships and vehicles have already been displayed in previous marketing materials, and the situations depicted (the ragtag Alliance fighters go head-to-head against the Empire) were fairly obvious based on what’s been shown in the trailers. With the basic premise of Rogue One being common knowledge, fans can use their imagination and make their own adventures as Jyn Erso and company try to steal the Death Star plans. This is part of the fun of buying Star Wars toys, as the Go Rogue video series has illustrated. And with a video contest now underway, people have all the more incentive to get building.

Screen Rant You Are Reading: Star Wars: Rogue One Figures By Sideshow Collectibles – A Complete Guide Share On Facebook Comments (2) Next Follow Us Follow @screenrant SR EXCLUSIVES MOVIE NEWS TV NEWS REVIEWS VIDEOS LISTS + TRAILERS PODCASTS TOP MOVIES Comics Gaming Up Next Star Wars: Rogue One Figures By Sideshow Collectibles – A Complete Guide By Chris Agar 09.30.2016 2 Comments 47 Shares 2 Rogue Friday (September 30, 2016) was a big day for Star Wars fans, since it marked the first time they could purchase official merchandise from this December’s Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. Just about every Lucasfilm licensing partner from Topps to Hasbro has gotten in on the fun, releasing images of the products they’re offering consumers as the countdown to the spinoff film marches on. People are already adding to their collections, scooping up the items they most desire for display or play purposes. In regards to the former of those two, Sideshow Collectibles has fans covered. For years, they have produced strikingly realistic figures based on characters from all kinds of pop culture brands. Star Wars, of course, represents a gold mine for them, and with Rogue One quickly approaching theaters, Sideshow is looking to capitalize on the anticipation with a new line of their famous 1/6 scale figures. Hot Toys has already unveiled their new Darth Vader, and now the rest of the bunch have been revealed. Details were released today about five upcoming 1/6 figures: the aforementioned Vader, an Imperial TIE Fighter pilot, an Imperial shoretrooper, an Imperial stormtrooper in Jedha patrol mode, and Luke Skywalker from Star Wars: The Force Awakens. You can check out images of them all in the gallery below: As one would expect, each one has special features that make it a must-have. The TIE pilot comes with an updated helmet and paint job to match what’s seen in Rogue One and an armor sculpt with life-support pack hoses. The Jedha patrol stormtrooper is only available in select markets as an exclusive to Sideshow and has a figure stand with a backdrop modeled after a scene from the movie. Hot Toys’ shoretrooper is designed with weathering effects on the helmet and armor for a more accurate depiction, and the Luke Skywalker figure includes interchangeable hands for different poses and a Resistance themed figure base. We’ve extensively covered the Vader in another post. With the exception of the stormtrooper (which is expected to be released between October and December 2016), all the figures will be available in the first quarter of 2017. It shouldn’t surprise anyone that the new figures are beautifully crafted and definitely live up to Sideshow’s high standards that they’ve set for themselves. Of this grouping, the one that will arguably be in the highest demand is the Luke Skywalker, in part because the Force Awakens version of the character has barely made the jump to merchandise. Despite his brief appearance in Episode VII, there’s much excitement surrounding the elder Jedi in the sequel trilogy, with Star Wars: Episode VIII rumors hinting at a very powerful Force user. If what’s been reported is accurate, many will want to celebrate the sequel trilogy Luke by purchasing his Sideshow figure. Each Star Wars film that’s featured stormtroopers has provided a new variation of the armor, and Sideshow has turned just about every one of them into a figure. Since it’s the latest iteration, the shoretrooper is the one that’s the most eye-catching, with the blue breastplate making it more colorful than the other Imperial soldiers. The Death troopers are poised to be the breakout scene stealers in Rogue One, but the shoretroopers are sure to find their fair share of fans as well. Sideshow wouldn’t have moved forward on any of these unless they were confident they would sell, and they will probably make a pretty penny when it’s all said and done.
