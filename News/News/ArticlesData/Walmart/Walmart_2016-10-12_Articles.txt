But, are you shopping as strategically as you should at both retailers? "Target and Walmart are known for their low prices," said Mark Mazza, co-founder and CEO of PromoCodeWatch.com. "But not all products are created equal — or sold equally, that is." The truth is, many of your everyday essentials actually cost more at Walmart and Target than at other comparable retailers, he added. But don't write off Target and Walmart just yet. Instead, get the scoop on what you should buy and skip to get the best deal. After all, smart shopping isn't about not spending any money at all — it's about finding high-quality items and getting the deals that save you money. Click through for tips on what you shouldn't buy at Walmart and Target — and what you should buy instead. 1. Don't Buy Store-Brand Trash Bags... Buy this instead: Name-Brand Trash Bags Yes, Target's and Walmart's generic brands can save you money and are often the better deal. But, it certainly doesn't pay to skimp on certain items, especially trash bags. “The small savings that Target's up & up generic brand provides is not worth it when your trash ends up on the kitchen floor,” said Kyle James of Rather-Be-Shopping.com. So if you’re deciding between Target’s up & up Ultra Strong Tall Kitchen 14-pack of bags and the Glad Guaranteed Strong 120-pack, “spend the extra buck, and opt for the Glad kitchen bags." Similarly, Walmart’s Great Value kitchen bags aren’t worth the slight savings compared to name-brand bags. “Great Value [Tall Kitchen] Bags are $16.53 for 150 bags, but the stronger Husky brand 144-count kitchen bags are $3 less,” said Mazza. “And, though you get 30 fewer bags, Glad Guaranteed Strong bags are worth it in this case.” 2. Don't Buy Fresh Produce... Buy this instead: Name-Brand Groceries Neither Walmart nor Target is known for the freshest, best produce, said Kendal Perez of CouponSherpa.com. Besides the quality, the prices aren't that competitive, either. "I often find better prices on produce from my local Sprouts Farmers Market," she said. That being said, both stores offer ways to save on the cost of food. "Both Target and Walmart are competitive when it comes to name-brand groceries, like cereal, yogurt, condiments and other popular food products," said Perez. For example, Honey Nut Cheerios from Ralph’s costs $4.89 for a 12.25-ounce box. On the other hand, you can score a Family Size, 21.6-ounce box at Target for $3.79 and a Giant Size, 26.6-ounce box at Walmart for $4.67. 3. Don't Buy Shoes... Buy this instead: Select Accessories Looking to save money on shoes? You might find some savings at Target and Walmart, but better quality elsewhere. "Shoes from Target and Walmart may look trendy and seem affordable," said Perez. "But, in reality, they’re cheaply made and consumers can find better-quality brands for similar prices at T.J. Maxx and Marshalls. For example, a pair of suede ankle booties from Target costs [approximately] $44.99, compared to a pair of Nine West suede booties from T.J. Maxx for $49.99." Instead, head to Target and Walmart for your basic and must-have accessories. "Accessories like scarves, sunglasses and gloves are good buys from both Walmart and Target," added Perez. 4. Don't Buy Furniture... Buy this instead: Select Home Goods You can definitely find affordable items to spice up your home at Walmart and Target — but choose wisely. "Cheap furniture from Walmart and Target is just that — it works well for college students, but in the long-run consumers will pay more to replace these items," said Perez. "Instead, shoppers on a budget should check out antique stores, thrift shops and discount retailers like T.J. Maxx, HomeGoods and Marshalls for affordable, better-quality furniture options." But select home goods — such as bathroom linens, bakeware and tabletop kitchen appliances — "are good deals from Target and Walmart," said Perez. 5. Don’t Buy Name-Brand Baking Goods... Buy this instead: Store-Brand Baking Goods Bakeware might be one of the better deals at these two big-box stores. But when it comes to baking and cooking ingredients, experts recommend skipping Walmart and Target for name-brand products. Instead, go for their store-brand counterparts. Find Out: The Best Generic Brands to Save Money For bulk dried goods such as flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, pepper and similar, buy store brand, said Brent Shelton at FatWallet.com. “Most store-branded baking goods are just repackaged from the name brand, so you’re getting the same product at a considerable discount.” 6. Don't Buy Name-Brand Snacks... Buy this instead: Store-Brand Snacks Again, store-brand is the answer when it comes to snacks at both Target and Walmart, according to the team over at DealNews.com. For example, you might want to buy a jar of Archer Farms salsa from Target and pair it with Great Value tortilla chips from Walmart. Other deals experts seemed to agree. “Based on data from my Walmart Savings Catcher receipts, Walmart almost never has the best prices on Wheat Thins or Triscuit crackers," said Perez. "Grocers like Albertsons and King Soopers offer these products for 25 percent to 30 percent less." 7. Don't Buy High-End Electronics... Buy this instead: Mid-Range Electronics Multiple deals experts have singled out some electronics as one of the worst deals at Target, as well as at Walmart. "While both Target and Walmart sell name-brand electronics, including LG and Samsung, selection is limited and pricing isn't notably different from Amazon and Best Buy," said Perez. However, not all electronics at Target and Walmart are bad buys. To score the best deals on electronics at these stores, it’s a matter of timing. "For the cheapest, mid-range HDTV, come Black Friday ... Walmart and Target are your best bet,” added Perez. 8. Don't Buy Makeup Remover Wipes... Buy this instead: Baby Wipes Instead of reaching for the makeup remover wipes, consider opting for baby wipes instead. Watch: Inexpensive Beauty Hacks Everyone Should Know "Target Brand up & up [baby] wipes are hypoallergenic and free of alcohol, dyes, chlorine, parabens, fragrance and phthalates, which can be found in makeup removing wipes that may cause irritation or skin to breakout," said Kerry Sherin of Offers.com. A 460-count box of up & up sensitive baby wipes goes for only $9.99. "For the cost/count ratio, these wipes blow pretty much every other comparable makeup wipe out of the water," added Sherin. "You can find comparable makeup wipes for around $3 to $4 for a 25-count pack." 9. Don't Buy Name-Brand Medication... Buy this instead: Store-Brand Medication If you need medicine, go for the store-brand over-the-counter medications at Walmart and Target. After all, generic medications are usually identical to their name-brand counterparts, said Benjamin Glaser, features editor at DealNews. "Just check the labels, and you'll see they contain the same ingredients in the same quantities," he said. But in many cases, the store-brand version will likely be cheaper. 10. Don't Buy Gifts Cards... Buy this instead: A DIY Gift Basket Target and Walmart sell a wide variety of gift cards, but usually at full face value. However, online sites like Raise.com and stores like Costco sell them under face value, said James. Instead of buying an expensive gift card, make a DIY gift basket as a present, said Jon Lal, CEO of BeFrugal.com. "By perusing the dollar sections and finding what’s on sale, put together a personalized gift basket for an inexpensive, yet thoughtful, gift idea," he said. 11. Don’t Buy Store-Brand Water Filters... Buy this instead: Brita Filters Water is the stuff of life, and you’ll want to pay extra for quality when it comes to your drinking water. “For your Brita pitcher, buy the Brita filters, four pack at Target for $17.99,” said Shelton. “You can get the store-brand filters at a better price — up & up four packs at Target for $14.99 — but they’re not as reliable and don’t last as long as the Brita filters. The value in spending a little more favors the name brand, as does the customer reviews." 12. Don’t Buy Store-Brand Paper Towels... Buy this instead: Name-Brand Paper Towels Here’s another case of quality versus price. When comparing Bounty DuraTowel to Target’s up & up full-sheet, two-ply strength, "the Target brand is cheaper, [but] the Bounty brand is more durable and requires the use of less sheets at a time,” said Lal. 13. Don’t Buy Certain Women’s Toiletries... Buy this instead: Men’s Toiletries Women’s toiletries prices can be surprisingly high. Fortunately, certain bathroom essentials can be found for less — if you opt for the men's versions. Just take a look at men's razors and shaving creams, which are prime examples of toiletries you should consider buying over the female versions. Despite the fact that men's razors and shaving creams are nearly identical and are of comparable quality to women's, some men's toiletries tend to be much cheaper, said Glaser. 14. Don't Buy Name-Brand Facial Scrubs... Buy this instead: Store-Brand Facial Scrubs Rather than jump for name-brand facial scrubs, here's another situation where Target's store-brand version will save you more money. Target's up & up Apricot Facial Scrub is made with the same ingredients as name-brand St. Ives Apricot Blemish Scrub, said Lal. But, the Target brand is cheaper. 15. Don’t Buy Mobile Accessories... Buy this instead: An iPhone The Apple Store might be your first and only stop when buying an iPhone. However, Target and Walmart are actually great places to buy an iPhone compared to Apple, said Glaser. Often, these stores offer competitive deals, including bundles with gift cards, as well as some tough-to-beat prices on prepaid iPhones, he said. On the other hand, you might want to skip the mobile accessories at Target and Walmart. “Shoppers pay a premium for mobile accessories — including chargers, cases and phone screens — from Target and Walmart compared to Amazon and other online retailers,” said Perez. “For example, Walmart sells a Multi-Compatible Wall Charger for $14.98 at my local store, compared to $7.78 for a similar charger from Amazon."

Published Oct 13th, 2016 6:43 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas The Walmart Express Campus store experiment was unveiled in 2011 with the opening of a mini-convenience store at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. But the retailer has closed two of the five stores in the pilot program in the past year leaving many to wonder if the concept will soon end. The Walmart Express campus store at the University of Missouri was closed Oct. 7, after the retailer opted to not renew a lease agreement. Last summer Walmart U.S. closed its campus store on the Georgia Tech campus about two years after it opened. The company did not give a reason for the Georgia store closing. In the spring of 2015, Walmart opened a campus store at Virginia Commonwealth University, just three months before it closed the store at Georgia Tech. Walmart U.S. has just three – University of Arkansas, Arizona State  University (Tempe, Ariz.) and the Richmond campus at Virginia Commonwealth, according to Walmart corporate spokeswoman Delia Garcia – of the campus stores in operation, which is not enough sampling for the retailer to assess the format, according to some retail consultants. When the mini-store concept began, then Walmart U.S. CEO Bill Simon had a mission to explore the small-store convenience model formats as supercenter traffic was being hammered by the smaller dollar store chains. But when Greg Foran was named Walmart U.S. CEO, much of the retail giant’s focus has been to turn around supercenter business which Foran has said is the company’s best profit center. Walmart U.S. will open fewer brick and mortar stores being next year. Wal-Mart Stores execs have said U.S. capital expenditures next year will be $11 billion, with twice as much going to e-commerce and tech investments than to new stores. The retailer is also investing more in store remodels to match new store concepts that seek to do better with fresh foods and include online grocery pick-up areas. The online grocery option will be rolled to 500 locations by the end of next year. Thomas Jensen, marketing professor in retail at the University of Arkansas, said part of the reason Walmart and other retailers moved to college campuses was to try and gain insight into the younger generation and establish brand loyalty at the earliest stage of their young adult lives. “Retailers have a captive market when they are on college campuses and they lease space which is a lower cost than building out their own formats. I understand the college campus stores are a pilot test to learn about really small store mechanics in addition to be a branding effort,” Jensen said. He said the pharmacy component of the campus stores were a huge draw when store the first opened, at least in at the University of Arkansas. He said state laws prohibited the university’s pharmacy from distributing or filling prescriptions for contraceptives. He said Walmart took advantage of this and devoted a large amount of store space to selling contraceptive products in the local pharmacy. Jensen also said this was a convenience for students who didn’t have to leave campus for medications and contraceptives. He said merchandising the tiny format (4,600 square feet) was likely challenging for the retailer accustomed to stocking 46,000 items in a neighborhood market format or 100,000 items in a supercenter. The mini campus format does not stock fresh foods but does carry some frozen food items. “It seemed odd to me that I could buy just about everything I needed to make tacos in the campus store but no meat. It dawned on me that this format would only work for those students on campus who don’t have to prepare their own meals. It would be difficult for a student in a neighboring apartment responsible for their own meals to find everything they would need at the campus store,” Jensen said. Replenishment of small urban-like stores also takes some wrangling, Jensen said. “There’s no way Walmart can park a semi and unload into the Fayetteville campus store. Walmart uses a van from a neighboring supercenter to replenish the store inventory,” he added. He said as Walmart’s business is changing and more transactions move online, it makes sense for Walmart to invest in its bigger stores and turn them into pick-up and fulfillment centers for the online shoppers. Jensen said the tiny stores likely don’t generate enough profit to stand on their own given the limited number of items and remote shopping pool. That said, Jensen said in the beginning he thought Walmart was using the tiny formats to gain insight into how to run really small formats in urban areas like New York City or Boston. However, Foran continues to be bullish on the supercenter format and recently said Walmart would focus on opening bigger stores in outlying areas rather than going into more expensive, densely populated urban centers like Manhattan. Jensen said there are undoubtedly learnings that Walmart can take from this campus store experiment even if it does wind down the pilot in the next year.

(WNCN) – An armed man wearing a red bandana on his face stole a vehicle at a Fayetteville Wal-Mart gas station following a confrontation with the vehicle’s owner. Around 5:25 p.m., police said a man parked his 2006 Nissan Altima at the Wal-Mart gas station at 3421 Murchison Road. When the driver was inside the business, a male suspect approached a female passenger still inside the Altima. The suspect demanded money from the passenger before the driver returned and confronted the man. The suspect pulled out a handgun and fired a single round into the ground. He then ordered the passenger out of the vehicle. The suspect, who was white-t shirt, with a red bandana around his face, and a white shirt around his head, drove off in the Altima before abandoning it less than a mile from the scene. The names of the victims have not been released. Anyone with information regarding the robbery investigation is asked to contact Detective A. Stevens with the Fayetteville Police Department at (910) 391-0053 or Crimestoppers at (910) 483-TIPS (8477).

Published on October 13, 2016. Most Popular The Clinton campaign WikiLeaks keep coming. As we noted in our previous post about hacked emails from Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta -- what WikiLeaks has packaged together as "The Podesta Emails," and keeps expanding with daily additions -- there is a lot of noise and comparatively little signal in the data dump. Though thousands of individual messages have been released, Podesta had plenty of inbox-clogging incoming in the form of newsletters and news-coverage summaries prepared by Clinton campaign staffers. That said, Ad Age is continuing to review the emails for insights about the Clinton campaign's marketing, branding and overall messaging strategy. To repeat our previous note: Though you've probably been seeing lots of one- and two-sentence quotes from The Podesta Emails, we're offering full, unedited messages in the interest of establishing context. Walmart? Walmart Who? In an Aprl 30, 2014 email from Hillary Clinton (identified by her handle "Evergreen," which was previously reported to be her Secret Service code name) to assorted campaign staffers and advisers, she writes, Does anybody know about this letter Chosick article in 5/1 Times says was sent to me? Campaign adviser Philippe Reines replied all, Here is the story the Secretary is referring to, and this is the specific reference: "Last week, dozens of labor scholars and activists, including Ralph Nader, sent Mrs. Clinton a letter asking her to use her influence with Walmart to urge the retailer to raise wages for its predominantly female work force. From 1986 to 1992, Mrs. Clinton served on the board of Walmart." He pasted the full text of an April 30, 2014 New York Times piece by Amy Chozick titled "Bill Clinton Defends His Economic Legacy" into the body of his email. Then, on May 1, Clinton adviser Huma Abedin wrote, We are going to draft a response letter and send around for comment. John, can you help us with Walmart? Maybe Leslie Dach can help? Will want to give them a heads up on her letter. John is John Podesta. Leslie Dach was exec VP-government affairs and government relations at Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (dba Walmart) until June 2013. (In 2006, Ad Age called the then-former Democratic strategist "Wal-Mart's $3 Million Man," referring to the potential value of stock options he'd been granted by the retailer.) In a May 4, 2014 email, Clinton adviser Cheryl Mills replied all, Adding Leslie to whom I just spoke who is happy to be helpful both in content and strategy. He noted that Walmart is not opposed to the minimum wage law - which we can discuss when we are all on a call after reviewing the draft response. Later that day former Walmart exec Dach chimed in, suggesting that the letter from Nader et al might not merit a response -- and that perhaps it wasn't wise for Hillary Clinton to remind people of her past Walmart ties. I think this particular letter can be ignored unless it comes back in a meaningful way. His ongoing attacks on HRC delegitimize his voice, and it's already pretty marginalized. If you eventually need to answer u could simply say that your position on raising the minimum wage is clear to all businesses. You don't want to be tied or held responsible for any specific business, walmart for sure included. Branding Hillary In a Feb. 14, 2015 email from top Clinton campaign adviser Joel Benenson to various unspecfied members of Team Clinton, he expressed concerns about the Clinton logo that design firm Pentagram was working on. All, I have a nagging concern that was reinforced at the meeting on Wednesday and while it's not keeping me up at night I just want to share it with the three of you to address however you see fit. From the time the broader group was brought into the meeting at Pentagram there has been a concern about the static nature of the mark, the lack of action or anything suggesting forward movement etc. Each time we were told there would [be] some exploration in a new direction. We have had several calls along the way and the meeting this week where we thought we would see something in a new direction and we really haven't. To me, a new direction means a new concept something different from the idea of the "window," which is one concept but we really haven't been shown anything else. I don't think it's fair to compare things repeatedly to the Obama mark but I think the process -- or at least what's been written and said about its development, might be worth looking at again. The "O" because linked to an identify that was not only positive and suggestive, it was also reflective who Obama was and what he represented. There was a rising sun, a path or road both of which suggest movement. Apart from the design issues have raised, conceptually a window is two dimensional object and the core quality Pentagram is affixing to it (transparent, open) only get us to the use cases as Teddy says and not to the core qualities about H that we are trying drive and communicate. I would also like to press Michael to match what he said himself about Obama's mark/brand. Designer Michael Bierut [a link to a Wikipedia article was included here] called Obama's branding "just as good or better" as the best commercial brand designs. "Every time you look, all those signs are perfect," Beirut said. "Graphic designers like me don't understand how it's happening. It's unprecedented and inconceivable to us. The people in the know are flabbergasted." At this point, I think it would be wise to do one or both of the following: · Review the brief to assess whether we are or not asking them to execute against the right things (we now have research getting us closer to our core rationale, attributes etc.) · Ask Pentagram to develop something, perhaps with a different team, that is truly different from the territory we have already seen and possibly get 1 or 2 small firms to take a crack at this so we generate some healthy competition. This is not a knock on Michael or Pentagram, who are terrific in the world of corporate branding. But I think we're looking for something in the mark [that] can present the discipline of a corporate brand while creating the truly dynamic potential we want in a political mark. Wendy Clark was apparently one of the "All" Benenson was addressing, because she wrote back the same day, copying additional members of Team Clinton. (On Jan. 9, 2015, Ad Age reported that Clark, then Coca-Cola's top North American marketing executive, was taking a leave of absence "to pursue a 'passion project' that some sources indicate will involve working for likely presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.") Joel, Thanks for taking time to outline your thoughts. I have read them carefully and want to answer your questions and try to address some of your concerns. [This] makes for a long email, but I believe we're at that point. I've also added the rest of the team in here as our exchange may be helpful for everyone. As we outlined on Friday's team call, Teddy and I met with Pentagram on Friday right before the 9am call and confirmed 3 streams of work that they have been looking at for the last 24-36 hours. They are: 1. Hillary. -- we need to determine if there is a similar technique that addresses the inevitability that comes with the period. What everyone lights to is the design asset that the period provides and can be applied to other words with and without Hillary. However what does not work is the implied emphasis of a period itself. There is no debate on what the core mark would be on this route if there's another option for the period. 2. H Window -- while there's lots of positive reaction for this direction there's also more to do in terms of getting the team and the Secretary comfortable to go on this. In her feedback on our call her language of "embracing people, embracing our problems and embracing our future" was really helpful along with "reaching outwards to inspire upwards." How do we imbue this approach with an even stronger sense of her passion and motivation behind doing the job? She leans away from Hillary type or Hillary signature, she's unwilling for this to be so focused on her. While we will maintain this as something to consider, per Mandy and Jim's input on the Friday call, we are seeking other solutions. So the core mark has to work harder to her mission and/or attributes. The other thing we need to add to this is the contextual relevance of a tagline and/or words as was displayed on the Hillary. approach. That combination of words and design consistency really compels everyone. How would we introduce words and/or a tagline within the design route of the H Window? 3. Something else -- the ideas that have been surfaced on H+You, &, + sign, Together, Us, the President's # idea and the Secretary's language outlined above need to be explored outside the constraints of the two existing directions. I think the watch out here is to not get too clever or too cutesy with symbols. You will see options within all three routes on our call tomorrow. On the design brief, we've been working against the version we all emailed and socialized 3 weeks ago and a distillation of the core idea and qualities/attributes was finalized on a call you, Mandy and I had. I recognize there's new insight since then, if there are core attributes that the design should represent beyond the current brief that would be important to agree on. In the meeting last week the Secretary seemed to associate with what we had identified: fresh yet familiar, tenacity, resilience, empathy, creativity, action-oriented, future focused. As to the Obama parallel, we've discussed in the presentations that Obama's campaign execution truly represented a turning point for political branding in presidential campaigns -- they in fact used what many would say were widely accepted brand techniques that companies outside politics historically use -- contemporary colors and iconography, dynamic composition in the mark, the mark to represent truths of the brand, etc. We all observed in the political campaigns before Obama it was largely typesetting with use of flag imagery, stars and photograph identity as the core design assets used. And this use of branding has a lot to do with why I believe I'm here. And why Pentagram and Michael Beirut are here. As you point out on Michael's quote below, the Obama visual identity changed how the design and branding community considered political brands. This benchmark sets the stage for a much more branded execution for Secretary Clinton, and quite frankly a fairly high expectation of a branded execution. But at its core, great branding must always reflect the unassailable truths of the brand. And the best, most compelling brands in the world are singular and relentless in their quest to do just this. We have a gift in the Hillary Rodham Clinton brand because of massive recognition/awareness. Obama did not start with this. At the same time we must create a new, fresh view of that familiar brand in a truly authentic and compelling way. To be clear, a logo can communicate and aid attribution of qualities, but it is not a proxy for the messaging of the campaign until they are relentlessly connected and delivered, repeatedly and consistently. That's when brands take on meaning. As Michael has used previously, no one would look at a red Target logo and think: design for all -- fashionable yet affordable choices for my home and family -- expect more, pay less. But their relentless, contemporary, fashion-forward products and aligned messaging has imbued that logo with meaning just that. Similarly, Apple, the world's most valuable brand, launched with their rainbow apple mark in 1976. It simply stood for creativity, thinking differently. Their repeated, consistent use of the mark along with some of the world's most creative advertising has imbued that bitten apple logo with meaning but no one would look at that mark standalone and say it means Apple is the leader in human-centered designed, electronic devices with a vision for the future. And non-corporate examples are similarly rich in learnings. The Human Rights Campaign simply uses the equality sign. It's compelling, simple and speaks to their core -- being a relentless champion of equal rights for humanity. There are plenty of other attributes that are associated with HRC, but equality is their unassailable brand truth. So, here's the point. We want to create a visual representation for Secretary Clinton that is equally as compelling, interesting, exciting and inviting as Obama's mark was eight years ago. And to use techniques that some of the best brands have done and continue to do around the world. And again, the mark is simply one aspect of a bevy of connection points (messaging, speeches, PR, advertising, web, etc.) And this leads me to explain, if I've failed to so far, why the H window approach is so compelling to us. This approach will represent in 2015 what the Obama approach represented in 2007. It literally resets the benchmark for political branding, if not all branding. It is of and for the times leveraging the massive and important shift to customization, personalization and co-creation. And, more importantly, while meeting this marketplace shift the mark is, at the same time, anchored on the unassailable truth of Secretary Clinton's life and career -- being in service of others. It's not about her, it's about you. It also meets our brief of fresh yet familiar, it shows creativity and empathy. Now, we have work to do. While this direction is immediately compelling and will fuel advocacy from her fans and drive conversation and content around and for the campaign, we have yet to effectively land its core manifestation. And while we're likely to use it in numerous variations and iterations as it is so flexible to do, we have to have an anchoring point. And in honesty we've struggled to land that core mark to everyone's confidence and liking. We'll share some more iterations tomorrow. One in particular introduces another attribute -- future-focus -- and a design asset like the period from option 1 that is interesting. But for this conversation, I don't want our relentless efforts to make the core mark work construed as being obstinate. It's simply that we believe this approach would be level-setting for the candidate and campaign and are determined to land the core mark so we can reap the benefits of this approach. Some final assurance, you will also see completely new exploration to get a sense of other approaches tomorrow and Michael/Pentagram has added two other senior partners into their effort to engage in the work, the limitation until now was set by us for confidentiality purposes. If you've read this far, I appreciate the chance to frame the opportunity, underscore our continued confidence and provide any clarity. A revised deck will be coming shortly. Thanks.

The Wal-Mart Foundation said it is allocating $500,000 specifically toward CARE and Team Rubicon Global for relief efforts in Haiti. In the United States, the retailer and the foundation have been working closely with the American Red Cross, Salvation Army, Team Rubicon and Feeding America. “Our thoughts are with those affected by this disaster,” Kathleen McLaughlin, president of the Wal-Mart Foundation, said in a statement. “Both Wal-Mart and the Wal-Mart Foundation are working closely with non-profit partners, first responders, elected officials and governmental organizations to see how each can use its strengths to help.” In the last 10 years, Wal-Mart and the Wal-Mart Foundation have donated more than $56 million in cash and in-kind donations in response to disaster events. Sears overhauls five stores in Missouri Five Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores in Missouri will be among those that will hold grand "reopening" ceremonies today and Saturday as they unveil new products, redesigned merchandising, new signage and other changes. The stores include those in Cassville and Nevada as well as Ava, Rolla and West Plains. “We’ve given our stores a facelift that will completely change the appliance shopping experience in these communities,” Jeff McDowell, a district manager of Sears Hometown Stores in Missouri, said in a statement. “The changes made to our retail strategy, from increased training for our sales staff to more integration of products available in-store and online, have brought even more value to customers shopping for the perfect appliance to fit their needs.” A new floor plan also includes the ability to showcase complete kitchen packages through the addition of three kitchen vignettes. The retailer began updating its stores in 2015. Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores focuses on selling home appliances, lawn and garden equipment, tools and hardware. As of July 30, Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores and its dealers and franchisees operated 1,123 stores across all 50 states as well as in Puerto Rico and Bermuda. Bass Pro CEO says discusses merger impact (AP) Bass Pro Shops' CEO Johnny Morris recently told Cabela's employees in Sydney, Nebraska, that he won't plant false hopes about their jobs after he completes the purchase of the company. But he repeated earlier statements that some operations will stay in the Nebraska town where Cabela's was founded. About 2,000 Cabela's employees work at the Sidney, Nebraska, headquarters; the headquarters of the combined company after the acquisition is complete will be in Springfield, Missouri. Morris told about 250 Cabela's employees at a Sidney meeting Tuesday that there will be some "slimming down" because of function duplication. Morris said without details that "important, significant jobs" will remain in Sidney. A Cabela's representative didn't immediately return a call from The Associated Press. The company also has committed to keeping open Cabela's Nebraska call centers in Grand Island, Kearney and North Platte, but Bass Pro spokesman Jack Wlezien said Wednesday that he couldn't yet say whether there will be any employee cutbacks. As for the Sidney staffing, Wlezien said, "We don't have an exact forecast yet." We have recently upgraded our commenting system.

(WMT) Has a Tougher Road Ahead Than You Think WMT stock rolls over as easy work is done By Dana Blankenhorn, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Oct 10, 2016, 11:25 am EST     Popular Posts: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Has a New Path to Bigger Profits Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Stock Enters ‘Survivor Mode’ CVS Health Corp (CVS) Stock Is a Black-and-Blue Buy Now Recent Posts: ESPN Strangles Walt Disney Co (DIS) Stock AGAIN Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Has a New Path to Bigger Profits Kohl’s Corporation (KSS) Stock Is Shopped Back to Life View All Posts Early this year, I called Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) the “McDonald’s of 2016,”  comparing what might be happening there to the turnaround at McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) under new CEO Steve Easterbrook. In fact, since January Walmart stock is up 11%. But it was up over 20% for the year in August — this was my point back then. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr I felt Easterbrook had just done the easy things, like making breakfast all day, and that gains from there would be harder. McDonald’s stock is down 3% during 2016. Once investors realized that McDonald’s problems were structural, not superficial, they walked away from the shares. That is happening to WMT stock, and for the same reason. The problems at WMT go deep, and they won’t be fixed quickly. Management recognizes this, but that doesn’t make it comforting if you have money that wants a return now. Structural Problems for WMT Walmart’s suburban-style SuperCenter store format has reached market saturation in the U.S. At its investor meeting on Oct. 6, CEO Doug McMillon said the company would slow domestic store openings, and crack down on incidental expenses like travel, focusing instead on store operations. 7 Huge Swing Trades to Make for the Fourth Quarter WMT also has a demographic problem. The average shopper is 51, and about half earn under $50,000 per year. This is five years older, with $13,000 less in income, than the average at long-time rival Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT). Walmart shoppers are also less likely to be black or Hispanic than shoppers at rival stores, another troubling demographic sign. Analyst Ken Goldberg wrote recently that Walmart stock has been flashing technical “sell” signals for a month and speculators are heading for the exits. He wonders whether this is a WMT problem or a general economic malaise setting in. It’s a Walmart problem. With sales approaching $500 billion per year, WMT is a huge ship to turn around. It is still being haunted by a foreign bribery case resulting from its entry into Mexico, and recently rejected a settlement of that case.  Walmart is a company haunted by its past. Walmart Stock Has Strengths WMT is becoming huge in the grocery space. This gives it an advantage over Target, but that company is no longer its target. And it has taken Walmart many years of concentrated effort, preceding McMillon’s tenure as CEO, to achieve this goal. Now McMillon thinks WMT should be taking on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). This is why it recently bought Jet.com for $3 billion in cash, plus $300 million in stock incentives. As Jet executives take control over Walmart’s e-commerce operations, results may improve. The problem is that, right now, WMT’s online operations don’t even beat Target, let alone Amazon. Delivery is slower, and less accurate, than from its smaller rival. A Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM), NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI) Merger Is a No-Brainer Walmart, in other words, has a long way to go to catch up as an e-retailer, and low prices alone won’t make up the gap. It has deep structural, operational issues that must be addressed, at scale, before it can begin to fulfill its promises. Bottom Line on WMT Stock McMillon warned two years ago that his turnaround would take time and he has been right. He has taken on Walmart’s reputation for poor pay, and those initiatives have proven enough of a success that he could brag about it in a commercial. But giving checkers a small raise is a bit like making breakfast all day. It can provide a short-term boost to WMT stock’s earnings, allowing the people who work at the company to shop there. But it does not solve the underlying structural problems — demographic, operational or cultural — that still bedevil the company nearly three years into McMillon’s tenure. As with Easterbrook’s McDonald’s, you’re going to want to avoid Walmart stock until you see real progress on these structural issues.

Turn your nose up at low-priced cosmetics and skincare treatments, and you might just miss out on some true gems. Here are 10 budget-friendly beauty products that are worth investigating. © Mario Badescu Skin Care, Inc. / © Mario Badescu Skin Care, Inc. 1. Mario Badescu Seaweed Bubble Bath & Shower Gel Price: $10 at MarioBadescu.com Not all shower gels are formulated for use in the bathtub. While some gels are too slippery for tub use, others fail to produce ample bubbles. Fortunately, the Mario Badescu Seaweed Bubble Bath & Shower Gel is equally effective in the tub and shower. Featuring carnation oil, sesame oil and seaweed extract, this gel has a refreshing scent and leaves the skin feeling clean, but not dry. For the shower, squeeze a small amount on a washcloth or scrubbing sponge. For a bubble bath, pour approximately an ounce under the running faucet. Then, all you have to do is sit back, relax and soak away your stress.

This Suave lotion, which contains minerals from the Dead Sea and ultra-moisturizing glycerin, has an invigorating scent and a deceivingly light texture that the skin absorbs quickly. You’ll feel soft and smell great all day. Even better, Target offers a great deal on this lotion. © SCHMIDT'S DEODORANT COMPANY LLC / © SCHMIDT'S DEODORANT COMPANY LLC 3. Schmidt’s Natural Deodorant Price: $8.99 at Target.com If you’ve tried countless natural deodorants with disappointing results, consider giving Schmidt’s Deodorant a shot. More affordable than many of the high-end brands out there, Schmidt’s Deodorant is available in eight fragrances, including Ylang-Ylang + Calendula and Lavender Sage, as well as a Fragrance-Free option. Schmidt’s Deodorant is a vegan product made with coconut oil and baking soda. Best of all, it’s free of aluminum and parabens, two ingredients that health-conscious consumers often try to avoid. © YESTO, INC / © YESTO, INC 4. Yes to Cucumbers Gentle Milk Cleanser Price: $7.99 at Target.com It’s tough to find a good facial cleanser that thoroughly cleanses but doesn’t dry or strip skin. This gently-scented, milky cleaner from Yes to… is one of the best skincare products available for sensitive skin. Drop a dime-sized dollop in your hand, a cloth or facial cleansing brush. Then massage the product into the skin — and eyelids if you are using it to remove makeup — and rinse with water. Thanks to soothing ingredients like aloe, cucumber extract and green tea, this cleanser is sure to treat your skin right.

The cool silver ball provides a micro-stimulation effect, which when combined with the caffeine in the formulation, helps to de-puff eyes. This light gel also contains antioxidant vitamin C and exfoliating salicylic acid, both reported to have anti-aging properties. To apply, gently roll the ball under the eye from the inner corner outward several times. Pat in any excess product, and you’re ready to start your day. © Coty Inc. / © Coty Inc. 6. Rimmel Match Perfection 2-In-1 Concealer & Highlighter Price: $4.97 at Walmart Both concealing and highlighting, this creamy concoction is a great two-in-one product. Use under the eye to camouflage dark circles and illuminate. Or apply Rimmel Match Perfection to the eyelid as a shadow primer that masks discoloration and creates a smooth surface for eye shadow application. To use, squeeze a tiny drop of product on a brush, dab around the eye and blend. While this product is available in five shades, it would be nice to see a broader range of colors to accommodate darker-complected consumers.

Available in two colors, Light to Medium and Medium to Dark, Brow Master will tame your brows while adding color and definition. Apply the tint with the mascara-like end and then comb the hair into place with the tiny comb on the other end. For sparse areas, place a small amount of tint directly on the skin with a stiff brow brush. © L’Oreal / © L’Oreal 8. Essie Gel Couture Price: $18.49 for color and topcoat at Target.com If you’re tired of paying a fortune for monthly manicures at the salon, try a home gel formulation, like Essie Gel Couture. There are several home gel brands that do not require UV light to “cure” the polish, but this one wears the longest and doesn’t wreak havoc on nails, like some of the competition. There are 42 shades available, including neutrals, pastels and deep tones. Essie bottles typically sell for about $11.50 each, but you can often find combos — featuring a color and the essential topcoat — for under $20. So, technically, each product would cost less than $10. © Hask Beauty / © Hask Beauty 9. Hask Macadamia Oil Moisturizing Deep Conditioner Packette Price: $2.99 at Ulta.com Perfect for those times when your hair feels like straw, this super-rich conditioning treatment gives your hair a serious boost of moisture. The macadamia oil helps soften, restore shine and combat damage from heat and chemical treatments. Apply to freshly-shampooed hair, leave on for 10 minutes and rinse. Not only does this indulgent mask offer great restorative benefits, but it also comes in a single serving size, making it perfect for travel. © CVS Pharmacy / © CVS Pharmacy 10. Nuance Salma Hayek Blue Agave Curl Cream Price: $9.99 at CVS.com Folks with curly hair sometimes struggle to find a product that will both nourish hair and provide adequate hold and control. Hence, they often end up using multiple products to achieve the desired effect. Fortunately, this fresh-smelling creamy gel fulfills multiple purposes. A unique blend of nourishing cream and light gel, this blue agave and meadowfoam seed-enriched product is a lifesaver for crazy curls. Apply to damp hair and diffuse or allow hair to dry naturally. You can also apply a small dollop the day after styling to refresh curls.

Cho, The Plain Dealer The Plain Dealer Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 13, 2016 at 5:00 AM, updated October 13, 2016 at 5:03 AM comments CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Walmart stores nationwide are hosting free health checks on Saturday afternoon, Oct. 15, at all 4,600-plus U.S. stores as part of the retailer's second Walmart Wellness Day. From noon to 4 p.m., stores will offer free blood glucose and blood pressure tests, vision screenings (only at stores with vision centers), product samples, and information on healthcare insurance. No appointments are necessary; services are first-come, first-served. More than 10,000 licensed pharmacists will be offering immunizations at all Walmart pharmacies, including: flu shots, chicken pox, Hepatitis A and B, HPV, meningitis, MMR, pneumonia, shingles, and TDAP. For customers without insurance, flu shots will cost $25. At last year's event, Walmart said it conducted more than 280,000 blood pressure, glucose, and vision screenings, administered nearly 52,000 immunizations, and gave away more than 2 million samples of healthier food. The companies giving out samples this year include: GoJo, Pfizer, U.S. Nutrition, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Clorox, Kleenex, Dannon, Kellogg's, Mars, and Vega. Of those who received blood glucose screenings last year, nearly 3,000 were advised to consult a health care professional based on their readings. Walmart said it also detected high blood pressure readings in more than 7,000 people, including one unidentified woman whose readings "were so alarming that she went immediately to the emergency room where she was treated for a hypertensive emergency." "As more than 90 percent of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart store, we're committed and uniquely positioned to provide accessible and affordable healthcare that helps busy families live better," said George Riedl, senior vice president and president of health and wellness for Walmart U.S., in a statement. "These screenings provide customers with a basic yet vital understanding of their general health conditions and ways to improve them." In addition to bringing customers into the stores, the event also promotes Walmart's merchandise and its relationship with DirectHealth.com, which helps people compare their coverage and enroll in a healthcare plan. "We have many of the products customers need to start or continue their journey to a healthy lifestyle such as fresh produce, apparel, exercise equipment, and wearable technology," Riedl said. Walmart, the world's largest retailer and Ohio's largest employer, reported revenues of $482.1 billion for the fiscal year that ended Jan. 31, 2016. It operates 11,527 stores in 28 countries. More information about the event is at Walmart.com/healthcare or at the stores on Saturday.

October 13, 2016 Wal-Mart nearly doubled its investment in Chinese e-commerce platform JD.com and its shareholding scale increased from 5.9% to 10.8%. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart gained an observer role for board of directors meeting of JD.com, which plays second-fiddle to behemoth Alibaba in China. The latest files submitted by Wal-Mart to the regulatory authorities revealed the information, which reflects the importance of the alliance with JD for Wal-Mart's long-term development in China. In June 2016, this U.S.-headquartered retail giant sold its Chinese e-commerce business Yhd to JD. As a part of this deal, Wal-Mart held about 5.9% shares of JD. Basing on this agreement, Wal-Mart also has the rights to increase shareholding of JD and gain the observer role. Wal-Mart started investment in Yhd in May 2011 and the company gained a 17.7% stake with the initial investment. In July 2015, Wal-Mart acquired Yhd entirely. However, the international retailer decided to give up Yhd in June 2016; instead, it started in-depth cooperation with JD. JD's only major strategic partner is Tencent, which has one position in the board of directors of JD.

Richard Brian/Las Vegas Review-Journal Follow @vegasphotograph By ALEXANDER S. COREY LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL A Fortune 500 company is expanding to Nevada, with at least four locations in North Las Vegas. For 20 years, Arkansas-based gasoline station chain Murphy USA had a partnership with Wal-Mart to build stations near its stores. The brand will continue to manage nearly 1,100 existing gas stations near Wal-Mart stores and some under development, but in January the retail giant announced it would take over the gas pumps at future locations. While most of its locations are located near Wal-Mart stores, Murphy USA also has about 220 standalone stores under the Murphy Express brand. “We are scheduled to have two Murphy Express locations open and operating in Nevada by the end of the year along with two other locations under construction,” said Jerianne Thomas, a spokeswoman for Murphy USA, in an email. Thomas added that the locations would create approximately 40 jobs in North Las Vegas. “Gas station operators have seen very strong fuel margins for the last couple of years,” said Les Eisinga, a broker with Northcap commercial. Eisinga, who has worked on gas station deals for 15 years, said more companies are looking to expand in response. “Gas stations have been making pretty good money. Because of that nobody is looking to sell,” said Eisinga. The broker said he was aware of at least 31 valley gas stations under construction or in development stages. Eisinga added that the valley was fairly densely populated with gas stations compared to other parts of the country, but that the added income of gaming allows stations to sell less gasoline and still thrive. Nevada ranks near the top in terms of gasoline cost. As of Wednesday, the average price of gasoline in Nevada was $2.50, compared to the national average of $2.25, according to AAA’s daily fuel gauge report. The lowest price for gasoline in the valley Wednesday was at an Arco in southwest Las Vegas, where the price for regular fuel was $2.23 a gallon, according to GasBuddy, a Boston-based tech company that operates apps to find the lowest gasoline prices. Murphy USA is based in El Dorado, Arkansas, and has more than 1,300 gas stations across 24 states. Founded as a spinoff of Murphy Oil in 2013, the company has nearly 10,000 employees. The company ranks 258 on the Fortune 500 list, compiled annually by Fortune magazine. Contact Alexander S. Corey at acorey@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0270. Find @acoreynews on Twitter.

Since the company’s announcement last year, several of the corporate giant’s competitors, including Target and TJX, announced similar base minimum wages for their employees. A $10 per hour wage is $2.75 an hour higher than the federal minimum wage. Wal-Mart and its competitors are often criticized for paying their employees low wages and for treating them poorly. Many claim the wage increases are a public relation move and that these companies can afford to pay much more. Even at $10 an hour, these companies' workers would still be paid far less than the typical American. The average hourly earnings of all U.S. workers is $23.23. Wal-Mart and Target have raised wages, others in the retail and service industry continue to pay front line workers $9 and $8 an hour. Some often just pay the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the largest American companies paying their workers very low wages. Millions of workers in the United States are currently earning minimum wage or just a few dollars above. David Cooper, senior analyst at left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute, discussed the difficulties these low-wage workers face with 24/7 Wall St. Visit 24/7 Wall St. for the complete methodology “At $7.25, a minimum wage worker with one child is going to be below the federal poverty line even if they're working full-time, year-round," Cooper said. "There is a federal bill to raise the minimum wage to $12 by 2020. But the reality is that in many parts of the country, you would need more than that minimum wage target in order to have a decent quality of life. In most cities in the U.S., you would probably need at least $15 an hour in order to have a basic decent income.” Cooper explained that because of the nature of the service sector, companies employing these low-paid workers tend to view them as exhaustible resources. This explains the low pay and high turnover that can sometimes reach nearly 100% in a single year. Further, these companies have a high share of part-time workers. Indeed, a massive share of frontline workers in the service industry is employed part time. Of Dollar Tree’s 167,800 employees, about 112,00, or two-thirds, are employed in a part-time capacity. Of the 140,000 workers employed by Kohl’s, 77% are part-time workers. Click ahead to see the companies paying Americans the least. 15. Dollar General © https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeepersmedia/    > Ticker: DG > Workforce: 113,400 > Annual revenue: $20.37 billion > CEO: Todd J. Vasos > CEO compensation: $8.72 billion Dollar General is one of several discount retailers on this list. Unlike Wal-Mart, Dollar General stores tend to be smaller, described by the company as small-box locations. They are also numerous with roughly 12,600 stores in almost every state. The vast majority of these stores are in communities that have fewer than 20,000 residents. The company’s core customers, according to its most recent financial report, are low and fixed income households. But to keep prices low, the retailer must also keep its costs down. One way it is doing so appears to be paying some of the nation’s lowest wages. 14. Kohl’s  © Provided by 24/7 Wall St.    > Ticker: KSS > Workforce: 140,000 > Annual revenue: $19.20 billion > CEO: Kevin Mansell > CEO compensation: $8.19 million Department store chain Kohl’s announced in February it will close 18 locations this year, the first time in the company’s history. At the time of the announcement, CEO Kevin Mansell told analysts that the weak comparable sales were partially the consequence of growing store payroll. Mansell is paid more than $8 million annually. According to a 2014 EPI paper, CEO pay and company profits in the United States have risen dramatically in recent decades, even during the financial crisis. 13. Gap © Wikimedia Commons    > Ticker: GPS > Workforce: 141,000 > Annual revenue: $15.80 billion > CEO: Arthur Peck > CEO compensation: $6.14 million The Gap, Inc., the holding company controlling the Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy brands, is one of the largest companies in the apparel retail industry, which itself is one of the nation’s lowest-paying industries. While CEO Arthur Peck is paid more than $6 million annually, thousands of Gap employees are paid minimum wage. In 2014, Gap raised the hourly wage of 65,000 workers to $10. While the raise was certainly helpful for workers, $10 per hour is still less than half the average hourly wage across all occupations and does not help push Gap off the list of America’s lowest paying companies. 12. Darden Restaurants © Wikimedia Commons    > Ticker: DRI > Workforce: 150,942 > Annual revenue: $6.76 billion > CEO: Eugene Lee > CEO compensation: $6.14 million Fast-casual dining conglomerate Darden Restaurants employs more than 150,000 employees worldwide at over 1,500 restaurants. Darden owns and operates well-known brands such as Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Bahama Breeze, and The Capital Grille. The company also owned Red Lobster but sold the chain in May 2014. According to employee reviews posted on Glassdoor, the typical server at Olive Garden makes $4.51 per hour before plus tips, and an average of $19,248 a year after tips. Like several other companies that pay employees well below minimum wage, Darden’s profits have risen. Darden’s net earnings rose from $286.2 million in fiscal 2014 to $709.5 million in fiscal 2015. 11. Macy's © Wikimedia Commons    > Ticker: M > Workforce: 157,900 > Annual revenue: $27.08 billion > CEO: Terry J. Lundgren > CEO compensation: $11.70 million New York-based department store Macy’s operates more than 800 locations in 45 states and employs 157,900 workers, according to the 2015 annual report. Macy’s front line employees are paid slightly better than those working at some of the food service companies on this list, but their salaries are still only a few dollars above minimum wage. The typical sales associate at Macy’s, by far the most common review listed on Glassdoor, makes just $9.35 per hour. CEO Terry Lundgren, meanwhile, earned $11.7 million in 2015, about 618 times the annual salary of the $18,920 average for a Macy’s retail sales associate. Many of the store’s low wage employees will be earning even less shortly. Macy’s announced in August it would be closing 100 stores around the country. 10. Dollar Tree © https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeepersmedia/ dollar-tree-store > Ticker: DLTR > Workforce: 167,800 > Annual revenue: $15.50 billion > CEO: Bob Sasser > CEO compensation: $9.53 million Discount store Dollar Tree has locations in all but two U.S. states, as well as in a number of Canadian provinces. The 60-year old company employs more than 160,000 workers at its nearly 7,900 stores. Dollar Tree cashiers can expect to make just $8.22 an hour, roughly $1 above minimum wage. An assistant manager at Dollar Tree makes an annual salary of $41,466. In contrast, the company's CEO Bob Sasser annual salary of $9.53 million is more than 223 times that figure. In addition to earning close to minimum wage salaries, many Dollar Tree workers likely need to find a second job to make ends meet as 112,500 of the company’s 167,800 workers are part-time employees. 9. Sears Holdings   © Wikimedia Commons    > Ticker: SHLD > Workforce: 178,000 (U.S.) > Annual revenue: $25.15 billion > CEO: Edward Scott Lampert > CEO compensation: $4.3 million Sears Holdings Corporation is the parent company of the Sears and Kmart brands. Frontline employees at these stores are not paid especially well. The average pay of hundreds of cashier salaries reported to job review website Glassdoor is $8.34 per hour. While cutting labor costs by paying low wages appears to be helping most companies on this list achieve tremendous financial gains, this does not seem to be the case with Sears. Comparable sales have declined each year for over a decade. As a consequence, store closures and layoffs have become routine in recent years. The company’s U.S. workforce of 178,000 is down from 315,000 in 2007. 8. The TJX Companies © Wikimedia Commons   > Ticker: TJX > Workforce: 216,000 > Annual revenue: $30.95 billion > CEO: Ernie L. Herrman > CEO compensation: N/A The TJX Companies, which owns and operates retailers such as T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods, employs 216,000 people. The company announced last year it would increase the minimum wage of workers who had been employed at the company for at least six months to $9 an hour in 2015, and to $10 an hour this year. Assuming a 40-hour workweek and 52 weeks a year, $10 an hour comes to $20,800 annual wage. As of January 31, CEO Carol Meyrowitz stepped down and was replaced by Ernie Hermann. Before she departed, Meyrowitz received an annual salary of $19.6 million. 7.

Schultz > CEO compensation: $20.09 million As is generally the case in the service industry, wages at Starbucks are some of the lowest in the United States. In addition to their meager paychecks, the substantial number of Starbucks employees working part time also lack of benefits and have low job security. Starbucks employees have also complained of erratic hours, which can make ordinary life planning a challenge. CEO Howard Schultz’s salary of over $20 million is in stark contrast with the low pay of his employees. His compensation is one of the highest even compared with other chief executives. 6.

This September, a group of female lunch servers at a public school in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, threatened to strike, citing a substantial gap between their salaries and the salaries of men doing comparable work. Aramark agreed to raise the employees’ salaries by a total of $1.20 over the next three years. As of the end of the most recent fiscal year, Aramark employed 265,000 people worldwide, 110,000 of whom in a part-time capacity. 5. Target © https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeepersmedia/   > Ticker: TGT > Workforce: 341,000 > Annual revenue: $73.79 billion > CEO: Brian Cornell > CEO compensation: $16.95 million Target had a very successful 2015 fiscal year. After reporting an operating loss of $1.3 billion in 2014, Target reported net income of $3.3 billion in 2015. Based on hundreds of employee reports at Glassdoor.com, the typical cashier at Target makes around $9 an hour. A sales floor team member earns an average $9.19 an hour. However, Target recently announced it would raise its minimum pay to $10. Based on this figure, a Target employee working 40 hours a week for 52 weeks a year would earn $20,800 annually. Target CEO Brian Cornell made $16.95 million last year. 4. McDonald's © https://www.flickr.com/photos/dave_mcmt/   > Ticker: MCD > Workforce: 420,000 > Annual revenue: $25.41 billion > CEO: Stephen Easterbrook > CEO compensation: $7.91 million Thousands of low-wage workers protested for higher wages outside McDonald’s headquarters last year, one of a string of related demonstrations reported in recent years. The protests are a strong indication that for many employees, including those at McDonald’s, wages are inadequate. Amid flagging sales in recent years, the hamburger chain replaced CEO Don Thompson with Stephen Easterbrook earlier this year. With mounting protests, the company announced a pay raise for its employees, although the move was criticized as a public relations stunt since the increase would only apply to company-owned stores, which only account for around 10% of McDonald’s restaurants. The vast majority of stores are franchises. 3. The Kroger Co. © https://www.flickr.com/photos/fanofretail/    > Ticker: KR > Workforce: 431,000 > Annual revenue: $109.83 billion > CEO: W.

Based on hundreds of employee reviews on Glassdoor, the average front-line worker at Kroger locations do not earn much more than the minimum wage -- cashiers earn an average of $8.39 an hour. Working full-time, year round, a cashier earning these wages would make $17,451 annually before taxes. In contrast, company Chairman and CEO W. Rodney McMullen earned $11.75 million last year. Meanwhile, company profits have steadily increased in recent years. Net income of the Cincinnati-based company rose from $2.73 billion in fiscal 2013 to $3.58 billion in fiscal 2015. 2.

The vast majority of workers at these fast food chains are part-time, hourly paid employees. Based on salaries reported to Glassdoor, delivery drivers, crew members, shift managers and cooks are paid as little as $8 per hour. Most of Yum Brands restaurants are located in the United States. With success in countries such as China, however, 70% of KFC restaurants are located overseas, where working conditions are often considerably worse than they are for low-paid U.S. employees. 1.

Douglas McMillon > CEO compensation: $19.81 million C. Douglas McMillon’s annual compensation of nearly $20 million is one of the largest even among U.S. chief executives. Yet McMillon’s salary pales against the wealth accumulated by the Walton Family, two of whom currently serve on Wal-Mart’s board of directors. With a combined worth of more than $140 billion, the Waltons are the wealthiest family in the United States by a wide margin. Meanwhile, Walmart employs the largest force of low wage workers in the world. After four consecutive years of revenue gains, Walmart reported a 0.7% decline in revenue in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Walmart’s latest revenue of $482.13 billion still dwarfs the revenue of any other U.S. company.

Published Oct 12th, 2016 5:24 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas John Furner, Sam’s Club executive vice president and chief merchandising officer, said the biggest lessons the wholesale club might learn from Wal-Mart’s recent acquisition of Jet.com is how to target Millennials and encourage customers to put more in their online baskets. Sam’s Club is a $60 billion retailer but is often left in the shadows of its big brother Wal-Mart Stores. Furner illustrated that point Wednesday (Oct.11) as the keynote speaker of the Bentonville Bella Vista Chamber WalStreet Breakfast held at Sam’s Club Home Office. Furner said last week at the retailer’s investor conference he was talking with an analyst, and answering a question when the analyst spotted Jet.com founder Marc Lore and quickly followed after him. When asked how Lore might work with Sam’s Club, Furner said running Jet and Walmart’s global ecommerce business was enough to keep Lore busy for a while. And while there are exciting technology initiatives at Walmart, it’s really Sam’s Club leading that charge inside the clubs, Furner said. LEAD IN DIGITAL Furner said a top focus for Sam’s Club is to lead in digital. The recently rolled-out Scan & Go in Sam’s Club has the potential to drive more overall sales simply because it’s changing the way people shop the club, he added. Earlier this year Walmart moved to a scanning device in its test of Scan & Go in lieu of using a smartphone application. In Walmart’s Scan & Go test the shopper still has to go to register and scan the device code before leaving the store. Sam’s Club Scan & Go allows a member to scan the item with a phone and then skip the checkout line. “Clubs have always been a great format for stock-up trips, but I am finding it’s very easy to run in and grab one or two items, scan them, go through the door check and be back to my car in five minutes. That is convenience shopping,” Furner said. “Our members love this app, it’s rated 4.5 stars in the app store.” Sam’s Club executive vice president and chief merchandising officer, speaks to suppliers and the local business community in Bentonville on Wednesday (Oct. 11) about the retailer’s game plan. Sam’s Club recently rolled out the Scan & Go service nationally, with the exception of Puerto Rico. SALESFORCE HELP Growing membership is another focus for Sam’s Club. While Sam’s Plus members have been at the front of the retailer’s agenda, Sam’s recently partnered with Salesforce.com to gain business memberships. The Salesforce partnership is a way to help business members automate many of the membership functions from paper-based processes into a more flexible, digital model and enable more integration between physical and digital shopping experiences. Sam’s Club announced in July it is using Sales Cloud as the foundation of its B2B business. This will allow for quicker automation of the wholesale chain to anticipate the needs of its business members, and more quickly remove cumbersome manual processes. Sam’s Club is also looking to connect the dots of its business members across every club by improving more visibility into the business member interactions with the help of Salesforce’s Analytics Cloud. Furner said the Salesforce partnership is part of Sam’s Club efforts to digitally transform the overall business. He said club pickup for online orders is also widely used by business and plus members and this is being built into remodels and new clubs and is available in all the U.S. clubs. He said Sam’s Club also had success with its direct-to-home program that is a subscription based automatic replenishment system. When asked about memberships industrywide being flat or down, while Amazon Prime nearly doubled memberships in recent years, Furner said there is always competition and retail is not soon going to get easier, regardless of what the economy does. He compared the changing retail landscape as a beast. He said Sam’s Club just has to stay out in front and outrun at least one of its competitors to keep from being eaten alive. BETTER MERCHANDISING Furner said the clubs live or die by the merchandise, because if shoppers aren’t compelled to come into a club they won’t bother with a membership. Part of the Sam’s Club’s merchandising efforts has been to decentralize the buying offices. He said the regional buying office in Dallas is open and there are six buyers on the ground. He said they are using the Sam’s Club in Grapevine, Texas, as testing lab for new regional products adding items like frozen quail and more local salsa brands. He said it’s too early to tell what a localization strategy will do for the overall organization, but so far so good. Another area Sam’s Club has been focused is reigning in the number of private labels offered. Over the past 18 months he said Sam’s has downsized from 19 private labels to the Member’s Mark brand which is working on packaging designs that go from “literal to lovable.” He said items that make it into Sam’s Club have to beat on price and value, with no exceptions. Sam’s Club has pushed the bar higher in jewelry, fresh meats and apparel, Furner said. The company is also working with private label wines using the expertise of a buyer with almost 20 years in wine commerce in France. He said Sam’s Club buyers must be experts in their categories because the selection in clubs are narrowed to one or two choices per item so those choices must be right. He was also in favor of more co-branding opportunities with suppliers in certain categories in which he said there has been positive traction with a few products. Furner also said the move away from standardized modular has been a good one. He said Club managers have the expertise to design their own layouts. In taking away the prescribed layout, Sam’s Club has been able to divert resources and people into the ongoing Member’s Mark branding work.

And in a series of highly paid appearances after leaving the State Department, Clinton praised the company’s practices and spoke fondly of its founder in speeches that were kept secret from the public. Wal-Mart, America’s largest private employer, has become a top target of progressives because of its aggressive union-busting and notoriously low wages and lack of benefits. But emails documenting a continued warm relationship between Clinton and the massive retailer are among thousands posted by Wikileaks over the past week from Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s gmail account. One emailed document is an 80-page list prepared by Clinton’s own research department, detailing the most potentially damaging quotes from the secret speeches. The last four pages are devoted to Wal-Mart. During a November 2013 speech at an event sponsored by the Canadian pharmacy firm London Drugs, Clinton seemed to suggest that Wal-Mart stores were particularly good for people who lived in the nation’s less cosmopolitan areas. “Those stores — you know, you don’t have to agree with everything Wal-Mart does, I don’t — but those stores served a real purpose, not only for employment and low cost goods, but they did become a way for people who wanted to see what else was available to them could go and look, products that never were readily available in a lot of those places before.” She continued: “So this spirit of community that I think is absolutely essential to the maintenance of our democracy, our freedom, our strength, is alive and well across North America, particularly among young people.” Clinton’s suggestion that Wal-Mart is somehow helping foster community stands in contrast with how the retail giant has devastated local and family businesses as it has expanded across the country. The chain’s use of cheap Chinese-produced products has also sucked money out of local communities and helped expand the U.S. trade deficit. The Economic Policy Institute estimates that the “Wal-Mart-based trade deficit with China alone eliminated or displaced over 400,000 U.S. jobs between 2001 and 2013.” The one group that has really benefited from Wal-Mart is the heirs of its late founder, Sam Walton. Today, the Walton family is worth $130 billion. Altogether, they are wealthier than the bottom 40 percent of Americans combined. Sam Walton’s daughter, Alice Walton, as well as a grandson, Sam Rawlings Walton, gave $353,400 to the Hillary Victory Fund. Clinton repeatedly told audiences at her speeches the same story about being appointed to Wal-Mart’s Board of Directors by founder Sam Walton. She told the November 2013 pharmaceutical event that “in the late 1980s, probably about ‘86, he called me one day and he goes, Hillary Clinton, my wife and my daughter think I need a woman on the Board and I can’t think of anybody else. I said, Well, you sure know how to flatter me, don’t you.” She also expressed disappointment that Wal-Mart abandoned its plans to build retail stores throughout India because it wouldn’t be able to meet an Indian government requirement that it buy 30 percent of its products from small and medium-sized Indian businesses. “I think that if India can ever get its regulatory system straightened out, you know, we have gone back and forth on opening up to retailers, large, multinational retailers. Wal-Mart just withdrew and it is a real shame and because one of the things Wal-Mart promised to do was to help set up the supply chain for agricultural products to actually get to the end user consumer,” she said. The hacked emails include a fairly extensive back-and forth about the request Clinton got to pressure Wal-Mart to raise wages. In the spring of 2014, a group of activists, led by consumer advocate Ralph Nader and political scientist Adolph Reed, called on Clinton to ask Wal-Mart to raise wages. The activists pointed to both Clinton’s time on Wal-Mart’s board as well as her history of advocacy for women, and called on her to use her voice for female Wal-Mart employees, whom they noted held the majority of low-wage positions at the chain. Unsure of how to respond, Clinton’s aides reached out to Leslie Dach, who until 2013 was Wal-Mart’s top lobbyist. He counseled them to marginalize Nader: The Intercept reached out to some of the signatories of Nader’s letter to ask if they ever heard back from Clinton’s team. “Nope,” Reed responded in an email. Dach continues to be a close confidant; in 2016, the Clinton campaign tapped him for the role of recruiting Republican support for the campaign.

 Cocaine prices in the US have barely moved in decades — here's how cartels distort the market Christopher Woody Oct. 13, 2016, 9:31 AM 10,316 facebook linkedin twitter email print Workers during an eradication operation at a coca-leaf plantation near San Miguel, southern Putumayo province, Colombia, August 15 2012.REUTERS/Fredy Builes See Also 'Blood, sweat, and tears': What a Trump presidency could mean for the Western Hemisphere 'The agents are bought': A cartel enforcer says US border agents are on his payroll The Palace of Justice siege: 31 years since rebels unleashed Colombia's 'holocaust' Efforts to staunch the flow of cocaine in recent years have focused on the source — ripping coca plants out of the ground or dousing them with herbicide. And attacking cocaine production at the source has yielded some success at the beginning of that supply chain. In 2014, Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru — the drug's three biggest producers — destroyed some 300,000 acres of the crop, up from 15,000 in 1994. "When you look back, we've seen that there has been a pretty effective interruption of the supply of coca," Tom Wainwright, the former Economist reporter in Mexico City and author of "Narconomics," told Business Insider earlier this year. But the drag created on the production of the cocaine that's shunted north toward the voracious US market doesn't seem to be reflected in the price of the drug on US streets in recent years. "The price of cocaine in the United States has hardly moved," Wainwright said. "In the past couple of decades it's been about $150 per pure gram, and that's barely budged, so there's a puzzle there." The static nature of cocaine prices can likely be explained by the hold cartels and other traffickers have over the cocaine market at its origins — specifically their ability to dictate prices to producers. Wainwright elaborated: "What's really going on there is that the cartels in parts of South America have what economists call a monopsony, which is like a monopoly of demand for a particular product — they're the main buyers by far." "And what this means is that even when the supply is interrupted or restricted the farmers there aren't able to push up the price in the way that you'd expect, because the cartels there have this kind of Walmart-like grip on the market, which means that they can say, 'Sorry guys, we're the only buyer in this region, the price stays where it is.'" Wainwright explained the Walmart comparison in his book. For farmers and manufacturers, "Their complaint is that Walmart and other big chains have such a big share of the groceries market that they are able more or less to dictate terms to their suppliers." Average prices of cocaine in the US at the retail and distributor level over the past 30 years.US government data "In the same way that a monopolist can dictate prices to its consumers, who have no one else to buy from, a monopsonist can dictate prices to its suppliers, who have no one else to sell to," Wainwright writes. Walmart, one of the world's biggest retailers, and the drug cartels that control the world's cocaine market are vastly different enterprises — most significantly in that Walmart is a legal business operating in accordance with national and local regulations, while cartels are organized-crime groups operating outside the law. But they are both businesses, with similar dynamics. Just as Walmart's suppliers can strain under the low prices that the retailer can dictate, coca farmers are caught between pressure on their crops from authorities and prices dictated by traffickers. "And so the effect of all these interruptions of supply" from eradication efforts, Wainwright said, "are to really squeeze the farmers. It's not hitting the cartels. It's not hitting the consumers in the States or in Europe. The people that it's really damaging are the farmers who grow this stuff." 'The real drugs millionaires are right here in the United States' Coca goes through several stages to become cocaine, with value added at each step. To produce a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of pure cocaine requires about a ton of fresh coca leaf, Wainwright told Business Insider. "It then gets dried out, it weighs a bit less, but that ton of leaf to start with costs only about $400 or $500 in Colombia," he said. Farmers who process that coca leaf into a base paste and then sell that to traffickers can get about $900 a kilo, an Associated Press report earlier this year found. Once that paste is turned into cocaine and shipped north, it can fetch between $10,000 and $20,000 a kilo, depending on where it arrives. In this January 7, 2016, photo, coca paste ready for sale sits in the kitchen of a home in the mountain region of Antioquia, Colombia. Later, at some point along the way, the paste is made into cocaine that is eventually sold on the streets of such places as New York and Amsterdam for many thousands of dollars.AP Photo/Rodrigo Abd "Then, by the time it makes it to dealers, it's worth maybe more like $70,000, $80,000, and by the time they cut it into grams, sometimes dilute it, a pure kilo is worth equivalent of about $150,000, so the markup is gigantic," Wainwright said. The actual price paid by the street-level customer can vary based on location, purity, and other factors. But overall, "You're going from hundreds of dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars. That's why the profits involved in this business are just so sky-high," he added. According to Wainwright, the pressure eradication efforts put on cocaine's source have little impact on the consumer. "Imagine that through eradicating coca plants in Colombia, you managed to double the price coca leaf from, say, $400 to $800," he said. If all that extra cost lands on the US buyer, the price of that pure kilo is only $150,400. "You've increased the cost of the raw material by 100%, and you've only increased the price of final product by less than 1%," Wainwright said. "The economics of the war on drug just don't add up."

Published Oct 12th, 2016 12:41 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Editor’s note: The Supply Side section of Talk Business & Politics focuses on the companies, organizations, issues and individuals engaged in providing products and services to retailers. The Supply Side is managed by Talk Business & Politics and sponsored by Propak Logistics. ––––––––––––––––– Rogers-based Pioneer Products recently took bold steps to create a closed-loop business model which included more control of its plastics resin business from start to finish. Pioneer, which sells a 45-gallon wheeled plastic trash can in more than 3,800 stores, purchased resin maker Sable Polymer in Flowery Branch, Ga., earlier this summer for an undisclosed sum. For at least five years Pioneer has been supplying this sustainable trash can to Walmart, contracting out several pieces through the supply chain. But with its recent acquisition of Sable Polymer, Pioneer can control more of the business as well as expand with new products and applications. The sustainable focus of Pioneer is also in line with Walmart’s efforts to sell more earth-friendly products and require sustainable manufacturing processes. Pioneer is one of four sustainable businesses owned by parent Ecoark Holdings (OTC: EARK) which raised $17.4 million with a public offering in July after its acquisition of Magnolia Solar, another one of its portfolio businesses. Former Wal-Mart executive Randy May is the CEO of Ecoark which continues to invest and grow its portfolio of companies. Roshan Weerasinghe, chief operating officer for Pioneer, told Talk Business & Politics Pioneer sought to grow its share of an $8 billion plastics polymer business and the best way to do that as product supplier was to own more of the manufacturing process while working to create a closed loop from source to retail shelf with Pioneer having more touch points along the way. Weerasinghe has a retail background and has been with Pioneer for about two years, prior to that he worked in operations, global sourcing and logistics for Wal-Mart. He said he loved retail but after 18 years he needed change. THE RECYCLING PROCESS Pioneer sources plastic bakery icing buckets and other waste/returns at Walmart U.S. return centers, which is then sent to the Sable Polymer facility and put through a proprietary process to produce resin pellets. Pioneer then contracts with a plastic fabricator who makes the trash cans which Pioneer then sells back to Walmart. Weerasinghe said the fabricator does not wish to be named, but is a Wal-Mart approved U.S. manufacturing site. Weerasinghe said the sorting and culling of source material is a difficult process because not all plastic is the same. He said some includes chemicals that render it unusable for some applications and creates another market of plastic wastes which are sold off. He said plastic water bottles and shopping bags are not the right kind of plastic and not used by Pioneer which focuses on hard plastic resin waste products as its source for making recycled pellets. As Pioneer sells the trash cans back to Walmart U.S. the loop is then closed. Weerasinghe said having just one product at Walmart or in retail is not cost effective so the company expanded the R&D team in the Sable facility to look for niche products that could be made from the resin it creates and then sold back into retail. Weerasinghe said much of retail is moving online with Walmart and its other retail customers. That has left Pioneer looking for ways to expand its overall business beyond just the retail application. The acquisition of Sable Polymer has made that possible, he added. BEYOND RETAIL SUPPLIER He said acquiring Sable allows the company to be aggressive with costs. Weerasinghe said recycled resin has virtually the same prices as virgin resin, even though it’s a sustainable product. So the company is exploring ways to improve margins and offer a non-commoditized resin product. He said a new process and material source has allowed the company to develop a milky white resin pellet, in contrast to the black pellets that are most common. He refers to this market as the “natural” pellets and said because it’s white there are more color control possibilities for the end products than with the blackish pellets. Pioneer is sourcing the natural pellet material from a contact lens case manufacturer in Puerto Rico. He said the plastic used has been densified and has very few chemicals – aka, sterile grade. Weerasinghe said Pioneer plans to shift about 1 million pounds of production per month into this natural grade. He said another 2 million pounds a month are made into the traditional black resin pellets. “We want to be a leader who is pushing for this use of natural polymer because there are more applications for the white pellets,” he said. The company is working with the automotive industry that is using the natural pellet in its industrial applications that require light testing. He said the move into natural pellets will also help the company diversify its business away from largely retail applications. The Sable operation also can use a densification process that takes the hard plastic wastes and turns it into a popcorn-like substance that can be made into a plastic-like fabric widely used in the medical field. He said disposable medical gowns are made out of this type of material that has a plastic component. Pioneer Products also has a brokerage arm that helps to rep other suppliers into Walmart and Sam’s Club. Weerasinghe said the company represented three new products for clients at Wal-Mart’s Open Call in July. He said two of the products were accepted in and are now going through the process of getting on the shelf which can take nearly a year. He declined to share the product names but did say they are in paint and food categories. The other product was not accepted in store, but was given the online option which the retailer made to nearly all of the Open Call products this year.

He said the brokerage business is just another way Pioneer is diversifying its business, given that trash cans aren’t items people need to buy every week or month.

 Walmart, the country's largest private employer, just hiked its minimum wage for entry-level managers Rachel Gillett and Reuters Oct. 12, 2016, 1:02 PM 2,181 facebook linkedin twitter email print David McNew/Getty Images President Obama's new overtime rule, which was approved in May, hasn't gone into effect yet, but we're already seeing some consequences. Walmart, the country's largest private employer, has raised salaries for entry-level managers ahead of the rule change, set to take effect December 1, in an attempt to shield itself from unpredictable additional costs for salaried employees. Walmart raised salaries from $45,000 to $48,500 annually for employees including store management, spokesman Randy Hargrove said on Tuesday. The retailer did not break out the number of employees who received the raise. The new Obama administration rule will require employers to pay overtime to salaried workers earning less than $47,500 a year, double the current threshold of $23,660. Joe Raedle/Getty Images "We think the starting rate of $48,500 a year ... would make a lot of business sense for our company," Hargrove said. Walmart employs 1.5 million workers in the US, which includes store staff, store management, and truck drivers. The managerial raises went into effect in September when Walmart paid more than $201 million in second-quarter bonuses to hourly store staff as 99% of its stores met targets for cleanliness, faster checkout, and better service. Earlier this year, Walmart increased entry level wages to $10 an hour and in December 2015 said it would invest $2.7 billion in employee compensation and training over two years. These increases come at a time when the retailer is cutting back-office jobs and announced the elimination of about 7,000 positions, mostly in accounting and invoicing at its US stores. The new overtime rule is likely to touch nearly every sector of the US economy, with the biggest impact on retail, hospitality, and restaurants. While the Obama administration said the proposal will extend overtime pay to nearly 5 million American workers within the first year of its implementation, others have argued this number is a conservative estimate and put the number of affected US workers closer to 12.5 million, which is how many workers earn salaries between the old threshold of $23,606 and the new threshold of $47,476. Last month, officials from 21 US states filed a lawsuit claiming the new overtime rule will place a heavy burden on state budgets. The US Chamber of Commerce and other business groups also filed a separate challenge to the rule in the same federal court. Business groups have said the rule will force employers to demote some salaried management workers to hourly positions and create more part-time jobs that do not offer benefits. REUTERS/Rick Wilking But advocates of the rule change argue that millions of Americans will have their rights improved. Because the salary threshold has been so low, explained Ross Eisenbrey, vice president of nonprofit think tank the Economic Policy Institute, during a press conference in May, employers have been able to render people exempt who shouldn't be by, for example, treating low-level assistant store managers or frontline store managers as executives. Arguably, entry-level managers would benefit from the new overtime rule either by receiving time-and-a-half pay for any hours worked over 40 in a week, having their hours scaled back to 40 hours a week while still taking home the same pay, or, as in the case of Walmart's entry-level managers, getting a raise to put them above the threshold. Eisenbrey also said that 100,000 more US workers would benefit, as the overtime work will likely be shifted to either new employees or part-time employees who would not be working overtime. In fact, a study by Oxford Economics found that if the salary threshold were raised even to $808 a week, 76,000 part-time workers would be hired to fill the labor needs of businesses. Only 7% of full-time salaried employees are currently eligible for overtime pay down from 62% in 1975, according to the Department of Labor. Eisenbrey said the new overtime rule would bring that coverage closer to 23%. Advocates also argue that the rule change makes things easier for businesses. "It is going to be so much clearer now for employers that they have to pay people under this salary threshold regardless of what their duties are," Eisenbrey said.

Dogs sniff out invasive species of mussel in Montana After opening bookstores last year, the online retail giant now wants to expand by launching its own grocery stores. By Zhai Yun Tan, Staff October 12, 2016 Save for later Saved A woman talks to a driver in an Amazon Fresh delivery van in Los Angeles, California, on June 14, 2013. Amazon is planning to expand the store-brand products it sells to new categories including food and household products, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal. Jonathan Alcorn/Reuters/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of Amazon is often seen as the disruptor, the company that drove retail sales online and sent brick-and-mortar stores scrambling to innovate. But now there are reports that the e-commerce giant is venturing into the traditional market of grocery shopping – and doing it the old way, by opening physical stores. According to The Wall Street Journal, Amazon plans to open convenience stores that sell perishable goods such as milk and produce and drive-in pickups for customers who placed their orders online. The company is even developing license-plate reading technology to speed up grocery pickups.  Amazon's project will bring it head to head in competition with Wal-Mart, which is also in the midst of driving up its online sales and offering drive-by pickups for online orders. Competition for grocery sales can be crucial since restocking home refrigerators creates a perpetual market for groceries, and more consumers may be choosing to do so online. Recommended: 'The Everything Store': 5 behind-the-scenes stories about Amazon Despite the similarities in its online strategies, the two competitors have one crucial difference: Wal-Mart, which already has a strong physical presence, is embracing digital shopping to catch up with the times, while Amazon, with its online dominance, is recognizing the values of physical stores. 'The Everything Store': 5 behind-the-scenes stories about Amazon Photos of the Day Photos of the Weekend Their strategies may be specific to the food and beverage industry: customers have traditionally been wary of letting others pick their meat and milk, but, at the same time, seek convenience in grocery shopping – such as a speedy pickup on the way home from work. The ideal situation may be having both online and in-store options, although as people become more comfortable with online purchases, the tide may turn in favor of Amazon’s online strategy. "The U.S. food and beverage grocery market has reached a tipping point, in our view," Cowen and Co. analyst John Blackledge said in an industry report this year, according to CNBC. Mr. Blackledge estimated that as consumers become more comfortable with purchasing groceries online, Amazon may become the seventh-largest food and beverage retailer by 2021.  Amazon's project, known internally as Project Como, is not its first venture in the food and beverage market. Amazon Fresh, a service that delivers fresh groceries for an annual fee, was launched and expanded to several cities in 2013. Wal-Mart currently holds the biggest market share in grocery sales. According to CNBC, it has rolled out its online grocery business and drive-in services to 80 markets and 500 stores. By the end of this year, it expects to be in 100 markets and 600 stores. "We're going to be really focused on winning in fresh and consumables over the next couple years," Marc Lore, the head of Wal-Mart's e-commerce, told The Wall Street Journal. In August, Wal-Mart bought Jet.com, an e-commerce discount store that specializes in offering deals. Online growth for Wal-Mart had been slow, and it hoped that with the acquisition of Jet, it would  obtain valuable technology, pricing software and warehouses.  Other traditional grocery stores and startups are also vying for market share, including Kroger, with its ClickList program that offers curbside pickups and home deliveries. "Consumers appear to favor services and experiences over merchandise," the National Retail Foundation wrote in June, citing Bryan Gildenberg, the chief knowledge officer of Kantar Retail, as saying the group's research indicates that by 2020, customers will spend $2 on services for every $1 on "stuff." Will Amazon’s stores win out its competitors? It might be tough, as grocery giants like Wal-Mart, Kroger, and Giant already have existing infrastructure to deal with the challenges of storing fresh goods, establishing delivery systems, and space for pickups. As Sarah Halzack with The Washington Post writes, "Grocery is something of the final frontier of the online shopping revolution.... [A]nd retailers have had a hard time figuring out a durable business model, since the grocery world already operates on razor-thin profit margins." But Amazon already has a notorious ability to break into new markets and embrace change. It did so by boosting online book sales – and then opening a brick-and-mortar bookstore in Seattle last year. "Amazon is now moving into the very space it forced some sellers to abandon, having in no small part contributed to the decline of companies like Barnes and Noble," as The Christian Science Monitor staff writer Jason Thompson wrote in May.  Next up 'The Everything Store': 5 behind-the-scenes stories about Amazon First Look Wal-Mart boosts e-commerce over more brick-and-mortar stores Why is Amazon expanding to 100 pop-up stores?

Cecilia Rivas said that she woke Sunday morning with labor pains, but figured it would be hours before her contractions became serious. So she went to Walmart alone for some last-minute items, leaving her husband at home with their two children.  'I was really feeling well - I didn't think I was going to have the baby,' she told Fox 13.  Scroll down for video  'I didn't think I was going to have the baby': Cecilia Rivas woke up Sunday with labor pains but decided to go shopping- and then gave birth in Walmart  Rivas gave birth to a son, Matias, who is being kept at Mountain View Hospital under observation However, while she was in the aisles shopping, the pains became more severe. 'So while I was doing that I started getting worse and then I went to pay and I got even worse and all of the sudden I broke water and I felt the head of the baby right then and there,' Rivas said.  Few people around spoke English, but it was clear she was in labor. They grabbed towels from the aisles and held up sheets for privacy. By some miracle, the customer behind Rivas not only spoke Spanish, but was a former EMT. 'And the lady that was right behind me, the one that spoke Spanish, was like an angel to me because she was the one that helped me bring the baby out,' Rivas said. This is the third child for Rivas and her husband. She said she had no idea she would go into labor so quickly when she decided to go pick up some things from Walmart  Rivas was shopping alone in Walmart in Payson, Utah when she unexpectedly gave birth Ravas gave birth to a son, Matias, who is being kept at Mountain View Hospital under observation.   Payson Fire Department spokesman Terry Reilly says it was not the woman's first pregnancy and things 'progressed pretty rapidly.' 'The baby was delivered right there in the checkout line,' Reilly told The Daily Herald.  Employees and other customers had to help deliver the bundle, which eagerly came out into the world in the store before emergency crews arrived.

Both are reportedly doing fine. In the movie Where the Heart Is, which was based on the novel of the same name, a 17-year-old girl (played by Natalie Portman) stops into a Walmart in Sequoyah, Oklahoma with her boyfriend, who abandons her in the store with little money. The girl, who is seven months pregnant, secretly starts living in the behemoth store and eventually has her baby, Americus, in aisle five of the Walmart, becoming a local celebrity.  Read more: New moms give birth on I-80 and in Payson Wal-Mart checkout line | KSL.com Healthy baby delivered in Payson Walmart checkout line | Payson News | heraldextra.com Payson woman talks about giving birth to child in Walmart checkout line | fox13now.com Share or comment on this article e-mail 5 shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Havelock resident shocked as he films earthquake hitting NZ Trump supporter spews ignorant racist rant at young woman Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Mother kicks her young child out for voting Trump in school Michael Moore tries to meet with Trump at Trump Tower Clinton makes final appearance at campaign headquarters Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Nigel Farage avoids questions as he enters Trump Tower Malcolm Turnbull accuses Lisa Wilkinson of 'interrogating' him SNL mocks government shutdown with Gravity skit Terryfing video of ground shaking as earthquake hits Christchurch Trump says he will 'immediately' deport two to three million...

BROWN Police man the front of a Walmart store amid heightened Black Friday security in Paramount, California on November 23, 2012 as shoppers arrive and Walmart employees and their supoorters protested nearby. The US retail giant Walmart admitted on November 27 some of its products were made at the Bangladesh garment factory that burnt down at the weekend killing 110 workers, as anger grows over lax safety standards. The fire broke out at the ground-floor warehouse of the multi-storey Tazreen Fashions factory 30 kilometres (18 miles) north of Dhaka on the night of November 24, trapping hundreds of workers on the upper upper floors, police said. AFP PHOTO / Frederic J. BROWN (Photo credit should read FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP/Getty Images) If Walmart (WMT) has its way, it might just clean up in the grocery aisle. The massive retailer, which is recreating itself under CEO Doug McMillon, has struggled in recent years with everything from customer complaints about poor service to pressure from labor activists to raise wages. But Walmart’s new curbside grocery pickup is earning praise from some customers, who, ironically, don’t have to step inside one of its stores to use the service. Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 71.23 -0.16 -0.22% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 739.01 -3.37 -0.45% Graham Holdings Co GHC ▲ 476.60 +8.00 +1.71% The retailer, which started testing the service last year, said it will offer it in 600 locations by the end of October. The idea is simple: Order groceries through Walmart’s grocery app or on its website, and then drive to your local Walmart, where employees deliver the groceries to your car. “Walmart grocery pickup without ever going inside is maybe the greatest invention EVER!!!!” one woman wrote on Facebook. Unlike some rival grocery chains, Walmart isn’t charging extra for the service. So far, some customers are expressing enthusiasm about the idea on social media, and Walmart says it’s gaining new shoppers through word-of-mouth recommendations. The company plans to add another 500 stores to the pickup program, according to a Walmart spokesman. So far, it’s offered in a range of small and large cities, ranging from Ogden, Utah, to Atlanta. Walmart may soon face increased competition, however. Amazon (AMZN) is reportedly developing small brick-and-mortar grocery stores that would also allow consumers to order online and use curbside pickup, according to The Wall Street Journal. (The Seattle-based e-commerce giant declined to confirm the report, stating, “We don’t comment on rumors or speculation.”) Walmart’s service is geared toward millennial parents with small children. After all, Walmart Chief Operating Officer Michael Bender has written on the company’s blog that finding time to shop is often a problem for its customers. “This new, easy shopping experience is an innovation that’s helpful for anyone with a busy schedule -- particularly moms with small children,” he wrote. “They can shop online and choose the pickup time that works for them, and they never have to unbuckle anyone’s seat belt.” Of course, grocery pickup may also appeal to other demographics who have difficulty getting inside stores, such as people with disabilities or seniors with limited mobility. Despite its early positive reception, the real test for Walmart may be whether it can turn a profit on the service, which may be difficult given the grocery industry’s thin margins. Plus, the additional labor that might be needed for packing and bringing bags to curbside cars could only heighten Walmart’s challenge. Some consumers are hesitant to order groceries online because of concern that the produce wouldn’t be as fresh as they would have picked themselves, for example. But Walmart’s personal shoppers are trained on how to judge produce and meat for quality, a company executive told The Washington Post. The company is adding staff to work as personal shoppers, although it’s not disclosing how that might affect margins or labor costs. “These are dedicated personal shoppers,” said Ravi Jariwala, senior director of Walmart’s media relations. “They aren’t other associates from other part of the store. That’s important, because they execute the service from end-to-end.” Unlike Amazon’s grocery delivery service, Walmart has a built-in advantage: Its 3,500 supercenters are located all across the U.S. About 70 percent of Americans live within 5 miles of a Walmart, which means its locations are “already in place” to create the curbside delivery service, COO Bender wrote. Rival services charge additional fees for the delivery, in some cases because they don’t have existing infrastructure and need to pay for new warehouses and staff. Amazon’s Fresh delivery service, for instance, charges $14.99 per month to deliver groceries and restaurant dishes. Still, Walmart faces a number of hurdles. For one, consumers aren’t all that crazy about its groceries. The retailer scored dead last among the country’s top supermarkets and among health and personal care stores in a survey published earlier this year by the American Customer Satisfaction Index.  Second, rival grocers are offering similar programs. Wegmans, the cult supermarket that earned the ACSI top ranking this year, has a personal shopping app for customers who want curbside pickup, although it does cost $5.95 per order. Kroger (KR) and Giant are among other chains that offer similar services. And lastly, online grocery shopping isn’t exactly catching on like sliced bread. Ordering groceries online increased only half a percentage point this year, reaching just 4.5 percent of consumers in 2016, according to an analysis from TABS Analytics. Walmart was flat in both 2015 and 2016, while Amazon gained online grocery customers this year, the study found. “This is not a sustainable business model,” said TABS Analytics CEO Kurt Jetta in a statement about the study. “Food companies and grocers need to figure out why there is such a high level of dissatisfaction with the online channel before they continue to invest any further in it.” Go to MSN Home More in Money 6 reasons to think twice before moving to Canada MarketWatch How China's richest man is buying up the world Lovemoney The 10 most expensive prescription drugs in America Fiscal Times 7 things you should never do online USA TODAY The world's most valuable stamps Lovemoney 6 Social Security changes coming in 2017 U.S. News & World Report - Money Up Next 8 ways President Trump will affect Wall Street U.S. News & World Report - Money AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More from CBS News 6 tips to save on Halloween candy CBS News CBS News View the full site Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

Published Oct 12th, 2016 8:07 am staff2@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Editor’s note: Each Wednesday, Talk Business & Politics provides “Health Beat,” a round-up health-related topics. ––––––––––––––– WALMART TO OFFER FREE HEALTH CHECK-UPS ON SATURDAY For a four-hour period on Saturday, Oct. 15, Walmart will offer access to free health screenings, education, services and products at retail stores nationwide. Based on the impact of its nationwide health fair held last year, Walmart said it is again hosting the largest single-day health event in the nation with free health screenings expected to benefit hundreds of thousands of people, some of whom may be taking an active role in their health for the first time. The newly named Walmart Wellness Day will take place from noon to 4 p.m. on Saturday in more than 4,600 Walmart stores across the country. The event will provide free blood glucose, blood pressure, vision screenings (where available), product samples and information on health insurance options. Additionally, more than 10,000 of Walmart’s licensed pharmacists will offer immunizations in all Walmart pharmacies in the U.S. Also, Walmart is working with DirectHealth.com for the third straight year to help customers identify their health insurance needs, compare coverage options and enroll in plans. The customer open enrollment program for Medicare and Affordable Care Act plans – Healthcare Begins Here – will be available Oct. 15, 2016 through Jan. 31, 2017 in more than 2,300 Walmart stores, online and via phone. HHS ENHANCES NATION’S HEALTH PREPAREDNESS FOR RADIOLOGICAL THREATS As a part of its mission to help protect Americans’ health following a national radiological disaster, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) is purchasing two medical products to treat injuries to bone marrow in victims of radiological or nuclear incidents. The two products, called colony stimulating factors, stimulate bone marrow to produce blood cells including neutrophils that reduce the body’s risk of developing an infection and decrease risk of death from acute radiation syndrome. Bone marrow is essential to producing blood. Infections often occur after exposure to high doses of radiation. These types of products are used commonly to reduce the risk of infection in patients with cancer. ASPR’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is purchasing the first of these two leukocyte growth factor products, called Neulasta, from Amgen USA under a $37.7 million agreement. BARDA will purchase the second product, called Leukine, from French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi-Aventis for $37.6 million. Neulasta is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat adults and children exposed to high levels of radiation that damage bone marrow. BARDA will purchase both products using funding and authority provided through the Project BioShield Act of 2004. AMERIGROUP TO EXPAND HEALTH COVERAGE IN TENNESSEE TO REACH DOCTORS THROUGH REMOTE ACCESS TECHNOLOGIES Members of Amerigroup’s healthcare plans in Tennessee will have coverage for reaching doctors through remote access technologies starting in 2017. Members can contact a U.S.-based, board-certified network doctor on a secure connection over the Internet via a smart phone, tablet or computer. The plans will be sold during Medicare’s Annual Election period, which begins Oct 15 and continues through Dec. 7 with an effective Jan. 1, 2017, and will feature the ability to reach doctors for medical and behavioral health services through remote access technologies at $0 copay. Doctors will be able send prescriptions if needed directly to a member’s pharmacy of choice where they may be paid by the member’s MA or Medicare prescription drug plan. A summary of each visit is created and can be forwarded to the patient’s primary care doctor with their permission, supporting continuity of care and collaboration among providers.

She’s not Hannah Montana, but she’s also not a wild and crazy girl who will do anything for attention, she says. It’s been a struggle to discover who she is, and to portray that to the world, because she said she never felt comfortable fitting into any “boxes,” and it felt like everyone wanted to categorize her. She feels that she, along with most humans, is beyond categorization, according to Yahoo. She is actually balanced and introspective, she says. Her partying days are over. “People saw me as being wild, and literally all I do is I’m obsessed with yoga, I love hiking, and I’m reading constantly. My life is so positive. From the outside, people think I’m partying with rappers. That was back in my prime.” At just 23-years-old, that statement seems like it would come from a much older person, but Cyrus said she’s been in the world of show business her entire life, playing Hannah Montana and selling a line of clothing at Walmart that was branded Hannah Montana. But when Walmart found out that Cyrus smoked marijuana, they let her clothing line go, she said. “It was Walmart or weed. And you see what I did — I chose the weed.” According to Variety, Cyrus had a difficult time making sense of her sexuality because she was raised in a southern, traditional household. “My whole life, I didn’t understand my own gender and my own sexuality. I always hated the word ‘bisexual,’ because that’s even putting me in a box. I don’t ever think about someone being a boy or someone being a girl. Also, my nipple pasties and s–t never felt sexualized to me. My eyes started opening in the fifth or sixth grade. My first relationship in my life was with a chick. I grew up in a very religious Southern family. The universe has always given me the power to know I’ll be OK. Even at that time, when my parents didn’t understand, I just felt that one day they are going to understand.” [Image by Dave Kotinsky/Getty Images] She said it was difficult at the time to identify with anyone, because she didn’t feel like a boy or like a girl, unlike her ultra-feminine mother. Her mother loves all aspects of femininity, but Miley could not relate, even though at the time, the world was trying to make her the poster child for girlhood on the show Hannah Montana. “My mom is like an ’80s rock chick — big blonde hair, big boobs. She loves being a girl. I never felt that way. I know some girls that love getting their nails done. I f—–g hated it. My nails look like s–t. I don’t wax my eyebrows. I never related to loving being a girl. And then, being a boy didn’t sound fun to me. I think the LGBTQ alphabet could continue forever. But there’s a “P” that should happen, for “pansexual.” According to The Daily News, “pansexual” is a term that means you are open to every possibility. Jennifer Bass, communications director at the Kinsey Institute, a prominent research center on human sexuality, says that “calling oneself pansexual is to open yourself up to every human possibility.” [Image by Rob Kim/Getty Images] Miley says she is neutral — neither straight or gay. What she is definitely not neutral about is her feelings for Donald Trump. She says she is a big Bernie Sanders supporter and she says she thought that Donald Trump running for president was just a joke that would not amount to anything big. “This is not a dig. But I do think there’s something that goes with the Kardashians and Trump. The Kardashians are better than Trump, because they are not trying to run the country. They are just trying to be famous, and that’s fine. We are obsessed with celebrity. When Trump started this, I was laughing. I thought it’s not going to go anywhere; there’s no way he’ll be the candidate.” Now that he is the candidate, however, and Bernie Sanders is out, she minces no words about people who don’t support Hillary Clinton. “That’s f*****g crazy and you’re out of your mind. It’s literally p*****g me off more than anything. If you could ever consider Donald Trump, you never understood Bernie in the first place.” [Featured Image by Theo Wargo/Getty Images] Now Watch This: Dream Kardashian Is Already A Social Media Sensation Now Read This: Lil Wayne Dances To Politically Upset Fans At Flog Gnaw After Race Incident Share 2 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 Author Amy Schaeffer Tags: Miley Cyrus Bernie Sanders Supporter, Miley Cyrus dislikes Trump, Miley Cyrus pansexual Comments LATEST HEADLINES 2016 College Football Playoff Rankings: Predicting Top 4 Teams After Week 11 Action Reince Priebus Named Chief Of Staff By Donald Trump In Controversial Move NBA Trade Rumors: Shaquille O’Neal Hints Demarcus Cousins on Trading Block ‘Steep’ Beta Opens Up To Everyone November 18 Prior To December 2 Release Date Stahl-Trump Interview: Up To Three Million Deportations, Special Prosecutor For Clinton Possible [Video] L.A.

PhoneDog Android And Me TodaysiPhone NEW Call T-Mobile at (855) 668-8976 TmoNews Unofficial T-Mobile Blog, News, Videos, Articles and more Navigation Home Submit News 700MHz LTE map Upcoming Phones HOT TOPICS: Samsung Galaxy Note 7 LG V20 Google Pixel Extended Range LTE Android 7.0 Nougat You are here: Home > T-Mobile sells Walmart Family Mobile to TracFone T-Mobile sells Walmart Family Mobile to TracFone October 5, 2016 Alex Wagner 28 Comments Walmart Family Mobile launched as a prepaid mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) using T-Mobile’s network way back in 2010. Now, six years later, it’s got a new owner. T-Mobile has confirmed that it’s sold Walmart Family Mobile to TracFone. Terms of the deal weren’t given. Navigating to the Terms & Conditions page on Walmart Family Mobile’s site confirms the deal, too. The second sentence on the page reads “Your agreement for wireless service branded as ‘Walmart Family Mobile Powered by T-Mobile’ is with TracFone Wireless, Inc.” While there’s no mention of GoSmart Mobile in T-Mobile’s confirmation today, Prepaid Phone News recently discovered that GoSmart’s T&C page includes the same sentence: “Your agreement for wireless service branded as “GoSmart Mobile Powered by T-Mobile” is with TracFone Wireless, Inc.” Both Walmart Family Mobile and GoSmart’s T&C pages say that these terms took effect on September 1. These services are still running on T-Mobile’s network, they’ve just been added to TracFone’s roster of brands that also includes StraightTalk, Net10 Wireless, Simple Mobile, and more. TracFone is the largest MVNO in the US, and now it’s getting even larger by adding Walmart Family Mobile, which is said to have around 1.4 million customers.

BreakingData Doubt it, they have been very happy with the metro brand. taron19119 No metro owns 25 percent of t-mobile Sabrina Keyhani NO, T-Mobile owns ALL of Metro PCS! taron19119 That’s not true Mac Nasti It was a reverse merger… I think… T-Mobile( a private company) bought most of Metro(a public company), then merged and become T-Mobile USA(the public company). Andrew Singleton you’re right, but everything Sabrina said is still true. Metro is 100% a T-Mobile USA owned brand. Tanner Robertson T-Mobile USA actually became Tmobile US hence the ticker TMUS :D Sabrina Keyhani Tell me how this isn’t true, exactly? Mr.Bean I guess you haven’t been following the news Walt Didnt t-mobile own gosmart entirely? Sabrina Keyhani No. T-Mobile Inc. US owns Metro PCS acquired 5/1/2013 while T-Mobile simultaneously became an openly traded stock company & Deutsche Telecom is the majority stock holder. Sabrina Keyhani As I stated erroneously above, explain how this is untrue, exactly? Bklynman Some dumbass on my job was telling people that Metro bought out Tmobile, I didn’t say anything,he was one those he thinks he knows everything,I just say to myself ok sure. LoL Sabrina Keyhani I’m going to assume you work for T-Mobile, too? Yeah, not sure why people are questioning who owns what. In my case, like you, I think, you work for the “parent” company (T-Mobile), so, we have no doubts whom the owners are of Metro, but, the same answers are easily, enough discovered with a Google search, as I did, just to make sure the answers were easy to find. Metro holds 25% of TMO stock, whereas, T-MO owns all of Metro PCS. Bklynman No I don’t work for Tmobile. Do you? wright1bby Here is how the deal went down…. The terms of the merger are unusual: technically, MetroPCS is acquiring T-Mobile in a reverse acquisition. MetroPCS will declare a 2-for-1 reverse stock split, pay $1.5 billion to its existing shareholders (a bit over $4 per share), and then buy all of T-Mobile’s capital stock by giving Deutsche Telekom 74 percent of MetroPCS. In the end, Deutsche Telekom winds up the majority owner of MetroPCS Read more: http://www.digitaltrends.com/android/t-mobile-metropcs-merger-explanation/#ixzz4NAsE6WPp The company also chose at that time to quit using the name MetroPCS as the parent company’s name and change it to T-Mobile. This was done in this convoluted way to take advantage of the fact that the “acquiring” company was already public and so the new company would continue to be public as long as MetroPCS was the “buyer”. wright1bby The T-Mobile Metro PCS merger was structured as a Reverse Takeover. It is a bit confusing. The surviving company was technically the already public Metro PCS not the privately controlled T-Mobile. DT was the majority shareholder in the newly merged company (74%) (Metro PCS shareholders received 26% of the shares). The surviving company changed its stock symbol and name from Metro PCS to T-Mobile and thus the publicly traded T-Mobile was born without going through an IPO like is typically required for a company to become public. Metro PCS now only still exists as a T-Mobile brand and does not “own” any of T-Mobile, though the public company that was Metro PCS is now the public company T-Mobile. Clear as mud? Bklynman Yes,this has made it as clear as day!!! LoL! Sabrina Keyhani Yes, I am proud to say that I DO work for T-Mobile. Bklynman Cool,that’s great,hope you do well while working for them,wish you nothing but the best in all areas of your life. Take care. BreakingData Didn’t this occur early last month. I feel like I have already heard about this before. SirStephenH From above. “Both Walmart Family Mobile and GoSmart’s T&C pages say that these terms took effect on September 1.” Ricardo Magallon Tracphone is owned by Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim seems he wants a huge share of American market now too Philip He fail CompUSA. Mr.Bean When you want more, you just can’t get enough Matt I’m honestly surprised T-Mobile did not convert them into MetroPCS customers. Maybe it was cheaper to sell the book of business. René Marquardt So no more buying Walmart Family Mobile phones for less than what T-Mo sells them for and using them with a T-Mo SIM?

Employees at Walmart say register 11 will never be the same. “I think we’ve renamed it register baby – so whenever we call for help on register 11 it will be now register baby,” Haight said. Employees say a woman was shopping with her husband and family on Sunday morning, when she told a manager she wasn’t feeling well. She went to register 11 to pay for her items while that manager called 911 and told the woman not to worry about paying. They could tell she was in labor. “The funny thing is that the customer was down on her knees and she insisted on paying for her merchandise and we’re like you know that’s just not important. You know, we were going to take care of her on it,” Haight said. “…Literally right after she paid for her merchandise, they rolled her over and she began to give birth,” Haight said. Walmart employees and customers helped. They grabbed towels and blankets. Some also held up sheets as the woman delivered a baby boy. “By the time the EMTs got here she had paid for her merchandise and had a baby,” Haight said. One of the responding EMTs said he’s never seen anything like it. After 20 years of working in the field, Terry Reilly, assistant chief with Payson Fire Rescue, said he’s never seen a baby born in such a public place. “She was very calm she did very well — it was her third child so she had experienced childbirth before so I don’t think she was as nervous about it other than it was at Walmart,” Reilly said. He added everyone at the store did a good job. Mom and baby were taken to the hospital in good condition. “We’re happy for mom and for baby and the whole family… I’m sure they’ll have quite the story to tell someday,” Reilly said. Walmart has been in contact with the mother and they say they’re happy to report mom and baby are doing well. “So we’re gonna buy her a whole bunch of goods like diapers and formula, that type stuff when the mother comes in so, and this time we won’t make her pay,” Haight said.

Karol Fitzgerald, 72, of Stanton was sentenced to six months of probation and ordered to take parenting or grandparenting classes after she was convicted Tuesday of a misdemeanor. Kent County District Court Judge Jeffrey O'Hara found Fitzgerald guilty of leaving a child unattended in a vehicle after a short trial. Testimony showed that Fitzgerald went to Walmart at 3999 Alpine Ave. NW about 6 p.m. May 21 to get a prescription filled. Her 2-year-old granddaughter was sleeping, strapped in car seat in the rear seat, when she arrived at the store. Fitzgerald testified she could not carry the child and also couldn't get her to wake up, so she decided to leave the child in the running car. She had an extra set of keys with her and locked her 2009 Dodge Challenger, with the air conditioner going and a window cracked open. The situation quickly caught the attention of Gretchen Behrens, who had been in Walmart with her husband and found the Challenger parked next to their motorcycle. She said the girl appeared to be wearing some type of polar fleece and did not wake up when she tapped on the window and spoke at the child. Grandmother in court after allegedly leaving girl, 2, in hot car at Walmart "I saw her face and she was beet red," Behrens testified. "I thought she was passed out from the heat." The Behrens' waited several minutes, hoping the vehicle owner would return, then called 911. Kent County sheriff's Deputy Anthony Ysquierdo testified he put his fingers inside the cracked window and it seemed warm. He also said the girl's face appeared to be "bright red and sweating" with her hair matted from moisture. Ysquierdo use a tool to break a window and get the girl out. The child was limp and only woke up when he took some of her outer clothing off and put her in the back seat of his cool cruiser. The girl later was checked at DeVos Children's Hospital and released to her mother with no injuries. Ysquierdo soon after found Fitzgerald. He said she initially was upset about someone breaking her window. Testimony showed that Fitzgerald had gone into Walmart only for the prescription, but received a call from someone asking her to get groceries. She ended up spending 40 minutes in the store. Fitzgerald said she never thought the child was in any danger at the time, but acknowledged to the judge Tuesday she made a poor decision. "I wish I could relive that day and do things differently," she said. "And I would tell other people not to do that." O'Hara said he doesn't doubt that Fitzgerald loves her granddaughter, but said other dangers besides the heat -- a car fire or a car thief breaking a window and driving away -- were possibilities. "The court believes she used extremely bad judgment," he said.

Tags: heat exhaustion, Helen DeVos Children’s Hospital, Judge Jeffery O’Hara, Karol Anne Fitzgerald, Kent County District Court, toddler, Walmart, Ysquierdo   Karol Anne Fitzgerald A Stanton woman who left her sleeping two-year-old grandchild alone in the car while shopping at Walmart was found guilty Tuesday. Karol Anne Fitzgerald, 71, of Stanton, was found guilty and sentenced on Tuesday, October 11, by Kent County District Court Judge Jeffery O’Hara. She was sentenced to six months probation and ordered to take parenting classes. Police were called to the Walmart in Comstock Park on Saturday, May 21, at 6:18 p.m., on a report of a child left in a vehicle. Kent County Deputy Ysquierdo arrived on scene and found the 2-year-old girl in the back of a running car. He was unable to awaken her, and it appeared she had a red face and was sweaty. When he forced his way into the car, the child began to wake up. She was transferred to Helen DeVos Children’s Hospital with signs of heat exhaustion. She was later released to her mother with no injuries. The Deputy then found Fitzgerald, who had initially gone into the store for a prescription and left the car running with the air on and a window cracked. She had reportedly been in Walmart about 40 minutes. This post was written by: cspoststaff - who has written 11745 posts on Cedar Springs Post Newspaper.

However, all indications are that spending will stay strong in the months ahead. Nicholas Rossolillo (nrossolillo) Oct 13, 2016 at 3:23PM An Amazon delivery drone gets ready to take flight. Image source: Amazon. The all-important holiday shopping season is right around the corner. It has been a difficult year for traditional retailers like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT) as sales have hit a soft patch, but internet retailers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have enjoyed double-digit online sales growth once again this year. Though 2016 has been mixed thus far, chances are that retail sales will be strong headed into the winter months. Inflation is in hibernation Inflation, or the rising cost of goods and services, has overall been subdued in recent years. In 2015, the cost of living increases nearly hit a decade-long low of just 0.7%. The only time costs of living increased less was in 2008, when the rate hit 0.1%. While certain things like healthcare, rent, and college tuition have skyrocketed in recent years, other areas have decreased. For example, energy costs have been in decline since the summer of 2014, when oil peaked at about $110 barrel in the United States. Even with gains in recent weeks, oil here in the states is still sitting at less than half of its cost two years ago, at about $50 barrel. Why does this matter? While the monthly expenses picture might sound different depending on who you ask, on average, Americans are not seeing their basic costs of living increase. With the costs of putting food in the pantry and gas into the tank not budging much, or even falling for some, that means more money to spend on non-essentials, like this year's hottest toys, gadgets, and gizmos. Americans get a pay raise Even though the cost of living has taken a step back in recent years, so has the average American wage. Adjusted for inflation, the average U.S. household is still making less money than they were before the tech boom came undone in the late 1990s. However, that is starting to change. The U.S. Census Bureau reported last week that the average household got a pay raise of 5.2% in 2015. Wages are rising overall for the first time since 2007. While it's still shy of numbers reached in 1999, it is nonetheless still welcome news for many families. Paired with muted inflation last year, that pay increase amounts to more cash in pockets. This is backed up by recent reports showing that U.S. household disposable income -- money left over after the most basic of living expenses are paid for -- is still on the rise and hit a new record of over $1.4 trillion in August. With more cash in pockets, some of that money will inevitably get spent. Retailers are cutting each other's throats It's a race to the bottom in the world of retail. With the internet helping make pricing more transparent and empowering consumers to shop thrifty, prices of goods have been falling in recent years. This is evident in the last retail sales report, where general merchandiser's sales have fallen 0.1% this year, even while many are reporting growing foot traffic. This is obviously a great situation if you're a shopper, but why is this good if you're a seller of goods? While overall sales have been struggling, profit margins are on the rise since the cost to produce items has fallen, and online sales can help reduce more expensive overhead that comes with running a physical store. Low inflation helps families, but it also can benefit manufacturers. Part of the slowing inflation rate is coming from falling commodity prices, the base products used to make the stuff we all buy. Paired with selling costs falling -- in large part to store closures and a shift to the internet -- retailers don't necessarily need to sell as much as they did last year to maintain profitability. An example of this can be seen at Target. Though revenue has trailed off recently, profitability is still at an all-time high from cost-cutting and a lower costs of goods. The same is true for Amazon. The top line is growing, but bottom-line profit is growing faster. Data by YCharts. The final takeaway A lot of negativity has surrounded the retail industry this year, especially outside of online-only merchandisers, but all indications are that the holiday shopping season will be another strong one. Investors in the space should ignore the noise, but with the internet still heavily influencing sales to consumers, how your company is faring with its online efforts needs to be considered.

"Amazon is trying to get your grocery dollars for a very good reason,”  Sizemore told Newsmax Prime’s JD Hayworth. “Groceries, while they are a low-margin business, it's still something that every American pays for, usually on a weekly basis. If you're already buying your groceries at Amazon, you might also buy something that's higher margin,” he said. "Amazon's smart, they know what they're doing here," he explained. "I have a feeling they're about to really upend the grocery industry. It's about to get really interesting. It's just not quite what everyone's expecting."   See JD Hayworth on Newsmax TV: Tune in beginning at 1 PM EDT to see "America Talks Live" – on FiOS 115, YouTube Livestream, Newsmax TV App from any smartphone, NewsmaxTV.com, Roku, Amazon Fire – More Systems Here   The Wall Street Journal cited unnamed sources as saying Amazon will open real world shops to augment its Fresh subscription service that lets members order groceries for delivery. Seattle-based Amazon intends to open small stores stocked with perishable items, and where shoppers can use smartphones or perhaps touchscreen stations to order longer lasting items such as canned goods for same-day delivery, according to the Journal. Amazon will add drive-up locations where grocery orders will be brought to cars, and is working on technology to automatically read license plates to speed the process, the Journal reported. Sizemore said such a strategy is pure genius. “I don't really want raw chicken sitting on my front porch waiting for me to come home in the evening. It makes a lot more sense if you have something like a physical location where I could order it online, I could pick it up on my way home,” said Sizemore, chief investment officer of the investment firm Sizemore Capital Management and the author of the Sizemore Insights blog. Highlighting a wide-ranging interview, Sizemore touched on many hot business topics of the day: Wal-Mart Raises Entry-level Manager Salaries Ahead of Overtime Rule. “By raising those salaries, they're avoiding the potential overtime pay rules that are going into effect,” Sizemore said. “So the way it is now with the overtime rules that go into effect, a lot of those Wal-Mart managers would be eligible for overtime. By just raising their salaries, Wal-Mart's better able to budget it. They know ahead of time roughly what their expenses are going to be.” Samsung Kills Galaxy Note 7 After Global Recall, New Fires. “You know it's bad when they're actual making fireproof boxes to send the phone back. Samsung's having to go to that level actually making a fireproof box in order to return the item. It's bad, it's a bad headline, and it's definitely going to affect their profitability for the next quarter or two. That's inescapable,” he said. “I don't know that it's going to have this long-term impact. I think it'll be a really rough quarter or two, they'll definitely take a bath on their earnings.” Apple Stock Hits Highest Since December on Samsung Note 7 Fire Crisis. Sizemore said Apple just might see a boost from the Samsung fiasco. “You might see a small jump in the iPhone 7 Plus, the larger iPhone. There may be a slight bump there but I don't know that it's going to be something that would translate to multi-year success. I'm long Apple, I actually like the company a lot, I think it's very reasonably priced. That said, I don't know that this particular incident with Samsung is going to be a windfall.”   (Newsmax wire service AFP contributed to this report).   Charles Lewis Sizemore, CFA, is chief investment officer of the investment firm Sizemore Capital Management and the author of the Sizemore Insights blog.

Photos Hot Bodies Candid Red Carpet Sightings Most Important People Crap We Missed Bikinis Store Share < br />this article: Miley Cyrus Sleeps With A Picture Of Woody Allen Now Photo Boy @photochrist | October 13, 2016 - 12:00 pm Share < br />this article: Miley Cyrus stars in Woody Allen’s new Amazon series, Crisis In Six Scenes, so that means during press Miley Cyrus is going to gush about what a great guy Woody Allen is again, because we live in an amazing time where a pansexual nipple fairy who used to work for Disney and once made diaper porn is the voice of a generation. On top of fawning all over Woody, she’s also totally over it when it comes to Hollywood, while of course still living in, and working in Hollywood. Welcome to your morning rage. On where all of this horseshit comes from, so remember that up front: “I had a clothing line at Walmart and got kicked out, because they said you had to choose weed or Walmart,” Cyrus says. “And you see what I did — I chose weed.” On how boring it was making all those millions that now allow her to mouth shart dumb every time she’s interviewed: “I know that acting is boring,” she says. “People get paid way too much for what they are doing.” On how being from a Southern religious family prepared her for being pansexual, because that makes perfect sense: My whole life, I didn’t understand my own gender and my own sexuality. I always hated the word “bisexual,” because that’s even putting me in a box. I don’t ever think about someone being a boy or someone being a girl. Also, my nipple pasties and shit never felt sexualized to me. My eyes started opening in the fifth or sixth grade. My first relationship in my life was with a chick. I grew up in a very religious Southern family. The universe has always given me the power to know I’ll be OK. Even at that time, when my parents didn’t understand, I just felt that one day they are going to understand. On the categorically fake anecdote meant to soften the blow for when she says what “a really great dad” he is in a minute: I am. I had moved, and the only thing that I brought into my new house was a picture of Woody Allen. My first night I slept in my new house, [my manager] called and said, “Woody wants you to fly to New York.” I loved working with Woody. You do like two takes. He just wants to go home and have dinner with his wife. One night it was 5:30, and the camera operator wanted to do another take. He goes, “I can’t dedicate my entire life to making movies.” The “really great dad” part: I live a similar life to Woody — I live a public life. Until I know someone and I know their story, I never really judge anyone. That’s kind of how I went into it. From the way I saw him with his family, I never saw him be anything but an incredible person and a really great dad. People might slam me for saying that. I’m sure it was a hard time for that family. My family has been through hard things, and I think everyone’s suffering is different. And hey, maybe Woody Allen is a great dad to the kids who haven’t accused him of molestation, or the other kid who keeps trashing him in the press for being a molester. Who’s to say? Oh, that’s right, Billy Ray Cyrus’ gender fluid offspring who’s constantly high and loves that Allen seems to be as lazy as she is. We should probably listen to her sage advice, in fact, why not let her judge his molestation case that never got close to a trial, because of high-powered lawyers, and an intense smear campaign in the media? “All rise.

Of those cities, 12 are located in the United States and eight in China. One-third of the top cities are national political capitals as well as economic powerhouses, and more than half the 42 cities are located along or in close proximity to a seacoast. The data were included in a new report from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and is based on gross domestic product (GDP) or revenue data for 2014. The report includes the top country economies ranked by GDP and the top companies ranked by 2014 revenues. Of the 50 largest economies, only one is a company — Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) — while 13 are cities and 37 are countries. National economies grab the top 13 positions in the rankings before the top city, Tokyo, sneaks in at number 14. Only seven companies made the list of the top 100 economies, and five of those were oil companies, including two state-controlled Chinese companies: Sinopec, or officially China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (NYSE: SNP), and PetroChina Co. Ltd. (NYSE: PTR). The four largest country economies and their 2014 GDP totals are: China: $17.19 trillion United States: $16.49 trillion India: $6.98 trillion Japan: $4.52 trillion The four largest cities and their GDP totals are: Tokyo: $1.54 trillion New York City: $1.33 trillion Los Angeles: $818 billion Seoul-Incheon: $804 billion The four largest companies ranked by 2014 revenues are: Wal-Mart: $453 billion Royal Dutch Shell PLC (NYSE: RDS-A): $429 billion Sinopec: $423 billion Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM): $375 billion Excepting Wal-Mart, the only non-oil company to make the list was Germany’s embattled Volkswagen Group ($249 billion) at number 100. Other U.S. cities on the list: Chicago ($535 billion); Houston ($459 billion); Washington, D.C., ($420 billion); Dallas ($392 billion); Boston ($342 million); Philadelphia ($329 billion); San Francisco ($315 billion); Atlanta ($280 billion); Seattle ($254 billion); and Miami ($250 billion).

A woman shopping Sunday morning at a Walmart in Payson, Utah, surprised workers and customers when she approached Register 11, dropped to her knees, clutched her stomach, and … pulled out her wallet. She was in labor, ABC News reports, but she insisted on paying for her items first before she took care of her next transaction: having the baby right there in the store. "We weren't really interested in taking her money at [that] point, but she insisted," says Walmart manager Dustin Haight, who KSTU notes called 911 and implored her not to worry about the tab. "It wasn't like she was like, 'OK, let's get this baby out and [then] I'll pay.' She paid and then had the baby." As soon as the woman, identified as Cecelia Rivas by the Daily Herald, had paid up, employees and customers sprang into action, with some hunting down towels and blankets while others held sheets up to give her privacy. "By the time the EMTs got here, she had … a baby [boy]," Haight tells KSTU. "She was very calm," an assistant chief from the local fire department adds. "It was her third child … so I don't think she was as nervous about it other than it was at Walmart." Rivas admits she actually was "really scared," though she tells the Herald as soon as she saw her new son, "I was so happy." A spokesman for the hospital where Rivas and baby Matias were taken says they're both "doing well," per ABC. And Haight is counting on a new repeat customer. "Hopefully we'll be part of his life forever," he tells ABC. (A text-messaging conversation about this Walmart shopping trip went viral.)

Every year, the sugar overload from Halloween trick-or-treating and harvest parties can do damage for several days (if the candy even lasts that long). Kids experience the highs - and crashes - of consuming too many sweets, too close together. In fact, the Pacific Science Center states that the average trick or treat bag contains 4,800 calories, three cups of sugar, and 1.5 cups of fat. 1). Homemade crayons: Use up old crayons - or buy a few cheap packages (you can get a box of 48 for only one dollar at Dollar Tree) - and make homemade, Halloween-shaped crayons. Pick up a themed candy mold from a candy supply shop or a store like Party City for a couple of dollars. Remove the paper wrappings from each crayon, and break (or chop with a sharp knife), into small pieces. Place pieces into the mold, and melt the crayons at 200 degrees. Once melted, remove from the oven and fully cool. Pop them out of the mold. Estimated price for 100 small crayons, five dollars. 2). Stampers: Get 50 assorted stampers from OrientalTrading.com for less than $10 right now. 3.) Assorted small toys: Get 100 for less than $20 right now on Oriental Trading or by hitting the dollar store and combing the abundant options. Bonus: Want to save even more on OrientalTrading.com? Shop their clearance and "less than perfect" sections. 4.) Pretzels in individual bags: A trick-or-treat hit, you can get a 40-count Utz brand package for under $5 at Walmart. 5.) Goldfish crackers in individual bags: Loved by kids and adults alike, get a 25-count bag for around $5 at Walmart. 6.) Mini bubbles: They don't have to be Halloween themed to be fun. Get them by the box online or at the dollar store. Also check Michael's or JoAnn Fabrics for clearance offers. About five dollars for 40 bottles. 7.) Temporary tattoos: Get approximately 24 for two dollars at Walmart, or check the dollar store and online. 8.). Mini erasers: Get a huge assortment online from Oriental Trading (currently they have a 720-count package for less than $15), or shop the dollar store for themed erasers or pencil toppers. 9.) Sticker sheets: You can get a book of 50 sheets for only $1 at Dollar Tree. 10.) Glow in the dark sticks, necklaces or bracelets: Dollar Tree has 20-count glow bracelet packs for just one dollar. 11.) Bead necklaces: Order online or get eight-count packs from Dollar Tree for one dollar each. 12.) Themed pencils: Get 12-count packs from the dollar store, or order in bulk online. 13.) Treat coupons: Get packs of treat coupons, for local restaurants. These coupons aren't necessarily all sugar-free, but they are a nice item to give out, and different than straight candy. Booklets of multiple coupons sell for around one dollar at restaurants like McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's. Some other businesses offer these booklets as well, such as 7-11's 20 small Slurpees books for five dollars. These books go fast, and not all locations participate in the promotion, so I recommend looking for these early in the month. If you choose to go with something like small toys, rings, mini erasers or anything else small: Be sure to hand it to the parent or another adult with any child that looks to be three or under. This is a safety precaution since you never know if they may stick it in their mouth.

News outlets report Atlanta police say the victim told officers she was leaving the Park Bench Pub around 2:30 a.m. Saturday when she called an Uber to get a ride home. The victim told police that a short while into the drive, the driver began to sexually assault her. She says the driver then pushed her out of the car near the Galloway School after she scratched him to get him to stop. The victim called 911 and was taken to the hospital. Police were working on getting a description of the driver. Uber company officials say they are looking into the incident. Suspect in Georgia officer death pleaded to prior gun crime Suspect in Georgia officer death pleaded to prior gun crime SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) - A man charged with fatally shooting a rural Georgia police officer had pleaded guilty four months earlier to a gun crime and was sentenced to probation, court records show. Royheem Delshawn Deeds, 24, has been charged with murder in Saturday’s fatal shooting of Eastman Patrol Officer Timothy Smith. Acting on a tip early Monday, deputies in Florida pulled over a car driven by Deeds’ sister and found him hiding in the trunk. He was arrested and returned to Georgia. Police seek pair they say used fake money to buy lawn tools Police seek pair they say used fake money to buy lawn tools BUFORD, Ga. (AP) - Police are trying to identify two people suspected of using fake movie money to buy lawn equipment at a Wal-Mart store near Atlanta. Gwinnett County police Cpl. Michele Pihera said in a news release Monday that a man and a woman made the fraudulent purchase between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. on July 19. Later that day, the woman returned one of the items at another Wal-Mart store for cash. A loss prevention supervisor at the store where the purchase was made told police a cashier accepted $1,000 in fraudulent currency. Photos of the fake $100 bills provided by police show that they say “For motion picture use only,’’ on the front and back. Pihera said the cashier who accepted the bills quit her job shortly after the sale. 8-month-old girl dies after being abused by Georgia couple 8-month-old girl dies after being abused by Georgia couple ATLANTA (AP) - Police say a couple is facing charges in connection to the death of an 8-month-old girl who was beaten with a belt by the boyfriend in Atlanta. Brookhaven police officer Carlos Nino says Kamonie Love Whitehead died around 10:30 p.m. Saturday at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta Egleston. Police are waiting on the autopsy results next week before deciding to upgrade the charges against the girl’s mother Shavone Whitehead and her boyfriend Edward F. Wilson. Both are charged with cruelty to children and aggravated battery. Court records show the girl had injuries to her legs, buttocks, chin and arms along with multiple fractures and a possible skull fracture. WSB-TV reports a legal document shows the mother admitting to using a belt on occasion to punish the child. Groups plans memorial to lynching victims in Alabama Groups plans memorial to lynching victims in Alabama MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - A private group says it plans to open a national memorial to lynching victims next year in Alabama. The Montgomery-based Equal Justice Initiative says it has identified more than 4,000 lynchings of blacks in the United States from 1877 until 1950. The memorial announced Tuesday will include a museum exploring the history of race in the United States, from slavery through the mass incarceration of the modern era. It will be built in Montgomery, near what was once one of the largest slave auction sites in the South. The sponsoring group, Equal Justice Initiative, is headed by attorney Bryan Stevenson, who’s best known for representing death row inmates and juvenile defendants in Alabama and other states. Greensboro council to discuss sit-in museum debt again Greensboro council to discuss sit-in museum debt again GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) - The Greensboro City Council will discuss again whether it should write off the nearly $800,000 that the city says a museum owes from a “forgivable loan.’’ The News & Record of Greensboro reports (http://bit.ly/2b2KFd9) the council is scheduled to discuss the loan to the International Civil Rights Center & Museum at its meeting Tuesday. At a meeting earlier this month, council members refused to write off the loan. The debt stems from a $1.5 million loan in which the city forgives a dollar for every dollar the museum raised from September 2013 to July 2015. Museum officials say the debt is about $280,000. The museum honors the sit-in movement that began in 1960 when four black college freshmen refused to leave the whites-only lunch counter at the Woolworth store. Oklahoma man jailed in killing accused of anti-Muslim rants Oklahoma man jailed in killing accused of anti-Muslim rants TULSA, Okla. (AP) - An Oklahoma man suspected of fatally shooting a male neighbor was accused of harassing and shouting anti-Muslim slurs at the man’s family, who are actually Christians from Lebanon, and of trying to run over the man’s mother with his vehicle. Police say Khalid Jabara was killed at his Tulsa home last Friday and 61-year-old Stanley Majors is being held without bail on a first-degree murder complaint and possession of a firearm after a felony conviction, but online court records do not show that he has been formally charged. It was not clear if Majors has an attorney to speak on his behalf. Jabara’s family issued a statement saying Majors had called the family “dirty Arabs,’’ “filthy Lebanese,’’ “Aye-rabs,’’ and “Mooslems.’’ Prosecutors had charged Majors with injuring Jabara’s mother, Haifa, in September by driving his vehicle into her. According to court records, Majors was charged with assault and battery with a deadly weapon, leaving the scene of a collision involving injury, violating a protective order and public intoxication. Prosecutors tried to keep Majors in jail on the assault charge, but he was released after posting bond on May 25. Majors’ attorney in that case did not immediately return a phone call for comment after business hours on Tuesday. Majors was charged with violating the protective order in March 2014 after Haifa Jabra told police he had yelled racial slurs at her while she was in her driveway and threatened to kill her. The Tulsa World reports (http://bit.ly/2byi02N ) that Tulsa police Sgt. Dave Walker and Assistant District Attorney John David Luton said Monday that it’s too early in the investigation to say if Majors will be charged with a hate crime. × Post a comment Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.

Police say the man conducted the scheme both on Sept. 28 and earlier in May, spokesman Lt. Stephen Cronin said on Wednesday. In September, the man approached a cashier to buy two iPads valued at $1,500. “He was conducting a grifting scheme,” Cronin said. After the cashier counted the money, the man asked for the money back to count it himself. He repeated the act repeatedly, leaving with the two iPads. It was only discovered later, when totaling up the cash in the register, that he also took back $700 of the $1,500 he originally handed the clerk. Cronin said the man pulled off a similar scheme in May. The man is described as being a dark-skinned, about 6 feet tall. He was wearing “high end clothes,” and spoke with a Middle Eastern accent. He was seen driving away in a silver Mercedes. Anyone with information about the theft is asked to call Detective Val Krishtal at 508-532-5923.

The Estuary applied for a grant through the Walmart Foundation State Giving Program and was awarded the money to cover purchase of the new machine and its installation, including the necessary updates to plumbing and electrical, and reworking the stainless table surround to accommodate the new machine.  (See photo at left.) The new machine is a much higher efficiency model and uses about one third of the water compared to the old machine and is Energy Star-rated for increased utility efficiency.  It also has a higher per load speed and capacity so more dishes can be done in less time.  In addition, it is a high temperature sanitizing machine, which eliminates the need for costly chemicals also. The Estuary is the regional senior center serving the towns of Clinton, Chester, Deep River, Essex, Killingworth, Lyme, Old Lyme, Old Saybrook, and Westbrook.  The Estuary served over 55,000 meals in its Meals on Wheels Program last year and served over an additional 20,000 meals at its three congregate meal sites in the nine-town region.  The center also hosts a full range of services, instructional classes, exercise and fitness programs, and opportunities for socialization to local seniors. The Estuary Council of Seniors extend special thanks to the Walmart Foundation for making possible the purchase and installation of this new piece of equipment — and all the resultant clean dishes for years to come!  The Estuary believes that Walmart is a great community partner in the mission to help those locally in need.  To find out more about the Estuary Council of Seniors, visit the center at 220 Main Street, Old Saybrook, or www.ecsenior.org or call (860) 388-1611.

(NYSE:WMT) is bumping up its workers’ salaries to improve the company’s business. Source: Flickr> The company said that salaries are going up from $47,456 to $48,500 per year, which will make for happier manager, happier employees and happier customers. The move will affect more than 4 million U.S. workers. Walmart recently raised its minimum wage to $10 an hour. Additionally, there is a new rule being passed by the Obama administration on Dec. 1 that will require employers to pay overtime to salaried workers who earn less than $47,500 a year, which is twice as much as the previous minimum of $23,660. The $10 per hour pay bump for entry-level workers has been in place since September. The company has more than 1.5 million workers in the U.S., which includes managers, store clerks, truck drivers and more. Walmart has yet to announce when it plans on releasing its figures for holiday hires that other companies have already planned, including JCPenney, UPS and Kohl’s. The retailer is the largest one in the U.S., and it is working on using technology to advance its shopping with self-driving shopping carts. Hopefully these will not cause any accidents for shoppers or employees. Walmart came under fire a couple of weeks ago for refusing a woman a birthday cake that would honor her father and the local police force, as he was retiring after a quarter of a century of service. WMT shares is up 0.5% Wednesday.

Effective Sept. 1, pay for new and current entry-level salaried managers increased 7.8% to $48,500 from $45,000. That came three months before the Department of Labor’s new rule goes into effect. It doubles the minimum annual pay—from $23,660 to $47,476—in which full-time salaried workers remain eligible for overtime pay. “We wanted to make these changes before the holiday season, which is a very busy time of the year,” Wal-Mart spokesperson Kory Lundberg told MarketWatch in a phone interview Wednesday. The raises come about year into Wal-Mart’s two-year plan to invest $2.7 billion in its workers, in an effort to lift sales by improving customer service through increased worker engagement. Lundberg said, as the company has learned over the last couple of years, “when we help our associates be successful, it helps our company be successful.” Wal-Mart didn’t say how many employees will be affected by the salary increase. The company ended fiscal 2016 with 1.5 million employees in the U.S. The stock WMT, -0.22%  rose 0.5% in morning trade Wednesday. The stock had tumbled 6% over the past four sessions, in the wake of a downbeat earnings outlook, to close Tuesday at a five-month low. It has rallied 10% year to date, while the SPDR S&P Retail exchange-trade fund XRT, +1.58%  has tacked on 0.8% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.21%  has gained 4%. “Better stores are the key to us running a better business. And it starts with improving the associate experience,” said Greg Foran, chief executive of Walmart U.S., at an analyst gathering last week. “When we provide them with a great start, a path to grow and succeed, they’ll provide a better experience for our customers.” Don’t miss: Wal-Mart rivals and haters, beware.

The rule will double (to $47,476) the salary threshold under which virtually all workers are guaranteed time-and-a-half pay whenever they work more than 40 hours in a given week. Entry-level managers at Walmart were making $45,000 when the rule came out in May, but starting in September they made $48,500, Daniel Wiessner and Nandita Bose report for Reuters. A spokesperson for the retailer said “the starting rate of $48,500 a year ... would make a lot of business sense for our company.” More here. Story Continued Below GOOD MORNING.

CHICAGO DODGES TEACHER STRIKE: Chicago’s public schools kept running Tuesday after teachers announced a tentative four-year deal with the school district just a few ticks of the clock before they were set to go on strike. The contract — if approved by the city’s Board of Education and the union — will resolve a thorny pension dispute. Under the proposed terms, the district will continue paying 7 percent of annual salary into the pensions of teachers hired before Jan. 1, 2017. Teachers hired after that date won’t receive the benefit; instead, they’ll get a cumulative 7 percent boost in base salary by July 1. Background from the Washington Post: “Teachers — who have been working without a contract since June 2015 — had planned to walk off the job Tuesday, a move that would have forced the school system to cancel classes for more than 300,000 students. But the two sides reached a compromise just before midnight, capping nearly two years of negotiations about issues ranging from pay and benefits to class sizes, special education, teacher evaluations, layoffs and charter schools.” The proposed deal will also give teachers a cumulative 4.5 percent cost of living raise by 2019 (though none this year or next). The agreement could be finalized in less than three weeks, Chicago Teachers Union Vice President Jesse Sharkey told Morning Shift. It must be ratified by the union’s House of Delegates, Chicago’s Board of Education and CTU’s rank-and-file members. Sharkey said he’s “not particularly happy to have a zero [cost-of-living adjustment] when people in the private sector are doing much better.” Still, he acknowledged the district’s financial difficulties and called the deal “fair.” In a press release Tuesday, American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten touted a “a much-deserved raise” for Chicago teachers. She also took a swipe at Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner — who’s squared off against unions — saying the negotiations were more difficult because of the state’s “toxic and austere environment.” More from the Washington Post. DWINDLING DETENTION FUNDS: The Wall Street Journal’s Devlin Barrett reports: “The Department of Homeland Security is a month away from running out of money to detain illegal immigrants … If they don’t get more money by early November, officials will be forced to stop holding newly captured illegal immigrants, including high-priority arrests at the border, the officials said.” “DHS officials now see an immediate $136 million shortfall to pay for detention beds and nondetention monitoring of illegal immigration ... ICE officials attribute the budget crunch in part to an influx of Haitian immigrants entering along the U.S. border with Mexico.” More from the Wall Street Journal here. HARVARD: THE STRIKE GOES ON: Cafeteria workers at the richest university in the world today reach their eighth day of striking over wages and benefits. The protest Tuesday included a visit from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who before she joined the Senate was a Harvard Law professor, and Ben Stiller. The New York Times reports that there’s little chance the strike will end soon. Marilyn Hausammann, Harvard’s vice president for human resources, said Tuesday that the union had refused to engage in “any meaningful dialogue” to end it. Meanwhile, food is being dished out by dining services managers and overtime-exempt university employees such as freshman proctors. UNITE HERE Local 26, which represents the 750 cafeteria workers, is demanding more affordable health care and a minimum salary of $35,000. Read more here. REHEARING SET FOR LGBT DISCRIMINATION CASE: A Chicago federal appeals court agreed Tuesday to reconsider whether Title VII of the Civil Rights Act outlaws discrimination based on sexual orientation. A hearing date for the case has been set for Nov. 30. BuzzFeed’s Chris Geidner writes that it will be the first time since the Supreme Court’s marriage equality ruling in June 2015 that a full federal appeals court will consider the issue en banc, which means the full-judge panel will be free to overrule prior decisions of the court. There may be ramifications for cases involving access to bathrooms for transgender employees. “Note that this issue is separate but related to the series of cases asking a similar question as to whether gender identity-based discrimination against transgender people also is banned under sex discrimination provisions in existing civil rights laws,” Geidner explains. Read more on Buzzfeed. ALJ: TRIBE MUST BARGAIN OVER BONUSES: A National Labor Relations Board administrative law judge ruled Tuesday that that the Viejas Band of Kumeyaay Indians, who own and operate the Viejas Casino & Resort, violated federal labor law when it paid higher annual bonuses to non-union members than to its unionized workforce. In 2015 the casino had a particularly profitable year, and the tribe was able to pay employees bonuses. The casino’s general manager asserted that because union members (about 490 food and beverage employees at the casino) had recently negotiated a significant raise, “equity demanded” that non-union members get higher bonuses. The NLRB’s general counsel argued that this arrangement violated the National Labor Relations Act in two ways: 1.) The higher nonunion bonuses discouraged union membership; 2.) The tribe did not bargain with the union before it issued the bonuses. The ALJ ruled the first argument meritless because there was no evidence of an anti-union motive. But the ALJ accepted the second argument on the grounds that informing the union of the changes to the bonuses mere moments before announcing them to all employees did not constitute a negotiation. The tribe also argued that it should be excluded from NLRB jurisdiction on sovereignty grounds, but the ALJ disagreed, writing that the board had asserted jurisdiction over tribal-owned casinos repeatedly in the past and that there was “no factual basis for reaching a different conclusion here.” The full decision is here. ARPAIO FACES CONTEMPT CHARGE: The U.S. Department of Justice plans to charge Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio with criminal contempt, the Associated Press reported Tuesday. The charge stems from Arpaio “defying a judge's orders to end his signature immigration patrols in Arizona.” The 84-year-old sheriff — a close Republican ally of Donald Trump who gave a speech praising the presidential nominee at July’s Republican National Convention — could face six months in jail if convicted. Arpaio is in the midst of a reelection campaign against Democrat Paul Penzone (whom Arpaio bested with a little more than 50 percent of the vote in 2012). The prosecution is the latest turn in a legal saga that began in 2007 with racial profiling complaints against Arpaio, known nationally for his hard-line stance against immigration. After years of litigation, U.S. District Court Judge G. Murray Snow ruled in 2013 that Arpaio had violated the constitutional rights of Latinos during traffic stops and raids. A civil contempt charge followed in May of this year when Arpaio didn’t comply with the judge’s orders. “While Arpaio and his cohorts admitted violating three of Snow’s orders, they insisted the missteps were unintentional. By law, intent could mean the difference between civil and criminal contempt,” the Arizona Republic reports. “Snow found cause for both.” More from the Arizona Republic here. AIRLINES AND ORGANIZED LABOR: A ProPublica investigation published Tuesday looked at the role of organized labor during the 2013 merger of U.S. Airways and American Airlines — a move opposed by the Justice Department. Justin Elliott reports: “Organized labor often opposes mergers because the ‘efficiencies’ touted by Wall Street can be a euphemism for job cuts. But in this case, US Airways executives won the backing of the American Airlines pilot, flight attendant, and mechanics’ unions in exchange for promises of better contracts.” “Flight attendants union chief Laura Glading was the most active labor figure campaigning for the deal, crisscrossing the country to meet with editorial boards and state attorneys general who had joined DOJ’s suit.,” Elliot writes. “Appearing at a Capitol Hill rally in her flight attendant uniform, she offered a different perspective and image than the company executives in business suits. Hilary Rosen, one of the Democratic lobbyists working on the deal, later credited the union support with flipping the Justice Department.” More here. POLK COUNTY RAISES MINIMUM WAGE: The Board of Supervisors in Polk County, Iowa, voted Tuesday to raise the hourly minimum wage to $10.75, up from the current $7.25. Under the proposal, the county’s hourly minimum will rise to $8.75 in April 2017; $9.75 in January 2018, and $10.75 in January 2019. It’s the fourth Iowa county to raise its minimum above the federal minimum. More from WQAD. CASE OF THE MUNCHIES: A Nevada union representing culinary workers announced Monday that it will support a state ballot initiative to legalize recreational marijuana use by adults. Via the Las Vegas Sun: “Culinary Workers Union Local 226, which represents more than 57,000 workers statewide, endorsed the initiative on the basis of taking marijuana out of the black market into tax-paying businesses.” Of course, legal cannabis and cooking can go hand-in-hand, too. By one estimate, marijuana-infused edibles make up roughly half of the $5.4 billion industry. Read more here. DID WARM WINTER SHRINK MAY JOB GROWTH?: When the Labor Department reported that the economy added a mere 38,000 jobs in May (later revised down to 24,000), politicians and economists wondered briefly whether the U.S. economy was in trouble. But an unusually warm winter may account for that dramatic dip, according to a study from San Francisco Fed researchers. The Wall Street Journal’s Eric Morath reports: “Researchers say weather — specifically unseasonably warm winter temperatures — were largely responsible for the surprise figure. When adjusting for weather effects, U.S. employers added 162,000 jobs in May, rather than the 24,000 estimated by the Labor Department, according the report.

Amazon is planning a line of tiny grocery stores Quartz 10/12/2016 Alison Griswold © Provided by Quartz Amazon workers deliver groceries from the Amazon Fresh service in Brooklyn. Grocery delivery is the holy grail of online shopping. Everyone is chasing it—startups like Instacart, traditional retailers like Walmart, and of course e-commerce giant Amazon—but so far no winner has emerged. Amazon has worked on its grocery delivery service, Amazon Fresh, since 2007. Fresh is a competitor to services like Peapod and FreshDirect, which allow customers to place their orders online and have them dropped off at home. Until recently, Amazon Fresh cost $299 a year, but last week it was rebranded as a $15-a-month add-on to Amazon Prime. Quotes in the article Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 739.01 -3.37 -0.45% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 71.23 -0.16 -0.22% Turns out that was only the beginning of the changes in store for Amazon Fresh. Today the Wall Street Journal reports that Amazon is planning a line of tiny grocery shops for Fresh customers, internally dubbed “Project Como.” From the Journal: The Seattle company aims to build small brick-and-mortar stores that would sell produce, milk, meats and other perishable items that customers can take home, these people say. Primarily using their mobile phones or, possibly, touch screens around the store, customers could also order peanut butter, cereal and other goods with longer shelf lives for same-day delivery. A spokeswoman for Amazon said in an email that the company doesn’t comment “on rumors or speculation.” According to the Journal, Amazon will also build designated drive-in pick-up spots for consumers who want to place grocery orders online and have them brought to the car, a move rumored earlier this summer. The online retailer would be following in the footsteps of Walmart, which offers free, same-day curbside grocery pick-up at around 400 locations in the US. The system takes advantage of Walmart’s extensive network of nearly 4,000 US stores, which are already equipped with freezers, fridges, and other things needed to store and distribute fresh food. “Walmart has built probably the world’s best fresh supply chain,” Ravi Jariwala, a company spokesman, told Quartz in August. Online retailers believe that grocery sales are important because everyone needs to buy food. In 2015, the average US consumer went to the grocery store 1.5 times a week. That might not be frequent enough to sustain an entire business (see: Instacart), but it can be a powerful driver of sales for more general businesses. Before Jet.com was purchased for $3.3 billion in August by Walmart, the e-commerce startup said customers who bought groceries were doing so 2.4 times per month, compared to the average customer who made only 1.5 purchases a month.

The Herald Times reports that Saulter admitted making the $620 in purchases at Walmart, Kroger and Marsh, but told a police detective he "accidentally" used the office credit card instead of his personal debit card because he was under a lot of personal stress at the time and the cards were similar in appearance. The suspicious purchases were made between September 5 and October 10 of last year. Police documented 13 transactions at various Kroger stores in Bloomington, two at Walmart and two at a Marsh store. "All of the transactions were caught on video and all of them showed suspect Saulter using the credit card to purchase prescription medications and food for his personal use," the affidavit reads. Saulter's wife had been ill, and she died on February 14 of this year. Lt. Shawn Karr, a detective with the Monroe County Sheriff's Office, compared Saulter's debit card with the county-issued card, and they were "partly the same color," he wrote in a probable-cause affidavit filed in Monroe Circuit Court, but had distinct differences. Attorney Stanley Levco from Evansville, appointed a special prosecutor in the case, filed three counts of fraud and one count of official misconduct. They are Level 6 felonies that carry a possible jail term of six months to 21/2 years and a $10,000 fine. Saulter, 64, was issued a summons to appear in court for an initial hearing on October 25. Saulter had been the county auditor for 7.5 years, then resigned in July as a special prosecutor's investigation continued.

REUTERS Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email Trump, unchained Donald Trump says he is now campaigning as a candidate who is unchained. He greeted more than 10,000 in Panama City last night, but said nothing about House Speaker Paul Ryan or other prominent Republicans who have distanced themselves from him. Instead, Trump mused repeatedly about the possibility of losing. Clinton gains A new poll shows Donald Trump recovering some losses after his performance in the second presidential debate. More Republican voters are also saying party lawmakers should keep backing the brash business tycoon’s bid to win the White House, but the overall news from the poll wasn’t necessarily good for the GOP nominee. Clinton camp emails Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, has said there was a “reasonable” chance that Donald Trump’s campaign had “advanced warning” about the latest Wikileaks hack that exposed thousands of Podesta’s emails. Podesta says a close Trump adviser suggested as much himself. Looming battle U.S. commanders who served in Mosul a decade ago are back, preparing Iraq’s own soldiers to retake the city from ISIS. Unlike on earlier tours, the commanders tell CBS News American troops are only there this time to train and advise -- not for combat, and they’re facing a weary enemy. But U.S. forces are out there, and there’s little safety in Iraq. Speaking out Hours after the notorious Trump tape hit the airwaves, author Kelly Oxford launched a Twitter appeal, sharing her own story of sexual assault and asking other women to join her. The response was explosive, offering a window into the scope of the problem in the country today. In light of the national discussion, Anita Hill tells us what she believes must happen next.

New data from federal regulators shows a 10 percent increase last year in teen driving deaths. We look at the top mistakes teens are making behind the wheel. Remain seated The country’s largest grocer is adding curbside pickup to its online ordering service. The idea is simple: Order groceries through Walmart’s grocery app or on its website, drive to your local Walmart and employees will deliver them to your car, free. But Walmart faces a lot of hurdles -- and some hungry rivals planning similar services. Gas tax hike New Jersey will become the 19th state in three years to raise or reform its gasoline tax if, as expected, Republican Gov. Chris Christie signs off on the just-approved 23-cent hike.

Wal-Mart raised salaries from $47,476 to $48,500 annually for employees including store management, spokesman Randy Hargrove said on Tuesday. The retailer did not break out the number of employees who received the raise. The new Obama administration rule, set to take effect Dec. 1, will require employers to pay overtime to salaried workers earning less than $47,500 a year, double the current threshold of $23,660. "We think the starting rate of $48,500 a year ... would make a lot of business sense for our company," Hargrove said. Wal-Mart is the largest private employer in the United States and employs 1.5 million workers, which includes store staff, store management and truck drivers. The managerial raises went into effect in September when Wal-Mart paid more than $201 million in second-quarter bonuses to hourly store staff as 99 percent of its stores met targets for cleanliness, faster checkout and better service. Earlier this year, Wal-Mart increased entry level wages to $10 an hour and in December 2015 said it would invest $2.7 billion in employee compensation and training over two years. These increases come at a time when the retailer is cutting back-office jobs and announced the elimination of about 7,000 positions, mostly in accounting and invoicing at its U.S. stores. The new overtime rule is likely to touch nearly every sector of the U.S. economy, with the biggest impact on retail, hospitality and restaurants. Last month, officials from 21 U.S. states filed a lawsuit claiming the new overtime rule will place a heavy burden on state budgets. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business groups also filed a separate challenge to the rule in the same federal court. Business groups have said the rule will force employers to demote some salaried management workers to hourly positions and create more part-time jobs that do not offer benefits. Only 7 percent of full-time salaried employees are currently eligible for overtime pay down from 62 percent in 1975, according to the Department of Labor.

Rankin PORTSMOUTH, Va. – Former Portsmouth Police Officer Stephen Rankin was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for voluntary manslaughter Wednesday morning. Court started at 9 a.m. The judge denied Rankin bond and ordered him to be locked up immediately after the sentencing. Rankin’s lawyers say they will file an appeal, but they can’t do that until after the formal sentencing. When he was found guilty on August 4, the jury recommended 2 and a half years, however, the judge will make the final determination. There will likely be impact statements made before sentencing. Rankin shot and killed 18-year-old William Chapman II during an incident that occurred around 7:35 a.m. on April 22, 2015 in the parking lot of the Walmart located at 1098 Frederick Blvd. in Portsmouth. Click here for all of our coverage on Chapman's death and Rankin's trial Portsmouth Police were alerted by Walmart security about a suspected shoplifter. Chapman was spotted crossing the parking lot on foot and was approached by Rankin. During the encounter, a struggle ensued that resulted in Chapman being shot by the police officer. The officer immediately requested medics. Chapman died at the scene. Chapman's body was sent to the Office of the Medical Examiner in Norfolk for examination and autopsy. Virginia State Police took the lead role in the investigation. They were asked to investigate the case by Former Portsmouth Police Chief Ed Hargis because it is the second officer-involved shooting in Portsmouth within the last month. The day after the shooting Candy Chapman, Williams’s mother spoke out about her son’s death and made an emotional statement to the public. “That’s my son, I have to speak for him. I have to be his voice. He didn’t deserve this,” says Candy Chapman. “I called 911 myself after I found out it was a boy that was 18. I have not seen my son for hours. I told them my son’s name, detectives came and told me yes, it was your son, and that was about seven something in the morning.” During the press conference in April of 2015, she smiled and recalled happy memories of her son about how he loved the library and books. She described him as a compassionate person who was soft spoken and stayed out of trouble. She says she can’t believe he’d charge at an officer the way that eye witnesses described. “If he was struggling with the officer, it’s because he was afraid. That’s the only reason. Not because he wanted to harm the officer or get some type of attention.” She said she has four other children and William was her oldest son. In August 2015, the Commonwealth's Attorney announced that they had completed their investigation into the shooting death of Chapman and announced that officials were seeking an indictment against Rankin. On September 3, 2015 Rankin was indicted on charges of first degree murder and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony by a grand jury. He was then fired by the city. A jury found Rankin guilty of voluntary manslaughter in August 2015. “People were convinced that he some kind of racist murdering monster that just wants to go out and kill people,” said Dawn Rankin, Stephen’s wife. Immediately after the shooting Dawn said threats began her family and her loved ones. “The day of the indictment came down we had to leave our home and we never lived in again,” said Dawn Rankin “People would gather outside of our house with the media knocking on the door.” He is scheduled to be sentenced October 12th. “There was almost a mob mentality of a rush to judgment,” said Dawn Rankin, “Obviously, we have to have a conversation about this because what's going on in the country just isn't okay, and so we need to have this conversation. People need to hear what this is like.” Please enable Javascript to watch this video Filed in: News Topics: portsmouth, Stephen Rankin, William Chapman Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email Southern Bank News 3’s Proud Community Partner!

Amazon is developing license-plate reading technology to reduce wait times. Amazon recently changed Fresh from a $299 per year service to a $15-a-month add-on to Amazon Prime. It's available in Seattle, Northern California, Southern California, New York, and Philadelphia areas. Walmart has begun testing grocery pickup, along with other retailers like Kroger and Giant. Walmart has taken its pickup service from five markets to more than 80 nationally in the past year, according to the Washington Post. "We see a huge opportunity through pickup, particularly in grocery," Doug McMillon, Walmart's chief executive, told investors last year.

Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 71.23 -0.16 -0.22% Wal-Mart raised salaries from $47,476 to $48,500 annually for employees including store management, spokesman Randy Hargrove said on Tuesday. The retailer did not break out the number of employees who received the raise. The new Obama administration rule, set to take effect Dec. 1, will require employers to pay overtime to salaried workers earning less than $47,500 a year, double the current threshold of $23,660. "We think the starting rate of $48,500 a year ... would make a lot of business sense for our company," Hargrove said. Wal-Mart is the largest private employer in the United States and employs 1.5 million workers, which includes store staff, store management and truck drivers. The managerial raises went into effect in September when Wal-Mart paid more than $201 million in second-quarter bonuses to hourly store staff as 99 percent of its stores met targets for cleanliness, faster checkout and better service.© REUTERS/Daniel Becerril General view shows a Wal-Mart store in Monterrey Earlier this year, Wal-Mart increased entry level wages to $10 an hour and in December 2015 said it would invest $2.7 billion in employee compensation and training over two years. These increases come at a time when the retailer is cutting back-office jobs and announced the elimination of about 7,000 positions, mostly in accounting and invoicing at its U.S. stores. The new overtime rule is likely to touch nearly every sector of the U.S. economy, with the biggest impact on retail, hospitality and restaurants. Last month, officials from 21 U.S. states filed a lawsuit claiming the new overtime rule will place a heavy burden on state budgets. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business groups also filed a separate challenge to the rule in the same federal court. Business groups have said the rule will force employers to demote some salaried management workers to hourly positions and create more part-time jobs that do not offer benefits. Only 7 percent of full-time salaried employees are currently eligible for overtime pay down from 62 percent in 1975, according to the Department of Labor.

News Isle Of Wight County Plastics company among top prospects for industrial park Hillary Smithhismith@dailypress.com Privacy Policy A company that manufactures large plastic storage bins for Wal-Mart and Target may be an answer to Isle of Wight County's quest to fill Shirley T. Holland Intermodal Park to reduce water costs. Tom Elder, the county's director of economic development, told the Economic Development Authority Tuesday that the plastic manufacturing company was the most promising of the four meetings he had on a recent trip to Chicago, where he met with potential business prospects for the park. The plastics company said it would send representatives to visit Isle of Wight within the next couple of months, Elder said. "That's the most you can hope for, when you go on trips like this — to have them take a look at your assets," Elder said. "That's what you're looking for." Elder didn't name any of the companies he met with. The plastics company is seeking a 100,000- to 120,000-square-foot space and would need 35 to 50 employees. The company would like to have a place secured soon, but Elder doesn't yet have a timeline for when the company would give an answer. In June, the county hired Camoin Associates, an economic development firm, to locate companies that use a substantial amount of water. The goal was to alleviate the county's bill for its 2009 water deal with Suffolk and Norfolk. Camoin zeroed in on California and Illinois to source prospects. Caption W.M. Jordan CEO John Lawson W.M.

Social media makes news accessible to its users, but also exposes them to false information. In Chicago, Elder said, he also met with a high-quality milk manufacturer that is mainly considering Pennsylvania as a location, and a dairy factory that works with glass bottles. The bottle factory has about 11,000 customers in Hampton Roads, but is looking to acquire more space in the next four or five years, Elder said. He also mentioned one meeting with a truck parts company that isn't yet completely set on having an East Coast location. The department also had two visits in the last month, one by a tire manufacturer and one by a Spanish ham company, Elder said. The tire manufacturer visited the county Sept. 21, and is looking for a million square feet of space. It would employ 500 people, and invest more than $500 million. The company is touring sites in Virginia and other states, and will provide the county with a short list of sites in which it's interested, Elder said. There is no current time estimate for the list.

(Reema Amin) The Spanish ham processor visited the county on Oct. 7, and is hoping to build a 65,000-square-foot facility that can expand to 133,000 square feet. The company would bring about 20 new jobs and use 130,000 to 140,000 gallons of water per day, Elder said. The project would be a roughly $25 million capital investment. There is no estimate for when the companies will decide whether to open facilities in the area, Elder said. He is planning a trip to southern California for February 2017 to meet with more potential tenants of the park. Smith can be reached by phone at 757-510-1663.

The new owner, Bemberg Center Partners, LLC, has a listed address of 2926 Foster Creighton Drive, Nashville. Jon Hartman, director of planning and economic development for Elizabethton, said he first became aware there was an interest in purchasing the building when he was in Nashville for an International Council of Shopping Centers idea exchange. In a memorandum to Elizabethton City Manager Jerome Kitchens and Carter County Tomorrow Chairman Richard Tester, Hartman said, “I met with some brokers who had a client interested interested in purchasing the Magic Mart Building.” Since the meeting with Hartman, the building was sold to Bemberg Center Partners by former owner IQ14-Elizabethton Kenosa LLC on July 13. After the purchase, Hartman said he has had many discussions on making improvements to the building and potential retailers who might locate in the building after renovation. While retailers often see Elizabethton as part of Johnson City’s sphere of influence, Hartman said Monday that Elizabethton has its own area of retail influence, which he said includes Carter County, Johnson County and portions of Western North Carolina. While this footprint will help in attracting the attention of a few potential investors, Hartman said some commercial incentives would likely be in order to get the retailers to make an investment and improvements to the site and surrounding area. The purchased property includes 10.41 acres of land. The building contains 100,348 square feet and was built in 1988. The parking lot was last paved in 2001.

Sports Photos Faces in Places Arts Around The Area People In Society Spotlight on Wicomico Social Lounge Berlin Monitoring Service Road Process Oct 13,2016 by Charlene Sharpe BERLIN – As development along Route 50 increases, Berlin officials made it clear this week they would be watching traffic at the highway’s intersection with Seahawk Road closely. During a meeting of the Berlin Town Council, Mayor Gee Williams said the town would continue to urge county officials to avoid having the Route 50 service road, Samuel Bowen Boulevard, meet Seahawk Road. “We’re all hoping the westernmost access to that service road will be directly on Route 50,” Williams said. The discussion arose after Dave Engelhart, the town’s planning director, advised the council he was attending the monthly meetings of the Worcester County Design Guidelines and Route 50 Transportation Corridor Plan Task Force. Lately the task force has been discussing plans for the service road, which at one time was expected to run from the area of Walmart to Seahawk Road. “They’re still talking about where it should go, how it should end, how it should hook up into Route 50,” Engelhart said. He said the original plans for the road were seven or eight years old. “It appears it’s going to change from that alignment,” he said. Williams said he hoped the task force was considering all the changes that had occurred along that portion of Route 50 in recent years. The area near Seahawk Road in particular has seen significant development, as a new Royal Farms and Arby’s are under construction and the Oceans East apartment complex is set to be built in the near future. Williams indicated that Seahawk Road, already home to two busy schools in addition to the coming apartment complex, would not be the best place for Samuel Bowen Boulevard to end. “Seahawk Road is not the appropriate endpoint,” he said. Councilmember Lisa Hall agreed. “There’s too much going on at the intersection right now,” she said. “Royal Farms is getting ready to open, Arby’s business is going to increase. That intersection is overwhelmed as it is.” She added that she thought Maryland’s State Highway Administration should consider installing a rundown crosswalk on Route 50 in front of Royal Farms. “You’re not going to keep those kids from going there from the high school,” Hall said. Engelhart assured the council he would continue to attend the county’s monthly meetings and would keep them advised of news on the service road. “I think it’s going to be a long process,” he said. ← Previous Next → 0 shares About The Author: Charlene Sharpe Charlene Sharpe has been with The Dispatch since 2014.

Police report that Patrolman Daniel Salvati stopped a Jeep Cherokee for speeding 87 mph in a 65-mph zone and identified the operator as a 30-year-old Paterson man. Through their investigation, police learned that the man was named in an arrest warrant out of Clifton, said Lt. James MacIntosh. He posted bail on the warrant prior to his release, MacIntosh said. Energy drink theft leads to chase Police charged a Delaware man with resisting arrest after allegedly trying to dash away from the Walmart store with 13 cases of the Red Bull energy drink on the night of Oct. 9. "The suspect was seen loading up a cart and walking around the registers and heading toward the doors," said Lt. James MacIntosh in a press release. "When the suspect saw the police vehicle, he pushed the cart into the vehicle and attempted to run." The value of the energy drink was $243.49. After a brief foot chase, Patrolman Andrew Duffy was able to catch 41-year-old Michael Betts of Bear, Del. Once police realized Betts had driven to the store, they searched his vehicle, finding a bundle of wax folds believed to contain heroin in plain view on the front seat. Police also discovered two pipes, a small bag of "crack" cocaine, a jar of marijuana, 11 hypodermic needles, and more than 100 empty folds of heroin, MacIntosh said. Betts was charged with possession of heroin and crack cocaine (third-degree crimes); shoplifting and resisting arrest (fourth--degree crimes); and possession of hypodermic needles and drug paraphernalia (disorderly person offenses). Betts was also issued summonses for driving while suspended and parking in a handicapped zone. He was released with an October date at Morris County Central Judicial Processing. Shoplifting report A 28-year-old Bloomingdale man was charged with shoplifting on Oct. 10 from The Home Depot, where he allegedly tried to steal seven automatic sprinklers. According to police, Sgt. Patrick Harden responded to the Route 23 store at about 11:40 a.m. for the attempted shoplifting of sprinklers totaling $57.53. Joseph Westphal was charged with shoplifting, as a disorderly person offense. He was released with a Municipal Court appearance in October. Man accused of inhaling cleaner On the afternoon of Oct. 10, Sgt. Patrick Harden responded to The Home Depot for a man observed shoplifting and inhaling cans of "Dust Off" cleaner, authorities said. The suspect, Richard Flood, 44, of Greenwood Lake, N.Y., allegedly had been coming in and out of the store and taking cans., According to Lt. James MacIntosh, store employees saw Flood inhaling from the cans while walking out of the store to his vehicle. A total of three cans of cleaner were found in Flood's possession valued at about $20. Sgt. Harden took Flood into custody, and a search allegedly revealed that the suspect had a Suboxone pill in his possession without a prescription. Flood was charged with possession of a controlled dangerous substance (a third- degree crime). He was also accused of possessing and inhaling toxic chemicals, as well as shoplifting, both disorderly person offenses. Released from custody, he has an October date in Morris County Central Judicial Processing. "Police news" is compiled by Suburban Trends from information provided by the police department.

We tend to think that some of the outrage gets a trifle overdone. Other people irked by some of the dress-up clothes mass manufactured for Oct. 31 have a point. Sometimes things that were once considered OK by the masses aren’t any longer. We imagine that many a child of yesteryear dressed up as an “Indian” for example — something that has since fallen clearly (and justifiably) under the heading of cultural insensitivity. Then there was the ill-considered “Tranny Granny” costume that’s been pulled this year already from Amazon and Wal Mart, for obvious reasons. Having seen pictures, we can’t imagine this would have been a great seller anyway, quite aside from its perpetuation of outdated gender stereotypes. And speaking of outdated gender stereotypes, past years have, also justifiably, seen parents of little girls upset by a couple of legitimate issues. These are, one, a lack of superhero costumes for girls, and two, a plethora of really inappropriately suggestive get-ups. On the first, why shouldn’t a girl get to be a superhero if she wants to? She shouldn’t have to be relegated to the sidekick role. There’s plenty of little girls who will want to be princesses for Halloween, but for those who want to be Spiderman, or Superman or Batman, it should at least be an option. On the second, who wants to send their seven-year-old out in fishnets, or a naughty maid costume? And yet, these are actually sold for young girls. It’s not cute, it’s just really uncomfortable. Let’s stick with age-appropriate. But by far the worst thing we’ve seen so far this month is the press release from Children of the Street Society, begging parents not to send their children out trick-or-treating as a pimp or a ho. It’s horrifying that there are enough parents encouraging and/or allowing this that such an organization felt the need to send out a media release. What parent thinks it would be fun to send their kid out dressed as someone in the sex trade? It’s not funny or clever or edgy. It’s just sad. And beyond bad taste. -Black Press We encourage an open exchange of ideas on this story's topic, but we ask you to follow our guidelines for respecting community standards.

Oxendine, who runs the family business of Red-Line Chemical in Rock Hill, is leading a supply drive today and Friday to help those affected by the sudden floodings caused in Robeson County by Hurricane Matthew. Oxendine moved away from Lumberton in 1972, but is now hoping to give back and help those who are in need, especially the nearly 60,000 members of the Lumbee Tribe who live in the area. There’s quite a number of folks without basic needs now. Dave Oxendine “That’s where our family is,” said Oxendine. “I don’t know how many first cousins I have, but there’s quite a number of folks without basic needs now.” Red-Line will have a delivery truck at the Wal-Mart parking lot on Dave Lyle Boulevard from 9 a.m.-11 a.m. Friday. They were organizing donations from 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Thursday. The company is seeking to fill up a moving truck that’s 20 feet by 8 feet with enough donations to put displaced flooding victims back on their feet, with plentiful food and dry clothes. Sheila Oxendine, Dave’s sister-in-law, came in on her day off from work to help fold clothes. “I wouldn’t be any other place but here,” she said. “We’re blessed to be where we’re at right now, with so many people that are struggling. I feel it in my heart that we need to give back.” Oxendine says he has plenty of family and close friends from the Lumbee tribe who still live in the area. As of Thursday morning, he says the county has seen up to 22 inches of standing water. The donations truck will be back in the Wal-Mart parking lot from 9 a.m.-11 a.m. Friday. The water levels are expected to rise again this weekend, he said, which may hamper the help from search-and-rescue teams hoping to extricate people from their cars or homes. Dave’s mother, Maggie, has had sporadic contact with her oldest sister since the hurricane. She said it will feel “wonderful” for victims to move back into their old lives after being displaced. “I really hope so,” she said. “I don’t know what they’re all going back to.” By mid-afternoon Thursday, the truck had seen tens of potential donors who helped by picking up extra supplies at the Wal-Mart before passing it on to Oxendine. I don’t know what they’re all going back to. Maggie Oxendine Once they finish the drive Friday afternoon, the items will be transported to the Baptist Mission Camps in Red Springs, N.C. for redistribution on Friday. Oxendine said the instinct to help was immediate. “It’s family, number one,” he said. “But it’s also people in need. So anytime you can help out people, something we like to do, it means more.” David Thackham: 803-329-4066, @dthackham Want to help? Red-Line is requesting that donations include: air mattresses, baby items (diapers, formula, baby food), bottled water, boxed juices, first aid kits, flashlights, all hygiene items (male and female), latex gloves, paper towels, clothing (new or gently used), pet food for cats and dogs, towels/wash cloths, blankets, pillows, undergarments (new), wet wipes, snack foods, toys and small activities for families/kids while displaced. Monetary donations can be made to Burnt Swamp Association (Hurricane Matthew Flood Victims) PO Box 1207 Pembroke, NC 28372 or on their website at www.burntswamp.org.

A recent study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) forecasts that the 2016 holiday shopping season will be the best that retailers have seen in many years. Similarly, retail trade groups such as the National Retail Federation (NRF) remain positive about the potential of this year's consumer holiday spending. The NRF predicts that holiday sales for 2016 are expected to reach $655.8 billion, a 3.6% increase over last year, which far outpaces the 7-year average of 3.4% since the economy started to recover from the recession in 2009. An all-time high amount is also expected to be seen in this year's Halloween spending, which is estimated at $8.4 billion, according to NRF's annual survey conducted by Prosper Insights. According to PWC, a number of factors are at play in the increased expected holiday spending: including the rise of the millennial shopper, increased mobile orders and a generally more healthy economy. So with that expected bump in holiday sales, retailers of all shapes and sizes are gearing up and hiring large amounts of seasonal holiday workers. Amazon.com (AMZN) became the latest to do so, announcing Thursday that it plans to hire 20% more seasonal workers for its U.S. warehouses this holiday season as some competitors have kept hiring steady. Macy's  (M) , Target  (TGT) , Costco Wholesale  (COST)  and WalMart  (WMT) will also bring on swaths of seasonal workers. "Consumers have seen steady job and income gains throughout the year, resulting in continued confidence and the greater use of credit, which bodes well for more spending throughout the holiday season," said Jack Kleinhenz, NRF Chief Economist. "Shoppers told us they plan to spend 10% more this holiday season; an average of $1,121 each. And consumers with annual household incomes less than $50,000 will increase their percentage spending levels even more than consumers overall," wrote PwC in a report released Oct. 4. "Hipsters-upwardly mobile, college-educated millennials in enclaves such as Austin, Brooklyn, Oakland, and Portland-will spend $500 more this season than consumers overall." The kicker, "hipsters" will spend about 33% of their budget on themselves, according to PwC. Big retailers eager to lock in temporary holiday workers have started recruitment as early as October. According to NRF, retailers are expected to hire between 640,000 and 690,000 seasonal workers this holiday season, in line with last year's 675,300 new holiday positions. Macy's announced their plan to hire 83,000 employees back in September, an increase of 3,000 jobs compared to last year. Target is looking to hire an additional 70,000 seasonal team members across the country and 7,500 team members for their distribution and fulfillment facilities. Toys 'R' Us, while refusing to disclose a national figure, said it will hire tens of thousands of seasonal team members to staff their stores and distribution centers across the country. While companies are looking to hire, its not always easy to find employees to work the holiday season especially if there is competition for these employees. Some, including Toys 'R' Us and Yankee Candle, are offering seasonal employees perks such as higher pay, bigger merchandise discounts, more flexible hours and access to online schedule systems. Some have even broadened the pool to include people with criminal backgrounds. "People that are searching for jobs during the holiday season should be aware that so many of these jobs are actually in the back room. Order fulfillment, processing, transportation, it's not only customer service but also people that are good with operation and very organized," said Andrew Challenger, vice president at Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a Chicago-based outplacement consulting company. Finding the right staff to handle the significant volume and customer interaction during the holiday shopping season is especially important. "One piece of advice I can give to every retailer out there is to communicate as much as you can across the departments so that everyone understand what is going on, so that everyone is well prepared to serve the customer," said Kevon Hills, vice president of research at StellaService, a customer service analytics company. While the general positive outlook for the all-important holiday shopping season signals a return of consumer confidence in the American economy, brick-and-mortar retailers face challenges and competitions posed by their e-commerce counterparts, in particular, the one-stop online shop for everything from TV sets to baby diapers - Amazon.com. For customers who value convenience, price, speed and variety at their fingertips, other fast-growing e-commerce sites such as Wal-Mart's Jet.com also present a challenge to the rosy expectations of retail merchants. Still, there are risks that may present themselves between now and the holiday season. "Increased geopolitical uncertainty, the presidential election outcome and unseasonably warm weather are the main issues at play with the greatest potential to shake consumer confidence and impact shopping patterns," Kleinhenz, the NRF Chief Economist, said.  Costco is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio.

It happened around 6:45 p.m. Officers arrived and say one of the suspects shot a gun at officers.  Police say 18-year-old Bobby Lannell Hargrove, one of the two robbery suspects, was injured during an exchange of gunfire with officer Kendrick Williams. Hargrove was taken to Carolinas Medical Center to be treated for his injuries. After being cleared by medical staff, Hargrove was taken to police headquarters and charged with thee counts of kidnapping, robbery with a dangerous weapon, conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon and assault on a law enforcement officer with a firearm  Investigators said they are working to determine if Hargrove's injury was caused by being "grazed when the officer fired his weapon or in a different manner." No other injuries were reported.  SWAT was called to the scene to check inside the building for the second person, but were unable to locate him. Officers are working to get an identification on the man who escaped.  "We are in the process of looking for that subject," CMPD Deputy Chief Katrina Graue told reporters. "We’ll need to get a good description to get out to you so the public can help us find that second subject.” As per standard protocol, Williams has been placed on paid administrative leave and the incident will be investigated by the Internal Affairs Bureau. Williams has been with CMPD since January 2010. Anyone with further information is asked to call 704-432-TIPS, or Crime Stoppers at 704-334-1600. Copyright 2016 WBTV. All rights reserved.

Most Popular The true cost of Brexit hit home for U.K. shoppers as Unilever's iconic Marmite spread and a host of other products remained absent from Tesco's online store Thursday because of a standoff over price increases triggered by the Brexit vote. Marmite spread Credit: Unilever via Facebook Britain's biggest supermarket chain said Wednesday that it's "currently experiencing availability issues on a number of Unilever products," and aims to have the issue resolved soon. Unilever, which reported a decline in third-quarter sales volumes Thursday, told analysts that it was "confident" the issue would be resolved quickly, noting that the U.K. accounts for just 5% of its business. The dispute lays bare the close ties between Tesco and its third-largest supplier, which produces household brands like Hellmann's mayonnaise, Dove, and Ben & Jerry's ice cream and was Tesco Chief Executive Officer Dave Lewis's longtime employer. Unilever, along with other consumer-product makers like Nestle SA, is facing heightened sourcing costs from a plunge in the pound since the June vote to leave the European Union, yet passing those expenses along to retailers will be difficult with U.K. grocers already locked in fierce competition. "Tough price negotiations are a constant factor of the relationship between food manufacturers and retailers, and are going to be very tough in the U.K. following the Brexit vote," Andrew Wood, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said in a note. "But they rarely break out in public or lead to de-stocking of manufacturer products." Mr. Wood's note today also said Tesco likely accounts for around 1.5% of Unilever's global sales. He likened the dispute to a similar Unilever confrontation with Delhaize in Europe years ago that was resolved in a few weeks, and said it could signal more pricing skirmishes as global marketers look to compensate for the declining pound. Tesco is Unilever's third-biggest customer after Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Kroger Co., accounting for 2.3% of its revenue, according to Bloomberg data. The Guardian newspaper has reported that Unilever wants to raise prices by about 10% because of the fall in sterling. Among Unilever's brands to exit the Tesco web store were Persil detergent, Flora margarine and more than 100 products in the Dove range of body care. A check of Tesco.com Thursday morning showed the products were still unavailable. "Retailers' margins are already squeezed," Justin King, former CEO of U.K. supermarket chain J Sainsbury, said at an event hosted by Bloomberg in London on Wednesday. "So there is no room to absorb input price pressures and costs will need to be passed on." The Brexit vote has already affected pricing of products ranging from floor coverings to toilet paper. Unilever was among companies that lobbied voters to remain in the European Union, while supermarkets including Tesco took a more neutral stance ahead of the vote in a bid not to alienate either faction of consumers. Sainsbury and Wm. Morrison Supermarkets declined to comment on their relationships with Unilever. Wal-Mart's Asda unit did not immediately respond to a request for comment. "The question is whether Sainsbury, Asda, Waitrose and others are taking it on the chin or if they will play hardball too," Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank in London, said in a note. "What about other suppliers -- Unilever is probably not a one-off trying to pass on higher input costs." Food companies such as KitKat maker Nestle and Swiss dairy concern Emmi AG have both said they will look to raise prices in the U.K. to respond to the plunge in sterling. Nestle is due to report third-quarter sales Oct. 20. "The margin in the U.K. will be lower next year than this year or last year, that's for sure," Emmi Chief Executive Officer Urs Riedener said on Oct. 6. "We're obliged to push price increases in most of the segments." Any dispute between Tesco and Unilever would be particularly touchy for Mr. Lewis, the Unilever veteran. Tesco has sought to improve relations with its vendors in the wake of an accounting scandal and criticism from a grocery industry regulator. The tussle also risks damaging Unilever's reputation as a good corporate citizen, an image that Chief Executive Officer Paul Polman has sought to enhance in recent years. "This sort of standoff benefits no one," said Bryan Roberts, an analyst at researcher TCC Global. "Unilever will lose market share by not being in Tesco, and shoppers will feel a huge degree of frustration. A speedy resolution would be in everyone's best interests." --Bloomberg News-- In this article: CMO Strategy CPG Digital Retail Become a Member Register Now Renew Membership Benefits Datacenter Advertising Age     Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Tumblr Copyright © 1994-2016 Crain Communications Privacy Statement Terms of Use About Us Advertise Reprints Contact Us AD AGE Creativity LookBook Datacenter Resources Events Jobs On Campus Site by AREA 17 x Scroll to Continue

He was letting all of us mere mortals in the general vicinity know that his work was forcing him to travel to “one of those square states where the square people live.” In my overactive imagination, that anonymous Brit could be related to English director Andrea Arnold. Her celebrated, Cannes Film Festival-honored American Honey, the alternately mesmerizing and maddening, nearly three-hour, teenage fever dream of a film about a road trip across the heartland, bears a similar zoo-animal curiosity and repulsion with flyover country and Wal-Mart America. But, even at its most obvious and ham-fisted, American Honey remains compelling, largely for Arnold’s vividly verité, documentary-like cinematic style and a career-launching performance by Texan Sasha Lane who has never acted in a film before this. She’s absolutely magnetic as a young Oklahoma woman looking to burst free from her humdrum life of dumpster diving and shepherding her younger step-siblings, all the while fighting off advances from her vile, grabby stepdad. So it’s easy to see why she says yes to carefree Jake (Shia LaBeouf, with a gnarly, rat-tail haircut) on his invitation to join his ragtag group of street kids who caravan across the country, ostensibly selling magazine subscriptions door to door. But their commitment to literacy is outweighed by their love of freedom, hip-hop, and Rihanna’s We Found Love. The latter — with its lyrics of finding love “in a hopeless place” and played here over a big-box store sound system while Jake dances on a checkout counter to Star’s growing admiration — represents everything that’s both right and wrong with American Honey. On the one hand, “small-town Oklahoma” plus “big-box store” equals “hopeless place” is just too easy an equation. On the other hand, the scene itself is sweetly and wonderfully euphoric. Lending what little tension there is to this freewheeling cross-country foray is Krystal (a suitably tough Riley Keough, The Girlfriend Experience), the chaperone of sorts for these poor and dispossessed souls even though she’s not much older than they are. She barks out their marching orders, takes their proceeds, doles out their pay, arranges hotels and gives them tips on which suckers — er, potential subscribers — to approach. She’s also having a fling with Jake and doesn’t appreciate Star’s competition. Then there are the kids themselves who, like Lane, mostly are not professional actors. They radiate a rugged authenticity matched with a sincere vulnerability in keeping with the characters they’re portraying. There’s a scene near the end where they’re singing American Honey, the Lady Antebellum ballad from which the film takes its name, that is both heartbreaking and uplifting. Arnold, whose previous films include the impressive 2009 Fish Tank about a girl who could be Star’s British counterpart, doesn’t really have much new to say about contemporary America or rootless young people living on the knife’s edge. She strays into territory that has already been staked out by the likes of Gus Van Sant (Elephant), Harmony Korine (Spring Breakers), Xavier Dolan (Mommy) and, of course, Larry Clark (Kids). There are times that strain credibility. Would these young people who’ve been on the road all over the U.S. really be all that impressed by the Kansas City skyline? Do the three, possibly squirrelly, middle-age guys driving a land yacht that Star hops into all have to be wearing white cowboy hats? Can they be any more symbolic? And the film is far too long. But Arnold comes up with some impressively exquisite images and Lane’s believable performance as a young woman coming into her own is a sturdy anchor for the film while the plot wanders to its conclusion. American Honey isn’t the definitive square-state portrait by any means, but it’s an often rapturously beautiful snapshot.

Chandler Former VA Cop Gets Prison Time For Killing Unarmed Black Teen News, Video   » by D.L. Chandler (@dlchandler123) Oct 13 2016, 11:28am Share This Tweet This Email This Stephen Rankin, a former Portsmouth, Va. police officer, was sentenced Wednesday (Oct. 12) for the 2015 shooting death of an unarmed Black teen after responding to a shoplifting call. Rankin will serve two and a half years in prison for a voluntary manslaughter charge. According to a report from local outlet WAVY, Ranking, 36, shot and killed William Chapman II, 18, after encountering the teen outside a Walmart in April 2015. The outlet adds that a jury found Rankin guilty of the charge in August after first facing a charge of first-degree murder. Rankin’s defense team rolled out Rankin’s wife as a witness, who testified that her husband was a kind and loving father. WVEC reports that the prosecution placed Rankin’s ex-wife on the stand, who painted a picture of a violent and absent father who would have done worse had he remained an officer in the city. Chapman’s criminal record and was not called into question although a juror in the case said she regrets her guilty verdict after talking to Rankin and learning of the teen’s past. Rankin offered a statement in court to Champman’s mother asking for forgiveness, which was rebuffed by Sally Chapman and the family. WAVY’s video report appears in the clip below. — Photo: Virginia Peninsula Regional Jail Comments: 0 Tags: police shooting, police shootings, virginia Views: 1 Share This Tweet This Email This Leave a Comment Wired VideosHip-Hop Collectors: Check Out Larry “Nuface” Compton’s Insane Tape Collection #DontShoot Report Ohio Cop Was Wearing Confederate Flag T-Shirt Under His Uniform When He Killed Unarmed Black Man #AlfredOlango California Cops Fatally Shoot Mentally Disabled Man That Witnesses Say Had His Hands Up You Can’t Be Serious: Cop Who Killed Paul O’Neal Feared He Was Unarmed, Told ‘Don’t Worry, He Was In A Hot Car’ BOSSIP Exclusive: Will.I.Am Talks Black Lives Matter And Racism In America At Pre-ESPY Event [VIDEO] Houston Police Shoot And Kill Another Black Man, Alva Braziel [Video] White Suspect Held In Connection To Shooting Death Of Iowa Cops NYPD Commish Says It “Failed” Mentally Ill Black Woman After Killing Her Former VA Cop Gets Prison Time For Killing Unarmed Black Teen Ben And Jerry’s: “All Lives Won’t Matter Until Black Lives Matter” San Diego County Cops Shoot & Kill Unarmed Black Man Alfred Olango Charles Kinsey: “Why Did You Shoot Me?” Cop: “I Don’t Know” Bahamas Issues Travel Warning For Its Citizens Traveling To U.S. Lawyer Of Cop Who Killed Philando Castile Says He Reacted To Gun, Not Race “I Wanted Everyone In The World To See What The Police Do” Diamond “Lavish” Reynolds Is Out Of Jail And Wants Justice Baton Rogue Police Kill Black Man, #AltonSterling For Selling CDs What Would You Do If You Were Asked To Sign A Bridesmaids Contract Not To Change Your Appearance Before A Friend’s Wedding? 15 Foods To Eat If You Catch Too Many Colds About That Exit Plan: How Long Is Too Long To Wait For A Ring?

World Bank / IMF Annual Meetings 2016 Winnie Byanyima attended the Annual Meetings of the the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group in October 2016. The Annual and Spring Meetings each year bring together central bankers, ministers of finance and development, private sector executives, civil society, and academics to discuss issues of global concern, including the world economic outlook, global financial stability, poverty eradication, jobs and growth, economic development, and aid effectiveness. The Meetings, which are widely covered by the international media, also offer an opportunity for civil society organizations to share their views and interact with policymakers in a global setting. Ms Byanyima was invited to speak at a high-level event titled "The Governance Gap: Why Does Half the World Distrust Government and What Can We Do About It?" on October 6, 2016. According to the 2016 Edelman Trust Barometer, half the world population distrusts government. Understanding why and how governments can better serve their citizens was the central theme of this high-level public discussion, and more widely a central theme at the Annual Meetings. A transcript of Ms Byanyima's opening remarks can be found below. A video recording of the event can be found here: http://live.worldbank.org/the-governance-gap A blog about the event can be found here: https://blogs.worldbank.org/voices/why-does-half-world-distrust-government EVENT DETAILS Presenter: Kyle Peters - Interim Managing Director and Chief Operating Officer and Vice-President, Operations, World Bank Group Moderator: Clare Short - Chair, Cities Alliance; Former Secretary of State for International Development, UK Panelists: Adnan Khan - Research and Policy Director, International Growth Centre, London School of Economics Winnie Byanyima - Executive Director of Oxfam International Edmund Malesky - Professor of Political Economy at Duke University Henry Rotich - Cabinet Secretary, National Treasury, Kenya -- REMARKS AS PREPARED The Edelman’s data is telling. We see this global distrust as a rational response – to a global economy which is serving the few at the expense of the many. Our world is one in which extreme economic inequality is allowing a few people to accumulate great wealth – and with it political capture. The rich write the rules and rig policy-making in their favour. People are not just losing trust, they’re rightly angry. Whether it be to lower their own taxes or to force austerity whilst expecting bailouts as we saw in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, there’s no shortage of examples of political capture by big business and wealthy elites. In April this year Oxfam published a report titled “Broken at the Top” about the 50 biggest US companies – including global brands such as Pfizer, Goldman Sachs and Walmart.  -    It showed: for every $1 spent on lobbying, these 50 companies collectively received $130 in tax breaks and more than $4,000 in federal loans, loan guarantees and bailouts. That’s a scandalous rate of return. So it’s no surprise that extreme inequality forces governments to choose: reduce the gap between rich and poor, or reduce the ability of citizens to speak out.  Across the world governments are choosing the wrong path, protecting power and wealth by silencing citizens who dare to challenge them. -    CIVICUS research tells us that serious threats to civic freedoms exist now in more than 100 countries. And the International Trade Union Confederation 2016 global rights index surveyed 141 countries and found an increase of 22% in restrictions on the freedom of speech and assembly. My message today for the Bank, and the IMF too is, promote good practices and model good practices. Three things we want to see: First, the Bank and Fund must lock in strong consultation and meaningful engagement with Parliamentarians and with civil society in their programs, including seeking free prior and informed consent where indigenous and local communities are impacted. We’ll be closely following the Bank’s new stakeholder engagement safeguard to make sure there is serious engagement with civil society at all stages of programming – from the strategic level and continued through concept stage, design, implementation, and monitoring.  Second, accountability.  The Bank must continue to develop tools for tracking the quality and delivery of public services.  We are particularly interested in the commitment the Bank has made to seek beneficiary feedback in all its projects – we want to see things move faster. The full feedback loop must include accountability for development outcomes: the Bank can encourage governments to be more accountable, and it can build the demand side through supporting civil society with initiatives like the Global Partnership for Social Accountability. The Bank though must itself be a model for accountability. That means ensuring a well-resourced, independent redress mechanism that all potentially impacted communities know about.  And it means owning and being accountable for the outcomes of lending through financial intermediaries.  Oxfam’s research released this week shows that around 90% of the IFC’s lending in the financial sector is non-transparent and our partners have uncovered dozens of cases linking the IFC to human rights and environmental abuses like displacements, disappearances, and severe air and water pollution in India, Bangladesh, Philippines and Vietnam. The Bank must do better. And my final point brings me back to my initial comments: to rebuild trust, citizens need to see that the rules are written for the benefit of all, not just a few.  We need to close the loopholes on the use of tax havens which are serving elites and big business, whilst placing the burden of tax on the poor and denying governments the revenues to finance the essential services people rely on. In this, the Bank and Fund have a crucial role to play with supporting strong, inclusive, global tax governance and we want to see some concrete steps forward on the new ‘Platform for Collaboration on Tax’, which although not perfect is a step in the right direction.

Plans for the 80-unit Windmill Manor development at 2400 Hawks Drive, Batavia, are moving through the city’s approval process. Residents of the complex must be age 55 or older, and most would pay rent below the market rate. Batavia city aldermen tentatively approved the project at a committee meeting Oct. 4, and are poised to take a final vote Oct. 17. Developer Chris Tritsis is eager to begin site preparation work this fall, before winter progresses in order to be in a position to complete construction at the end of 2017. That would be possible, city planning and zoning officer Joel Strassman said, provided the developer records the age-restriction covenant. The Iowa-based developer, doing business as JNB Batavia, wants to build the three-story apartment building on a 4.5-acre site on the south side of a curving section of Hawks Drive just west of the Batavia Wal-Mart store, near Dreyer Medical Clinic. The plan calls for 60 one-bedroom apartments, and 20 two-bedroom apartments, plus a basement apartment for an on-site manager. Of the 80 apartments, eight would be rented out at the market rate. The remaining 72 would be rent-restricted, as the developer would be receiving a tax credit from the Illinois Housing Development Authority. Mayor Jeff Schielke, taking note of the state’s financial woes, asked Tritsis during the committee meeting if his firm is confident that it has its funding locked up from the IHDA. Tritsis said the tax credit his firm would receive from the IHDA has been approved and would not be affected by the state’s ongoing budget battles. The one-bedroom units would rent for $800 a month, Tritsis said, while the two-bedroom units would be $940 a month. The income limit for residents living in a rent-restricted apartment would be $37,000, Tritsis said. The apartments would remain rent- and age-restricted for 30 years, he said. The project is to receive variances on the building height and the parking requirement, as first approved by the Batavia Plan Commission. The masonry building would stand at most 47 feet tall, 2 feet higher than allowed under city code, depending on the final grading of the sloping topography. The parking lot would have 115 vehicle spaces, rather than the 137 specified for a development of that size. Each apartment in the L-shaped building would have an exterior balcony and be cable-ready, along with offering a fully equipped kitchen and wireless internet. The building will include a main lobby, as well as community, exercise, craft, computer and multimedia rooms, plus sitting areas, a library and beauty salon, Tritsis said. The apartments will have vinyl or laminate floors in the kitchen and bathroom, and wall-to-wall carpeting in the living room and bedrooms, Tritsis said.

A Wal-Mart official stopped by Merrill Middle School to give language arts teacher Kate Hatch a $490 gift card as well as some supplies for her classroom. Hatch's students nominated her for the company's "Commander in Teacher" program. She's one of 20 educators nationwide who won. "It's amazing to be recognized for this; that's really really cool," Hatch said. "And it's awesome that Wal-Mart did this program because I spend a lot of money in my classroom every year." Wal-Mart chose the amount of $490 because that's the average amount one teacher spends out of pocket in a school year.

Expected at Specific Location News provided by AngelSense Oct 13, 2016, 09:48 ET Share this article NEW JERSEY, Oct. 13, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- AngelSense, a GPS & Voice-Monitoring solution designed for children with special needs, today launched a new feature ensuring no child will be left behind. AngelSense's technology allows parents to monitor their child's whereabouts at all times by seeing the child's locations, routes and even transit speed. If a child is determined to still be in a location they should have left, such as school, AngelSense will send an SMS message and an email to the parents or guardian. In recent months there have been a growing number of cases of children with special needs inadvertently left behind at school, on field trips or on school buses. Laura Reed of Easton, Pennsylvania's 12-year-old son, diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome, was left unattended when school ended, fell asleep in a classroom and woke up four hours later. In another example, following a school field trip to Layton Walmart in Utah, 16 year-old non-verbal special needs student, Nathan Anderson, was left behind at the store. To Combat the Wave of Recent Tragedies, AngelSense's Innovative New Feature Sends SMS Notification to Parents if Child Stays Longer Than Expected at Specific Location Ensuring No Child is Left-Behind "Children being left behind is becoming far too common an occurrence especially among the special needs community. This is even more of a problem for nonverbal children, unable to communicate with others," said Doron Somer, co-founder of AngelSense. "AngelSense has a simple solution which will immediately enable a parent to know if their child has not yet moved on to their next expected destination and we hope this will lead to far fewer tragedies of this type taking place". Autism afflicts approximately 1 in 68 children in the United States according to the CDC with nearly half wandering and potentially going missing at least once before their 17th birthday, according to a study by theAmerican Academy of Pediatrics. According to the National Autism Association, a new record was broken in 2015 with over 32 wandering fatalities recorded in individuals with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and over 200 missing persons. A special launch price is being offered for this new AngelSense GPS version available for two weeks only. Learn more at www.angelsense.com About AngelSense AngelSense is a GPS & Voice-Monitoring solution designed for children with special needs, with the mission of creating a safer world for these special children while bringing peace of mind to their families. With AngelSense, parents know exactly where their child is at all times, and can easily monitor their level of safety. Some key features include: immediate text notifications sent to the parent for every unexpected location, car stop and location change; non-removable GPS wearables and accessories designed to adapt to sensory sensitivities of children with special needs; ability to listen-in to the child's environment and surroundings; a unique schedule that captures the child's route and locations throughout the day; and a proven "Wandering Child" solution in case of a lost child or elopement.

[Illustration: MaryliaDesign/iStock] Ben Schiller 10.10.16 10:50 AM At the Greater Lowell Technical High School in Massachusetts, students are learning what it takes to run a CVS store. The school has a full mockup CVS complete with a stocked pharmacy and shelves full of deodorant, toothbrushes, and notebooks. In the very definition of "hands on," students fill prescriptions, manage merchandise and pricing, and market the brand (though the pills they count don't contain active ingredients). To Willa Seldon, a partner with the Bridgespan Group, the initiative is a good example of how companies and schools can work together to develop the talent businesses want. CVS Health has a deep need for entry level staff: it hires 1,000 workers a week to keep its 9,600 locations up and running. And recently it's been looking for "innovative ways to leverage un-tapped talent pools," in the words of David Casey, its vice president of workforce strategies. Three-quarters of the students at Greater Lowell are from low-income backgrounds, and, in the past, they might have been overlooked in favor of applicants who have completed high school and already developed workplace skills. Bridgespan, a consultancy based in Boston, says companies are increasingly meeting their needs by hiring "opportunity youth"—the estimated 6.7 million people aged 16-24 who are neither in school or working. Seldon and her colleagues give some examples in a recent piece in the Stanford Social Innovation Review. State Street, Starbucks, Walmart, JPMorgan Chase, and Gap are all training teens and young adults from low-income communities (sometimes, as in CVS, before youths have left school). Forty-five companies have now joined the 100,000 Opportunities Initiative—a coalition committed to accessing "new sources of talent from communities that have not traditionally been included in our nation’s prosperity." "There's an opportunity to address both the issues companies are facing but also address the issues of youth," Seldon says. "As we think about our future, these youth will ultimately be in positions that will sustain our economy. Not investing in them is a huge long-term issue." Research shows that when young people aren't employed for more than a year, it seriously hurts their future. If you compare males with the same background and one gets a job and the other doesn't, there's a 23% difference in earnings 10 years later. And at the moment, many youths don't have jobs. At 12%, the unemployment rate for 16-to-24 year-olds is roughly double the full out-of-work rate. Seldon says companies are recognizing they can meet their needs while doing good for their communities. "Many companies make some effort to introduce young people to what they do. What's new is that some are now saying 'we actually have a problem finding entry level workers who will stay with our organization' and they are taking a different approach," she argues. That includes collaborating with nonprofits like Year Up, which identifies at-need urban youth, works with companies to understand the skills they need, and then trains young people in IT, finance and sales skills, as well as soft skills like how to dress for an interview and how to deal with criticism during a personnel review. Seldon says investing in such programs produces a win-win in the shape of higher retention rates and reduced costs from having to repeatedly hire new people. For example, Year Up interns that work at State Street, the financial services firm, stay an average of 45 months compared to just 16 months for 20-to 24-year-olds on average across the country. Hiring someone with less schooling and training does come with challenges, and companies need different HR strategies than they've used in the past, Seldon argues. That includes screening candidates for native aptitude rather than their formal educational accomplishments. It means more one-on-one mentoring once young people are on the job. And it means more empathy and flexibility around home-life challenges, from childcare to court dates. But Bridgespan thinks these extra responsibilities are worth it. It estimates companies will have 6 million entry-level positions to fill by 2022. Not to the mention the wider social impact of employing young people. "It’s a business imperative with very real social benefits," says David Casey, at CVS. "By offering opportunities for youth development, companies like ours are able to provide youth with a source of dignity, pride and identity through meaningful work and a more defined career track."

Just like Brexit. Lisa Fleisher lisafleisher Fergal O'Brien fergalob October 13, 2016 — 9:33 AM EDT Updated on October 13, 2016 — 3:17 PM EDT Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Brexit Hits Main Street as U.K. Feels Pound's Pain Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Overnight, the U.K. awoke to fears of a nationwide Marmite shortage. Tesco, the country’s largest supermarket, had stopped online sales of Marmite—an iconic topping commonly spread on toast—in a dispute over price increases. To non-Brits it’s hard to explain the tremor that ripped across the land. But imagine it’s July 3rd in America and Heinz ketchup just got pulled from Walmart.com. The dispute between a supermarket and manufacturer that shot to the top Trending on Twitter mattered because, for the first time, the Brexit fallout was tangible. (The companies late Thursday said they had resolved the issue.) For months, Brits have been arguing about the effects of the country’s break from the EU. The pound dropped 18%, sure, but was that really a bad thing? The pro-Brexit camp argued the currency plunge would be great for British exporters. Opponents warned of coming inflation. Both sides accused the other of scaremongering, before and after the vote. In the background, examples of creeping Brexit impacts came and went. Apple raised the iPhone 7 price 11% in Britain from the iPhone 6, while holding the line in the U.S. Dell and Peugeot also raised prices.  But it took a fight between two of the world’s biggest consumer companies over a uniquely British product to show Brexit will have real-world impacts.  Matthew Campbell @MattCampbel The GBP meltdown is causing a Marmite shortage. If anything reverses the referendum result, it's this: https://t.co/Uv5xk3nYwP Twitter: Matthew Campbell on Twitter What is Marmite? It’s a dark brown spread used on bread and crackers like a jam, but thick and pungent. The British product—a concentrated yeast extract left over from the brewing process—was created in the 19th century and bought by the Anglo-Dutch packaged-goods giant Unilever in 2000. The name is a French word for cooking pot. And like Brexit, people either love it or hate it, a characteristic that lies at the heart of the company's marketing. Why did it disappear? Well, it didn’t. But Tesco stopped selling it online, along with a host of other products including Ben & Jerry's ice cream, after Unilever reportedly said it wanted to raise prices an average of 10%. Even products made in the U.K. have ingredients that are imported. Vikas Shah @DrVikasShah It's not just Marmite. @Unilever produces all of these too. It's Armageddon. #tesco #brexit https://t.co/qUXN4gxbaO Twitter: Vikas Shah on Twitter Is this the type of inflation that British people are going to be dealing with from now on? The pound’s drop is already hitting the costing of foreign goods, and some of the country’s biggest stores have warned of looming price hikes. Import prices are increasing at the fastest pace in five years as energy costs rise and sterling’s drop makes everything priced in foreign currencies more expensive. Almost every economist agrees that the inflation rate is going higher. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg see it averaging 2.2% in 2017, about three times the rate forecast for this year and above the Bank of England’s 2% target. While that’s not a disaster (inflation hit 5% in 2011), if wage growth doesn’t also pick up from its current 2.1% pace, that means a squeeze on wallets. Mike Bird @Birdyword "Remember that time import prices rose 10%?""No""When they had the Marmite shortage, and the killer clown thing""Oh yeah of course" Twitter: Mike Bird on Twitter   What can the Bank of England do about inflation? What does that mean for interest rates? Governor Mark Carney has said the bank faces a trade-off between supporting growth and controlling inflation. So far, it’s prioritized growth by cutting interest rates to 0.25% and pumping more money into the economy. Carney has said he’s open to cutting the key rate again, but that could weaken the pound further. On the other hand, if policymakers want to combat inflation, it will be tough to raise rates if there’s still uncertainty about the strength of the economy. So what does this mean for the economy? The economy may not be heading for a recession, but it’s expected to lose steam. Consumer spending is still expected to grow, but the Bank of England estimates it will only rise 1% next year, down from 2.5%. And economic growth is expected to slide to 0.8% from 2%, though many expect the forecast to improve next month.

(Reuters) — A former Portsmouth, Virginia, police officer was sentenced on Wednesday to 2-1/2 years in prison for the shooting death of an unarmed Black teenager last year, a court spokesman said. The ex-officer, Stephen Rankin, 36, was convicted of voluntary manslaughter in August for shooting William Chapman II, 18, while investigating a shoplifting report at a Walmart store. Portsmouth Circuit Court Judge Johnny Morrison denied a request by Rankin’s lawyer that he remain free while his conviction is appealed, the spokesman said in a telephone call. Rankin, who is white, was fired by the Portsmouth Police Department after his grand jury indictment. Prosecutors argued that Rankin had killed Chapman in April 2015 in what had amounted to little more than a parking lot fistfight in Portsmouth, about 175 miles south of Washington. William Chapman II The sentencing came amid a roiling U.S. debate over police use of deadly force, especially against African-Americans. A Washington Post database showed that 754 people have been fatally shot by police this year, with 24 percent of them Black. Rankin is among 26 officers to be convicted of murder or manslaughter for an on-duty shooting out of 77 charged since 2005, Phillip Stinson, an associate professor of criminal justice at Ohio’s Bowling Green State University, said in a telephone call. Twenty-nine of the charges were leveled in the last two years alone, but Stinson said the numbers were too small to indicate a trend of officers being charged. Rankin had shot and killed an unarmed man in 2011 while responding to a burglary call. No charges were filed over that shooting, and Rankin won a related civil trial.

(Reuters/Alexander Demianchuk) Share Written by Noah Toly Senior fellow, Chicago Council on Global Affairs Obsession Borders October 13, 2016 Cities are shaping the future of global affairs. Over the next seven days, tens of thousands of people from around the world will convene in Quito for Habitat III. Heads of state, mayors, corporate leaders, and civil society representatives will join this United Nations conference to explore ways in which cities shape the planet. Through mass urbanization and growing economic power, cities are poised to shake up the future world order. In terms of sheer economic size, today’s top cities already belong to an elite class of global actors that includes large nation-states and leading multi-national corporations. My organization, the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, has found that 42 of the largest 100 economic entities in the world are cities. This marks a significant increase over a 2010 study by the World Bank when cities accounted for 34 of the 100 largest economies. Cities—which have long been hubs of the global economy, facilitating both flows and concentrations of people, goods, resources, and wealth—are now amassing economic power at an accelerating pace. But when Tokyo and New York City have GDPs that rival those of Canada, Spain, and Turkey, what does that really mean for their political influence? Like countries, cities–and networks of cities–can use economic leverage to achieve global governance goals. The beginnings of the G7, as well as other politically influential emerging market groups like the Asian Tigers (Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan), BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), and MINT (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Turkey), have their origins in economic ascendancy. And if many cities now have economic footprints on par with influential nation-states, it stands to reason that they will have similar opportunities to band together to encourage, limit, and channel economic activity—not just within their bounds but across continents. The rise of cities parallels the increasing impact of the multinational corporations (MNCs) featured on our top 100 economies list. MNCs have exercised extraordinary, if sometimes controversial, influence by using their economic might to shape business-friendly trade deals, tax structures, and environmental regulations. So when Mexico City and Guangzhou have economic outputs comparable to the world’s seven largest corporations—Wal-Mart, Royal Dutch Shell, China Petroleum & Chemical, Exxon Mobil, British Petroleum, PetroChina, and Volkswagen—it’s worth examining how they too might exercise similar influence. Though cities lack the leverage provided by corporate mobility, they possess even greater credibility as politically legitimate actors representing the interests of their local populations. 42 of the largest 100 economic entities in the world are cities. (The Chicago Council on Global Affairs) Both individually and collectively, cities are already shaping the contours of global affairs. Recent research by the City Leadership Initiative at University College London finds that more than 150 city networks were founded in 2015 alone. From the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group to United Cities and Local Governments, these organizations reach beyond the boundaries of cities to project influence on issues from security and economic policy to public health and the environment, even as they promote local democratic governance of basic services. Along with the International Standards Organization, corporate partners, civil society organizations, and the United Nations, these networks of cities are reshaping the collection and use of data to promote sustainable, resilient communities. Yet cities are also confronting risks to their growing role in the world, as environmental and political challenges threaten to destabilize the economic status quo on which cities have expanded their influence. But in responding to these threats, cities have the opportunity to further expand their impact in the world. Consider the environment. Due to their geography, many of the world’s most economically influential cities are extremely vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Indeed, seven of the ten cities most vulnerable to climate change are among our top 100 economies. The effects of climate change–including extreme weather events, sea level rise, and shifting geographic distributions of diseases such as malaria–threaten to undermine these cities’ economic viability. At the same time, cities are a significant source of pollution but also have a lower per-capita emissions rate. This means they likely have outsized influence on both sides of climate change—and an imperative to address this challenge. Cities can, for example, use green infrastructure initiatives, transportation regulations, and building codes to channel their economic output in ways that decrease their carbon footprint. At the same time, cities can increase their carbon handprints—a measure of their deliberate and artful stewardship of ecological impacts. Importantly, no city can do it alone. A climate stable future will require city networks and collaborations, such as C40 , to harmonize objectives, spread best practices, and develop new norms. Many of the world’s most economically influential cities are also plagued by extreme income disparities, lack of access to high quality affordable housing, and low levels of economic mobility. Political disenfranchisement, social exclusion, and economic inequality undermine the ability and threaten the legitimacy of cities to act on the global stage. Moreover, while many major cities reap the benefits of global engagement, integration, and openness, their broader regions are left behind to suffer these economic, political, and social stresses. Such regional disparities were among the drivers of the Brexit referendum and eventual decision by UK voters to leave the EU. A raft of similar movements in favor of more closed economies would likely deprive cities of some measure of global influence. A more politically stable future will require cities and city networks to systematically reduce the local and regional inequalities that threaten to destabilize the open world order on which increasing urban economic output has been built. Seen this way, we may not yet know how cities will influence global power dynamics, but it’s unlikely they’ll simply be able to prop up a world order fraught with environmental and political instabilities. Cities have two options: On the one hand, they may be able to channel economic output in a way that resolves those instabilities and leads toward a more climate-stable and politically legitimate world order. On the other hand, if they do not do this, the status quo may prove unsustainable. Either way, massive changes may be in the offing. For more information on the rise of cities, read the Chicago Council on Global Affairs’ new report, “Top 100 Economies: Urban Influence and the Position of Cities in an Evolving World Order.” We welcome your comments at ideas@qz.com.

Apple Pay faces increased competition from other mobile-payment services Bloomberg News Oct 13, 2016 (…) THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Apple Pay, which turns two years old this month, is facing stiffer competition and needs to find ways to stand out in a crowded field. Five months after shaking hands with Apple, retailer Kohl’s is starting to compete with the tech giant’s mobile-payment service, Apple Pay. For Apple, the market leader of in-store mobile payments, moves like that of Kohl’s are becoming increasingly familiar. Over the summer, Walmart Stores rolled out its own mobile-payment service nationwide and pharmacy chain CVS Health introduced CVS Pay. Apple Pay, which turns two years old this month, is facing stiffer competition and needs to find ways to stand out in a crowded field. In the next year, most retailers and fast-food restaurants will start their own mobile-payment services, and some of them will also offer Apple Pay. Apple, which expanded into Russia earlier this month, is looking to absorb more functions of people’s traditional wallets, such as transit cards and retail loyalty cards. “You want to get into as many use cases as possible,” said Greg Weed, director of card performance research at Phoenix Marketing International. “The wallet app is ideally suited to self-service types of terminals: gas pumps, vending machines, transit. All of this stuff builds transactions. All of these things build up utility.” Apple hasn’t disclosed the terms it’s reached for Apple Pay or broken out sales that it gets from the service. Assuming that it gets a small percentage of every transaction, the revenue is still negligible for the company, which posted total sales of almost $234 billion in its most recent fiscal year. That revenue included $19.9 billion in services, of which transaction fees are a part. The value of in-store transactions by people paying with their mobile phones, known as proximity payments, is expected to reach $210 billion by 2019 in the United States, according to researcher eMarketer. While that may produce a small but growing stream of revenue for the technology giant, the Apple Pay feature may also make the company’s phones more attractive, boosting loyalty among users and helping Apple compete with rivals like Samsung Electronics. Apple has spent much of the past two years raising awareness of its payment feature and getting consumers to use it in stores, apps and, most recently, online. Services such as Apple Pay accounted for 9 percent of in-store credit-card transactions and about 5 percent of credit-card dollars spent, according to a May survey by Phoenix, which asked some 5,100 adults about their spending over one month. While it’s made headway, Apple Pay has a way to go to gain mass adoption, partly because some people don’t see it as an improvement over the current way of doing things. To boost usage, Cupertino, California-based Apple needs to show that its product is superior to a credit card. According to Pymnts.com and InfoScout, 58 percent of people in a June survey said Apple Pay is just as easy as a card, while 56 percent of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus users said both methods take about the same amount of time. “They haven’t proven their mobile-wallet applications are better than existing payment mechanisms,” said Jordan McKee, a senior analyst for payments at 451 Research. Adding value is “the next frontier for this whole space.” The company declined to comment for this story. Banks and retailers see a big part of that value addressed by integrating payments more deeply with rewards, coupons and loyalty programs. Capital One Financial Corp. has added more transaction analysis and control features, said Tom Poole, a managing vice president at the bank. It lets customers activate and disable their bank-issued cards via its app. Samsung Pay lets users earn gift cards from Dunkin’ Donuts as well as earn money with its own rewards prepaid card. Alphabet Inc., the parent of Google, tested its own loyalty program, the Tap 10, earlier this year. Last week, Kohl’s unveiled its mobile-payment option, Kohl’s Pay, which will integrate its private-label credit card into its mobile app. That will let the more than 25 million Kohl’s Charge users pay for purchases with their mobile phones. The service was announced five months after Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin-based Kohl’s added Apple Pay to its mobile app. “We are interested in supporting payments — whatever payments our customers feel like are important to them,” said Ratnakar Lavu, Kohl’s chief technology officer. Kohl’s Pay users will be able to redeem Kohl’s Cash, apply a coupon and pay for a transaction with one click — something they can’t do with Apple Pay.

The three-story structure, which was funded with private donations, aimed to "partner with industry sectors, organizations and business leaders to develop their leadership capability and build organizational performance," according to a UM press release. One of the first construction workers hired to lay the building's foundation was Jennifer Moen, a tan, lanky 35-year-old. She'll never forget that job—she was homeless at the time and living in her car with her two young kids. After a long shift pouring concrete at the Gilkey site, she'd pick up her kids from a babysitter, park in a Wal-Mart lot overnight and try to keep them warm. "It was definitely one of those rough moments in my life I never wanna experience again," Moen says. Since she was making more than $20 an hour, Moen didn't question the desperately needed paychecks—until one day, when she met a union organizer who told her that, according to state law, she and everyone else hired by Northwest Concrete and Excavation deserved to get paid twice as much. "I didn't really know what the rate was, honestly. I thought that it was fine," Moen says. "I didn't really pay attention." Moen's case is just one example of how disadvantaged workers can easily be misused in a construction industry that's infrequently policed, according to Miles McCarvel, the ironworker and union organizer who approached Moen. click to enlarge "If you give a little, they'll keep on asking for more," McCarvel says. "That's no different with our contractors or anybody else. If somebody can make more money by screwing somebody, they often do." By the Montana Labor Management Alliance's estimate, construction workers have had to fight to recover nearly $5 million in unpaid wages in the past 10 years. McCarvel and other labor advocates say that's probably just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to worker exploitation in the state. When the Gilkey project started, McCarvel walked up to the top floor of a nearby campus building and set up his telescope to keep watch through the window. He acknowledges that it might look a little bit nutty, but as a union organizer, it's part of his job to keep an eye on major public construction projects for any possible wrongdoing and to encourage nonunion workers to join the Local 14. While observing the Gilkey site, he questioned how Northwest Concrete's workers were tying rebar—a process where sections of reinforced steel are tied with metal wire so they stay steady while the concrete foundation is poured in. "For one thing, there was a pile of rebar everywhere. It was a mess," McCarvel says. State law sets the prevailing wages for the building industries each year. Ironworkers are at the very top, making about $50 an hour, including benefits. Carpenters make about $30 an hour, general laborers make $27 an hour, and so on. People working on public projects worth more than $25,000—such as the Gilkey Building—are supposed to earn prevailing wages. After several hours of observation, McCarvel decided he'd seen enough. He walked to the job site, introduced himself to Moen and asked what she was making. Since Moen tied rebar, which is classified as ironwork, she ought to have been making ironworker wages. Instead, she was making about $24 an hour. When McCarvel asked to look at her pay stubs, he noticed strange discrepancies—one week, she'd be paid a salary, the next week, she'd be paid hourly. "No one's ever told me what it was supposed to be, until Miles stopped and pulled me aside," Moen says. McCarvel advised Moen to send in copies of her paycheck stubs to the state Department of Labor, and she tried to find the handful that she'd kept. In Montana, the onus is on the employee to initiate wage claims. It's especially tough to call out wrongdoing, McCarvel says, when employees don't want to risk losing their jobs. "The only way you can catch [contractors] is if you have an employee that isn't job scared, that probably just got fired or something, that kept all their paycheck stubs and knows the law," McCarvel says. "Which almost never happens." In December 2014, a state wage compliance specialist visited the Gilkey project as part of a routine visit, where an investigator determined that two of Northwest's employees were being paid incorrectly. In January, Northwest Concrete fired Moen. The termination letter, signed by Northwest owner Mark King, says her employment ended because of "insubordination," being frequently late to work and having a "negative" attitude. She thinks she was fired simply because she started to speak up about her pay. By May 2015, after Moen submitted a formal wage claim, the state says investigators felt obliged to undertake an audit of every Northwest employee's payment. States vary widely in approaches to wage theft. Idaho, for instance, is a right-to-work state with fewer prevailing wage requirements. Others, like Utah and Washington, strenuously monitor employers. Between 2013 and 2015, the Utah Department of Labor recovered $1.7 million in pay owed to its residents. Washington keeps an online database where it's easy to look up companies by name to see if they've been found guilty of shortchanging workers. click to enlarge photo by Amy Donovan Montana is, by contrast, much less transparent when it comes to wage theft. No database of guilty employers exists online, nor does the Montana Department of Labor issue routine public reports about wage theft. The Wage and Hour Unit, tasked with enforcing prevailing wages, employs three compliance specialists to monitor the entire state construction industry. Wage and Hour Bureau Chief Pam McDaniel has served the Department of Labor for over 30 years. She acknowledges that the three investigators' scope is limited. "We don't hit every project, we're just trying to be out there and be within [some of] the projects throughout the whole state," McDaniel says. She also says that in her entire career, she can't recall a time when she's been asked about prevailing wage laws by a reporter. In 2015, the Wage and Hour Unit reviewed 110 business payrolls and conducted 49 on-site visits. That represents a small fraction of the thousands of construction projects throughout the state. The city of Missoula alone issued 473 building permits in 2015. When prevailing wage specialists take note of a problem, such as incorrect or misclassified wages, McDaniel says they notify the contractors, architects and engineers associated with the project.

By Staff Reports - 10/12/16 10:12 PM Used to be we often muted the news when the kids were in the room, but these days we don’t even turn it on. And our kids are in their 30s. Oh, the kids can take it alright, it’s the grands and the little ones we worry about. The world has become a 24/7 news cycle of screaming sirens, flashing lights, shootings, robberies and racial strife with police in the cross-hairs, all of which is punctuated by the occasional Wal-Mart brawl. In my hometown, we’ve had three Amber Alerts in two weeks, an 82-year-old man shot in his driveway and a mother who confessed to smothering her two children with her own hands. We’ve grown numb. We barely turn our heads when another teacher or coach is charged with molestation. Fifteen years out from 9/11 and terrorism is not behind us; it is all around us. And then there’s the political corruption — seemingly without end. The cherry on top of this sundae is a growing narcissism screaming for attention, constantly beating the drum on the many ways we are all offended. College students, increasingly delicate, now require speech codes, safe spaces and trigger warnings. The mob rule of Twitter or Facebook is the new court of justice. The standards of right and wrong that held us together for centuries seem to be crumbling. So how do you raise kids in a world like this? In a world that some days feels like it is in a free fall? You do it the same way generations before have done it. The same way others leaned in to the winds of the unknown and the uncertain, upheaval, unrest, strife, tragedy and even war. You start with the premise that (trigger warning) life isn’t easy. Then you create a home that is a shelter in the storm, a place where family and friends can be comfortable, where conversation, creativity, thoughts and ideas are free to flourish. You use that home as your children’s first school and understand that you are their first teacher. You teach the things you want them to know by modeling them yourself. If you don’t want your kids cowering in fear and lacking confidence, then you can’t cower in fear and lack confidence. Introduce your children to heroes, both past and present, real-people heroes who have stood strong in the face of challenge and adversity. Then show your children how to stand — for things that are good and true and honorable. And if you claim to hold the Christian faith, don’t just hold it, live it. Live those words about loving the Lord your God with all your heart and your neighbor as yourself. A scholar friend says the word neighbor means nearest. Demonstrate how to love those nearest, in your families, schools, neighborhoods, work places, houses of worship and the businesses where you shop. If you do even a few of these things, the clouds won’t seem so ominous. Nothing dispels the darkness like a few shafts of light.

Passed in 1981 to ensure businesses did not mislead customers about their rights, the Truth in Consumer Contract, Warranty, and Notice Act helped eliminate confusing language in sales offers, store notices, and product liability statements. And then it sat quietly, a seldom-noticed piece of the state's legal furniture. But when the New Jersey Civil Justice Institute and the Morris County Chamber of Commerce held a forum with prominent lawyers Tuesday on the "unintended consequences" of legislation, TCCWNA trumped other topics. New Jersey civil courts are being hit with suits from around the country using TCCWNA to challenge the terms and conditions listed on some commercial websites. Big corporations, including Wal-Mart, Hertz, and Bed Bath & Beyond, have been hit with class-action suits charging they violated the little-known New Jersey statute. "There has been a literal blizzard of demand letters that have gone out to businesses across the country," said Edward Fanning, chair of the product liability group at McCarter & English. The letters are warnings from plaintiffs' attorneys, contending the terms and conditions of sales, discounts, memberships, and other offers made via websites could violate TCCWNA. Although the law's penalties are slight — $100, actual damages, or both — they apply to each infraction, Fanning noted. That makes it a potentially devastating tool against the owners of heavily trafficked websites, he said. The demand letters warn "hundreds of thousands or even millions of people may have been exposed" to multiple confusing terms, even if they were just casually browsing a website rather than shopping, Fanning said. Another key provision of the New Jersey statute is that it applies not just to customers who bought a lamp or joined a club but to any "prospective consumer." The penalties must be paid to any "aggrieved consumer," not only those who completed transactions. "What's amazing about the statute is that so much of it is undefined," said Zane Riester, another McCarter & English lawyer. "An 'aggrieved consumer,' there's very little case law on what that means … and you really can't have an aggrieved prospective consumer," he said. "I do think there has to be some level of harm." But some lawyers say that while the Legislature may not have anticipated the rise of e-commerce, it spelled out its intentions when approving the law. "The act is very clear that the (misleading) writing can be contained in a mere offer," said Joseph DePalma, co-founder and managing member of Lite DePalma Greenberg. "So you don't have to enter into a contract." With major decisions pending in both state and federal courts, where the big class-action suits were filed, defense attorneys and their business clients should not be overly confident about the outcomes, said Jeff Jacobson, a former legal director for the state attorney general's office now in private practice. "The legislative history is clear as a bell," he said. One of the last laws signed by Gov. Brendan Byrne before he left office, TCCWNA had a prime target, "Void where prohibited." Advertisements, store notices, warranty forms, and even contracts contained this and similarly nebulous disclaimers. They seldom specified what was prohibited or where. The problem is, "those provisions aren't legal in New Jersey," Jacobson said. The act tackled that directly, saying, "No consumer contract, notice, or sign shall state that any of its provisions is or may be void, unenforceable, or inapplicable in some jurisdictions without specifying which provisions are or are not void, unenforceable, or inapplicable within the State of New Jersey." When passing the short bill, the state Legislature presented its view of the problem. As a complement to protections against fraud, legislators wanted consumers to know their legal rights. "Far too many consumer contracts, warranties, notices, and signs contain provisions which clearly violate the rights of consumers," the legislative statement said, adding, "Their very inclusion in a contract, warranty, notice, or sign deceives a consumer." The issue also had become one of safety, as some businesses expanded their disclaimers, attempting to evade responsibility for physical conditions on their property. "Public storage firms had provisions in their contracts that said if you slip and fall on my premises, even if it's my fault, you're liable," Jacobson said. "And if you bring your Uncle Joe to help you and he slips and falls, you have to indemnify me against any claim that he might bring." Recent cases show how TCCWNA is being cited in e-commerce disputes. In February, Darla Braden of Ocean County filed suit against TTI Floor North America of Solon, OH, the makers of Hoover vacuum cleaners, objecting to a liability disclaimer on the company's website. In March, David Hecht of Closter sued Hertz in federal court, seeking to establish a class suit challenging the car rental company's terms for a rewards program. His suit contends the company does not say what conditions apply in New Jersey. Worried companies should remember that "with respect to website terms of use, less is more," Riester said. Some courts have allowed fuzzy updates of "void where prohibited," such as "to the fullest extent allowed under applicable law." "If you've only received a letter, do nothing, and by that I don't mean nothing, do your due diligence," and tweak the language of any disclaimers, Riester said. "I always advise people to fix the problem," without going to court when possible, Jacobson said. If a website has attracted one challenge that might mean paying $1,000, "well, we (attorneys) will charge $1,000 to open the envelope," he said. Click here for reuse options!

The strikes aim to reform the unjust conditions of the inmates mandatory jobs within the system. (Natalie Goldstein / Daily Titan) It’s been over a month since Sept. 9 marked the start of America’s largest prison labor strike in history, and it has yet to be covered by mainstream media. Due to this lack of coverage, it’s nearly impossible to discover whether this momentous event is even still going on or not. The New York Times, The Washington Post, NBC News, ABC News, MSNBC, Fox News, CNN and NPR have all ignored this historic demonstration. The reason is largely due to the fact that many major corporate sponsors such as AT&T, Bank of America, Chevron, GEICO, McDonald’s and Walmart all use prison labor to their benefit, according to Paste Magazine. Verizon, for example, uses prison labor for its telecommunication services. As the owner of Yahoo and The Huffington Post, it would be a conflict of interest for Verizon or any other sponsor to partially fund the coverage of the strike. The prisoners’ collective goal is mainly to bring attention to horrific working conditions for inmates within the prisons, as well as the unjust lack of compensation. This prison strike is the first of its kind being nationally organized and coordinated among prisoners. They collectively advocate that if prison wages are raised, it will increase institution costs. Once that happens, the profitability of contracting out prison labor will go down, thereby eliminating any corrupt, profit-based incentives for mass incarceration, according to the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee. The strikes have been fairly peaceful and civil thus far, so the media has no angle in which they could skew this story to make the message of their protests forgotten. They have chosen to keep the story out of the media all together. Only small, liberal news sources have reported on the prison strike, making it difficult to find the specifics of what is going on and just how many people are involved. However, it has been reported to be taking place in prisons across more than 24 states with over 24,000 prisoners participating in the strike. The media’s silence speaks even louder than the strike itself, pointing to the immediate need for private prison sectors, and the prison system in general, to be intensely reformed. Prisoner activists are calling attention to prison labor conditions that activists call “modern-day slavery,” citing the Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution which abolished slavery, with the exception for convicted criminals, according to Mother Jones, a nonprofit news organization. These people may be in prison, but they are still human beings, and many of them have families they are trying to support while doing the time for their crimes. Their complaints do not lie in the work they are supposed to do, but in the payment for this work. Most people think of prisoners as these horrible murderers and sex offenders who don’t deserve to be paid for their work. But the Federal Bureau of Prisons reported that as of Aug. 27, only 3.1 percent of people in prison, 5,554 to be exact, are there because of homicide, aggravated assault and kidnapping offenses. A whopping 83,982 inmates, making up 46.4 percent of the prison population, are there due to drug offenses. The majority of inmates do not get paid for the mandatory work that able-bodied prisoners must do, and those who do get paid make between 12 to 40 cents an hour. However, even those wages are subject to taxes and deductions. Companies who use prison labor, referred to as insourcing, are not required to provide health insurance or sick days. They also don’t need to worry about unions, vacation time, raises or family issues. This leads to companies extorting the inmates who can’t protect themselves. Not only are the wages poor, but so are the working conditions since there are very few safety standards in place for prison facilities to adhere to. Because courts do not consider prisoners to be employees, they are not covered under the Fair Labor Standards Act and are not allowed any legal way to ask for better wages or work conditions. “It’s an easy population to exploit physically, labor-wise and by every other means,” said Paul Wright, an editor at Prison Legal News, to Mother Jones. The United States has less than five percent of the world’s population but almost 25 percent of the world’s prisoners, said Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. The total incarcerated population has gone up 500 percent in the last 30 years, leaving us with 2.4 million people imprisoned, according to Mic. The privatization of prisons has led imprisonment to be a means for the corporate sponsors to profit off the backs of mostly black and hispanic men who were imprisoned instead of being given rehabilitation. In addition, everyone invested in private prisons is invested in keeping it this way. Protesting injustice is what created our country in the first place. Looking over the history of the U.S., it is clear that most progress can be linked back to a group of people standing in the streets, fighting for what they believe in–a woman’s right to vote, the end of legalized segregation, gay marriage and so many more great movements. No wonder the major media news outlets don’t want to cover this enormous piece of world news–they would have to value their journalistic integrity over their money and exploitation, and we all know that big corporations would never do that.

By Gwendolyn Ann Smith Originally printed 10/13/2016 (Issue 2441 - Between The Lines News) print email facebook twitter stumble upon Google Plus Clothing retailer H&M, edging into the fall fashion season, released a new television advertisement. Set to a cover of the Tom Jones's hit "She's A Lady," the ad features women of several ethnicities, ages and body types flaunting H&Ms fashions. It's a positive, affirming message chock full of the sort of feel-good tropes I would expect from any fashion-forward retailer in 2016. Or it's "disgusting" and "confusing for children" if you are a member of the anti-LGBT hate group One Million Moms. "1MM is not sure of H&M clothing company's thought process behind their new television ad," says the group, "but if they are attempting to offend customers and families, they have succeeded." They then list three offensive things they spotted in the ad, including two teen girls kissing, a woman wearing underwear, and, yes, a "man dressed as a woman." Unfortunately for One Million Moms, the "man" they are claiming is corrupting their youth is Fatima Pinto, one of the world's top Thai boxers. Pinto does not identify as transgender. Nor, for that matter, as a man. So what was it that One Million Moms was looking at? Pinto appears in the H&M spot in a black, spaghetti-strap top with her braided hair tied back, revealing her strong, built physique in the process. One can only assume they looked at the musculature of her arms and upper body, the lack of immediately-visible tresses, and her scant cleavage, and simply assumed that she must be male. Pinto is not alone here: quite a number of non-transgender women have faced even worse, particularly in the way of ill-considered, anti-trans "bathroom bills." Consider Courtney Bogorad, who was pushed against a wall by a security guard at Fishbones restaurant in Detroit, Michigan in June of last year. She claims the guard, after grabbing her, told her "boys aren't allowed in this restroom." The same thing happened in April of this year, when Jessica Rush was followed into a restroom at Baylor Medical Center in Frisco, Texas. Ditto for Aimee Toms, who was harassed by another restroom user at a Connecticut Wal-Mart last May. Likewise for Sally Kohn, who another bathroom user in a New York City office building harassed. <A href="http://pridesource.advertserve.com/servlet/click/zone?zid=13&pid=0&lookup=true&position=1" target="_top"> <IMG src="http://pridesource.advertserve.com/servlet/view/banner/image/zone?zid=13&pid=0&position=1" height="250" width="300" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Click Here!"> </A> Indeed, it would seem that it is far more common for a non-transgender woman -- who happens to violate supposed gender norms by wearing her hair short and wearing attire that is not viewed as stereotypically feminine -- to face harassment for being in the wrong restroom than it is for a transgender woman. What all this leads me to ponder is this: what do non-transgender people, especially those who oppose transgender rights, think transgender people actually look like? Now I might think their main models would come out of popular culture, and likely not the more positive - and real - examples like actress Laverne Cox of "Orange is the New Black" or sports celeb Caitlyn Jenner. No, I would be thinking of Jared Leto's Rayon from "Dallas Buyers Club," Eddie Redmayne as Lili Elbe in "The Danish Girl," or Jeffrey Tambor's Maura Pfefferman. You know, the literal "man in a dress" that One Million Moms was complaining about. It would certainly make sense. All of the above have been successful, and feature big-name stars. Heck, Leto took home an Academy Award for his portrayal, which would seem to signal at least some popular knowledge of his trans portrayal, and Tambor's portrayal -- admittedly a far step above Leto or Redmayne -- garnered him an Emmy, a Golden Globe and plenty of other hardware for the mantle. Yet if these were the templates for this bathroom panic ensnaring so many non-transgender women, wouldn't said women have had to be sporting, well, something distinctly feminine? All of the above portrayals display the usual trappings of stereotypical femininity: makeup, dresses, jewelry and so on. Yet the women who I named above were not so equipped when they had their restroom run-ins. You see, the insidious thing about the bills -- and perhaps even more, with the way they get sold to voters -- isn't that you're keeping actual transgender people out of restrooms, but making predators. The advertisements, such as one used successfully by the Campaign for Houston's Proposition One battle, briefly shows someone unmistakably male, in a checked shirt and flat cap, skulking into a women's room. The image is not that of a transwoman, nor for that matter how many actual, real transgender women may exist in popular culture, nor even how Hollywood often poorly presents portrayals as men in dresses. What is being pushed is that men will go into the restroom, wearing stereotypically masculine attire, and claim to be women. It is an image of transgender people that doesn't even feature a transgender person. Hence you see why so many non-transgender women are getting caught up in this. This whole thing is not only restricting the rights of transgender people, it is putting women who don't adhere to strict gender self-policing at risk. I would go so far as to say it could potentially put more non-binary, transmasculine and early-in-transition transmen at risk than it would transwomen -- certainly a consequence unconsidered by many. Perhaps even those in a certain H&M ad who are wearing more masculine-styled attire. So to H&M and Fatima Pinto I say thank you -- and to many others, I say this: we all simply want to live our lives, without people treating us as predators simply for our gender identity and expression.

Commissioner Ralph Hudgens said in a statement Monday that Allstate has filed an auto rate increase of 25 percent that’s expected to be implemented May 22. Hudgens says he’s concerned about the filing and his office is evaluating whether the planned rate increase is legally excessive. Allstate spokesman Adam Polak said in an email that the rate filing applies to one of Allstate’s three underwriting companies in Georgia and represents less than half of Allstate’s auto insurance business in Georgia. Polak says market conditions including the number of miles driven, the number of traffic fatalities and costs associated with repairs have factored into an increase in claims and costs associated with settling them. Board of Regents backs no tuition hikes at Georgia schools Board of Regents backs no tuition hikes at Georgia schools ATLANTA (AP) - The cost of an education at Georgia’s 29 public colleges won’t be going up this fall for the first time in more than a decade. The Board of Regents formally voted Wednesday not to increase tuition for the 2016-2017 school year. Until this year, the system’s governing board had approved some form of tuition increase every year since at least 2002. Last year, most state-operated colleges in Georgia saw a 2.5-percent tuition increase for the fourth year in a row. Students at Georgia Tech and the University of Georgia received even greater increases of 9 percent. Atlanta Police to launch Smash-and-Grab Task Force Atlanta Police to launch Smash-and-Grab Task Force Atlanta Police George Turner Thursday announced that his department will be forming a special unit to combat the rash of smash-and-grab crimes that have plagued upscale boutiques in the city. The announcement comes on the heels of a group of thieves who made off with between $50,000 and $100,000 in men’s clothing last week after pulling a gun on an Atlanta boutique employee and customer. News outlets report that seven men in three separate cars on April 6 ransacked the high-end Moda404 Men’s Boutique in Atlanta’s Buckhead neighborhood. A police report says one of the suspects pretended to be a customer so he could be buzzed into the store. After telling the clerk he was heading to the bank to withdraw money to make a purchase, police say the suspect opened the door to allow the other members in his group to rush inside, snatch clothing and drive away. Teen suspect sought in murder of community activist Teen suspect sought in murder of community activist Atlanta Police say they are searching for 17-year-old Eric Banks in the shooting death of community leader Barney Sims. Police identified him as the person who was seen in a video dining with Simms hours before his killing. Simms, 70, was found about 4 p.m. last Sunday in his yard with at least one gunshot wound, police reported. Banks should be considered armed and dangerous, police say. Anyone with any information should call 911 or Crime Stoppers Greater Atlanta at 404.577.TIPS. Thousands of Fulton Co. voter info cards delayed, returned Thousands of Fulton Co. voter info cards delayed, returned ATLANTA (AP) - Officials are investigating why thousands of voters in Fulton County didn’t get precinct information cards in time for the state’s primary. Director of Fulton County Elections and Registration Richard Barron told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution Monday (http://bit.ly/1qjSeCa ) that thousands of voters didn’t get precinct cards on time - or at all - for the state’s March 1 primary. Spokeswoman for the Georgia Secretary of State Candice Broce and spokesman for the U.S. Postal Service Rick Badie say their offices are investigating. Barron says the layout of the card may have factored into many of the materials being delayed or returned. He says the cards include three addresses, and addresses for polling places are printed on the cards twice. Fulton County was also investigated for polling problems during the 2012 election. Suspect in terrorism case wants home detention in Georgia Suspect in terrorism case wants home detention in Georgia ATLANTA (AP) - A man accused of helping to provide financial support to an al-Qaida leader wants a judge to allow him to live with relatives in Georgia while he awaits trial. Lawyers for Asif Ahmed Salim say in court records that his sister-in-law, Gwinnett County Assistant District Attorney Sabrina Nizam, has agreed to monitor his activities if a judge allows him to be placed on home detention in Duluth, Georgia. Salim is a former Ohio State University student. He is jailed and faces trial in federal court in Ohio. Salim’s attorneys deny his involvement in what prosecutors say was an effort to raise money for the late Anwar al-Awlaki, who was linked to planning several attacks against Americans. A U.S. drone strike killed Al-Awlaki in Yemen in 2011. Man arrested in shooting death of Wal-Mart security guard Man arrested in shooting death of Wal-Mart security guard LILBURN, Ga. (AP) - Authorities say a man has been arrested in the death of a security guard who was fatally shot outside a metro Atlanta Wal-Mart. Lilburn police said in a statement Tuesday that 37-year-old Boaz Anthony Fordyce is charged with murder, aggravated assault and theft by shoplifting in the death of 25-year-old Jaseramie Dion "JD’’ Ferguson. Ferguson was shot Sunday night when he and another guard approached a man who was attempting to steal three televisions from the Lilburn store. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (http://on-ajc.com/1VNLd8V ) reports that Ferguson was a married father of three. Gwinnett County jail records say Fordyce is being held without bond. It’s unclear if he has an attorney. Police investigate traffic stop shooting on interstate Police investigate traffic stop shooting on interstate LITHONIA, Ga. (AP) - Authorities say a man is in stable condition after being shot by police during a traffic stop on a metro Atlanta freeway. Officials from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation say the shooting happened Tuesday morning on Interstate 20 in the Lithonia area, just east of Atlanta. GBI spokeswoman Nelly Miles says 22-year-old Diondre David Evans was being sought in connection with a domestic violence incident in Conyers and was wanted for battery, trespassing and obstructing a 911 call. Officials say a police officer and a Rockdale County sheriff’s deputy pulled Evans over after an alert was issued for him and the deputy used his Taser when Evans resisted. Miles says Evans continued moving his car forward and the officer shot Evans. Evans was wounded in his arm and neck and the GBI is investigating. Former police officer sentenced on child molestation charges Former police officer sentenced on child molestation charges DECATUR, Ga. (AP) _ DeKalb County prosecutors say a former metro Atlanta police officer has been sentenced on child molestation charges. DeKalb County District Attorney’s spokesman Marcus Garner said in a statement that 58-year-old Kelless Twohearts Lory was sentenced to life in prison Tuesday. Prosecutors say Lory had worked as a police officer in Chamblee and for Atlanta’s public transit authority. Officials say he molested a 9-year-old family member between 2011 and 2012. Lory was found guilty of two counts of child molestation and two counts of aggravated child molestation last week. Five charged in death of Bibb Sheriff’s Office warrant clerk Five charged in death of Bibb Sheriff’s Office warrant clerk MACON, Ga. (AP) - Bibb County grand jurors have indicted five people in the fatal shooting of a Bibb County Sheriff’s Office clerk last year. The Macon Telegraph (http://bit.ly/23DfYzZ ) reports that 20-year-old Jadarien Shamar Flowers, 19-year-old Michael Dewayne Hardy Jr., 22-year-old Curtis Dewayne Jackson Jr., a 17-year-old and a 16-year-old boy were indicted Tuesday on charges of malice murder, violation of Georgia’s Street Gang Terrorism and Prevention Act and two counts of felony murder. Investigators say 23-year-old Vernard Mays of Macon was fatally shot last October while answering the door at his home. Authorities say the suspects were trying to retrieve guns they had hidden near Mays’ home. Authorities have said they don’t believe the slaying was related to Mays’ job as a clerk in the warrant division of the Sheriff’s office. × Post a comment Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.

Xiaomi’s new Mi Box set-top streamer comes with freebies Louis Ramirez Digital TrendsOctober 12, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Xiaomi's Mi Box Android TV media streamer is here to shake up the industry. For just $69, it offers high-end features like 4K HDR support. Currently for sale at Walmart, the Mi Box comes bundled with generous Vudu, Sling TV, and Pandora credits.More Media streamers are ubiquitous these days and thanks to companies like Roku, Apple, and Amazon it’s easy to find a streamer for every budget. However, Xiaomi is hoping to shake things up with its new $69 Mi Box Android TV. Currently available at Walmart, it comes bundled with a generous Sling TV, Vudu, and Pandora credit that practically pays for the device itself. It’s a pretty great deal, and we like Android TV. If you’re not familiar with Xiaomi, it’s one of the largest smartphone manufacturers in the world and renowned for offering high-end devices at very affordable prices. Back in June of 2015, the Chinese company launched its first U.S.-based online shopping portal and just this past summer, it announced it would soon enter the U.S. smartphone market. However, before launching its first U.S. smartphone, Xiaomi has decided to release the Mi Box Android TV set-top media streamer. This Android-based box gives popular streamers from the likes of Roku and Amazon a serious run for their money. Like many of today’s high-end streamers, the Mi Box Android TV supports 4K Ultra HD resolution. After a quick software update to Android Nougat, the Mi Box will also support high dynamic range (HDR) imaging at 60 frames per second, as well as Dolby Digital Plus and DTS Surround Sound. By comparison, Roku’s newest top-of-the-line streamer, the Roku Ultra, sells for a significantly higher $130. Meanwhile, the streamer closest to the Mi Box, the Roku Premiere, sells for $80, but doesn’t offer HDR support. The Mi Box is powered by Android 6.0 and offers support for voice commands and Google Cast. The latter feature means it’ll cast onto your HDTV whatever video is playing on your Android smartphone or tablet. Powering Xiaomi’s streamer is a quad-core CPU coupled with 2GB of RAM, 8GB of storage space, and a Mali 450 GPU. There’s support for the usual apps like Netflix and YouTube and you can also download and play games from the Google Play Store. An optional Mi Game Controller lets you turn your Mi Box into a makeshift gaming’console. Currently, this Mi Box bundle is only available via Walmart and it includes a $5 movie credit from Vudu, a $50 Sling TV credit (it requires that you pre-pay three months of Sling TV), and a three-month Pandora trial. Xiaomi’s Mi Box Android TV streaming box is now available in the U.S. Roku revamps entire line, adds 4K HDR models, stick-on form factor, $30 Express Xiaomi poised to enter U.S. market in October with Android TV-powered 4K Mi Box Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next “This campaign was never about you”: A former Hillary Clinton staffer on the candidate’s powerful legacy Quartz iOS 10 Hidden Feature: The Magnifier Yahoo Tech Donald Trump tells “60 Minutes” he won’t take a salary as US president Quartz New hybrid console takes Nintendo on the go Yahoo Tech Watch a Tesla Model S P100D race against a $265,000 McLaren 650S Spider BGR News This smart crib will help your baby sleep safely through the night Yahoo Tech PewDiePie Is the Most Popular YouTube Star in the World.

Staples Tumbles to Near 20-Year Low in Wake of Failed Merger The Street 10/12/2016 Brian Sozzi © Spencer Platt/Getty Images Pedestrians pass a Staples store in New York City. Staples fell to lowest in almost 20 years on Tuesday as the office-supply giant closes stores and watches its customers patronize online rivals. Quotes in the article Office Depot Inc ODP ▼ 4.15 -0.07 -1.66% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 739.01 -3.37 -0.45% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 71.23 -0.16 -0.22% Shares fell to $7.75, the lowest since December 1997, and are now down about 19% so far this year. Over the past year, Staples' stock had shed an astounding 36% compared a 6.6% gain for the S&P 500. Enthusiasm on Wall Street is hard to find in the wake of Staples' failed bid earlier in the year to merge with smaller rival Office Depot . The aftermath has left it vulnerable to growing competition from Amazon , Walmart and others in office supplies. As a result of that vulnerability, Staples' recent ugly financial performances may worsen. Staples saw same-store sales at its more than 1,600 stores in the U.S. and Canada fall 4% in the second quarter. Execs pinned the blame on weak store traffic. Operating income for the North America stores segment fell 57% year over year to $12 million. Sales plunged in tablets, tech accessories, ink, toner and office supplies. To add insult to injury, same-store sales for Staples.com rose a meager 1%. Sales for the company's North American commercial segment, which ships office supplies to businesses, fell 0.2% in the second quarter vs. a year earlier. Staples found the most success in promotional products, facilities supplies, and breakroom supplies, partially offset by declines in ink and toner, and paper. Staples will close 46 to 50 stores in North America this year, as it attempts to slash costs and restore investor confidence. It has closed more than 300 stores since 2011.

“No warning can save people determined to grow suddenly rich” – Lord Overstone Home Articles Authors Email Groups Search About Us HOME / Articles / Gordon Long / Are Central Bankers Crippling The Global Supply Ch... Are Central Bankers Crippling The Global Supply Chain? By: Gordon Long | Wed, Oct 12, 2016 Share Print Email Samsung's Galaxy Battery Just the Tip of the Iceberg Though the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 battery problem is presently receiving a tremendous amount of media and public attention, what few appreciate is that it is only the tip of the iceberg of cracks in the global supply chained as a result of unintended consequences of central bank monetary policies. In this 35 minute video Gordon T Long and Charles Hugh Smith begin 'pealing the onion' on a deteriorating global supply chain and what the root cause is. Economists have been preoccupied since the 2008 Financial Crisis with stimulating economic growth through policies which attempt to create Demand. It is debatable whether these Keynesian stimulus programs have succeeded, but what isn't debatable is that cheap money has exploded global supply! Peak Profits Though Corporate Profits are presently at all time highs, revenue growth and margins are rolling over and cashflows are falling. This has been placing incredible pressures through out the global supply chain. It is resulting in deteriorating product quality when considered in light of total cost of ownership and whether the customer is actually getting more for less or whether they are now receiving less for more! What We Can Learn From Walmart, Wells Fargo and Peak Profits The pressures big distribution players like Wal-Mart are placing on global product suppliers is well recognized. What is less recognized is how internal cultures are changing due to increasing pressures and demands. This issue has received the glare of the public spotlight through the deviant behavior of Wells Fargo. What we witnessed during testimony before congress because of the fraudulent creation of thousands of fictional accounts and the resulting firing of thousands of apparent guilty parties is that the top down pressures by executives to meet unrealistic goals is causing workers at all levels to "cheat"! Senior executives are fired for not meeting quarterly financial goals even if the economy is slowing and profits are at historic levels. Something has to give somewhere and that "give" is occurring in the hidden bowels of product quality. Deteriorating Quality Gordon's background allows him to critically examine the quality issues he has personally experienced over the last 6 weeks and what these examples are indicating. The examples highlighted include: Marine Propulsion Automotive Repair Dell Hard Drives and HP NIC Cards Gas Range Lighting Healthcare TV Programming The conclusion is that this is only the initial waves of more to come. In a conversation Gordon had with the head of Global Supply Chain for a major corporation he was told that focus had been taken off this critical area over the last few years but was now being urgently attended to. Samsung has added additional urgency as the public and regulators will be intolerant the next time such an event occurs.. Pushing Costs To The Unsuspecting The cost of poor quality is now being pervasively felt across the entire supply chains. It beginning to reach out and impact all participants. It like a cancer which growths quietly and often it is to late when finally detected.

Much of the school library's collection remains with the property. Comfortable, modern furnishings chosen to compliment the home's unique features. John Hudson Thomas's favored square patterns shine through the atrium skylight, surrounded by his signature starburst pattern. spring mansion in berkeley, CA Neutral carpeting and paint make what could have been an intimidating room a more approachable one. Previous Next The Spring Mansion in Berkeley, CA, isn't just a home -- it's also a piece of history and a work of art. Modeled on an empress' palace and offering breathtaking views of San Francisco Bay, the estate is "like a Picasso -- you're not just going to walk in and buy one at Wal-Mart," according to listing agent Herman Chan. With a price tag of $7.5 million, it'll require a buyer who doesn't rely on everyday low prices. For the price, a buyer isn't getting merely a 12,000-square-foot mansion -- the mansion is also a time capsule with ties to a progressive school for children, a liberal arts college, and a couple of millionaires. Built in 1912, the mansion still needs a few interior tweaks. It's had only four owners, but the search for a fifth has had its challenges. Chan and his crew polished up the property to bring it into the 21st century while highlighting its unique background. Selling a bit of history Chan saw the house languish on the market as other agents struggled to find a buyer. He knew that this unique property needed equally unique marketing. "It's not just a house. It's one of a kind. There's nothing else like it in the world," said Chan. "You have to give it enough spin, glamour, and PR to justify its price." The marketing campaign features a website, a book, and wider outreach. "We've been getting inquiries from abroad, especially China, for trophy properties," he said. "Even tech incubators have been calling us about maybe transforming this into a school or a conference center." In fact, the Spring Mansion was an institution for far longer than a residence. Built for real estate mogul John Hopkins Spring by architect John Hudson Thomas, whose grand homes still dot the Berkeley hills, the mansion was modeled on Empress Elizabeth of Austria's Achilleion Palace. The architect's trademark designs are still visible throughout the mansion, from the four-square pattern and starbursts on the front door and the atrium skylight to the fireplace carvings and the terraces surrounding the mansion. Spring didn't stay in his custom-built mansion for long. He lived there less than a year before the estate found itself in the hands of a pioneering educator, Cora Williams, who offered a holistic, creative take on children's education. After her death, the home became a liberal arts college. After serving 50 years as a school, the mansion became home to yet another real estate mogul in the '70s. He made changes to the interior, though his handiwork included a few unfortunate design choices inspired by the times -- like its red and orange interior paint. Luckily, the exterior remained untouched and the mansion wound up becoming a city landmark in 2000. The mansion was sold again in 2005, but the owner soon left for Los Angeles and put the estate back up for sale. It has since bounced on and off the market. Staging for a modern buyer Chan knew he couldn't take on this project alone. Cora Sue Anthony, a home stager whose work has been featured on HGTV, saw the Spring Mansion as a grand dame in need of a makeover. "The trick was, how do you keep the integrity of the house but make it so that anyone can live here?" Anthony says. "Staging is like makeup. You want a nice foundation to highlight certain features, but you don't want to be clownish." The gaudy interior paint was replaced with neutral tones that allowed the home's underlying features to shine. The red carpet that covered the grand staircase was replaced with a neutral-colored quatrefoil pattern, which meshes well with the existing design elements while offering a modern touch. While some of the mansion's carpeting and upholstery was ravaged over the decades and had to be replaced, museum pieces such as the medieval wall tapestries in the living room had survived for over a century in excellent condition. Anthony's other major task was to furnish rooms without making the home feel stuffy. "We went for comfortable furniture that still kept the integrity of the house's history. We used lighter woods and fabrics to contrast with the dark wood of the walls instead of competing," Anthony explains. "Above all, we didn't want to go too formal. It has to be livable." Will their work pay off? Only time will tell if this new makeover and marketing campaign will work, but Chan seems optimistic. The mansion has a chance to stay true to its roots and become the residence of another local mogul or the home of another school. Or perhaps it'll move in an entirely different direction. Either way, the Spring Mansion is ready for the 21st century.

Ohio man charged with molesting teen in Shelbyville hotel Holly V. Hays , holly.hays@indystar.com 9:47 p.m. EDT October 12, 2016 Cory Hockaday (Photo: Provided) An Ohio man was arrested last week after police say he met with a 13-year-old girl in a Shelbyville hotel room and had sex with her. On Oct. 7, Cory Hockaday, 23, of Toledo, Ohio, took a bus from Cincinnati to Indianapolis, then took a cab to Shelbyville to meet a girl he had met on Facebook, according to court documents. He initially tried to pick up the girl from her middle school, telling school staff he was the girl's older brother. He was turned away from the school, and officials contacted the girl's mother, who tried to call her daughter but could not get an answer. When the pair met, they "hung out" for a while, the girl told police, going first to Wal-Mart, Kroger and Taco Bell before going back to the hotel room. Both the girl and Hockaday admitted to having sex at the hotel, police said. The girl told police she took a shower, after which, she said, Hockaday entered the Wi-Fi password in her phone. That's when she received the messages from friends and family asking where she was. She called her mother and told her where they were. Hockaday told police he and the girl had met a year before on Facebook and that he knew she was 12 when they started talking, but that he "fell in love" with her while chatting via social media and Skype. Hockaday was charged with one count of child molesting, a Level One felony. Call IndyStar reporter Holly Hays at (317) 444-6156. Follow her on Twitter: @hollyvhays.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Busy multi-tenant retail pad in Hesperia sold for millions Wednesday Oct 12, 2016 at 4:43 PM Oct 12, 2016 at 4:43 PM Rene Ray De La Cruz Staff Writer @DP_ReneDeLaCruz HESPERIA — The Hanley Investment Group Real Estate Advisors recently announced the firm represented a buyer and seller in the off-market sale of a $8.5 million multi-tenant retail pad. Located in the Hesperia Marketplace Shopping Center — the home of the Wal-Mart Supercenter — the 13,940-square-foot pad, with two buildings, is located on the southeast corner of Escondido Avenue and Main Street. Built in 2015, one multi-tenant building is occupied by national and regional tenants, including Pieology Pizzeria, The Habit Burger Grill, Firehouse Subs, Yogurtland, Great Clips, Nutrishop and Metro PCS. The other building is home to Petco, which is located in a 10,000-square-foot building. Hanley Investment Group Executive Vice President Eric Wohl represented the seller, Pacific Development Group of Newport Beach, with Senior Vice President Patrick Kent representing the buyer, SHA Enterprises, Inc. of Irvine. “Utilizing Hanley Investment Group’s weekly strategy meeting, we leveraged our long-standing relationship with Pacific Development Group to connect a motivated 1031 exchange buyer with an off-market listing to fulfill the requirement,” said Wohl, in a company news release. “We were also able to facilitate a new corporate lease with Daniel’s Jewelers prior to closing to bring the property to 100 percent occupancy.” Kent said the buyer closed escrow in 45 days without requiring a financing contingency. He added that factors making the site appealing to the buyer included 91 percent of the building’s space was occupied by credit tenants, Walmart and Petco as anchors, the intersection location and the proximity to the Interstate 15. “Multi-tenant outparcels to big box retail is a product type that is in very high demand,” said Wohl. “This type of retail asset is a relatively low-risk option for investors due to the high-exposure location, diversity of corporate and regional tenants and a strong traffic-driving anchor like Wal-Mart. Additionally, investors can typically spread out their risk over multiple tenants versus single-tenant assets.” Rene Ray De La Cruz may be reached at 760-951-6227, RDeLa Cruz@VVDailyPress.com or on Twitter @DP_ReneDeLaCruz.

Related Coverage Grandma may be charged after 2-year-old left in hot car Grandma accused of leaving 2-year-old in hot car arraigned GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (WOOD) — A West Michigan woman has been sentenced for leaving her 2-year-old granddaughter in a hot car at a Grand Rapids-area store earlier this year. Tuesday, Karol Ann Fitzgerald was sentenced to six months of probation, WOOD Radio reports. She must also attend parenting or grandparenting classes. Fitzgerald was charged with a misdemeanor count of leaving a child in an unattended vehicle after the May incident at the Wal-Mart on Alpine Avenue in Walker. A passerby noticed the 2-year-old girl in a minivan, sweating and red-faced. A Kent County sheriff’s deputy broke one of the windows to get her out. She showed signs of heat exhaustion, but wasn’t seriously hurt. WOOD Radio says Fitzgerald said she couldn’t carry the girl or get her to wake up, so she left her in the minivan while she went into the store to shop. She is believed to have been inside for about 40 minutes. The judge told Fitzgerald, 72, that she used “extremely bad judgment.” In January 2015, Fitzgerald was accused by the federal government of creating false deductions, fake business expenses and misrepresenting income to get bigger returns for clients. Federal investigators estimate the government lost out on more than $11 million in 2010 and 2011 alone because of the fraud. She did not face any criminal charges, but the government asked a judge to bar her from preparing taxes. In November 2013, federal authorities raided Fitzgerald’s home in Cedar Springs. They took boxes and boxes of files from the unsecured house, out of which she ran her business and which was she was losing to foreclosure. When Target 8 went to the house the weeks after the feds, we found tax documents that were left behind in burn barrels and scattered around the yard. Fitzgerald told Target 8 that she thought her son had burned all the files. Target 8 called authorities, who later collected the documents.
