Brent Wilmot helps 11-year-old Claremont Middle School student Lacey Laroche look for a gift for a family member Tuesday during the police department's "Shop With a Cop" program at Walmart. — CAMERON PAQUETTECLAREMONT — Area police were out in force at Walmart for all the right reasons Tuesday night as they helped upward of 60 area children find and purchase Christmas gifts for their loved ones. For the first time in eight years, the Claremont Police Department have brought back the department’s “Shop With a Cop” program, which allows less fortunate elementary school students to purchase gifts for the family with the assistance of a local police officer while their parents wait at the front of the store. Student Resource Officer Crystal Simonds and Claremont Police Lt. Stan Andrews put their heads together to re-launch the program after it had ceased eight years ago due to funding issues. “It’s something we used to do every single year,” said Simonds, who has worked with the police department for 18 years. The Windsor Police Department was also on hand at Walmart Tuesday night for that department’s 2nd annual Shop With a Cop. Windsor Police Chief William Sampson said the event is a good opportunity for kids who might find themselves in a less-than-fortunate position in the holidays. “We look at families that are having a tough time,” he said. “We try to target those kids to let them buy something they may not have.” He said that last year’s event was funded through the police department, but that this year the money raised for the event was “100 percent donated” Windsor Police Det. Jennifer Frank reaches up to high-five 6-year-old Elijah Barett at Walmart during the police department's 2nd annual "Shop With a Cop" night Tuesday. — CAMERON PAQUETTESimonds said she had been trying to re-launch the program since she became student resource officer for Claremont schools three years ago, and that “this year it all just fell together.” She said 65 children in Claremont schools received invitations. Each student was assisted by a Claremont officer while they conducted their shopping at Walmart in Claremont. She said that between a $1,000 Walmart community involvement grant and donations from various charities, including the Claremont Police Association, $4,000 was raised for the children to spend. Guidance counselors in the elementary schools were asked to invite students who they thought “might need a positive moment” this holiday season, according to Simonds. She said that the number of students invited depends on the amount of money raised. “When I met with some of the families and game them invites, it was emotionally overwhelming” to see how thankful they were to be able to buy for their family members, Simonds said. With about 12 officers from Claremont, Cornish and the sheriff’s department on hand, roughly five students accompanied officers into the store to shop every 15 minutes. After cashing out at the register, each student was given a gift bag with a Walmart gift card, fruit snacks, candy canes and other holiday goodies. Simonds said that with all the “bad news” regarding police on a national level, the event is a good way to foster positive relationships between the police and the community. “It’s such  great opportunity for the kids to create a positive relationship with the the police,” she said. Lori Carrier, who brought her son, 9-year-old Disnard Elementary School student Kaden, agreed. “This is a good program for [Kaden] to have a positive experience with police,” she said.

Sayre THE BLADE Buy This Image Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print More than three dozen families this month had their holiday wishes saved at the last minute thanks to a generous donation made possible by a man who knows what it’s like to be teetering on the brink. Blessings in Disguise, a small nonprofit founded by local businessman John Sayre, paid off 39 layaway accounts at two Toledo-area Walmart stores on Dec. 12.  That date was the last day Walmart customers had to make final payments on their layaway items or have those items returned to the stores’ shelves. “A lot of people are too prideful to ask [for help.] They don’t like to tell you when they’re down and out,” Mr. Sayre said.  “An easy way for me to tell the last couple years people are struggling is when they put things on layaway, and it’s the last day, and they’re not paid off,” he said. The group declined to say how much was spent, but it was several thousand dollars, and the organization targeted layaway accounts with children’s items. Every year around Christmastime, stories pop up nationwide of kind strangers who have paid off others’ bills. Last December, Wal-Mart said an anonymous donor visited stores in Cleveland and Lorain and spent $106,000 to pay off others’ bills. This year, an anonymous donor paid off nearly $50,000 at a Walmart in Pennsylvania. Another donor spent $5,000 at a store in southwest Ohio. “When customers quietly pay off others’ layaway items, we’re reminded how good people can be,” the company said in a statement. “The joy that comes from these transactions extends well beyond dollars and cents. We’re honored to be a small part of these random acts of kindness.” In the case of Mr. Sayre, he’s making good on a promise he made to himself years ago. After a swindling venture capital fund drained his bank accounts, Mr. Sayre found himself penniless but unable to find much help because, on paper, he made too much money. He vowed that when he was able, he would start a nonprofit aimed at helping people who didn’t qualify for government assistance but nevertheless needed help. Blessings in Disguise, which received its 501(c)3 status in 2014, is targeted at northwest Ohio individuals who make more than $24,500 and families making more than $42,500, who are receiving unemployment compensation, workers’ compensation, or short-term disability, but no government benefits. “I was in their shoes. I fit that profile, and I couldn’t get assistance,” Mr. Sayre said. “So I vowed one day that when I could I would create the plan and the vision to create that group that would help them. And that’s really how the mission started.” Though the organization usually does in-depth screening of everyone it helps, it broadens its reach at Christmas. At Walmart, the group took any unpaid layaway in which 95 percent of the items are clearly for children. “We try to focus on the kids, because that’s what it’s about,” he said. Though Wal-Mart officials didn’t know of any other similar acts in the Toledo area, employees at two area Kmart stores reported several instances in which someone offered to anonymously pay off a layaway tab. Samantha Nicholson, the layaway manager at Kmart on Alexis Road, said one customer noticed a pile of items, including many toys, that were destined to go back on the store shelves because the amount still owed hadn’t been paid on time. When the customer learned the items had been on layaway but weren’t paid in full, she asked if she could pay the tab herself. “I pulled from the list of people who made partial payments or some payments but couldn’t make them all, and she paid on three of them,” Ms. Nicholson said. Officials at both stores said about five people had offered to pay this year. “It’s very emotional,” Ms. Nicholson said. Contact Tyrel Linkhorn at tlinkhorn@theblade.com or 419-724-6134.

(cleveland.com file photo) Print Email Cliff Pinckard, cleveland.com By Cliff Pinckard, cleveland.com The Plain Dealer Email the author | Follow on Twitter on December 21, 2016 at 4:21 AM, updated December 21, 2016 at 4:53 AM comments ITHACA, New York -- A man accused of killing a UPS driver outside a Walmart earlier this month said during a court appearance that he believes he killed president-elect Donald Trump, reports say. Police say Justin Barkley, 38, of Dryden, N.Y., shot and killed William Schumacher, 52, of Candor, N.Y., on Dec. 8. in a Walmart parking lot, then ran over Schumacher with his vehicle. He later fired at police officers and was arrested after an eight-hour standoff at his home. According to the Ithaca Voice, Barkley said during his court appearance that he staked out the Walmart because he knew Trump would be there. "I shot and killed Donald Trump purposely, intentionally and very proudly," Barkley said, according to the Voice. "I went there to purposely shoot and kill him and put him down." Barkley reportedly said he could not be convinced that he had not killed anyone other than Trump. Barkley attempted to plead guilty to second-degree murder and menacing a police officer or peace officer, but Tompkins County Court Judge John Rowley rejected the plea, instead ordering Barkley be evaluated to determine whether he is competent to stand trial, the Ithaca Journal reports. Barkley's next court appearance is scheduled for Jan. 6. According to the Journal, Schumacher was a seasonal UPS driver who had stopped at the Walmart to get something to eat during his overnight shift. Schumacher was shot at about 1 a.m. Barkley is a former social worker at St. Lawrence Psychiatric Center and also worked at the Office of Children and Family Services' Finger Lakes Residential Center, North Country Now reports. He was not employed at either facility at the time of the shooting. If you would like to comment on this story, please visit cleveland.com's crime and courts comments section.

However, while Walmart did heed to that particular request, it refused to remove other “Black Lives Matter” clothing, a demand that was put forth by FOP President Chuck Canterbury in his letter sent to Walmart on Tuesday. "Black Lives Matter” is a slogan and an international protest movement that began after the death of Trayvon Martin. It campaigns against violence and systemic racism toward black people. The movement is considered to target law enforcement and has inspired a counter pro-police movement called “Blue Lives Matter. The pulled off clothing say “Bulletproof” with “Black Lives Matter” beneath that line. In an article titled “Walmart Selling Black Lives Matter Shirts with ‘Bulletproof’ on Them” posted last week, Breitbart.com, the news organization known for its far-right views, directed attention toward Walmart and characterized the “Black Lives Matter” movement as a “hate or terrorist effort.” It also incorrectly stated that the "questionable" merchandise was being sold by Walmart when in fact it was being sold on Walmart’s website by Old Glory Merchandise, a Connecticut-based music and entertainment apparel dealer. In his letter addressed to Walmart CEO C. Douglas McMill, Canterbury advised the former to refrain from was selling “offensive shirts and sweatshirts.” Canterbury also accused the "third party" of  “profiting from racial division." “I urge you to prohibit the use of the Walmart name and website for the retail sale of these products,” read the letter. Related Stories Trump Plans African-American Issues Meeting Black Lives Matter 'Indebted' To Fidel Castro Canterbury added: “I am concerned that allowing these articles to be sold in this way will damage your company’s good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers…Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another.” In response, Walmart issued a statement Tuesday night, according to Washington Post, that said: “Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter, and All Lives Matter merchandise. After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the ‘bulletproof’ reference.” Walmart has had a history of controversies regarding the sale of items and for pulling items off their shelves. For instance, back in 2006, the company was forced to reverse its policy and stock emergency contraception pills in all of its pharmacies after losing a lawsuit filed in a Massachusetts court. Another incident in 2006 that caused embarrassment to Walmart involved their retail website, which linked four films about iconic African Americans to "Planet of the Apes" and "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" through their customer recommendation system . Walmart dodged the bullet and shrugged off the criticism that called their web site racist by claiming that it was due to human error.

Harris Courtney Bissinge looks for items on the shelf while shopping at Wal-Mart as her daughter, Ember, rests in a new Caroline’s Cart, a shopping cart for special needs children, on Tuesday in Pendleton. Buy this photo The new shopping cart carrying 3-year-old Ember glided through the aisles. Mother Courtney Bissinger hadn’t found grocery shopping at the Pendleton Wal-Mart so easy in a while. Ember has seeing and hearing problems, cerebral palsy and severe neurological damage. Bissinger, 31, a Pendleton native, said pushing her daughter in a wheelchair and maneuvering a grocery cart at the same time made shopping a pain. “Not everybody has the luxury of an extra set of hands or a caregiver,” she said. “I needed something that would let me shop more than her wheelchair.” Ember’s wheelchair can accommodate only a small basket, and she is getting too big for the seat that fits into regular shopping carts. The solution was Caroline’s Cart, a shopping cart for special needs children. The six-wheeled cart has a rear-facing seat with a harness that can secure a person weighing up to 250 pounds, according to manufacturer information, while the basket is almost the size of a regular shopping cart. Bissinger said she found out about the helpful carts from friends on social media who alert her to contraptions that could make life easier for her and Ember. She shops at Wal-Mart, so several weeks ago she asked the company about getting some of the carts for the Pendleton store. Shawna Nulf has 23 years with Wal-Mart, the last five as manager of the Pendleton store. She took information from Bissinger and called the “home office” about the carts. Sure enough, the retail giant had them, and she ordered two. Nulf said she was concerned they would not arrive until after the holiday shopping season. The carts came Tuesday. “I rushed them up front,” she said. And Bissinger and Ember went shopping at noon. Nulf said the corporate motto is “Happy to help,” and the new carts meet a need in the store. Bissinger said she knows several families in Pendleton and Umatilla County could use these carts. Nulf added she would bring in more if the need increased. She said seeing Ember in the cart was good. Ember’s needs stem from congenital cytomegalovirus, or CMV. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CMV is a common virus affecting people of all ages. Once you have CMV, you always have CMV, and more than half the population over 40 has the virus. Most people with CMV show no signs or symptoms, but the virus can cause serious health problems for people with weakened immune systems and for developing babies in the womb. “I got a cold in the first couple of months of pregnancy,” Bissinger said. “It turns out it was way more than that.” Bissinger said her daughter obviously suffered from something, and local doctors did not know what. Six months after Ember was born, Bissinger said, a doctor in Portland made the diagnosis. Congenital CMV infection can cause a range of symptoms, including some worse than Ember’s. Bissinger said her daughter can express herself, enjoys the stimulation of being in public and, like any young child, can get into any mess she finds. “I consider myself lucky that she can interact and have the ability to be a wild child,” she said. She also said she hoped people would respect the new carts. Life is difficult enough, she said, and even small comforts help.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive log in weather Brockton man charged in Walmart thefts in Raynham Wednesday Dec 21, 2016 at 12:01 AM Dec 21, 2016 at 8:18 AM Sara Cline @saraclinenews RAYNHAM — The Raynham Police Department took to Twitter requesting help from the public in identifying the man who allegedly stole $2,530 worth of merchandise from Walmart — and now they have a warrant for his arrest. Raynham Police are searching for John Knapp, 37, of Brockton, whom they say stole over $2,530 worth of merchandise from the Walmart located at 36 Paramount Drive, in four separate incidents since September. Police Tweeted nine surveillance photos of the suspects stealing items from the Walmart. The Tweets were retweeted and shared by other accounts such as the Taunton Police Department. By Dec. 13, the police station received calls identifying Knapp as one of the men in the surveillance photos, Raynham Police Lieutenant David LaPlante said. Police are now actively searching for Knapp, whose last address is unknown, according to police. LaPlante said that Knapp has an arrest warrant for four counts of larceny that took place between Sept. 7 and Dec. 11 at the Walmart, which is open 24/7. According to police reports the first incident was Sept. 7 around 11 p.m., when they say Knapp and another man entered the Walmart store, went into the Garden and Lawn Center and loaded a cart with various lawn equipment, that amounted to $804 total, and then left through the garden center doors. The second incident occurred Oct. 28 around 2 a.m., when again police say Knapp and another man returned to the Garden and Lawn Center, this time stealing hand-held leaf blowers worth $234, according to LaPlante. The third and most expensive incident took place Dec. 9 at 12:45 a.m., when police say Knapp and another man stole two snow blowers, worth $597 each. LaPlante said in these three incidents, the men forced open the locked doors of the garden center, which led outside of the building, loaded the stolen equipment into a truck and drove away. LaPlante said in the third incident, the truck was described as a dark, two-door, pickup truck. It is unclear whether the second man with Knapp in these three incidents is the same person. Police say Knapp returned to the store on Dec. 11 at 3:21 a.m., but this time there was no second man on surveillance camera. LaPlante said Knapp could be seen on surveillance camera going into the garden center stealing a walk-behind lawn mower and loading it into a dark colored sedan, possibly a Nissan, LaPlante said. Police are actively searching for Knapp and further suspects have not yet been identified, LaPlante said. Knapp could be facing charges for fours counts of larceny, including three counts of larceny over $250 and one count of larceny under $250. This is an active investigation and anyone with further information about the thefts is asked to call Raynham Police at 508-824-2717.

And yet participants weren’t quite ready to sign up for any sky-is-falling thesis. “It would be better, for sure, if the Trump administration weren’t obstructionist,” said Nature Conservancy CEO Mark Tercek at the NationSwell Summit. “But we’re not doomed if that’s the case,” he continued. Why? Because giant multinational companies are now advancing sustainability agendas rooted in bottom-line concerns. Tercek took a moment to compliment not an obvious ecological champion like, say, Apple, but a corporation that hasn’t always been seen as green: “Walmart is being enormously constructive.” Not a crazy idea The idea of turning one’s environmental attention from an uninterested or unmotivated White House and instead looking to large firms with a nationwide or international scale isn’t new. Walmart (WMT) pleasantly surprised many activists during the George W. Bush administration. In 2005, then-CEO Lee Scott said that Hurricane Katrina had changed his thinking and committed the firm long-term to using 100% renewable energy, creating zero waste, and selling only sustainable products. Lee’s speech noted the underlying financial logic of these moves: “If our trucks are inefficient from a fuel standpoint, we’ll pay for that at the diesel pump.” Making Walmart’s fleet of trucks more efficient by one mile per gallon would have saved $52 million that year. Lee Scott speaking at the Fortune Brainstorm Green conference in April 2010. Source: REUTERS/Lucy NicholsonMore A 2008 report in the Stanford Social Innovation Review found that these initiatives, often done in concert with nonprofits like the Green Electronics Council and the World Wildlife Fund, both shrank Walmart’s environmental footprint and expanded its profits by chipping away at waste in its operations and those of its suppliers. Eight years later, Walmart’s 2016 “Global Responsibility Report” notes substantial progress. The company met its goal of doubling the efficiency of its US fleet by 2015, which saved 650,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide—and nearly $1 billion in expenses. (The report notes that much of this improvement was due to automated monitoring of truck drivers’ performance on the road and the resulting “well-informed conversations” management can have with them.) Walmart has yet to hit 100% renewable energy, but by reaching 25% it’s climbed well above the 9.4% average for the US in August. In November, the company said it aims to get to 50% renewable by 2025. “The things that I talked about today will be good business as well as doing good things for the world ,” Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said at a conference after announcing that and other sustainability goals. The phrase “greed is good” doesn’t appear in that 2016 Walmart document or the Stanford report, but that line from the movie “Wall Street” does apply in this case. As another NationSwell Summit speaker, Energy Independence Now executive director Brian Goldstein, said: “It’s not, ‘hey, we want to save baby seals,’ but ‘this is going to make economic sense’.” Case study: cable boxes But what about situations where the company causing the waste doesn’t have to pay for it? That was the scenario with cable boxes, which not only cost you $10 or more a month in rental fees but also have historically been energy hogs. The Natural Resources Defense Council studied the problem and found that cable and satellite boxes ate up 27 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, more than $3 billion worth, in 2010. That consumption could be cut by 30% to 50%, that nonprofit’s research found. Read More That led to a voluntary agreement to reduce TV-box energy consumption signed in late 2013 by NRDC, the Department of Energy, cable and satellite operators, set-box manufacturers and two industry groups, the Consumer Electronics Association (now the Consumer Technology Association) and the National Cable & Telecommunications Association (now NCTA – the Internet & Television Association). Three years later, that deal seems to be working. An August 2016 study found that TV-box energy use had declined by 15.9% overall, with energy use by digital video recorders—the most power-intensive kind—dropping by 36%. That initiative also led to a 2015 agreement to increase the efficiency of routers, cable modems and other home network equipment. An audit a year later found that 89.6% of the hardware models covered by this deal met its efficiency standards — though you could say that meant those goals weren’t ambitious enough. Noah Horowitz, who directs the NRDC’s Center for Energy Efficiency, credited public pressure and the cable industry’s fear of more bad PR. “This collective pressure caused the service providers and their suppliers to focus on driving down the energy use of new and existing set top boxes,” he wrote in an e-mail, noting that President Barack Obama’s administration wasn’t crucial to that success: “Under a different White House we would have likely achieved a similar outcome.” Horowitz noted that having only a few manufacturers of TV boxes made a corporate-focused strategy work. This market also allowed for a quick payback: “We were able to achieve immediate energy savings, rather than wait five plus years for a national standard to take effect.” Change is still hard Protesters in Berlin after the election of Donald Trump. Source: Sean Gallup/Getty ImagesMore It’s still important to note that Trump White House looks like to be much more hostile to energy regulations than prior administrations. Trump appointed a vocal climate-change denier, Competitive Enterprise Institute official Myron Ebell, to run the transition at the Environmental Protection Agency. And finding corporate champions will only go so far to counteract that. Besides, many attempts to push change at the corporate level still fail. The shareholder-activist group Ceres expects a record number of shareholder resolutions on climate change in 2017—200 or so, up from 174 in 2016. But a look at its list of shareholder resolutions shows that most failed, the usual fate of resolutions not backed by management. And many environmental problems—think of the long-standing problem of Chesapeake Bay pollution — result from the actions of a large group of smaller actors. That’s the sort of situation where a regulation or a tax, as ugly as it may be to those affected directly, is more effective than lobbying corporations directly. And Washington seems to have lost its appetite for those measures, at least for the next four years.

Updated: January 6, 2017 @ 6:53 pm Full Forecast News Sports Business Go! Life Buy/Sell Close AP Photo/Jae C. Hong Walmart to stop selling 'Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter' shirts after police protest By Tom Jackman • Washington Post Dec 21, 2016 (…) AP Photo/Jae C. Hong Updated at 12:38 p.m. The president of the national Fraternal Order of Police, the country's largest police organization, on Tuesday asked Walmart to stop selling T-shirts and sweatshirts which say "Black Lives Matter" and "Bulletproof" on the department store's website. On Tuesday night, Walmart said it would remove the shirts which say "Bulletproof," but not the "Black Lives Matter" shirts. "Black Lives Matter" is a slogan and protest movement which emerged after the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012 and police-involved slayings in 2014, and is seen as offensive by many in law enforcement. The website Breitbart.com posted an article last week which said that Walmart was "selling Black Lives Matter clothing and other items," though the merchandise is actually being sold through Walmart's website by Old Glory Merchandise, a music and entertainment apparel dealer out of Connecticut. Chuck Canterbury, the FOP president, wrote to Walmart CEO C. Douglas McMillon Tuesday to advise him that the Walmart website was selling "offensive shirts and sweatshirts," and "I urge you to prohibit the use of the Walmart name and website for the retail sale of these products." The Walmart site and Old Glory's site also sell "Blue Lives Matter" shirts. Canterbury said he understood that a third party was selling the merchandise, but "I am concerned that allowing these articles to be sold in this way will damage your company's good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers." Canterbury added, "Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another." "Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise," Walmart said in a statement late Tuesday. "After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the 'bulletproof' reference." The "bulletproof" shirts say "Bulletproof" with "Black Lives Matter" beneath that line. Old Glory did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Jim Pasco, the executive director of the police union in Washington, said the issue was raised by union members who felt Walmart was selling anti-police items. "There are a lot of people who feel too many guns are sold," Pasco said. "Why not speak out against things that might be seen as fomenting violence, rather than things that commit violence?" _____________________ Our earlier story, posted at 2 a.m. Wednesday.

Justin Barkley, 38, from Ithaca claimed he knew where the president-elect would be on December 8. He told the judge he then waited outside of the store where he shot a man he believed to be the billionaire - however he actually fired at 52-year-old William Schumacher. 'I shot and killed Donald Trump purposely, intentionally and very proudly,' Barkley said during his arraignment on Monday, according to the Ithaca Voice. Justin Barkley, 38, (left) is accused of of killing UPS driver William Schumacher, 52, (right) in Ithaca, New York. Barkley told a judge he killed Donald Trump during a court appearance  Police engaged Barkley in an eight-hour standoff before they arrested him after shooting Schumacher and firing at other officers. Barkley was indicted for second-degree murder and menacing a police officer. In a court hearing that appeared to make very little sense at times, Barkley told Judge John Rowley that 'he recognized the difference between mistaking a person for Trump and saying that he killed him.'

Share this article Share 1.2k shares UPS driver William Schumacher was shot outside of a Walmart after Barkley claims he thought he was Donald Trump UPS held a tribute for their fallen worker The Daily News reports how Barkley was asked whether any evidence suggested that a person he killed was not Trump, to which he answered, 'I hope not.' Judge Rowley refused to allow Barkley to enter a guilty plea stating that Barkley needed to be examined by psychiatrists to determine whether he is even capable of standing trial. That would last until February. next year. The judge said that he felt 'uncomfortable' taking Barkley's plea without having undergone psychiatric examinations first. The assessment could take place at either a mental hospital or at the jail itself.  If he does eventually stand trial and is convicted, Barkley faces 25 years to life in prison.

In the letter from Chuck Canterbury, the FOP president,to Walmart CEO C. Douglas McMillon, Canterbury said the Walmart website was selling 'offensive shirts and sweatshirts,' and urged him 'to prohibit the use of the Walmart name and website for the retail sale of these products.' The 'Black Lives Matter' protest movement emerged following the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012 and gained ground after several high-profile deaths at the hands of police 'I am concerned that allowing these articles to be sold in this way will damage your company's good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers,' he continued.  Canterbury added: 'Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another.' In a statement, Walmart said: 'Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise.  Some of the shirts carry the word 'Bulletproof' in large print with 'Black Lives Matter' written underneath The shirts are being sold by Old Glory Merchandise, a Connecticut-based music and entertainment apparel dealer RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Microsoft sparks controversy with holiday ad which promotes... Hundreds of protesters clash with riot police at Texas A&M... Share this article Share 'After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the "bulletproof" reference.'  The shirts carry the word 'Bulletproof' in large print with 'Black Lives Matter' written underneath. The shirts are being sold by Old Glory Merchandise, a Connecticut-based music and entertainment apparel dealer. After receiving the letter the retailer agreed to remove some Black Lives Matter shirts but most are still on sale Both Old Glory and Walmart's website also sell shirts with the pro-police slogan 'Blue Lives Matter'. Jim Pasco, the executive director of the police union in Washington, said union members had complained about the shirts because they felt Walmart was selling anti-police items.  'There are a lot of people who feel too many guns are sold,' Pasco told the Washington Post. 'Why not speak out against things that might be seen as fomenting violence, rather than things that commit violence?' The 'Black Lives Matter' protest movement emerged following the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012 and gained ground after several high-profile deaths at the hands of police. The 'Black Lives Matter' slogan is seen as offensive by many in law enforcement.  Read more: Walmart to stop selling ¿Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter¿ shirts after police protest - The Washington Post Share or comment on this article e-mail 91 shares Most watched News videos Dan Bilzerian show off glitzy lifestyle as 'King of Instagram' Blind man attaches GoPro to guide dog to record his commute Cyclist forced off the road by dangerous braking driver Heartbreaking moment horse cries at owner's funeral 'I thought he was going to hit me': Ann Widdecombe on Philpott Great White shark breaches the water in pursuit of a tasty treat "UFO" has been filmed demonstrating highly unusual behaviour Stepdaughter surprises stepmom with adoption papers at Christmas Meryl Streep arrives at Debbie Reynolds' and Carrie Fisher's memorial Dangling kid rescued from a ski lift at Whistler Mountain Police Video Shows Rescue Of Kidnapped Man Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds are buried together Pictured: The Fort Lauderdale 'air rage' gunman who 'argued...

(Seth Perlman/AP) BY Jason Silverstein NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday, December 21, 2016, 8:38 AM Black Lives Matter T-shirts only matter so much to Walmart. The retail chain announced Tuesday it will stopping selling a Black Lives Matter shirt on its website after the country’s largest police union demanded its removal and accused the company of “profiting from racial division.” Walmart plans to nix a shirt and hoodie that said “BULLETPROOF,” with “Black Lives Matter” written under it. The company announced no plans to pull its other Black Lives Matter merchandise. The shirt will disappear after getting targeted in a letter from the National Fraternal Order of Police, a group that has often clashed with the Black Lives Matter movement. Nation's largest police group apologizes for cop-related deaths The police group’s president, Chuck Canterbury, sent a note to Walmart Tuesday criticizing the company for selling the shirt, which he deemed “offensive.” Walmart offered it online through Old Glory Merchandise, a third-party vendor. “At a time of year when we as a nation and indeed, as a world, should be coming together in hopes of peace on Earth and goodwill toward men, these third party sellers are profiting from racial division,” Canterbury wrote. “Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another. Turning a buck on strained relationships will not contribute to the healing process.” He said he was "concerned" that selling the shirt will "damage your company's good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers."

The Bulletproof Black Lives Matter shirts were available from a vendor to the big box chain’s website. The national Fraternal Order of Police union demanded that Walmart remove the Bulletproof Black Lives Matter shirts after accusing the chain store of “profiting from racial division,” the New York Daily News reports. https://t.co/X750Ta0UFO Walmart got rid of the bulletproof blm shirts but not the rest of the #blm shirts @thebestcloser #closernation — Limpbizquick (@P90xbogie) December 21, 2016 While Walmart almost immediately removed the T-shirts and hoodies that said “BULLETPROOF” in large bold letters with “Black Lives Matter” written below it, the mega store chain has not announced any plans to discontinue the rest of its Black Lives Matter merchandise from its shelves. National Fraternal Order of Police President, Chuck Canterbury, wrote a letter to Walmart on Tuesday staunchly criticizing the store’s decision to sell the Bulletproof Black Lives Matter shirts. The shirts were offered on the chain’s website via a vendor named Old Glory Merchandise. The items pulled from Walmart are still available for sale on several websites, including Etsy and eBay, according to Law Officer. “At a time of year when we as a nation and indeed, as a world, should be coming together in hopes of peace on Earth and goodwill toward men, these third party sellers are profiting from racial division,” Canterbury said in the Walmart Black Lives Matter letter. “Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another. Turning a buck on strained relationships will not contribute to the healing process.” The police union leader also said he knows the request to pull the Black Lives Matter shirts will be “seriously considered” by Walmart officials. “I am concerned that allowing these articles to be sold in this way will damage your company’s good name among FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers,” Canterbury also said in the letter to Walmart. The Bulletproof shirts and hoodies were no longer available for purchase by the end of the same day. ‘Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter’ Clothing Pulled Off Walmart Shelves -about Time! @LadiesForTrump #BlueLivesMatter https://t.co/6gpaow5R6U — C M (@dahle44) December 21, 2016 If a customer clicks on the Bulletproof Black Lives Matter shirt or hoodie listing an error message now pops up. The message reads, “We’re having technical difficulties and are looking into the problem now.” The hoodies were reportedly selling for $36.95 each. Walmart has stated the Black Lives Matter Bulletproof shirts were being removed “after hearing complaints from customers.” Officials at the store did not address whether or not the rest of the Black Lives Matter apparel, gifts, or decor items would also be removed from their online marketplace. A quick search of the Walmart website reveals there are a plethora of “lives matter” apparel items and gear available for purchase. Customers can place items with “Black Lives Matter,” “Blue Lives Matter,” and “All Lives Matter,” slogans on them into a virtual cart and for purchase. Angst over the Bulletproof Black Lives Matter T-shirts and hoodies emerged after the Breitbart website ran an article about the items being sold last week. The Black Lives Matter (or BLM) movement and slogan began in 2012 after the death of black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida, the Washington Post notes. Activists began appearing in several major cities around the United States after police-involved shootings of young black men. The Blue Lives Matter slogans and counter-protests emerged after controversial shootings in Ferguson and Baltimore prompted rioting and nationwide media coverage. What do you think about the Walmart Black Lives Matter shirts being offered for sale and then removed?

Walmart's holiday ad begins by reminding us of something we already know: Kids love Christmas. They can't sleep. They tear their presents open like wild animals. They scream.  Adults, on the other hand, are way less keen. Christmas is stressful. It's laborious. It's expensive. And it's a minefield of actively unfun corporate holiday parties. Then the ad ramps up. "At Walmart," it tells us, "we believe grownups should have a joyful Christmas too."  How's that? we wonder. Will you dim your abrasive lights? Will you make your aisles less cluttered? Will you, at the very least, give us a flashmob?  No. None of those things. Instead, Walmart is giving us Chris Jones, a hypnotist. In "Holiday Hypnosis," by Saatchi & Saatchi New York, Jones meets various harried adults and interviews them about their favorite childhood Christmases. Then, after placing them in a trance, he gets them to relive them.  Some of the results produce major lulz—it's a vision of adults wilding out in living rooms, tearing open presents, peering up the chimney for Santa, and beating the crap out of tiny drums. But there are also touching moments, like when a woman nudges a curtain open to discover snowfall, or an older man pantomimes the act of skating over the carpet.  And there's the giggling—that cup-runneth-over, tinkling-bell sound that tickles inside you and makes one guy keel over, clutching his tummy.  We're moved, despite ourselves. And when Jones snaps them back awake, it's as if they've returned from a faraway dream—still clutching wrapping paper, or on the floor, holding a very small drumstick. This isn't the time for debating the merits of hypnosis, or for whipping out that one time you tried it to quit smoking and it didn't work. Riding the emotions that unspool here requires a certain suspension of disbelief. There's something heartbreaking about letting an adult reinhabit her 5-year-old self, then taking that memory away in a dry finger-snap.  And we're not sure how to feel when Jones shows them the weird footage of all the things they did while under the spell. As grownups, there's something foolish and embarrassing about it, a sense of being tricked into losing the narrative grip of your life just long enough for it to be recorded. Scary thoughts can seep in: If I did that and didn't know it, what else could I do? But the subjects here laugh and cry.  "I never thought I'd see that again," the older man marvels, while a younger one laughs and says, "That's the young me!"  "It's been a while since I felt like this on Christmas," a woman adds, wiping tears away.  What keeps "Holiday Hypnosis" afloat is Jones' gentle, decisive manner. You feel like you can trust him to guide you safely through the alien. But what we're left with is a feather-light sense of what it felt like to be buoyed into the promise of the holidays without having to carry it on our own backs (or pay for it with our own money).  It's a pretty memory, one that could grant us the kindness of relaxing our shoulders as we close in on Christmas: It's the last leg. Most of us have done our parts and bought the gifts, and maybe now we can just enjoy our eggnog lattés and show up smiling. Because that's what matters, right? Just being happy enough to want to remember?  "Holiday Hypnosis" concludes, "Everyone should feel like a kid at Christmas. Share a happy, healthy holiday." And while this probably won't go into the annals of best holiday executions, it's at least reminded us that the kid we thought we'd grown out of is still in there somewhere, looking for Santa.

And while this probably won't go into the annals of best holiday executions, it's at least reminded us that the kid we thought we'd grown out of is still in there somewhere, looking for Santa.

The website Breitbart.com posted an article last week which said that Walmart was “selling Black Lives Matter clothing and other items,” though the merchandise is actually being sold by Old Glory Merchandise, a music and entertainment apparel dealer out of Connecticut. Chuck Canterbury, the FOP president, wrote to Walmart CEO C. Douglas McMillon Tuesday to advise him that the Walmart website was selling “offensive shirts and sweatshirts,” and “I urge you to prohibit the use of the Walmart name and website for the retail sale of these products.” The Walmart site and Old Glory’s site also sell “Blue Lives Matter” shirts. Canterbury said he understood that a third party was selling the merchandise, but “I am concerned that allowing these articles to be sold in this way will damage your company’s good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers.” Canterbury added, “Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another.” Walmart and Old Glory did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday evening. Jim Pasco, the executive director of the police union in Washington, D.C., said the issue was raised by union members who felt Walmart was selling anti-police items. “There are a lot of people who feel too many guns are sold,” Pasco said. “Why not speak out against things that might be seen as fomenting violence, rather than things that commit violence?” Walmart removed the  Black Lives Matter T-shirts after the country’s largest police union objected to the apparel it deemed highly offensive.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson    5388513 Walmart will remove some of its Black Lives Matter-inspired clothing after facing pressure from the nation’s largest police organization. Walmart announced Tuesday it will no longer feature “Bulletproof” sweatshirts on its website after receiving a letter from the Fraternal Order of Police’s president, reports the IBTimes. The sweatshirts have “Black Lives Matter” written underneath “Bulletproof.” “Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise. After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the ‘bulletproof’ reference,” the company said in a statement. Chuck Canterbury, FOP’s president, warned the company from “profiting from racial division” in the letter. “At a time of year when we as a nation and indeed, as a world, should be coming together in hopes of peace on Earth and goodwill toward men, these third party sellers are profiting from racial division,” he declared. He also admonished the company from “commercializing our differences.” “Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another. Turning a buck on strained relationships will not contribute to the healing process,” he wrote. The shirts in question are made by a company called Old Glory Merchandise; Walmart features Old Glory’s clothing on its website. Walmart features other “Black Lives Matter” clothing, but has not said whether it will stop selling those. Follow Amber on Twitter Send tips to [email protected] .

After all, the real idea is find those companies with wide moats that offer steadily rising revenues and profits. Ultimately, those steady profits result in higher dividend payouts year in and year out. And when it comes to dividend stocks, retail kingpin Walmart Stores, Inc. (WMT) has already proven itself to be worthy of income investor’s portfolios. But WMT’s past history isn’t the only reason why dividend investors should be seriously considering Walmart stock. Recent moves will continue to keep the profits and revenues flowing at the retailing giant. Not to mention, fight off rivals in faster growing market segments. In the end, WMT has the goods to keep its payout going and growing into the future. By Aaron Levitt | December 2016 This slide show is from InvestorPlace, not the Kiplinger editorial staff. 1 2 3 4 5 Slide Show 2 of 5 Practical Advice from 3 Reasons Walmart Stock Is Still a Dividend Champ Walmart Stock and Its Massive Moat     Random Retail via Flickr If you took Target Corporation’s (TGT), Costco Wholesale Corporation’s (COST) and Amazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN) total revenues and added them up, you still wouldn’t come close to the number of sales Walmart had last fiscal year. For Wally World and its 11,500-plus stores worldwide, that total came in at a staggering $482 billion worth of sales. That’s right — nearly a half a trillion dollars. WMT is simply the world’s largest retailer. But it’s not just sheer volume of sales that makes Walmart stock a great dividend play. It’s how it generates those sales that is the impressive thing. The key comes down to WMT’s product mix. Sam Walton’s concept of the supercenter — being a one-stop shop for consumers — is continuing to pay-off big time. WMT offers a wide range of items. That includes consumer staples like toilet paper and dish soap to consumer discretionary purchases like televisions and toys. The duality of that product mix allows Walmart stock to benefit in both good times and during bad. Consumer staples tend to lead in any environment. After all, you still need to wash your hair or do the dishes even if the economy is taking a beating. And when things are great, consumers head on over to the other side of the aisle and snag-up a karaoke machine or two. The steadiness of the staples combined with the extra boosts form the discretionary items have continued to help WMT push up its revenues over its history. While cost cutting and focus on margins have helped boost Walmart’s profits. Overall, they’ve helped Walmart stock become a great income play. (The current dividend yield is 2.8%.) WMT declared its first dividend back in 1974 and it has managed to increase its annual cash dividend every single year since then. That 42 years of unbroken increases has been driven by the constant growth and steady sales portfolio SEE ALSO FROM KIPLINGER: 8 Best 'YARP' Stocks for Dividend Investors 1 2 3 4 5 Slide Show 3 of 5 Practical Advice from 3 Reasons Walmart Stock Is Still a Dividend Champ The Massive Future for Walmart Stock     Mike Mozart via Wikipedia And if history is any sort of guide, then WMT’s future as a dividend champion is almost assured. That’s because the world’s largest retailer is taking the steps to combat a growing threat and remove problems with its stores. The obvious threat is the continued growth in e-commerce. It’s no secret that Amazon and other online retailers are starting to eat brick-n-mortar’s lunch when it comes to sales. Even Walmart has felt the heat in recent years. Last year, WMT’s annual sales shrank for the first time since it went public. But the world’s largest retailer isn’t taking that lying down. Walmart has undergone a massive e-commerce transformation. That transformation started with a selection of apps, in-store logistics upgrades and a massive $3 billion purchase of Jet.com. Jet, which is the brain-child of online pioneer Marc Lore, uses various algorithms that reduces prices based on shipping location and quantity. The buyout was designed to complement Walmart’s own mantra of low prices. And it seems to be working. During WMT’s most recent earnings report, online sales jumped a solid 20.6%. And in only its second holiday season as a company, Jet.com has experienced torrid growth under Walmart. Over the critical Black Friday weekend, Jet sales and traffic rose over 300% and the average order was 19% higher in terms of dollar amount. That’s just the right amount of growth to power Walmart stock ahead. And while e-commerce is clearly the future, WMT isn’t relaxing on its steady stream of store revenues either. Walmart has announced that it plans on investing around $2.7 billion into its employees. This includes higher wages, better training and customer service focuses. That’s a page directly right out of Costco’s playbook. The idea is to drive the in-store experience and make Walmart the only place consumer’s shop — online or in person. Like its e-commerce efforts, this store focus is also working with both traffic and sales up in the recent quarter.

Slow, but steady growth from its massive footprint of retail space will continue to provide plenty of cash flows over multiple economic cycles. Meanwhile, its effort on the digital front will provide plenty of extra boosts and help platform the very distant future. And given that initiatives are actually working, as evident by rising sales and visitor traffic, Walmart has the goods to keep powering its dividend further. Even more so when you consider that WMT stock features a low payout ratio of just 50%. That gives it plenty of time to make sure its commence and store plans really start working. For investors, that means Walmart’s status as a Dividend Aristocrat is pretty safe.

The protest shirts in question are sold through Walmart’s website by Old Glory Merchandise. Tee-shirts that say simply “Black Lives Matter” as well as “Blue Lives Matter” and “All Lives Matter” are also available on the website. FOP president Chuck Canterbury wrote to Walmart’s CEO complaining that the shirts would “damage” the company’s “good name” among law enforcement officers. “Commercializing our differences,” he wrote, “will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another.” On Tuesday night, Walmart responded with a statement explaining, “Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise. After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the ‘bulletproof’ reference.” [Washington Post] Read Next Your browser is out of date.

The retailer said it is removing the “Bulletproof” shirts, but not its other “Black Lives Matter” shirts, the Washington Post reports. Last week, Breitbart published an article saying that “Walmart is selling Black Lives Matter clothing and other items.” According to the Post, the merchandise is only sold on the retailer’s website through a Connecticut music and apparel company. On Tuesday, Chuck Canterbury, the president of the National Fraternal Order of Police, wrote to Walmart’s CEO, C. Douglas McMillon, urging him to “prohibit the use of the Walmart name and website for the retail sale of these products.” Per the Post: Canterbury said he understood that a third party was selling the merchandise, but “I am concerned that allowing these articles to be sold in this way will damage your company’s good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers.” Canterbury added, “Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another.” On Tuesday night, Walmart said in a statement, “Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise.

About 11 firefighters from the two departments visited Walmart on Dec. 20 and shopped with 20 kids from the community. Sheryl Sabo-Grieve says it's fabulous watching firefighters save Christmas for kids at the Jackson Interfaith Shelter, 414 S. Blackstone St. But she makes sure everybody understands they save more than that. "It's just a great way that these guys reach out into the community and help out," said Sabo-Grieve, the shelter's meal volunteer coordinator. A Salvation Army employee drove kids from the shelter to Walmart, and some other independent families were invited as well. The shopping trip was the Jackson Fire Department's 10th and Summit Township Fire Department's fourth year. "The guys really like this," said Tim Gonzales, Jackson firefighter. "The kids shop for themselves, sometimes for their parents and the money comes from collections throughout the year. It's all from the guys and Walmart gave some gift cards." Vicky Strobel is a Walmart customer service manager. She got involved in these types of shopping trips 13 years ago and hasn't looked back. "We cry a lot," Strobel said. "It makes your heart feel good." And while it makes the kids and Walmart employees feel good, the firefighters get just as much out of it, Summit Township Fire Lt. Aaron Osburn said. "It's a lot of fun, we enjoy it," Osburn said. "The kids have fun but I think we have an equal amount." Summit Township Fire Capt. Scott Stoker had a blast shopping. The kid he was partnered with got a giant stuffed animal and red flowers. "It's just great to come out," Stoker said. "We serve them every day, but it's fortunate that we can come in and help them out."

Published Dec 21st, 2016 11:20 am ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas A recent survey from Prosper Insight & Analytics of nearly 7,000 U.S. adults shows that 26.2% of holiday shoppers bought gifts from Amazon this year, increasing from 10% of respondents surveyed this time last year. “Amazon.com will be the Grinch who stole Christmas from competing retailers this year,” Pam Goodfellow of Prosper Insights noted in a recent blog post. Goodfellow said Wal-Mart Stores ranks in second place with holiday shoppers at 14.5%. Competitors like Target, Kohl’s, Best Buy, JCPenney, Toys R Us and Costco had single digit percentage shares, according to the Prosper data. She said this is the third consecutive holiday season Amazon has won the biggest share of online holiday shoppers. Goodfellow said Wal-Mart has lost share since 2013. “Walmart has realized a 3-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of -13.9% to Amazon’s +15.2%. Consequently, Amazon has been steadily increasing the gap between it and Walmart, which is at nearly 12 percentage points this year,” Goodfellow notes. “It appears that Walmart still hasn’t figured out how to address the Amazon challenge.” It should come as no surprise to see Amazon pick up online holiday share, given that an estimated 50% of U.S. households hold Amazon Prime memberships, costing a minimum of $100 annually, which gets them two-day shipping on most products. Amazon customers do overlap with Wal-Mart customers. Cowen & Co estimates that 42% of Amazon Prime members are also Wal-Mart shoppers, compared with just 20% in 2013. Annibal Sodero, assistant professor at the University of Arkansas, said Amazon attracts shoppers to its ecosystem with subscriptions like Prime. Estimates are that 55% of online consumers search Amazon first, surpassing Google this year. U.S. shoppers spent about 30% of their online time at Amazon.com, compared to 3% at Walmart.com. He has said online there is no comparison between Amazon and Walmart.com. However, the vast majority of retail sales this holiday season will happen in brick and mortar stores. The National Retail Federation estimates retail sales in November and December (excluding autos, gas and restaurants) will increase 3.6% to $655.8 billion. Online sales are forecast to increase between 7% and 10% over last year to as much as $117 billion. Wal-Mart also is a retailer with more than 4,000 stores and the largest grocer in the nation with a logistics operation which could give it an advantage over companies like Amazon now attempting online grocery. Analysts don’t expect online sales to outpace store sales any time soon. But some categories like apparel are moving in that direction. Amazon expects this year it will sell more apparel than Wal-Mart and by 2018 it will be the second largest seller of consumables such as laundry detergent and toilet paper. Wal-Mart threw a wrench in expectations when it acquired Jet.com for $3.3 billion earlier this year. Since then Wal-Mart Stores CEO Doug McMillon said he expects online sales to grow between 20% and 30% over the next three years. Online sales grew 19% in the first half of this year, but the online business remains only a fraction of Wal-Mart’s overall $500 billion annual revenue. Keith Anderson, vice president of strategy and insights for Profitero, told Talk Business & Politics, Wal-Mart faces plenty of challenges as it works to build market share online. “Amazon has been at this for more than a decade and continues to invest in ancillary devices and products other than retail. But each of these add value to Amazon customers,” Anderson said. Michael Levin, co-founder of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, estimates Prime members spend an average of $1,100 annually with Amazon, not counting the membership fee. Non-prime members spend about $600. In contrast Wal-Mart has said it’s online-only customers spend an average of $200 annually, while store only shoppers spend $1,400. Shoppers who use both methods have an average spend of $2,500, and represent an audience Wal-Mart hopes to grow. One way that is happening is via an expansive rollout of the Walmart U.S. online grocery pickup service now in 100 markets, up from five earlier this year. Wal-Mart spokesman Ravi Jariwala said the service receives high customer satisfaction scores, repeat rates and net promoter scores. Jariwala said it’s too early to discuss details of the retailer’s recent grocery pickup and fueling station which opened two weeks ago in Denver. The online grocery pickup combined with a fueling station has been on the drawing board for more than three years dating back to former Walmart U.S. CEO Bill Simon, who talked about the model as one of several the retailer would test.

Here’s The List Shopping 2 0 0 December 21, 2016 Walmart Christmas Eve Hours: What Time Do Stores And Malls Close December 24? Here’s The List Cheryl P What time does Walmart close on Christmas Eve, and what time will other retail stores and malls close their doors on Saturday night? If you still have holiday gifts to buy, get your list together, and check out the list below for a complete rundown of holiday store hours for popular retailers including Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Toys R Us, Kohl’s, JCPenney, Pink, Macy’s, Old Navy, and more. This year, Christmas Eve falls on a Saturday, so if you are headed to the mall to finish up your holiday shopping, expect crowded parking lots, long lines, empty shelves, and the worst thing of all, stores that have closed early for the holiday, including the always popular Walmart and Walmart Superstores. Last year, Walmart stores stayed open until 8 p.m. on Christmas Eve, but that’s not the case for 2016. According to CNN Money, the company has decided to lock their doors at 6 p.m. this year to give their employees a much-needed break. And yes, all Walmart stores will be closed on Christmas Day as well. Not all retail stores and malls will close early on December 24, and there are a few options if you can’t get out to shop until after Walmart closes. Here’s a list of retail store closing times (including grocery stores) for Christmas Eve, as well as some information about stores that will be open 24-hours a day in the days leading up to Santa’s big night. 2016 Christmas Eve store closing times Stores close early Christmas Eve. [Image by Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images] Before we get to the list of retail store holiday hours, keep in mind that it’s not just your favorite big-box stores, mall stores, and grocery stores that will be closing early on Christmas Eve. According to the U.S. Postal Service, the lobby areas at most post office branches will close at noon and will not reopen until Monday, December 26. If your bank is normally open on a Saturday, call ahead to find out if they are observing special holiday hours. Whether you need gift cards, toys, clothing, electronics, or just some gift wrap and tape, a number of stores will be open as late as 10 p.m. on Christmas Eve. According to CNBC, Kohl’s will be open around-the-clock from December 20 through closing time on Christmas Eve. Toys R Us will stay open for 39 straight hours starting December 23. Here’s a breakdown by closing time of some of the most popular retailers in the U.S. Closing times may vary by location, so it’s always a good idea to call ahead. Santa finishes his Christmas shopping. [Image by Jeff J. Mitchell/Getty Images] 6 p.m. — According to the Balance, Kohl’s, Macy’s, Walmart, Dillards, JC Penney, Barnes & Noble, Lowe’s, the Apple Store, Bed, Bath & Beyond, and Trader Joe’s will lock their doors at 6 p.m. local time. 7 p.m. — Old Navy, Publix, Meijer, and Rite-Aid in most locations will close for the holiday at 7 p.m. on Christmas Eve. 8 p.m. — Most H-E-B and Whole Foods will stay open on December 24 until 8 p.m. local time. 9 p.m. — Shop ’til you drop at Albertson’s, REI, and Toys R Us until 9 p.m. local time, but don’t forget gift wrap and boxes! 10 p.m. — Target will be open until 10 p.m. on Christmas Eve and at least two other retailers will stay open ’til 10 for last-minute shoppers, including KMart and Big Lots. If you are hoping to get to popular mall stores like Pink, Victoria’s Secret, American Eagle, Bath and Body Works, and Aeropostale, the closing times for these stores will rely on the holiday hours set by the mall the stores are in. If the store does not have an exit door separate from the mall, as is the case with JCPenney, Old Navy, and Macy’s stores, shoppers can expect to find the store closing times to be in accordance with the mall’s operating hours.

 Walmart pulls 'Black Lives Matter' shirt after police accuse retailer of 'profiting from racial division' Kate Taylor Dec. 21, 2016, 12:45 PM 4,694 facebook linkedin twitter email print Liberty University student Jeff Long, of Washington DC., wears a Black Lives Matter t-shirt as he looks for a seat prior to a speech by Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., Monday, Jan. 18, 2016.Steve Helber/AP Walmart pulled a Black Lives Matter shirt and hoodie from its online store Wednesday after police accused the retailer of helping third-party sellers profit "from racial division."  The hoodie and shirt that were pulled featured the slogan, "Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter," and were being sold through Walmart Marketplace, the retailer's website that features millions of items from third-party sellers.  On Tuesday, Chuck Canterbury, the national president of the Fraternal Order of Police, wrote a public letter to Walmart calling out its Marketplace site for selling merchandise that promotes the Black Lives Matter movement, which organizes protests across the US to draw attention to racism and police brutality. "Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to built greater trust and respect for one another," Canterbury wrote in the letter. In response, Walmart said in a statement that it would remove apparel that said, "Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter," from its online store. Shirts and hoodies with this "Bulletproof" design have been removed from Walmart's online store.Old Glory "Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise," Walmart said in a statement. "After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the 'bulletproof' reference." The "Bulletproof" shirts are made by Old Glory, an apparel retailer based in Centerbrook, Connecticut that also sells "All Lives Matter" and "Blue Lives Matter" shirts through Walmart's website.  The retail giant's website will continue to offer items including t-shirts, sweatshirts, and hats bearing the words "Black Lives Matter," created and sold by third-party retailers. Walmart's website also features apparel that read "All Lives Matter," "Blue Lives Matter," "Homeless Lives Matter," and "Journalists Lives Matter." A search "Black Lives Matter" on Walmart's site Wednesday morning. The 'Bulletproof' hoodie, second from the left, has since been cut from the site.Walmart.com As of Wednesday at 11 a.m., the "Bulletproof" shirt could no longer be accessed on Walmart's website, but other "Black Lives Matter" merchandise remained available.  Breitbart, a right-wing website that has been critical of the Black Lives Matter movement, published an article last week calling out Walmart for selling "Black Lives Matter" merchandise on its website. Following the publication of Brietbart's article, a number of people took to social media to complain about the shirts.  SEE ALSO: Walmart under fire for 'disgusting' 9/11 tribute NOW WATCH: The most surprising brands millennials love Loading video...

Black Lives Matter.” The national Fraternal Order of Police wrote to the retailer on Tuesday asking it to pull the shirts. Last week, an article on the right-wing website Breitbart complained that Wal-Mart dropped items that displayed the Confederate flag but still sold the “bulletproof” items. Wal-Mart wasn’t actually selling the “Bulletproof. Black Lives Matter” clothes itself, but they were available for purchase on its website via a third-party merchant. “Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise,” a Wal-Mart spokesman said. “After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the ‘bulletproof’ reference.” Wal-Mart’s move satisfied the police union, which does not object to the phrase “Black Lives Matters” by itself, according to James Pasco, the group’s executive director. “The bulletproof thing goes to the new assertiveness of some violence prone individuals to take action directly against police. We find it offensive for that reason,” Pasco said. Pasco added the police union had yet to reach out to the third party vendor, Old Glory, that sells the bulletproof items. But Old Glory owner Glenn Morelli said he’s already decided to take down the shirt from his site as well. “It wasn’t a big seller at all. The Blue Lives Matter sells more than the Black Lives Matter or bulletproof shirts combined,” Morelli said. “We don’t like to offend anybody.” He said his company offers more than 500,000 different kinds of shirts and sweatshirts on its site. “When you sell that many, you have to sell all different kinds of shirts,” he said. “It’s hard to make everybody happy.” Filed in: National/World News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Pinterest Email Have a news tip?

Published Dec 21st, 2016 11:55 am ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Online retail should top $590 billion in annual sales by 2021. U.S. online retail topped $100 billion in 2006, and online sales are expected to top $345 billion this year, according to Forrester Research. Forrester said Amazon captured $23 billion more in U.S. e-commerce sales last year over 2014. Amazon’s growth accounted for about 51% of the total U.S. online sales growth last year. Walmart.com is a distant second place despite spending more than $6 billion in this area in the past three years. Market watchers suggest Walmart.com will never catch Amazon in terms of market size and share, but in terms of omnichannel, Wal-Mart has a head start with its nearly 5,000 U.S. stores which can be showrooms, pickup centers and fulfillment centers as more retail gravitates online. Amazon recently has become interested in opening physical stores that are a test bed for consumer convenience. While the majority of retail sales are conducted in physical stores, the relationship between physical and online commerce is growing. Forrester said more than 40%, or $1.5 trillion, of U.S. retail sales were in some way influenced by the internet – which could include product research, and writing online reviews of items purchased. Jason Long, CEO of Shift Marketing Group, said there are low barriers to entry for online retailers, whether they choose to set up their own store or sell through various marketplaces or use both, the competition online is fierce and will only intensify. Forrester said merchants surveyed earlier this year cited online and and online merchandising as their top two priorities for 2016. The merchants said in light of expensive paid search costs, they were more likely to focus on customer service relationships, personalization and loyalty programs to try and drive more engagement with shoppers. Noting that omnichannel efforts are a work in progress for many retailers, merchants were optimistic about ship-from-the-store, in-store pickup programs and other efforts such as endless aisle which have proven successful in getting shoppers in-store to search online for expanded product options. Sam’s Club reports moderate success with endless aisle in healthcare products such as lift chairs, fine jewelry and patio furniture. Shoppers can see a small sampling of these products in the clubs, but there is a much broader selection in a catalog located in the clubs. The club members select the item they want, pay for it and it can be delivered to their home the following day in many cases. Because the barrier to entry is low, the online retail market is huge, and the market share held by Amazon makes gaining any ground a constant challenge for competitors like Walmart.com. Wal-Mart has spent around $6 billion on its e-commerce division in three years, including buying Jet.com for $3.1 billion earlier this year. In buying up a competitive threat like Jet.com, Wal-Mart remains well behind Amazon in online market share. Last year Amazon’s total online sales online $79.268 billion, making it the nation’s largest e-tailer. Amazon’s Prime membership has grown to 63 million, with almost half the households in the U.S. Wal-Mart’s e-commerce sales of $13.484 billion rank the retailer in second place. Wal-Mart also offers a shipping pass membership, akin to Prime which was launched this year, but the retailer has not shared how many subscribers have signed up. Analysts said Prime is not just about free shipping. It brings subscribers into the Amazon ecosystem. That is something Wal-Mart has not been able to accomplish, despite launching WalmartPay earlier this year along with other mobile app services such as gift registry and prescription refill. Apple ranks third at $12 billion in online sales. Macy’s comes in fifth at $4.928 billion, while Home Depot ranked sixth with $3.78 billion in online sales last year. Wal-Mart competitor Target had $2.524 billion in online sales putting it in 11th place. Wal-Mart’s online traffic equals just 7% of weekly store traffic and is approaching 3% of the sales. The majority of Wal-Mart’s online shoppers also shop in the retailer’s stores, 80% at least once a month and half of online shoppers frequent the retailer’s stores once a week, according to analysts with Cleveland Research. Keith Anderson, vice president of strategy and insights for Profitero, said Wal-Mart is known as a fast follower in all of its other success stories over the years. He said when it comes to e-commerce it’s the first movers who will likely win the gold. He said Amazon was the first mover in e-commerce and continues to invest aggressively which has garnered it accelerated growth over Walmart.com and the rest of U.S. retail. Anderson said Amazon has been at the e-commerce game much longer, and it’s not important that Wal-Mart ever catch up entirely. He said there is likely room for two big players, and Walmart U.S. has a big lead in terms of grocery, which will likely be one of the last categories to migrate purely online.

Hong Walmart to stop selling 'Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter' shirts after police protest By Tom Jackman • Washington Post Dec 21, 2016 (…) AP Photo/Jae C. Hong Updated at 12:38 p.m. The president of the national Fraternal Order of Police, the country's largest police organization, on Tuesday asked Walmart to stop selling T-shirts and sweatshirts which say "Black Lives Matter" and "Bulletproof" on the department store's website. On Tuesday night, Walmart said it would remove the shirts which say "Bulletproof," but not the "Black Lives Matter" shirts. "Black Lives Matter" is a slogan and protest movement which emerged after the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012 and police-involved slayings in 2014, and is seen as offensive by many in law enforcement. The website Breitbart.com posted an article last week which said that Walmart was "selling Black Lives Matter clothing and other items," though the merchandise is actually being sold through Walmart's website by Old Glory Merchandise, a music and entertainment apparel dealer out of Connecticut. Chuck Canterbury, the FOP president, wrote to Walmart CEO C. Douglas McMillon Tuesday to advise him that the Walmart website was selling "offensive shirts and sweatshirts," and "I urge you to prohibit the use of the Walmart name and website for the retail sale of these products." The Walmart site and Old Glory's site also sell "Blue Lives Matter" shirts. Canterbury said he understood that a third party was selling the merchandise, but "I am concerned that allowing these articles to be sold in this way will damage your company's good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers." Canterbury added, "Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another." "Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise," Walmart said in a statement late Tuesday. "After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the 'bulletproof' reference." The "bulletproof" shirts say "Bulletproof" with "Black Lives Matter" beneath that line. Old Glory did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Jim Pasco, the executive director of the police union in Washington, said the issue was raised by union members who felt Walmart was selling anti-police items. "There are a lot of people who feel too many guns are sold," Pasco said. "Why not speak out against things that might be seen as fomenting violence, rather than things that commit violence?" _____________________ Our earlier story, posted at 2 a.m. Wednesday.

Canterbury added, "Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another." Walmart and Old Glory did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday evening. Jim Pasco, the executive director of the police union in Washington, D.C., said the issue was raised by union members who felt Walmart was selling anti-police items. "There are a lot of people who feel too many guns are sold," Pasco said. "Why not speak out against things that might be seen as fomenting violence, rather than things that commit violence?"

(File) Print Email Christian Alexandersen | calexandersen@pennlive.com By Christian Alexandersen | calexandersen@pennlive.com The Patriot-News Email the author | Follow on Twitter on December 21, 2016 at 1:27 PM, updated December 22, 2016 at 10:56 AM comments The National Fraternal Order of Police has pressured Walmart to discontinue selling a shirt on their website that says 'BULLETPROOF: Black Lives Matter.'  Walmart issued a statement Tuesday that said it would stop selling the t-shirts and sweatshirts, but would continue selling items that say just 'Black Lives Matter,' 'Blue Lives Matter' and 'All Lives Matter.' The 'BULLETPROOF' shirt was created by a third-party dealer, Old Glory Merchandise, and sold on Walmart's website. The decision to stop selling the shirt came after FOP President C. Douglas McMillon sent a letter dated Dec. 20 asking Walmart to do so. McMillon referred to the shirts as "offensive." A shirt sold on Walmart's website said "BULLETPROOF" with "Black Lives Matter" underneath it. Screenshots  "At a time of year when we as a nation and indeed, as a world, should be coming together in hopes of peace on Earth and goodwill toward men, these third party sellers are profiting from racial division," McMillon wrote. "Commercializing our differences will not help out local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another." He added, "Turning a buck on strained relationships will not contribute to the healing process." By Wednesday morning, the shirts were still visible on the Walmart website but they could not be purchased online.

Black Lives Matter.” The national Fraternal Order of Police wrote to the retailer on Tuesday asking it to pull the shirts. Last week, an article on the right-wing web site Breitbart complained that Walmart dropped items that displayed the Confederate flag but still sold the “bulletproof” items. Walmart wasn’t actually selling the “Bulletproof. Black Lives Matter.” clothes itself, but they were available for purchase on its website via a third-party merchant. “Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise,” said a Walmart spokesman. “After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the ‘bulletproof’ reference.” Walmart’s move satisfied the police union, which does not object to the phrase “Black Lives Matters” by itself, according to James Pasco, the group’s executive director. “The bulletproof thing goes to the new assertiveness of some violence prone individuals to take action directly against police. We find it offensive for that reason,” said Pasco. Pasco added that the police union had yet to reach out to the third party vendor, Old Glory, that sells the bulletproof items. But Old Glory owner Glenn Morelli said he’s already decided to take down the shirt from his site as well. “It wasn’t a big seller at all. The Blue Lives Matter sells more than the Black Lives Matter or bulletproof shirts combined,” Morelli said. “We don’t like to offend anybody.” He said his company offers more than 500,000 different kinds of shirts and sweatshirts on its site. “When you sell that many, you have to sell all different kinds of shirts,” he said. “It’s hard to make everybody happy.” GamerGate critic Brianna Wu to run for Congress Banks told to give back 'unfair' mortgage payments Related Posts Cuban entrepreneurs take Startup 101 Ben Carson wants guns in class.

The retail giant, in an unprecedented move, announced its plan to cut Christmas Eve hours Tuesday. The country’s largest retailer is slashing its Christmas Eve hours at stores across the country by two hours. Previously open until 8 p.m. on Christmas Eve, stores will now close at 6 p.m. The store will also be closed on Christmas Day. In a news release Tuesday, Walmart headquarters announced the move as a gesture to its employees. “Our associates work hard all year to make this holiday season special for our customers, and we truly appreciate what they do every day,” said Judith McKenna, the company’s executive vice president and chief operating officer. “We also know that getting home on Christmas Eve to spend time with families is important. That’s why this year we’ll be closing at 6 p.m. on Christmas Eve.” Related Stories Last-Minute Holiday Sales To Shop Ahead Of Holidays ‘Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter’ Clothing Pulled Off Walmart Shelves A Walmart employee fixes a sign indicating there are 30 more days until Christmas at a store in Miami, Florida, Nov. 24, 2015. Walmart announced Tuesday they'd be slashing their store hours on Christmas Eve from 8 p.m. to 6 p.m. Photo: Getty The move comes as something of a surprise for the company, which has drawn criticism in the past for its Thanksgiving Day hours, during which Black Friday sales at the store start at 6 p.m. The store also starts its Cyber Monday deals on Black Friday. In recent years, protesters have railed against the retail giant’s labor practices, though the company has taken steps to better serve their employees as of late.  In February 2016, Walmart raised the wages of more than one million of its employees, both part-time and full-time. The company also altered its scheduling system to make it more regular for its employees in order to provide them with more stable situations. The retailer employs more than two million people worldwide, more than any other company in the U.S., and operates in 28 different countries. Last year, Walmart raked in $486 billion in sales.

(WGNO) – A Kenner man was arrested today in connection with a kidnapping and carjacking that happened Dec. 15 in the Walmart parking lot in Kenner. According to Kenner Police, Clyde Reed, 35, is accused of trying to steal a TV from Walmart by placing the television in a shopping cart and trying to wheel it out without paying. When confronted by Walmart employees, Reed abandoned the stolen television and ran into the parking lot. He then jumped into a 2014 Ford F-150 pickup truck that was parked with the engine running. Reed took off in the truck without knowing that the truck’s owner, a 28-year-old man, was resting in the back seat. The owner of the truck tried to get control of his truck, and an altercation ensued. Reed is accused of hitting the victim and then crashing the truck into an SUV in the parking lot. Reed jumped out of the truck and fled on foot. The driver of the SUV had to be extricated from the vehicle. He suffered lacerations to the head. Reed was arrested by the U.S. Marshal’s Service and Kenner Police on a warrant for carjacking, simple kidnapping, negligent injuring, simple battery, reckless operation of a motor vehicle, hit-and-run driving and theft of goods. No bond was set as of mid-day Wednesday. Anyone who witnessed the carjacking and crash is asked to call Kenner Police Detective Aaron Savoie at 504-712-2301.

Subscribe for $59/Yr - Save $50 Lowdown: See How Audi Targets Toy Stereotypes in Spain Published on December 21, 2016. Most Popular The Lowdown is Ad Age's weekly look at news nuggets from across the world of marketing, including trends, campaign tidbits, executive comings and goings and more. Playing, like driving, should not be influenced by gender stereotypes. That is the message Audi in Spain is sending with a new animated digital video ad called "The doll that chose to drive." The spot follows a doll as she escapes the pink-colored girl toy aisle for the blue-tinted boys section. She browses toy trucks and police cars before hopping in a blue Audi. She revs the engine and takes it for a James Bond-style race. The spot ends when a boy shopping with his mom picks up the toy car with the doll in it. She tries to dissuade him from buying it, suggesting they don't go together. But he decides otherwise. The spot, by Proximity Barcelona and produced by Post23, is aimed at breaking down toy stereotypes during the Christmas season. Audi has produced a limited-edition toy of the car and the doll, according to a statement. "These two toys, usually kept apart by gender stereotypes, have been brought together this Christmas to show that play, like driving, is a gender-free area," according to a statement distributed by Proximity. Hatchimals are one holiday gift that seem to require no advertising. This year's must-have toy has largely been out of stock in most stores or online since early November, except for brief appearances in Black Friday promotions or weekly shipments to stores that get snatched up within minutes. Yet Walmart has continued to advertise the creatures prominently online, including its own exclusive Burtle Hatchimal as recently as Dec. 20 on the Yahoo sign-in page. The "Save Money. Live Better." folks also are doing Google search ads that lead to Hatchimals on sale from third-party vendors on Walmart.com for more than four times the original $49.99 to $59.99 price tag for the Spin Master product. Credit: Walmart/Yahoo One person familiar with Walmart believes the continued Hatchimal advertising may be to help bolster its third-party marketplace, where it's long been at a distinct disadvantage to Amazon. Walmart also is advertising lower-cost and more available alternatives on its site and in search at times too – including FurReal Friends Torch, My Blazin' Dragon for a mere $59, $20 off the original price. But the continued advertising for three-figure Hatchimals has produced a bit of grumbling about Walmart in social media. Why advertise something that seemingly sells itself? A Walmart spokeswoman noted that new shipments of Hatchimals continue to arrive at stores all the time – even if they sell out fast. And Walmart isn't entirely alone here. Toys 'R Us and Target also have been buying Google search ads against Hatchimals queries, generally later in the day than Walmart. If it's any consolation to parents who can't lay their hands on Hatchimals it's that reviews are mixed. Immediately after the blessed event, in which after hours of rubbing and other coddling the plush toy emerges from its shell, parents report their little ones often lose interest, whether the Hatchimal cost $49.99 or $259.95. Moving on to the beer beat: MillerCoors is taking some heat for billboards erected in Milwaukee that plug higher alcohol content for Milwaukee's Best Ice. The signs simply say: "Milwaukee's Best Ice. Now 6.9% Alc/Vol." The brew used to be at 5.9%. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel this week covered the billboards in a lengthy piece that included several critical comments, including from a well-known activist and Catholic priest in Chicago named Michael Pfleger, who alleged that MillerCoors "made a conscious choice" to plug the higher alcohol in the brew. "We're no longer just advertising the drink – now we're advertising how much alcohol you can get in the consumption of the drink," he told the newspaper. The brewer told the MJS that it is "committed to leading the industry in transparency so that our consumers can make fully informed choices." Here is one way to make an old ad slogan new again: Procter & Gamble Co.'s Pantene has turned its 1980s "Don't hate me because I'm beautiful" slogan on its head with an ad from mixed martial artist Ronda Rousey. Ms. Rousey, due for a big Dec. 30 match against current champion Amanda Nunes to regain her UFC bantamweight title, turns the selling line into "Don't hate me because I'm strong." "Ronda is the future of strong women everywhere," said P&G VP-North America Hair Care Jodi Allen in a statement. The ad from WPP's Grey is about "women rising above society's expectations and proving once and for all that strong is always beautiful," Ms. Allen said. Mark Cuban, the only "Shark Tank" investor to put money into Dude Wipes during an episode of the series last year, makes a cameo appearance uttering the brand's "take it to the hole" tagline in a new ad for the masculine-hygiene brand. In a new two-minute video from production company Polymyth Chicago. Dude Products portrays its wipes as a solution for a dad who finds himself stuck in a stall that's out of toilet paper in the boy's restroom of his son's elementary school on parent's night. Certainly, Dude Wipes beat the alternative of terrifying the occupant of the stall next door to ask for help, or using junior's artwork to do the job. The ad helps support Dude Wipes' recent move into the toilet-paper aisle at Target stores, the first startup "non-billion-dollar-brand" to make it there, a Dude spokesman said. But, course, Dude Wipes are so much more, alternately billed as a sort of portable quick shower for guys who need to freshen up in all kinds of ways. Finally, one executive move to report this week: Reusable water bottle brand S'well is upping its business prowess by hiring its first chief marketing officer.

Anderson was shot and killed during an officer-involved shooting in the Dallas Walmart parking lot on Friday evening, according to Oregon State Police. A preliminary investigation by OSP and its partners revealed that at 5:26 p.m., three Dallas police officers responded to a complaint of an adult male who appeared intoxicated in the parking lot at Walmart. OSP Captain Bill Fugate said that an officer does not have to catch someone driving, but can use probable cause to determine if they were operating a vehicle while intoxicated. Officers attempted to take Anderson, 36, of Dallas, into custody for driving under the influence of intoxicants. According to the report from OSP, Anderson resisted arrest and fired as many as two rounds, striking Sgt. Rob Hatchell in the leg. Hatchell and officer Mike Fleming returned fire, striking Anderson, reports state. Anderson was pronounced dead at the scene. Hatchell was released from the hospital shortly after receiving treatment for his injuries. All three officers have been placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation. Officer Aaron Mollahan was also present and was not injured. Investigators located Anderson's firearm at the scene. Fugate said Monday that he did not know who the gun was registered to nor if police video of the incident was available. He said information would be shared once authorized by District Attorney Aaron Felton. Anderson had previous police encounters, according to court records. The most recent was a 2015 violation of his probation following a conviction in a DUII incident that took place in late 2013. The community has reacted in a variety of ways. Dallas Police Chief Tom Simpson said the department gives any threat the appropriate level of attention and shares information with other public safety officials in the region. OSP is leading the investigation at Simpson’s and Felton’s request. OSP is being assisted by Grand Ronde Tribal Police, Polk County Sheriff’s Office, Monmouth Police Department, Independence Police Department, Salem Police Department, and Dallas Fire & EMS.

Here are some last-minute options By Associated Press Published: 11:48 EST, 21 December 2016 | Updated: 11:48 EST, 21 December 2016 e-mail NEW YORK (AP) — Holiday shopping procrastinators can breathe easy. Yes, most online shipping deadlines have passed. But many retailers are offering other ways to get gifts at the last minute, whether it's staying open through the wee hours of the night like Toys R Us, or offering Christmas Eve store pickup like Wal-Mart. Here are some options for those still scrambling to buy presents: MIDNIGHT RUNS FILE - In this Thursday, Nov. 24, 2016, file photo, Stephanie Rowell and her daughter Sydney, 5, shop at Toys R Us - Town Center in Kennesaw, Ga. Holiday shopping procrastinators can breathe easy. Yes, most online shipping deadlines have passed. But many retailers are offering other ways to get gifts at the last minute, whether it¿s staying open through the wee hours of the night like Toys R Us, or offering Christmas Eve store pickup like Wal-Mart. (Hyosub Shin/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP, File) Many stores are extending their hours in the days leading up to Christmas. Toys R Us will stay open from 6 a.m. on Dec. 23 straight to 9 p.m. on Christmas Eve, while department store Kohl's will stay open from Dec. 20 until Christmas Eve. Certain Macy's department stores will be open all night between Dec. 22 and Dec. 23. Sears will close at midnight through Dec. 23 and close at 6 p.m. on Christmas Eve. And Target will be open from 7 a.m. to midnight through Dec. 23 and stay open until at least 10 p.m. on Christmas Eve. SHOP THE UNEXPECTED If you can't make it to the mall, a quick stop at a drug or specialty store might work. CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid are increasingly stocking their shelves with more toys for the little ones. And those three drugstores also have a big selection of plastic gift cards for use at other stores, such as video game retailer GameStop or bookseller Barnes & Noble. Meanwhile, office supplies store Staples sells flying drones and adult coloring books. And Dick's Sporting Goods has Apple Watches, headphones and GoPro cameras. STORE PICKUP If you want to avoid searching for items in the store, you're in luck. Many retailers let you buy items online and pick them up at a store the same day. After ordering and paying online, walk to a special section of the store with the confirmation email and ID and that's it. Macy's, Target and Best Buy are just some of the stores that offer store pickup. Wal-Mart says customers who order items before 6 p.m. on Dec. 23 can pick them up on Christmas Eve and even launched a website with the items that qualify at walmart.com/lastminutegifts. And at Sears.com, those who opt for store pickup between now and Christmas Eve can get 20 percent off clothing, jewelry and home goods if they type in a special promo code. SEND AN E-GIFT The websites of some major stores are offering a way to give an instant gift, called an e-gift. It's similar to a gift card, but is supposed to be a little more personal: You choose the item you want to buy — say sneakers or a sweater — click the "E-Gift" or "GiftNow" button, pay, and then the recipient gets an email telling them you bought them a gift. The gift receiver accepts it and can make adjustments, such as changing the color or size, before it ships. Or they can just get something else entirely from the store. The service carries no extra charges to the gift giver or receiver, and is available on several websites, including Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom and Ralph Lauren. SAME-DAY DELIVERY It will cost you more, but if you're desperate, you can get some items delivered the same day you order them online. Macy's offers same-day delivery in some cities and so does Nordstrom. But be aware, some may not deliver on Christmas Eve, like Nordstrom. If you're an Amazon.com Prime member paying the annual fee, the online retailer is lets shoppers in Miami, New York and other cities order toys, electronics and other gifts as late as 9:45 p.m. on Christmas Eve for delivery in two hours, meaning you'll get it before midnight. OR JUST WAIT Procrastination may work in your favor if you end up not seeing a person you're shopping for until after Christmas. That's when after-holiday sales kick in, says Sara Skirboll, a shopping and trends expert at shopping deal app RetailMeNot. If the timing works, you'll likely pay less for a gift than you would if you had bought it before the holidays, says Skirboll. _____ Contact Joseph Pisani at http://twitter.com/josephpisani .

On Tuesday night, Wal-Mart said it would remove the shirts which say "Bulletproof" but not the "Black Lives Matter" shirts. "Black Lives Matter" is a slogan and protest movement that emerged after the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012 and police-involved slayings in 2014 and is seen as offensive by many in law enforcement. The website Breitbart.com posted an article last week that said that Wal-Mart was "selling Black Lives Matter clothing and other items," though the merchandise is actually being sold through Wal-Mart's website by Old Glory Merchandise, a music and entertainment apparel dealer out of Connecticut. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Chuck Canterbury, the FOP president, wrote Tuesday to Wal-Mart CEO C. Douglas McMillon to advise him that the Wal-Mart website was selling "offensive shirts and sweatshirts," and "I urge you to prohibit the use of the Wal-Mart name and website for the retail sale of these products." The Wal-Mart site and Old Glory's site also sell "Blue Lives Matter" shirts. Canterbury said he understood that a third party was selling the merchandise, but "I am concerned that allowing these articles to be sold in this way will damage your company's good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers." Canterbury added, "Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another." In response, Wal-Mart said that, "Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise. After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the 'bulletproof' reference." The "bulletproof" shirts say "Bulletproof" with "Black Lives Matter" beneath that line.

Walmart has said it will pull shirts emblazoned with "Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter," but not those that read only "Black Lives Matter", from its website following a letter from the Fraternal Order of Police that called the shirts "offensive." The clothing was being sold by a third-party vendor on Walmart's website. Ted S. Warren/AP/File | Caption Ellen Powell @ellenrpowell December 21, 2016 —Walmart agreed to pull a Black Lives Matter shirt emblazoned with the word “Bulletproof” from its website, in a move that highlights the challenge facing retailers on social justice issues – as well as efforts by communities and police to promote unity while acknowledging criticism. The Fraternal Order of Police, the largest police organization in the country, had originally asked Walmart to pull two shirts from its website: the “Bulletproof” shirt, which reads “Black Lives Matter” in smaller font on a second line; and a shirt that reads simply “Black Lives Matter.” Both shirts are sold on Walmart’s website by a third-party vendor, Connecticut-based Old Glory Merchandise. In a letter on Tuesday, Fraternal Order of Police president Chuck Canterbury told Walmart CEO C. Douglas McMillon that the shirts were “offensive” and "profiting from racial division." For the Fraternal Order of Police, the T-shirt encourages community division and even violence, and it detracts from efforts to sow cooperation between police and the communities they serve, Mr. Canterbury argued. But others suggest that Black Lives Matter is a peaceful movement that, by calling attention to a history of differential treatment, has an important role to play in forging unity going forward.  “Those who use the phrase do not advocate violence,” writes Shawn Alexander, a professor of African and African-American studies at the University of Kansas, in an email to The Christian Science Monitor. Efforts to paint Black Lives Matter as violent or divisive, he adds, seek to “cover up the troublesome truth of America’s racist past and how that history continues to live and [affect] us today.” The Black Lives Matter movement emerged after the death of teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012. Since then, it has been working to advocate for black Americans: In August, the movement released a six-part platform aimed at addressing historical grievances.  How well do you know #BlackLivesMatter? Take the quiz. According to Professor Alexander, the phrase “Black Lives Matter” – and the movement associated with it – highlight “the irrefutable fact that historically black lives have not mattered, or have not been valued in the same manner as white lives.” But Black Lives Matter has drawn criticism from law enforcement officials, who may see it as an affront to their daily efforts to protect their communities. After police union members said they felt Walmart was selling anti-police clothing, the Fraternal Order of Police decided to ask the company to remove those items from their website, said Jim Pasco, executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, the Washington Post reported. “Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another,” Canterbury wrote in Tuesday’s letter, posted on the Washington Post's website. For Walmart, the solution has been a compromise of sorts. The company decided to pull the “Bulletproof” shirt, while allowing vendors to continue selling Black Lives Matter shirts. Also available from third-party vendors on Walmart’s website are shirts for Blue Lives Matter, an organization that “seeks to honor and recognize the actions of law enforcement” and encourage public support for law enforcement, as well as All Lives Matter. Across the country, Black Lives Matter activists and local police forces have been finding ways to share their experiences and improve their understanding of others’ perspectives.  After a peaceful march in Wichita, Kansas in July, local activists met with Police Chief Gordon Ramsay and decided to cancel their next march in favor of a free community cookout. One officer, Lt. Travis Rakestraw, sat with three men, including Hispanic student Ivan Ray. The way Ray looked at police violence through the lens of other social issues was illuminating, Lt. Rakestraw said, according to the Associated Press. In August, National Night Out brought together neighbors and police officers. With the air of a traditional community get-together, the event was intended to forge unity between citizens and law enforcement. “With the climate in the past two years, it’s extremely important that we celebrate National Night Out to show the unity among each other,” Washington, D.C. assistant police chief Diane Groomes told the Monitor’s Nicole Orttung. “The only way to get beyond the divisions is to become honest with the history,” says Alexander.  Not everyone agrees that Black Lives Matter is doing that: Carol Swain, a professor at Vanderbilt Law School, told CNN's Michael Smerconish that the organization is “not really addressing the real problems affecting African-Americans.” Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Sign-Up × But others say the movement’s efforts have already made a difference.  "Black Lives Matter has done more to move the needle on reforms in the criminal justice system than elected officials and community leaders all over this country,” countered civil rights attorney Areva Martin on the same CNN program.

The employee, a 16-year-old girl, suffered redness on the left side of her face and neck. She said the woman yelled at her before throwing the drink. She described the woman as being 19-20-years-old and pregnant and said she had several children with her. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A Cleveland girl, 16, was arrested at Walmart Dec. 15 for the theft of multiple jewelry items, valued at a total of $42. She told officers she had the money to pay for the items but experienced a temporary lapse of reason and thought she could get away without paying for them. Endangering child, Warrensville Center Road: Officers found a vehicle in the Walmart parking lot at 9:18 p.m. Dec. 12 that was occupied by just three children between the ages of three and eight. When their mother returned to the car, she told officers she was only inside the store for five minutes to use the bathroom. Another woman returned to the car with her and had a cart full of items from the store. They asked her if she went into the store with the mother, but she would not answer. The mother, a 28-year-old Cleveland woman, was cited for endangering children. It was later learned through surveillance video that she and the other woman were in the store for over an hour. Weapons offense, Sheffield Road: A man reported Dec. 13 a neighbor had accidentally fired a gun and the bullet came into his house and through a bed's headboard. He said the man came over and apologized for the misfiring that occurred while he was in his attic. Officers spoke to the neighbor, who said he pulled the trigger to de-cock it, not realizing there was a round in the chamber. The man, 23, was cited for discharging firearms. Theft, Princeton Boulevard: A man, 77, reported Dec. 13 four checks were fraudulently issued from his bank account to the son of a woman who cleans his home. He said it would have been easy for the Euclid woman, 46, to take the checks because he does not supervise her while she is cleaning. He asked to press charges against her and her 31-year-old son. A check of their criminal history showed charges ranging from check fraud to forgery and passing bad checks. General assistance, Monticello Boulevard: A man, 54, said Dec. 1 he had five iPhones stolen from him by a man and his brother after they gave him a ride to the University Heights Target store to buy them. He said an altercation occurred between them when they arrived back at his house and the men left with the phones that he had bought for $224 each. Officers told him to return to Target to obtain receipts as proof that he had bought them. Subsequently, officers spoke with a Target employee and learned the man did return to the store, but caused a disturbance and was since banned from the store. The employee also believed the man was involved in a phone buying scam, in which the phones are bought for a penny plus a small activation fee and then sold by the buyer, who claims they were stolen and requests the accounts be closed. They said the man purchased a total of four phones, two for $52 each and two for $60 apiece. Officers spoke with the man again and he claimed he bought them for his new business and was going to give two of them to employees, which were the two men that drove him to Target. He said they were not trustworthy though and he fired them while being driven home from Target. He denied buying them to sell them and said he did not know the last names of the two men or where they lived. Recovered property, Stonehaven Road: A man reported Dec. 6 a vehicle was parked in the driveway at his father's home and nobody knew who it belonged to or how it got there. Officers learned it was reported stolen out of Lakewood and advised officers from that city so they could notify the owner. The vehicle had no visible damage and the key was inside of it. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A Cleveland man, 21, was stopped for shoplifting at Walmart Dec. 6 after he asked an employee to push a cart, containing two TVs and two other items, to his car. He told officers he had been shot in the past year and as a result was still in need of medical attention. His arm was in a sling and major scarring and stitches were visible. Due to his medical condition, he was cited for the $835.80 theft and released. Theft, Parkside Boulevard: A woman said Dec. 12 her granddaughter, 15, used her bank account fraudulently to charge $278 worth of Uber and Lyft rides for herself and her boyfriend. She said she had already filed unruly juvenile charges against her in juvenile court and needed a report for her bank's fraud department. Traffic offense, Mayfield Road: The driver of a vehicle refused to identify herself and said she never had a driver's license after officers pulled her vehicle over around 1 a.m. Dec. 16 for not having its headlights illuminated. Inside the vehicle was suspected marijuana and an open bottle of cognac. The driver was subsequently identified as a 17-year-old University Heights girl and is facing charges in juvenile court for open container, drug abuse, curfew and no operator's license. Breaking and entering, Warrensville Center Road: The rear door to a vacant business was found to have been kicked in Dec. 11. The glass on the door had previously been damaged and replaced with plywood. There was nothing missing from inside the business, but there was a mattress there that had not been there previously. There were no witnesses to the incident. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A Walmart employee was cited for theft at the store Dec. 11. The Cleveland woman, 20, admitted to label switching and taking unpaid deli items. She said she took about $200 worth of food items over the past several months.

BUSINESS Wal-Mart removes 'Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter' shirts after police complaint Black Lives Matter Matt Mills McKnight / European Pressphoto Agency Protesters carry a "Black Lives Matter" banner as they march through downtown Seattle in November. Protesters carry a "Black Lives Matter" banner as they march through downtown Seattle in November. (Matt Mills McKnight / European Pressphoto Agency) Tom Jackman Wal-Mart has agreed to remove T-shirts and sweatshirts that say “Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter” from its website after a complaint from the president of the country's largest police organization, but the retailer said it would not remove those that say only “Black Lives Matter.”  "Black Lives Matter" is a slogan and protest movement that emerged after a neighborhood watch volunteer killed unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 and intensified amid later police-involved deaths. Some law enforcement groups have accused it of being anti-police. The website Breitbart.com posted an article last week that said Wal-Mart was "selling Black Lives Matter clothing and other items," though the merchandise is actually being sold through Wal-Mart's website by Old Glory Merchandise, a music and entertainment apparel dealer out of Connecticut. Chuck Canterbury, president of the national Fraternal Order of Police, wrote to Wal-Mart Chief Executive C. Douglas McMillon on Tuesday to tell him the Wal-Mart website was selling "offensive shirts and sweatshirts." "I urge you to prohibit the use of the Walmart name and website for the retail sale of these products," Canterbury wrote.   The Wal-Mart site and Old Glory's site also sell shirts that say "Blue Lives Matter," a slogan that emerged to highlight the importance of law enforcement officers. Black Lives Matter activists have said the "blue lives" versus "black lives" debate obscures the point of their movement — which has expanded to focus on historical and modern-day discrimination and racial inequality that has plagued black Americans — and ignores police who have supported the movement. Canterbury said that he understood that a third party was selling the merchandise, but that he was "concerned that allowing these articles to be sold in this way will damage your company's good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers." Canterbury added: "Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another." Wal-Mart issued a statement Tuesday night saying: "Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise. After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the 'bulletproof' reference." The "bulletproof" shirts say "Bulletproof," with "Black Lives Matter" beneath that line. Old Glory did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Walmart is dropping the online sale of T-shirts and hooded sweatshirts bearing the message “Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter,” it announced Tuesday night, following a complaint from the country’s largest police organization. The national Fraternal Order of Police had called the message “offensive” in a letter to the giant retailer earlier that day. The 325,000-member organization has since issued a similar letter to Amazon complaining about the same products, as well as about shirts and sweatshirts bearing the words “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot.” “Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another. Turning a buck on strained relationships will not contribute to the healing process,” FOP President Chuck Canterbury wrote to Walmart CEO C. Douglas McMillon. Canterbury told McMillon that he was “concerned” that selling the shirts would “damage your company’s good name” among FOP members, as well as among other “active and retired law enforcement officers.” Shortly afterward, Walmart issued a statement to The Washington Post announcing it was dropping the products because of “customer complaints.” It will continue to sell other products bearing the words “Black Lives Matter.” “Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise. After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the ‘bulletproof’ reference,” said the statement. The “Bulletproof” shirts were being sold through the Walmart website by third-party vendor Old Glory Merchandise, which was not immediately available for comment. On Wednesday, Canterbury sent a similar letter to Amazon and its CEO, Jeffrey Bezos ― who also owns The Washington Post. “Because I believe you share the FOP’s goal of increasing the bonds of trust between the men and women of law enforcement and the communities they serve, I wanted to let you know that my members are very upset that you and Amazon are complicit in the sale of this very offensive merchandise,” Canterbury wrote to Bezos. Black Lives Matter merchandise on Amazon’s site comes from several different third-party sellers. Shirts saying “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot” were still available on the site Wednesday. “Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter” shirts were not for sale. Amazon was not immediately available for comment. The Fraternal Order of Police has clashed frequently with the Black Lives Matter movement, which was born when Trayvon Martin’s killer was acquitted in 2013 and has been fueled by the deaths of other black men at the hands of police. The FOP has claimed that the movement is anti-police and places officers’ lives in danger. Last year it began to push for classifying attacks on police officers as hate crimes.

That’s what three Virginia Walmart stores did.” The ad, which is helmed by Making Change at Walmart, a campaign funded by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, expands on claims the union made two weeks ago. Both then and now, the union says three Walmarts, including two in Hampton Roads, Virginia, barricade hair-care products marketed toward African-Americans in plastic security packaging, while leaving similar products disproportionately solicited to white customers undisturbed and within easy reach. Video segments in the commercial seem to support this claim; however, The Virginian-Pilot asserts only one of the cited stores actually uses the protective measures mentioned in the ad. When contacted by the paper, a Walmart rep wrote the protective packaging was part of a “normal” practice to minimize theft of at-risk items. The incident arrives on the heels of another Walmart controversy, where Black Lives Matter T-shirts were pulled from the store’s virtual shelves. Currently, the megastore sees no wrongdoing in the security measures, designating the discriminatory claims as “false and offensive.” The Virginian-Pilot Tags: beautywalmarthairhairy situations Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top StoriesCarrie Fisher’s Urn Might Be a Big Prozac PillWill Vitamin C Cure My Cold?Condé Nast Staffers Staged a ‘Fashion Protest’ During Trump’s Visit Most Viewed Stories Republicans Confirm Planned Parenthood Will Lose Federal Funding As Soon As Next Month Both Sides of a Breakup: Their Open Marriage Still Makes Him Want to Vomit Can Anyone Spot What’s Wrong With This Newspaper Cover on the Women’s March on Washington?

Orders have been placed by over 300 growers supplying Walmart with a variety of fresh produce items. “Walmart chooses to use Wood Grain RPCs to deliver produce for a variety of reasons,” said Shawn Baldwin, SVP Produce, Floral, Global Food Sourcing, Walmart USA. “They have better ventilation, they’re ergonomically designed and very easy to use. And, our customers really like the new Wood Grain RPCs because they look more like a farmers market or roadside fruit stand which provides a level of comfort during the shopping experience.” “We are proud to partner with Walmart and its fresh produce suppliers to provide them with innovative, efficient, cost-effective and sustainable reusable packaging that transitions easily to in-store display,” said Daniel Walsh, President of IFCO North America. “Surpassing the 11 million Wood Grain RPC threshold so quickly is an impressive accomplishment made possible through strong collaboration between Walmart, the grower community and IFCO.” To learn more about IFCO and the Wood Grain RPC click here Worldwide Business IFCO Interview. IFCO Wood Grain RPCs are used to ship fresh produce to Walmart under an agreement reached with the world’s largest retailer in October, 2015. The RPCs were designed to Walmart specifications and incorporated feedback received from the grower community. Like all IFCO RPCs, the Wood Grain RPCs are more efficient, protect and cool product better and are more environmentally sustainable than one-way packaging. IFCO has a strong commitment to supporting local economies, local companies and local workers in the marketplaces where it does business whenever possible. In the United States, IFCO’s Wood Grain RPCs are 100% sourced and manufactured in America and meet the Federal Trade Commission’s standard for its “Made in the USA” country of origin label.

The confrontation came after he asked a woman about items that may have been stolen. The incident occurred Tuesday night at the Walmart in Whitehaven at 5255 Elvis Presley Boulevard. The suspect, 35-year-old Kawanzaa Hutson, was arrested and released on an assault charge. A police report indicates the exchange between Hutson and the off-duty deputy got violent. The report states the deputy approached Hutson over items that were potentially stolen, and Hutson got angry, hitting the 54-year-old officer on the hand and upper body. It's unclear if any of the items were actually stolen. Investigators said Walmart surveillance cameras caught the attack. "If it's dangerous for the police; it's dangerous for everybody," said Michael Hines, who was shopping at the store Wednesday. A week and a half ago, a Memphis Police officer working security for bass Bass Pro Pyramid was knocked out cold by a suspected shoplifter running out with ammo. Shopper Debra Allen said the physical violence in the Walmart situation is terrifying. "It's very scary. If they would hurt somebody like that, what about me, my kids.. no respect," she said. WMC Action News 5 reached out to Kawanzaa Hutson and went to her last known address, and she was not there. She called our newsroom and left a number, but we've been unable to reach her despite multiple attempts. Copyright 2016 WMC Action News 5. All rights reserved.

The website Breitbart.com posted an article last week that said Wal-Mart was “selling Black Lives Matter clothing and other items,” though the merchandise is actually being sold by Old Glory Merchandise, a music and entertainment apparel dealer out of Connecticut. Chuck Canterbury, the FOP president, wrote to Wal-Mart CEO C. Douglas McMillon Tuesday to advise him that the Wal-Mart website was selling “offensive shirts and sweatshirts,” and “I urge you to prohibit the use of the Wal-Mart name and website for the retail sale of these products.” The Wal-Mart site and Old Glory’s site also sell “Blue Lives Matter” shirts. Canterbury said he understood that a third party was selling the merchandise, but “I am concerned that allowing these articles to be sold in this way will damage your company’s good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers.” Canterbury added, “Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another.” Wal-Mart and Old Glory did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday evening.

Which is the better pick right now -- the pharmacy stock, or the retail behemoth? Cory Renauer (TMFang4apples) Dec 20, 2016 at 8:21AM Shares of retail giants CVS Health Corp. (NYSE:CVS) and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) have moved in opposite directions this year. While the pharmacy stock has given up about 19% this year, the superstore icon has rewarded investors with a 17% gain. Image source: Getty Images. The divergence has plenty scratching their heads. In recent quarters, Wal-Mart has slowed new store openings, but CVS Health's retail footprint ballooned this year as it rebranded over 1,600 pharmacies within Target stores nationwide. Clearly, there's more at play than the simple expansion of physical locations, and investors are right to wonder which stock is the better buy right now. Let's see how the two stack up to determine which comes out ahead. Tough pill to swallow CVS Health investors have watched earnings per share grow a whopping 189% over the past decade, but a recent warning might have their physicians writing new anti-anxiety scripts. During its third-quarter earnings report, management lowered 2016's adjusted earnings guidance range slightly to between $5.77 and $5.83 per share. Guidance provided for 2017 was downright disturbing, as it suggests the bottom line could flatten out with adjusted earnings in the $5.77- to $5.93-per-share range. The guidance revision stems from a projected loss of more than 40 million retail prescriptions next year. This summer, Walgreens Boots Alliance displayed presidential dealmaking skills by steering scores of Blue Cross Blue Shield and Tricare network members away from CVS pharmacies and through its own doors. While the guidance for next year is certainly upsetting, it's important to note that CVS is much more than a simple pharmacy chain. The company runs America's second-largest pharmacy benefit manager, a service that end payers increasingly rely on to manage prescription drug costs. In fact, its pharmacy services segment contributed about 45% of total operating profit recorded in the first nine months of the year, up from about 39% in 2010. Image source: Getty Images. In addition to pharmacy services, CVS Health will ride the trend toward increasing reliance on long-term care facilities as the number of Americans over age 65 skyrockets. Last year it acquired Omnicare, a leading service provider for such facilities, and CVS is still integrating Omnicare's operations. Revenue sources a-changin'? While CVS Health braces for an abrupt slowdown, growth at Wal-Mart has ticked up just 2% in the past five years. A focus adjustment, from the enormous Supercenters that drove growth for decades to little Express stores, basically flopped. Midsized Neighborhood Markets have also been less than impressive. But now, Wal-Mart's e-commerce efforts are beginning to look like as if they could pave the way forward for the struggling company. This summer's $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com may have been the jump-start its online presence needed. Third-quarter e-commerce sales grew 20.6% over the previous year period, which was an impressive acceleration over a year-on-year increase of just 7% in the first quarter. If its online presence is going to help the company grow, it will need to continue putting up double-digit growth for quite some time. Third-quarter e-commerce sales made their largest contribution ever to the U.S. segment, but at just 0.5% of the total, it's like towing a shipping container with a motorcycle. Running the numbers CVS Health's stock is slightly more expensive than Wal-Mart's with respect to trailing earnings. Looking forward, though, it's significantly cheaper at just 13.7 times this year's estimates. CVS PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts With respect to dividends, CVS Health can't hold a candle to Wal-Mart's 43-year history of consecutive raises, but a track record of 13 years of higher payments is nothing to sneeze at, either. In fact, I imagine income investors look past its adolescent distribution to focus on the blazing pace at which it's been raising payments. CVS Dividend data by YCharts Over the past five years, CVS Health has boosted its payout at a stunning 32% annual rate, and during the past 12 months, it has used just 34.8% of profits to make payments to its happy shareholders. In stark contrast, Wal-Mart has barely nudged its payout upward over the past few years but needs to divert a larger proportion of profits to do so. The 2.8% yield Wal-Mart Stores shares offer at recent prices is better than the 2.1% you'd see from CVS Health, but I think you can reasonably expect a better yield on your original investment before too long with the healthcare stock. After all, the retail behemoth's avenue to growth is still blurry, but the pharmacy chain's is well defined. This is why I'm calling CVS Health a much better buy right now.

By now, you may have caught that irresistible Walmart TV spot that features children of all ages doing what they always do on Christmas Day: Shaking their gifts in an attempt to guess what’s inside. The shaking is to the tune of “Shaky Shaky,” the catchy Daddy Yankee song that the rapper wrote months ago -- with no notion of it ever being used in a television commercial.  “Shaky Shaky” has been a viral sensation ever since Yankee, a savvy marketer, set it free, so to speak, not on radio, but via Musical.ly. Back in May, Yankee asked fans on the app to upload their own versions of “Shaky Shaky,” a danceable reggaeton track which, at that point, had no music video. Within 12 hours, more than 10,000 “Shaky Shaky” videos had been uploaded, making the track a global trending topic. Fast-forward six months, and “Shaky Shaky” has already topped Billboard’s Hot Latin Songs chart and caught the ear of many. In fact, the Walmart campaign was conceived around the song, says Olga Reyes, executive creative director of Lopez Negrete Communications, the ad agency that created it. “Music is a key element in the Walmart campaign,” Reyes tells Billboard. “And in this particular spot we needed to tell a story about Christmas morning, about finding the perfect gift and the kids opening the presents. As soon as I heard 'Shaky Shaky,' I could see in my mind the kids shaking those gifts. It conveys the wow moment of kids finding what they want. ‘Shaky Shaky’ became another character in the story.” Having the spot revolve around the song isn’t common, says Fernando Osuna, chief creative officer for Lopez Negrete, which has long worked with Walmart. “We usually don't find music and then come up with stories. Usually we find a story and the music amplifies it. But the moment you look at this spot, you can see everything is perfect.” In order to get the rights to “Shaky Shaky,” the Lopez Negrete team enlisted Creative License, the New York-based company that secures talent and licenses for brands and advertisers. “We saw how many hits the song had on YouTube and we were concerned,” admits Osuna. “But then we said, ‘If we get it, it will be huge.'” Huge indeed. Yankee’s official “Shaky Shaky” video has more than 617 million views on YouTube. The two lyric videos have over 50 million views, and there are several million others from the many, many videos uploaded to YouTube that use it as the soundtrack for countless choreographies. After watching the Walmart commercial, it’s hard to imagine it working with any other music, but Reyes says there was a plan B. “It was a completely different story with different kind of music,” she says. Yankee’s music, however, “really captures the Latin spirit.” FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Comments Magazine Customer Service Subscribe Buy this issue Billboard biz The online extension of Billboard Magazine, billboard.biz is the essential online destination for the music business.

(MagnifyMoney) MagnifyMoney , KHOU 6:08 AM. CST December 21, 2016 Veronica Juneau, 28, of Big Lake, Minn. launched a fundraising campaign to give Ray Belanger, a local Walmart greeter, a special Christmas present. On Dec. 18, 2016, Ray supporters gathered at Jump City in Ostego, Minn. to celebrate. (Photo: Rico Roman for MagnifyMoney, Custom) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST When 28-year-old Veronica Juneau first starting shopping at the Walmart in Elk River, Minn., earlier this year, she was met with a fist bump by Ray Belanger, the designated greeter. In fact, she noticed that every person who walked through the glass doors, whether a child or an adult, was met with a high-five or a joke. “He’s always just so cheery and lively,” says Juneau, who lives in Big Lake and is a full-time student at North Hennepin Community College. “When I’m having a bad day, he makes me feel happy. He doesn’t even try, it’s just who he is.” After a local news station ran a story about Belanger last spring, members of a community Facebook group began to discuss joining forces to do something nice for Belanger. When the holidays came around, Juneau came up with an idea: she would start a crowdfunding campaign on GoFundMe to raise money to give Belanger a special present this Christmas. She started with a goal to raise $2,000. “We want to show just how much he’s impacted the community just by being himself,” explains Juneau. “And because he can’t receive gifts while on the job, I wanted to create an online campaign for people who moved away and miss his spirit, or don’t have time to meet with him outside of Walmart.” A Rocky Start At the end of November, Juneau posted a link to the campaign on the local Facebook group’s message board. But it was a rocky start. Because that group does not allow posts that ask people for money, moderators wanted to remove it. Some group members expressed disapproval of the campaign, arguing that GoFundMe campaigns should be used for people with severe economic hardship or life-threatening medical conditions. “I felt a little discouraged at first, because some people had posted rude comments,” says Juneau. On the upside, a small group of supporters started to share the campaign on their personal social media pages, and it soon began trending on GoFundMe. Within a few hours, there were about 200 shares, then 1,000. In a few days, was shared more than 1,200 times. Since the campaign was created at the end of November, it has raised nearly $1,700 from 86 contributors. “And I’m baffled," says Juneau. "I thought the community might raise maybe a couple hundred dollars, and I never expected it to get as far as it did.” Belanger celebrated with friends and family at a party organized in his honor on Dec. 18, 2016 in Ostego, Minn.   (Photo: Rico Roman for MagnifyMoney, Custom) For his part, 80-year-old Belanger is humbled by the show of support. Before becoming a Walmart greeter two years ago, he worked at an iron scrapyard while juggling other jobs. “It’s in my nature to be friendly,” he told MagnifyMoney. “I like to talk to people, to ask them how they’re doing. I stop them and ask, ‘whose idea was it to shop this lovely evening when it’s snowing?’ I just don’t stand there and look at them. I talk to them and make them happy.” 'I Like to Talk to People' Because Belanger doesn’t have a computer, he’s been concerned about getting the chance to thank everyone who has contributed to the campaign. “I didn’t expect it, but I am appreciating every minute of it,” says Belanger, who has four kids and seven grandkids. “I’ve got to thank all these people somehow.” To give Belanger a chance to thank everyone in person, Juneau and her friend Alyssa Mae DeMers organized a potluck the Sunday before Christmas. Belanger was met by the smiling faces of longtime Walmart customers, family, and friends. Friends and supporters do the greeting for once, welcoming Walmart greeter Ray Belanger at a party organized in his honor on Dec. 18, 2017. Supporters raised $1,700 for Ray through crowdfunding site GoFundMe.com.   (Photo: Rico Roman for MagnifyMoney, Custom) When asked what he plans to do with the generous cash gift, Belanger thought immediately of his wife, Phyllis, who is 75 and retired from cleaning homes and local businesses. “[I’ll] probably put it in a savings account for [my] wife,” he says. A Chance to Connect Juneau recommends those who also want to give to others not to hesitate. “If you think something is worth doing, then do it,” she says. “Because if you don’t get out there and you don’t do anything, you won’t know where the community stands.” Already, she is feeling more connected to the community where she has lived less than two years. She moved to the area in the summer of 2015 from southeast Minnesota with her young son but no other family in the area. “It’s so awesome for the community to come together for a cause,” says Juneau. “So many people have been supportive, by sharing the campaign, and with their nice comments and generous donations. It just goes to show how one man who went above and beyond ‘just doing his job’ can touch people. You affect people every day, whether you realize it or not. People are so genuinely in love with Ray that they just want to give to him.” MagnifyMoney is a price comparison and financial education website, founded by former bankers who use their knowledge of how the system works to help you save money.

Should You? Hedge funds have been dumping their shares of Suncor Energy, Transocean, and Wal-Mart Stores. Not all of these are worth dumping yourself, though. Tyler Crowe, Jason Hall, and Timothy Green (TMFDirtyBird) Dec 20, 2016 at 12:24PM One subset of stocks that gets put under the microscope more than any other is those owned by billionaire hedge fund owners. Investors looking to ride the coattails of these hedge funds will watch every move, and much of their investment theses will be based on whether or not the companies are owned by these effective stock pickers. Recently, billionaire hedge fund owners have been fleeing from Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU), Transocean (NYSE:RIG), and Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT). Does that mean it's time for you to dump these stocks as well? We asked three of our contributors that very question. Here's what they had to say.  Image source: Getty Images. Berkshire moving on from Canadian oil looks like terrible timing Jason Hall (Suncor Energy Inc.): According to the same recent SEC filing disclosing Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) partial Wal-Mart sale, Warren Buffett's company also sold off its entire stake in Canadian oil producer and refiner Suncor Energy. However, instead of trying to divine why Buffett (or, more likely, either Ted Weschler or Todd Combs) sold off the rest of Suncor last quarter, I'll describe why the move looks to have been pretty poor timing in terms of Suncor's prospects.  If you follow oil markets closely, then it's no secret that low oil prices have been especially hard on many Canadian oil producers. This is particularly true for more recently developed oil plays that don't have pipeline infrastructure and must rely on costly crude-by-rail to get product to market. Add in the impact of a recent forest fire, which interrupted both production and distribution from major oil sands producers, and it's been a very tough couple of years.  Still, Suncor is actually in a position of relative strength right now. Over the past year, it has made several moves to improve its output and lower operating costs, securing a majority stake in a major oil sands joint venture, selling off interests in noncore assets, and positioning itself to participate in a potentially huge offshore project in the North Sea. At the same time, the company's refining segment continues to provide stability and steady operating cash flow, absorbing much of the downside of what has been a very weak oil market.  Factor in OPEC's major move to take 1.2 million barrels per day of oil off the market, and now a non-OPEC group of countries committing to join in the cuts, and Suncor's moves have the company positioned to reap huge gains on higher oil prices over the next year.  Add it all up, and Berkshire's decision to sell doesn't look like a good reason to avoid Suncor right now.  Not every stock is sold because it's a bad investment Tyler Crowe (Transocean): Late last quarter, Carl Icahn announced he was trimming his position in rig owner Transocean by 75%. He said he was doing so for tax purposes, and that he still had confidence in management, so we can't really say that this was a vote of no confidence in the company. If Icahn was selling this position in order to reap a tax gain on the realized loss, then it was probably a good time to do so.  Icahn disclosed his initial purchase of Transocean in January 2013. It's pretty much been downhill from there, as the company's stock price has declined more than 70% since that time. RIG data by YCharts. The relationship between Icahn and Transocean hasn't always been an amicable one. Within months of announcing his stake in the company, Icahn was looking to make major changes, including adding his own people to the board, increasing its dividend, and stopping the use of cash flow to pay down debt. Hindsight being what it is, it was probably for the better that the company didn't heed too much of Icahn's advice, since the oil market was only a year away from cratering when he was advocating for sending so much cash flow back to shareholders instead of into the business. One of the big differentiators for rig companies during this downturn has been a strong balance sheet. As far as getting out for tax purposes, his exit couldn't have come at a better time, because the company is starting to look stronger and stronger. As many of its older rigs have gone off contract, the company has retired those rigs and has left itself with a much more modern fleet that will be much better suited to meet the needs of exploration and production companies in the coming years. With the oil market back on the upswing, Transocean is looking like it has a chance to recover well in the coming years.  An eroding moat Tim Green (Wal-Mart Stores): Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has been selling shares of retail giant Wal-Mart all year. Berkshire still holds a meaningful stake in the company, valued at nearly $1 billion as of Sept. 30. But that's down from around $5 billion at the end of 2014. While it's impossible to say for sure why Buffett is selling, he might be second-guessing the sustainability of Wal-Mart's competitive advantages. E-commerce sales continue to grow far faster than total retail sales, and Wal-Mart has been forced in recent years to make major investments in an effort to compete with Amazon.com. The $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com earlier this year was an expensive reminder that Wal-Mart is lagging behind the e-commerce giant. There's hope for Wal-Mart yet. The company is pushing its online grocery service, allowing customers to order online and pick up their groceries at Wal-Mart supercenters for free. A convenience store concept that has a dedicated online grocery pickup lane is being tested in a few locations, and new online fulfillment centers are being built. Wal-Mart is starting from behind, but it's clear that the company is taking e-commerce seriously. Competing with Amazon will be expensive, and that may be the main reason Buffett is dumping his stake. E-commerce is eroding the moat Wal-Mart has built over the decades. Wal-Mart certainly has the potential to succeed in e-commerce and effectively compete with Amazon, but it's far from a sure thing.

(Journal file photo) Print Email Corey McDonald | The Jersey Journal By Corey McDonald | The Jersey Journal The Jersey Journal on December 20, 2016 at 12:58 PM, updated December 23, 2016 at 2:48 PM comments SECAUCUS - Three people were arrested and charged last month after they attempted to pull off a shoplifting scheme at the Walmart here, police say. On Nov. 27, one man and two women were charged with trying to steal six PlayStation consoles valued at $1,791.18 by putting them inside of a kid's toy box and paying for the disguised item, police Capt. Dennis Miller said. This shoplifting attempt may have been a little different, but trying to walk out of a Walmart without paying for goods is far from unique. In the past four months there have been 13 instances of theft or shoplifting at the Secaucus Walmart that warranted a response the town's police. Walmart's loss prevention team, with significant aid from the Secaucus police, has stopped more than $5,000 in merchandise from leaving the store since Aug. 1, according to police reports. Data is not yet available for 2016, but police say that more than 12 percent of all Secaucus Police Department arrests -- 121 -- made last year occurred at Walmart. NOT JUST SECAUCUS But for the frequency that Secaucus police find themselves at Walmart, these numbers are relatively low in comparison to other stores across the country. According to a Tampa Bay Times analysis, law enforcement logged nearly 16,800 calls in one year to Walmart stores in four Florida counties - when, broken down, totals two calls an hour for every hour, seven days a week. Another report from Bloomberg News said local police were called to one of Tulsa, Oklahoma's four Walmart stores nearly 2,000 times, while only being called to the city's four Targets around 300 times, in 2015. "Walmart must stop asking local police departments to do their job and taxpayers to subsidize its security," said Randy Parraz, campaign director of the media campaign, Making Change at Walmart. "The simple solution is for Walmart to do what is right and invest more in under-staffed stores and security." The campaign, run by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union - is launching a new media campaign to "call attention to the amount of shoplifting and other petty crimes that occur at Walmart stores, and the use of police resources to deal with the crime," a press release said. RECENT BUST In the Nov. 27 bust, Secaucus police arrested and charged Raymond Sierra, 20, from Bloomfield; Linda Tirado, 30, from Newark; and Jahaira P. Galleo, 24, of Newark with shoplifting and conspiracy to commit shoplifting for their attempt on Nov. 27. Gallego had an active warrant out of Newark of $300 and her bail was set at $5,000 with a 10 percent option, while Sierra and Tirado were release with summonses. None of the people arrested at the Walmart within the past four months have been Secaucus residents, and while the store is in the rear of a shopping complex far from any residential neighborhood, the store is bringing crime into the town. 'OUTREACH TO LAW ENFORCEMENT' Blake Jackson, the director of corporate communications for Walmart, says that stores are continually investing in people and technology to support the stores, and that they will continue their "outreach to law enforcement in New Jersey and across the country as part of our ongoing commitment to meet our customers' and associates' expectations of a safe and enjoyable shopping experience." He pointed to several preventative initiatives the store has put forth: the "More at the Door" program which brings more employees to the front of the store. The Making Change at Walmart officials argue that more people should be hired to deter thefts, or hire off-duty cops to relieve the burden on local law enforcement. "Different cities have taken different routes to figure this problem out, so we think there are things that can help decrease the burden on local law enforcement," said Meredith Ritchie, a senior communications specialist with Making Change at Walmart. Another program -- the Restorative Justice Program, through a partnership with The Corrective Education Company -- offers first-time, low-risk offenders a chance to make things right by paying for and participating in an educational course in lieu of prosecution. Jackson says there has been a 35 percent reduction in calls to law enforcement agencies nationwide thanks to the controversial program, which is the subject of a lawsut by the San Francisco city attorney because it may violate basic due process. LOOKING TO THE FUTURE There had been talks earlier this year of having a Secaucus police officer permanently positioned inside the Park Plaza Drive super store. Mayor Michael Gonnelli says the town will begin meeting with officials with the store after the holidays in early 2017.

By Holly Cook Roeland Park City councilors were briefed Monday on the $500,000 improvement planned for the city’s Walmart located at 5150 Roe Ave. Replacing signs with updated Walmart logos, interior and exterior painting and remodeling the pharmacy are among the planned upgrades. FROM OUR SPONSORS: The store will also update the garden center fencing and add a small bank counter. The store’s photo lab will be removed. “It’s bringing up the feel of the property…..to a standard appearance for the current Walmarts,” said city administrator Keith Moody. Moody said he expected the improvement requests could be approved by city staff and would not need to go through the city’s planning commission. Roeland Park was preparing for the 5150 Roe Ave. Walmart to close following plans for a much larger Walmart to move into the Mission Gateway. After Walmart dropped out of the Mission Gateway plan in October, the store decided to reinvest in its Roeland Park location. The renovation plans do not include any significant exterior modifications or improvements to landscaping, sidewalks or the parking lot. Moody said if Walmart commits to staying at the location these types of improvements could be eligible for reimbursement through the Community Improvement District fund. Walmart’s lease on the property is set to expire November 2021. Councilor Ryan Kellerman suggested having a Walmart representative meet with councilors to discuss future plans for the store. Moody said he had been in touch with the area’s Walmart representative but that the individual was “not really interested in having their plans discussed publicly.” Moody said the representative would not commit to meeting with the council or the economic development ad hoc committee. “He has indicated that at this point they don’t anticipate doing more than what has been applied for in this building permit for the next five years,” Moody said. Councilor Becky Fast asked if the city could encourage the Walmart landowner to improve the parking lot. “I understand Walmart is only going to do remodeling inside but it’s time for the owner to make some repairs to that parking lot and the aesthetics and to make it more warm and friendly,” Fast said. Fast noted the landowner had done “very little” over the past ten years. Michael Poppa agreed with Fast’s comments and said he would like the landowner to meet with council members. “There is a lot of room for improvement on that site,” he said.

BERNIE DELINSKI/TimesDaily Buy Now Demmorrious Hampton, 5, and his cousin, Kerrington Griffin, 14 months, show off their presents. BERNIE DELINSKI/TimesDaily FLORENCE — Maziyah McCroskey's eyes widened as she watched the conveyor belt move a package of dolls along a Walmart checkout station and into her hands. The 8-year-old flashed a smile, and spoke excitedly about her shopping spree. "I got a Monopoly game, new shoes and that big baby doll set with a lot of babies," Maziyah said. She was among 85 children who enjoyed a shopping spree at the store Sunday in what has become an annual Christmas tradition for Westside Church of Christ in Leighton. For some 16 years, the church has hosted underprivileged children for a church service, then loaded them into a bus for Walmart. Westside member Melvin Whitlock organizes the event, which always is the last Sunday before Christmas. "We're just glad to provide the children this ability to do their own shopping," Whitlock said, as he stood at the front of a long checkout line designated for the church-sponsored spree. Church members marked each name off the list as they checked out. Kimya Abernathy hung around to watch the scene with her daughter, Dekinya, and twin babies Annah and Onnah. She said it is moving to witness such an act of love for others. "Some parents can't afford to get for their kids for Christmas," Abernathy said. "But Melvin and his church stepped up once again." Keyaris Davis' face lit up as the 10-year-old pointed to her shopping cart. "This is good," she said. "I got shoes, plus toys." Sonya Smith said her son has bipolar issues and her daughter has autism, so being able to take part in an organized event like Sunday's spree is a difference maker. "It means a lot," Smith said. "Many of these kids are less fortunate. I've got my hands full, and this comes through big time." Tiffany Boyd laughed while watching her six-year-old son, Jason, dart through the toy aisles. "He's so excited," she said. Jason reached in his shopping cart to show off his findings. "I've got a big gun and an Auburn basketball goal," he said. Whitlock said each child was allotted $45 for the spree. He said the event is designed to make sure they have something for Christmas, but also carries a long-term goal of setting an example as the children grow up. "We want to teach them the spirit of giving and receiving," he said. "One day when they look in the rearview mirror, they'll remember that someone showed them an example of kindness, and they'll want to do the same for others." For Maziyah, that strategy appears to be working already. "I feel very grateful, and this teaches you to be thankful for what you got and help others," she said. bernie.delinski@timesdaily.com or 256-740-5739.

Published Dec 20th, 2016 12:50 pm JJoyner@nwabj.com / @tbarkansas Charles Redfield, executive vice president of food at Walmart U.S., believes success often comes when people take risks. “Take a leap of faith, because it can become very rewarding,” said Redfield, a Bentonville native. “I always say, ‘get comfortable being uncomfortable.’ That is when individuals develop the most.” Redfield began his retail career in the 1980s at the Springdale Sam’s Club. He worked as a part-time cashier during off-hours from his coursework at the University of Arkansas. Twenty-five years later, he became a C-level executive for Sam’s Club, and now leads the $167 billion grocery division at Walmart U.S. Redfield has spent 24 years of his 27-year retail career working for Wal-Mart Stores, and he praises the culture. “We are constantly improving, growing and innovating,” he said. “But, our respect for the individual, service to our customers, our strive for excellence and acting with integrity has only strengthened.” Redfield was senior vice president of merchandising in fresh/health and wellness for Sam’s Club when he was featured in the Northwest Arkansas Business Journal’s Forty Under 40 in 2007. Since then, he served for two years as chief merchandising officer at Asda (2010-2012), Walmart’s U.K.-based subsidiary, then returned to Sam’s Club in the U.S. as chief merchandising officer. He took on his current leadership role at Walmart U.S. in 2015. “Over the last 10 years, I have been fortunate that my breadth of responsibility has continued to grow. And with each changing position, I have needed to adapt to the demands of each one of them,” Redfield said. “The interesting thing is, the key to success has been the same in each role: It’s about people and surrounding yourself with a good team. You, as an individual, can accomplish many things, but a successful team can accomplish exponentially more.” Charles Redfield, executive vice president of food at Walmart U.S. His favorite thing about his work is the people. “It really makes things enjoyable. But, the other thing is that I am constantly challenged day in and day out. There is never a boring day,” he said. “As for my least favorite thing, it has to be when I don’t get to spend as much time in our stores with our customers and associates,” said Redfield, whose early years in the company were on the operations side. After college, he became store manager and pursued work in store operations when he took a position at Canada-based Hudson Bay in 1998. However, several years after returning to Sam’s Club in 2003, he switched gears to merchandising. While Redfield was born and raised in Bentonville, where he now lives, his career has prompted him to move 10 times within and outside the United States. “I realize that it is a big world out there, but it’s also very small at the same time,” Redfield said. “I have learned that retail is very similar around the world. Customers want great value — both price and quality — and great service, when it is given to them with simplicity.” When Redfield moved to the U.K. for two years to work at Asda, he brought his family with him. And while he said both the professional and personal aspects of the experience were “fantastic, there is no place like home.” He and his wife Sue have two sons, Matthew, 13, who was born in Bentonville, and Avery, 17, who was born in Canada, but the family moved back to Arkansas when he was very young. Bentonville is home, Redfield said, but now he’s looking forward to the next stages for the family. “What’s next for me is to make sure I see both of my boys through high school and on to college and help set them up for success in life. Sue and I are excited about what the future holds for both them and us,” Redfield said. Redfield joined Walmart U.S.’s grocery business at a pivotal time for the company, as it remains a giant in the industry but faces competition not only from grocers, but from other discount stores and e-commerce businesses. “As for Walmart grocery, we want to grow,” Redfield said. “And to do that, we have to remain focused on customers and how they are changing. They have high expectations, and it’s our job to exceed those.” Author Bio: See latest posts Comments 21shares Talk Business & Politics by email Arkansas headlines delivered to you on demand Email address Statewide Newsletter Northeast Arkansas Newsletter Fort Smith Newsletter Northwest Arkansas Newsletter Submit Opinion Michael Tilley Riff Raff: Calling the system an SOB Ancil Lea HIPAA audits and redacting Martin Thoma Can you brand sand?

Justin Barkley, 38, of Dryden, was arrested on December 8 after allegedly shooting and killing UPS driver William Schumacher, 52, of Candor in the parking lot of the Wal-Mart, then running over Schumacher with his vehicle. In court on Monday, Barkley attempted to plead guilty, and told a judge, "I shot and killed Donald Trump purposely, intentionally and very proudly," The Ithaca Voice reported. According to the website, Barkley said he knew Trump would be at the Wal-Mart, and went to the store intending to kill him. Barkley told the court he understood the difference between mistaking someone for Trump and claiming that he actually killed Trump, and said nothing could convince him that he had killed anyone other than the president-elect. The judge rejected his guilty plea, and Assistant D.A. Eliza Filipowski requested a mental evaluation for Barkley. After shooting Schumacher, Barkley engaged in a standoff with police at his home for several hours before surrendering. Schumacher had been a seasonal driver for UPS for just two years. Barkley is due back in court in January.

(Ithaca Police Department) BY Elizabeth Elizalde NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday, December 20, 2016, 4:01 PM An Ithaca man accused of fatally shooting a UPS driver outside a Walmart claimed he shot and killed Donald Trump during a court appearance Monday. Justin Barkley, 38, stood before Judge John Rowley and said he knew where President-elect Donald Trump would be on Dec 8. He then waited for him outside of a Walmart where he said he allegedly killed him, according to the Ithaca Voice. "I shot and killed Donald Trump purposely, intentionally and very proudly," Barkley said during his arraignment. Ithaca police and Barkley engaged in an eight-hour standoff on Dec. 8 where they arrested him for fatally shooting 52-year-old William Schumacher and for firing shots at officers. Trump tweets that Clinton lost due to focusing on 'wrong states' Barkley was indicted for second-degree murder and menacing a police officer. Barkley also told the court that he recognized the difference between mistaking a person for Trump and saying that he killed him. Asked whether any evidence could suggest that he killed a person that was not Trump, he answered, “I hope not.” He tried to enter a guilty plea, but Judge Rowley denied it after he made the Trump allegations. “The judge would not accept his plea of guilty and instead ordered him to a 730 examination — an order directing psychiatrists to determine whether the defendant is capable of standing trial,” Barkley's attorney, James Baker told the Daily News. De Blasio launches campaign to get N.Y. signed up for Obamacare Evaluations could take place in the jail or he could be transferred to a hospital based on the psychiatrist’s recommendation, he said. Baker expects the process could last until mid-February. Asked why the judge ordered Barkley to undergo evaluations, Barkley said that he “felt uncomfortable taking his plea without having the examination done first.” “If the judge decides to move forward, he would complete the arraignment and depending what the plea is, it might be resolved or it might go to trial,” he said.

Ithaca police and Barkley engaged in an eight-hour standoff on Dec. 8 where they arrested him for fatally shooting 52-year-old William Schumacher and for firing shots at officers. Trump tweets that Clinton lost due to focusing on 'wrong states' Barkley was indicted for second-degree murder and menacing a police officer. Barkley also told the court that he recognized the difference between mistaking a person for Trump and saying that he killed him. Asked whether any evidence could suggest that he killed a person that was not Trump, he answered, “I hope not.” He tried to enter a guilty plea, but Judge Rowley denied it after he made the Trump allegations. “The judge would not accept his plea of guilty and instead ordered him to a 730 examination — an order directing psychiatrists to determine whether the defendant is capable of standing trial,” Barkley's attorney, James Baker told the Daily News. De Blasio launches campaign to get N.Y. signed up for Obamacare Evaluations could take place in the jail or he could be transferred to a hospital based on the psychiatrist’s recommendation, he said. Baker expects the process could last until mid-February. Asked why the judge ordered Barkley to undergo evaluations, Barkley said that he “felt uncomfortable taking his plea without having the examination done first.” “If the judge decides to move forward, he would complete the arraignment and depending what the plea is, it might be resolved or it might go to trial,” he said.

But activism is not really a part of its brand. Many were subsequently surprised to find Black Lives Matter gear on the retailer’s website. Customers browsing products on Walmart’s Marketplace, a digital store where third-party vendors can sell their goods through Walmart, were shocked to discover that the international retailer was carrying merchandise for the anti-police brutality movement Black Lives Matter. The slogans on the shirts range from a straightforward “Black Lives Matter” to a sweatshirt with the words “Bulletproof” written on the front. Old Glory, the third party vendor selling through Walmart’s website, provides a wide range of shirts with generic slogans thrown on them from “Girls just wanna have guns” to “OMG Becky,” “All Lives Matter,” “Bye Felicia” and even “Blue Lives Matter.” #Walmart warns workers not to use app helping them understand company's labor rules https://t.co/ImMDSyntSKpic.twitter.com/lrXTIqWj5V— RT America (@RT_America) November 15, 2016 Additionally, given that Old Glory’s business model appears to be centered around printing phrases on shirts that can be purchased cheaply in bulk, there is little connection between them and the Black Lives Matter movement. Blue Lives Matter, an organization for bolstering the image of law enforcement, complained that Walmart was stocking its shelves with Black Lives Matter merchandise, despite it only being available online through the third party vendor. Never the less, conservative twitter responded to the news that Black Lives Matter by making calls to boycott Walmart until it removes the offending garments from their non-existent shelves.

Suburbs Naperville Sun Naperville Crime Naperville man arrested for eighth time this year Nicholas Ducato Naperville Police Department / Handout Nicholas Ducato Nicholas Ducato (Naperville Police Department / Handout) Bill BirdContact ReporterNaperville Sun Privacy Policy A Naperville man has been arrested for the eighth time this year, his most recent charges related to shoplifting incident in which an employee of a local discount store was assaulted. Nicholas Ducato, 41, of the 800 block of Corday Avenue, has been arrested or ticketed at least 40 times since 1992 by area law enforcement agencies, according to DuPage County court records. Ducato, 41, lives in the 800 block of Corday Avenue, in the AMLI at Naperville apartment complex. He was most recently arrested at 10:15 a.m. Thursday, following an incident at the Walmart SuperCenter, at 2552 W. 75th St., according to his court file. In the most recent case, Ducato was confronted by a store security worker at the Walmart SuperCenter, 2552 W. 75th St., while allegedly trying to walk away with more than $500 worth of assorted, unspecified merchandise, records said. He threatened to harm the security worker, records said. Ducato also is charged with a Nov. 24 crime in which he allegedly "stole a number of power and hand tools" valued at just over $200 from a store, Naperville police Cmdr. Jason Arres said. Although Arres declined to name the business, a court file said it was the Walmart SuperCenter. Two of Ducato's other run-ins with the law this year occurred Jan. 25, according to court records. He allegedly took four cans of Red Bull energy drink from the Walgreens store at 1779 Sequoia Road and a buck hunting knife valued at $50 from the Menards home improvement center at 715 Fort Hill Drive. Ducato was arrested again March 20 on a charge of criminal trespass to property for allegedly going to the Walgreens after having been banned from the premises. He was charged again with same crime on July 14, when allegedly returning to the same store, records said. He also was arrested July 2 after trying to shoplift clothing, paint and a wire brush from the Menards store, records said. The most recent retail theft charge against Ducato is a felony. The other seven counts are misdemeanors. Ducato's court record includes a 1993 conviction for resisting or obstructing a police officer in Aurora; a 1995 conviction for battery in Naperville; separate 1995 convictions for trespassing in Naperville and Aurora; and a 2000 Downers Grove battery conviction. Ducato is being held in DuPage County jail on a combined bail of $4,750, according to jail records. He is scheduled to appear in court Dec. 27 in connection with the alleged Walmart crimes and on Jan. 11 in the earlier cases. wbird@tribpub.com Copyright © 2017, Naperville Sun Crime Theft Law Enforcement Naperville Questions about elite golf course on the South Side Food stamp program faces uncertain future Visiting Chicago Breaking Sports Trending Opinion Suburbs Entertainment Business Advertising 4°

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Tom Jackman December 20, 2016 Follow @TomJackmanWP A protester wearing a “Black Lives Matter” t-shirt in Minnesota last summer at a demonstration after the death of Philando Castile. Similar, but not identical, t-shirts and sweatshirts are being offered for sale on Walmart’s website. (Reuters/Eric Miller) UPDATE, Wed., 6 p.m.: The Fraternal Order of Police has now sent a similar request to Amazon.com. Amazon did not respond to a request for comment. ORIGINAL POST: The president of the national Fraternal Order of Police, the country’s largest police organization, on Tuesday asked Walmart to stop selling t-shirts and sweatshirts which say “Black Lives Matter” and “Bulletproof” on the department store’s website. On Tuesday night, Walmart said it would remove the shirts which say “Bulletproof,” but not the “Black Lives Matter” shirts. “Black Lives Matter” is a slogan and protest movement which emerged after the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012 and police-involved slayings in 2014, and is seen as offensive by many in law enforcement. The website Breitbart.com posted an article last week which said that Walmart was “selling Black Lives Matter clothing and other items,” though the merchandise is actually being sold through Walmart’s website by Old Glory Merchandise, a music and entertainment apparel dealer out of Connecticut. Chuck Canterbury, the FOP president, wrote to Walmart CEO C. Douglas McMillon Tuesday to advise him that the Walmart website was selling “offensive shirts and sweatshirts,” and “I urge you to prohibit the use of the Walmart name and website for the retail sale of these products.” The Walmart site and Old Glory’s site also sell “Blue Lives Matter” shirts. Canterbury said he understood that a third party was selling the merchandise, but “I am concerned that allowing these articles to be sold in this way will damage your company’s good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers.” Canterbury added, “Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another.” Walmart issued a statement Tuesday night saying that, “Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise. After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the ‘bulletproof’ reference.” The “bulletproof” shirts say “Bulletproof” with “Black Lives Matter” beneath that line. Chris Kappelman, the head buyer for Old Glory, said Wednesday that Walmart had not contacted his company before removing some of their product. But he noted that Old Glory sells more than a half million shirts, including “All Lives Matter” and “All Matter Matters,” and they were not looking to offend anyone. He said they had removed the “Bulletproof” shirts from other third-party sites as well. Jim Pasco, the executive director of the police union in Washington, said the issue was raised by union members who felt Walmart was selling anti-police items. “There are a lot of people who feel too many guns are sold,” Pasco said. “Why not speak out against things that might be seen as fomenting violence, rather than things that commit violence?” Canterbury’s letter is below:   local true-crime Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

HAVERHILL — A shopping trip to the Plaistow Walmart was like nothing these children had ever experienced before. One hundred children attending the after-school care program at the YMCA in Haverhill got an early Christmas present from the owners of a chain of Dunkin' Donut shops. They were told they could select gifts at the Plaistow Walmart for themselves, or for anyone they wished, just as long as they left the store happy and smiling. "This is really exciting," said Rylee Spear, 9. "When my mother takes me here I see all the toys and I wish I could get one, but she usually tells me we are just there to get soap or something like that." The Cafua Family Charitable Foundation, the charitable arm of the Methuen-based Cafua Management Company, the largest privately owned Dunkin’ Donuts franchisee in the U.S., helped spread holiday cheer by presenting each child with $100 Walmart gift cards. Company owners, brothers Mark, David and Gregory Cafua told children they could buy whatever they wanted at the Plaistow Walmart, where they had arranged for a special shopping night on Monday. Mark Cafua said he and his brothers were particularly touched after learning about some of the children. "We have six children from one family who recently lost their father," he said. About 70 or so Cafua employees along with YMCA staff waited with shopping carts decorated with green and red helium balloons, and along with Santa Claus, welcomed the children as they disembarked two school buses.  From 4 to 6 p.m., each child was paired with a Cafua Management Company employee, with CEO Mark Cafua leading the charge and Y regional Executive Director Tracy Fuller and YMCA of the North Shore CEO Chris Lovasco joining in to lend a hand. "In my 20 years working for the nonprofit YMCA, this is one of the coolest ways to give back to the community," Lovasco said. The store's toy department began to swell with starry-eyed children, some of whom brought wish lists and had a good idea of what they wanted, while others marveled at everything on the shelves, but often had a hard time deciding on what to choose. Shopping carts rapidly filled with toys, such as Pokemon characters and Num Noms Art Cart playsets, which Ariela Jimenez, 8, picked out for herself.  "I'm also shopping for my mom and dad," Ariela said. Isaac Acevedo, 9, studied the image on a box of Lego pieces before his attention was drawn to Star Wars toys. "I like this," Isaac said about a foot-tall Darth Vader action figure he picked out.  Their adult shopping guides kept track of how much they had left on their gift cards. "I'm looking for fashion boots," Angela Tejada told her guide. Caleb Carroll, 7, selected a Five Night's at Freddy's plush cupcake along with two Yo-kai watches and accessories. "I never had $100 before," Caleb said. "I almost couldn't sleep last night thinking about coming here." While the other little shoppers were wandering from aisle to aisle, Isabella Lombard, 6, was trying out a bicycle with training wheels. "My bike is rusty and doesn't work very well," said Isabella, who noted that she was also in need of a bicycle helmet. Jyzaiah Ferreira, 12, reached for an XBox Live gift card for himself, then asked his adult shopping guide how much he would have left as he wanted to buy Christmas presents for his mother, father and younger brother. "This has never happened to me before," Jyzaiah said. "I was going to use my birthday money to buy presents, but now I can keep saving it." Samantha Ehlers, 7, asked her shopping guide if she had enough left to donate $35 to a charity after picking out a Disney Lion Guard Training Lair Playset, some Squinkies Do Drops characters and a Little Live Pets Tweet Talking Bird for herself, in addition to a Dinosaur Train character she planned to donate to the Toys for Tots program. "I want to donate to a charity, but I'm not sure which one," Samantha said. Some children wandered into the footwear and clothing departments, such as Ellie Cosme, 10, who was busy picking out a set of pajamas and slippers for herself while her younger brother Gabriel had just about finished filling a shared shopping cart with toys. "I was good all year and at my parent teacher conference, my mom said she was very proud of me," Ellie said before turning her attention to gifts she planned to get for her parents. Mark Cafua said his company operates about 300 Dunkin' Donut franchise locations throughout New England and Florida, including one on River Street near Westgate Plaza and another at 20 Plaistow Road, both in Haverhill. "The goal of our 100 for 100 program is to spread joy, especially to the youngest members of our communities, during this most special time of year," said Mark Cafua. "We truly value our partnership with the YMCA of the North Shore, as it has provided us with the opportunity to not only reach those most in need of Christmas cheer, but also to engage our employees in meaningful programs within their own communities." Cafua said that he and his brothers have hosted similar shopping sprees for deserving children in other states where they operate, but this was the first time for Haverhill.  He said his company partnered with the Plaistow Walmart as it was a good fit for the children, who had expressed interest in not only toys, but in clothing and household items many of them planned to give as gifts on Christmas. Fuller said the YMCAs mission and purpose as a community organization is to meet the ever-growing needs of individuals, children and families all year round. "The holidays are especially important as we explore additional ways to help those in need,” Fuller said. “We are so grateful for Cafua Management and this wonderful 100 for 100 event. We appreciate their incredible support of so many of our programs, including camp, road races, and our financial assistance program. Their generosity is a true testament to their commitment to joining us in strengthening the communities we serve.”  Leading up to the event, the children created wish lists during their Y after school program. Fuller said Walmart management was helpful in assisting the Y and Cafua teams to ensure a smooth and fun experience for everyone involved.

From anonymous donations to charitable flash mobs, here are 20 such stories from this holiday season. 1. MALL SANTA LEARNS SIGN LANGUAGE SO THAT HE CAN COMMUNICATE WITH ALL KIDS Every kid deserves to tell Santa exactly what he or she wants for Christmas, but deaf children can have a difficult time communicating with their local St. Nick. Not kids in Racine, Wisconsin: The Santa at Racine’s Regency Mall knows sign language. He signs with kids who are hearing impaired, so that he can ask them—and they can tell him—what they want for Christmas. Because the warm fuzzy feelings of the holidays don’t just come from getting the right present—they come from feeling like part of a loving, inclusive community. 2. MOM BATTLING CANCER IS SURPRISED WITH A FLASH MOB DONATION When Amanda Kofoed, a 30-year-old Idaho woman, discovered that she had stage 3 Hodgkin’s lymphoma earlier this fall, she had to put her teaching degree on hold and prepare for six months of chemotherapy treatments. When she worried aloud to friends about her lack of insurance, as well as the future of her four young children, a group called the PRAYnksters (which is known for staging random acts of kindness) stepped in with a plan. They took Amanda and her husband, Clint, to a coffee shop, ostensibly to help them film a GoFundMe video. But as the camera rolled, nearly 200 children and adults flooded the coffee shop, all piling cash on the table as Amanda and her husband fought back tears. Amanda received more than $13,000 that day, and her GoFundMe has more than doubled its goal amount thus far. 3. “LAYAWAY ANGEL” PAYS OFF NEARLY $200,000 IN BALANCES AT WALMART An anonymous angel visited three Pennsylvania Walmarts this month, paying out thousands of dollars at each location to clear strangers’ layaway balances. In the last two weeks, the donor has left $74,000 in Harrisburg; $46,000 in Lebanon County; and another $46,000 in Everett, for a total of $166,000 of erased debt. “When customers quietly pay off others’ layaway items, we’re reminded of how good people can be,” a Walmart representative told ABC27 News. “The joy that comes from these transactions extends well beyond dollars and cents. We’re honored to be a small part in these random acts of kindness.” 4. RESTAURANT OFFERS FREE CHRISTMAS MEALS TO LONDON'S ELDERLY AND HOMELESS POPULATIONS Shish Restaurant/Facebook The holidays will be a little bit brighter this year for some of London’s lonelier residents, thanks to a Turkish restaurant opening its doors on Christmas Day. Shish Restaurant in southeast London posted a note on its window in November with the message: “No one eats alone on a Christmas Day! We are here to sit with you … Any homeless or elderly are welcomed.” The restaurant’s owner got the idea to offer a free three-course meal to those with nowhere else to go when an elderly woman walked into his eatery last month. She was looking for someone to help her close her window, and also mentioned that she would be spending Christmas alone this year. Inspired to help her and others like her, the restaurant staff shared the message that they would be welcoming the community’s homeless and elderly members on Christmas Day. Many people were touched by the story; so far, approximately 50 people have volunteered to cook, clean, and drive people to the restaurant. 5. LIBRARY GIFT-WRAPPING EVENTS RAISE MONEY FOR CHARITY Here’s a solution that benefits the gift-wrapping-challenged and charity to boot: At two libraries, teens are wrapping gifts to raise money for charitable causes. The Fairborn Library in Fairborn, Ohio held a “Gift Wrap Extravaganza” on December 19 to benefit the Fairborn Food Pantry, and on December 15 and 16 at the Lane Memorial Library in Hampton, New Hampshire, teens from two local schools wrapped gifts in exchange for donations to benefit charities End 68 Hours of Hunger and the NHSPCA. 6. HOSPITAL WORKER SAVES ALL YEAR IN ORDER TO BUY TOYS FOR SICK CHILDREN ABC Breaking News | Latest News Videos Each Christmas for the past eight years, Jessie Tenyani, a cafeteria worker at Chicago’s Advocate Trinity Hospital, has bought thousands of dollars worth of toys for all of the children at the hospital, the state’s largest pediatric care facility. She sets aside part of her paycheck each month, and this year, she took Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday off from the hospital, rented a U-Haul, and bought $5000 worth of dolly buggies, electric keyboards, soccer balls, and other toys to distribute to kids of all ages at Christmas. “I feel so blessed to have this opportunity to serve these children,” Tenyani told Good Morning America. "I feel great and I feel at peace because what I do is to put a smile on the face of a child who is going through so much, whatever the pain they might go through." 7. SECRET SANTA PAYS OFF LUNCH BALANCES The spirit of the season is alive and well at HW Good Elementary School in Herminie, Pennsylvania. Earlier this month, a generous secret Santa wrote the school a check for more than $900 to clear the overdue lunch balances of 44 children. The only thing the do-gooder asked for in return was to remain anonymous. “Sometimes, all we see are the sad things going on in the world, so it's really, really nice to know there are great people out there who would give up their things to help others," the school’s principal, Amy Larcinese, told ABC News. 8. WESTJET THROWS PARTY FOR PEOPLE WHO LOST HOMES IN WILDFIRES WestJet/Facebook It has been over seven months since the Fort McMurray wildfire in Canada devastated about 20 percent of the homes in the area, but there’s still a lot of healing and rebuilding to do. The airline company WestJet generously stepped in to provide the people of Fort McMurray with some much-needed holiday cheer. The airline threw a Christmas party for the town’s residents that was stocked with all the fixings of a great time: 500 stockings, 300 pounds of candy, and 348 parachutes holding special gifts inside. Nearly 50 WestJet employees—who were moonlighting as elves—arrived to help make the party a success. According to WestJet, 826 Fort Murray citizens took part in the celebration. 9. LOCAL BUSINESS GIVES WOMAN A NEW ROOF FOR CHRISTMAS The roof of Cathy Barker’s home in Jackson, Tennessee is falling apart. Barker, a longtime employee of the Kroger grocery chain, has been battling cancer and hasn’t had the money to repair it. Now she won’t have to: In early December, representatives from the roofing manufacturers at Reed’s Metals surprised Barker at work with the news that out of 100 applicants, she had won the company’s “Covering our Community” award, and they’d install her new roof—worth as much as $6000—before Christmas. Her sons, who’d nominated her for the award, hugged her, and her co-workers cheered. “It’s really great,” a teary Barker told WBBJ 7 Eyewitness News. Barker isn’t the only one who will receive a free roof from Reed’s Metals, which has 10 locations in five states. The company says it will provide a free roof to five others, including Baldwyn, Mississippi resident Bobbie Lou Hill. 10. SHELTER EMPLOYEES WILL DELIVER ADOPTED ANIMALS ON CHRISTMAS MORNING   Williamson County Animal Center/Facebook Getting a pet on Christmas morning is an incredible experience for any animal lover, but it can be hard to orchestrate the sudden arrival of a new dog or cat. In Franklin, Tennessee, local shelter employees are more than happy to serve as Santa’s elves. Staff members at the Williamson County Animal Center have volunteered to get up early on Christmas morning and deliver any animals adopted between December 17 and December 24, making sure that lucky pet-parents-to-be get the best Christmas surprise imaginable. 11. “FOOD FOR FINES” PROGRAMS FORGIVE LIBRARY AND PARKING FEES IN EXCHANGE FOR FOOD BANK DONATIONS Cities across the country are turning delinquent fees into charitable donations with “food for fines” programs. The concept began in Lexington, Kentucky two years ago, when the city offered citizens a sweet holiday deal: donate 10 cans of nonperishable food and get $15 off a parking ticket. The program was a huge success, netting more than 6000 items for a local food bank. This year, officials say, they’re on track to beat that record. Parking enforcement offices and libraries across the country have taken up the torch, swapping overdue fees and parking fines for canned corn and tuna. “It’s wonderful to see organizations like LEXPARK engage with our food bank in creative ways to fight hunger and deliver hope,” one food bank executive told Kentucky Forward. 12. FAMILY DELIVERS RECORD NUMBER OF GIFTS TO RONALD MCDONALD HOUSE In 2015, Marion and Jason Sanford spent nearly six months living at the Ronald McDonald House in Saskatoon, Canada, while their 5-year-old son Rhett underwent surgery following an ATV crash on their family farm. Rhett’s 6-year-old brother, Blaine, was also involved in the crash and tragically died on the way to the hospital. Last December, after Rhett made a slow but full recovery, the family began a “new Christmas tradition” of donating toys to the place that showed them so much kindness during their time of need. This year, Marion and Jason teamed up with Innovation Credit Union to up the ante: They established 28 drop-off locations across the province, where people could leave donations. As a result, the family filled an entire Mack truck with gifts—the most the Saskatoon Ronald McDonald House has ever received. Of her charitable spirit, Marion told CBC News, "Part of the reason I do this is because I want my son [Blaine] to be proud of me. He would be so excited to be part of this.” 13. MASSACHUSETTS COMMUNITY DECKS THE HALLS FOR A WIDOW IN NEED After the passing of her husband in February, Amesbury, Massachusetts, resident Jeanne Hallisey couldn’t muster the energy to decorate her house for Christmas. “I wanted the lights up but didn’t have any holiday spirit at all,” Hallisey told the Daily News of Newburyport. Hallisey solicited help stringing lights and garlands on Facebook, and was overjoyed when dozens of neighbors—armed with coffee, doughnuts, and hand warmers—answered her call. Included in the do-gooders were a handful of players on the Amesbury High School football team and an electrician who made sure all the wiring was safe. 14. SHIRTLESS RUGBY PLAYERS RAISE MONEY FOR CHARITY IN BELFAST Bare-chested members of the Bangor Rugby Club sang carols at Corn Market in Belfast, Northern Ireland earlier this month to raise money for Action Cancer and other charities. In the video above, you can hear coins dropping into donation bins and see a particularly animated “conductor” leading them along. The club hopes to raise about $5000 for charity—which is nothing to shake a Santa hat at. 15. BEST BUY WORKERS CHIP IN TO BUY A WII U FOR A LOCAL TEEN Employees at a Best Buy in Valley Stream, New York recently pulled off a sweet game plan. After the staff noticed that a local teen made daily trips to their location just to play one of the Nintendo Wii U systems on display, they chipped in to get him a console of his own, CNN reported. “Consider it an early Christmas present," one employee told the speechless teen when they revealed the $300 gift. The group also added a new copy of Super Smash Bros., a game he often plays in store—and a ride home. According to Inside Edition, the teen was nervous and making the trek home with his expensive gift. 16. STUDENTS COLLECT GIFTS FOR SENIOR CITIZENS Be a Santa to a Senior, Pinellas County Florida/Facebook Students at Culleoka Unit School in Culleoka, Tennessee are organizing a gift drive for seniors living in local nursing homes. They’re collecting unwrapped gifts right in their K-12 school, located in central Tennessee. Among the suggested donations: adult coloring books, puzzles, toiletries, robes, blankets, stuffed animals, and radios. Nowhere near Culleoka and want to bring some joy to a senior this holiday season? Google is your friend. There are similar programs across the country, including the Share the Love campaign in Thousand Oaks, California; a gift drive in North Fulton, Georgia, for elderly Meals on Wheels participants; and the Adopt a Senior program in the metro New York City region. There’s also the national “Be a Santa to a Senior” program, administered by Home Instead Senior Care. Its program in Delaware could really use your help: It’s about 1500 gifts short of its goal. 17. STOLEN DONATION LEADS TO A MUCH LARGER DONATION Earlier this month, Melissa McMonigle, an English teacher at Ohio’s Northmont High School, was shocked when she discovered that $164 of the $194 her students had raised for a local family in need had been stolen right from her desk. “I was so sad and so disheartened,” McMonigle said. “And my students were angry when they found out.” While that easily could have been the end of the story, what began as a theft turned into a community-wide act of kindness when, according to McGonigle, “Within a 24-hour period, teachers started handing me money in the parking lot. Students who aren’t even [in my classes] started handing me money the hallways. There were parents who came into the main office and asked if they could give money to Miss McMonigle for the needy family. It was happening all day long.” As of December 9, McMonigle's students and colleagues had raised more than $800. 18. TEXAS POLICE DEPARTMENT ISSUES UNUSUAL TRAFFIC CITATIONS Imgur Police in Godley, Texas, are offering a fast track off the naughty list this holiday season. In lieu of fines for minor traffic violations, Mashable reports that officers are handing out “tickets” asking recipients to donate presents to the police department’s toy drive. Police chief Jason Jordan told Mashable the department has “probably handed out a couple hundred” so far, and added that he's currently figuring out a way to carry the program through to the New Year with clothing and school supply donations. 19. POLICE DEPARTMENT PAYS IT FORWARD When 6-year-old Landon Naumann’s bicycle was recently stolen, he and his mom went to the police station to report the crime. The officer who took the report thought the boy looked familiar—and then he realized why: Landon had previously made a visit to the local police station to drop off goodie bags for the local police force to thank them for all that they do for the local community. There was even a picture of Landon and his goodie bags on the wall. So the police officers reached into their own pockets to purchase a new bike for the boy, which they presented to him as a birthday gift. 20. TEENAGER BUILDS LIGHT DISPLAY TO BENEFIT MAKE A WISH While a charitable spirit at any age is something to be admired, there’s something extra special about a young do-gooder—and that’s just what 18-year-old Jordan Maywald is. The Austin, Texas high school senior tapped into the holiday spirit by creating an elaborate, 50,000 light display at his home. But this wasn’t a case of Maywald simply trying to emulate Clark Griswold: He posted a Make-A-Wish donation box outside his home, so that in addition to admiring his twinkling handiwork, those who come to gawk at the display can also make a donation to the nonprofit organization. “There's no better feeling than giving money to them for children who are ill so they can go on a vacation or something they want it's just very heartwarming to us,” Maywald said. He’s hoping to raise $5000 this holiday season.

For Lynn Weaver of Greensburg, the annual Shop With a Cop event is a chance for her three grandchildren, who recently lost their mother, to begin a return to normalcy. “It's wonderful. It's a big help,” Weaver said through tears as she and others waited at the Mt. Pleasant Wal-Mart for their children and grandchildren to be paired with a local police officer and begin picking out $150 in Christmas gifts. “I want a car,” said her youngest grandchild, 6-year-old Eli. This is the eighth year for Westmoreland County Shop With a Cop, and it's always a rewarding experience, according to Greensburg state police spokesman Trooper Steve Limani. “A lot of times, it's kids who have been through something traumatic or lost someone,” Limani said. “I don't care if it's a little kid, someone in junior high or high school. The idea isn't just to take them Christmas shopping but also to develop a relationship and show them that we're here in the community and we care.” State police and officers from the California University of Pennsylvania, Scottdale, Mt. Pleasant and the Westmoreland County Sheriff's Department took about two dozen children shopping in Mt. Pleasant. Officers took another group of children shopping Monday at the Belle Vernon store. Limani organizes a number of fundraisers each year to help pay for the gift vouchers, and local businesses help sponsor the event. Employees from the Mt. Pleasant Wal-Mart raised about $2,000 toward 2016 shopping vouchers, and Somerset Trust bank supplied treats for children and parents. Wal-Mart also provides winter coats to every child who needs one. Sherry Brunot of Scottdale brought her five grandchildren. “For these guys, it's boosting their self-esteem and morale,” she said as 4-year-old Isaac looked over the Paw Patrol toys he'd already picked out. “They've been through a lot, and this is a great experience for them.” Wal-Marts in Latrobe, Greensburg, Murrysville and Irwin will host Shop With a Cop events Tuesday and Wednesday. This year, the program will supply 200 to 300 children with holiday gifts through the growing program, Limani said. “The first year, I was only able to raise about $50,” he said. “Then we graduated to (supplying) winter coats, and now we're able to give every kid a $150 voucher.” For more, see PAShopWithACop.org.

A grisly discovery at a Wal-Mart in Albuquerque highlights a crime wave at Wal-Mart stores across the country.  Albuquerque police reportedly found a decapitated body behind a Wal-Mart early Saturday. The man's body also had its genitalia removed, KOAT-TV reports.  Oklahoma man found decapitated behind Albuquerque Wal-Mart Sources told KOAT-TV that they believe the victim was killed elsewhere and dumped at the store. Violent crimes routinely happen in and around Wal-Mart stores across the country.  On Sunday, police in Santa Ana, Calif., found a man stabbed to death at a Wal-Mart , and a person was shot in front of an Atlanta-area Wal-Mart.  Bloomberg magazine recently profiled the Tulsa Police Department's struggle with its local Wal-Mart stores. Tulsa police investigated 2,000 crimes at four Tulsa-area Wal-Marts in 2015. By comparison, police were called to Tulsa's four Target stores only about 300 times.  An investigation by WFAA-TV (Channel 8) this fall found that rampant crime at Wal-Mart stores also burdens North Texas police departments.  The WFAA investigation revealed that Wal-Mart stores were the top police response locations for the cities of Fort Worth, Carrollton, Garland and McKinney.  Last week, a group affiliated with the United Food and Commercial Workers Union cited the WFAA study in its campaign to urge cities to begin fining Wal-Mart stores for excessive petty crime calls.  It is unclear whether local leaders will be compelled to start fining Wal-Mart or take a lesson from Dallas, which in 2011 stopped responding to retail theft calls under $50.

Ugly sweaters are here to stay and have become big sellers for mainstream retailers. (Carlos Gonzalez/TNS) The ugly-sweater trend started with people buying vintage sweaters from thrift shops and surplus stores. Now mainstream retailers have spotted an opportunity, selling newly made ugly sweaters. Share story By John Ewoldt (Minneapolis) Star Tribune MINNEAPOLIS — Cole Magalis needed an ugly Christmas sweater for a party earlier this month, and it wasn’t easy to find one. He and his fiancée searched five stores to find a matching pair in their sizes. His determination paid off in a green sweater with a giant gingerbread man applique and candy-cane-striped sleeves. “I’m wearing the only one that would fit me,” the 29-year-old said. “We went to Herberger’s, Target, Wal-Mart and two Goodwills, and all were nearly sold out.

Maxx said if we could wait 90 minutes they were expecting a truck.” Ugly stats 26 percent of surveyed Americans own an ugly Christmas sweater or plan to buy one this year. 66 percent have no plans to get an ugly Christmas sweater. 55 percent of owners are women and 45 percent are men, and a large percentage are millennials.

(Ken Lambert / The Seattle Times) 24 ideas for the outdoors enthusiast A dozen digital delights Cool tech gifts for kids Wacky gifts for the tech-savvy person The best books of 2016 18 books for the bookworm in your life New paperback books to gift Gifts for millennials to give and get 5 CD box sets to wow baby-boom rock fans 7 gifts for the classical-music fan Easy recipes for delicious food gifts Gifts for gardeners When the ugly-sweater trend started, arguably about 15 years ago, hipsters were wearing over-the-top cardigans, mostly women’s, from the ’70s, ’80s and ’90s. Their popularity spread among thrift shops, surplus stores and vintage-apparel shops. Now mainstream retailers have spotted an opportunity, as what once seemed like a fad refuses to fade. Their sweaters are newly made, not from the depths of someone’s closet, but the festive holiday styling is the same. “This could be a perennial favorite for years and years to come,” said Mary Van Note of Ginger retail consulting in Minneapolis. “It has incredible widespread adoption from kids, teens and suburban moms.” The Minneapolis-based retailer Ragstock has been selling vintage holiday sweaters for a decade and saw double-digit sales increases through 2014. Business leveled out last year when consumers discovered brand-new designs at Target, Wal-Mart, Kohl’s, Herberger’s, Penney’s and T.J. Maxx, said Ragstock President Libby Finn. This year, Finn said, Ragstock for the first time discounted its collection from the launch Nov. 1 as sales migrate to big-box discounters and department stores. Wal-Mart has sold the ugly sweaters for three years, increasing its selection of holiday and novelty items by 40 percent this year. “Customers just can’t get enough of it, and the tackier the better,” said Deanah Baker, an apparel-buying executive at Wal-Mart. There are online options as well. UglyChristmasSweater.com went from $40,000 in sales in its first year, 2012, to more than $5 million last year. But even the ubiquitous sweaters and slightly more sedate vests for men have evolved. This year, merchants are selling sweatshirts in large sizes to market to men who didn’t want to buy or couldn’t fit into the vintage sweaters that are mostly in women’s sizes. “Happy Llamakah” and “Meowy Catmus” sweatshirts provide an alternative to sweaters festooned in beads, bells and balls. Department stores added cheeky onesies, pajamas, Santa suits, hoodies and men’s suits in gaudy holiday themes. For the early adopter looking to make an indelible Christmas memory, the Oppo “Rudolph” covers the wearer from neck to ankle in a bright blue and red polyester suit imprinted with reindeer and snowflakes. The kitschy Claus-wear is a cheap, convenient way to show holiday spirit. Most used sweaters cost less than $25 and even the new Oppo suits are less than $100. But more expensive sweaters have recently debuted from sources as varied as Whoopi Goldberg, Iron Maiden and the National Football League. NFLshop.com created an ugly sweater, at $70, for each of the 32 teams in the league. John Ewoldt Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

REACTIONARY17 days ago Walmart Won’t Sell ‘Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter’ Shirts After Police Protest © Edgard Garrido / Reuters Walmart has agreed to quit selling shirts that say “Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter” after the president of the national Fraternal Order of Police asked for the item to be dropped. The president, Chuck Canterbury, had also asked that the stores stop selling all other shirts carrying the words “Black Lives Matter,” but Walmart refused that request. Canterbury’s letter called the shirts “offensive.” He added, “I am concerned that allowing these articles to be sold in this way will damage your company’s good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law-enforcement officers.” He continued, “Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another.” In a statement, Walmart said Tuesday night that the stores offer millions of items from different parties, including those that say Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter, and All Lives Matter.

Police officers from four Upper Bucks municipalities participated. - (Photo / Melinda Rizzo) Upper Bucks County businesses teamed up with local law enforcement and other donors to ensure youngsters have a Merry Christmas. The sixth annual Shop with a Cop event Thursday at Wal-Mart in Richland Township hosted nearly 60 underprivileged elementary school students. Children were recommended by police officers and Quakertown Community School District guidance counselors. Event sponsor Joseph A. McGinley, whose law firm is in Doylestown, said helping goes beyond any business decision he can make. “On a personal level, there are kids who have a lot less than others do,” he said. A record $28,000 was donated so youngsters could shop for holiday gifts, said Robert Lee, event organizer and Quakertown police officer. About 25 officers from police departments in Dublin and Quakertown boroughs and Richland and Springfield townships participated. Robert Adams, president of Roselon Industries in Quakertown, is a longtime advocate for Quakertown and a Shop with a Cop sponsor. “Anything we can do to build up the downtown area is a good thing,” Adams said. “It’s important to be invested.” Children are matched with an officer/shopping buddy, receive a Wal-Mart gift card for $150 to shop and have their gifts wrapped and tagged by volunteers. The outpouring of financial support from area businesses has been overwhelming, Lee said. The Proper Brewing Co. sponsors the event because community involvement is part of its business model. “A business needs a healthy community to be successful,” said Kris Wilson, who owns and operates The Proper with Brian Wilson, her husband. “We aim for The Proper to be recognized as a true team player in building the Quakertown community.” Lee said contact with officers from local police departments, who volunteered their time, fostered positive perceptions of law enforcement. “I also think it’s important to let kids know that our police officers are here to help,” Wilson said.

And the aisles were full of holiday smiles as Christmas came early courtesy of a Super Bowl champion. “For these kids out here that might not have any Christmas at all, to be able to give them something to make them happy is what I’ve always wanted to do,” Broncos cornerback Chris Harris Jr. said. The Chris Harris Jr. Foundation hosted 50 underprivileged and at-risk youth as part of “Shop with a Jock.” Harris provided each child with dinner, courtesy of Jersey Mike’s, and $100 in gifts at Wal-Mart. “You get the interaction with them, you see the need, they really need it and they look forward to this so it’s really special,” Harris said. Fellow cornerbacks Bradley Roby and Lorenzo Doss were also there to spread the holiday cheer. Harris knows how much a night like this can impact these children because he was once in their shoes. “I never had any role models growing up, I never had anybody take me out (to shop) when my mom couldn’t afford for me to get presents for Christmas,” he said. “So I just always wanted to do this to make an impact out here.” Harris was named to his third consecutive Pro Bowl on Tuesday.

(Slidell police photo) Print Email Robert Rhoden, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune By Robert Rhoden, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune The Times-Picayune Email the author | Follow on Twitter on December 21, 2016 at 7:40 AM, updated December 21, 2016 at 11:01 AM comments Two people have been arrested on charges of stealing used vehicle batteries from a Slidell Wal-Mart store, and are suspected of committing similar crimes elsewhere in Louisiana and other states. Spencer Klimek and Amber Klimek, both 23 and described as recently married, confessed to the crimes, explaining that they sold the batteries for money to support their addiction to heroin and crack cocaine, Slidell police said Tuesday (Dec. 20). They were booked Dec. 14 with two counts of simple burglary. Spencer Klimek's address of record is in Huntsville, Ala., Amber Klimek's in Cookeville, Tenn. Amber Klimek is also known as Amber Carender, police said. The two are accused of breaking into a storage bin and stealing the batteries from the Wal-Mart at 39142 Natchez Drive in Slidell on Nov. 10 and 11. Detective Thomas McNulty investigated the incidents and identified the suspects, the vehicle they used and where the batteries were being sold for cash, police said. The old batteries have a component that can be recycled. McNulty, working with detective David Carrick of the St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Office, determined the suspects committed numerous similar crimes throughout Louisiana, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Tennessee, and Mississippi, mainly targeting Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores, police said. A Slidell police spokesman said charges might be filed against the couple elsewhere in Louisiana and other states. follow us Twitter Facebook LInkedIn Google+ Pinterest Tumblr special report The New Orleans Gun Pipeline An exploration of the complex, violent ecosystem that keeps New Orleans criminals armed.

All three warehouse clubs have different prices. Is joining worth it? Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Dec 21, 2016 at 8:20AM Even with the ability to buy things online at cheap prices, Americans still love warehouse clubs. The discount retailers charge an annual fee for membership for which consumers gain access to their stores. For what it costs to join Costco (NASDAQ:COST), Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT) Sam's Club, and BJ's, consumers get access to a no-frills, limited-choice shopping experience where prices are kept low. Generally words like "no-frills" and "limited-choice" are not selling points for shoppers, but the warehouse clubs have made what they don't have part of the experience. By sacrificing fancy displays, grocery bags at checkout, dealing with limited in-store personnel, and often having to buy in bulk quantities, consumers get lower prices (or at least in most cases they do.) Costco, Sam's, and BJ's may, for example, have a popular cereal, perhaps Lucky Charms or Cheerios, at a lower per-box price than a nearby supermarket. To get that price, however, shoppers may need to buy in extra-large quantities. The same applies to most food items, household supplies, and pharmacy items stocked by the three chains. You will save money on a per-serving, per-container, or per-dose basis by shopping at Costco, Sam's, or BJ's, but you will pay a price to get in the door, and there are a variety of reasons you may not actually save money shopping at a warehouse club. Warehouse clubs have no-frill checkouts where bags are not provided. Image source: author. What does it cost to join Costco, Sam's Club, and BJ's? All three chains charge an annual membership fee just to get in the door. Paying up gives you and your immediate family (you and a spouse or significant other living at the same address) access to whichever of the three you join as well as the ability to shop at their websites. The overall structure is the same for Costco, Sam's, and BJ's. Members pay once a year for 12 months of access, but the costs vary slightly. Costco: The company calls its basic membership "Gold Star" and people pay an annual fee of $55 to join. The company also sells a single-user business membership at that price (with additional cards costing $55 each) and an "Executive Gold Star" membership which costs $110, but offers 2% back on qualified purchases at the company's stores. Sam's Club: The basic Sam's Savings or Sam's Business cards cost $45 a year with the business getting cards for two people at that price (with additional cards costing $45 each). Sam's also offers the $100 a year "Sam's Plus" card which comes with cash back rewards, and other special offers much like Costco's Executive Gold Star offer. BJ's: This chain prices its basic memberships in between its two rivals. Its "Personal Membership," which includes a second card for family, costs $50, the same as its "Business Membership." The retailer also offers a "BJ's Perks Rewards" card for $100 that offers 2% cash back and other bonuses. Is joining Costco, Sam's Club, or BJ's worth it? In short, the answer is it can be, but it usually is not because people buy things they would not have otherwise purchased or they overbuy, leading to waste. The prices are cheaper than traditional stores, according to Michael Clayman, editor/writer at Warehouse Club Focus and www.warehouseclubfocus.com (account required) who spoke to The Motley Fool in an email interview. "Every year, we publish an item basket comparison between the three clubs, a Wal-Mart Supercenter, and a grocery store in the same market," he wrote. "The results have been consistent and show the dramatic savings a consumer receives by shopping at a club compared to the other two." The problem is that lower prices can mean that consumers save money, but that's not true when people buy more than they planned or more than they need. Billie Blair, an organizational psychologist who serves as CEO of Change Strategists, Inc., laid out how that happens to The Motley Fool in an email. "Taken as a whole and over a span of years, the answer is that warehouse clubs almost never save money for the individual shopper," she wrote. That, Blair added, is due to "membership fees, wastage from overbuying (produce and such), the necessity to buy in quantity (canned goods that sit on shelves and have to be discarded) etc." Warehouse clubs offer good prices, lots of perks, and it's possible to earn back the membership fee in saved money. Doing that takes the discipline to buy only what you need and only quantities you will actually use. That's possible, but difficult for many people.

(AP) — A group says some Virginia Wal-Mart stores are discriminating by using security packaging on black hair products. The Virginian-Pilot reports (http://bit.ly/2i0plbo) members of the Making Change at Walmart campaign held a news conference earlier this month, saying security boxes were being used on hair products for African-Americans at two Suffolk and Norfolk stores. The national campaign is run by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union. This week, the group launched a television ad, asking viewers to call Suffolk Mayor Linda Johnson and "tell her to demand Wal-Mart stop." Wal-Mart spokesman Phillip Keene said in a statement that the allegations are false and offensive. Keene said some products are more frequently targeted by shoplifters, thus the company takes "normal" measures to protect the items against theft. ___ Information from: The Virginian-Pilot, http://pilotonline.com Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

(Scott Olson/Getty Images) A 38-year-old man charged with killing a seasonal UPS driver in a Wal-Mart parking lot has been ordered to undergo a mental evaluation after telling a judge he believed he killed President-elect Donald Trump. Justin Barkley of Dryden appeared in Tompkins County Court on M (ITHACA POLICE DEPARTMENT) onday to be arraigned for the murder of 52-year-old William Schumacher, who was shot shortly before 1 a.m. on Dec. 8 outside a Wal-Mart in Ithaca. Defense lawyer James Baker says Barkley pleaded guilty to the indictment, but insisted he had shot and killed Trump, not Schumacher. Judge John Rowley declined to accept the plea and adjourned the indictment to Jan. 6, ordering an evaluation to determine if Baker is competent to stand trial. Prosecutors say Barkley didn’t know Schumacher. Officials haven’t disclosed a motive.

(REUTERS/Rebecca Cook)    4443001 Video footage taken from a Florida Wal-Mart shows a shopper literally jumping the gun. The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Don't Be Surprised If NVIDIA Closes Higher Today The Rex Tillerson Portfolio (Seeking Alpha) Related JPM Who Is Jay Clayton? 10 Companies Whose Insiders Purchased The Most Stock In 2016 The Rex Tillerson Portfolio (Seeking Alpha) During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump dissed about half of the United States’ major corporations, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) was not exempt from his rage – pretty much the opposite. Trump repeatedly promised to “drain the swamp,” making reference to eliminating Wall Street’s influence over domestic politics and policy. Once elected, he made a u-turn, appointing Goldman Sachs investment banker and managing partner Steve Bannon as the White House chief strategist and Steven Mnuchin as the Treasury secretary. Other former Goldman Sachs employees who will occupy key spots in Trump’s administration include Bob Rubin, Lawrence Summers, Hank Paulson and Anthony Scaramucci. Notwithstanding, Trump’s most notable move was the appointment of Goldman’s chief operations officer Gary Cohn as the director of the National Economic Council and an assistant to the president for economic policy. In a long editorial piece titled "The Vampire Squid Occupies Trump's White House," Rolling Stone’s Matt Taibbi delved into Cohn’s problematic appointment. “The new party line, emanating both from Washington and from Alt-Right yahoos on the Internet, is that people like Gary Cohn are no longer the swindling scum-lords Trump said they were a few months ago, but simply smart businessmen,” he wrote. A Close Look At Goldman's Not-So-Golden History In order for people not to get lost in rhetoric and remember how “evil” Goldman Sachs and its executives are, Taibbi went over the company’s recent history of controversy. Here are some of the main points: Goldman has “an extraordinary history of placing its executives in high-ranking governmental and quasi-governmental positions.” The bank has been mixed up in the trafficking of toxic mortgages, an extensive state corruption case in Malaysia, the manipulation of global commodity prices and “a heinous episode involving Greece in which the bank helped to mask the country's ballooning debt while simultaneously working with JPMorgan Chase [JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM)] to create an index for betting against Greece's economy.” Goldman Sachs was one of the main players responsible for the 2017 financial crisis. But, unlike Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers, the company survived the cataclysm. While the corporation argued that this was due to its smart and humble leadership, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations concluded that it had instead saved itself by passing on its terrible mortgage investments to its clients while simultaneously shorting them. Through numerous, questionable deals, the bank “went from having a $6 billion bet on mortgages to having a $10 billion bet against them” in just a few months — this is what they call the "big short." Notice, however, that the company has repeatedly denied having bet against its own clients. Analysts have argued that Goldman Sachs should have gone out of business around the financial crisis, like other big banks. Nonetheless, “two little-discussed acts of government welfare in September of 2008 helped save the company,” Taibbi explained. (1) The government granted the company an emergency Commercial Bank Holding Company status, even though it was never a commercial bank, allowing it to get funds from the Federal Reserve. (2) The Fed prohibited short-selling financial stocks, protecting Goldman from smart investors who sensed that something was wrong.

On a scale of one to sexy, that Coleman you dig out of the garage and lug to the beach every summer falls somewhere around a two — a little more exciting than a can opener, nowhere near as enticing as a Viking Range. But for the past 10 years, a company called YETI has been making coolers hot. These things aren’t your average Igloos — both are coolers, sure, but in the same sense that a Bugatti and a Barbie jeep you can buy at Walmart are both cars. YETIs are thick, plastic, grizzly bear-resistant, bulletproof chests that cost between $300 and $1200. They look like a Brinks truck if you were to shrink it down, take the wheels off, and strap some handles to it. YETIs keep whatever’s inside cold for days and days without a change of ice. And they’ve been going like cold beers at a tailgate. In 2015, YETI made close to $470 million in sales, over five times its 2014 numbers. The company filed for an IPO last July, seeking a valuation of $5 billion. There’s a good chance this weekend that you or someone you know will tear the wrapping paper off one of YETI’s many offerings. The company has branched out from coolers and now sells tumblers, thermoses, hats, shirts, stickers, and more. The products are popular because they’re exceptionally effective, but also because the brand has become a status symbol in certain circles. Originally attended by hunters and fishermen, the Church of YETI is now filled with people who wish they were hunters and fishermen, as well as college kids and folks who just like a good outdoor party. Devotees evangelize about YETI on social media, more recruits arrive, and the pews overflow. “There’s basically this cult around this product.” “We had all these dudes out there wouldn’t pony up $300 for a cooler, but they had spent over $300 on logo-ed merch,” Rick Wittenbraker said, who started Yeti’s marketing department in 2009 and worked there until 2013. “It happened all the time. That’s when you start really understanding that there’s a fervor there in the population, and it is a badge of honor, and people aspire to it. There’s basically this cult around this product.” Like any religion worth its salt, YETI has a fringe flourishing around its edges. The hashtag #yetibutts — as in, YETI coolers meets human bottoms — and social media accounts like @yetibuttsdaily and @yetibutts_official are populated with tens of thousands of user-submitted photos of women photographed from behind. Women wearing little to no clothing as they sit, bare-assed, on these indestructible chests. There’s often a confederate flag, a Trump sign, or a gun involved. A high-end cooler — the innocuous thing you use to keep your beer cold or your fish from rotting — has taken on a life of its own. Roy and Ryan Seiders, two brothers and avid outdoorsmen, founded YETI in 2006 because no cooler kept things cold as long as they wanted it to. Then they stumbled upon a cooler built in Thailand that they improved by teaming up with a factory in the Philippines. The deep need in the market became apparent when YETIs started flying off the shelves of the specialty hunting and fishing stores that stocked them in the States. And the coolers were selling themselves through word of mouth. The Seiders weren’t doing a damn thing to market them. “It was almost like they were making an effort not to talk about their product,” Wittenbraker said by phone from his home in Austin. “Talk about low-hanging fruit — they didn’t even have social accounts. And I knew from my friends who owned the product that all they wanted to do was talk about this.” Wittenbraker met the Seiders through friends at a fly fishing film festival in Austin, and came up with a list of things the brothers could do to boost their products’ visibility. But the company didn’t have the manpower or the knowledge to implement his ideas, and there was basically no market competition. YETI had done $3 million in sales that year, even though the whole business shared one Gmail account and employed just eight people, including the guys working in the warehouse. Roy Seider thought Facebook was a thing teenaged girls used to talk to each other. Ambassador @KenHoeve and his Flip flotilla taking some sunset swings. #BuiltForTheWild - Hopper Flip 12 A photo posted by YETI Coolers (@yeti) on Sep 16, 2016 at 11:40am PDT Wittenbraker convinced the brothers that social media was necessary, and that he was the guy to get it going. He set about putting a marketing framework into place, targeting mostly white guys in the South, pockets of Middle America, and the Northeast, all areas where people loved to hunt and fish. The brand soon became a signifier of a rugged, cool lifestyle, and people started wearing YETI hats and T-shirts because they wanted to broadcast that they were the kind of person who did the things that made one of these fancy coolers necessary. Or at least pretend that they were. “You start piling all these things together, and you realize there’s this tribe,” Wittenbraker said. “It’s kind of aspirational. You’d have blue collar dudes making 24 grand a year, and they own a $400 cooler. Because that was symbolic to them. It was iconic to them to say, ‘Yeah, I’m there, I got the best.’ “And for wealthy people in New England, this is the best in class. The guys with the houses on Nantucket or Martha’s Vineyard or Kennebunkport, do they need a cooler that’s grizzly bear-proof and holds ice for eight days? No, not at all. But it’s that standard and it’s that quality.” “For a lot of southern schools it’s like, ‘I gotta have my Chubbies, my Southern Tide polo, my Costas with blue-mirrored lenses on a Croakies strap, and the big swoop-doo bangs.’ That’s the guy.” Wittenbraker’s plan worked, and the brand took off online. YETI currently has more than 600,000 followers on Facebook and Instagram, where it posts wholesome, back-to-the-earth type photos of people fishing, hunting, and drinking coffee or bourbon by a campfire (as well as dead animals — PETA, avert your eyes). Wittenbraker was right: All people who are obsessed want to do is talk about the object of their ardor. (I had an Uber driver overhear me talk about this article on the phone while I was in his car, and as I was getting out, he stopped me to tell me what make and model he had and how much he loved it.) “No question that social media has been a massive driving force for YETI,” YETI’s current vice president of marketing Corey Maynard said. “The power of peer referral and celebration of these communities have been foundations of our brand.” In 2012, the private equity firm Cortec bought a roughly two-thirds stake in the company for around $67 million because the Seiders couldn’t keep up with demand. Wittenbraker described the company as a brand that takes people’s passions — hunting, fishing, partying — and puts them “on steroids.” At this point, devotees are basically shooting themselves up with YETI. Hell, they’re mainlining the brand. I’ve talked to dozens of people who love YETIs, from hardcore fishermen in Maine and North Carolina, to mountain bikers in Colorado, to teachers in Texas, to finance guys in Manhattan. They spoke about how well the coolers work, but they also like what the brand represents: a rugged, outdoor lifestyle. And many of these buyers are aware that they’re drinking the Kool-Aid. Matthew Wells, a senior associate at a construction management firm in Boston, likened it to Patagonia. “You don’t really need the performance that the gear provides, but you’re into the fact that you have it,” Wells said. “And you probably wish you did more of the stuff that requires it.” YETI has tapped into another market, too: College kids and people who love to tailgate. Campuses became fertile territory for converting people to YETI worship. The company quickly found traction at Big 12 and SEC schools located in states where the coolers were already selling out. Branching out into other products like tumblers and thermoses — products that now account for 62% of the company’s sales — helped reach a less hardcore demographic. “I am a sucker for the brand,” said Chris Ravn, a banker in New York City who wrote to me via a Facebook message. “Not only does it keep my fish and beer cold, but I also still like to think I'm a frat boy!” When Wittenbraker was with the company, the products sold best in the South. Buyers were overwhelmingly male by a ratio of five or six to one. Maynard wouldn’t disclose where YETI sells best these days or who’s buying, claiming that the company has “grown substantially more balanced in terms of gender and geographic diversity over our 10-year history.” Wittenbraker thinks it’s only natural, given demographics, that the coolers would find their way to tailgates. If you’re using a cooler to hunt and fish and it works well, why would you go back to an inferior version while you’re watching football? YETI wised up quickly and began making coolers with the logos of SEC and Big 12 schools on them, though Maynard denies putting much marketing weight behind this. Yeti stack #ImJuiced #yetibutts #cooler #party #poolparty #summer16 #college #university #fraternity #sorority #letsgo #beauty #hammered #beers #drunk #dive #juicednationPosted by I'm JUICED on Tuesday, September 6, 2016 “We have very sparingly marketed overtly to tailgating or college students,” Maynard said. “Choosing instead to focus our communications on aspirational outdoor activities such as hunting, fishing, surfing, ranching, rodeo, professional BBQ, and other kinds of outdoor adventuring.” Nevertheless, YETI is now firmly rooted in the culture of southern schools, and has expanded into everyday fraternity life. “There’s this uniform and validation and level of social accreditation,” Wittenbraker said. “For a lot of southern schools it’s like, ‘I gotta have my Chubbies, my Southern Tide polo, my Costas with blue-mirrored lenses on a Croakies strap, and the big swoop-doo bangs.’ That’s the guy. And every college has, like, six billion of those dudes. They’re the same guys, not all of ‘em, but a lot of ‘em, who buy the coolers.” * * * I first heard about #yetibutts this summer when I was talking to someone who mentioned that he and his buds from college thought the hashtag was funny. I asked him what #yetibutts was, and he told me to just look it up on Instagram. So I did. And found myself scrolling through thousands of pictures of women’s bare butts. Not all of the coolers in these photos have college decals on them. But many do. And most of the owners of the butts — which are overwhelmingly white — appear to be college-aged. They’re also faceless, because the pictures are taken from behind. There are levels to #yetibutts. Some photos just feature women on coolers wearing bikinis. Sometimes they’re wearing thongs. Sometimes they aren’t wearing anything. But many pictures also involve Trump stickers, or flags with the president-elect’s name on them wrapped around these half-naked women (there’s a big overlap between #yetibutts and #babesfortrump). There are also a lot of guns. A woman might be holding one, or maybe a hunting rifle leans up against the cooler as she poses with a beer in one hand and dangles a bra off the finger of another. “Not only does it keep my fish and beer cold, but I also still like to think I'm a frat boy!” And then you start to notice that many of these photos feature Confederate flags, an undeniably racist symbol. It could be the print of a bikini, a sticker on the cooler’s plastic siding, or an actual flag draped over a woman’s shoulders or held above her head. If you weren’t troubled already, maybe the Confederate flag will do it for you. Or maybe you don’t see anything wrong with any of this at all. In August, The Daily Caller, a conservative website, posted about #yetibutts, calling it The Biggest Trend Sweeping Across College Campuses. Maxim then picked the story up and gave the post this kicker: “If Yeti Butting were a major, all these girls all deserve to graduate Cum Laude.” Currently there are 97,674 posts tagged with #yeticoolers on Instagram and 11,153 posts tagged with #yetibutts (there’s a #yetiboobs hashtag, too, but it’s misleading, because the pictures mostly still just feature butts). That’s so many butts! I can’t find the first picture ever posted, but the movement seems to have taken off in 2016: The account @Yetibuttsofficial has gained 11.9k followers since the first post on June 21 of this year, and @yetibuttsdaily has amassed 26.6k since Feb. 22. YETI disavows #yetibutts. “We had nothing to do with the hashtag and do not support or condone the instances where it has been used in connection with offensive material,” Maynard said. YETI doesn’t seem to be actively trying to shut any of these accounts down. I reached out to the company to see if they’ve sent any cease and desist letters, but didn’t hear back by the time of publication. The company has, in the past, gone after people who are selling goods with the YETI trademark but are not officially affiliated with the brand. The #yetibutts accounts don’t appear to be monetized. When I asked @yetibuttgirls via an Instagram message if they made any money off the account, I got this response: “No I don’t. The guys and I have thought about selling clothes and hats and stickers but we’d have to change the name. Consider we would get in a lot of trouble with YETI for using there [sic] name.” When I asked where they lived and what their name was, the owner of the account didn’t respond. #merryxmas #merrychristmas #yetibutts #yetibuttsdaily #yeticoolers #yetibutt A photo posted by Yeti Butts (@yetibuttsdaily) on Dec 5, 2016 at 8:43pm PST Wittenbraker says he first noticed the #yetibutts trend when the brand started holding contests for user-generated content on Facebook. They’d see these kinds of photos come in on their page, and they deleted the ones they had control over. Maynard was clear that there is no official relationship between this organic guerrilla marketing movement and the company itself. YETI prefers to push the rugged outdoor lifestyle rather than one based on naked women and confederate flags. But figuring out how the latter attached itself to a cooler — a cooler! — isn’t rocket science. “I think part of that really comes down to, well, here’s this item,” Wittenbraker said. “By itself, it’s pretty benign and has this standalone purpose. But it gets pulled into these other arenas because of its impact on these activities that people go crazy about. So when you really look at it as temporary housing for beer, and that everywhere beer goes, the cooler goes ...” He paused. “... then it doesn’t take long to understand how it sort of got there.” YETI coolers have morphed from an efficient piece of sporting equipment into a container for multiple American forms of worship, from enjoying nature, to tailgating, to flying the Confederate flag. But as long as you’ve got people coming into your sanctuary and tossing bills in the collection plate, do you really care what made them walk through the door?

COMMENT Santa’s supply chain is actually a possibility, as we discover in this piece Ben Lobel Santa Claus’ supply chain is objectively impressive. According to the lore surrounding this mysterious businessman, he delivers one present to every child in the world — that’s 1.93 billion children — in one evening. It sounds like an impossible task for an impossible man. However, the real takeaway for small businesses — and the real Christmas miracle — is that Santa’s supply chain is actually a possibility. 1. It’s all just a matter of mathematics Firstly, that figure of 1.93 billion needs readdressing. It’s well established that children who don’t believe in Santa and those on the naughty list don’t make the cut. A reasonable guess, therefore, would be that Santa delivers to, say, 1.5 billion children on Christmas Eve. This means his elves need to make 1.5 billion presents every year. This is perfectly doable. Assuming that the average elf works just a little bit harder than the average German at 1,500 hours a year, and if we assume that an elf can make one present every two hours on average, then Santa would need two million employees to make his supply chain a reality. Two million employees, as it turns out, is a perfectly realistic number as well. Walmart, the biggest private employer in the world, has more than two million workers. Surely, anything Walmart can do, Santa can do better, right? 2. Secrets can be valuable Santa’s business model should be the envy of any aspiring entrepreneur. His brand is instantly recognisable, his organisation is global in a wildly ambitious way, and he has absolutely no competition. Yet, part of the reason why so much of the mathematics surrounding Santa’s supply chain is guesswork and analogy is that Santa keeps his cards close to his chest. This, in turn, would explain why Santa remains the father of Christmas… Father Christmas, if you will. Trade secrets can market your business as unique against a backdrop of samey competition by creating a secretive aura around what you do. Coca-Cola, for example, has marketed their fizzy drink on a ‘secret recipe’ for years. Santa’s supply chain does the same thing. With his enigmatic approach to his organisation, Santa remains a lovable and reputable brand after hundreds of years. 3. Let other people market for you Marketing isn’t so much a science as it is an art. There are few cases of one-size-fits-all and, even when you think you’ve found one, there’s always one business that does things differently. One definite rule that all businesses should follow is to have an active Facebook and Twitter account. After all, you can’t expect to go very far without interacting with your followers on Twitter and Facebook. Except that Apple, the largest tech company in the world and the eighth largest company in the world overall, has both a Facebook and Twitter account on which it has posted absolutely nothing. Ever. Do you know who else hasn’t ever posted anything on Facebook or Twitter? Santa Claus. Yet despite this, or maybe even because of it, Santa’s supply chain and his brand remain synonymous with Christmas and good feelings. The moral for small businesses isn’t that they need to avoid social media (remember, one size doesn’t fit all when it comes to marketing). Rather, small businesses need to recognise that letting their customers market their business for them can be a more powerful tactic than doing it yourself. Santa’s brand and the story of his supply chain tap into the emotions of his customers. As a result, people wind up posting on Twitter and Facebook about Santa every time December rolls around. All of this is free advertising for the man in red. Still, the odd verified Tweet here and there wouldn’t exactly hurt his brand either. It would certainly help to silence all those ‘Santa Claus isn’t real!’ types… 4. Be consistent and safe Of course, noone’s going to be marketing your brand every year, for free, on the basis that you’re a kind, lovable and amazing person, if you’re not a kind, lovable and amazing person. Still, small businesses need not aim for Santa levels of merriness. Instead, small businesses should remember that customers value brands they can trust — and who’s more trustworthy than Ol’ Saint Nick? Santa’s appeal is vested in the fact that people know exactly what to expect from his business. He’s a philanthropic present giver who visits once a year, dressed in red and with his nine magical reindeer in tow. Santa’s brand is consistent, it’s reliable and it lives up to its name. This is a lesson that businesses should learn. A practical and actionable way that businesses can achieve consistency is through safety. Nothing is more consistent than a safe supply chain and you can bet that Santa likely employs a few thousand extra elves to deliver regular equipment inspections and sleigh inspections. Then there’s Santa’s warehouse. Storing 1.5 billion toys is no mean feat. Each toy is going to be individual and each toy needs to be stored so that his elves know exactly which gift is going to which child. A warehouse like that would require a herculean amount of bureaucracy to keep things orderly. A huge part of that is safety. In the UK, Canada and Australia, the government recommendations on warehouse racking inspection frequency differ somewhat. However, a good general rule to take from these three countries is that warehouse racking inspections should happen at least once a year from an outside expert. All countries also recommend more regular rack safety inspections from staff. Getting elves to inspect racking on a regular basis isn’t going to be an issue (these guys are meticulous and magical), but getting an outside expert in might be problematic. Santa wants to keep his supply chain a secret, so bringing in just anybody is a definite no. Still, I hear that the Easter Bunny is free most of the year. Whether or not he’s qualified to inspect racking is another issue altogether, though. For small businesses, safety should also be a big part of what keeps your business model consistent and reliable. If racking collapses in Santa’s warehouse, there go 1,000 presents (about 15 month’s work for one elf). Besides that, there’s the danger of elves being caught in the collapse as well. Your business might not be as Christmassy, but the financial and human costs of an unsafe workplace are the same. It’s why OSHA calculates that businesses can save four to six dollars for every one dollar they invest in safety. 5. Don’t be a Scrooge The most important lesson for small businesses to learn from Santa is to be generous at Christmas time. Not only do customers expect it — in terms of deals and offers — but it’s a great way to sell more stuff at the busiest time of the year. More than that, not being a Scrooge just means being nice. Treat your employees well at Christmas and they’ll likely stay on until next Christmas. It’s not just Santa who recognises the value of being nice to his staff. Richard Branson has often spoken at length about the value of being kind to your employees. Wait a second. Richard Branson is an older man with white hair and a white beard, he runs a huge global operation, his business’ favourite colour is red, and he owns a fleet of planes capable of delivering things all over the world… Coincidence?

STARTUP Mercari Sees Room For Disruption In E-Commerce Japanese unicorn and marketplace platform Mercari is making a huge global play and taking market share from the likes of Amazon and eBay. By Alex Moazed Alex Moazed is the CEO of Applico, which he founded with credit cards in college. He advises companies like Google and those in Highland Capital's portfolio on platform innovation and has developed more than 300 apps. @AlexMoazed Founder and CEO, Applico@AlexMoazed WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement One would think the e-commerce battle has been settled, with Amazon firmly at the top and Walmart's recent acquisition, Jet.com, in second place. In complete spite of this, Japanese startup Mercari is setting out to carve its own niche in the field and doing quite well in its charge forward. After raising $75 million in March, the marketplace platform's valuation pushed above $1 billion, making Mercari officially a unicorn, and Japan's first one in years. It's completely dominated the e-commerce market in Japan since its founding in February 2013, connecting everyday people looking to buy and sell everyday items. Now, with its sights firmly set on becoming a serious global player, Mercari has been heavily investing in expanding its platform to the US. Leading that effort is Ryo Ishizuka, the CEO of Mercari's American business unit. Ishizuka is a seasoned entrepreneur, having founded and led RockYou, one of the first companies to start building games for social networks like Facebook and MySpace. The RockYou team expanded to Asia and became a dominant player in those markets, which caught the eye of Ishizuka's partner in Mercari, CEO Shintaro Yamada. The founding Mercari team came together in Japan in mid-2013 and knew they had a massive uphill battle ahead of them, taking on the likes of eBay, Amazon, and any other dynamic e-commerce startups that were in the mix then or would pop up later. From the outset, Mercari was meant to be a global company. Its core team all had previously founded and led successful startups of their own, but they didn't grow significantly outside of their respective domestic markets. Thus, their thirsts for success had not been slaked. Considering the opportunity for disrupting the Japanese e-commerce market and their distinct familiarities with Japan made it the perfect place to get their footing. Explosive growth fueled Mercari's takeover in Japan and, less than a year after their founding, it was already expanding to the US. "We really saw the US as a gateway to the rest of the world, to becoming a global company," said Ishizuka. Since that expansion, Mercari has seen over 20 million downloads in the US and plans to double its American team over the next year. Selling Something Different When the company started, Mercari's founders believed that e-commerce was still an open and competitive field. Their path to success, however, would require them to build and offer a unique value proposition. A distinguishing feature of Mercari's approach is that they built their business mobile-first, designing the app and launching that first, which is likely a product of their timing when compared to Amazon, Craigslist, and eBay. The most important piece to their strategy was making the whole easy and seamless. Rather than a mixed fee approach for sellers like eBay uses, the platform simply charges sellers ten percent for the transaction. When the sale is made, sellers are offered a quick shipping option via Mercari. The average transaction in Mercari's marketplace is between twenty and thirty dollars. With the platforms taking only ten percent ($2 or $3 each time), this figure reveals the sheer volume of transactions taking place on the platform considering the platform pulls $12.2 billion JPY ($107 million USD) in annual revenue. Even the onboarding process for sellers is made to be simple. By comparison, eBay sellers must hurdle seven or eight steps, but Mercari only requires five. As well, the delay for listings appearing on the platform is mere minutes, while eBay frequently has hours-long delays before the listing is public. Having An Impact Mercari's approach is also having some noteworthy and positive side effects. When targeting the initial market, Ishizuka and team realized that people were becoming less fixated on buying new brand items every time they wanted something. In fact, they found this trend occurring worldwide. A bulk of Mercari users are buying and selling used items, which Ishizuka finds to be much more economical and friendlier to the environment. "We found the market was a lot more resource-conscious and we wanted to build for that," said Ishizuka. "Our platform enables a lot of people to clean up the house and make some money while they do it." The most active demographic in the marketplace is women in their 20s and 30s, in both Japan and the US. Both user bases are significantly comprised of stay-at-home mothers and housewives and Ishizuka sees Mercari as a tool for them to gain more purchasing power and financial independence. Mercari's Future As has been stated previously, Mercari has a hard focus on becoming a global marketplace. Right now, buyers and sellers can only interact with each other within their respective countries, but Ishizuka wants to see the markets all connect and allow smooth transactions across borders. The biggest startup competitors include the likes of OfferUp and LetGo, yet Mercari isn't worried about them. "OfferUp focuses on neighborhoods, while Mercari started operating nationally. Starting at that level gives our buyers and sellers much more choice than they would on OfferUp," said Ishizuka. "This increase in choice improves the chances of transactions taking place." In Japan, the Mercari platform was relatively free of fake listings and counterfeit items, but that was not the case in the US. The team vastly underestimated the amount of management the American market would require. Their small operations division grew tremendously (alongside an algorithm) to handle not only the problem of verifying listings, but also handling the spike in returns the platform was getting. Most Japanese users tend not to request to do a return of items purchased. Instead, they typically give the undesirable item away or resell it, while Americans have a culture of getting their money back for a returned item. Thankfully, the platform self-polices via the rating system and organically weeds out bad actors, which is a big supplement to the company's direct efforts, according to Ishizuka. To remedy any fraudulent transactions that get through the safeguards, Mercari refunds the transaction to the buyer. After a couple years operating in the US, Mercari has found incredible success given the crowded market for e-commerce. The startup has already opened a new office in London and plans to launch the app early next year, taking the step in their quest to achieve a global presence.

Webster, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune The Times-Picayune Email the author | Follow on Twitter on December 21, 2016 at 11:52 AM comments A man accused of attempting to steal a television from Walmart, then trying to get away in a stolen truck with the owner sleeping inside, was arrested Wednesday (Dec. 21). The U.S. Marshal's Gulf Coast Regional Task Force and the Kenner Police Department arrested Clyde Reed, 35, on an outstanding warrant that charged him with carjacking, simple kidnapping, negligent injuring, simple battery, reckless operation of a motor vehicle, hit and run driving, and theft of goods. Reed is accused of trying to steal a television from Walmart, 8912 Veterans Boulevard, by placing the appliance in a shopping cart then pushing the cart out the front doors without paying, police said. When store employees tried to stop him, police said Reed abandoned the television, ran into the parking lot, and got into a 2014 Ford F-150 pickup truck that was parked with the engine running. Reed wasn't aware that the owner of the truck was sleeping in the backseat. The 28-year-old owner woke up when Reed got in the truck and gunned the engine, police said. As the two men fought, Reed lost control of the truck and crashed into a 1986 GMC SUV that was being driven in the parking lot, police said. Reed then fled on foot. The driver of the SUV was taken to a local hospital and treated for lacerations to his head. follow us Twitter Facebook LInkedIn Google+ Pinterest Tumblr special report The New Orleans Gun Pipeline An exploration of the complex, violent ecosystem that keeps New Orleans criminals armed.

But many retailers are offering other ways to get gifts at the last minute, whether it’s staying open through the wee hours of the night like Toys R Us, or offering Christmas Eve store pickup like Wal-Mart. RELATED CONTENT: Scroll through The Blade’s Gift Guides for holiday ideas Here are some options for those still scrambling to buy presents: MIDNIGHT RUNS Many stores are extending their hours in the days leading up to Christmas. Toys R Us will stay open from 6 a.m. on Dec. 23 straight to 9 p.m. on Christmas Eve, while department store Kohl’s are staying open now until Christmas Eve. Certain Macy’s department stores will be open all night between Dec. 22 and Dec. 23. Sears will close at midnight through Dec. 23 and close at 6 p.m. on Christmas Eve. And Target will be open from 7 a.m. to midnight through Dec. 23 and stay open until at least 10 p.m. on Christmas Eve. SHOP THE UNEXPECTED If you can’t make it to the mall, a quick stop at a drug or specialty store might work. CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid are increasingly stocking their shelves with more toys for the little ones. And those three drugstores also have a big selection of plastic gift cards for use at other stores, such as video game retailer GameStop or bookseller Barnes & Noble. Meanwhile, office supplies store Staples sells flying drones and adult coloring books. And Dick’s Sporting Goods has Apple Watches, headphones and GoPro cameras. STORE PICKUP If you want to avoid searching for items in the store, you’re in luck. Many retailers let you buy items online and pick them up at a store the same day. After ordering and paying online, walk to a special section of the store with the confirmation email and ID and that’s it. Macy’s, Target and Best Buy are just some of the stores that offer store pickup. Wal-Mart says customers who order items before 6 p.m. on Dec. 23 can pick them up on Christmas Eve and even launched a website with the items that qualify at walmart.com/lastminutegifts. And at Sears.com, those who opt for store pickup between now and Christmas Eve can get 20 percent off clothing, jewelry and home goods if they type in a special promo code. SEND AN E-GIFT The websites of some major stores are offering a way to give an instant gift, called an e-gift. It’s similar to a gift card, but is supposed to be a little more personal: You choose the item you want to buy — say sneakers or a sweater — click the “E-Gift” or “GiftNow” button, pay, and then the recipient gets an email telling them you bought them a gift. The gift receiver accepts it and can make adjustments, such as changing the color or size, before it ships. Or they can just get something else entirely from the store. The service carries no extra charges to the gift giver or receiver, and is available on several websites, including Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom and Ralph Lauren. SAME-DAY DELIVERY It will cost you more, but if you’re desperate, you can get some items delivered the same day you order them online. Macy’s offers same-day delivery in some cities and so does Nordstrom. But be aware, some may not deliver on Christmas Eve, like Nordstrom. If you’re an Amazon.com Prime member paying the annual fee, the online retailer is lets shoppers in Miami, New York and other cities order toys, electronics and other gifts as late as 9:45 p.m. on Christmas Eve for delivery in two hours, meaning you’ll get it before midnight. OR JUST WAIT Procrastination may work in your favor if you end up not seeing a person you’re shopping for until after Christmas. That’s when after-holiday sales kick in, says Sara Skirboll, a shopping and trends expert at shopping deal app RetailMeNot. If the timing works, you’ll likely pay less for a gift than you would if you had bought it before the holidays, says Skirboll.

Mader EMAIL Tweet Comments 0 In 1988 Agugliaro got his license by the time he was 22 and opened his own shop with partner Rob Zadotti in 1994 In 2004, they were billing less than $1 million By 2006, they had turned the company around and started adding on services Mike Agugliaro and partner Rob Zadotti. Advertisement Advertisement We’ve written before in CONTRACTOR about contractors who became rich in their minds before they became rich in their bank accounts — speaker and author Weldon Long, Kenny Chapman of Blue Collar Success Group, consultant Ed O’Connell, former owner of O’Connell Plumbing. Popular Now IAPMO makes new Tentative Interim Amendment (TIA) available for public comment Plumbing and Heating Nightmares How many zone valves can be put on a transformer? “Their mindset holds them back,” Mike Agugliaro says of the many contractors he’s spoken with and trained. “They only know what they know.” Agugliaro was like many contractors — overworked, underpaid and ready to chuck it all. And then he had dual epiphanies. The things that he did and what he has accomplished since those two revelations a dozen years ago are why Mike Agugliaro, Gold Medal Service, East Brunswick, New Jersey, is our Contractor of the Year. View a gallery of images from Mike Agugliaro's career. Agugliaro is an electrician by training. He entered East Brunswick Vocational in 1984, started working full time for an electrical contractor in 1988, got his license by the time he was 22 and opened his own shop with partner Rob Zadotti in 1994. Being good tradesmen and being good contractors were different things. The focus for Gold Medal Services for 2017 is ‘sharpening the axe.’ “Our first 10 years in the business we worked a million hours,” Agugliaro says. “We had work, but we didn’t know what we were doing. It was seven days a week. It took a toll on us mentally, on our relationships and on everything else.” In 2004, Agugliaro had his wake-up calls. His son was about to be born and he realized, “ … this will be crazy. I’m never home. I’m going to miss all of his games and all the little things he’ll do in life. Holy crap, something’s got to give or I’ll be an absentee dad. And then Rob Zadotti walked into the shop and said, “I can’t take it no more. I’m done. I’m out of this.” Which made Agugliaro announce that he was quitting too. When Zadotti objected, they started talking. There had to be a better way and they intended to find out what it was. So did they join a trade association or look for a franchise? Nope. 1-800-Got-Junk and Zappos He looked at another company building a large service operation, 1-800-Got-Junk. He looked at Zappos. One of their suppliers believed in them so much that it paid for Agugliaro and Zadotti to spend a week at the Disney Institute. He learned from Dan S. Kennedy, author of 13 business books on sales, marketing and management, and from Joe Polish, the founder and president of Piranha Marketing Inc. and the creator of the Genius Network. They learned how other companies deliver world-class service. They learned how best-in-class companies handled operations, company culture, and marketing, and started applying the lessons one by one. In 2004, they were billing less than $1 million. By 2006, they had turned the company around and started adding on services. Were their models other successful contractors? Nope. Agugliaro looked at Target and Wal-Mart. “The idea was to be a one-stop shop that could serve you for anything you needed in your home,” Agugliaro says. “We started to see what other companies were doing like Target or Wal-Mart and we were seeing at least 10 years ago that convenience is the most important thing on the planet. Customers don’t have the time and can’t wait for multiple companies to come out to service them.” ‘The idea was to be a one-stop shop that could serve you for anything you needed in your home.’ Gold Medal Service today performs plumbing, heating and cooling, waterproofing, one-day bathroom solutions, indoor air quality, water filtration, standby generators and electrical service. Gold Medal Service has a 15,000-sq.ft. building and it recently purchased another 10,000-sq.ft. building. It will run service out of one and the installation department out of the other. Unlike some franchise operations, Agugliaro believes the different lines of business should be run under the single brand name of Gold Medal Service. The operations occupy separate line items in his budget and have their own supervision, but they are not separate departments or divisions. Agugliaro notes that the firm doesn’t need separate call centers, dispatching or trucks. They also employ what he calls “super techs” that can service multiple trades. Multiple skills sets “A lot of guys come in with one core skill set and our first task is to enhance that skill set to make them the best at what they know,” Agugliaro says. “And then, next we ask them what’s the service that intrigues them? It’s common for an air conditioning guy to want to learn electrical or for a heating and cooling service technician to want to do plumbing.” Technicians do ride-alongs with other trades to get hands-on experience. Gold Medal Service conducts training in their facility in its warehouse, using both in-house trainers and factory reps. The firm previously had a dedicated training room, but the equipment inside became outdated so quickly that they scrapped it. In 2016 Gold Medal Service grew from 150 employees to more than 190 employees, increasing its customer base from 100,000 to more than 125,000 customers. The firm increased its annual revenues to more than $28 million, compared with $24 million in 2015. Agugliaro was featured in August 2016 on CNBC’s Nightly Business Report discussing his story and the more than 90 national and international business leaders he has coached over the last four years to help grow their companies. He has spoken at various trade events, including Penton’s Comfortech Conference and Show. He has hosted multiple CEOWarrior events, including Fast Track and Warrior Circle events, and he hosts monthly CEOWarrior podcasts, which consistently get more than 2,000 downloads each. Gold Medal Service has become self-sustaining in a way that allows Agugliaro to spend most of his time teaching other contractors. Most contractors were taught the business by some other guy who didn’t know anything about running a business, he says. They have no formal training in sales or marketing or management. They think that they aren’t successful because they’re too young. They think that they aren’t successful because they’re too old. They’re afraid. They’ve been punched in the face by a bad economy and bad hires.  Why am I here? “We got to the point where the service company had run by itself for two or three years,” Agugliaro recounts. “My partner and I don’t even have an office in the building. So I began to ask myself ‘why am I here’ and it hit me that now I’m in a position to help people and change lives and to make that impact on business owners. It’s better to tell a hurtful truth than a comforting lie. You need to change, to grow, to think different. One of the things that will serve the people who read this is that there’s something they’re already great at, and the goal is for them to figure out what they are not great at and read a book or find a program and learn about whatever they’re bad at and improve themselves.” The warrior part of CEOWarrior comes from martial arts, which Agugliaro has studied since he was 15. He’s 46 now. ‘Focus is understanding the outcome you want to attain and staying on your path with your plan without getting distracted.’ “Martial arts taught me focus, discipline, endurance, and training over and over again,” he says. “It formed me into a strong person. I learned that there’s always another level to strive for; there are higher levels of mastery. One worse [problem for contractors] than fear, the worst disease is lack of focus. If they have focus and discipline, they would achieve anything they want. The situation is worse than ever today. Everybody’s on his phone. The constant distractions are endless today. So you have to have discipline to stay focused. Focus is understanding the outcome you want to attain and staying on your path with your plan without getting distracted.” Contractors need to learn marketing, sales and leadership, he says. There’s no business without marketing. There will be no money without a high-integrity sales process. There will be no wealth unless the contractor is an amazing leader. “Work on becoming better you,” Agugliaro advises. What Gold Medal Service is focusing on for 2017, says Agugliaro, is profitability. It’s “sharpening the axe” and taking its service to the next level of convenience to the customer to strengthen the brand. The team is working now to streamline and improve every single function, delivery of services, training and management. Four core values Gold Medal Service has four core values, he says. Number one is safety first for the contractor’s family and the customer’s. This is an industry in which we work on things that can kill you, like carbon monoxide and electricity. Core value number two is to deliver “Wow Service,” the highest level of customer service experience on the planet. Give the customer the quality of Nordstrom’s, but the emotional experience of Disney. Core value number three is integrity. And number four the company must be a great place to work — all for one and one for all. Don’t ever give up, Agugliaro says, no matter where you are in your business, no matter how old you are. A lot of people at 60 think that they’ll live to be 85 and then be dead. But what if you live to be 100? Better start working now.

(REUTERS/Rebecca Cook)    4443001 Video footage taken from a Florida Wal-Mart shows a shopper literally jumping the gun. The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Powdersville Walmart Supercenter and FOX Carolina's Surprise Squad teamed up to surprise a family for Christmas--but we had no idea how special the surprise would be. The idea was to help spread some holiday cheer by giving a random stranger a gift card worth $500 for Christmas shopping. FOX Carolina's Joe Gagnon pretended to be a Walmart employee to pick the lucky person. Little did he know, the woman he chose had recently suffered a major loss. "My husband passed away eight months ago," Regina Cameron said, "I haven't had time, this is all last-minute Christmas shopping." Walmart gave $596 to Cameron so she could buy all the things she planned to give her loved ones. She got the Christmas miracle she needed.  Copyright 2016 FOX Carolina (Meredith Corporation).

The spot opens with the fairly obvious insight that while Christmas is an unending source of joy for children everywhere, for adults it’s mostly a major source of stress and anxiety. A handful of such adults are interviewed, who talk about how stressful the holidays are now before fondly recalling childhood memories. Then Jones arrives on the scene and supposedly hypnotizes them into reliving their favorite Christmas moments while a film crew captures the results. When the footage is played back, the participants laugh and cry at footage of them happily looking out at falling snow, ripping open presents, tearing into a drum kit, riding a bike around the living room and otherwise acting like kids again. The spot concludes with the message, “Everyone should feel like a kid at Christmas,” and “Share a happy, healthy holiday.” While that may be a nice sentiment, it’s a far reach to connect it to the brand. It remains to be seen if Jones is an accomplished enough hypnotist to convince the participants that shopping at Walmart is anything other than a stressful clustercuss. But hey, maybe that is the connection.

(REUTERS/Rebecca Cook)    4443001 Video footage taken from a Florida Wal-Mart shows a shopper literally jumping the gun. The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

By Karla Bowsher on December 21, 2016 Photo by pathdoc / Shutterstock.com Walmart is making headlines for announcing it will close at 6 p.m. on Christmas Eve — two hours earlier than in recent years — to give employees more time with their families. Still, a 6 p.m. closing allows the worst of procrastinators ample hours to shop on the last day before Christmas — and Walmart is hardly alone in offering a late closing. We’ve identified seven national retail chains that have formally announced they will stay open until the evening on Christmas Eve. Keep in mind that these retailers’ announcements might not apply to your local stores. So if you expect to shop right up until the last minute, you might want to confirm your local stores’ hours before leaving home. Here are the opening and closing times that retailers have formally announced: Costco: Open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. JCPenney: Open at 7 a.m. Closing hours vary by state. Kohl’s: Open around the clock from now through Saturday. Closing hours may vary by location. Kmart: Open around the clock from 6 a.m. Thursday until 8 p.m. Saturday.

Here are some last-minute options Published December 21, 2016 Associated Press Facebook0 Twitter0 livefyre Email Print Shoppers fills Macy's in New York City  (AP) NEW YORK –  Holiday shopping procrastinators can breathe easy. Yes, most online shipping deadlines have passed. But many retailers are offering other ways to get gifts at the last minute, whether it's staying open through the wee hours of the night like Toys R Us, or offering Christmas Eve store pickup like Wal-Mart. Here are some options for those still scrambling to buy presents: MIDNIGHT RUNS Many stores are extending their hours in the days leading up to Christmas. Toys R Us will stay open from 6 a.m. on Dec. 23 straight to 9 p.m. on Christmas Eve, while department store Kohl's will stay open from Dec. 20 until Christmas Eve. Certain Macy's department stores will be open all night between Dec. 22 and Dec. 23. Sears will close at midnight through Dec. 23 and close at 6 p.m. on Christmas Eve. And Target will be open from 7 a.m. to midnight through Dec. 23 and stay open until at least 10 p.m. on Christmas Eve. SHOP THE UNEXPECTED If you can't make it to the mall, a quick stop at a drug or specialty store might work. CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid are increasingly stocking their shelves with more toys for the little ones. And those three drugstores also have a big selection of plastic gift cards for use at other stores, such as video game retailer GameStop or bookseller Barnes & Noble. Meanwhile, office supplies store Staples sells flying drones and adult coloring books. And Dick's Sporting Goods has Apple Watches, headphones and GoPro cameras. STORE PICKUP If you want to avoid searching for items in the store, you're in luck. Many retailers let you buy items online and pick them up at a store the same day. After ordering and paying online, walk to a special section of the store with the confirmation email and ID and that's it. Macy's, Target and Best Buy are just some of the stores that offer store pickup. Wal-Mart says customers who order items before 6 p.m. on Dec. 23 can pick them up on Christmas Eve and even launched a website with the items that qualify at walmart.com/lastminutegifts. And at Sears.com, those who opt for store pickup between now and Christmas Eve can get 20 percent off clothing, jewelry and home goods if they type in a special promo code. SEND AN E-GIFT The websites of some major stores are offering a way to give an instant gift, called an e-gift. It's similar to a gift card, but is supposed to be a little more personal: You choose the item you want to buy — say sneakers or a sweater — click the "E-Gift" or "GiftNow" button, pay, and then the recipient gets an email telling them you bought them a gift. The gift receiver accepts it and can make adjustments, such as changing the color or size, before it ships. Or they can just get something else entirely from the store. Expand / Contract The service carries no extra charges to the gift giver or receiver, and is available on several websites, including Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom and Ralph Lauren. SAME-DAY DELIVERY It will cost you more, but if you're desperate, you can get some items delivered the same day you order them online. Macy's offers same-day delivery in some cities and so does Nordstrom. But be aware, some may not deliver on Christmas Eve, like Nordstrom. If you're an Amazon.com Prime member paying the annual fee, the online retailer is lets shoppers in Miami, New York and other cities order toys, electronics and other gifts as late as 9:45 p.m. on Christmas Eve for delivery in two hours, meaning you'll get it before midnight. OR JUST WAIT Procrastination may work in your favor if you end up not seeing a person you're shopping for until after Christmas. That's when after-holiday sales kick in, says Sara Skirboll, a shopping and trends expert at shopping deal app RetailMeNot. If the timing works, you'll likely pay less for a gift than you would if you had bought it before the holidays, says Skirboll.

A security guard discovered Clifford’s body after midnight Saturday. He was naked and with his genitals had been removed, USA Today reported Tuesday. Fred Duran, a representative from Albuquerque law enforcement, said Miller traveled to New Mexico two months ago in hopes of finding employment in Albuquerque. Local police are still trying to determine what happened to Miller in the days leading up to his grisly death, including the motive. An autopsy on the body is pending. It was not immediately clear whether Miller was decapitated before or after he died.  Investigators do not believe Miller was killed in the same place the security guard discovered his body, but have not said where his death may have occurred. Police said they have a suspect in the investigation and urged anyone with relevant information to alert the authorities. “What we know is that his body was put there by someone, we don’t know who, we don’t know how,” Duran told the New York Daily News. Miller was the father of two girls. His 11-year-old son died in car accident nearly four years ago. Chandel Fults, the sister of Miller’s ex-wife, said most of Miller’s extended family members had been notified about his death by Tuesday and were having a difficult time fathoming it.

How would you take it if you had to be told your dad died?” While Duran said investigators were still trying to identify the body on Monday, Jeff Daniels, the communication officer for the Pittsburg County (New Mexico) Sheriff’s Office said law enforcement officers contacted Miller’s father late Sunday night. Fults said Miller had been working for a roofing company in his hometown of McAlester, Oklahoma, before moving to New Mexico. She said she didn’t know what job Miller traveled to Albuquerque to pursue.  Miller had a history with law enforcement.

 Mobile payments technology and contactless payments explained Andrew Meola Dec. 21, 2016, 3:13 PM 3,747 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII The rise of mobile payments technology truly began in 2014 when Apple Pay hit the market. At the time, it was the only major mobile wallet out there. But in the last two years, mobile wallets have flooded the market with offerings such as Samsung Pay, Chase Pay, Android Pay, Microsoft Wallet, Walmart Pay, and Kohl's Pay. Each of these offers unique benefits to the user and encourages customers to form shopping habits around them. And so far, they seem to be succeeding. BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, finds that mobile payment volume will reach $75 billion this year. That figure should swell to $503 billion by 2020 thanks to advancements in mobile payments technology. Below, we've outlined how mobile and contactless payments work and explained the different types of payments technology that are shaping the present and future. What Are Contactless Payments and How Do They Work? To understand how contactless payments work, let's take a hypothetical example. You have an iPhone, which allows you to take advantage of Apple Pay. You input your credit card information onto your phone, which stores it for later use. Later on, you're shopping at a store that has mobile payment readers at the register. Rather than reach for your wallet, you take out your phone and hold it a few inches away from the point-of-sale (POS) terminal. This device then automatically reads the payment information stored on the smart chip embedded in your card and then processes the transaction. Each chip connects to an antenna, and POS terminals emit a high frequency radio wave that facilitates communication between the reader and the phone. When the mobile device is in range, a wireless communication protocol links the terminal and the phone, which exchange information and conduct a secure transaction. All of this occurs in fractions of a second. Near-Field Communication (NFC) Payment Technology Near-field communication, or NFC, technology works by bringing together two electronic devices, typically a mobile device such as a smartphone and a reader of some kind. NFC tech always involves one initiator that generates an RF field to power a passive target. In terms of payments technology, the reader would be the initiator and the smartphone (which contains the stored credit card information) would be the target. The market potential for NFC payment technology is enormous, as merchants have actually been inadvertently rallying behind this type of contactless payment tech. As more U.S. merchants adopt the EMV security standard as of October 1, 2015, they must order new EMV-compliant terminals from major providers such as Verifone and Ingenico. More often than not, these devices accept NFC payments through mobile wallets. In short, EMV will help make NFC technology universal because NFC offers a clear preferred mobile acceptance technology. And this transition is well underway. Verifone said in its Q3 2015 earnings call that NFC terminal penetration had likely reached 100% among top-tier merchants. REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach Bluetooth Payment Technology Bluetooth is a bit of a wild card in the payments industry. Mobile payments technology focuses quite a bit on NFC, and with good reason. But Bluetooth could be the true transformer in this area. All the major mobile platform developers, such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, and BlackBerry have supported Bluetooth for the last several years, but they shifted focus to NFC in the payments world as they released their mobile wallets (Apple Pay, Android Pay, etc.). Bluetooth, however, could change the game. Mobile payments such as Apple Pay have been slow to catch on in certain areas, but Bluetooth likely would not have such problems, especially because it has some inherent advantages. For starters, Bluetooth has a much longer range than NFC, as it can reach up to 50 meters compared to NFC's need to have the two devices centimeters away from each other. This longer range could reduce friction during the checkout process even more than NFC technology already does. On top of this, Bluetooth creates a truly hands-free experience because shoppers would not even need to take out their phones to tap them to a reader.  Furthermore, Bluetooth payment processing is almost always faster than NFC, even if it's by fractions of a second. And finally, NFC is limited to one-to-one interaction, as in one mobile device and one payments reader. But Bluetooth can facilitate multiple transactions at once from a single payments terminal, which would further speed up the checkout process. More to Learn Mobile payments technology will evolve in numerous ways in the coming years, but this is just one piece of the much larger and more complex payments ecosystem. That's why BI Intelligence spent months compiling the greatest and most comprehensive guide on the world of payments entitled The Payments Ecosystem Report: Everything You Need to Know About The Next Era of Payment Processing.

File photo by John Sleezer jsleezer@kcstar.com i By Tony Rizzo trizzo@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story The Johnson County district attorney has ruled that Olathe police officers did not violate Kansas law in the fatal shooting of a man last month outside a Wal-Mart store. Walter Echols was fatally shot Nov. 27 outside a Wal-Mart near Santa Fe Street and Kansas 7. Police said that Echols, 50, of Cypress, Texas, was armed with a blunt object during a disturbance outside the store. One officer was struck by the object, and officers attempted to subdue Echols by nonlethal means before he was shot, according to police. District Attorney Steve Howe said Wednesday in a written statement that after reviewing reports of the county’s multijurisdictional team that investigates officer-involved shootings, he determined that the use of deadly force by officers was justified under Kansas law.

Justin Barkley, 38, accused of murdering William Schumacher, 52, of Candor on Dec. 8, attempted to plead guilty to the charge on Monday in Tompkins County Court but Judge John C. Rowley declined to accept the plea after Barkley claimed he killed Trump, according to The Ithaca Voice. “I shot and killed Donald Trump purposely, intentionally and very proudly,” Barkley said, according to The Voice.

Assistant District Attorney Eliza Filipowski requested that Barkley’s mental state be examined by psychiatrists to see if he is competent to stand trial, The Voice reported. Barkley previously admitted to shooting a man in the chest with a .30-06 caliber rifle. He also “stated that he had intentionally driven over the body of the victim and spun his tires, before subsequently being involved in a brief pursuit with the police behind him.” Leaderboard 2 <a href="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=d282f4125a&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538220188&cs=d282f4125a&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> When Barkley allegedly pulled into the driveway of his Dryden Road home, police say he fired a shot at officers who were pursuing him. In the complaint, Barkley describes that shot as a “sound shot” intended “to prevent the police officers from exiting their patrol vehicles.” The Voice reported that Barkley has also been charged with menacing a police officer or peace officer — a felony. Police took Barkley into custody shortly before 10 a.m. when he walked out of his front door after negotiators used a robot to safely communicate with him. Witnesses had previously told The Sun at the scene of the murder that a white man in a black truck had calmly shot and then run over the UPS driver, later identified as Schumacher. John Thorna, of Newfield, said he heard a single gunshot and looked up to see a UPS driver fall to the ground about 200 feet from Walmart. He said he hadn’t heard any argument or shouting before the gunshot. “A guy was sitting in his truck, and all I heard was a gunshot and looked up, saw the guy fall, and then the guy in the truck backed up, pulled out, ran him over and took off,” he said. The victim was “walking out of the store and the other guy seemed like he was in the truck waiting for him,” Thorna added. Barkley said he knew where Trump would be on the night of the murder and had camped out in the parking lot planning to assassinate him, The Voice reported. Barkley is currently being held in Tompkins County Jail without bail. His next court appearance is Jan. 6 at 2 p.m. Barkley’s attorney, James Baker, could not immediately be reached on Wednesday.

Related Psychiatric Examiners Disagree Over Competency of Alleged Walmart Murderer By Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs 5 hours ago The third examination will begin next week, Assistant District Attorney Eliza Filipowski said. Rowley also scheduled a hearing for later in January to discuss the “conflicting reports.” Ithaca Residents React to Recent City Shooting By Brendan Doyle January 21, 2009 When residents of First Street saw part of their neighborhood being sectioned off with police tape, their emotions ranged from weariness to genuine shock. In a community that is home to a day care center and several houses, a shooting earlier this month was simply too close for comfort. According to neighbors, the police surrounded a nondescript house on the 300 block of First Street on the evening of Jan. 8, where the suspect and several other people exited and were later taken into custody. The shooter was later identified as Caesar Young, 52, of New York City. The victim suffered no fatal injuries. “I was shocked to find out about it,” said Michael Salmines, a music teacher who lives on the corner of the 100 block of First Street. 3 thoughts on “Man Accused of Walmart Murder Says He Killed Donald Trump” What Else Is New on December 23, 2016 at 10:38 pm said: A delusional leftist, how surprising. Everyone’s pretty quiet about this, probably because it doesn’t fit their asinine “durrr must have been a Trump supporter” narrative.

Everyone got into the tech M&A game in 2016 Posted Dec 21, 2016 by John Mannes (@JohnMannes) 0 SHARES Next Story Move over Cas9, CRISPR-Cas3 might hold the key to solving the antibiotics crisis Neither public markets nor tech giants offered any solace in 2016 for the ever-growing list of private unicorns. There are 180 tech companies circling the runway with valuations over $1 billion, the most in history. While interest in an all-expenses paid trip to the NYSE valuation guillotine was at an all-time low, non-traditional Fortune 500 companies did pluck a lucky few from the skies at very serious valuations. Moving into 2017, there’s little indication that trend is going to do anything but accelerate, especially given that every company is now essentially a software company. First came the venture arms, then came the open source projects — now Fortune 500 companies are starting to embrace the idea of fully acquiring very mature tech startups. Walmart’s $3 billion acquisition of Jet.com in August gave hope to unicorn founders that big wins aren’t merely a relic of the past. Continuing into November, the insurance, automotive and consumer goods industries all showed a preference for tech, according to a new report from CB Insights. Data is limited because billion-plus-dollar acquisitions aren’t really a commonplace occurrence, but it’s safe to say that the aforementioned acquisitions generally fall into two categories. Most commonly, traditional players are looking to access new demographics. This was the case with Jet, Dollar Shave Club and to some extent SquareTrade. Walmart’s e-commerce business has been eaten alive by Amazon in recent years, Unilever is getting cornered by a streamlined competitor preaching convenience and Allstate is struggling to get its message across to a millennial generation that has only previously bought insurance for their smartphones. On the other side of the spectrum, some companies, particularly in the automotive sector, are just struggling to keep up. The shift to electric and autonomous vehicles is occurring at roughly the same time, and it is proving to be a challenge for traditional manufacturers. While most of us were not paying attention, major automakers relocated their research and development centers to Silicon Valley and swung out venture arms to start brushing elbows with software engineers. As software continues to eat its way through the world, companies like General Motors have realized that cold hard cash for acquisitions may be the most efficient means of playing catch-up. This comes as mere startups, like Uber, have reached valuations that have surpassed legacy automakers like GM. If 2017 holds to expectations, we will see a greater number of tech IPOs and acquisitions, particularly from non-traditional buyers. It wouldn’t be hard to imagine a startup like Quanergy Systems, which builds LiDAR technology, being acquired by an automotive parts manufacturer looking to cut the corner on innovation like Delphi Automotive. It also wouldn’t surprise me if a strong brand like The Honest Company got picked up by Proctor & Gamble or if a major retailer like Target acquired Fanatics. This is to say nothing of the myriad acquisitions of tech companies with valuations under $1 billion, increasing M&A activity of international companies and the potential for Trump to add fuel to the fire with lower taxes and reduced regulatory oversight.

Anyone who knew Eddie Chandler remembers what a loving giving heart he had. Scott states he had stopped by to get Jason Sanders to put air in his tires, when Eddie asked him if he had any old bicycles. At the time the only one Scott had was for his own children. Scott liked the idea Eddie had of trying to get less fortunate children at Christmas a new bicycle. He shared with Eddie that Frank’s Flea Market was the only place close they might be able to get a few. Which of course purchased several. They still needed more so off to WalMart they went to purchase maybe 10-15, Scott could not remember the exact amount. They stood outside Wal Mart with people stopping and asking about the bikes. Seeing the need of different ones inquiring, they begin to give to those who really needed a bike. Thus began the Eddie Chandler Christmas Bicycle Give Away! The name was not officially given until after Eddie passed away 3 years ago. The second year brought more of an opportunity for Eddie and Scott as The City of Lanett had impounded about 70 bicycles. With this the two were able to go to Wa Mart and purchase more for the give away. The third year Eddie became very ill and before passing away, he asked Scott to please continue the Bicycle give away. Now, Scott Willingham is fulfilling Eddie Chandler’s dream. This is a tough job to take on by yourself so a long time friend who was also involved in the give away, Charles Story had joined forces to keep this dream alive. By the 4th year and sharing on social media, the Eddie Chandler Christmas Bicycle Give Away grew even bigger, adding helmets to the list, therefore, the Chambers County Sheriff’s Department Work Detail crew began to assemble the bikes. The duo enlisted Christian Services in Lanett, ensuring distribution of the bicycles be given to families with a need. Cheryl Myers keeps records of previous donations each year making it much easier for the duo. Donations began to roll in making purchasing the bicycles and helmets a little easier but the need for more was still there. This year Scott and Charles shared they were so thankful to the donations and support from their hometown and surrounding area.. If you knew Eddie Chandler and you spent some time with him you would know he had an” infectious ” personality and hanging around him you would want to help in every way possible. Charles also added “Eddie had a lot of faith in Scott and his humbleness with a desire to help others” as we sat in McDonald’s the two pointed to where Eddie always sat, sharing McDonalds was always his office. The two are looking forward to 2017 and their 6th year of carrying on the legacy of Eddie Chandler.. This season is coming to a close so the two are already making plans for next year. If you would like to participate in the Eddie Chandler Christmas Bicycle Give Away you can contact Scott at 706-518-7743 or Charles 706-773-0742.

Shopping 5 0 0 December 21, 2016 2016 Christmas Hours: What Hours Are Stores And Restaurants Open On Christmas Eve? Danny Cox Christmas 2016 is right around the corner and there really aren’t many days left to pick up any gifts you may need, get presents wrapped, or grab food items needed for dinner. A large number of retailers have chosen against being open at all on the holiday, and more are joining them every single year. Leading up to it, though, many have extended their hours so you can get everything done that you need. Still, Christmas Eve 2016 will have different hours so make sure you know which stores and restaurants are open. Your best bet for getting last-minute shopping done is to do it before Christmas Eve, but there are those times you end up forgetting something. If you need to head out for something, please know that most stores are only open until 9 p.m. at the latest and that doesn’t mean all of them will be. One store being open at the mall doesn’t mean another retailer will be open down the road. [Image by Kena Betancur/Getty Images] Here are the big-time hours you need to know for Christmas Eve 2016 and what time stores will be open until for the last-minute shoppers. Store Business Hours has confirmed that Walmart stores will be closing at 8 p.m. local time again this year on Christmas Eve, and many others are letting employees go home early as well. Academy Sports + Outdoors: 7 a.m. – 6 p.m. Best Buy: 8 a.m. – 6 p.m. BJ’s Wholesale: 9 a.m. – 9 p.m. Costco: 9 a.m. – 5 p.m. Dillards: Open until 6 p.m. GameStop: 8 a.m. – 7 p.m. Hobby Lobby: 9 a.m. – 5:30 p.m. JCPenney: 7 a.m. – 6 p.m. (Some stores not opening until 9 a.m.) Kmart: 8 a.m. – 10 p.m. Kohl’s: Open until 6 p.m. Macy’s: 7 a.m. – 8 p.m. (Some stores closing at 6 p.m.) Office Depot/Office Max: 8 a.m. – 9 p.m. (Some stores closing at 6 p.m.) Sears: Open until 10 p.m. Target: Open until 11 p.m. Toys ‘R’ Us: Open until 9 p.m. (Some locations open until 11 p.m.) Walmart: Open until 8 p.m. While those stores will help those looking for gifts and presents, those needing to get something for their big holiday meal will need to know when it’s too late. Should you need to get some main meals or side dishes, know that places such as Aldi have posted much earlier closing hours than usual on Christmas Eve. Again, remember that hours can change per location and city, so always call ahead to be sure that these hours apply to your local store. Albertsons: 8 a.m. – 8 p.m. Aldi: 8 a.m. – 6 p.m. CVS: Open until 10 p.m. Food Giant: Open until 6 p.m. H-E-B: 6 a.m. – 8 p.m. Kroger: Open until 6 p.m. Publix: Open until 7 p.m. Rite Aid: Open until 7 p.m. (Hours can vary per location) Walgreens: Open until midnight Whole Foods: 8 a.m. – 6 p.m. Winn-Dixie: Open until 10 p.m. (Some locations open until midnight) [Image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images] Pay close attention to the time while you’re out shopping as you don’t want to get hungry and end up at a place you don’t even like. There won’t be a lot of locations with late hours, so be sure that you don’t get stuck without a meal on Christmas Eve. Some places like Domino’s Pizza know that many dining locations close early on Christmas Eve and they are looking to appeal to late-nighters by offering Christmas pizza delivery. Be sure to check with every single location because those which are franchised out can choose their own hours and don’t always abide by company standards. Here are the restaurant hours to keep in mind for when Christmas Eve arrives on Saturday: Applebee’s: Open until 9 p.m. (Some locations open until 2 a.m.) Boston Market: Open until 10 p.m. Buca di Beppo: 11 a.m. – 11 p.m. Buffalo Wild Wings: Open until 6 p.m. Burger King: Open until midnight (Some locations open until 10 p.m.) Cracker Barrel: 6 a.m. – 2 p.m. Denny’s: 24/7 Domino’s: Open until 3 a.m. (Carryout may end earlier) Dunkin’ Donuts: Open until 6 p.m. Golden Corral: Vary by location IHOP: 24/7 for most locations, but some may be 6 a.m. – midnight Jack in the Box: Regular hours per location McDonald’s: Open until 10 p.m. (Will vary by location) Outback Steakhouse: Open until 11 p.m. Panda Express: Open until 10 p.m. Perkins: Open until 2 a.m. Pizza Hut: Open until 8 p.m. Ruby Tuesday: Hours to vary per location Ruth’s Chris Steak House: 4:30 p.m. – 10 p.m. Sizzler: 7 a.m. – 10 p.m. Starbucks Coffee: Locations vary between closing at 10 p.m. or 12 a.m. Steak and Shake: 24/7 Subway: Open until 10 p.m. Taco Bell: Hours vary by location Waffle House: 24/7 Knowing all of this information, you are now prepared to head out and shop on Christmas Eve 2016. You are fully aware of the stores that are open and what hours they will be available for you to shop in them. Dining on Christmas Eve is a bit more limited as many locations will close much earlier than some retail stores and supermarkets/groceries close even earlier.

And too many Americans are one job loss or medical crisis away from food insecurity. Feeding America, the largest nonprofit in the U.S. focused on hunger, has established a network of 200 food banks that’s working to serve three to four billion meals a year to 49 million people in America. “The problem is that they need to be able to serve eight billion meals,” says Neal Myrick, director of social impact at Tableau and head of the Tableau Foundation. “So there’s a tremendous meal gap, between what they’re able to serve and what the need is.” And to do that, Myrick says, real-time data is increasingly essential. “It’s being used more and more to put actionable information in the hands of decision-makers,” he explains. Historically, he says, non-profits have collected data over long stretches of time and evaluated it in traditional backward-looking measurement and evaluation exercises. “The shift that we’re seeing now is that the data is actually being collected in near real time and being used to make decisions and assess program success on a more active and frequent basis,” Myrick says. “At Feeding America, they’re using data to get more food into their supply chain.” The data they pull in from third-party vendors and local grocery stores gives food bank staff insight into donation capacities. “It helps give them a basic understanding of how much the grocery store procures and then how much they sell,” says Myrick. “And they can calculate what that grocery store’s potential donation could be.” For example, they can see that the local Walmart is donating five thousand pounds of food, but the math shows they have the capacity to donate ten thousand. “And what that allows the local food bank manager to do is go have a conversation with that Walmart,” Myrick says. “They brainstorm ideas for how they can get from donating five thousand pounds to donating ten thousand pounds, and get more food into the supply chain for Feeding America to distribute.” Real-time data, transformed into visualizations, are also essential for helping non-profits who are always operating on razor-thin margins, Myrick says. All 200 food banks collect data on twelve specific operating metrics; pooled and visualized, Feeding America has an essential tool at their fingertips. “I can compare myself with other rural food banks around the country on these twelve metrics and I can see where I’m underperforming, I can see where I’m overperforming,” Myrick says. “And what we’re hearing is that having that visibility is encouraging collaboration among the food banks. If I see somebody able to deliver a meal for 25 cents, that gives me an immediate thing to put into my road map and set an objective. And I can call the food bank that’s achieving the 25 and find out what they’re doing to achieve that.” The combination of near-live data and visualization is what powers the ability to stay on top of potential savings and effective strategies. “Imagine having to look through a set of Excel spreadsheets and having to eyeball numbers,” Myrick says. “It’s hard to really have perspective unless you can see yourself in the context of other organizations that are like you. The visualization gives you the ability to instantly see what you should be focused on, and also drill in and get more information.” In the non profit world, where organizations lack the kinds of resources that the business world has, and more than likely don’t have data scientists on hand, visualization is critical for effectiveness and efficiency. Tableau is bringing together its entire community to help nonprofits overcome the resource gap, Myrick says. “Skills and capacity are definitely an obstacle,” he says. “That’s why we invest our entire ecosystem — our employees, our business partners, and our customers all get invited to partner with us to build skills and capacity in the nonprofit sector. We actually teach the nonprofits and build their capacity to use data.” Tableau is also busy breaking down barriers in the nonprofit sector that often slow down or obstruct work on the ground, particularly how data is collected and where it’s delivered. “We’re seeing a shift now. When the data is collected in real time, it can be used more operationally by the nonprofits to make better and smarter decisions on an ongoing basis,” Myrick says. “What we’re finding is we’re enabling people to use real-time data to make better decisions; they actually need to be able to pivot and change directions when the data are showing that what they thought was going to work isn’t working as well as something else.” And in the case of some nonprofits Tableau is working with, like the World Food Programme which is meeting the needs of food-insecure people in conflict and crisis areas struggling to meet their basic needs,  Tableau is also working to deliver food price information back down to local program managers. These on-the-ground aid workers have never before had access to this type of real-time information which is now helping them make informed decisions on the best way to help. “The community is actually benefiting from the data collection exercise,” Myrick says, “and we’re super excited about that.” It’s the future of real-time data for nonprofits, Myrick says. “Data used to be collected to be used by funders, by researchers, and by experts,” he explains. “And especially in low-income and underserved communities in developing countries, the data was really kind of extracted from the community for the benefit of the wealthy.” And those communities oftentimes weren’t able to benefit from the data in return. “What I’m really excited about is we are seeing a shift,” says Myrick. “Part of the responsible use of data is to deliver value back to the community so the community can benefit from the data, not just the funders or the governments or whoever is requiring the data to be collected.” Tableau’s work is keeping that shift in motion. “There are lots of tools out there like Tableau and others that are easy enough to use now where community members can actually not only just get big data sets, but get data delivered in a visual way,” he says. “They can actually make use of it without having to go through weeks and weeks of schooling to figure it out.” “Putting more information and power into the hands of the community is something that we’re super excited about,” he adds. And it’s already changing the world. Beyond nonprofit: Learn more about real-time data in our recent VB Live event.

In the letter, which you can see below, FOP national president Chuck Canterbury writes, “At a time of year when we as a nation and indeed, as a world, should be coming together in hopes of peace on Earth and goodwill toward men, these third party sellers are profiting from racial division. Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another.” Walmart sent a statement to CNNMoney in response that says, “Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise. After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the ‘bulletproof’ reference.” But those appear to be the only items they are taking down. There is still apparel with “Black Lives Matter” on them on Walmart’s website, as well as some with “Blue Lives Matter” printed on. In a follow-up Facebook post, the national FOP said, “The FOP certainly supports the First Amendment and we thank Walmart for taking down the inflammatory messages.” [featured image via Roman Tiraspolsky/Shutterstock] — — Follow Josh Feldman on Twitter: @feldmaniac Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com Follow Mediaite Follow @mediaite Like us on Facebook filed under Black Lives Matter, Fraternal Order of Police, Walmart Around the Web Sign up for the Mediaite newsletter What's Popular ‘F*ck Donald Trump!

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

By Paul Wright December 20, 2016 12:12 GMT The man's body was found behind a Walmart in Albuquerque, police saidGoogle Streetview A security guard made a gruesome discovery in Albuquerque, New Mexico, after the naked body of a man was found beheaded and castrated behind a local Walmart. Officers tentatively described the victim as a 42-year-old while male but said they did not yet know his identity or where he is from. The mutilated remains were discovered by a security officer behind a dumpster adjacent to the Walmart on Wyoming and Menaul Boulevards, in the north-east side of the city, on Saturday morning (17 December). Police say they are still trying to locate the victim's family, being left to rely on fingerprint identification due to the missing head. The cause of death remains unknown and police do not know if the suspected murder is related to drug cartels or gangs. "It's tough. It's not something that's easy to see," Albuquerque Police Department spokesperson Fred Duran told local news channel KOB4. "I've been on scenes when I was working in the field that they're gruesome. "You're walking through things you probably don't want to walk through. You're seeing stuff that you don't want to see, but it's part of our job." Authorities believe the unidentified man was killed elsewhere and later brought to the Walmart. Duran added: "We don't know the specifics of what happened or how the body got there. We do know that the incident did not occur at the Walmart. This seems like it was the end point of the contact between the person who did it and the victim." Police said they are still seeking suspects connected with the death. Anyone with information about the case is being urged to notify Albuquerque Metro Crime Stoppers.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Jennifer Rubin December 20, 2016 Follow @JRubinBlogger China Shipping containers sit on a dock in Los Angeles in 2010. (Lucy Nicholson/Reuters) One hopes that at least one of the billionaires nominated for President-elect Donald Trump’s Cabinet will explain to him that he is doing exactly the wrong things if he thinks China is “eating our lunch” or “killing us” or whatever. (Have you noticed all the Chinese students want to come here to study and remain to work, but virtually no Americans want to go there to study and work? Hmm, maybe they know something Trump doesn’t.) If Trump believes China is beating us in some fashion, he has picked two of the most misguided policies, neither of which is going to make us “win” more. First, Trump’s notion of applying 35 percent tariffs would be a big blow to the people who elected him, not China. The 35 percent tariff would not be paid in Beijing. It’s paid at Walmart, Costco and anyplace else Americans buy things. As Scott Lincicome explained nearly a year ago: This, of course, means that American families, many of whom are already struggling to get by, would end up paying more—a lot more—for food, clothing, electronics, and everything else that now says “Made in China.” The Trump tariff is in essence a high tax on much of what Americans now buy from Target, Walmart, Amazon, and other major retailers—a tax that hurts poor and middle-class Americans far more than it hurts rich ones like Donald Trump. Individuals wouldn’t be the only ones screwed by the Trump tariff. American businesses (and their many workers) would also be hit. Because almost half of what we import from China is industrial supplies and materials or non-automotive capital goods (i.e., inputs used by American manufacturers), many of these firms would pay more for the things they need to remain globally competitive. These higher costs, of course, also mean fewer employees, if not outright bankruptcy. The entire notion that we can lure back low-skill jobs to the United States is so silly that even many of the people Trump is pandering to do not buy it. They know that “some of these jobs are dying.” If those jobs ever came back, in all likelihood a good deal of them wouldn’t be filled by humans; automation would continue apace. Virtually every economist will tell you, “While improvements in productivity have slowed in recent years, those decades of efficiency upgrades aren’t going away. That means it’s unlikely that the U.S. will restore the bulk of lost manufacturing jobs, no matter how many deals President-elect Trump can pull off.” So tariffs hurt American consumers, particularly lower-income consumers. Those jobs, in any event, don’t come back. Trump doesn’t have to take our word for it. Trump can talk to his nominee for commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, who explained in 2012: “The reality is if something were to happen that cost China jobs — like if they upwardly revalued the currency a lot — those jobs aren’t going to come back to the U.S. They would go to Vietnam, they would go to Thailand. They would go to whatever country was the lowest cost.” He added: “So it’s a fiction on both sides that those jobs will come back. The way we’ll get more jobs is by creating new industries, new companies, businesses that are higher tech and therefore can compete.” If Trump does nothing in this regard, American consumers and workers alike would be better off. Manufacturing has rebounded (albeit with fewer workers because of automation). Moreover, the trade deficit has little, if anything, to do with growth and jobs. That’s why we are growing and adding jobs as our trade deficit widens. Meanwhile, Trump’s crusade against the Trans-Pacific Partnership deals a double blow to the United States. Doug Bandow of the Cato Institute reminds us that “an American commercial retreat would leave Asia open for Chinese domination. No surprise, Beijing would be only too happy to grab economic leadership in the Asia-Pacific.” He cautioned: The U.S. economy remains more sophisticated, innovative, and transparent than China’s economy. Investors and traders in America benefit from the rule of law, democratic process, and respect for human rights. Nevertheless, geography gives the People’s Republic of China an important advantage. China already is the biggest investor and trader in the region. Even South Korea, a long-time American military ally, trades more with the PRC than with the U.S. and Japan combined. Moreover, Beijing has been pushing its own trade agreements. Chinese President Xi Jinping told business leaders at a Pacific Rim summit: “China will not shut the door to the outside world but will open it even wider,” in sharp contrast to President-elect Trump’s plans. The PRC already has reached FTAs with several TPP signatories. Beijing also is pushing a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific and an expanded, 16-member version of ASEAN’s Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. America’s trading partners, but not America, would be invited to join these networks. In this case Beijing, not Washington, would be choosing participants. Beijing also would be creating commercial structures and writing investment and trade rules for the world’s most dynamic economic region. These agreements would not have the labor and environmental standards favored by U.S. negotiators. We wouldn’t be winning at all. (“Economists Peter A. Petri and Michael G. Plummer concluded: ‘Delaying the launch of the TPP by even one year would represent a $77 billion permanent loss.'”) As one trade guru put it: “The absence of a U.S.-led TPP would be a nice Lunar New Year’s gift to President Xi Jinping. Happy Year of the Rooster! In short, Trump’s tariff scheme against China and retreat from the TPP won’t help American workers, but they will help China, hurt U.S. consumers and close off markets for American firms that need global markets to grow and add workers. What would work? Most economists and American employers agree: Improve education and training for U.S. workers. That requires “manufacturing innovation to keep U.S. factories in the lead; ensuring that workers get industry-relevant training that equips them for today’s digital factories; and supporting the nation’s regional clusters of advanced industry, whether in Grand Rapids or Pittsburgh.” That would certainly cost something, but it’s surely better than counterproductive Trumpian schemes. opinions right-turn Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.

She was arrested and removed from the area. Friday, Dec. 9 Theft: At 4:40 p.m., the owner of two stolen bicycles spotted them on the OfferUp website. The victim agreed to meet 43-year-old Cynthia Vazquez at Statewide Self Storage on Verne Roberts Circle to “buy” the bikes but also contacted police, who were there waiting when Vazquez and 38-year-old Benjamin Jimenez showed up with the goods. Both were already on misdemeanor probation for possession of stolen property, and Vazquez admitted she had a storage unit at the facility. Officers found her car parked outside the unit and when they searched it, they found two methamphetamine pipes along with a small amount of the drug in Vazquez’s purse. Although Vazquez and Jimenez both denied knowing the bicycles were stolen, they were cited for possession of stolen property and drug-related offenses. Drunken driving: At 9:07 p.m., officers were stopped on  L St. at W. 18th St. after having pulled over a vehicle when they heard tires screeching. Police saw 33-year-old Jose Camerena sliding to a stop on W. 18th St. into the back of a truck that was stopped at the intersection. Camerena then backed up and drove around the truck, fleeing the scene. He turned north on L Street and refused to stop for officers who were attempting to catch him on foot. However, one officer returned to his car and caught up with Camerena on Leggett Street. Camerena, who was found to be intoxicated, was arrested without incident and taken to the county jail on suspicion of drunken driving and evading police. Robbery: At 9:13 p.m., police responded to a report of a robbery on Madrone Street, where a couple of people were inside their open garage when a man wearing mask walked up the driveway. He pointed a firearm at them and demanded money. After the victims handed over their wallets and an iPad, the intruder fled into a nearby park. Although police, including a K-9 unit, canvassed the area, they did not find the robber. Saturday, Dec. 10 Theft: At 3:30 pm, police received a report from Fallas in the Somersville Towne Center at 2550 Somersville Road. A security guard had watched 25-year-old Farahaisha Miller pay for merchandise and then, as she was leaving the store, grab a pair of shoes. Police cited Miller for theft and released her. Theft: At 5 p.m., police received a report that a security guard in Target at 5769 Lone Tree Way had watched 57-year-old Cynthia Turner bypass cash registers with numerous items in her shopping cart. The stolen goods were worth more than $600. Turner was cited for the theft and released. Theft: At 5:30 p.m., police responded to a report from Fallas in the Somersville Towne Center at 2550 Somersville Road. The discount store reported that one of its security guards had detained a man after watching him walk out with stolen merchandise. Police found that 41-year-old Bryan Thompson also was carrying what they believed to be methamphetamine. A records check revealed that Thompson already was on probation for petty theft, shoplifting and narcotics possession. He was arrested and taken to the county jail, where he was booked on a probation violation, theft and drug charges. Fighting: At 8:30 p.m., police responded to a report by Wal-Mart employees of a man who had tried to fight with customers and now was refusing to leave the store at 4893 Lone Tree Way. Officers escorted 19-year-old Tevin Herron off the premises with the warning that Wal-Mart would have him arrested if he returned. But about an hour later, police received a call that Herron had returned. He was arrested and taken to the county jail. Sunday, Dec. 11 Drunken driving: At 1:26 a.m., police responded to a report of a vehicle blocking traffic in the 600 block of Wilbur Avenue. They found the driver passed out behind the wheel. Officers arrested 24-year-old Angelino Verbis for drunken driving and took him to the county jail. Shots fired: At 4:15 pm, officers responded to a report of shots fired in the 2600 block of Forty Niner Way. They found several shell casings in front of a house and several bullet holes in the garage door. The residents were uncooperative, however, and provided no information to identify the suspects. But a witness described seeing a silver sedan drive by and a male passenger reaching out the car window to fire at the house. Thefts: At 5:50 p.m., police responded to a call from JCPenney at 4951 Slatten Ranch Road, which reported that a couple was shoplifting, putting the merchandise in their truck and then returning to continue stealing. Officers waited outside the doors until 30-year-old Jeffry Harrison and 22-year-old Jasmine Vega came back outside carrying stolen goods. They admitted to the thefts, were arrested, and taken to the county jail for probation violations and shoplifting. Drug possession: At 10:10 p.m., an officer pulled over a minivan for a Vehicle Code violation and found that 26-year-old James Mcevoy had two outstanding warrants and was on probation. His passenger, 25-year-old Eduardo Rankin, was on parole and had a baggie of suspected methamphetamine next to him. Although Mcevoy admitted the drug was his, he could not explain how it ended up next to Rankin. Both men were arrested and taken to the county jail. Stolen vehicle: At 11:36 p.m., an officer stopped a suspicious vehicle at Contra Loma Regional Park. A records check showed the license plate of the occupied Honda to be lost or stolen. Pittsburg police contacted the registered owner of the car and learned that it had not been reported as stolen. The driver, 27-year-old Miguel Murillo and his passenger, 45-year-old Gerardo Castrejon, werearrested. Castrejon also had an outstanding warrant. Both men were taken to the county jail. Monday, Dec. 12 Theft: At 7:15 p.m., employees at the 99 Cents Only Store at 2515 Somersville Road alerted police that they thought 25-year-old James Yingling had shoplifted. When officers detained Yingling he said, “Please don’t run my name, I have a warrant.” A records check revealed that he had two outstanding warrants. The store retrieved the stolen merchandise and declined to press charges. Yingling was arrested and taken to the county jail in Martinez. Outstanding warrant: At 11:00 p.m., an officer recognized 49-year-old Derrick Battle from previous contacts that Battle had had with law enforcement. The officer ran a check on Battle and, discovering he had an outstanding warrant, arrested him. Battle thanked the officer for taking him to jail so he could “sort it out.” Tuesday, Dec. 13 Robbery: At 9:29 a.m., police responded to a report of a robbery at the Walgreens pharmacy at 3416 Deer Valley Road. Lawrence Worthy, 41, reportedly entered the store and robbed a clerk at gunpoint. He fled with the cash, but officers caught up with his vehicle nearby. Worthy was positively identified as the gunman and taken to the county jail in Martinez for armed robbery and a probation violation. Stolen vehicle: At 6 p.m., an officer checked the records of a white Honda that was traveling in front of him on Lone Tree Way and found that the vehicle was stolen. The officer conducted a high-risk stop in the drive-thru of the Burger King and arrested the driver, 27-year-old Miguel Carpano. The suspect was taken to the county jail in Martinez on suspicion of auto theft. Outstanding warrants: At 7 p.m., an officer found 68-year-old James Wedding sleeping under a blanket behind the former CVS pharmacy at 2511 Somersville Road.

By Michael Purdy Tulsa, Okla. — A 36-year-old man faces a laundry list of crimes, after a trip to a Tulsa Walmart on Monday. First, Jarrod Barnes is accused of following a woman around the 66th and Memorial location.  However, things only got worse from there. "The victim stated the subject came up behind her and rubbed his (genitals) on her buttocks through clothing," police said.  "When the victim pulled away, the subject then rubbed his (genitals) against her side through clothing.  When the victim moved again, the subject then rubbed his (genitals) against her other side through clothing." He was taken into custody by Walmart Loss Prevention, before being turned over to officers.  However, Barnes wasn't done while being booked. "He stated, 'when I get out I'm going to beat you to death, you (curse, racist word) officer,'" police said.  "Subject also stated that he was a 'shot caller' in the Irish mob and he put his arresting officers on a 'hit list.'" Barnes faces a variety of counts including sexual battery and stalking.   [Information from arrest and booking report] There are no comments yet. Be the first to post your thoughts.

(REUTERS/Rebecca Cook)    4443001 Video footage taken from a Florida Wal-Mart shows a shopper literally jumping the gun. The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

By Aimee Picchi MoneyWatch December 20, 2016, 2:10 PM Amazon, Walmart urged to stop selling "spying" doll Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email Consumer advocates are pressing retailers including Amazon.com (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT) to stop selling a doll that can eavesdrop on children and families. The groups are asking the retailers to discontinue sales of the doll My Friend Cayla following a complaint they filed earlier this month with the Federal Trade Commission. The complaint alleges the doll and another toy, which isn’t sold in the U.S., can send recordings to Nuance Communications (NUAN). The speech-to-text software company has contracts with military and law enforcement agencies, among other customers. Play Video CBSN Fake "Happy Hour Playset " sparks outrage A spoof "Happy Hour Playset" is sparking outrage online. The toy isn't real -- but many people fell for it. CBSN's Josh Elliott has more on Fishe... The doll, made by interactive toy maker Genesis, are no laughing matter, according to the consumer privacy advocates, who say that these and other wireless-enabled devices can open the door to hackers, privacy violations and other unsavory behavior. In the case of My Friend Cayla, the doll is programmed to respond to a child’s questions; it uses equipment including a Bluetooth microphone and a mobile application, which requests access to the parents’ or child’s devices, such as its hardware, storage and Wi-Fi connections.  “My Friend Cayla poses significant security risks that could place children in physical danger,” Josh Golin, executive director of Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, wrote in a letter sent Tuesday to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. “Genesis fails to require basic authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized Bluetooth connections between the doll and a smartphone or tablet.” He added, “As a result, a stranger or potential predator within a 50-foot range can easily establish a Bluetooth connection with the doll, eavesdrop on the child, and even converse with the child through the doll.” A similar letter, also signed by the Center for Digital Democracy and the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), were also sent to Walmart, Target (TGT) and Toys ‘R’ Us. Toys R Us said the doll is no longer for sale at its stores or through its website.  13 Photos Hall of fame toys Meet the 3 inductees, 9 finalists chosen for their iconic status Claire Gartland, who directs the Consumer Privacy Project at EPIC, told CBS MoneyWatch earlier this month that the toys “normalize surveillance to young children,” teaching them that it’s not unusual to have a trusted toy recording their conversations and relaying their words to corporations.   My Friend Cayla, which costs $59.93 at Walmart, is described as “a wonderful choice for a young child who needs a companion.” Customers who reviewed the doll on the retailer’s site give it an average of four stars out of five. Complaints tend to focus on issues such as the quality of the doll’s construction, rather than privacy concerns.  Retailers in Europe that have pulled My Friend Cayla and another toy made by Genesis, a robot called i-Que, include Jollyroom and Amazon Spain, while others such as Top-Toy are offering refunds, the consumer advocacy groups said in the letter.  “When companies collect personal information from children, they incur serious legal obligations to protect children’s privacy,” the letter said. “It is incumbent upon retailers like Amazon to act swiftly to ensure these harms are mitigated to the greatest extent possible.” © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc..

A man’s body was found decapitated and missing genitals behind the Walmart at Menaul and Wyoming early Saturday morning. (Roberto E. Rosales/Journal) Clifford Miller, 42. (Courtesy of the Tulsa World) ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Two months ago Clifford Miller left Oklahoma, and his two children and an ex-wife, to pursue a job offer in New Mexico. But shortly after midnight Saturday, a security guard found the 42-year-old man’s mutilated and decapitated naked body behind a Northeast Albuquerque Wal-Mart, a spokesman for the Albuquerque Police Department announced in a Monday afternoon news conference. His genitals had been cut off. By Tuesday, Miller’s extended family had heard the news and were struggling to process it. Advertisement Continue reading Chandel Fults, the sister of Miller’s ex-wife,said Miller’s 11-year-old son died in a car crash almost four years ago. She said he had two daughters and was trying to reconnect with the oldest one. “(Miller’s ex-wife) was crying when I talked to her,” Fults said. “I had to tell her oldest daughter myself. How would you take it if you had to be told your dad died?” Fults said she wasn’t sure what job Miller had traveled to Albuquerque for, but said he had been a long-time employee at a roofing company in his hometown of McAlester, Okla. APD spokesman Fred Duran said homicide detectives don’t think Miller was killed at the Wal-Mart, on Wyoming near Menaul NE, but they would not say where they think he was killed. There is no suspect information, he said. Duran said the Office of the Medical Investigator will determine how he died and whether he was decapitated after his death. A spokesman for the FBI said the agency is not involved in the investigation. Although Duran said Monday that detectives were still trying to identify the body and find next of kin, Jeff Daniels, the communications officer with the Pittsburg County Sheriff’s Office, said his deputies contacted Miller’s father late Sunday. Miller had been charged with multiple misdemeanors and was charged with felony possession of marijuana and cultivating marijuana in the 1990s, but Fults said she didn’t know of anything that could have hinted he’d meet his end in such a brutal fashion. “I don’t see him as a person that this could actually happen to,” Fults said. “He was goofy, he wasn’t into drugs or anything. He was a good guy.” Journal staff writers Robert Browman and Nicole Perez contributed to this report.

News Sports Life Obituaries E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Hear the sirens, get a toy: Christmas Cops and Kids volunteers make final push for toys Tuesday Dec 20, 2016 at 11:59 AM Dec 20, 2016 at 12:00 PM Mike Lamb @mlambdispatch BARSTOW — If you are a kid on the morning of Dec. 24, retired Barstow Police Officer Tim Heiden has advice for you. "When you hear the sirens and see the lights, don't run, don't hide, don't flush the toilet. Come out and get a toy," Heiden said Saturday. "We don't stop in front of every house. We will stop in their area. When they hear the sirens, turn the lights on the 24th, go outside. Wrap up your babies and go outside, because they are there." Heiden and other Christmas Cops and Kids volunteers were recently sitting outside the entrance to Wal-Mart collecting cash and toys. The volunteers have camped outside the Wal-Mart on Fridays and Saturdays since Black Friday. Saturday was the final push to collect toys. Heiden said this year the drive is dedicated to volunteer Linda Eason, who is battling cancer. About 200 volunteers are scheduled to head out to all the Barstow, Lenwood, Grandview and Hinkley neighborhoods to pass out toys to every child who shows up Christmas Eve morning. "We have seven teams and they are all divided into geographic areas," Heiden said. "When we stop, whoever comes, the only requirement is the child has to be present. And we don't have paperwork. We don't check their ages. We don't do anything like that." Heiden said the final push has collected more cash than previous years. "Every year we have struggled for money. Every year. This year we have been blessed. A matter of fact, this afternoon we are going to spend $5,000 on more toys," he said. Heiden told the story of a little boy who won a bike in a contest and decided to donate the new bike. He said one woman also donated a bike because Christmas Cops and Kids helped her so many times in the past. "Everybody can get a toy and that's what it's all about. It's not about mom and dad having money," Heiden said. "It's about every child being able to see the police officer and know we care about you. Not only do we care about you, we want you to know we are here for you."  Mike Lamb can be reached at 760-957-0613 or mlamb@desertdispatch.com. You can also follow him on Twitter@mlambdispatch.

(REUTERS/Rebecca Cook)    4443001 Video footage taken from a Florida Wal-Mart shows a shopper literally jumping the gun. The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Anti-poverty effort gets $250,000 from Walmart Foundation By ANNE SAUNDERS Rochester Business Journal December 20, 2016 The Rochester-Monroe Anti-Poverty Initiative is benefitting from a $250,000 donation from the Walmart Foundation’s State Giving Program. The funds will go toward the new adult mentoring programs launching in 2017 and intended to help those in poverty set goals, find good jobs and overcome barriers to financial independence, officials said. The money also will help parents of young children by providing early childhood development services focusing on health education and school readiness. “The Walmart Foundation’s generosity is fueling our capability to support the Rochester and Monroe County region with critical strategies and services that will affect hundreds of local people directly and will benefit thousands of family and community members in the process,” said Fran Weisberg, president and CEO of United Way of Greater Rochester Inc., which oversees RMAPI, an effort involving a coalition of local agencies. “By bringing together a diverse coalition of community and faith-based groups as well as partners in local and state government, United Way has developed a truly groundbreaking strategy to lift people out of poverty. Walmart is thrilled to be a partner in this effort,” said Jason Klipa, Walmart’s director of public affairs and government relations.

Woman stole wallet of Christmas-shopping teen, cops say Alleged wallet thief Police say this woman stole a wallet dropped by a teenager at Walmart on Sunday. (Riverdale Police Department) Print Email Justin Zaremba | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com By Justin Zaremba | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com The Star-Ledger Email the author on December 20, 2016 at 4:53 PM, updated December 20, 2016 at 7:51 PM comments RIVERDALE -- Police are asking for the public's help in identifying a Grinch who nearly ruined Christmas for one family.  A 15-year-old girl was shopping at Walmart on Sunday for a Christmas present for her grandmother when she dropped her wallet containing $130 in cash, Riverdale Lt. James MacIntosh said in a news release. Instead of picking the teen's wallet up and returning it to her, a woman was caught on security cameras walking over and kicking the wallet away from the girl while she was still standing next to it, MacIntosh said. The woman, who was described as being in her 50s and having sandy-colored hair, then allegedly picked up the wallet and left the store with it. The woman, MacIntosh said, also did not return it to Walmart or turn it into the police department. Despite the theft, the victim's Christmas spirit appeared to be intact. Two days after the theft, Walmart gave the teen a gift card so she could purchase a gift, but the girl instead chose to donate the card to charity.  Anyone who has information about this theft or recognizes this woman can contact the Riverdale Police Department at 973-835-0034 and ask for the Detective Bureau.

Investigators did not confirm a motive for the grisly killing. However, they do not believe Miller was killed in the same area where a security guard discovered his mutilated body. “What we know is that his body was put there by someone, we don’t know who, we don’t know how,” Officer Fred Duran told the Daily News.

Journal Published 7:54 p.m. ET Dec. 20, 2016 | Updated 8:36 p.m. ET Dec. 20, 2016 Ithaca mayor Svante Myrick credited all of the police departments who helped bring Thursday's standoff to a peaceful end. (Photo: Matt Weinstein / staff photo) ITHACA, N.Y. — The Dryden man accused of killing a UPS driver in the parking lot of an Ithaca Walmart claimed in court Monday he believed he shot and killed President-elect Donald Trump. Justin Barkley, 38, was in Tompkins County Court on Monday to plead guilty to the murder of 52-year-old Candor resident William Schumacher on Dec. 8 outside the Walmart store at 135 Fairgrounds Memorial Parkway in Ithaca. Judge John Rowley did not accept the plea following Barkley’s comments about Trump and adjourned the indictment to Jan. 6. Rowley also ordered Barkley to be evaluated to determine whether he is competent to stand trial. USA TODAY NYC mayor wants $35 million for Trump Tower security Prosecutors say the Dryden resident intentionally caused the death of Schumacher — the two men were strangers — early Dec. 8. Barkley was indicted last week in Tompkins County Court on felony counts of second-degree murder and menacing a police officer or peace officer. After fleeing from the scene, court papers say, Barkley fired a "sound shot" from his rifle to keep law enforcement officers from coming after him once he pulled into the driveway of his Dryden Road home. After a nearly eight-hour standoff, Barkley was taken into custody without a struggle and no injuries to himself or police. Justin Barkley  (Photo: Ithaca Police Department) If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 25 years to life in state prison. Schumacher was a seasonal UPS driver who had stopped to get something to eat during his overnight shift, according to Susan Rosenberg, a spokeswoman for the Atlanta-based package delivery company. He was about four weeks into his second stint as a seasonal driver of a tractor-trailer hauling packages between UPS processing hubs, she said. A suspected motive in the crime remains undisclosed by law enforcement officials, though court records indicate Barkley confessed to the murder after being taken into custody. The homicide took place shortly before 1 a.m., and court papers describe a relatively quiet late night around the Walmart store, with some customers picking up merchandise or waiting in their cars, moments before they heard gunfire.

They had several colors to choose from, white, orange, red and peach. Cats need love I feel so sorry for the cat and all the suffering it went through. I have a loving cat and that would kill me if that happened to her. So cruel and heartless! Bowling for mediocrity Why are there so many bowl games? It used to mean something to be invited to a bowl game, but not anymore. There are so many it is impossible to keep up with them, and when a team has more losses than wins and still gets in a bowl game? That is just wrong. I am waiting for Northern Tissue to come up with the Toilet Bowl for the two worst teams in the nation. Where’s the joy? Less than a week until Christmas, I cannot find the joy of the season. I travel along our beautiful coast in fear as drivers ignore speed limits, tailgate, run through traffic lights or fail to yield to fire trucks or ambulances on their way to those in need. We beat puppies and scald cats, leaving them to die abandoned and alone. Elderly are pushed to the ground and robbed. People take what they want from store shelves and brazenly walk out, injuring employees or a good Samaritan who may get in their way. We molest our precious children. We disrespect our brave police officers at parades or community events. A waitress is murdered for simply asking a patron not to smoke. We elect a president who mocks the disabled, disrespects the family of a fallen hero, delights in assaulting women and reveres a communist leader. The spirit of Christmas? I can’t seem to find it. Make American great again? Oh, if only we could.   Dangerous diamond The diamond intersection over by the mall certainly doesn’t work at all with heavy traffic. There isn’t enough room to get all the waiting cars between the lights on the overpass. It takes multiple cycles to get through. What engineer designed this thing? To paraphrase Red Skelton, MDOT must be really proud of him over at the asylum. What do they sacrifice? The more I read about this new budget for the state the more questions I have. These so called great leaders of this state want to cut programs aimed at helping people and cut state jobs. That is not being responsible. But what I have not seen is them saying they will cut back on their pay or benefits. When they propose changes to our states budget, it always seems to help themselves and hurt us. We need new state leadership and soon. Send your Sound Off comments to soundoff@sunherald.com for consideration for publication.

(SIRI) Stock Is As Solid As Ever It’s not all doom and gloom for SIRI stock By Laura Hoy, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Dec 22, 2016, 6:30 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: This Is Why Under Armour Inc (UA) Stock Could Have a Bang-Up Year Why Target Corporation (TGT) Stock Will Lag Behind in 2017 Should You Buy Amazon.com, Inc.

Worries about whether satellite radio would continue to capture the public’s interest as connected cars develop have been an anchor for the SIRI stock price. However, Sirius XM has proven resilient over the last few years and the company’s future growth prospects don’t look too shabby. Source: Vinod Sankar via Flickr Sure, SIRI stock isn’t going to be a high growth engine, but at under $10 per share, it makes for a cheap buy that is likely to continue rising in the coming year. Here’s a look at three reasons traders shouldn’t bet against Sirius XM stock. SIRI Stock: It’s Not As Bad As It Looks One of the biggest reasons traders are betting against SIRI stock is the growing amount of technology that can be found in automobiles. Sirius XM is a popular addition to automobiles, so the idea is that with connected cars offering more ways for users to connect their own streaming services via their smartphone or tablet, satellite radio systems will become obsolete. While this may be true in say, a decade, there are still plenty of cars on the road without that kind of technology, and for that matter plenty of connected cars with owners that don’t completely understand, or aren’t willing to use all of the features their car is offering. SIRI gives people who don’t want or can’t afford a connected car an entertainment option, and that is still a reasonably large market. The 7 Best Monthly Dividend Stocks for 2017 Not only that, but Sirius XM stock doesn’t look bad when you examine its financials either. The company’s most recent earnings report showed that management is expecting to generate around $1.5 billion in free cash flow this year. That means the firm will likely continue to return that money to shareholders through buybacks and it gives the firm more potential to make strategic acquisitions. Sirius XM Acquisition Rumors Speaking of acquisitions, SIRI stock has the potential to gain significantly in the New Year if rumors about a potential acquisition of Pandora Media Inc (NYSE:P) are true. Pandora struggled as the music streaming space became more crowded, but the firm is ripe for a takeover. If the two companies were to join forces, it could be a big bump for Sirius XM as Pandora’s $1.4 billion worth of revenue and the firm’s advertising partnerships could be valuable additions to the SIRI family.

Palermo Sr., 85, of West Pittston, passed away Sunday, Dec. 18, 2016, in Geisinger Wyoming Valley Medical Center following a brief illness, surrounded by his family. Born Aug. 14, 1931, in Pittston, he was the son of the late Archangelo and Grace Maira Palermo. Louis attended West Pittston schools and was an Army veteran of the Korean War. He spent his early years in the garment industry, he was a truck driver, and also worked in a steel mill before settling into a job at the Tobyhanna Army Depot, where he worked for 28 years. Upon retirement, he began a few new jobs, one being a teacher's associate for special needs children at Wyoming Area schools, where he was affectionately known as "Mr. P." He worked for Fino's Pharmacy in Pittston delivering medications. His most recent job was at Wal-Mart in Pittston. He worked there for 17 years, starting as a greeter, then in the sporting goods department. He always had a warm smile for the customers as well as his co-workers and would often say "God bless" when they were leaving. Through the years he was involved in several organizations, including the Goodwill Volunteer Hose Company, West Pittston No. 1 Hose Company, the Italian American Association, American Legion, Dupont, and was past master of St. John's Lodge 233 in Yatesville. Louis also enjoyed hunting, fishing and collecting coins. He was preceded in death by his parents; brothers, Anthony and Salvatore Palermo; and sisters, Mary Russo, Josephine Mantione, Susan Shannon, Angeline Shean, Grace LaCava and Rose DiTulo. He is survived by his wife of 57 years, Dorothy Race Palermo; daughter, Linda (Angelo) Salerno; son, Louis (Kim) Palermo Jr.; grandchildren, Angelo and Michelle Salerno and Bianca, Louis III and Michael Palermo; and great-grandchildren, Cody and Shawn Salerno, Elijah Rudda and Kaleb and Isabella McManis; as well as his brother, Angelo Palermo; sister-in-law, Carmella Palermo; brother-in-law, George DiTulo; and numerous nieces and nephews.

Mike Wolanin | The Republic Local News Shop with a Cop returns with heart-warming stories By Mark Webber - 12/20/16 10:27 PM We’ve learned from Hollywood how irresistible it can be when opposites match up — tough, streetwise police officers and young children, for example. Audiences witnessed that in feature films such as “Kindergarten Cop” (1990) with Arnold Schwarzenegger and “Cop and a Half” (2003) starring Burt Reynolds. “It is a great contrast to see the little guy looking up at the big officer,” said Indiana State Police trooper Edward Olibo, who had a starring role in “Shop with a Cop,” which had a return engagement on Sunday. That’s not another hit film, but a long-running program that has enabled local law-enforcement officials to pair up with children from families in need of a boost.

Mike Wolanin | The Republic Click here to purchase photos from this gallery Rather than investigating a potential crime spree, participating officers in Shop with a Cop spend their day off take kids on a shopping spree. While the event in its current format began in 1994, event chairman Lt. Alan Trisler said Shop with a Cop actually began at least 10 years before that. Last weekend, the script again played out when police officers met at the west side Columbus Walmart and spent the afternoon helping about 130 children spend $200 on Christmas presents — on donors’ dime. “Our purpose is two-fold,” said Trisler, who is president of the Fraternal Order of Police Local 89. “First, it’s to provide for kids in need. Second, we provide them a positive experience with law enforcement. Each is equally important,” Trisler said. CamRon Stillabower, 10, had no idea what type of toy he wanted. He seemed content just to get two new pair of blue jeans. “He’s a great kid,” said Bartholomew County Sheriff’s deputy Andrew Dougan, the youth’s shopping buddy. “He knows what he needs, and we’ll make sure he’ll have the clothes he needs to get through the winter.” The Schmidt Elementary fifth-grader said he was appreciative of the participating police officers — and not just for helping him navigate the store aisles. “If anything goes wrong, cops are there to protect everyone,” CamRon said. “I think they’re awesome.” Elsewhere in the store, 6-year-old Bentley Newman couldn’t make up his mind in the toy aisle. Would he pick the Rogue One Light Saber, Adventure Force Enforcer Belt Blaster or the Air Warriors Sidewinder? Sometimes they just need a little nudge, Clifford Town Marshal Charlie Deweese said. “While the first gal I took shopping today knew exactly what she wanted. The young ones take a lot of patience,” he said. “It’s a lot of fun, and I thoroughly enjoy it.” Sometimes parents who see a uniformed officer in a store will threaten to have their children arrested if they misbehave, said former Chicago patrolwoman Arlene Moffitt, now retired and living in Brown County. “That really drives me nuts,” Moffitt said. “Programs like Shop With a Cop teach impressionable children we’re the good guys.” When 10-year-old Faith Burns needed help choosing clothing and toys, Columbus police officer Bernard Sims recruited his teenage daughter, Jordan, to assist. When Faith began to smile and giggle during the interaction, tears of joy began to well up in Melissa Worton’s eyes. Faith’s aunt said she has seldom seen her niece happy since the accidental death of her parents. Besides helping victims of tragedies, Shop With a Cop assures children from households in distress that they will not be forgotten at Christmas, Trisler said. He recalled one year when two young sisters arrived in sub-zero temperatures with one winter coat between them. “Whenever one became too cold, her sister would hand over the coat for awhile,” Trisler said. “But by the time those girls left, they had a coat to spare.” The generosity seemed to be contagious on Sunday, and not just among the police officers. Host Walmart donated $2,000 to the program. Store cashiers who normally are off on Sundays volunteered to come in and run two check-out lanes devoted exclusively to the four-hour event. Just seconds after a donation jar was set up, twenty-dollar bills seemed to magically appear without anyone seeing who donated. A few minutes later, one couple handled organizers a $100 bill. “We want to bring the best out in people, and see that as our responsibility,” Columbus Police Chief Jon Rohde said. By the numbers $40,000: Goal for this year’s Shop with a Cop program, which the local campaign expects to hit after a Central Federal Credit Union fundraising campaign ends this week, Fraternal Order of Police Local 89 president Alan Trisler said. 130: Number of children taken on a shopping spree Sunday, similar to numbers from the prior two years.

So she was heartened to find more than one option in the Our Generation line, a less-expensive alternative to American Girl, while perusing the toy aisles of Target. After some deliberation, she picked out a doll named Nahla, whose skin is a bit darker than her daughter’s but whose curly hair was pretty close. Richard Barry, chief merchandising officer for Toys R Us, said the changes in the toy aisles are happening as toymakers and retailers alike are finally listening to customers’ demands for more diversity. “We hear from customers,” he said. “We get applauded on the things we have, but they are also very keen to tell us the things we don’t or the things they would like us to have. We feed that back to our manufacturing partners.” The need for more multicultural options was one of the insights Toys R Us took to heart when developing its private-label line of dolls called Journey Girls. Launched in 2010 with four dolls, it has expanded to seven dolls of all shades. While a spokeswoman said the blond-haired, blue-eyed doll is the most popular, Barry said the racially diverse offerings across many brands have been selling well, giving manufacturers more confidence to do even more. You can see it, he said, in the success of Hasbro’s Baby Alive dolls. “A key driver of the success of that brand this year has been diversity and ethnicities,” he said. “Hasbro has always had the blue-eyed, blond-haired Baby Alive doll. In adding other ethnicities, they’ve seen demand for that line significantly increase. It’s definitely working.” Toys R Us also recently started carrying American Girl’s Truly Me collection in select stores — which includes dozens of dolls of all shades, eye colors and hairstyles, including one without hair and that come with accessories such as crutches, diabetes kits and wheelchairs. American Girl added another black character to its lineup of historical dolls this summer, a girl who grows up in civil rights-era Detroit. Earlier this year, Walmart also expanded the range of skin colors and hairstyles in its My Life As and My Sweet Love doll collections, including even adding an 18-inch boy doll, a first for a mass retailer, said spokeswoman Danit Marquardt. There also are two new Disney princesses this year, joining Elsa and Ariel. Products featuring Elena of Avalor, who is Latina, and Moana, a Hawaiian heroine, are a common site on shelves this holiday. Barbie, who set an unrealistic standard of beauty for generations of little girls, received a major makeover this year. Mattel, which had seen sales of its flagship brand faltering for years, hoped to make Barbie more relevant with a new Fashionistas line with dolls that come in with seven different skin tones, 22 eye colors and 24 hairstyles. She was also finally given more realistic body proportions and comes in three sizes — curvy, petite and tall. The changes have helped Barbie get her groove back with sales rising this year. “It’s doing extremely well,” said Jim Silver, editor of toy review site TTPM. “It’s one — if not the — hottest segment of Barbie.” He added that it’s meaningful that Mattel has refrained from labeling the new Barbies, but instead has given them a range of skin tones and eye colors. “As this country is forged in more mixed marriages and more different ethnic background getting married, you can’t label anymore,” he said. “Everybody looks different.” Anthonia Akitunde, editor-in-chief of Mater Mea, a website focused on women of color, remembers her excitement when American Girl introduced Addy Walker in 1990s, the brand’s first black character. Even though she couldn’t afford one, it was still a special moment for her. “I was excited to see someone with brown skin,” she said. “She had a gap (in her teeth) and I had a gap. There was something comforting in seeing a doll who on the surface level looks like me.” These days, she sees her Facebook news feed light up whenever there are new launches of other racially diverse dolls. She recalled the buzz, for example, about Naturally Perfect Dolls, which are primarily sold online and celebrate kinky and curly hair as an alternative to black dolls with straight hair. Stacey McBride-Irby has begun to see a cultural shift. She grew up playing with white Barbies, which inspired her to go to work at Mattel. She worked there for 15 years, designing a line of So In Style Barbies in 2009 with four different skin tones and fuller noses and lips compared to the previous black Barbies who were basically identical to the white versions. She left Mattel several years ago to start her own diverse line called Prettie Girls! dolls, which come with a South Asian, East Asian, Hispanic, African, African-American and white character. Walmart has started carrying it. In fact, she said, it was the nation’s largest retailer that approached her at a toy fair. “Consumers have been voicing their opinion, and fortunately the retailers and manufacturers are finally listening,” she said. “And consumers are finally purchasing the dolls they’re crying out for.” More Business articles »     RG Daily Digest Get our top headlines delivered to your inbox.         Today’s Business stories Real Estate Development Developer plans six-story luxury apartment building north of Ferry Street Bridge Business Federal court sidesteps port case 7:05 p.m. Business Sears to sell Craftsman tool brand to Stanley Black & Decker for $900 million Business Malls rethink anchor strategy Business Trump’s deportation vow spurs farmers to act Business Toyota stock dips after Trump tweet on Mexico plant Business Long-term mortgage rates fall after 9-week rise Business Starbucks hopes egg snacks will crack case on food sales Business Briefly Nation     Business Real Estate Development Developer plans six-story luxury apartment building north of Ferry Street Bridge A local developer wants to tear down a small commercial­ building near the north foot of the Ferry Street Bridge and construct what would be the tallest apartment building in Eugene north of the Willam­ette … Federal court sidesteps port case Sears to sell Craftsman tool brand to Stanley Black & Decker for $900 million Malls rethink anchor strategy More Business » Entertainment Music Success defined: Coming to terms with popularity wasn’t quick for Karla Bonoff The musician will be making a stop to play Wednesday at The Shedd with collaborator Nina Garber Success is a word that can mean different things.

The economy avoid going into a recession in part through the collective action of business, labour and communities working with government, though growth remained very modest. It was a year when al rating agencies were focussing on South Africa, with prospects of a downgrade that would have increased the cost of borrowing. By year-end, the country maintained its investment-grade rating. The Economic Development played a major role in ensuring a co-ordinated infrastructure investment programme and in expanding the levels of development finance in the economy, rallying stakeholder s around certain policy and programmes that will have major impact on our economy, as well as ensuring that government respond in an informed and more aligned manner across the three spheres to the challenges of the economy. A mid-term review of the New Growth Path jobs drivers was completed for Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Economic Development, which indicated that more than 2 million new jobs had been created in the period since the adoption of the NGP in 2010. Key highlights in the work of the Ministry included the innovative and extensive public interest conditions attached to a number of mergers including AB InBev’s takeover of SAB Miller, Coca-Cola and Edcon; the actions in the steel industry including the tough competition settlement with Arcelor Mittal and the reparation agreement with the seven largest construction companies; the expansion of investment by the Industrial Development Corporation and the agreement to co-invest in a new auto plant in Nelson Mandela Bay; and the increased investment in the National Infrastructure Plan, projected at R987 billion over the next three years. Economic transformation was a key theme in 2016 and we made significant strides in opening the economy to new black-owned companies and expanding levels of youth entrepreneurship. The Ministry of Economic Development is responsible for the work of the Economic Development Department (EDD), the International Trade Administration Commission (ITAC), the Competition Commission, the Competition Tribunal and the work of the Secretariat and Technical Unit of the Presidential infrastructure Coordinating Commission (PICC). Highlights of the work of the Ministry and its agencies are reported below.  Competition interventions and settlements During 2016, the Ministry of Economic Development concluded settlements with AB InBev, CCBA (Coca-Cola Bottling Africa), Edcon, Clicks, Arcelor Mittal and seven construction companies. These are major transactions that introduced either new public interest obligations on mergers, provided for funding for developmental projects or supported actions by the competition authorities against collusion in specific industries. In addition, the Ministry facilitated the introduction from 1 May this year (2016), of new criminalisation provisions against collusion and cartel conduct in the economy, with stiff jail sentences of up to 10 years. The competition interventions impact: a summary: R4,8 billion was committed by the companies listed above in development spending or penalties (excluding the value of the BEE commitments) R6 billion is the estimated value of the BEE-transactions 61 800 positive jobs impact: a total of 57 200 jobs were saved and an additional 4 600 jobs (minimum) will be created as a result of the transactions. More than 120 000 small spaza shops and taverns will be given the right to stock and display products from competitor brewers and soft-drink bottlers, opening the market for beverages in the boldest way yet in SA retail history Some of the key transactions and settlements concluded in 2016 included: AB InBev on the purchase of SAB Miller, which included among others, commitments to R1 billion that will be spent to promote new employment outside its core operations. The company will support small, emerging farmers with a R600 million facility through which  800 new farmers will be developed, with total employment gain of 2 600 workers and the remainder of the funding will support entrepreneurship and social programmes in South Africa -  turning SA from a net importer to a net exporter of beer inputs. It will retain the current  6 000 jobs of the workforce for a five year period and provide protection against retrenchment; open up competition by craft brewers through granting them access to 10% of fridge space in taverns; develop low-alcohol and no-alcohol choices for the SA market and commit to the location of the African headquarters in South Africa. Coca-Cola on the merger of three bottling operations, which included commitments to retain the current 7 500 jobs for a three year period and provide for protection against retrenchments for specified categories of staff; provide R800 million funding to create new jobs in its value-chains, of which a R400 million facility will support small, emerging farmers as well as packaging companies; and a further R400 million is available to support the opening of new spaza shops and retail outlets;  setting aside 20% of the equity in Appletiser for black South Africans and 20% equity in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa for black South Africans; opening up 10% of the fridge-space in coolers and display cabinets owned or financed by Coca-Cola in 117 000 spaza-shops and small retail outlets, to smaller and rival soft-drink bottlers; deepening the localisation of its local supply-chain including commitments to retain the production base of Appletiser in South Africa. The Edcon Group, with the conversion of debt to equity and transfer of ownership of the company to its creditors, which included commitments by Edcon to support the local clothing, footwear and textile industry, retain 43 630 current jobs in the company subject to market conditions and grow the number of new jobs in its retail and manufacturing operations by 2 000 workers. ArcelorMittal, which was fined R1,5 billion during 2016, required to commit to fresh capital spending of R4,6 billion to upgrade its plant and equipment in South Africa,  curb price increases through limiting its earnings before profit and tax to 10%, and limit retrenchments in its operations. Seven construction companies (Murray & Roberts, Aveng, WBHO, Group Five, Steffanutti Stocks, Raubex and Basil Read) committed to a new R1,5 billion reparation fund for developmental projects in addition to a R1,4 billion penalty for past collusion; and agreed to deep transformation through sale of equity or support for the development of black construction companies that will place many billions of rands in share-value or contracts in the hands of black South Africans and thus help to turn a new page of partnership between major players in the  industry found guilty of collusion on the one hand, and government and the society at large on the other. Details of the transformation plans have been publicly announced by three of the companies (Murray & Roberts, Aveng and WBHO). Clicks, which acquired the pharmacies of the Netcare Group, committed to protecting 207 jobs, work towards creating a further 65 additional employees, maintain or improve its levels of localisation and small business procurement and provide at least 80 bursaries to pharmacy students and 100 learnerships to young pharmacist assistants. The agreement with Walmart/Massmart to support localisation was relaunched during the year to expand its impact and resulted in a number of new localisation initiatives, including a local two-minute noodle maker, an environmental-friendly furniture-maker and a pump-filter manufacturer, being introduced into the company’s local supply-chain. Industrial development and funding The Industrial Development Corporation last year approved R14,5 billion in new investment, the largest sum in its 76-year history and 26% higher than the preceding year. Of particular note is the fact that this included R2,9 billion in transactions involving 54 black industrialists, so that we broaden participation in the economy. Roughly R1 billion was approved for youth-owned enterprises, showing that we are serious about implementing the Youth Employment Accord. A sum of R1,2 billion was made available to women-owned enterprises, which is an increase of 59% on the previous year, so that we tap the enterprise of women to help build the economy. The IDC is driving new investment and commitments to improve the competitiveness of South African companies, with its initiatives in the past financial year saving and creating 15 000 jobs. In addition to these outcomes, during 2016, the IDC partnered with the Beijing Automotive Industrial Corporation (BAIC) to set up a new R4,3 billion auto-plant in Nelson Mandela Bay that in the first phase will produce up to 50 000 vehicles for the domestic and African market, with planned employment of 2 500 workers during the construction phase and 800 permanent production workers in the plant. Infrastructure development The Ministry and Department provided the technical backbone for the work of the PICC during 2016. Some of the highlights of this work include the following: Supporting the expansion of new infrastructure projects and funding, which is expected to rise by more than R120 billion over the next three years, from R860 billion in the past MTEF to the new R987 billion announced by the Minister of Finance during the MTBPS in October 2016 Working with National Treasury to develop a financing instrument for all public infrastructure which will require fiscal support Technical work to support the development of a new multiyear budgeting and appropriations framework for infrastructure that would allow for better long-term planning, smoother phasing of construction works in a project and better value-for-money through infrastructure spending Identifying new sources of funding for infrastructure, including technical work on the approval of the $180 million loan by the BRICS New Development Bank for transmission lines for renewable energy plants Signing the Settlement Agreement with 7 construction companies on 11 October 2016 and facilitating the effectiveness of the Agreement on the 8th of November 2016 (see details above) Address to the Executive Council of NEDLAC on the National Infrastructure Plan and the need for stronger partnership between government, business and labour. Managed 20 meetings of the PICC structures. Trade development During 2016, the Ministry provided information to parliament on trade patterns on import and export performance of the SA economy. The analysis showed that exports to the rest of the continent is now the largest component of SA exports, and Africa overtook Asia, Europe and the Americas, as the largest export market for SA-made goods. The Ministry defended through the courts, the introduction of trade measures to address shortages of scrap metal for use in the local infrastructure build-programme; and supported ITAC’s work on tariff adjustments, including in the steel industry. The Ministry, concerned with rising food prices in the context of the drought, instructed ITAC to review the variable tariff formula in relation to wheat, maize and sugar. The reviews were concluded and recommendations have been submitted for Ministerial consideration. The Ministry also issued a trade directive to ITAC in relation to reciprocity for tariff support. The Trade Directive requires ITAC to consider the commitments companies make on investment, jobs and industrial output, when making its findings on tariff increases or rebates of duty. This was done to ensure that companies do not rely simply on tariff protection or rebates but invest heavily on new technologies, training of workers and product innovation to maintain and increase their market share. It is also to ensure that any costs to connected industries are at least accompanied by increases in jobs. The major highlights on the Ministry’s regulatory initiatives during 2016 included the following: Introduction of provisions of the Competition Amendment Act to criminalise collusive actions by company directors and officials, with up to ten year sentences in jail Issuing of a Trade Directive to ITAC to consider the commitments that recipients of trade relief make to address employment, investment and competitiveness concerns Request to ITAC to review the tariff formulae applicable to wheat, maize and sugar imports Other Ministerial Interventions During 2016 the Ministry and EDD-agencies focussed on measures to retain steel manufacturing in South Africa, evaluate the impact of measures to support the clothing, textile and footwear industry and grow the agro-processing and film-making industries A Steel Task-team developed a coordinated set of measures to address the impact of the global glut of steel on the local industry, the past collusive practices and the need to have a secure supply of steel. These included trade, competition and investment measures.  A Pricing Committee was also set up with representatives across the value-chain to monitor steel pricing and Arcelor Mittal’s adherence to a range of reciprocal commitments it made in relation to tariff support including increased investment, retention of jobs and pricing commitments. Ministerial-level site visits were undertaken to four companies in the clothing, textile and footwear industries (see below) to evaluate the impact of incentive measures on industrial performance. Competition measures in the beverages sector as well as support measures in soya helped to lay the basis for employment. Support by the Ministry and EDD-agencies for the development of the soya processing industry has yielded exceptional results. South Africa now has nine soya crushing plants, with a capacity to crush 1,8 million tons per year. This is roughly double the capacity that existed five years ago. South Africa has also increased the acreage under cultivation for soya-beans and has increased the export of soya oils and soya cake. During the year, 42 black farmers were identified for the planting of soya beans and by year-end, some 2005 hectares of land was being planted or considered for planting. In addition, EDD provided support for a ‘My-spaza Township Enterprise Development Project to introduce 42 wholesalers to 28 spaza shop operators to partner with them and provide funding for structural/ infrastructure upgrades of the spaza Economic Development Policy Co-ordination The Department supported the co-ordination of economic development policy initiatives across national departments through economic cluster work, Cabinet Committee systems and bilateral meetings with Departments. This work also extended to co-ordination across the spheres of government to integrate work at national, province and municipal levels. The Deputy Minister, together with a team in the Department, worked with provinces and municipalities to ensure seamless alignment with the national policies and programmes. In 2016 we managed to assist provinces to develop plans that are aligned to the National Development Plan through the 9-point plan framework announced in the State of the Nation Address. Further work is being done to link the plans to budget and other resources that can be leveraged from national initiatives. Building social partnership, supporting investment and addressing country-risk issues Activities in the development of social partnership and supporting investment, job creation and economic opportunities can be listed in six categories: Meetings with investors and business associations Meetings with ratings agencies Discussions with International Financial Institutions Meetings with organised labour Social dialogue with business and labour Meetings with communities A number of meetings were held with investors or business associations during 2016, including with companies such as Google, Coca-Cola, SAB Miller, Chevron, Sasol, Proctor & Gamble, Edcon and Arcelor Mittal and business associations such as the Atlantis Chamber of Business, CEOs at a meeting organised by the Johannesburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Black Business Council for the Built Environment and the Progressive Business Forum. The Ministry worked with the Minister of Finance on the South African narrative on investment and growth and met with three ratings agencies on country rating: Moody’s, Fitch and Standard & Poor and one ratings agency on the IDC rating (Fitch) as well as with business and organised labour on a common country position. The Ministry met with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on its Article 4 Consultations. Addresses to the national policy meetings of trade unions included to the Congresses of the Food & Allied Workers Union (FAWU), Southern African Clothing and Textile Workers' Union (SACTWU), United Association of SA (UASA), National Union of Leather and Allied Workers (NULAW), National Union of Metal Workers of South Africa (NUMSA) and to the Central Executive Committee of trade union federation COSATU. Discussions were held with workers at food, clothing and metal factories to obtain feedback on government’s industrial support programmes (see details below). The Ministry was part of the government team led by the Deputy President, which engaged with business and labour on the National Minimum Wage and labour market regulation during the year.  The Deputy Minister assisted the Mpumalanga TVET Council to develop a Partnership Framework that has seen two partnerships being agreed upon through the signing of a memorandum of understanding between Gert Sibande College and Sasol; and between Ehlanzeni TVET College and RCL foods. In the MOU they committed to building an ideal TVET College that will result in the building of skills relevant to the industrial development needs. Further work is progress with regard to Nkangala College and Eskom. Conclusion The Ministry looks forward to working closely together with social partners in 2017. We wish all South Africans a Merry Christmas and Prosperous New year. Thank you.

Witnesses told police that a car drove into the parking lot of Wal-Mart, 1002 N. Sheridan, around 2 p.m. and some people that came out of the store ended up in an altercation with people in the car. One of the shoppers punched someone in the car, said Lawton Police Sgt. Tim Jenkins, information officer. "Somebody inside the car shot some blank rounds off," Jenkins said.  People scattered and the car fled the parking lot before police arrived. Jenkins said there are no suspects and there were no victims  except for the frazzled nerves of late Christmas shoppers. He encouraged people to take it easy with one another and not let the spirit of the season turn to chagrin.  Read on the Daily Edition Section:  Local The Lawton Constitution 102 SW 3rd, Lawton, OK Classifieds: (580) 357-9545 Circulation: (580) 353-6397 Switchboard: (580) 353-0620 Site Links Home News Sports Styles e-Editions Classifieds Obituaries Contact Surf New Media
