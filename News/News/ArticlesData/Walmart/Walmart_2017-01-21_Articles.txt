Higher Education Elementary and Primary Education Forum Jim Guidry Commentaries Higher Education San Jacinto College News Release Friday, January 20, 2017 San Jacinto College selected as one of 12 community colleges to participate in national credentialing program for retail workers More than 1,200 workers expected to enroll in program PASADENA, Texas – The League for Innovation in the Community College has announced a $2.9 million grant from the Walmart Foundation to develop a three-part credentialing program for retail workers. San Jacinto College is one of 12 community colleges across the country selected to participate in the program, Brighter Futures 3.0, which will build on the success of the Western Association of Food Chains’ (WAFC) Retail Management Certificate (RMC).  Over the 2.5-year period of the grant, the selected colleges, based in urban, suburban and rural areas, will work with retail employers who are committed to the RMC as the credential for the advancement of their existing workforce. It is anticipated that more than 1,200 incumbent retail workers will be enrolled in the program, which seeks to break the RMC into three portable and stackable certificate programs, allowing workers a more flexible and manageable way to ultimately earn the full certificate. The League for Innovation and the WAFC will disseminate the best practices from the project to other community colleges throughout the country. In announcing the grants, League President and CEO Dr. Rufus Glasper expressed confidence that the Walmart Brighter Futures project will have a positive impact beyond the selected colleges. “The Walmart Brighter Futures 3.0 project will lead to best practices that will expand the capacity of community colleges to enhance job training opportunities for incumbent workers.  The League will be delighted to share the work of the participating colleges with colleges around the country,” said Glasper.  The project aims to scale the retail management certificate that is currently offered at more than 150 community colleges in cooperation with the Western Association of Food Chains.  Participating colleges will offer the credit certificate to incumbent workers at local and regional retail employers.  In addition to San Jacinto College, nine other community colleges have been funded for the training program, and two more are expected to be named in the future. The other nine colleges are: Alexandria Technical and Community College (Minnesota) Anne Arundel Community College (Maryland) Austin Community College (Texas) College of Lake County (Illinois) Nashville State Community College (Tennessee) Moraine Valley Community College (Illinois) Sinclair Community College (Ohio) Umpqua Community College (Oregon) Wayne County Community College District (Michigan) The selected community colleges will receive up to $100,000 over the duration of the grant to support the colleges’ plans to provide services for retail employees. Additionally, the colleges will leverage instructional stipends to support participant enrollment in courses leading to the retail management certificate.  “We are excited to be selected to participate in this project,” said Dr. Brenda Hellyer, San Jacinto College Chancellor. “We recognize and appreciate the generosity of the Walmart Foundation and the leadership of the League for Innovation in making this work possible. We look forward to working with our national partners and our local retail employers to offer a nationally-recognized credential to retail employees right here in our community.” “We understand the long-term potential of credentialing to accelerate upward mobility of frontline retail workers, by helping retail workers demonstrate the skills they have gained to their current and prospective employers, while at the same time making it easier for employers to identify workers who have the skills they need,” said Kathleen McLaughlin, president of the Walmart Foundation and chief sustainability officer for Walmart. “We know that this work is important for the retail industry at large and that’s why we’re supporting the League’s efforts to make this credential more accessible to thousands of retail workers seeking to gain new skills and grow in their careers.” About the League for Innovation in the Community College The League for Innovation in the Community College (League) is an international nonprofit organization with a mission to cultivate innovation in the community college environment.

(Reuters) Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s plans were under way Friday to cut nearly 1,000 corporate jobs.  Continue Reading Below The layoffs, which occurred in midday closed-door meetings in Bentonville, Ark., affected employees involved with the retailer's supply chain, known as "replenishment," a person familiar with the situation said. They are expected to continue through the end of the month, executives familiar with the process said, as workers in human resources, technology and e-commerce are cut.  The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that Wal-Mart planned to trim its workforce by Jan. 31, the end of its fiscal year.  Last Friday, the retailer said several top executives would leave the company and it would reshuffle responsibility for others to focus on both store and e-commerce operations.  "To fuel our growth and our investments we have to manage our costs," its chief executive, Doug McMillon, wrote in a memo to staff reviewed by the Journal last Friday. "From time to time, you'll see the company eliminate positions in an effort to stay lean and fast."  Wal-Mart's cuts Friday come as the U.S.'s largest private employer, along with much of corporate America, is navigating a difficult balancing act: working to follow through on investor promises to create leaner operations while placating Mr. Trump's new administration by highlighting U.S. job growth.  Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Several major companies, including General Motors Co. and Amazon.com Inc., have touted the creation of thousands of new jobs since Mr. Trump was elected, though many of those openings already were in the works.  Wal-Mart has planned to both add and cut jobs this year. Days after the Journal reported on the company's layoff plans, Wal-Mart said it would create 10,000 new U.S. jobs this year.  Although those positions stem mostly from existing efforts to open and remodel stores and represent less than 1% of its U.S. workforce, the announcement elicited a "thank you" tweet from Mr. Trump.  For much of the last two years, Wal-Mart executives have emphasized the company's commitment to lowering operating costs. Mr. McMillon has repeatedly told investors the company is willing to pare its workforce and stores when necessary to invest in boosting e-commerce sales and improving existing stores, areas he believes will provide growth in the future.  Since early 2016, Wal-Mart has cut more than 18,000 U.S. jobs through closing stores, trimming staffing at some locations and cutting jobs at its headquarters.  It is also working to stay connected to the new administration. In December, Mr. Trump's transition team said Mr. McMillon would be part of his "strategic and policy forum," along with over a dozen other CEOs.  What do you think?

From Wal-Mart to General Motors to Amazon, a growing number of the world's largest companies appear to be trying to get in step with President Donald Trump's demand that employers hire and keep jobs at home. By JOSH BOAK, Associated Press Published: January 20, 2017, 4:12 PM A   A WASHINGTON — From Wal-Mart to General Motors to Amazon, a growing number of the world’s largest companies appear to be trying to get in step with President Donald Trump’s demand that employers hire and keep jobs at home. Trump, in response, has taken to Twitter to signal his approval. “Thank you to General Motors and Walmart for starting the big jobs push back into the U.S.!” he tweeted Tuesday afternoon. Yet it’s unclear just how many jobs are actually being saved or created as a result of Trump’s push or whether his administration will hold companies accountable for their pledges. In a solid job market with just 4.7 percent unemployment, hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs are added all the time for a broad range of reasons. Trump has boasted that he deserves the credit based on what chief executives have told him, despite evidence to the contrary provided by those same companies. “Ask top CEO’s of those companies for real facts. Came back because of me!” the then-president-elect declared on Twitter on Wednesday. GM announced Tuesday that it was creating or keeping 7,000 jobs, while Wal-Mart said it planned to hire 10,000 and support an additional 24,000 construction jobs with store openings and expansions. Those announcements followed Amazon’s commitment to add 100,000 workers through mid-2018 and a bold claim by the Chinese online retailer Alibaba that it would create 1 million U.S. jobs over the next five years. That extravagant pledge would make Alibaba alone responsible for over 10 percent of all jobs added each year — an unheard-of feat in the modern economy. Many economists say the hiring being celebrated by Trump reflects, more than anything, the health of the $18.7 trillion economy he is inheriting. “Between the election and today, unless you work on Capitol Hill in D.C., nothing fundamental has changed in the U.S. labor market,” said Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at the jobs site Glassdoor. To these economists, the latest high-profile hiring announcements suggest that companies are capitalizing on the politically charged climate. Trump has berated companies such as Nabisco for shuttering domestic plants in order to open factories in Mexico, while celebrating companies that publicly commit to hiring in the United States. What’s more, nearly every major U.S. employer has tax and regulatory issues before the government. To that end, a sympathetic ear in the White House could be helpful. ‘Opportunism’ The heads of German chemical company Bayer and seed-and-herbicide-maker Monsanto met with Trump last week to pitch the benefits of a planned-for merger of the two companies that requires antitrust clearance. And Trump proudly tweeted reports Wednesday that Bayer would add U.S. jobs. By announcing new jobs, companies can use any existing hiring plans to ingratiate themselves with Trump by hitching their plans to his economic agenda, noted Patrick O’Keefe, director of economic research at the consultancy and accountant CohnReznick. “There is a degree of opportunism — in a positive way,” O’Keefe said. GM plans to invest $1 billion in its U.S. factories and to create or keep 7,000 jobs — moves that the company had said were being planned well before the election. Trump had drawn attention to GM this month by threatening on Twitter to tax the automaker for selling Mexican-built cars in the United States. That set up GM’s jobs announcement as a coup for Trump, even though the investment was already in the works. A GM spokesman said it was “good timing for us to share what we are doing.” Wal-Mart’s hiring similarly seems somewhat independent of Trump. The jobs stem largely from plans to open and remodel stores — work that would not be outsourced overseas. Wal-Mart is the nation’s largest private employer, with 1.5 million workers in the United States, and its hiring rate this year will be similar to prior years, said Lorenzo Lopez, a company spokesman. These announcements follow hiring plans announced by Ford and Fiat Chrysler, among others. The auto executives were willing to let Trump promote their hiring plans, even though their decisions involved other market forces, including increased demand for SUVs as gasoline prices have dropped. Market matters Hyundai said Tuesday that it plans to invest $3.1 billion by 2021 on research and development at its factories in Alabama and Georgia. Chung Jin Haeng, chief executive of the South Korean automaker, said the decision had little to do with Trump. “The U.S. market is strategically important,” he said. At the same time, Trump has also talked with companies about cutting their costs — a move that often involves slashing jobs. He met Tuesday, for example, with the CEO of Boeing, a company he had criticized in December over Twitter for the “out of control” price of two new planes for the Air Force One fleet. CEO Dennis Muilenburg said he chatted with Trump about how to lower the costs for the presidential planes as well as fighter aircraft. “I think Mr. Trump is doing a great job with engaging the business,” Muilenburg said afterward. “We’re all on the same page here.” Not all the job announcements will necessarily come to fruition. Alibaba has said it expects to add a million U.S. companies to its online retail platform in the next five years. It asserted that sales to Chinese consumers would lead each of those companies to add, on average, one job each. This would translate into an astounding 250,000 a jobs a year in an economy in which every employer, combined, added 2.2 million jobs in 2016. “It’s not rocket-science math,” said company spokesman Brion Tingler, who nevertheless cautioned that the 1 million jobs being publicized were an “aspiration.” Other than his social media megaphone, Trump doesn’t appear to have the means to hold companies accountable for their jobs pledges. His transition team didn’t respond to questions about how it planned to ensure that CEOs’ promises to create U.S. jobs were fulfilled.

(REUTERS/Rebecca Cook)    4443001 Video footage taken from a Florida Wal-Mart shows a shopper literally jumping the gun. The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Tuesday, March 29, 2011 - 02:04 Mar 29 - Wal-Mart Stores went before the Supreme Court on Tuesday to argue that the court should halt a class action sex-discrimination lawsuit brought by female employees. Jon Decker reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments Tuesday in a case that could affect more than a million Wal-Mart employees, and could end up being the largest class-action sex-discrimination lawsuit ever. At issue is whether women were systematically paid less than male employees and denied promotions that went to men. Betty Dukes is a Wal-Mart employee in California and a lead plaintiff in the case. (SOUNDBITE) (English) BETTY DUKES, LEAD PLAINTIFF AND WAL-MART EMPLOYEE, SAYING : "I brought this case, because I believe that there was a pattern of discrimination at Wal-Mart, not just in my store, but I believe it is across the country. Since we have filed our lawsuits in 2001, I have heard from numerous women, telling me basically the same story as mine of disparitive treatment and lack of promotion as well as lack of pay." The justices will decide whether a small group of women can represent a huge nationwide class that may include millions of current and former employees - who accuse the world's largest retailer of discrimination. Gisel Ruiz is executive vice-president for Wal-Mart. (SOUNDBITE) (English) GISEL RUIZ, EXECUTIVE VICE-PRESIDENT FOR WALMART SAYING : "We've always had processes in place. We've had strong policies against discrimination in place, long before the lawsuit was filed. I remember learning about these policies when I joined the company and as I grew up with the company, then it became my responsibility to teach them forward. When we hear issues coming from our associates, we take action immediately. There are consequences for people who violate those policies." An eventual Supreme Court ruling, expected by late June, is likely to uphold or undo the class certification, a decision that could determine whether the lawsuit proceeds to trial. Wal-Mart, which last year recorded $14 billion in profits, has been fighting the lawsuit for over a decade. Jon Decker, Reuters.

January 20, 2017 City Mother of Accused Walmart Murderer Requests Guardianship, Power to Make Legal Decisions By Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs | January 20, 2017 LikeTweet EmailPrint More More on City Subscribe to City Follow this author The mother of the Ithaca man accused of fatally shooting a UPS driver in the Ithaca Walmart parking lot requested on Friday the power to make legal decisions for her son and to become his legal guardian. In a sworn petition filed in Tompkins County Supreme Court on Friday morning, Linda Edwards said she is the mother of Justin R. Barkley, 38, of Ithaca, and asked the court to let her make decisions in legal matters he is currently facing, handle his medical needs and manage his financial assets. Police say Barkley fatally shot William Schumacher, 52, of Candor, in the chest with a rifle on Dec. 8 before driving over the victim in a truck and fleeing to his residence on Dryden Road, beginning an eight-hour standoff with authorities until he ultimately surrendered.

Barkley “is unable to take care of his needs both health, mental, legal and financial affairs,” Edwards wrote, because two psychiatric examiners determined that he was unable to understand the court proceedings against him and assist in his own defense. “In discussions with [Barkley], he is unable to understand the nature of the situation or the actual facts/matters that had taken place,” Edwards wrote. “He is also totally unable to speak realistically, accurately or coherently about the situation which he faces.” Leaderboard 2 <a href="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=d282f4125a&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538220188&cs=d282f4125a&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> Edwards requested guardianship of Barkley for an indefinite period of time, no less than a year. Parental guardianship of a child ends on the child’s 18th birthday in New York. Reached by phone Friday evening, Edwards said she had no comment on her request for guardianship. Attorney James Baker, who is representing Barkley in his criminal case, also declined to comment. District Attorney Matthew Van Houten told The Sun that he still expects Barkley to be deemed competent when he is evaluated more thoroughly by different psychiatric examiners. Van Houten also said Edwards’ petition will not affect the criminal case in any way and that she should not be able to make legal decisions for Barkley, regardless of whether he is competent or not. “If [Edwards] is looking to have an influence on the criminal case — in other words, put herself in Mr. Barkley’s shoes — that’s not how it works,” he said. “If [Barkley] is not competent to make a decision or to participate in his own defense, there’s a process for that. It’s not letting someone else make decisions for him or to step into his shoes. Van Houten said Barkley “is able to understand what’s happening and make decisions, he just doesn’t want to,” and added that he expects Barkley to oppose his mother’s petition, the outcome of which will be determined by a Tompkins County Supreme Court judge. Edwards, in her petition, said she is suitable to act as Barkley’s guardian because she “has been his mother and intimately involved in his life. Of all of the available and willing people to carry out this function, she is the most familiar with his needs and assets.” Barkley’s truck is impounded and he may owe money on a motorcycle, Edwards wrote. She is requesting the authority to manage his financial assets, and said that he has more than $2,500 in his bank account, although she does not know the exact figure. Syracuse attorney Michael Harris, who is representing Edwards in her petition, could not immediately be reached for comment Friday evening.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint Cargill Inc., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and two dozen more of the biggest players in food this week committed to keeping closer track of the supply chain in an effort to eliminate deforestation, especially in South America’s Amazon region. The companies — like chocolate-maker Mars, European big-box retailer Carrefour and agribusiness giant Bunge — announced the partnership Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Over the years, many global businesses have cleared large swaths of the rain forest to fill global demand for food and resources. According to nonprofit World Resources Institute, agriculture is responsible for 70 percent of all tropical deforestation. Many international corporations now recognize that cutting down trees for farmland is not sustainable for the environment or businesses. Consumers increasingly expect to know where their products come from and the process through which they were made. This agreement marks the next step for Wayzata-based Cargill in reducing the impact of its agriculture operations on the forests. Cargill already uses a technology, developed by Global Forest Watch, that assesses deforestation risk in their palm oil, soy and cocoa supply chains. This new alliance expands on that platform by allowing banks and companies to monitor the deforestation risks, through satellite imagery and real-time alerts, much like they track commodities. Cargill’s Chief Executive David MacLennan this week said in a column for the Huffington Post that “protecting forests is clearly the right thing to do.” Coinciding with the Swiss summit, the company also published this week its first progress report on the goal of eliminating deforestation practices by 2030. “On a recent trip to Brazil, we flew over the Amazon,” MacLennan wrote. “Looking out the plane window, I saw an ocean of trees blanketing the ground below. But I also saw large patches of land that had been deforested to make way for farmland. And as much as I like to see farmland, since our business depends on sourcing crops from farmers worldwide, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t feel a real sense of loss. ... Cargill knows preserving forests is imperative.” This new online data center is designed to give more insight and information to companies trying to change their practices. Globally, 366 companies worth $2.9 trillion have committed to eliminating deforestation from their supply chains.   kristen.painter@startribune.com 612.673.4767 KristenPainter View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

(View our Privacy Policy) Tampa slaying victim was on road to recovery, spent life helping others Anastasia Dawson, Times Staff Writer Link View all Articles ANASTASIA DAWSONTampa Bay Times Friday, January 20, 2017 7:01pm Print 0 My Edition I want to see more articles tagged I'm already following articles tagged Previous Next Previous Next TAMPA — It was a cool, breezy night Jan. 14, so William "Bill" Denham decided he would take a walk down the familiar tree-covered streets of his Old Seminole Heights neighborhood. Related News/Archive Brandon man arrested in slaying of victim found at Tampa gas station 1 Month Ago Airport shooting suspect spent two quiet years in Alaska, but his life was falling apart 2 Weeks Ago Tampa police: Fugitive wanted in slaying of nurse captured in Louisiana 1 Month Ago He walked alone to a nearby Walmart and bought a few frozen dinners, stopped by his old house on E Paris Street, then headed toward the small, white wood-framed house on E Crenshaw Street he bought in November with Dan Kane, his partner of 30 years. He never made it there. On the way, sometime after 10 p.m., the 53-year-old Denham was punched and beaten to death by two men and a woman at the intersection of N 15th and E Elm streets, police said. Just blocks away, Kane was at his home on Hilton Place, preparing to move in with Denham. "I've always felt safe in that neighborhood and have walked down those streets myself, but now it's very scary to know something like this happened when he was just walking home," said Kane. A passing motorist called Tampa police to report that a man had been left unconscious in the road with no identification, his Walmart bags at his side, Kane said. It was about 2:30 a.m. when police finally identified Denham and knocked on Kane's door. "His whole life was helping other people," Kane said. "He didn't deserve this." Denham was light-hearted and kind, a prankster with a great memory who loved Boston Kremes at Dunkin' Donuts and his two chihuahuas, Ava and Paco. In the late 1980s, he left his three sisters and mother in Pennsauken, N.J., and moved to Florida with Kane and his best friend since seventh grade, John Layer. With a degree in social work from the University of South Florida, Denham spent most of his life working as a counselor at agencies including the Tampa AIDS Network and DACCO, as well as local methadone clinics. But the work was stressful and Denham burned out, Layer said. He made money flipping houses and waiting tables, recently on an overnight shift at Three Coins Diner on Nebraska Avenue. His struggle with addiction led to a string of arrests in Hillsborough County, but he found success in faith-based recovery programs and was a devout Christian. The Friday before he died, Denham said he wanted to return to social work and asked for help updating his resume, Kane said. "He was such a ray of sunshine, and would call me up to talk about spiritual matters and what the Bible has to say about life and his love for life and the Lord," Denham said. "I'll really miss that." Tampa police said they are still searching for the three assailants, who were seen walking south on N 15th Street after the attack. Witnesses described them as white or Hispanic. One man was in a black short-sleeve shirt, appeared to be in his 20s, and was just under 6 feet tall with a stocky build and brown, scruffy facial hair. The woman had long black hair, witnesses said. Crime Stoppers of Tampa Bay is offering a reward of up to $3,000 for information that leads to arrests; call 1-800-873-TIPS (8477), report anonymously at crimestopperstb.com or use the P3 Tips mobile app. Contact Anastasia Dawson at adawson@tampabay.com or (813) 226-3377.

AutoZone operates seven stores in Hamilton County, two in Cleveland, two in Dalton, Ga., and others in Ringgold, Ga., Fort Oglethorpe, Athens, Tenn., Etowah, Tenn., and Pikeville, Tenn. The retailer said most of the new hiring will be at stores in Atlanta, Dallas, Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio, New York City, New Orleans, Pittsburg and Oakland, Calif. AutoZone is the latest U.S. business to tout its hiring plans as Donald Trump becomes president. Trump has praised General Motors, Ford, Carrier, Wal-Mart and other businesses that also have announced expansion or hiring plans in the past month. AutoZone said it will be hiring sales representatives, delivery drivers, parts sales managers, commercial sales managers, store managers and hub specialists. Applications must be submitted online at the AutoZone careers site, www.autozone.com/careers. AutoZone said it has hired more than 10,000 current and former U. S. Military Service members since 2015 and has a goal of hiring more than 15,000 additional transitioning service members and military veterans by 2020. Boeing workers vote on Charleston union The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) filed petition Friday with the National Labor Relations Board to hold a union election for approximately 2,850 production employees at the Boeing Co. in North Charleston, S.C. The filing comes after the IAM postponed a scheduled April 22, 2015, union election amid political criticism of organized labor at the plant. "Boeing workers just want to be treated with the respect they deserve," said IAM Boeing SC Lead Organizer Mike Evans. "Why should they be subject to a different set of standards and rules than folks building the exact same plane in Seattle?" Evans said "it was impossible to hold a free and fair election" in 2015, but he thinks the union is now ready for a union certification election. Workers have remained in contact with IAM organizers in recent months regarding numerous workplace concerns that remain unaddressed, including subjective raises, inconsistent scheduling policies and a lack of respect on the shop floor, Evans said. The NLRB is expected to issue election dates and locations in the coming weeks. The IAM already represents more than 35,000 Boeing employees at 24 locations nationwide. China's growth slows as trade war looms BEIJING — China's economic growth sank to a three-decade low in 2016 as its struggling exporters brace for a possible trade battle with President-elect Donald Trump. Growth in the quarter ending in December ticked up to 6.8 percent over 2015, supported by government spending and a real estate boom, a gain from the previous quarter's 6.7 percent, government data showed Friday. Still, for the full year, growth came in at a lackluster 6.7 percent, down from 6.9 percent in 2015 and the weakest since 1990's 3.9 percent. That temporary upturn is unlikely to last, economists said. 'Net neutrality' foe named to head FCC President Donald Trump has reportedly picked a fierce critic of the Obama-era "net neutrality" rules to be chief regulator of the nation's airwaves and internet connections. Citing unidentified people, Bloomberg and Politico both reported Friday that the next chairman of the Federal Communications Commission will be Ajit Pai, an old hand at the agency. Pai's chief of staff, Matthew Berry, declined to comment. FCC spokesmen did not immediately reply to emails. Pai is one of the two Republican commissioners on a five-member panel that regulates the country's communications infrastructure, including TV, phone and internet service. Las Vegas Sands pays to end probe Las Vegas Sands Corp. will pay almost $7 million to U.S. authorities to end a more than five-year corrupt practices investigation, company and federal officials said Thursday. With the agreement, the company resolved twin probes over more than $60 million paid to an unnamed agent retained in 2006 to acquire a Chinese basketball team, plus other business dealings that include a Beijing real estate deal to promote casinos on the Cotai Strip of Macao. The company wasn't charged with a crime and did not admit guilt in either case. Apple depicts Qualcomm as a shady monopolist SAN FRANCISCO — Apple is suing mobile chip maker Qualcomm for $1 billion in a patent fight pitting the iPhone maker against one of its major suppliers. The complaint filed Friday in a San Diego federal court depicts Qualcomm as a monopolist abusing its power in a key segment of the mobile chip market to extort royalties for iPhone innovations that have nothing to do with Qualcomm's technology. Apple says it has been cooperating with government regulators who have been investigating Qualcomm's business practices, prompting Qualcomm to retaliate by withholding about $1 billion in scheduled payments. Mars Skittles to be used for cattle feed Mars Inc. says it doesn't know why Skittles found on a rural Wisconsin highway might have been headed to become cattle feed. The case began when a Wisconsin sheriff posted on Facebook this week that "hundreds of thousands of Skittles" had been found spilled on a highway. Later, he updated the post to say the candy had fallen off a truck on its way to be cattle feed. A variety of food byproducts are commonly used for animal feed, and Skittles maker Mars says it has procedures for discarding foods for that purpose. However, the company said the Skittles in question came from a factory that doesn't sell unused products for animal feed. AT&T adds 200,000 DirectTV subscribers AT&T beat analysts' expectations and signed up new pay-TV customers for the first time in seven quarters with its new online video streaming service, DirecTV Now. The streaming service offers a lineup that's similar to cable TV but doesn't require a cable box, satellite dish or annual contract. The Dallas-based company reported that at least 200,000 video subscribers signed up in the fourth quarter, according to a Friday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Analysts were expecting 61,000, according to a Bloomberg report. AT&T launched the new service in late November and pushed a promotional offer for early subscribers of $35 a month for 100-plus channels. That same channel lineup is now $60 a month. AT&T is the largest pay-TV provider in the U.S. with more than 25 million subscribers but it faces a more competitive and fragmented TV landscape. Cable and satellite subscribers are on the decline. The company must fend off new rivals like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu. AT&T's answer is its own video streaming service: DirecTV Now. The streaming service includes a more traditional cable lineup but is missing the CBS network and features such as DVR. Customers must pay extra for premium channels, HBO and Cinemax.

I'm also proud to say near and not in, because I don't like actually living in any town, no matter what the size. I consider my home town a pretty decent sized place. We have two stop lights, four or five policemen to give you a ticket if you run one of them, accidentally, of course, and have our own movie theater. I won't say we have a small town because some city fathers trying to lure Walmart or something to town might be offended. I won't say we have a big town because, well, it just isn't. I'm proud of my small town as are those who live in places like this across the country. Those of us who live in places like Brush, Limon, Nucla, Haxtun, Montecello, Kemmerer and others have an odd way of showing how much we love our small town. We tell small town jokes. In fact, we find ourselves competing with others when telling stories about who has the smallest town. It often becomes a case of the first liar not having a chance. I have a sort of mental collection of "small town" lies (or maybe they are true, in some cases). "I once lived in a town so small both city limit signs were on the same post" is one of my favorites. "Our town was so small we had to take turns being the town drunk" is another favorite. Advertisement "Our town will always be small because it seems like whenever a baby is born, someone leaves town!" "Our town is so small, for fun we all go downtown on Saturday night and watch a haircut." "A big night in our small town is when we all go downtown to the bakery and smell the bread." Other highlights were when they built the interstate through our area; we'd all go down and watch the concrete harden. Our small towns know how to throw a party, too. You haven't lived until you've eaten potato burritos sold by the Catholic women's group during Crowley County Days in Ordway, Colorado. The Christmas tree lighting Thanksgiving night in Rupert, Idaho, is more fun than anything any big impersonal city has to offer. The rodeo in Trinidad, Colorado or Pine Bluff, Wyoming, might be considered by some to be "small town", but the fun is big and the hearts of the people even bigger. Speaking of Rodeos, how about Brush, Colorado "World's Largest Open Rodeo" or whatever they call it now. They feed everyone who attends the first night. Let's see them try that at the National Western Stock Show in Denver. Give me watermelon days at Arkansas Valley Fair over Cannes Film Festival any day. Keep your vacation on the Riviera, I'll hit the sheep dog trials at Meeker, Colorado. In a small town, we all feel a part of the activities. We don't have to pay someone to create our fun. Like someone told me once, "Most places you have to pay someone to provide good fun for you." Here in our town we're all good for nothing!

Mary Sullivan Harrison County Sheriff’s Office 1 of 11 i By Justin Vicory jvicory@sunherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story The Harrison County Sheriff’s Office is seeking public assistance with the capture of four people who allegedly used credit card skimmers at a gas station and used the stolen information to purchase merchandise. The Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday recovered four credit card skimmers from the gas pumps at Robinwood One Stop on U.S. 49 at West Wortham Road in Saucier. The skimmers have been siphoning motorists’ personal identifying information while they pumped their gas. Video surveillance shows the same two men and two women at the gas station on three consecutive days before the skimmers were found, the Sheriff’s Office said. On Thursday, a Wal-Mart surveillance video also captured the same four suspects at the Wal-Mart on U.S. 49 in Gulfport. The Sheriff’s Office said the suspects used multiple fabricated cards with stolen numbers to purchase merchandise. They also used a stolen card number on the same day at the Walgreens on U.S. 49 in Gulfport. The suspects were traveling in a 2017 silver Ford Expedition. One of the male suspects has a large tattoo on his upper left arm and a tattoo on the right side of his neck. The other male is bald with a slim build. Both female suspects have long brown hair. One is pregnant and the other has a slim build. Sheriff Troy Peterson has warned customers who bought gas at the One Stop to check their credit card statements. The Sheriff’s Office is asking anyone with information to call 228-896-3000.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. The flag-draped casket of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton is carried to the hearse during her funeral in Orlando at the First Baptist Church on January 14, 2017. Story highlights Four officers have been killed the first three weeks of the year At least 64 law enforcement officers were shot and killed in 2016 (CNN)Four police officers have been killed in the line of duty this year, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. Last year, 64 officers died in the line of duty. The decade's highest total came in 2011, with 73 officers killed. Here's a look at the officers who have been killed as of January 20, 2017: FLORIDA MASTER SGT. (OFFICER) DEBRA CLAYTON Read More Master Sgt. Debra Clayton Clayton, 42, was shot and killed when she tried to confront a murder suspect in the parking lot of a local Walmart in Florida on January 9. When police arrived on the scene they found the 17-year veteran dead from gunshot wounds. Officers could not revive her after performing CPR. The Orange County Sheriff's Office launched a manhunt that eventually led to the capture of Clayton's suspected shooter -- Markeith Loyd. Markeith Loyd: Suspect in cop killing captured, Orlando police say Loyd had been on the run from authorities for nearly a month. He was wanted in connection to the fatal shooting of Sade Dixon, 24, his pregnant ex- girlfriend outside her home in the Pine Hills neighborhood on December 13, 2016, CNN affiliate WFTV reported. Loyd, 41, has been charged with two counts of murder in the deaths of Dixon and Clayton, said Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings. He also faces charges of attempted murder and aggravated assault for injuries Dixon's family member sustained in the alleged encounter. Clayton's death marks the first fatal shooting of a police officer in the US this year, according to the memorial fund. Clayton was married and the mother of a college-age son. She was promoted posthumously to lieutenant at her funeral. DEPUTY OFFICER NORMAN LEWIS Deputy First Class Norman Lewis Lewis, a deputy first class with the Orange County Sheriff's Office, was killed in a vehicle accident while searching for Clayton's gunman. Lewis, 34, was driving a motorcycle when another vehicle turned in front of him. He died in the crash a couple hours after Clayton was shot. The 11-year veteran in the sheriff's department, mostly worked in the traffic division. The University of Central Florida graduate played in the offensive line on the school's football team from 2000-2003 and earned his degree in criminal justice in 2004, CNN affiliate WFTV reported. NORTH DAKOTA DEPUTY SHERIFF COLT ALLERY Allery, 29, of the Rolette County Sheriff's Office, was fatally shot during a pursuit of a stolen vehicle on Wednesday. The suspect was killed and another officer was wounded in the incident, according to the memorial fund. Allery is the first officer killed in North Dakota this year, the fund said. TEXAS DETECTIVE JERRY WALKER Little Elm Police Detective Jerry Walker was a father of four. Walker, 48, was shot and killed while responding to a 911 call about an armed man outside a home in the Dallas suburb of Little Elm on Tuesday. A standoff ensued. The suspect opened fire from inside the home striking Walker. The suspect was found dead in the home hours later. Walker was transported by helicopter to a local hospital where he later died from his injuries, police said. Walker leaves behind a wife and four children, the youngest just a few months old. The oldest is 22 years old. CNN's Emanuella Grinberg, David Shortell and Ralph Ellis contributed to this report. Content by LendingTree Rates now at 3.2% APR (15 Yr Fixed). Do you qualify?

View Larger  (WFTV) By Cox Media Group ORLANDO, Fl — The Orlando Police Department released helicopter video Thursday of the take down of Markeith Loyd, who is accused of shooting and killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend before gunning down Lt. Debra Clayton in a Walmart parking lot. >> Read more trending stories  Loyd was arrested Tuesday night at an abandoned home in the Carver Shores area following a nine-day manhunt.  The video was released the same day that Loyd appeared in court on murder charges in connection with the death of Sade Dixon, who police said Loyd shot and killed outside her home on Dec. 13.  Loyd became verbally aggressive with the judge in court Thursday as she read the charges against him and explained his options. When Loyd was taken to Orlando police headquarters after his arrest, his face was bloody and bruised and he yelled, “They beat me up” at WFTV’s cameras. Police said Loyd came out of the house Tuesday night armed and wearing tactical gear, but dropped his weapons. Orlando Police Department Chief John Mina spoke at a press conference Thursday, to give more details about not only the arrest of Loyd, but of Clayton’s death.  Mina said Thursday that Loyd did not comply with orders to put his hands behind his back so force was used. He added that Loyd could have had something under the tactical gear, and that officers later found ammunition on Loyd.  [View the story "Police release helicopter video showing take down of Markeith Loyd" on Storify] There are no comments yet.

The Android-based streaming device allows Sling customers to add local broadcast stations into their guide using an external antenna. (STEVE MARCUS / Reuters Photo) Jennifer Van GroveContact Reporter When it comes to television viewing, what’s old is new again as an increasing number of Americans are dumping their cable boxes and going totally retro. That’s right, the tried-and-true TV antenna — just digitally enhanced and minus the goofy bunny ears — is having a moment in the spotlight as people search for cheaper replacements for their cable and satellite TV packages. In fact, since 2013, the percentage of broadband households in the nation using only antennas to watch linear TV has jumped from 9 percent to 15 percent, according to data released this week by Parks Associates. “That's a significant increase and a steady trend upward,” said Brett Sappington, senior director of research at Parks Associate who tracks trends in TV viewing. “There is a bit of a renaissance for the antenna. For many years, the trend in the U.S. was in the rise of pay TV as a primary entertainment option for consumers. But, if you look worldwide, over-the-air broadcasts are by far the dominate way people watch TV channels.” And, really, the resurgence in antenna usage in the U.S. isn’t all that surprising. What with some cable and Internet packages climbing well past $250-per-month, a consumer push back was seemingly inevitable. It certainly doesn’t hurt that all you need is a digital antenna for live access to over-the-air, HD broadcasts on the local stations we all know: ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX, PBS and the CW. Plus, you can find several affordable antenna options at your neighborhood Walmart, and plenty more on Amazon. Better still, once you have said antenna, those broadcast channels are all free. Yes, reception, obviously, varies based on your location, but a handy tool from the Federal Communications Commission makes it easy to gauge what stations have the strongest signals in your neighborhood. The antenna’s comeback can be directly linked to the increasing cost of traditional pay TV packages, Sappington said. At the end of 2016, American households, he said, were paying, on average, $84 a month just for cable or satellite TV. “Data consistently shows that the perceived (lack of) value of pay TV is always the No. 1 reason why people cut the cord,” Sappington said. “They say, ‘My pay TV was not worth what I was paying, and so I canceled.’” Truth be told, the households embracing antennas probably never watched the broadcast networks all that much to begin with.   “My impression is that the vast majority of people using antennas are doing it because they've bought into some … streaming service and don't want to watch that much broadcast TV,” said Paul Verna, an Internet TV analyst with eMarketer. Verna theorizes that these renaissance viewers are really just turning to antennas as a fall back in case of a network TV emergency — say the Super Bowl or a major awards show. This observation aligns with the rise of streaming alternatives, which run the gamut and range from on-demand (Netflix) to live (Sling TV), and to super niche (British-TV-only app Acorn TV). Parks Associates tracks more than 130 of these over-the-top (OTT), as in over-the-Internet, services. It turns out that half of the 63 percent of U.S. broadband households that subscribe to an OTT service subscribe to more than one. Ultimately, these streaming choices let consumers piece together their own version of the classic cable bundle. That behavior is getting easier to do with the arrival of new set-top boxes such as AirTV and Tablo. The former merges streaming services with over-the-air signals, while the latter lets users stream and record over-the-air stations. Both plug into your home’s digital TV antenna. So, while the antenna may seem like a blast from past, it really presents a path to the future.

Apparently, these don’t apply to box-store shoppers, who sometimes walk around in their pajamas while filling their carts. As high school government teacher Vic Calcote explained when the topic of dress codes came up in class: “You wouldn’t want a guy who hasn’t had a bath in a month to sit next to you in class without a shirt and his hands on his head.” We had some interesting conversations in that government class that had little to do with government. But one could argue that a school dress code is somewhat like a government regulation. My first experience with a dress code was during my eighth-grade year at Abilene Junior High School. Being a golfer, I was more of a (sometimes pink) polo shirt, white pants, black belt dresser. It took a lot of courage to wear pink back then. According to attireclub.org, “Pink is a color that, throughout the 20th century and apparently in the beginning of the 21st century, too, has been strongly associated with the idea of ‘girliness.’ ” I guess, as a 13-year-old, I wasn’t influenced by social mores, and not much has changed 47 years later. I have been threatening to show off my legs by coming to the Journal morning meeting in a skirt. One spring day in 1970, I showed up to class in pastel bell-bottoms. Bell-bottoms are slacks or jeans that have a flair at the bottom, a bell-like shape, made popular by sailors. Mine looked like something Johnny Miller wore the year he became a professional golfer. One would have thought I was the guy who hadn’t bathed in a month and went to school with no shirt, or that I was wearing a skirt. I was instructed to “never wear them to school again” by one of the teachers. (Like I was trying to impress Tim Gunn.) By the fall of 1970, bell-bottoms were hip and cool. Pictures come to mind of Sonny and Cher, and of John Travolta in “Saturday Night Fever.” A similar humiliating incident happened many years later when my daughter Robin, at 13, attended Abilene Middle School. She was actually sent home to change because her skort, a combination of shorts and a skirt, was too short. The irony is that the outfit was given to her by her grandmother, who was the clerk of the school board at the time. I interviewed for a job once dressed in nice slacks and a dress shirt but without a tie. It was the attire I was accustomed to working in. Mistake. Back in 1980, a tie was required at that particular newspaper. Times have changed. Search “Wacky pictures at Walmart.” I really like the woman wearing a bed sheet, not to be confused with a real toga. Do they still enforce “No shoes, no shirt, no service?” Sen. Jerry Moran, who visited Salina last week and always wears a coat and tie, commented on how difficult it is to buy men’s formal clothing in locally owned stores. It has become more difficult to dress to the nines now that Headley’s Clothing, which used to be on South Ninth Street, has closed. Schools still have dress codes so that appearance does not present a physical danger and shall be neither obscene, indecent nor immoral. Salina’s school dress code also prohibits students from showing their underwear. That’s not a bad thing, at least until the sagging pants fad has faded. — Reporter Tim Horan can be reached at 822-1422 or by email at thoran@salina.com.

Josh Bromen said. The crash occurred about 6 p.m. just north of Airport Road, Bromen said. The Biloxi Police Department and Harrison County Coroner Gary Hargrove are taking the lead on the investigation, Bromen said. Hargrove was not immediately available to identify the pedestrian, or say whether it was a man or woman. Officials removed the body from the accident scene about 7:30 p.m. An evidence marker was placed next to a single shoe in the road about 30 feet north of where the body lay. Dozens of Gulfport police and fire vehicles were at the accident. A heavy rainstorm hit the area about the time the person was hit, but details about how the accident occurred are still uncertain. Several officers were working with accident-reconstruction devices. Witnesses coming out of the Wal-Mart store, more than 200 yards to the east of the accident, said they heard an impact. “We were leaving the Wal-Mart,” Nicole Pearson said, “and we heard what sounded like a large bang, a ‘Ka-boom.’ I thought it was two cars, just a bad wreck. When I got closer I saw the police.” Bromen said the department has contacted the District Attorney’s Office. Both north- and southbound lanes of 49 between Airport Road and Creosote Road were still shut down at 9 p.m. The Sun Herald will have more information as soon as it becomes available.

Photo by David Carson, dcarson@post-dispatch.com Jesse Bogan, St. Louis Post-Dispatch The Rev. Steven F. Poole is a priest in the Belleville Diocese. Photo by Jesse Bogan, jbogan@post-dispatch.com OKAWVILLE, Ill. • The Rev. Steven F. Poole is a rank-and-file priest with his own demons, including a history of theft and a rocky relationship with church hierarchy. Now the troubled priest has broken from tradition by calling out his boss and openly accusing a fellow priest of sexually abusing him as a 14-year-old boy. Echoing the core complaints of sex abuse scandals that have shaken the church, Poole alleges that the leader of the Belleville Diocese has mishandled and disregarded his complaint, allowing the now retired priest to continue in good standing. “This is difficult because I truly do believe in the sacred bond between a bishop and his priests as co-workers in the vineyard of the Lord,” Poole, 48, wrote in an email last year to Bishop Edward Braxton, who oversees all the Roman Catholic churches in Southern Illinois. “I realize that my words will probably make no difference to you based upon prior experience. However, it is important for me to set this out to attempt to clear my conscience.” The five-page letter, along with additional correspondence obtained by the Post-Dispatch, chronicles an effort by Poole over multiple years to trigger action by the diocese. The diocese, in turn, says in a written statement sent to the newspaper Thursday that it has thoroughly and properly responded to Poole’s allegations. Braxton declined to respond to a request for comment. The diocese said its internal review board and office of child protection as well as state authorities reviewed “this situation on numerous occasions.” “Several steps were originally taken under Bishop [Wilton] Gregory and more recently under Bishop Braxton. As always, the first and most important consideration is to insure the protection of minors. The Bishop must also be aware of and concerned with the health and well-being of the individuals involved; those considerations must remain confidential.” The accused priest — the Rev. Albert “Gene” Kreher — acknowledged in an interview this week that his behavior with Poole was inappropriate when Poole was a teenager, but said there was nothing sexual about the situation. He has never faced criminal charges or a civil lawsuit. “I have had a lot of youth in my life but none needed to feel threatened,” Kreher, 78, said by telephone. “I thought I was being a good pastor trying to serve as a role model. If my erotic inclinations were turned loose they would not be directed toward young people.” In hindsight, Kreher said, Poole needed somebody else to help him as a struggling boy. Poole “needed a psychologist, professional help, which I am not,” Kreher said. A 2010 letter Kreher wrote to Poole offered a different, less specific apology. “I acknowledge that parts of my relationship with you were very inappropriate and then to be repeated over a long period of time only adds to the shame,” he wrote, according to a copy of the letter. “I am sorry that I didn’t offer my apology a long time ago and regret the possibility that things I did a long time ago contribute to your present difficulties.” Asked about the apology letter, Kreher said: “The Bishop [Braxton] was telling me in part what to write. So I could not tell you what parts ended up in the letter itself.” Asked about the reference to “shame,” he said: “That part I really don’t remember because it was not a shameful relationship.” ‘I kept it secret’ Poole described his side of the story and current struggles in a long interview this week. He said Kreher befriended him in the early 1980s, when he was 14 and his parents were struggling to stay together. Poole said he became an altar boy and helped cut the grass at St. George Church in New Baden, where Poole grew up, 30 minutes east of St. Louis on Interstate 64. Poole said he eventually started spending weekends with the priest, sleeping naked with him in the rectory and while on camping trips. “He would hold me,” Poole said. “He would fondle me, kiss me and rub his genitals on me. He would tell me he loved me while he was doing those things. I was a boy, looking for a father figure.” He said the relationship confused him. After about a year and a half, Poole said, he drifted away from Kreher. “I began to want to hang around kids my own age,” Poole said. The priest “became very jealous. He said I was being disloyal. I withdrew from his bed. I couldn’t take it anymore.” “I was ashamed,” he added. “I kept it secret for years and years and years.” Poole said he reported the alleged abuse to another priest in the early 1990s and didn’t immediately hear anything back about it. While in college, he decided to pursue the priesthood. “In spite of him, I still wanted to be a priest,” Poole said. In 1997, one year after being ordained, Poole said, he received a call from the vicar general asking about the old allegations. “I minimalized it and really denied” the allegations,” Poole said, adding that he was caught off guard by the call. “It scared me because it brought up a lot of bad memories and I wasn’t psychologically prepared to deal with it yet. I probably should have.” Though he works in the same diocese, he said he hadn’t spoken to Kreher since his mother’s funeral in 2000. His mother, a devout Catholic, had been very close to Kreher and often had him over for meals. Now at 48, Poole says he is about the same age as Kreher was when their relationship began. “I am a middle-aged pastor today,” Poole said. “Sleeping with a 14-year-old boy is not what a pastor does.” ‘A lot of shame’ Poole’s career as a priest started to implode after his mother died of cancer 17 years ago. He said he took care of her in her final months. Not long after her death, he was sentenced to probation and 100 hours of community service for stealing a large antique sign from an art gallery in Ladue in the middle of the afternoon. He also told police that he’d made up a story about a stranger trying to attack and rob him at a church in Breese. In 2010, he was accused of stealing butter and switching a bar code tag on a mattress at Walmart. In 2011, he was arrested for taking an antique ashtray, the same year he was in detox for addiction to a prescription medication. “I know people might say this is psychobabble,” Poole said. “I am not blaming my problems and laying them at the foot of what happened to me as a kid, but I think that had something to do with it. I was really confused at that stage and I was very vulnerable — an adult priest that I trusted used me and that turned into a lot of shame.” Poole said parts of his abuse story started to come out during years of therapy and counseling. He said he told Braxton specifically about the alleged abuse in a private meeting on Easter in 2010. Poole said he was disheartened by Braxton’s response, which he said wasn’t apologetic. Instead, he said, Braxton placed some of the burden of reconciliation on Poole by suggesting that he possibly sit down and confront his alleged abuser face to face. The following month, Poole received the apology letter from Kreher which began: “I have delayed far too long to deal with something critical for both of us. I need to apologize very deeply for my commissions and omissions from years ago. Whatever my intentions, I did not do right by you.” ‘Investigated and resolved’ More recently, Poole has been struggling with Braxton over how to best handle two churches he’s been responsible for since 2014: St. Barbara’s in Okawville, and St. Anthony’s, in tiny Lively Grove. In a recent letter to Braxton, Poole mentioned disagreements on how to handle what “seemed to be some financial irregularities and practices at both parishes” that came to Poole’s attention. Poole wrote that the bishop wasn’t supporting him while some lay leaders at St. Anthony’s had grown vocal about not wanting Poole’s services as a priest. He also said parish leaders had rejected his efforts to have St. Anthony’s partner with St. Barbara’s. The rural parishes, and many other parishes in the diocese, face the reality of having fewer priests these days to staff remote congregations. Many resist attempts to merge. “The difficulties have reached the point where I have received threats of physical harm,” wrote Poole, wondering why his request to be reassigned wasn’t honored. Poole told Braxton in the letter that his inaction paralleled the handling of the old sex abuse claims. Braxton responded in a March 17, 2016, letter to Poole: “I remember well the very serious matter we discussed in my Residence six years ago. Contrary to your statement, your allegations were reported to the Review Board, thoroughly investigated and resolved. I do not see the parallel between that experience and the very serious difficulties you are now experiencing in both of the parishes that I have entrusted to your pastoral care.” The bishop asked Poole to schedule a new meeting with him. Poole said he didn’t do it based on advice from an independent church lawyer from out of state. Under investigation Poole said his therapist asked for permission to report the old sex abuse claims to the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services last year. That report spurred a complaint filed in New Baden last month. “The whole matter remains under investigation, so I am not going into detail,” said Scott Meinhardt, the police chief. “We are trying to investigate something that occurred 35 years ago. There are a lot of different factors at play.” Also late last year, Poole contacted the Boy Scouts. He told them that he was troubled to see that Kreher was still listed as the chaplain for the Diocesan Catholic Committee on Scouting. The Boy Scouts took swift action. “When we did learn of the allegations in 2016, we took action to preclude him from any further participation in the scouting program,” said Christine Rasure, spokeswoman for the Greater St. Louis Area Council of Boy Scouts. Asked by telephone about the chaplain position, Kreher said he’d been working with only adult scout leaders. He said he resigned from his Scout commitments in recent months. “I felt like I wasn’t serving them well to begin with,” the priest said. “For a long time, I felt that. It was a good time because I since have spent several days in the hospital.” While in the hospital, he said, representatives of Children and Family Services visited him about the “nonsense” from the old claims by Poole. But Poole said he remained tormented from their relationship decades ago. He is steadfast in demanding that his diocese — and his bishop — set the record straight: “I am trying to move on in my life from being a victim to a survivor.” Tags Steven F.

But Calgary police homicide Det. Mike Shute, who helped arrange the raid by the RCMP's emergency response team, said no one was found, dead, or alive, during the July 4, 2014, search. Shute said the warrantless search was conducted because police believed they might have found Alvin and Kathy Liknes, and their grandson Nathan O'Brien, inside. Garland, 56, is charged with first-degree murder in connection with the June 30, 2014, disappearance of the couple from their Parkhill home along with the five-year-old boy. Their bodies have never been found. Shute told Crown prosecutor Shane Parker the search was considered a potential rescue mission and occurred after he placed Garland under investigative detention for kidnapping after he was grabbed in a traffic stop near his property. It followed a tip initiated by Garland's sister, Patti, that her brother drove a green Ford F-150 pickup similar to one caught on video surveillance near the scene of the Liknes' home. Patti Garland earlier testified she sent photos of the truck to her then-common law husband, Allen Liknes, the son of the missing grandfather. After Shute met with Patti Garland at an Airdrie park he went to the local RCMP detachment to arrange for the emergency response team to raid the rural farm. Before the search was conducted, Mounties stopped Garland in his pickup truck near the property before Shute dealt with the then-kidnapping suspect. "His demeanour was fine ... and he was cooperative at the time," said Shute of the accused. After the unsuccessful search for victims Shute took continuity of the 16-hectare farm after a debrief from an RCMP corporal. The Calgary officer was told "there was a burn barrel still smouldering on the property," and a bag was found containing a billy bat and handcuffs. It's the Crown's theory Garland kidnapped the three victims, took them to his farm and murdered them there. In her opening address, co-prosecutor Vicki Faulkner said Garland's motive for the crime was a years' old grudge he had against Alvin Liknes for not giving him credit for a pump the deceased had patented in the early 2000s. Meanwhile, court also heard from a footwear expert who examined partial bloodied footprints found inside the Liknes home. Sgt. Lynn Gallen said she compared the prints to a pair of size 13 Delta 2 Dr. Scholl's runners purchased by police at a Walmart store. The shoes were bought after police found an empty shoe box inside the Garland home for that product. Gallen found at least nine, and possibly 10, partial prints in the residence, primarily near a set of bloodstained dumbbells in the garage. She showed the three-woman, 11-man jury a series of powerpoint slides showing the footprints matched the treading on the bottom of the shoes. But under cross-examination by defence lawyer Kim Ross, Gallen agreed no such shoes were found at the Garland residence. Gallen also said they eliminated all shoes found at the accused's home as being the ones that made the bloody prints. Week two of the five-week trial begins Monday.

Skip to content Home News Sports Metro Plus Politics Business Entertainment Opinion Editorial Columnists Jobs Sections Search for: Entertainment Unnecessary politics in boardrooms puts me off –Olatorera Oniru Published January 21, 2017January 21, 2017 Share Tweet Pin it +1 Olatorera Oniru is the founder and CEO of Dressmeoutlet.com. In this interview with JESUSEGUN ALAGBE, she talks about her outlook on life, career, family and others In April 2016, Forbes described you as ‘the Nigerian woman who is building the fashion Amazon of Africa.’ How did you get that kind of recognition just two months after you launched Dressmeoutlet.com? I would assume a mix of factors was responsible. The market has a ton of opportunities that would interest a wide global audience and as a representative from Google once said to us, there is strong interest/demand for African products, yet there is low supply. The world is largely anticipating the boom of made in Africa products. The team at Forbes might have been impressed with the user interface, user experience or other factors they were able to decipher from Dressmeoutlet.com. To have also been nominated as a Most Promising Entrepreneur in Africa, surely they delved into my background, work experiences, awards and leadership potentials. You once worked at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Ericsson, the Central Bank of Nigeria and General Electric. Why did you quit regular jobs to launch Dressmeoutlet.com? I had a career growth plan from my entrepreneurship days and moving from paid employment to entrepreneurship was part of that plan. I worked in paid employment for over a decade across industries and across continents. My career plan was to accumulate solid education plus solid work experiences and then launch a series of notable businesses across Africa. Dressmeoutlet.com is the starting point for my post-employment business development goals. On the day you quit your last job to start your own company, what thoughts ran through your mind? I was relatively happy and this was probably because I was confident that the work experiences I had garnered were strong enough to propel me as an entrepreneur and I had saved up precisely well for the startup phase of the business. On the other hand, I knew I would miss the perks and comfort of the employed world — from frequent travels, to fixed salaries, to health care, pensions and more. All those perks could not hold me back much, if at all, because I was ready to create them and much more for myself and thousands of employees. This is why I continue to work tirelessly to grow the company and other businesses we are associated with. Within one year, Dressmeoutlet.com has grown to employ over 30 employees and we are not ready to slow down anytime soon. We want to continue sourcing and retailing the very best made in Africa fashion, beauty and home products to the world. How did working on Wall Street affect your outlook on life? Working on Wall Street was amazing — you get to feel and enjoy the real hustle and bustle of life. You also get to learn a whole lot. I took several free classes at the Merrill Lynch University and I networked with a lot of gurus in the industry. Sum up your experience in 2016 in three words. Start-up. Growth. Results. Were there times men intimidated you because of your success in the marketplace, especially as a woman, and tell us how you handled the intimidations? No intimidations here. We all have goals and missions in life. Everyone should be pushing their dreams and no one should be intimidated by another’s success or attempt to intimidate another based on their success. We must all push our dreams and support each other. Africa more than ever before needs much less competition and much more collaborations. Work together, push dreams and be great, individually and collectively. As many more citizens become great and greater, the entire nation will continue to grow into greatness. What’s the first thought that comes to your mind when you wake up? Appreciation for my beautiful family. My family means the world to me and I’m always glad and grateful to have them as we push our dreams together, smile together, laugh together and work hard together. Who is your favourite foreign artiste? I’m not sure I have a favourite, but over the years, I’ve enjoyed the music of Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. Who is your favourite Nigerian artiste? I do not have a favourite, but I’ve liked certain songs produced by Mavin Records. Recently, I haven’t had as much time as I’d love to get to know the artistes behind the songs. As an entrepreneur and during your working years, you must have travelled to so many countries. Which is your favourite country so far? Nigeria remains my favourite and then the United States of America and then Turkey. All three are amazing countries, with Nigeria topping the list, as everything that makes me happy stems from within Nigeria — from my family, to investments, to friends, to career plans, and to growth potentials. The other two are second and third homes to me as I always have a great time when I go there and I lived in both for extended periods of time. If you could meet a legend, dead or alive, who would it be? If I could meet a legend, I’d say Sam Walton, the late founder of Walmart USA. Then maybe Jesus, regarded by Christians as the saviour of the world. Additionally, Coco Chanel, Mother Theresa and Oprah Winfrey. Who are the people who influence you in the business world? My father and my husband. What is your favourite business movie of all time? Honestly, I very rarely watch movies and if I do or ever have, I won’t remember the title. I only remember ‘Sound of Music’ and that’s about it. What is the greatest piece of advice you’ve ever heard? “Yes, we can” by Barack Obama. What keeps you awake at night while you should be sleeping? Work. I enjoy working, especially when I derive and exceed expected results. When my family goes to bed, I pull out my laptop and complete pending tasks and then create new tasks. It’s a non-stop cycle that I enjoy. What makes you angry? Anything unethical, wicked and unfair. I do not support wicked, unethical and unfair greed, also known as corruption — when certain men who forced themselves politically into leadership positions fail to create opportunities and developments yet harbour stolen wealth for themselves and the citizens who labour hard suffer in silence. If you were to give young women some pieces of advice to succeed in the marketplace, what would they be? Please, push your dreams. Don’t let anything stop you from doing anything great for the world. Be your very best in all your undertakings, love yourself and be the change you want to see in other leaders. Tell us how you met your husband? I met him during a business meeting we scheduled half a decade ago. We were discussing some business development plans and ended up loving each other’s company so much that we became a couple and then a family. What is your business philosophy? Work hard and innovate more. Do things because the impact is great — you are either able to change lives or make the world a better place. Money or personal wealth should not be the driving factors of greatness or success. What are your passions apart from business? Family, friends, dancing and having a great time. I love to have fun. I also still like travelling a bit. But lately, work doesn’t let me stay out of the country for more than 48 hours thereabout. What are the things that put you off in the boardroom? Lack of preparedness and unnecessary politics. Or being overly judgemental for personal reasons. Everyone should have equal rights to voice their opinions and contribute to discussions and developments. What qualities are essential for business success? Strength, vigour, versatility, love and care. What book are you reading now? Not reading one at the moment, but writing one. Looking back, tell us one singular decision you took that made you who you are today. Working on Wall Street was one of the best career decisions I made. I had other lucrative job offers after graduation and I’m very glad I went with the Wall Street offer. I learnt an ample lot, developed my financial acumen and grew significantly during my hustle and bustle years on Wall Street. I also made amazing friends that are still a significant part of my life today. As a leader, what does leadership mean to you? Leadership means having the means, resources and capabilities to do whatever it takes to make other people happy. Leaders are the driving forces of what they are leading. You are either driving a community, business, nation or family. Whatever you are driving, leaders must be great at what they do, they must have the knowledge and experience to succeed and they must have the love and passion for excellence and for making other people happy. Which business leader — Nigerian or foreign — has impacted your life most? I really enjoyed Barack Obama’s pre-presidency campaign and I also enjoyed his eight-year reign as president of one of the world’s greatest countries. His common quote “Yes we can” resonated very well with me throughout my university days and beyond. Copyright PUNCH.                All rights reserved.

Abiola I hate marriage by proxy , rubbish. D coming together of a man and a woman to sign d marriage agreement on d marriage day is one fit Africans have achieved. Cos it was done without the consent of d bride and groom b4. So if we are performing marriage in absentia nw , does it mean we are gradually reversing back to that old era ? Ahmed Marriage in absentia is not a taboo nor a terrible idea in Islam. As opined by Imam Abdulrahman “For this to be done, there has to be an assurance that both of them are really consenting to the union. The officiating minister must have spoken to both of them. He must have established on solid authority that the two parties are down with the arrangement. “It must be established that nobody is being coerced; nobody is being forced or tricked into such union. If there are practical difficulties of either of them being physically present, that would be the exceptional case I alluded to earlier on. It is not a taboo.” This is actually a personal experience where both parties and their parents knew each other and speak on a regular basis. The wife couldn’t take time off at work and I believe you’ll understand how the UK working system operates. The union is blessed with a child and both parties are living together in the UK. Sola I have a friend whose proxy wife has not been able to travel to join him going to 5 yrs now. The poor lady who is closed to menopause now is still waiting. Prince Adu/Tokyo IT’S IGBO STYLE. My Landlady before i left Nigeria had waited for her Husband in Germany for 15 years even when she knew the Man has married a German Woman with Kids as people were coming to tell her that the Husband has married,she was still waiting… This style is very common in IGBO LAND,all the names mentioned here are Igbos,…My Landlady Lives in ABA while she was also sleeping with Men too…..Is that Marriage too? Hans wow, Prince the african tribal warrior, did you read the story? Jurisconsult The first marriage ceremony in the Bible, that of Isaac and Rebecca was by proxy. Isaac was not there. Nothing wrong with it if there is good faith in the parties concerned. AduragbaPrayerpoint The story of how Isaac and Rebecca married was by divine arrangement. you may wish to know it was borne out of the fact Abraham and God had a convenantal relationship and so it was. Marriage by proxy today has to do with either material gain or out of desperation. In the late 90s,public servants were relocated to Abuja and many marriages were ruined irrepairably. The wise ones relocated with their spouses including some Christian couples while those who could afford flight always see their spouses every weekend until they sorted themselves out.Marriage by proxy should only be entertained in rare cases especially if the would- be couple have fulfilled all requirements and with the consent of the parents and the period of absentia not more than three months so that the devil with not capitalize on the vulnerability of either of them. The devil comes to steal, kill and destroy.Be wise! Toke This type of wedding is not that bad. It depends on who is living abroad between the couples. My uncle did it and is successful. He and his wife are living happily with there lovely kids in Canada. farooq such marriages are already under duress before they even start out………………… Kelvin This type of marriage can never stand the test of time Family Spice Special Features Education Vox Pop Sex & Relationship Letters Privacy Policy Terms of Use About punchng.com © 1971-2017 The Punch newspaper

The commission’s discussion of Shelter Ridge application will continue at its Feb. 14 meeting in the city hall auditorium. Mayor Mark Lauretti said this most recent extension granted by developers is to assure that whatever plan is approved for the 121-acre piece of land is the best option for the city. “What’s the hurry? This is a big project,” said Lauretti. Conservation Commission Chairman Tom Harbinson didn’t speak at the meeting but said the extension could have both positive and negative effects after the Shelter Ridge portion was completed. “Time is good for contemplation, but time is also the enemy of economic development. Because time is money. That’s the balance we’re trying to achieve here. We want to be responsive to a developer that wants to invest in our community but you also want to be thoughtful to the people who live here.” Residents in attendance groaned and some left when Parkins announced there wouldn’t be a vote made at the meeting. The opposition Prior to the Thursday night special meeting, a dozen or so protesters gathered outside of city hall with picket signs in hand to try to persuade the commission to deny the project. One of the leaders to the opposition known as Save Our Shelton (S.O.S.), Gregory Tetro said he was disgusted to learn that there are already several other residential developments being proposed within the city. “This is a tipping point for the community… There’s already other ‘Shelter Ridges’ being proposed,” said Tetro. “Applicants propose one set of residential units and before we can even see them built, there are already several others appearing before the P&Z. It’s all happening too fast. Shelton is for sale.” Tetro said he still believes that there are still “efficient alternatives” that the city could use the land for, rather than build the mixed-use development. “I expect for this space to be developed,” said Tetro. “The city could buy a portion of the land. There’s a strong chance that if they bought the whole thing they could put city hall there, they could put the new Echo Hose fire department there, they can move stuff in there to be useful, dignified, while also protecting the Paugussett Trail.” The disruption of the Paugussett Trail was one of the most common issues expressed by the opposition, as it represents 25 years of work towards making it connect to Stratford’s town line.   Peter Squitieri of Shelton also spoke at the protest and said the 300,000 square feet of high end retail, which would be included in the Shelter Ridge plan if it were to be approved as presented, is not a good fit for the city, nor practical for 2017. “Ecommerce is taking over,” said Squitieri. “We don’t need high end retail. Everyone is shopping online. Amazon has surpassed Wal-Mart as the number one retailer. Macy’s stores are closing across the country.” Another commonly expressed issue that was also a big reason the commission asked for an extension, is traffic. Both, Commissioners Jimmy Tickey and Virginia Harger said they would like to see the width of Bridgeport Avenue widened to adjust to any increase in traffic. Residents could be heard whispering, “It’s a simple thumbs down or thumbs up,” while the commission listened to Planning and Zoning Consultant Anthony Panico review a condensed version of the information on the development. Panico expressed that he also has concerns of the effects the development would have on traffic because he’s already seen an increase with the construction of Big Y. Although there was no vote casted by the commission, Commissioner Tickey and Anthony Pagoda were the only two that voiced issue with the proposed zone change to a PDD. The commission did agree that they would like to see the scale of residential units decreased to around 375 units from the previously adjusted 411.   Meeting dynamics Panico was not physically present for the meeting, but participated in the discussion about the application for the 121-acre development via telephone from Florida. Multiple residents said they were displeased that Panico wasn’t present for the meeting, but Chairman Parkins said the means of communication is accepted for P&Z meetings. Parkins added that the policy which enables members of the board or the consultant to participate in a discussion via telephone is a policy that the commission doesn’t plan to change. The chairman defended the policy despite having to ask Panico multiple times during the commission’s discussion to speak up because it was difficult to hear him over the phone “We’ve had him call into meetings for many many years now,” said Parkins. “…As a taxpayer you’re certainly welcome to come to city hall and get a copy of the tapes because it is all tape recorded.Telephonic participation is allowed by state statute.” Chairman addresses opposition Parkins said despite the opposition’s surprisingly large turnout throughout the duration of the hearings, the “silent masses that won’t speak” are a larger support in favor of the development. “There’s 36,000 people that live in this city. So I think there’s a silent majority out there that’s been just a little too silent on their preference,” Parkins said. “So if they don’t really care one way or the other, they don’t mind seeing it once it happens, they just have not come and been outspoken. I can certainly appreciate why.” Tetro disagreed. “I’ve been to every diner that’s in this town, I’ve been to bars, I’ve been to pizzerias and I still haven’t found those people,” said Tetro. “If there out there, they’re huddled in a cave some where because they’re not out there. Everyone I’ve spoken to has said they don’t like it, they don’t want it, but they fear retribution from the mayor because they are business owners.” Growth v.s. swelling Commissioner Tickey said the proposed site plan and information presented portrayed a very “rosy” picture for the commission. “There’s growth and then there’s swelling. I think something like this is so enormous it takes our eyes off the ball and potential development that we could have elsewhere in the city, such as downtown. I think this wildly goes beyond what I would consider appropriate for commercial development on Bridgeport Ave… I do agree with economic development and I have a record of supporting that here, but this goes so beyond balanced development. In the city’s charter it reads that P&Z commissioners are responsible for making sure all developments are in the best interest of residents. “For me, this doesn’t meet the standard that’s put on us,” said Tickey.

The marijuana industry is poised to soar now that California, Massachusetts, Maine, and Nevada just legalized recreational marijuana. And because Money Morning Director of Tech & Venture Capital Research Michael A. Robinson sees California as a leader in cutting-edge issues, other states will quickly follow suit. "Fact is, California stands as one of the world's largest economies, so just the sheer volume of sales in the state would be massive. As we have seen with things like environmental legislation and gay rights, the state is on the cutting edge of major issues that have socioeconomic impacts. Other states will look at California's success in rolling this out as their model for legislation," Robinson told me on Nov. 8. You see, investing in the marijuana industry is being called the gold rush of the 21st century. And we don't want Money Morning readers to miss out. Along with our five 2017 marijuana stocks to watch, we'll also show you how you can get our 90-page investment guide for the booming marijuana industry. Here's the first on our list of marijuana stocks to watch in 2017… Marijuana Stocks to Watch in 2017 No. 5: mCig Inc MCig Inc. (OTCMKTS: MCIG) is a penny stock, and penny stocks can be risky. But even with the risks, MCIG is a marijuana stock to watch in 2017. MCig is based in Nevada, and it offers equipment for marijuana home growers, vaporizers, greenhouses, and cultivation rooms. Rollies LLC, owned by mCig, sells smoking tubes that could increase in popularity with more states approving recreational marijuana policies. BRILLIANT: Average Americans Are Becoming Marijuana Millionaires And as marijuana is legalized in more states, the demand for mCig's products will increase. For their fiscal 2016, mCig reported $1.7 billion in revenue and gross profit of $290,774. Over the last 12 months, MCIG has climbed 282.76%. Marijuana Stocks to Watch in 2017 No. 4: GW Pharmaceuticals Plc. GW Pharmaceuticals Plc. (Nasdaq ADR: GWPH) uses plant-derived cannabinoid therapeutics to help patients suffering from various diseases and medical conditions. GW's Sativex is the first prescription medicine derived from a cannabis plant, and it's used to treat spasticity. GW is also working on a product called Epidiolex, which could be used by patients with rare epilepsy disorders. Because marijuana is listed as a Schedule I drug, it can't be used for medical purposes. But legalization and marijuana reform could help it get reclassified, which would allow GW to offer more plant-derived cannabinoid therapeutics. GWPH has skyrocketed over 50% in the last 12 months. In comparison, the S&P 500 has climbed just 6.42%. Marijuana Stocks to Watch in 2017 No. 3: General Cannabis Corp. Source: FactSet General Cannabis Corp. (OTCMKTS: CANN) provides services to the regulated cannabis industry. General Cannabis provides a large list of services, including: Acquisitions and leasing of cultivation space Security services including video surveillance and cash transportation services Designing, distribution, and selling of apparel Consulting services General Cannabis was founded in 2013. It's headquartered in Colorado, the first state to legalize recreational marijuana. According to the Denver Post, legal marijuana sales in Colorado alone are expected to reach $1 billion for 2016. Over the last 12 months, the CANN stock price has climbed 315%. Aside from MCIG, GWPH, and CANN, there are two other companies involved in the marijuana industry that are worth watching in 2017. Marijuana isn't the core of their businesses, but these companies are creating partnerships and filling a growing demand through their already successful products and services. These are the two other companies in the marijuana industry Robinson is keeping an eye on… Marijuana Stocks to Watch in 2017 No. 2: Microsoft Corp. It's true most investors wouldn't view Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT) as a marijuana stock. But this past June, Microsoft used its powerful software and cloud services to become the go-to source for the cannabis industry. KIND Financial, a company that uses technology to make sure transactions in the marijuana industry are safe, secure, and compliant, partnered with Microsoft in June to run software through Microsoft's cloud. As more states legalize marijuana, there will be a bigger need to track sales and to make sure local businesses are compliant with rules and regulations. The MSFT stock price is already up 9.3% in the last 12 months, with its cloud-based services revenue climbing 116% year over year in its latest quarter. Trending Story: States Legalizing Marijuana in 2017 Its software services in the booming marijuana industry will help that number continue to climb. And our final marijuana stock to watch in 2017 may be just as surprising as Microsoft… Marijuana Stocks to Watch in 2017 No. 1: Scotts Mircale-Gro Co. The other company Robinson is watching is Scotts Miracle-Gro Co. (NYSE: SMG). You can find Scotts' lawn care and gardening products in some of the leading retail stores in the country, like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) and Home Depot Inc. (NYSE: HD). Between 2001 and 2009, revenue climbed 80% for Scotts because retailers like Walmart and Home Depot were expanding. But since the financial collapse of 2008-2009, sales have been stagnant, according to Forbes. In order to increase revenue growth, CEO Jim Hagedorn is now investing millions in the marijuana industry. Hagedorn purchased two companies that sell fertilizers, soil, and accessories for marijuana growers back in 2015. He also invested $120 million (a 75% stake) in the hydroponics equipment company Gavita International in July 2016. But there are even more companies for investors to target a seven-figure weed windfall with the top pot stocks from every ecosystem – growers, edibles, dispensaries, and more… As a service to Money Morning readers, we're now making available a 90-page cannabis investing guide called "The Roadmap to Marijuana Millions." This "bible of weed investing" reveals the world's top marijuana stocks every serious investor should consider right now. Normally valued at $499, it can be yours absolutely free.

I have bells going off on a little sign stating a merger or Buyout is on the rise. CGC to buy or merge OGI. Ill bet buyout. I say this because its imminent. There profitability is endless and going international. If a new Etf is introduced in the Pot sector which it will have to be as the seed is planted and vines are attaching themselves for future growth. I dont need all the details. I just know now that Bedrocan is in bed with Goldman and Sachs. OGI is a threat and a profitable one to boot. Only valued at an 1/8 of CGC but both companies were or still are managed by the same advisors in which tells me Goldman and Sachs arent far from OGI's front door with a butt load of money. I know I would do it. Canada has not legalized it as of yet but are young Premier smokes himself and loves his new attention. So! The choice will be easy for him. Mid 2017. My outlook on Canaopy growth is the the driving force of the industry and i forsee the mentality and outlook of a Sunedison mentality but with a much more intelligent board on hand to manage the rising demand of this substance. My only worry comes from years from now as we see how they control there overwhelming success. Greed is a dangerous and blinding mentality but those actions are to be followed after they reach 20 billion in the next 3 years. Enjoy your day!

JANET McCONNAUGHEY and KEVIN MCGILL, The Associated Press Published: January 20, 2017, 8:41 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) NEW ORLEANS (AP) — The suspect in the slayings of a police officer and a woman shot himself Friday after an hours-long standoff on a New Orleans bridge but is alive, a Louisiana state police spokesman said. Trooper Dustin Dwight said the man identified as Sylvester Holt shot himself once in the chest Friday evening. Dwight said negotiators had been talking with Holt but he does not know what was said. Holt was on a girder below and to the side of the bridge roadway when the shooting happened. Dwight said rescue workers were going down to get Holt. News outlets have reported that Holt has been brought back up. The self-inflicted gunshot wound brought an end to a chaotic day that began with the early morning shooting death of Westwego Officer Michael Louviere, 26, and Simone Veal, 32, of Marrero. According to witnesses, the shooter fired at Veal, then chased her car in his vehicle to an intersection where she hit a truck waiting at a light, Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s spokesman John Fortunato said. Louviere, whose shift ended at 6 a.m. Friday, was on his way home after work when he spied the crash and stopped to help. The man shot Louviere in the head, then ran around the car and shot Veal as she lay on the ground, Fortunato said. Fortunato didn’t know whether she’d been hit in the earlier shooting. Fortunato identified Holt as a person of interest and suspect in the double shooting. As authorities searched for Holt, police shut the Mississippi River bridge from New Orleans’ east bank to its west bank, causing traffic to back up for miles, because a man later identified as Holt was threatening to jump from it. Helicopters circled the area as news crews and photographers watched intently. Louviere was described as a dedicated family man with a strong work ethic; he was married and had a 1-year-old son and a 4-year-old daughter, Fortunato said. According to Westwego Police Chief Dwayne Munch, he was a rising star likely bound for a job at a larger agency. “We knew we wouldn’t have him for long. We just didn’t know he would be gone this soon,” Munch said. Prior to his career in law enforcement, Louviere was a U.S. Marine who served in Afghanistan, Munch said. He joined the department in July 2015 and “finished first in everything” in his police academy class of roughly 20 recruits, Munch said. Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand said earlier Friday that dozens of officers from multiple agencies were searching for Holt. Several women had taken out protective orders against him between 2012 and November 2016, the sheriff said. He had also been arrested in September after being accused of rape. But Jefferson Parish District Attorney Paul Connick Jr. said the rape charge was later dropped after the woman repeatedly told authorities she wanted to withdraw the charge, though she still alleged that he had raped her. Holt was released from jail on Jan. 7. Connick said Holt contended the sex was consensual. Munch said he and a doctor broke the news to Louviere’s wife at a hospital that her husband had died. “That was probably the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do,” the chief said. The shooting happened outside Visitation of Our Lady School, Archdiocese of New Orleans spokeswoman Sarah Comiskey McDonald said. Veal did not work there, she said in an email. The school teaches pre-kindergarten through seventh grade. Friday’s shooting comes after a sharp increase last year in the number of police officers killed in the line of duty — including a pair of deadly ambushes in Louisiana and Texas. On July 7, a sniper in Dallas killed five law enforcement officers and wounded nine others at the end of what had been a peaceful rally against police brutality. Less than two weeks later, a lone gunman shot and killed three law enforcement officers and wounded three others in an attack outside a Baton Rouge, Louisiana, convenience store. On Wednesday, authorities arrested a man accused of fatally shooting an Orlando, Florida, police officer outside a Wal-Mart on Jan. 9. Munch, Westwego’s police chief, said Louviere helped patrol Baton Rouge after the deadly shootings in that city and helped patrol neighboring Denham Springs after August’s historic flooding. “Typical Michael,” the chief said. ___ Associated Press staffers Michael Kunzelman in Baton Rouge and Rebecca Santana and Jonathan Bachmann in New Orleans contributed to this report.
