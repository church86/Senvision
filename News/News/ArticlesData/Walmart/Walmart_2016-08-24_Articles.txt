Kaya Yurieff Aug 25, 2016 1:12 PM EDT Updated from 11:13 AM EDT. NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Shares of Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Dollar General (DG) were tumbling in midday trading on Thursday after both discount retailers reported weak quarterly results. Dollar General also reiterated its full-year guidance for earnings per share falling between 10% and 15%. "I thought that was interesting that they reiterated given the fact that how really kind of subpar it was," TheStreet's Jim Cramer said of the quarter on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" this morning. Cramer added that the discount retailer also cited "unseasonably mild spring weather." "What does that mean, you bought less Velveeta?" Cramer wondered. "No one else cited the unseasonably mild spring weather of the companies that I deal with...I thought that was curious. It raised eyebrows." Dollar Tree and Dollar General posted "very disappointing" numbers, Cramer added in the above video, saying that if consumers are feeling better they tend not to shop at dollar stores. Additionally, Cramer said that dollar discount retailers are being pressured by Walmart Stores (WMT). Walmart CEO Doug McMillon "is upending the whole retail world. Walmart is driving some everyday low prices like they did in the old days when they put out of business a lot of companies," Cramer noted. The retail giant has raised wages for workers so they do not go to a competitor. The company has also made it so that consumers are "very conscious" that it has cut prices, according to Cramer. Walmart is "livelier. They kept the employees for once," Cramer stated.

(DG), St. Jude Medical, Inc. (STJ) and Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks DG, ESRX and STJ stock used more than their fair share of red ink on Thursday By James Brumley, InvestorPlace Feature Writer  |  Aug 25, 2016, 4:43 pm EST     Popular Posts: 10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in 2017 Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Is Due for Even BIGGER Gains 5 Retail Stocks That May Not Be Around Next Christmas Recent Posts: Eli Lilly and Co (LLY) Drug Failure Doesn’t Answer the Bigger Question The Dow Jones Is Completely Defying Expectations Why Medtronic PLC (MDT), Dycom Industries, Inc. (DY) and Palo Alto Networks Inc (PANW) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks View All Posts Without any good news to distract them from the fact that stocks are technically overbought and fundamentally overvalued, investors tested the bearish waters again today. And this time, they took a bigger bite. The S&P 500‘s close of 2,172.47 was 0.14% below Wednesday’s close, but more than that, pulled the index under a key support line near 2,175. It was even worse for owners of Dollar General Corp. (NYSE:DG), Express Scripts Holding Company (NASDAQ:ESRX) and St. Jude Medical, Inc. (NYSE:STJ) though. Here’s why these three names were hit as hard as they were. Dollar General Corp. (DG) Deep discount chain Dollar General undeniably had to do whatever it had to do to compete with drastic price cuts from giant rival Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT). Problem is, the price war has taken a much bigger fiscal toll on Dollar General — and now DG shares — than it ever will on Wal-Mart. The bad news: In its second quarter of the year, Dollar General earned $1.08 per share on $5.39 billion worth of revenue. Both were better than the year-ago comparisons when the retailer earned 95 cents per share of DG on sales of $5.10 billion. The pros, however, were expecting a profit of $1.09 per share and sales of $5.5 billion. 7 of the Worst Stocks on Wall Street Buckingham Research commented in the big miss, “The laundry list of reasons for the sales slowdown is also not particularly reassuring.” DG shares ended the day down 17%, while close-cousin Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) fell 10% after investors assumed the two are suffering a similar fate. Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX) It may have only been a victim of circumstance, but it was a victim nonetheless. Express Scripts Holding shares fell 6% after Mylan NV (NASDAQ:MYL) announced it would be lowering the price of its EpiPen, which can be used to treat dangerous allergic reactions. The matter was put front and center this week when the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairperson Chuck Grassley asked Mylan CEO Heather Bresch to explain the more-than-400% price hike for the EpiPen in less than a decade. Recognizing there was no good answer, Mylan acquiesced and cut the price of the EpiPen by nearly half. The lower price is also a big blow to Express Scripts Holding Company, which enjoyed a steep markup on the devices it sold to consumers. Rival CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) is also vulnerable to the EpiPen price cut, sending CVS shares lower by more than 3%. St. Jude Medical, Inc. (STJ) Finally, it remains to be seen if the accusations are true or not, but St. Jude Medical investors weren’t taking any chances. STJ stock tumbled 5% on Thursday following reports that research firm Muddy Waters’ Carson Block cautioned the company’s medical devices have a major security flaw. Specifically, Block warned that St. Jude Medical’s Merlin@home remote monitoring devices don’t make secure connections with the patient’s monitoring service. St. Jude Medical denies the allegation, responding that its equipment uses several security protocols. It’s also worth noting that Muddy Waters has a history of making strong, publicized accusations including of companies he may be holding a short position in. In those cases, Block could profit from their stock’s pullback. Interestingly, Muddy Waters’ claim materialized just before Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) was to complete the acquisition of St. Jude Medical. The claim could prompt Abbott to back out of the deal, which would send STJ shares plummeting. As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

New Walmart Neighborhood Market brings jobs to Cape Coral Special to The News-Press 8:26 a.m. EDT August 26, 2016 Wal-Mart has 11,527 stores under 63 banners in 28 countries. (Photo: Scott Olson, Getty Images) 214 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORE A new Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market will open to the community Wednesday, Aug. 31, at 2020 N.E. Pine Island Road in Cape Coral. Along with a broad assortment of fresh, affordable groceries, customers will also enjoy the convenience of on-site services such as a full pharmacy and fuel station. A free store pickup service will provide an easy way to shop millions of products on Walmart.com. The new store will employ up to 95 full- and part-time associates and will be open from 5 a.m. to midnight, seven days a week. “We are proud to be a part of the Cape Coral community,” said store manager Tanya Parrish. “We look forward to opening and providing area residents with Wal-Mart’s everyday low prices. Labor Day is just around the corner, and we’ll have everything customers need for their holiday picnics and cookouts. We invite all our friends and neighbors to stop by and see their new store on grand opening day.” The store offers fresh produce and meat, pantry staples and a full line of groceries from leading brands. In addition to organics and nutritious food choices, customers will also find a full-service deli and in-store bakery offering personalized cakes and fresh baked breads. The new store will carry a selection of Florida Grown products. The Neighborhood Market includes a pharmacy with a full range of products, immunizations and services and Wal-Mart pharmacists ready to assist customers with product and prescription questions. Cape Coral residents can easily transfer prescriptions and order refills on the go with the Wal-Mart mobile app. A drive thru pharmacy window makes prescription drop off and pick up quick and easy. THE NEWS-PRESS Goodwill opens new Cape Coral location The store is approximately 41,000 square feet and offers a wide assortment of products to meet the needs of Cape residents. Customers will find health and beauty aids, pet products and cleaning supplies. Shopping is convenient with seven million items on Walmart.com, many of which can be shipped for free to any Wal-Mart store through Wal-Mart Pickup. “We welcome Wal-Mart’s continuing investment within our Pine Island Road Corridor, which is becoming a prime location for retail and commercial business expansion,” said Mayor Marni Retzer. The new Cape Coral store will employ up to 95 associates for full- and part-time positions within the store. Applicants interested in careers at Wal-Mart can apply at a store’s hiring kiosk or online at Walmartcareers.com. Parrish, began her Wal-Mart career in 1984 as an hourly associate at a store in Port Charlotte. Starting in 2015, Wal-Mart began making a $2.7 billion investment over a two-year period in higher wages, more scheduling choices and further training for its associates. As part of increased wages across the company, the average full time hourly associate now makes $13.80 an hour in Florida. More than 75 percent of store management teams started as hourly associates. “One of the biggest challenges for a growing city like Cape Coral is providing adequate job opportunities,” said City Manager John Szerlag. “The additional jobs Wal-Mart is bringing to our community will help address this challenge.” The grand-opening celebration includes presentations of $8,000 in grants from the Wal-Mart Foundation to local community groups including Caloosa Elementary School, Diplomat Middle School, Cape Coral High School, Boy Scouts of America-Southwest Florida Council, Ronald McDonald House, Dress for Success and Animal Refuge Center. Local associates will provide a special welcome to members of Cape Coral at two public events. Store associates will host a brief ribbon-cutting ceremony during Wednesday’s grand opening day at 7:30 a.m. The following Saturday, Sept. 3, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., and Sunday, Sept. 4, from noon to 4 p.m., local residents are invited to A Big Family Welcome celebration. This will give customers a chance to meet store manager Tanya Parrish and enjoy fun family activities and free food samples while supplies last. 214 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://newspr.es/2bZP7wv TOP VIDEOS Who is Nikki Haley? 1:30 TSA: These things didn't make it on to a SWFL airplane Sept and Oct 1:08 Better than an apple.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Walmart, Kroger, and Dollar General are fighting in a war  and that's great news for shoppers Thursday Aug 25, 2016 at 3:33 PM Hayley Peterson Thomson Reuters Competition is heating up between America's biggest grocery chains, and food prices are falling as a result. Dollar General said Thursday that it's cutting prices on hundreds of items across 2,000 stores as it battles slowing sales growth. "These price reductions are meaningful and recognizable," Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said in an earnings call. "These are the items that will actually drive additional foot traffic into our stores." The strategy follows in the footsteps of Kroger, Trader Joe's, and Walmart, which have also been slashing prices this year. Kroger recently lowered the cost of 1,000 popular grocery items in 120 of its stores, retail consultant David Merrefield writes on industry website The Robin Report. It's also in the process of hiring 14,000 people at its 2,800 stores to boost customer service.  Prior to Kroger's cuts, Trader Joe's quietly dropped its prices and Walmart revealed it was reducing prices on hundreds of items in its grocery department with a particular focus on fresh produce, consumables, and over-the-counter drugs.  Walmart's price cuts are part of a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar investment that Walmart launched in the first quarter of the year.  The grocery price wars are curiously cropping up at the same time that German discount grocer Aldi expands its footprint in the US.  Aldi has about 1,500 stores in the US with plans to open 500 more stores over the next two years as part of a $3 billion expansion. Aldi and rival discounter Lidl have upended the grocery market in the UK in recent years, forcing the nation's largest supermarkets to dramatically cut prices and lay off workers to stay competitive. The CEO of Asda, the UK's second-largest grocery chain, has called the new competitive environment created by Aldi and Lidl "the worst storm in retail history." "When we set the plan, I don't think anyone anticipated the market being in meltdown," Asda CEO Andy Clarke said last year after the Walmart-owned company reported its worst quarterly sales drop ever. In a price check last year, Business Insider found Aldi's prices were roughly 30% lower than Walmart's. Aldi and Lidl are both planning rapid expansions in the US.

Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Aug 25, 2016 at 4:23PM Image Source: Getty. Costco (NASDAQ:COST) not only has tremendous customer loyalty. It also has a reputation for being a good employer. While retail rivals like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT) have suffered through protests over employee wages, Costco has managed to avoid that negative press. That's because the chain has made an effort to be good to its employees, aggressively keeping its wages ahead of industry averages. That pays off in multiple ways for the warehouse club. Higher wages can obviously help attract and retain employees while also encouraging better service for customers. Wal-Mart CFO Brett Biggs even noted during his company's most-recent earnings call that happier workers have partly been responsible for sales increases in the chain's United States stores. We believe a contributing factor to the results is our consistent improvement in customer experience. Customer surveys indicate that we're making good progress in providing a better shopping experience with cleaner stores, faster checkout and friendlier service. Higher-paid workers are happier workers, and while this simple idea perpetually eludes some retailers, Costco has long understood it. Costco has a reputation for being a good employer. Image source: author. Costco has been a wage leader While Wal-Mart and Target deserve credit for their recent large-scale wage increases, Costco has always been a leader when it comes to hourly salaries. The company continued to protect that turf in the first three quarters of its fiscal 2016 by raising hourly rates at both the top and the bottom of its wage scale. CEO Richard Galanti discussed this during the company's third-quarter earnings call.  As I mentioned, our last quarter's -- second quarter's earnings conference call back in March, in addition to the...top of scale increase each year...this year, we also increased our bottom of scale hourly rates in U.S. and Canada, which is about 80% of our company. Effective this past March 14, we increased our starting wage at $1.50 an hour to $13 and $13.50 an hour. Making a change like that does not come cheaply, and Galanti explained the cost during the call. The new bottom of scale wage increase results in a year-over-year incremental payroll expense of about $6 million, or $0.01 a share in the quarter. We estimate that this will be anywhere from $0.01 to $0.02 a quarter in each of the next three quarters depending on which way it rounds. To put the numbers into perspective, Costco's minimum hourly rate is now $13 an hour, while Wal-Mart's average full-time hourly wage is $13.38 an hour, while its average part-time hourly wage is $10.58 an hour, according to Zacks.com. (It's also worth noting that both companies offer health benefits, retirement plans, employee discounts, and other perks with real financial value that are not part of their hourly wages). Costco is playing smart defense Paying workers a little more than your rivals keeps those employees from leaving. That lessens training costs, improves morale, and creates a better overall environment. Satisfied workers directly translate into better sales, as they do a better job taking care of customers. And employees who are in it for the the long haul -- rather than those who are biding their time until they find a better job -- take more pride in their work. In the grand scheme of things, the difference between being a wage leader and skimping on wages is a relatively small number for Costco. By choosing to pay that price long before employees become unhappy with their wages, the company has made a smart move that should continue to pay off for years to come.

On Wednesday, a trader bought 20,000 September 72.50-strike calls for 89 cents, or $89 per options contract. Since each call option accounts for 100 shares of stock, this is a $1.78 million bet that Wal-Mart will rally at least 2 percent in the next few weeks. The hefty trade came amidst an eventful day in the options pit for Wal-Mart, which saw 2.5 times the average daily call volume for its stock. While Dan Nathan of RiskReversal.com is also bullish on Wal-Mart, he does see a potential trouble spot for the retail giant in the next few months. Last October, Wal-Mart's shares tanked following their annual analyst meeting where the company revealed that it expected profits to drop as much as 12 percent in the next year. This year's meeting will be held on October 6, and all eyes will be on Wal-Mart to see if this year will be a repeat. But Nathan believes that traders can actually factor in the analyst meeting, and that the retailer is still a solid bet. "[Wal-Mart is] up 18 percent, that's nearly double the performance of the XRT in 2016," he said Wednesday on CNBC's "Fast Money." "[If] you're looking for possibly some more volatility in the broad market, or potentially as you head into their analyst meeting, you may want to define your risk." "I wouldn't be looking at September, I'd be looking out and I want to capture that analyst meeting and possibly their earnings that are going to happen in mid-November," Nathan added. Wal-Mart is currently down about 2.5 percent this quarter to date.

(Reuters/Rick Wilking) Share Written by Alison Griswold August 25, 2016 Amazon appears to be planning to let US customers order groceries online and pick them up at designated drive-in spots, according to planning documents reviewed by several local news outlets. The e-commerce giant is reportedly testing a “click and collect” model in Sunnyvale, California, a little further up the San Francisco peninsula in San Carlos, and in Seattle, Washington. Online grocery is a notoriously tough business and even Amazon has struggled to crack it. With the drive-in model, Amazon is taking a page from an unlikely player in the space: Walmart. Walmart began testing curbside pickup of online grocery orders for the US in Denver in 2013. This time last year, online grocery pickup was available in five US markets; it has since expanded to nearly 400 stores across more than 60 markets. Pickup is same-day, free for customers, and available from 7am to 11pm local time. Curbside pickup has worked well for Walmart, which has a ready-made storage and distribution network in its more than 4,000 US stores. The service is convenient for customers—Walmart says it takes less than five minutes to drive up and have groceries placed in your car. At no additional cost, it also likely appeals to Walmart’s core shoppers, who tend to be in the mid- or lower-income brackets. “That value proposition is something that has resonated really strongly with our customers,” says Ravi Jariwala, a Walmart spokesman. By having shoppers pick up their groceries at the store, Walmart also eliminates most of the expensive and complicated logistics that have burdened other delivery companies, and which often end up getting passed along to the customer. Instacart, an online grocery startup valued at $2 billion, charges as much as $11.99 for each of its deliveries. Amazon has focused its online grocery efforts thus far on Amazon Fresh, a same- and next-day grocery delivery service it introduced in 2007. Fresh is a competitor to FreshDirect and Peapod, two established US grocery delivery services, as well as startups like Instacart. But nearly a decade after its launch, Fresh is only available in a handful of US cities. And at $299 a year it remains an expensive add-on to Amazon’s flagship Prime membership. Walmart doesn’t break out numbers on its grocery business but Neil Ashe, the company’s outgoing head of global e-commerce, said in June that he expected the grocery segment to contribute “hundreds of basis points” to the US over time. For the quarter ending on July 29, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon pointed to “the continued roll out of online grocery and growth of pick-up in stores” as a key driver of Walmart’s 11.8% increase in e-commerce sales. “We wouldn’t be expanding this as quickly as we have—going from five to now well over 60 [markets], with a view to even further expansion this year—if we weren’t encouraged by the response we were seeing from customers,” Jariwala says. Amazon did not respond to requests for comment. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) The Associated Press A month after Wal-Mart introduced online grocery ordering with curbside pickup at five stores in the St. Louis area, the discount retailer is expanding the service to more stores in the region. The Walmart Supercenter at 2608 Green Mount Commons Drive in Belleville will begin offering curbside pickup Sept. 6. Walmart Supercenter at 2700 Ridge Point Drive in High Ridge and a new smaller-format Walmart Neighborhood Market at 45 Sutters Mill Road in St. Peters will add the service Sept. 19. Wal-Mart introduced its online ordering service with same-day curbside pickup about a year-and-a-half ago but didn’t begin offering it in the St. Louis region until last month, starting with stores in Festus, Collinsville, Arnold, Lake Saint Louis and Washington, Mo. With the free service, customers order and pay online, pull up to specially marked parking spaces on the side of the store and a Walmart employee loads the merchandise into their vehicle. There’s a minimum $30 purchase and only a portion of the retailers’ goods are available for curbside pickup, about 30,000 items. Available merchandise also includes lightbulbs and other goods from throughout the store. +1  Walmart's curbside pickup parking spots at its Arnold store on Aug. 25, 2016, are highlighted with orange signage.

Nicholas Rossolillo (nrossolillo) Aug 25, 2016 at 12:47PM Image source: Wal-Mart. Retail giant Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) reported second-quarter earnings last week and had lots of details for investors to digest. Besides the health of the giant itself, what have we learned from the company's report? 1. Sales growth is stalling (outside of internet sales) Wal-Mart and other traditional retailers have been struggling against internet retail. July's retail sales report showed e-commerce grew by 14% year over year, a trend that has been in force for years now. By comparison, general merchandise stores saw a mere 0.2% year-over-year growth, with department stores showing a 3.9% contraction. Such is the case for Wal-Mart, posting just a 0.5% increase in revenue last quarter. However, Wal-Mart did have solid growth from certain areas, like its new neighborhood market concept. Comparative sales at the small-format grocery-centric stores were up 6.5%, a positive sign that convenient locations and quicker access to shopping could be a winning strategy with consumers. Comparative sales for Wal-Mart as a whole were 1.6%. Other brick-and-mortar retailers have begun to experiment with smaller formats in an attempt to win back market share. Department store chain Kohl's (NYSE: KSS), for example, is rolling out smaller-footprint locations and small specialty stores to see if they gain traction with digitally minded and time-strapped consumers. But don't bet on physical stores being the answer. Wal-Mart is reporting success with its neighborhood market concept, but internet sales growth remains the focus. Revenue generated from the online store is still a small share of the company's total business, even though e-commerce sales were up 11.8% in the quarter. The company has stated numerous times its focus is on fostering growth in that segment, backing those statements up with the recent purchase of online shopper jet.com. Other traditional retailers, and investors in them, should therefore take heed. Growth can still be eked out of physical store formats, but the key to long-term growth lies with internet selling. 2. Retail stocks look like a bargain Wal-Mart's latest quarter was ultimately pretty lackluster, posting flat top-line growth as the retailer struggles to find the answer to fight changing consumer shopping habits. However, the stock popped the day of the earnings release anyway. In an environment where retail has been struggling, any good news whatsoever is refreshing for investors. Throughout second-quarter earnings season, many other retailers have noted difficulties with the business of selling merchandise. Wal-Mart's big-box rival Target (NYSE: TGT) stated discounting was and will continue to be a necessity to keep customers coming in. Even with this situation being the case, Wal-Mart's  report was enough to lift shares as much as 3% the day of the report. The earnings release showed flat sales growth and 8.6% growth in profits coming from falling cost of sales and the sale of the Yihaodian business in China. With the one-time sale item having a big impact on quarterly profits, the report really was just meh. WMT Price data by YCharts. With all of the downbeat news many retailers have endured in the last year, many stocks in the industry look like a bargain. I think Wal-Mart has demonstrated it's time for investors to start researching retailers with an eye for making a purchase. 3. Traffic and comp growth is key Cost-cutting can only carry profit growth so far. Cost of sales during the quarter dropped 0.6% year-over-year, but what Wal-Mart and other merchants really need is traffic and comparable-sales growth to keep up with internet retailers. Wal-Mart in the U.S. posted growth during the quarter in each measure of 1.6% and 1.2%, respectively. This growth came mostly from the aforementioned neighborhood market and e-sales figures, offsetting declines at Wal-Mart's supercenters. The positive momentum is a good sign, but the company will have to do better to stave off Amazon. As mentioned before, Wal-Mart's e-commerce efforts yielded an 11.8% growth rate. But with e-commerce in general averaging 14% growth, the company actually ends up losing market share to the competition. If foot traffic declines can't be offset more aggressively with neighborhood markets and e-commerce, the company will continue to be stagnant. This situation is being mirrored at other retailers. Developing an omnichannel sales model, one that incorporates online and physical store sales, is proving difficult for some big-box and department stores. Investors, if your merchandiser is suffering from this problem, it's time to take a look at other stocks that are having greater success. 4. The pain of being a multinational organization Since the summer of 2014, the U.S. dollar has gained in value against most other global currencies. This situation is weighing on profits of U.S.-based multinational corporations, Wal-Mart included. ^DBLUSD data by YCharts. When Wal-Mart sells goods in another country, it collects payment in that country's currency. When the company brings the proceeds back to U.S., it has to convert them  to dollars. If the dollar has strengthened against the other country, the value of the money collected drops. Because of this situation, Wal-Mart and other businesses that operate in multiple countries have seen profits affected. For the retail titan, revenue was negatively impacted by $2.7 billion dollars in the quarter, representing a 2.2% hit on the top line. It has been a tough two-year stretch for big corporations dealing with currency issues, but some respite might be in store with the recent pullback in the dollar. Even with the recent decline, though, the dollar is riding high. Nicholas Rossolillo owns shares of Target. The Motley Fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

My big thank yous to the Maine state troopers, local sheriff’s department, Newport police, Wal-Mart staff and management, Dunkin’ Donuts staff, first responders and anyone that I may have left out of this. With all the craziness in this world today it was wonderful that the whole situation was taken care of with no shots fired. They were able to talk to a distressed, armed man and bring everything to an end, and send the man off for the help he obviously needed. My friend Kathy and I went in to Wal-mart just before 10 a.m., we were in there for four things. Got right in there, found the things we wanted and were ready to head out. We were headed for the cashiers when a man said, “No need to hurry ladies, we are now on lock down”. Lock down!!!!! You’re kidding, but looking at the people milling around the doors told us he was telling the truth. Soooo, what to do, so we walked around and the cart grew from four things to a cart load! Someone made the crack that maybe this was Wal-mart’s new marketing plan! I saw a man coming down an aisle with a flat loaded with chairs, didn’t take long to figure out this was going to be a while. So we went to Dunkin’ Donuts for some lunch. They were doing their part of passing out goodies to folks, too. Most everyone we saw seemed to be trying to make the best out of a bad situation. You have to know no one planned on all that time in there. The staff went around with a cart with water and crackers. Someone else was passing out crayons and paper to the children. How people handle others in strange situations is always of interest to me. I was quite impressed with all the professionalism of all involved. “Bless his heart,” there was one man in there that had left his dog in the car for a short trip into the store. Needless to say three hours later he is upset. It was towards the end of the ordeal the troopers took him out to bring in the dog and got him water. Kathy and I were feeling bad because that could have been us. Every other day last week we had Toby, her dachshund, with us. Guess we learned an important lesson. Sometimes things just don’t go as planned. And believe it or not, after spending three hours in Wal-mart on Friday, I still have to go back to do our real grocery shopping. However, I think I will head for Waterville this week. I’m just curious if we ever show people our true gratitude. Contact me at dwdaffy@yahoo.com. Sub line: Thank you. Thank you and looking forward to hearing from you!

Best Buy reported better-than-expected numbers this past week and the stock spiked as short-term sentiment improved. While this certainly is a ray of sunshine for this beleaguered retail stock, Best Buy in the long-run, will not be able to overcome the headwinds of agile competitors with lower cost structures. Toys R Us, a dominant brand, was crushed by the online presence of distributors combined with the scale of Wal-Mart. Egghead Software made a proactive decision to eliminate brick-and-mortar stores and move towards online sales. Circuit City, Good Guys and CompUSA all were crushed as margins compressed based on increasing online competition. Best Buy was the beneficiary of the problems that each of these companies faced which allowed it to carve off significant brick-and-mortar market share. Still, despite market gains, there is no disputing the erosion of profit that occurs when just-in-time delivery web access solutions provide the same product at lower cost. Even Wal-Mart, with its purchase of Jet.com, recognizes that in order to compete with Amazon and other online retailers, it must have a significant presence in the online space. This is Walmart we are talking about which has the most scale of virtually any company in the United States and even THEY needed to take drastic action to blunt the impact of online stores. Best Buy is a popular choice when you wish to test out an item, see it live and in person, need it same day, and are looking for some degree of human interaction. But despite the brick-and-mortar advantage, how many times have you noticed someone at Best Buy on their smart phone looking to see whether or not Best Buy is charging the lowest price? And given that Best Buy has a price match guarantee for any web retailer, doesn't it make sense that their margins will be crushed given they have much higher overhead costs then online retailers? There are 4 basic reasons Best Buy faces major headwinds despite its valiant efforts to remain relevant in today's web-enabled marketplace: Margin compression: As Best Buy matches prices and attempts to be competitive with a higher cost structure, there is simply no way it can stem the erosion of profit as online retailers have a significantly leaner cost structure. Service revenue won't fix the problem: The service business promoted by Best Buy is a higher profit center enterprise but we do not see its potential to be significant enough to offset the erosion of profit margins as it continues to operate as a brick-and-mortar chain. Online retailers are moving downstream: Online competitors are beginning to develop brick-and-mortar solutions for product delivery. Amazon, for example, already has a network of delivery lockers for consumers looking for same-day delivery, purchasers of products without permanent addresses, buyers of goods traveling out of town. Online will be the core with modified brick-and-mortar solutions available to compete on a local basis. This is a much different cost structure than brick-and-mortar as the core and online as an add on. Same-day delivery services will continue to increase as Amazon and other online retailers work to increase the efficiency of their distribution network. Already in some communities Amazon offers same-day delivery. We expect an increase in delivery efficiency through the use of logistics and other technology solutions. This is not to say that Best Buy is ultimately moving in the direction of Good Guys or Circuit City; there needs to be a competitor in the marketplace for those wishing to touch and feel a device prior to purchase. But as a lesson to be learned, investors should look and see what happened to the book space: Borders is out of business and Barnes & Noble has been closing stores. There is no reason to believe that Best Buy will avoid the same fate that bookstores fell prey to over the course of the last 10 years. I'm not saying Best Buy will declare bankruptcy but it's going to have a smaller footprint with less retail impact. One last thought to consider. When Webvan emerged in the spring of 1999, pundits talked about grocery as the next great conquest for online sales. Obviously with the demise of Webvan that turned out not to be the case as consumers wanted to touch and feel the product. But I would contend that buying groceries is far different than buying a computer. The book seller comparison is much more appropriate. The stock investment game is really one of time horizon. On the short-term there were some positive signs for Best Buy and that is why the stock popped. But if one looks below the surface to look at trend lines and the oncoming march of online retailers towards becoming the alternative to brick-and-mortar solutions, it's hard to see why Best Buy should be a part of one's core long-term portfolio strategy. The competition is fierce and the world is moving online. While there will be a need for a smaller scale Best Buy footprint, the future for this company will likely look much different that today's current market position. The reasonable inevitable conclusion for this company will be that this enterprise will be smaller and less profitable; I just don't see any other outcome. Commentary by Michael A.

Sales increased 8.7% to R42bn. Weaker economic growth and the effect of the weaker rand on the price of imports “severely constrained consumers’ discretionary spending on durable goods,” the company said. Food and liquor sales growth accelerated with factors including and lower pricing than competitors, it said. South African retailers have wrestled this year with challenges including weak domestic consumer confidence and rising interest rates, as economic growth stalls. "We anticipate that this situation will make trading for the remainder of 2016 difficult," Massmart said. Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas and the world’s largest retailer, bought a controlling stake in Massmart in 2011 to take advantage of African growth.

Events Close ESTHER CEPEDA: One person's clutter could be another person's treasure Aug 25, 2016 (…) CHICAGO -- In a recent op-ed piece, Stephanie Land characterized the de-cluttering craze, popularized by Marie Kondo's best-selling "The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up," as a form of class-based scorn. "In a new documentary about the movement, 'bad' consumption is portrayed by masses of people swarming into big-box stores on Black Friday, rushing over one another for the best deals," wrote Land, a fellow at the Center for Community Change, in The New York Times. "They are, we're led to understand, slaves to material goods, whereas the people who stay away from mass consumption are independent thinkers, free to enjoy the higher planes of life. But those people flocking to Wal-Mart ... are people teetering on or even below the poverty level, desperate for comfort in their homes. To point to them as a reason to start an anti-consumerism movement is just another form of social shaming." I agree -- there's a lot of hype tinged with snobbery. The minimalism movement has become what Kyle Chayka calls "Silicon Valley's version of Zen monkhood." Writing in The New York Times Magazine, Chayka nailed Land's discomfort: "Minimalism is now conflated with self-optimization. ... The movement, such as it is, is led in large part by a group of men who gleefully ditch their possessions as if to disavow the advantages by which they obtained them. But it takes a lot to be minimalist: social capital, a safety net and access to the internet." Still, as someone who lives in an area where the Wal-Mart is only a mile from the local Goodwill thrift store, I have a very different take on it: Kondo's approach may be a conceit of the upper class, but it has undoubtedly enriched the lives of all the working-class people who are lucky enough to live near high-quality second-hand-goods stores. From the perspective of someone who has been going to Goodwill every Saturday morning since my local store opened in 2011, Kondo's "Life-Changing Magic" has brought a lot of high-priced glee to a neighborhood whose poverty rate reached almost 21 percent in the years after the Great Recession. What this means for a low-income family with school-aged children is that when back-to-school time comes around, a mom can usually find new, often-times very high-quality name-brand clothes and shoes -- plus extremely cheap, practically new school supplies like scissors, loose-leaf notebook paper, folders, rulers and required paperbacks like "To Kill a Mockingbird" or "The Great Gatsby" -- for pennies on the dollar. These families then take the savings from having purchased donated goods down the street to Wal-Mart for the licensed-cartoon-character brand lunchboxes, backpacks and other supplies the kids simply can't do without for the start of school. Plus, some of the nation's top thrift store chains do more than just offer super-nice goods on the cheap. The Salvation Army, for instance, funds adult rehabilitation centers and programs that help people re-enter society and attain gainful employment in part through profits from the donated goods that are resold in their thrift stores. According to Charlene Sarmiento, the public relations program manager at Goodwill Industries International, people's donations help fund programs that educate and train veterans and military families, older workers and others entering the job market. The stores and associated programs provide real work experience and career counseling, computer classes, resume reviews, job interview training and specialized industry education to get people into jobs in their communities. Last year, Sarmiento said, "Goodwill placed 312,000 people in employment in the U.S. and Canada and nearly 2 million people worked to build their career and financial assets by engaging with Goodwill team members. In addition, more than 35 million people used computers and mobile devices to access Goodwill education, training, mentoring and online learning services to strengthen their skills." Sarmiento could not make a direct connection between the Kondo craze, which started after the book was published in the United States in 2014, and Goodwill's 4 to 7 percent increase in donations over the past two years but said, "We know that Kondo's book has been very popular and we encourage people who are de-cluttering to donate the items they no longer need to Goodwill. ... Many of our friends, family members and neighbors have been able to find jobs and care for their families through your donations to Goodwill." De-cluttering doesn't have to be a vapid exercise in conspicuous austerity. Clean house and help others at the same time by donating to your local nonprofit thrift store.

Appeals court upholds Walmart EIR; project can move forward By Jill Barnes Nelson, Tehachapi News Aug 24, 2016 City of Tehachapi An artist's rendition of the proposed Tehachapi Walmart. Walmart once again looks to be a go in Tehachapi. The Fifth District Court of Appeal in Fresno announced Wednesday afternoon, Aug. 24, that the City of Tehachapi has adequately addressed environmental issues related to the project. The vote of the three-panel judge was unanimous.  A hearing on the matter was held July 26 and it was widely expected the decision would take about a month to come down from the court.  “It’s our understanding the City and Walmart have prevailed in the appeals court,” City Manager Greg Garrett said just after the decision became public. “The appeal process is not yet completed but we’re happy that this long legal back and forth may soon be over.” Mayor Susan Wiggins also was happy the appeal process could be at an end. “I’m really happy to hear this,” Wiggins said by phone. “I listened to both sides and also from 350 senior citizens who said they needed the Walmart. They said didn’t want to drive to Bakersfield any more to get lower prices on the things they need. I’m glad to hear that this is over, unless they can appeal again.” The drive to stop the Walmart project had been brought before the court twice in the past by a group called Tehachapi First, which cited environmental concerns. The last time Tehachapi First went to court was in July 2015 after Kern County Superior Court Judge Kenneth Twisselman ruled that the City of Tehachapi had adequately addressed environmental concerns related to the project. Tehachapi First emerged as an organization after the city approved Walmart in 2011. Through its attorney, Mark Wolfe of San Francisco, the organization has challenged the adequacy of environmental reviews related to the proposed Walmart. If allowed to move forward, the 165,000-square-foot Walmart super center would be built on property the company owns near the southeast corner of Tucker Road and Tehachapi Boulevard. Tehachapi First initially appealed the Tehachapi Planning Commission’s approval of the Walmart project in January 2011. The latest report from the court hearing said the city will recover all its costs for the appeal.

Could Jet.com be any different? Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Aug 24, 2016 at 6:11PM Image Source: Wal-Mart. In 2010, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) acquired Vudu, a "leading provider" of video streaming technology. At the time, Wal-Mart called Vudu a "revolutionary service" that had licensing agreements with every major studio that allowed its streaming customers to rent or purchase as many as 16,000 movies. This was at the dawn of streaming, before Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) had split its own streaming service from its DVD-by-mail-plan and before Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) made its own significant push into streaming by bundling its video service with its Prime membership program. Analysts suspected the move could help Wal-Mart sell more internet-connected TV's, but it was not the retailer's first attempt to break into the entertainment market. In 2004, the company launched its own digital music download store, which flopped, and in 2007 it started a similar video download service with Hewlett-Packard, but that was gone within a year. Unlike Amazon Video or Netflix, Vudu hasn't gone on to bigger things in the streaming arena, despite the backing of the world's largest retailer. Wal-Mart only spent a little more than $100 million on the service, but it arguably could have been a tentpole similar to Amazon's on video service in its Prime membership. Instead, the service is an afterthought, barely worth a mention in Wal-Mart's 10-K report. Unlike Netflix, Amazon, or Hulu, Vudu offers no monthly subscription, making it a poor value when single movie rentals cost as much as $6. (Mis)adventures in China In 2011, Wal-Mart invested in Yihaodian, a fast-growing Chinese e-commerce business. Like many American companies, Wal-Mart saw the opportunity in China, predicting that e-commerce sales in that country would overtake those in the U.S. within a few years. Over the years, Wal-Mart upped its stake in Yihaodian, taking majority ownership in 2012 and eventually taking over the entire company last year. Less than a year after it took full control of Yihaodian, Wal-Mart sold it to JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) this past June. Wal-Mart received a 5% stake in JD.com, which was roughly $1.5 billion at the time of the sale, close to Yihaodian's valuation last year when Wal-Mart bought the remaining 49% of it. While the deal gives Wal-Mart a stake in one of China's biggest e-commerce players and it will provide for Wal-Mart's namesake brand and Sam's Club, it was seen by most analysts as giving up on the competitive Chinese market that is often difficult for American companies to penetrate. More broadly, Wal-Mart's traffic in Chinese stores has fallen for several quarters in a row. While Yihaodian's sale to JD doesn't represent a failure in and of itself, it does seem that Wal-Mart's original strategy with that business did not pan out. Similarly, WalmartLabs, the company's tech division located in Silicon Valley has had mixed result despite making 15 acquisitions in its history. With Jet.com, Wal-Mart is making its bet on e-commerce growth through another company, spending $3.3 billion. This tidy sum is the biggest amount spent, ever, to acquire an e-commerce business. And it is being spent on a company that has existed for less than a year.  By acquiring Jet, Walmart  gains technology and an appealing algorithm. It also gets the brain of Marc Lore, the founder who had previously started Quidsi, the parent of Diapers.com, a company that Wal-Mart coveted but Amazon ultimately bought. However, even before the acquisition, there were signs that such a partnership might not work out, and get saddled by the same bureaucracy that have troubled the company's other acquisitions. Discussing his own company and the pattern of other tech founders leaving Wal-Mart shortly after their company is acquired, he said in January, "If someone is unhappy here and doesn't see an opportunity for growth, OK, good luck, go to Wal-Mart. I want to prove to myself that a different kind of culture can work and that you don't have to be like that to be successful." Lore committed to run Wal-Mart's e-commerce division for five years, an unusually long time, and he would forfeit millions of dollars by quitting early. The question for Wal-Mart now is if it's willing to let its online division be run like a disruptive start-up even if that could mean undermining its own retail empire. The answer this question will likely determine the fate of Jet.com as part of WMT's empire. Unfortunately, if history is any guide, invests shouldn't hold their breath.  Jeremy Bowman owns shares of Netflix. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Amazon.com and Netflix.

Ibrahim Nathaniel Muhammad, 20, was charged with murder in the death of Rechard Delane Mickle. Kedar Aziz Muhammad, 22, was also charged with murder in Mickle's death. RELATED: Man charged with murder in Charlotte Walmart parking lot shooting Saturday, Charlotte-Mecklenburg police were called to the Walmart in the 8100 block of South Tryon Street at 9 p.m. in reference to a shooting. When officers arrived, they reportedly only found an abandoned vehicle. At that point, no one had been taken to area hospitals. A few hours later, Mount Holly police called CMPD and said a man, later identified as Mickle, had been dropped off at CaroMont Regional Medical Center with gunshot wounds. He was pronounced dead at the hospital. Police said evidence led them to believe Mickle was shot in the Walmart parking lot hours before. Anyone with further information about the incident is asked to call 704-432-TIPS, or Crime Stoppers at 704-334-1600. Copyright 2016 WBTV. All rights reserved.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:30 AM, August 25, 2016 Updated: 6:10 AM, August 25, 2016 NEW YORK - A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday said cash-strapped Puerto Rico cannot force Wal-Mart Stores Inc's <WMT.N> affiliate on the island to pay a special corporate tax that the retailer claimed was discriminatory and violated the U.S. Constitution. The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston upheld a lower court order blocking Puerto Rico from imposing its alternative minimum tax against Wal-Mart Puerto Rico Inc. The decision complicates the U.S. territory's efforts to reduce a $70 billion debt load and restart an economy that has been stalled for a decade with a 45 percent poverty rate. The 2015 tax legislation had raised to 6.5 percent from 2.0 percent the tax for on-island companies with more than $2.75 billion in revenues that buy goods from off-island "related parties." Wal-Mart argued it was the only company that fit that description and effectively taxed on items from its own distribution centers but not those bought from Puerto Rican vendors. A federal court in Puerto Rico sided with Wal-Mart in March. On Wednesday, the appeals panel called the tax "facially discriminatory," saying it taxes only cross-border transactions between a Puerto Rico corporate taxpayer and a related entity located elsewhere. This violated the so-called "dormant" Commerce Clause in the constitution, the court ruled. "Because we want to remain in business in Puerto Rico and to be part of the solution to the current fiscal crisis, we are grateful that the First Circuit affirmed the District Court’s decision to strike down this unconstitutional tax," Lorenzo Lopez, a Wal-Mart spokesman said in a statement emailed to Reuters. Puerto Rico's financial problems, spurred by years of borrowing to try to combat economic stagnation, reached a crisis in recent months, as cash reserves dwindled and the island's own fiscal agent, the Government Development Bank, faced insolvency. In July, the territory defaulted on $779 million of its most senior debt. The appeals court admitted Puerto Rico is in "dire financial straits," but called the tax "blunt and unnecessarily over-inclusive." "It essentially establishes an irrebuttable presumption that all inter-corporate transfers to a Puerto Rico branch from related mainland entities are fraudulently priced to evade taxes," the court reasoned. The island's outgoing governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, has called Puerto Rico's financial situation a "humanitarian crisis," while U.S. Congress earlier this year passed legislation bringing the island's finances under a federal oversight board. Board members are expected to be appointed in September. Among the board's powers is the ability to force talks between the island and its creditors to negotiate cuts to Puerto Rico's debt.

Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next NASHVILLE, Tenn. - Police say they have recovered marijuana plants growing behind a local Walmart. Four weed plants were found in the woods behind the Walmart in the 3400 block of Dickerson Pike. Officials could be seen coming from the tree line with the plants after removing them. According to police, a team of contractors found them while working in the field. A security guard with them was also a former police officer. He recognized the plants were marijuana and contacted police. Some Walmart employees said they've seen kids in the field before. The Metro Nashville Police Department sent an aviation team to check for a massive grow operation from the air. So far, authorities said they've only found four plants, and no arrests have been made.

Markowski, 58, appears for his preliminary hearing on Wednesday. He is accused of shooting at a state trooper after robbing the Shrewsbury Walmart. (Steve Marroni/PennLive) Print Email Steve Marroni | smarroni@pennlive.com By Steve Marroni | smarroni@pennlive.com The Patriot-News Email the author | Follow on Twitter on August 24, 2016 at 4:11 PM, updated August 24, 2016 at 4:38 PM comments NEW FREEDOM – "He doesn't need a prescription," Terry Lee White told the pharmacist as she rushed to the back of the store. "He has a gun." She likely thought she'd never utter that sentence, especially in reference to a regular customer at the Shrewsbury Walmart, but she testified on Wednesday that's what happened when Thomas A. Markowski, 58, came up to her pharmacy window on April 7.   Thomas A. Markowski. York County Prison.   All charges have been bound over to York County Court after a preliminary hearing Wednesday for Markowski, whom police say used a sawed-off shotgun to rob the Walmart pharmacy of Fentanyl before shooting at a state trooper on his way out. According to testimony at Wednesday's hearing in New Freedom, the incident occurred like this: White was working at the Shrewsbury Walmart's pharmacy counter when Markowski, who was riding one of the store's motorized carts, came up to the window. It seemed like he was struggling, and he told her, "I'm dying" and "I need my Fentanyl patches." When she asked for his prescription, he told her he had a gun. Walmart robbery suspect accused of shooting at state trooper appears in court "He said I have 10 seconds to retrieve the Fentanyl," White testified. As she went back to talk to the pharmacist, a cashier, Stuart Wiener, heard the commotion and called 911. Markowski stuck his arm behind the counter, telling White she was moving too slowly, and started counting down from five. As she went back to the counter with the patches, she saw he was holding what appeared to be a sawed-off shotgun inside a black garbage bag. She gave him four boxes of Fentanyl and said, "now go." He got up from the motorized cart and started to walk out of the store. Meanwhile, Pennsylvania State Police Trooper Darrio Parham happened to be in his cruiser, parked at the Walmart, grabbing a bite to eat. It's customary for troopers to park there sometimes as a deterrent to potential shoplifters, he said.  Parham had only been on the job for about five months at that point when the 911 call came through.  At first, Parham thought the suspect had a knife, and he walked to the front of the store as Markowski was coming out, carrying the shotgun. "He was pointing it straight at me," Parham testified. Wiener was there, too, and he said Markowski was telling them to get out of his way.   As Markowski approached, Parham grabbed the shotgun, which went off. It was unclear if it was an accidental discharge or if Markowski intended to fire at the officer, but Parham drew his gun and shot Markowski in the chest. The shotgun blast hit the wall about 6-feet above Wiener's head. Senior Judge Nancy Lee Edie found there was enough evidence to send all charges against Markowski to York County Court, where he is set for arraignment on Sept. 30. He's facing charges of criminal attempt at the murder of a law enforcement officer, robbery, theft, possession of a weapon, recklessly endangering another person, assault of a law enforcement officer and two counts of aggravated assault. But even after the hearing, one question still remained – who is Thomas Markowski? "That's the thing, we don't know," York County Chief Deputy Prosecutor David Sunday said. It's not even clear where he lived. In requesting bail, Markowski's attorney, Ron Jackson, only had a partial Annapolis, Maryland address, as well as an address at a farm in another part of Maryland. Markowski is listed as living in York in charging documents, but he told the court he lived in Maryland all his life. The judge granted Markowski $2 million bail.  But there are still a lot of unknowns about what happened, who he is, and what led to the incident. Sunday said it's not even clear, at this point, if he has a terminal illness, as he had told the pharmacy tech.  PENNLIVE ON SOCIAL MEDIA Facebook Twitter Instagram Pinterest Tumblr Most Read Active Discussions Get 'Today's Front Page' in your inbox This newsletter is sent every morning at 6 a.m. and includes the morning's top stories, a full list of obituaries, links to comics and puzzles and the most recent news, sports and entertainment headlines.

The real estate at 100 stores is now worth more to shareholders than selling suits, shoes and perfume. Those are just the two latest store-closure standouts in an industry where digital, new competition and shoppers’ changing tastes are making life hard. Sports Authority is going out of business, shutting everything down fast. Teen clothing store Aeropostale filed Chapter 11 and is closing hundreds of stores. Walmart specifically realizes it’s a race to meet consumers online: web, mobile, Amazon Echo — whatever and wherever the shoppers are.  But Amazon keeps eating away at Walmart’s base and its physical stores are losing steam. Earlier this year, the retailer said it would close 250 stores. After the Jet.com deal, the Economist reported, “Walmart still accounts for a tenth of American retail sales, but that has declined from 11.6 percent in 2009, according to Cowen Group, a financial-services firm.” Pinpointing the Problem When organizations fall behind digitally, the problem is often largely an organizational one, with some technology issues thrown into the mix, too.  Many companies — and their leadership — still live in a Kodachrome world where they control the conversation, dominate the market and set the trends. That legacy mindset can kill a company today. And when retailers wait too long to embrace digital transformation, once reality sets in, it’s hard to scrape your way back to customers’ hearts and minds. To understand the pattern here, just look at the newspaper industry.  For years, newspapers enjoyed consistent growth, high profits and near-monopolies in local markets for news and advertising. Then, industry leaders failed to recognize the web’s position as a force that would disrupt, and ultimately destroy, their old business model. I spent seven years in the newspaper business and was there the day the web showed up. Papers have been looking for their silver bullet ever since. Digital disruption is also happening in cable television, where customers are cutting the cord in favor of Netflix, Hulu and other less costly, more appealing subscriptions. TV isn’t as bad off as newspapers, but it’s on its way. Customers Are One Step Ahead Today’s customers are in control of your business — not the other way around — and the digital-induced threat is more prevalent than ever. It doesn’t matter if you’re in financial services, media and entertainment, or even higher education: customers are shifting their actions toward digital more rapidly than most of us ever expected. All these years after the web came onto the scene, too few organizations are truly, radically geared to move as fast as their customers, who are changing behaviors and transitioning their purchase power to an online world. And too many organizational leaders are telling their investors and boards that they’ve been doing the right things — that the business’ approach to digital is under control when the tail has been wagging the dog for a long time. The reality is, websites and mobile apps built only two years ago are just scratching the surface of digital customer engagement. They don’t account for things like social media engagement, digital signage, real-time notifications and proactive alerts that present an offer, update relevant information and news, or predict a customer’s next purchase. Lessons from the Leaders When it comes to digital disruption and digital customer experience, leading C-level executives are starting to take notice. Forward-thinking organizations are investing in tools, technology and strategy to get ahead and stay in the game: Hotel chains like Starwood are learning that great digital customer experiences, efficient online booking engines and phone apps that can unlock your hotel room door generate loyalty and more revenue per room Online banks like Chime and Simple that cater to the digital and mobile-savvy set are seeing millennials flocking to open accounts, invest their money and obtain loans Disruptive CPG brands, like digital direct-to-consumer Dollar Shave Club, used lower prices and great customer service to build a massive customer base that loved their products. Consumer goods giant Unilever loved it so much — and realized it could not replicate Dollar Shave Club’s success easily — that it recently paid $1 billion for the company Digital Is Just Business Digital has created a whole new world and a whole new level of expectations. Organizations require vision and permission from executives and boards of directors to try new approaches and take a few risks. They need funding to build in the right capabilities for ongoing digital innovation to win, serve and retain customers. Now, more than ever, getting that support is well worth the uphill battle. Digital isn’t just a fad. Digital business is now just “business.”  Organizations that realize this and build a strategy and digital technology platform to keep up with customers and stakeholders have a fighting chance when that disruptive competitor shows up on the scene.  Customers’ changing habits can move mountains. It’s time we learn to anticipate those moves and be ready when they show up, expecting the best from their digital experience.

Those transactions follow $104 million of sales at the end of June at prices between $70.67 and $71.86. Shares of the retailer have climbed this year after closing at a four-year low of $56.42 in November. Seventy-seven percent of analysts tracked by Bloomberg have a hold rating on the stock, with an average 12-month price target of $73.68. Walton Enterprises LLC, the family’s main investment entity, distributed about 6 percent of the shares to the trust in April 2015. The family said in a statement that it expects to sell shares from time to time to help fund charitable contributions and offset possible further increases in its ownership percentage as a result of the company’s stock buyback programs. The trust now owns about 170 million shares of the business, the filings show. That’s a fraction of the 1.4 billion shares held by Walton Enterprises. Together the two entities own 51 percent of the retailer. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart and the Walton family directed Bloomberg to the April 2015 statement.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Walmart is 'going on the offensive' as growing threat Kroger slashes prices and hires thousands of workers Wednesday Aug 24, 2016 at 12:03 PM Ashley Lutz Business Insider Kroger is slashing prices and going on a hiring spree.  The grocery store chain recently cut the cost of 1,000 popular items in 120 of its stores, retail consultant David Merrefield writes on industry website The Robin Report. It's also in the process of hiring 14,000 people at its 2,800 stores to boost customer service.  Kroger has annual sales of $115 billion, about half of Walmart's US sales. Still, the retail giant is starting to pay attention.  Walmart is reacting to Kroger's success by investing more heavily in its grocery experience, the Cincinnati Business Courier reports.

Penney, Bed, Bath and Beyond and Walmart start investigating Indian firm after Target cuts ties Written by Madhura Karnik August 24, 2016 Quartz india Are those sheets you bought? (Reuters/Natalie Behring) Share Written by Madhura Karnik August 24, 2016 Quartz india For textile maker Welspun India, it’s been a tough few days–and they will likely get tougher. Shares of the Mumbai, India, firm have dropped 43% in the last seven days on the BSE after American retailer Target said it would drop the firm as a supplier because the Indian company substituted cheap cotton for 100% Egyptian cotton in sheets shipped under the Fieldcrest label. Now US retailers J.C. Penney, Bed, Bath and Beyond, and Walmart say they are investigating products supplied by the firm. New investigations “JCPenney is conducting a thorough investigation of its Welspun textiles to ensure the integrity of its product claims. It is too early in our review process to determine what actions may be necessary,” Carter English, a spokesperson for J.C. Penney, said in an email. Bed, Bath and Beyond, which is Welspun India’s biggest customer, has also initiated a review. “Welspun has reaffirmed to us that the Welspun product carried in our stores is Egyptian cotton. To further assure ourselves and our customers, we have engaged an independent third party to perform an audit of the supply chain to confirm this information,” said spokesperson Leah Drill in an email. Walmart told The Wall Street Journal that it is “reviewing” Welspun India’s certification records. Walmart hasn’t replied to an inquiry from Quartz. Macy’s, the American department-store chain, is also closely watching. “Welspun does produce some of Macy’s private brand products, but they are not 100% Egyptian cotton. Of course, we continue to monitor the situation,” Jim Sluzewski, a Macy’s spokesperson, said in an email. Some customers such as Swedish retailer Ikea aren’t discontinuing business with Welspun but are on alert. Ikea told Reuters that Welspun India is a supplier, and it hasn’t any issue with the quality. Ikea will monitor the situation, too. Analysts worry These retailers are critical for Welspun India. The Egyptian cotton sheets business accounts for about 6% of revenue at Welspun India, according to Elara Capital, a brokerage. One of the biggest textile makers in India, the firm gets 95% of its revenue from exports. Welspun India said it has commissioned an audit, but analysts said the company did not provide many details during a call on Aug. 23. The call “was vague on facts and threw up more questions than answers,” analysts at Elara wrote in a note. “(Welspun’s) management failed to assuage concerns on how Target’s internal audit and third-party quality checks appointed by it failed to raise any alarms over a period of two years,” analysts Sumant Kumar and Anuja Barve wrote. They also estimate that Welspun India might have to pay a one-time penalty of between 1% and 2% of its total revenue. Elara has downgraded its rating on the stock to “sell.” Here’s the movement of Welspun India’s share price during the last week. Welspun hasn’t replied to an email seeking details from Quartz.

Posted 9:54 AM, August 24, 2016, by Tracy Bloom, Updated at 11:07pm, September 23, 2016 Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Pinterest Email A registered sex offender was arrested after allegedly taking cellphone video of a 10-year-old girl as she used the restroom inside a Walmart store in unincorporated El Cajon, the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department said Tuesday. The San Diego County Sheriff’s Department has released this booking photo of Robert Becker. The young victim told deputies a man followed her into the women’s bathroom last Wednesday at the Walmart located at 13487 Camino Canada, a sheriff’s news release stated. He then went into the stall next to her, took out his cellphone and used it to record her as he made lewd comments, the girl said, according to the release. The suspect, identified by the Sheriff’s Department as 21-year-old Robert Becker, left before deputies arrived. Investigators looked through the store’s surveillance video to identify him; Becker was arrested Monday at his Alpine home in the 4000 block of Alpine Boulevard, according to the release. His previous offense was described as possessing and controlling obscene matter depicting a minor in sexual conduct, according to his entry on the Megan’s Law website. The victims were under the age of 12 and authorities found more than 600 images. In the latest case, he faced charges of attempted lewd and lascivious acts on a minor, annoying or molesting a child with a prior conviction and disorderly lewd conduct. Becker possibly committed similar crimes in East County, prompting authorities to look for additional victims. Anyone with information about the case, and those who believe they have been victimized by Becker, are urged to call the department at 858-974-2417. Anonymous tips can also be left through Crime Stoppers by dialing 888-580-8477. 32.794773 -116.962527 Filed in: Local News Topics: Robert Becker, San Diego County Sheriff's Department, Walmart Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Pinterest Email Watch KTLA 5 News Every newscast plus replays streamed online Popular Pregnant Woman Fatally Stabbed During Fight in Venice; 3 Attackers Sought Parent Says Tennessee School Bus Driver Asked Kids If They Were ‘Ready to Die’: Report Heartbreaking Video Shows Teacher Snatching Mic Away From West Virginia Boy With Autism at School Play New Federal Overtime Law Takes Effect Dec. 1, Will Impact Millions of U.S. Workers Latest News John C.

 Kroger is taking drastic measures to slash prices — and Walmart should be terrified Ashley Lutz Aug. 24, 2016, 1:00 PM 7,143 facebook linkedin twitter email print Business Insider Kroger is slashing prices and going on a hiring spree.  The grocery store chain recently cut the cost of 1,000 popular items in 120 of its stores, retail consultant David Merrefield writes on industry website The Robin Report. It's also in the process of hiring 14,000 people at its 2,800 stores to boost customer service.  Kroger has annual sales of $115 billion, about half of Walmart's US sales. Still, the retail giant is starting to pay attention.  Walmart is reacting to Kroger's success by investing more heavily in its grocery experience, the Cincinnati Business Courier reports. Walmart is now expanding grocery ordering and pick-up similar to Kroger's popular "Clicklist" service.  "Walmart is going on the offensive," Jim Hagerty, a principal and investment adviser with money management firm Bartlett & Co., told the Business Courier.  Kroger has stores in 35 states, making it Walmart's top grocery store competitor. Lately, Kroger's executives have been focused on offering more private-label products and cutting unpopular items so they can slash prices and hire more people.  AP "Kroger has been able to come close enough to Walmart’s pricing structure to remain competitive, outperforming any of its industry peers," Merrefield writes. The grocery chain has posted same-store sales gains for the past 50 consecutive quarters.  In addition to cutting prices and shoring up the staff, Kroger is also stocking up on organic food and building stores to rival Whole Foods.  The Kroger Marketplace concept features anything you would find in a Walmart or Target store, but also includes gourmet and prepared foods and alcohol similar to a Whole Foods store.  Business Insider recently toured a Kroger Marketplace store and found customizable gourmet pizzas and craft beers on tap.  SEE ALSO: Kroger has a new plan that should terrify Walmart and Target Follow Us: On Facebook NOW WATCH: JACK DANIEL’S MASTER DISTILLER: This is the real difference between scotch, whiskey, and bourbon Loading video...

(WMT) Turnaround Strategy Starting to Work WMT doesn't have to beat AMZN to thrive By Wayne Duggan, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Aug 24, 2016, 12:24 pm EST     Popular Posts: 3 Dividend Stocks to Buy No Matter What the Fed Does Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Quietly Set Itself Up for a HUGE Q4 3 Trump Stocks That Are All Trumped Out Recent Posts: 3 High-Dividend Stocks for 2017 and Beyond 3 Trump Stocks That Are All Trumped Out 3 Dividend Stocks to Buy No Matter What the Fed Does View All Posts A year ago, it seemed like Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) might end up just another victim of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s e-commerce dominance. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr However, as WMT’s second-quarter earnings report revealed, Walmart may not have to beat AMZN to thrive. Second Place Good Enough For WMT While there’s no denying the secular retail shift to e-commerce, AMZN isn’t necessarily the grim reaper for all traditional retailers. Walmart seems to be a perfect example. 7 Best Dividend Stocks You Haven’t Heard Of Other retailers like Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), Macy’s Inc (NYSE:M) and Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS) are clearly struggling to figure out how to compete with AMZN. However, WMT just delivered positive overall sales growth, 3% U.S. sales growth, 1.6% same-store sales growth and 12% EPS growth. That is certainly not the kind of quarter you’d expect from a dying company. WMT stock is also trading near its 52-week high. Let’s be clear — Walmart is not beating Amazon. But that’s OK. “No one catches Amazon online,” Moody’s analyst Charlie O’Shea says. “The key is to be No. 2.” WMT’s online sales growth numbers were nowhere near AMZN’s numbers, but WMT still reported 11.8% digital sales growth in Q2. WMT Turning The Corner? One of the most difficult things for investors to identify is the exact inflection point when a struggling business turns the corner. WMT’s Q2 numbers seem to suggest that its turnaround strategy is working. But one quarter of good numbers is not a trend. WMT’s same-store sales growth of 1.6% is its strongest quarterly number since 2013. WMT’s online sales growth represents the first quarterly uptick following nine consecutive quarters of declines. Still, there are plenty of causes for concern. WMT’s U.K. operations remain a problem. Same-store sales in the U.K. plummeted 7.5% in Q2. Overall international sales were down 6.6%. Will Jet.com Be WMT’s E-Commerce Solution? Outside of WMT’s surprisingly upbeat Q2 earnings report, the biggest recent Walmart news has been a $3 billion buyout of Jet.com. Jet.com is only about a year old, but it has delivered impressive growth in that time. Jet.com’s sales have surged 168% from August 2015 to July 2016. Jet.com won’t be taking down Amazon anytime soon. However, it could be the key to Walmart establishing a solid number two position in the U.S. e-commerce market. First, Walmart added the creative vision of innovative Jet.com CEO Marc Lore. Forrester analyst Sucharita Mulpuru recently called Lore the biggest asset in Walmart’s acquisition. “What Walmart needs is an innovation machine that consistently is putting out something new every week,” Mulpuru added. Not only will Jet.com’s business model benefit from Walmart’s vendor relationships, Jet.com gives WMT something it has badly needed: an exciting e-commerce brand. Walmart has spent decades building one of the strongest brands in the world. However, that brand does not represent technology, e-commerce and innovation. No matter what the company does to make Walmart.com better, it will be very difficult for the site to compete with Amazon on reputation. Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA): The Boring Story You Shouldn’t Ignore Jet.com gives Walmart a blank state to get behind an exciting new brand that is synonymous with e-commerce. Jet.com may have gotten off to a late start in its quest to be the top Amazon alternative, but it now has the full weight of Walmart behind it. As of this writing, Wayne Duggan did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Walmart Worker Turns Herself In To Police After Accepting $1,000 In Movie Prop Cash Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart Worker Turns Herself In To Police After Accepting $1,000 In Movie Prop Cash August 24, 2016 11:21 am EST By Chris Morran@themorrancave all about the bogus benjamins scams crime news georgia walmart counterfeit bills When a movie or TV show needs stacks of cash for a scene, they don’t usually withdraw millions from the bank and hope no one walks away with it. Instead, they use prop money that will pass for the real thing on camera, but that any cashier with eyes would immediately notice is fake. So when some Walmart shoppers in Georgia managed to buy $1,000 of stuff with fake movie money, police were suspicious about the cashier’s involvement. Police in Gwinnett County, GA, first heard of the movie prop money bandits — a man and a woman — earlier this month after they used ten fake $100 bills to purchase lawn equipment at a Walmart in the town of Buford. The scammers later returned their ill-gotten purchase at a different Walmart where they (presumably) received real cash in return. The Walmart cashier who accepted the funny money in the first place came under suspicion after she failed to return to work following the incident. Police say that the cashier knew the female scammer and had confronted her about money the scammer owed her before the male fraudster handed her the fake bills — clearly marked as for “Motion Picture Use Only” on both the front and the back. The 19-year-old cashier turned herself in to authorities on Tuesday afternoon. She and the other pair face first-degree forgery charges, while the couple are expected to face additional charges of theft-by-deception.

Toggle Navigation A-   A+ Sign in News   Stock Home «Back Walmart reviewing cotton certification records of Welspun Press Trust of India | New Delhi Aug 24, 2016 02:42 PM IST Global retail giant Walmart is reviewing cotton certification records of Welspun India in the wake of Target Corporation's decision to terminate contract with the Gujarat-based textiles maker over alleged lapses in products supplied to it. Confirming that Welspun supplies a number of products to Walmart, a spokesperson of the US retail major said: "We are currently reviewing Welspun cotton certification records and plan to have additional conversations with Welspun. If we discover an issue, we will handle it appropriately." The development follows Target Corp, which had after an extensive investigation, confirmed that Welspun that uses Egyptian cotton to make bedsheets and pillowcases sold by the retailer, substituted another type of non-Egyptian cotton when producing these sheets between August 2014 and July 2016. The retailer had said as soon as its investigation confirmed the substitution, it pulled all remaining product from Target stores and Target.Com. "We have informed Welspun that, due to this conduct, we are in the process of terminating our relationship with them," Target Corp said. Welspun on its part had said it has initiated immediate actions to investigate the root cause and was appointing an external auditor to audit its supply systems and processes. Shares of Welspun India were trading at Rs 59.30 on BSE post afternoon, down 9.95 per cent from previous close. The shares had crashed 19.99 per cent yesterday to Rs 65.85 - its lower circuit limit - on BSE.

Now, global retail giant Walmart is reviewing cotton certification records of Welspun India in the wake of Target Corporation's decision to terminate contract with the Gujarat-based textiles maker over alleged lapses in products supplied to it. Confirming that Welspun supplies a number of products to Walmart, a spokesperson of the US retail major said: "We are currently reviewing Welspun cotton certification records and plan to have additional conversations with Welspun. If we discover an issue, we will handle it appropriately." The development follows Target Corp, which had after an extensive investigation, confirmed that Welspun that uses Egyptian cotton to make bedsheets and pillowcases sold by the retailer, substituted another type of non-Egyptian cotton when producing these sheets between August 2014 and July 2016. The retailer had said as soon as its investigation confirmed the substitution, it pulled all remaining product from Target stores and Target.com. "We have informed Welspun that, due to this conduct, we are in the process of terminating our relationship with them," Target Corp said. Welspun on its part had said it has initiated immediate actions to investigate the root cause and was appointing an external auditor to audit its supply systems and processes. Target is Welspun India's biggest customer after Bed Bath and Beyond. It accounted for about $90 million, or 10 percent of the company's total business in the financial year through March, Welspun executives said on a conference call on Monday. Welspun said on the call that it was investigating the product specification issue and would hire one of the Big Four accountancy firms to review its supply processes. also see Flipkart sees huge potential in grocery, furniture to keep Amazon at bay Ishaat Hussain, who did not vote for Cyrus Mistry's exit, is TCS chairman: A short profile LafargeHolcim acquires chunk of Ambuja, ACC shares worth Rs 1,832 cr According to a report in the Fortune magazine, retail giant JC Penny too is conducting a probe into the company's products. “JCPenney is conducting a thorough investigation of its Welspun textiles to ensure the integrity of its product claims. It is too early in our review process to determine what actions may be necessary,” a company has been quoted as saying in the Fortune report. In last three days, Welspun India's stock has tanked 42 percent, while its market capitalisation has eroded by a whopping Rs 4,376 crore from Rs 10,335 crore on 21 August to Rs 5958 crore on 24 August.

Oanh Ha Welspun has lost as much as 43% of its market value this week, the worst performance among India’s top 200 companies. Hanoi: Welspun India Ltd shares tumbled by the daily limit for a third day as the controversy over the manufacturer passing off cheaper bed sheets as premium Egyptian cotton widened, with customers Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and J.C. Penney Co. now reviewing items to verify product claims. Shares dropped 10% on Wednesday to Rs.59.30 in Mumbai. The company has lost as much as 43% of its market value this week, the worst performance among India’s top 200 companies. J.C. Penney, the manufacturer’s fifth-biggest customer, said the company is reviewing its Welspun products. It’s too early to determine what actions the retailer might take, spokeswoman Daphne Avila said in an email Tuesday. Target said on 19 August it had pulled sheets and pillowcases off its shelves after discovering they were mislabeled as Egyptian cotton. It also terminated all business with the supplier. Part of a roughly $3 billion conglomerate headed by Balkrishan Goenka—with interests spanning textiles, steel, pipes, energy and infrastructure—Welspun now faces one of its worst crises since being founded 30 years ago. Welspun said it’s reviewing its supply chain and would hire a “Big Four” accounting firm to examine its processes. The company is engaging with key customers, managing director Rajesh Mandawewala said during a conference call Monday. The company manufactures every fifth towel sold in the US and counts Costco Wholesale Corp. and Macy’s Inc among its customers. Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, is reviewing Welspun’s cotton certification records and plans to hold further discussions with the manufacturer. The chain is also reviewing its other suppliers of Egyptian cotton products out of an abundance of caution, spokeswoman Marilee McInnis said Tuesday. Bloomberg K.

LaSandra McKeever will be featured in an upcoming edition of the Women of Distinction Magazine in 2016/2017. Beginning her career in retail as a Department Manager for Walmart Stores, Inc. in 2002, LaSandra McKeever was eager to transfer into a new field that would offer her the ability to grow and promote from within. As Department Manager, she received numerous awards and recognitions from corporate leaders at local, regional, and divisional levels for her performance and operational excellence. In 2004, she was offered an entry level position at the corporate office in Bentonville, Arkansas. McKeever knew that climbing the corporate ladder was going to take hard work and determination. Her passion provided her the strength to move both she and her son from southern Indiana to northwest Arkansas and continue her career. During her tenure with the organization, she learned the ins and outs from Store Operations and Merchandising to Logistics and Supply Chain. Her opportunities with the retail giant continued to blossom over the last 15 years and today she is serving as a Senior Planner of Import Demand for their US stores. "Working in retail is not easy," McKeever said. "It's not uncommon for me to put in 85-hour work weeks to get the job done, but I love what I do and the people I work alongside every day. It's been a blessing to be able to work for such a wonderful company with so much opportunity at my fingertips." In McKeever's role, she is responsible for performing import analysis and forecasting corporate sales demand to maintain healthy inventory levels in warehouses and stores to drive sales through product flow and availability. She must also ensure that the product the customers' desires are always available to them at all times. Serving an average of 260 million customers weekly around the world, maintaining product flow and availability are at the forefront. McKeever has been serving as the Director of Public Relations for the Moto Guzzi National Owners Club for nearly 10 years. It's a motorcycle club that is comprised of approximately 1,800 members who are predominantly men. She also serves as a Discussion Board Moderator for Wildguzzi.com, is active with various other professional organizations, and volunteers and participates for several events throughout the year that are near and dear to her heart. McKeever and her family reside in Southwest Missouri and it's her husband to whom she credits for having taught her the patience, integrity, and discipline to find a job that doesn't feel like work.

This stock hit lower circuit for 3rd day in a row, down 42% India Today 24-08-2016 Shares of Welspun India hit lower circuit for the third day in a row on Wednesday, as the fallout from Target Corp's decision to terminate business with the firm for passing off cheap sheets as premium Egyptian cotton escalated. After Target and Walmart, now JC Penney said it will investigate Welspun textiles product claims. The stock of the company plunged 10 per cent to Rs 59.30 on the BSE. The scrip has lost 42.24 per cent in last three days. Target said on Friday that it was severing ties with Welspun after its extensive investigation had confirmed that the Indian company, which purportedly used Egyptian cottons to make sheets and pillowcases sold to the retailer, substituted non-Egyptian cotton instead. Target is Welspun India's biggest customer after Bed Bath and Beyond. It accounted for about $90 million, or 10 percent of the company's total business in the financial year through March, Welspun executives said on a conference call on Monday. Welspun said on the call that it was investigating the product specification issue and would hire a Big Four accountancy firm to review its supply processes. Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Welspun's third-biggest customer, is also reviewing the company's cotton certification records, the Wall Street Journal reported. A spokesman for Welspun said the company did not wish to comment on the reported Wal-Mart review. The US retail giant accounts for about 8 to 9 per cent of Welspun's revenues, according to Elara Capital analyst Sumant Kumar. "The risk is there as these are still early stages, so we need to wait and see," Kumar said. Sales of Egyptian cotton bedding account for only about 6 percent of Welspun's total sales, according to Kumar, but the loss to the company's credibility means other customers could withdraw all their business as Target has done. Analysts said Welspun did not provide clear answers during Monday's conference call, when asked whether other customers could follow Target's move to cut ties. "We are actively engaged with our clients," Welspun's Managing Director Rajesh Mandawewala said, in response to that query on the call. Kumar, in his note, said Welspun executives were vague on facts during the call, which threw up more questions than answers.

Looking for Growth in Smaller Settings The Food Institute Blog Amazon, Instacart Make Waves in Online Grocery Posted on August 25, 2016 by Jennette Zitelli It's no secret that online grocery shopping is a big deal. Companies ranging from Kroger to Walmart to Amazon are all trying to crack the code of what makes the perfect grocery shopping experience, as the competition grows every day. Just last week I profiled three more supermarkets that are entering the e-commerce game, and I'm sure I could do the same thing every week. That's why I'm here to bring you even more updates in the world of digital grocery sales. Reports are emerging that Amazon is developing three stores under a new grocery concept in Seattle, WA, and California's Bay Area, that would allow shoppers to pre-order online, or from a tablet in-store, before picking up the groceries at a brick and mortar location, reported Forbes. Supermarket Guru Phil Lempert notes Amazon has the potential to be a huge success in the grocery industry, for two main reasons. One is that it is a good retailer for both national brands and small startups because it is easy to work with and delivers on sales. It is also a great way to leverage distribution to other retailers and build a customer base. The second reason is that Lempert believes click-and-collect models will continue to prevail due to the logistical challenges of food delivery. He also notes that Amazon's online marketplace differs from other retailers in that it has superior intelligence to recommend products that shoppers might like, which makes the shopping process even easier for customers. Recipe websites and meal kits are also driving online grocery shopping. Not only is convenience a factor with these services, but health is also important. Nutrition startup PlateJoy partnered with Instacart to allow users to send their lists to the grocery delivery service and have meals delivered within an hour, reported Dallas Business Journal. PlateJoy builds healthy meal plans and grocery lists based on users' health goals and preferences. Instacart delivers to roughly 25 regions across the country, and PlateJoy plans to extend its partnership to all of those service areas by the end of 2016. Healthcare company MedStar Health Inc. is also launching a similar service with Instacart, called WellRooted, that is aimed at customers with Type 2 diabetes, reported Upstart Business Journal. The WellRooted site automatically connects to Instacart to populate customers' grocery lists and schedule delivery of the ingredients. All the meals are less than 600 calories and have no more than 60 grams of carbs and less than 750 milligrams of sodium. Instacart is also partnering with Cash & Carry, a wholesale food distributor and food service warehouse that specializes in large quantities of food. Cash & Carry, which is owned by California-based Smart and Final, will partner with Instacart in the Seattle area. John Mathews, vice president of sales and marketing for Cash & Carry, notes the partnership opens up the option of ordering office snacks in bulk or large quantities of food for a party, and having them delivered right to customers' doorsteps. It also gives the retailer's customers, which are mostly small independent restaurants, the option of delivery, which it has never had before, reported Puget Sound Business Journal. If all of that wasn't enough to keep Instacart busy, it is also expanding its one-hour delivery service to Fort Lauderdale, FL, its second market in the state. Fort Lauderdale residents in 11 zip codes can order from retailers like Whole Foods Market, Publix, Total Wine & More and Petco. The decision to expand was driven by the company's success in Miami, FL.

There were just TOO many awards to give out in person at the ceremony, but the APD managed to award multiple officers for their hard work in the community, for the very first time. June 14 was a tough day for all Amarillo law enforcement, as a standoff at Walmart on Georgia received attention all over the U.S. While it was difficult for bystanders, officers had an even harder job. At the ceremony many were commended for their swift thinking in the situation. For the first time, an awards ceremony was held to honor those who put their life on the line. "I think that people should be recognized and for things like that, they should be recognized in front of their peers,"  APD Interim Chief Ed Drain said. "So, that's the genesis of the idea for this." Officers were also honored for their time with the force, many having over 20 years under their belt, and medals for situations where on and off-duty officers stepped in to save a life were handed out. Chief Drain said this ceremony is a reflection of the appreciation he has for the men and women in blue. "Some officers will say that they don't think that being recognized by their peers is important, but you know most of the guys brought their families," Drain said. "I think it's good for their families that these officers are also publicly recognized." Due to the Walmart situation once again there were too many awards to give out; however, they will be presented to officers at a later date. Drain feels his department in Plano was a bit of an inspiration for this new ceremony, which may also make it easier for officers to come into work and know their work will be appreciated. "The agency that I'm currently employed by full time, the Plano police department, we do an annual...a quarterly ceremony and then we also do an annual award show for even bigger awards. I think something like that would fit good in Amarillo police department. Especially with so many officers doing such good work here." Here is a list of the incidents that led to today's awards: On Aug. 25, at 2:00 PM, Chief Drain held a department awards ceremony for civilians and sworn personnel. He presented SWAT team members Corporal Gary Hamilton and Corporal Brian Ainsworth with the Medal of Valor for their roles in the Wal-Mart incident on June 14, 2016. Hamilton and Ainsworth were inside of the store and played a key part in saving two hostages from an armed suspect. Officer J.C. Drennan was also presented with the Medal of Valor for his response to a vehicle accident on May 14, 2016. Drennan arrived on scene of the accident at IH-40 and Paramount and saw that the vehicle was upside down and fully engulfed in flames. Officer Drennan saw a person trapped in the back seat of the vehicle and at great risk to his own life, approached the fire and pulled the victim to safety. Drennan was able to get the victim out of the burning car and save his life that day. The Medal of Valor is the highest award given by the police department. An officer must show exceptional bravery and courageous action at great risk of life or bodily injury to receive this award. Officer Keifer Burton and Officer Hamilton Stanfield received Life Saving Awards. On March 14, 2016, they were dispatched to the Slim’s Pool Palace on a shooting. Burton and Stanfield found two victims suffering from gunshot wounds. They applied tourniquets to the victims, one of whom had an arterial bleed. The actions of the officers saved both of the victim’s lives. Officer David Wolven and Officer Nathan Thompson received life saving awards. On June 6, 2016 Thompson and Wolven were dispatched to the pedestrian bridge at Amarillo Blvd and Kentucky on a suicidal person. The person was threatening to jump from the bridge. The officers were able to pull the person off of the guardrail just as he was about to jump. The officers took the person to safety and there by saved his life. Officer Ray Tollerson received an Education Award for acquiring his Bachelor’s Degree in Applied Science with a major in Justice Administration. Corporal Justin Graham received an Education Award for acquiring his Master’s Degree in Arts of Management with a specialization in Organizational Management. Several employees were also recognized for their time of service with the department. Lieutenant Berry Carden, Lieutenant Ephraim Contreras, Sergeant Marvin Hill, Sergeant Rodney Clark, Sergeant Keith Cook, and civilian employee Sherry Naylor were recognized for thirty years of service to the City of Amarillo. Civilian Employee Tracy Carr was recognized for twenty years of service. Several officers have been recognized with other awards, and they will be presented to them by their divisions on a later date. Fifty nine police department employees from the rank of lieutenant down to officer received the Meritorious Service Award. This award is presented to employees for their outstanding performance of duties under unusual, complicated or hazardous conditions of any period of time. Ninety Two employees from the rank of colonel down to officer received Operation Citations. This is presented to any officer that causes favorable review by a fellow employee or a civilian and also shows exemplary judgment, initiative, or conduct. The Amarillo Police Department wants to congratulate all of the employees that received awards and thank all of its employees for their service. They also want to thank the citizens of Amarillo for allowing us to serve you.

The Office of Sustainability is bringing the first Eco Move-In Market to the International House meeting room on August 26 from 9:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Some of the goods collected in the previous semester’s Eco Move-Out will now be on sale for $2 to $20. Market organizer Maja Osmanagic said the market provides a unique opportunity for students to purchase more affordable goods when moving in. “A lot of students are international students, there are some that might not have certain items that they might need,” Osmanagic said. Osmanagic added that residents will be able to find clothing and household items that are well-suited for life in Edmonton. Items such as Sorel winter boots, pots and lamps will be sold at prices comparable to those at Goodwill, which has partnered with the Office of Sustainability for the market. Higher end items, such as designer handbags, will sell for closer to $20. Profits from the market will be split between Goodwill and the Office of Sustainability, which will invest the money back into their programming. Osmanagic emphasized that the event is still focused on providing a service to students rather than gaining profits. The market is a new addition to the Eco Move-Out program, a student service which has been running at the University of Alberta since 2012. Donations to Eco Move-Out, collected in bins set up at campus residences at the end of winter and summer semesters, have increased substantially since the program’s inception. In 2012, 2,980 kg of used clothing, household items, electronic waste and food bank donations were collected. This year 12,800 kg were collected. Osmanagic attributes the increasing success of Eco Move-Out to the convenience it affords to outgoing residents. “It’s really convenient for (the residents),” she said. “That’s a big strength of the program. We really facilitate that collection of items that otherwise would have gone to landfills.” The idea for the market has been in the making for a long time, as the Office of Sustainability has hoped to recycle goods collected from Eco Move-Out by giving them back to students, Osmanagic said. “Just thinking about what we could do with certain move out items and how we could give them a second life and bring them back to the students in a way,” she said. “And provide them with this opportunity to get educated about waste in residence and Goodwill and our programming.” This is the first move-in market on campus, but the event might move to a different location in the future to cater more to the broader Edmonton community as well, Osmanagic said. “We’re just really excited to have (the market) go on this year,” Osmanagic said. “To see the potential and if this is something that speaks to the campus community and if this is something that they’re engaged in.” Latest Posts More scholar for the dollar: the predicament of contract academic staff 1050: ECHA Residence Roundup: November 23 Music to help you #keepitwavy after fall reading week Annea Lockwood helps nature sound off in FAB Gallery exhibit Three Lines Free Please leave this field empty.

Orlando entrepreneurs bring hot drink from Trinidad to American grocery shelves Orlando's De Licia and Moonish Badaloo are trying to get cocoa tea on the lips of Central Florida chocolate lovers. The couple is importing the cocoa tea from their native nation of Trinidad under their company Kashmiir. "It's very popular with our family in Trinidad and it doesn't have any preservatives or anything,' De Licia Badaloo said. Kashmiir sells at Caribbean Supercenter in Orlando. But she is hoping to stock it soon at specialty grocers such as Whole Foods. The cocoa tea has a coffee-like quality with more of a chocolate flavor. Kashmiir cocoa tea comes in small blocks. The cocoa is mixed with cinnamon, nutmeg and bay leaf.

The cocoa tea is made and packaged in Trinidad. The Badaloos have an unique packaging for Kashmiir, which they distribute through a warehouse in Central Florida. Grocery pick-up Wal-Mart is expanding its grocery pick-up program to four more local stories. Wal-Mart already offers the service at four stores in Central Florida, where customers order items online and then have the purchase brought to their vehicle. Wal-Mart Neighborhood stores in Lake Mary and Orlando at 9047 Curry Ford Road are adding the service, in addition to the Supercenter stores in Clermont and eastern Orlando. Groceries and other items are the same price in store as through the pick-up program. 1000 Degrees Pizza Another fast-fired pizza chain is heading to Central Florida, this time with an Italian twist. 1000 Degrees Neapolitan Pizza has partnered with local franchisees Matt and Caroline Peach to expand in Central Florida. "It's more of an original Naples-style crust than the other places," said Peach, who also runs three Maaco auto-painting businesses in Central Florida. Peach said the hand-tossed, Italian-style crust at 1000 Degrees sets it apart. It might be a few months before the first location can open, Peach said. The first site will likely be established in the Windermere area. "It's pretty hard to get a building right now," Peach said. "They are getting leased as fast as they are built." Darden shareholder vote Darden Restaurants shareholders vote on whether the company should phase out the use of meats grown with unnecessary antibiotics. An environmental mutual fund called the Green Century Equity Fund has placed the issue on the ballot. The vote will take place at Darden's annual shareholder meeting Sept. 29.

Bucyrus trio face drug charges in Pike County Sara Nealeigh , Reporter 7:01 p.m. EDT August 25, 2016 File photo (Photo: Journal & Courier) 307 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE WAVERLY - Charges against two women and a man from Crawford County who were arrested in a Pike County parking lot Tuesday have been made public. Tommy D. Rule, 73; Kyah L. Myers-Zehner, 22; and Kayce E. Hahn, 22, all of Bucyrus, are facing felony charges after Waverly Police and the Pike County Sheriff's Office searched a vehicle the three were in at the Walmart in Waverly. Rule was charged with trafficking in drugs and permitting drug abuse, both fifth-degree felonies. Zehner was charged with tampering with evidence, a third-degree felony, and Hahn was charged with possession of drugs, a fifth-degree felony, according to Waverly Police officials. Waverly Police Department officials said the three were taken into custody in the Walmart parking lot shortly after 4 p.m. Tuesday. A K-9 unit was brought in moments later to assist at the scene and perform a sniff search of the vehicle. Officials said the K-9 indicated on the passenger-side door and a full search of the vehicle was performed. There, officers found what they suspect to be heroin. Waverly Police said they were told by those in the vehicle the substance was heroin. The suspected heroin has been submitted to the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation, and officials said further charges could be pending the results of those tests. Officials said they are awaiting lab results to say how much heroin was found in the car. More than eight marked cruisers were on the scene at the time of the incident, the majority from the Pike County Sheriff's Office, along with other unmarked cars, police officials said. No other details were immediately available because of the ongoing investigation. 307 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/2c01dpJ TOP VIDEOS MADE Rally 2:18 Trump supporters speak up 1:57 Unioto's Jeff Metzler talks possible playoff berth 0:54 Cavaliers clinch playoff berth 0:43 Town hall addresses variety of heroin-related topics 1:49 Highlights from Adena's 34-14 win over Paint Valley 1:30 Highlights from Unioto's 34-33 win over Piketon 1:53 Unioto's Ryan Smith sends Tanks home a winner 0:06 Who killed Harry Smith? 1:05 Brown's Lawn and Garden Equipment security footage 0:41 ZT's Harris speaks after 31-0 win over Paint Valley 0:43 Piketon sweeps Peebles, focuses on Adena 1:00 Cavs sweep Blue Lions in SCOL action 1:14 Drug Sweep 8:25 Drug Sweep.mov 8:25 Sights and sounds of Honoring Our Heroes 1:08 Davis talks about historic night 0:49 1194th Returns 3:34 Sights & Sounds of Junior Fair Night 1:23 Healthy Children Event 1:19 Anti-discrimination rally 1:33 Luke Feeney speaks at DNC 1:28 Newark Post 85 edges Chillicothe Post 757 in pitchers' duel 1:08 Art of the Strikeout 1:27 Behind the scenes of Chillicothe fireworks 1:05 Armory Tour 2:20 Behind the scenes at "Tecumseh!" 1:25 Uncovering Camp Sherman 2:45 Memorial Day 2016 1:52 Washington Ave. house fire 0:31 Protest of prison farm sale 0:59 St. Mary Church restoration 1:47 Reactions to Community Intervention event 3:35 A Community Intervention 2:04 Visiting interventionist speaks to drug court participants 2:20 Mourners come together for six Pike County murder victims 0:53 Officials confront overdoses 1:36 Stranger donates kidney 0:16 Ohio pastor talks Christianity, 2016 presidential election 0:44 Police swear in new officers 0:58 Courthouse clock restored 1:35 Unioto tops Chillicothe for sectional title 1:01 Steps to using Narcan 1:07 Sheriff's office training simulator 1:12 Laurel Street shooting 0:58 Billy Ireland Cartoon Library and Museum 0:26 Deputy gets last chance agreement 3:23 Shop With a Cop 0:44 Unioto SCOPES program 1:51 Veterans section preview 2:08 Rutherford re-elected 0:15 Feeney thanks supporters 1:26 Corzine, Shoemaker elected to city school board 0:37 Sunday morning police chase 1:07 Artful Decisions 0:33 Carlisle building reopening 0:43 1194th Engineer Company call to duty 1013 0:33 Carlisle renovation sneak peek 1:19 Ross' Presidential Hopeful 2:21 Alex Adkins on making music 1:25 Bull Creek Homicide 1:02 Music & Memory 1:05 Junior Fair Night - Outhouse races 1:05 Fatal shooting 911 call 2:50 Waterfall at Tecumseh! 1:33 Plyleys Lane flooding 0:17 New search & rescue drone 1:51 Taking back the community 0:30 911 call: Body found in Highland County 1:57 No Dope, Just Hope 1:21 Operation Guardian Shield 1:34 Teacher spots 6-foot shark 0:47 Reporter attempts Tueller Drill 0:56 Tiffany Sayre's family present during investigation 2:02 Body found by Trego Creek Road 3:23 Cohen stars in surgery 1:00 Fatal Ohio Turnpike crash 1:15 Trees down on Watt Street 0:29 Trees down on Watt St. 0:29 Chillicothe storm 1:59 PRCTC student talks drones 1:33 Procedure for a STAT drug screening 3:43 Firefighters help teen 0:40 2015 Scioto Valley March of Dimes Ambassador Family 5:31 Ofc.

Amazon, Google, Walmart, Domino’s Pizza in New Zealand … wait, Domino’s Pizza in New Zealand? Well, it certainly seems that way, and let’s face it, if anything needs to be delivered in super-quick time, it’s pizza. So Domino’s – in New Zealand – is on the case. Working with Nevada-based drone delivery specialist Flirtey, Domino’s ran a test flight on the outskirts of Auckland on Thursday, successfully demonstrating a delivery system where the flying machine lowers the pizza – inside a box, obviously – to the ground via a winch. In a bid to show just how serious it is about its plan to offer pizza deliveries by drone, Domino’s invited to the demonstration a representative from the country’s civil aviation authority as well as transport minister Simon Bridges. And they both turned up. The delivery marked the final step in Flirtey’s approval process for Domino’s delivery plan, with flights to customer homes expected to launch later this year from a select New Zealand store … except that it does still have to be green-lighted by the authorities. Related: Flirtey completes first-ever legal, delivery-by-drone mission in the U.S. “With the increased number of deliveries we make each year, we were faced with the challenge of ensuring our delivery times continue to decrease and that we strive to offer our customers new and progressive ways of ordering from us,” said Don Meij of Domino’s Pizza Australia. Hang on, that name rings a bell. Ah yes, he’s the fella behind DRU, the diminutive delivery droid that the company also wants to use to deliver its food. Despite the delivery drone still needing regulatory approval, Meij insists the the ambitious plan “isn’t a pie-in-the-sky idea.” Yes, he really said that. The pizza boss added that the strategy is as authentic as the cheese that tops the company’s pizzas, and that he’s determined to “make this a reality for our customers.” Also watch: Hover Flying Camera is Like Having Your Own Paparazzi Please enable Javascript to watch this video

Matika on Tuesday. Amber Colleen Defiore, 23, of Lehighton, pleaded to one count of retail theft. She was arrested on Feb. 5 by Mahoning Township police for an incident at the Walmart store. Matika sentenced her to time served (65 days) to one year in jail and ordered her to make restitution of $73.92, get a drug and alcohol evaluation, zero tolerance for drug and alcohol use, render 50 hours of community service and stay out of Walmart. Earlier this month she was sentenced to serve 30 days to one day less 24 months in a fleeing police charge which she is still serving. Corey R.

The big state of Texas actually dominates NerdWallet's top 10 list, with communities near Austin and Houston also getting high marks. NerdWallet examined the most-recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau, GreatSchools and NeighborhoodScout for 245 places in the U.S. with populations from 25,000 to 100,000. The analysis considers home values and affordability, median annual income, growth and factors that families consider, including school quality and crime.

If you are a homebuyer looking to narrow your choice of locations in a big or small city, try NerdWallet's home affordability calculator to learn how much you can pay toward a mortgage each month while also staying on top of debts, spending and savings. Most of the small cities on the top 10 list are suburbs, with many less than 30 miles from the nearest big city. Families in these places will find the convenience of higher-paying jobs and other big-city amenities without long commutes. Best small cities for families 1. Wylie This city, about 30 miles northeast of Dallas, is between Lavon Lake and Lake Ray Hubbard, which means it offers access to outdoor activities for families. The city of 44,000 residents has the second-most affordable homes in the top 10, with a median home value of $154,600 in 2014. Of all 245 cities analyzed, Wylie has the seventh-highest median annual income growth, which jumped over 19% from 2009 to 2014. Schools in Wylie earned a rating of 9 out of 10 by reviewers at GreatSchools.org. 2. Spring Hill, Tennessee Spring Hill, which is about 30 miles south of Nashville, has experienced growth as a manufacturing hub, particularly for cars. It boasts the ninth-highest population growth of the 245 cities, with a 37% jump in residents from 2009 to 2014. In Spring Hill, nearly 50% of families, the third-highest in the top 10, have children under age 18. That's not the only reason this Tennessee town is family-friendly: Schools in Spring Hill are rated a strong 9 out of 10 by reviewers at GreatSchools. 3. Leander, Texas Leander is a growing Austin suburb and the only one connected to the capital's downtown via light rail. Leander has the most affordable houses of the top 10 cities, with the median home value in 2014 at just $154,500 -- which is about half of the value of homes in Austin, according to Zillow. Of the 245 cities analyzed, Leander was No. 10 when it comes to the percentage of families (nearly 52%) with children younger than 18. This city's population grew over 34% from 2009 to 2014, as the Austin area booms. 4. Bentonville, Arkansas Home to the headquarters of Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, Bentonville is one of two cities in the top 10 that's not a suburb. Residents here experienced the highest income growth of all 245 cities analyzed, with median annual household incomes rising over 39% from 2009 to 2014. Schools in Bentonville scored a 9 out of 10 at GreatSchools.org, and homes here are the fourth-most affordable in the top 10 cities. The downtown boasts a free and extensive art museum funded by the family of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton, and there's a Wal-Mart visitor center near the site of the original store. 5. Carmel, Indiana The formerly sleepy suburb north of Indianapolis has become a growing, affluent Midwest city. Residents here earn the second-highest median annual household income ($107,916 in 2014) of the top cities. Incomes in Carmel have grown over 11% from 2009 to 2014, while the population jumped 25%. The city is home to many major employers, such as Geico, and over 40 corporate headquarters, according to the city. Carmel's schools earned a GreatSchools rating of 9 out of 10. 6. Pearland, Texas Once a small agricultural town known for pears and other crops, this south Houston suburb has the biggest population of all 245 cities analyzed, with over 97,000 residents as of 2014. Residents of Pearland have the fourth-highest median annual household income in the top 10 cities at $94,653 in 2014. Families will find highly rated schools and many families -- 45% of families here have young children. Pearland is also home to the famous Killen's Barbecue, a favorite of Houston Texans player J.J. Watt. 7. League City, Texas Located along Clear Lake and next to the Gulf Coast, League City is part of the Houston metro area, giving residents easy access to the nation's fourth-biggest city by population. The city attracts families who love fishing and boating with four marinas, and the schools are a lure, too: League City's schools were rated 8 out of 10 at GreatSchools. Residents here have the fifth-highest median annual household income among the top 10 at nearly $91,000 in 2014, and the median home value was $182,000 that year. 8. Allen Allen, 27 miles north of Dallas, was home to nearly 90,000 residents in 2014, making it the second-largest city in the top 10. This affluent Texas city also has the third-highest median annual household income ($102,120 in 2014) of the top 10 cities. Allen's schools received strong rankings, with a rating of 9 out of 10 at GreatSchools. Allen boasts nearly 50 miles of hiking and nature trails, along with almost 800 acres of developed parks -- and over 200 restaurants. 9. Little Elm There's no doubt Little Elm is family-friendly: Nearly 54% of families in this city of about 30,000 residents have children under age 18, the highest percentage in the top 10 cities. It's also growing quickly, with a 32% jump in population from 2009 to 2014. Located in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, Little Elm -- and its over 66 miles of shoreline on Lewisville Lake -- is ideal for those who love being near the water. Homes in Little Elm are also the third-most affordable among the top cities, with a median home value of $159,200 in 2014. 10. Wildwood, Missouri Although Wildwood, on the outskirts of St. Louis, has the highest median home value ($351,400 in 2014) in the top cities, residents also earn the highest median annual household income ($123,578). Residents in this affluent city, which was incorporated in 1995, enjoy 32 miles of trails, in addition to city, state and county parks. It's also just a few miles from the Hidden Valley Ski Area.

James MacIntosh in a press release. He said the first incident involved $765 worth of camping equipment that Jason Diaz, 37, of Ringwood allegedly took from the store without paying at 12:25 p.m. on Aug. 20. Store security stopped Diaz as he attempted to leave, and he was charged by Patrolman Travis Roemmele with third-degree shoplifting. Diaz was released with a September date at Morris County Central Judicial Processing. The second incident was a disorderly persons offense because the alleged shoplifting came to a smaller dollar amount - $34.35 worth of merchandise. Responding to the store at 4:11 p.m. on Aug. 23, Detective Sgt. Chris Biro charged Daniel Duffy, 18, of Pompton Plains with this shoplifting and he was released with a September date in Riverdale Municipal Court. DWI allegation On the morning of Aug. 22, Patrolman Mike Reilly saw a brown Jeep swerving on Route 23 North before exiting onto Interstate 287 North, which led to a DWI charge for a Butler man, police said. As the officer followed the vehicle, he saw the Jeep exit onto the ramp for Hamburg Turnpike and turn left onto Hamburg despite being in the right-turn lane, reports Lt. James MacIntosh in a press release. When pulled over by police, Pedro Aguilar allegedly provided a driver's license from Maryland despite saying that he has lived in New Jersey for over two months. MacIntosh said the driver had a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage on his breath and demonstrated slow hand movements as he fumbled with his paperwork. Following field sobriety tests and a breath-alcohol exam, Aguilar was charged with driving while intoxicated, expired touring privileges, and failure to maintain lane. He was released to a friend with a September court date in Riverdale.

Like other big companies before it, including Wal-Mart and Google, Apple recently received a federal designation for its energy subsidiary that allows it to become a wholesale seller of electricity from coast to coast. In effect, Apple is creating its own green utility company, although the main customer is itself. The motives may be economic as much as they are environmental. As a wholesaler, Apple could reduce the cost of its electricity load, which reached 831 million kilowatt-hours in the last fiscal year – enough to power about 76,000 homes for a year. But like a growing number of corporations, Apple is intent on reducing carbon dioxide emissions from electricity production — one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. In one ambitious venture, Apple has contracted with First Solar to begin buying a little less than half of the power later this year from California Flats, a solar energy farm now under construction. Under the terms of the deal, Apple will pay $848 million for the electricity over 25 years and receive the farm’s total output by the end of the agreement. It is one of largest commercial clean energy contracts yet. Lisa Jackson, former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, who is now the Apple executive overseeing environmental policy, social initiatives and worldwide government affairs, said she hoped Apple could serve as a model for the many other big corporate power users that are now embracing clean energy. “This is just another sort of innovative way to get that power onto the grid so we don’t have to take the California grid-mix default, which still includes fossil fuel,” Jackson said. Google, which received its federal energy wholesale designation from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 2010, is a big proponent of the approach Apple is now taking. “Running any kind of business, having predictability in terms of your operating costs can be very important,” said Gary Demasi, director of operations for data centre energy and location strategy at Google, which has been a leading investor in and user of clean energy. “Renewable energy, from a cost perspective, is now competitive with other forms of energy, much more so than it was a few years ago.” In the United States, the generating capacity of corporate clean energy projects has more than doubled each year since 2013, according to the Business Renewables Centre at the Rocky Mountain Institute, which tracks publicly announced deals. In 2015, 11 companies signed up for 3.23 gigawatts’ worth of projects, roughly the equivalent of five coal plants and up from 1.18 gigawatts the year before. Executives face greater pressure from shareholders and customers to show that they are doing their part to fight climate change. At the same time, corporate energy use has exploded, driven in many cases by the ravenous demands of the data cloud. “We are all becoming very large energy players, and this is a shift,” said Brian Janous, director of energy strategy at Microsoft. “Energy is not something that Microsoft or Amazon or Google really ever had to think much about prior to the advent of the cloud.” Helping drive that shift are environmental groups like the World Resources Institute. In May, it helped create the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance, a coalition of nonprofits that has more than 60 corporations in its network, including McDonald’s and General Motors, as well as Google and Wal-Mart. Although the companies say these arrangements mean they are running their businesses on renewable energy, in reality the clean power often does not flow directly to their facilities. They typically buy the renewable energy in amounts to match what they draw from the grid — a system of swaps that Jackson of Apple likened to using an ATM. “The dollar you deposit in the bank might not be the exact same bill that you get out,” she said. Robert Shapiro, a partner at the law firm Chadbourne & Parke who focuses on project finance and energy, describes it as meaningful symbolism. “They’re actually getting power from their local utility, which may be coal,” Shapiro said. “But they’re deemed to have put into the world carbon-neutral energy, which they are deemed to have used for their load.” To keep track of clean energy credits, power generators work with registries to issue numbered certificates. “The power flows into the grid. The electrons go where they go,” Tawney said. “But because there’s a renewable-energy certificate, no one else can claim the same zero-carbon benefit.” Such complexities are necessary, executives and clean energy advocates say, because it is not often feasible to install enough renewable-power generators at corporate sites to meet companies’ full energy needs. Energy buyers’ alliance Wal-Mart, despite having installed solar panels, wind turbines and fuel cells at stores and distribution centres, can nonetheless meet only about a third of those operations’ energy needs. So it also buys renewable energy from generators and utilities, said David Ozment, director of energy at Wal-Mart stores. Procter & Gamble, another member of the energy buyers’ alliance, has arranged to purchase all of the steam from a biomass generator under construction at a plant in Georgia where it makes Charmin toilet paper and Bounty paper towels, said Jack McAneny, the company’s director of sustainability. But that was possible, he said, only because of the plant’s location near a source of waste wood and pulp for fuel and the cooperation of P&G’s partners. Among those partners are the local utility, Georgia Power, which will buy the electricity from the generator for its customers from Constellation, the company that developed and will own and operate the generator. At Apple, where the purchase or production of renewable energy has more than tripled since 2012, the company would prefer to not have to go to great lengths to ensure a clean energy supply, Jackson said. But the public energy grid is simply still too dependent on carbon-based fuels to make that possible. “If we had our preference, we’d just be able to say, ‘We want 100% green power everywhere we use power,’” Jackson said. “The best would be if we could run every one of our stores, every one of our data centres, office complex, building we have, on 100% renewable – and if we didn’t have to spend a whole bunch of our time and energy figuring out how to get that done.” Go to Top Tweet Videos New Rs. 2,000 notes recovered from gunned...

REUTERS/Jim Young By Sruthi Ramakrishnan Discount retailer Dollar General Corp (DG.N) said it was cutting prices on its most popular items such as bread, eggs and milk, intensifying a price war with retail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) to win back market share. Dollar General's shares fell as much as 14 percent on Thursday after the company reported quarterly sales below estimates, blaming aggressive competition, lower food prices and a reduction of food stamp coverage in several U.S. states. Larger rival Dollar Tree Inc (DLTR.O) also reported lower-than-expected sales, sending its shares down 8.3 percent. Dollar General cut prices by 10 percent on average on about 450 of its best-selling items across 2,200 stores during the quarter, Chief Executive Todd Vasos said on a conference call. He said the company expects to extend the price reductions to more product categories and markets. Wal-Mart's strategy of cutting prices has helped the world's largest retailer to boost sales in the latest two quarters. "Wal-Mart's been doing better lately, lowering prices, and that's been a concern that (it) could impact dollar stores," Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said. "Historically, it hasn't as much but maybe we are seeing something different here." Dollar store operators have expanded aggressively in recent years, taking market share from Wal-Mart and other retailers, thanks to their smaller store sizes, improving product assortment and price points starting $1. Dollar Tree's Chief Financial officer Kevin Wampler downplayed any impact from competition. "I can't tell you (competition) is an issue anymore for us than it usually is." Retailers are also grappling with a drop in grocery prices that has pressured margins in the second quarter . Dollar General said prices for milk were down about 8 percent and for eggs over 50 percent. 'SNAP' CUTS HURT Some states changed in April the criteria for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as food stamp program, as they brought back a three-month limit on benefits for unemployed adults. More than 500,000 people are estimated to lose SNAP benefits this year, according to research group Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Dollar General said the changes in SNAP along with grocery deflation reduced same-store sales by 60-70 basis points in the second quarter ended July 29 and were expected to hurt results in the second half of the year as well. Though Dollar Tree said the impact from changes to food stamps was small, the company's acquisition of larger rival Family Dollar last year has increased its exposure to the program. Dollar Tree, which traditionally caters to middle-income consumers, attributed the "challenging retail environment" to consumers being pressured by higher rent and healthcare costs. Dollar Tree also cut its full-year sales forecast to $20.69 billion-$20.87 billion. The company's net sales rose 66 percent to $5 billion in the second quarter ended July 30, helped by the Family Dollar deal. Dollar General's net sales rose 5.8 percent to $5.39 billion.

Melissa A. Sinquefield, 30, of Buford was arrested shortly before 10 a.m. Thursday on charges of first degree forgery and theft by deception, Gwinnett Police Cpl. Michele Pihera said in an email update. Sinquefield and Travis B Taylor, 36, of Blakely, Ga. are accused of spending approximately $1,000 in fake bills for lawn equipment at the Wal-mart store on Sardis Church Road. The cashier who accepted the bills, Jocelyn Gerstenlauer, 19, of Auburn, has also turned herself in to police, and has since bonded out of jail. Taylor remains at large, and authorities believe he may have fled the metro-Atlanta area. He's wanted for a similar crime in Early County, said Pihera.

How To Get A Refund After Target Phony Fabric Controversy By Cortney Drakeford On 08/25/16 AT 11:54 AM Close Most people are willing to shell out a couple of extra bucks for quality sheets but it looks like they may have been wasting their money if they purchased their bedding from certain stores. Several U.S. retailers such as Target and Wal-Mart are in the center of controversy when it comes to bedding. The stores recently became aware that during their partnership with one of India’s biggest textile companies, the manufacturers were distributing fake “Egyptian cotton” sheets, according to The Wall Street Journal. For a long time, Egyptian cotton has been praised for its exceptional quality and softness with retailers charging premium prices for items possessing the material. However, last Friday Target announced it was pulling certain bedding items from stores after finding that Welspun India Ltd. was using phony fabric in place of Egyptian cotton, according to NBC Chicago. More than 750,000 sheets and pillowcases were manufactured by the company and labeled 500-thread count Egyptian cotton only later to be discovered that they were knock offs instead. Target revealed that from August 2014 up until July 2016, Welspun substituted items with non-Egyptian cotton when manufacturing products. The retailer then sold the falsely labeled products for as much as $175 to customers. Related Stories Walmart Buying Jet.com For $3B Amazon Tops Wall Street Targets, Lifted By Cloud Revenue Since Target’s discovery, retailers like Wal-Mart, Bed Bath & Beyond and JC Penney that are also customers of the textile company plan on opening investigations to determine whether they were supplied with authentic Egyptian cotton items. Since Target’s allegations, the share price of Welspun has been cut in half and on Wednesday the company issued a statement. The Indian manufacturer revealed, “We are taking this situation very seriously….We won’t rest until this situation is resolved.” Target has terminated its partnership with Welspun. Customers who have purchased falsely labeled products can request a refund by filling out a form on the company’s website. If approved, they will receive a gift card for the amount.

Stating that it is aware of the allegations that some of the Welspun's bedding products, labeled as Egyptian cotton, are not actually manufactured with Egyptian cotton, Bed Bath & Beyond said it "Welspun has reaffirmed to us that the Welspun product carried in our stores is Egyptian cotton". "To further assure ourselves and our customers, we have engaged an independent third party to perform an audit of the supply chain to confirm this information," a company spokesperson said in an e-mailed statement. "We will aggressively pursue our investigation and take appropriate action, if needed, until this matter is resolved to the satisfaction of Bed Bath & Beyond and its customers," the spokesperson added. Earlier in the day, Welspun India Managing Director Rajesh Mandawewala told analysts in a conference call that the firm is in the process of appointing an external independent 'Big Four Auditor', to audit all of its supply systems and processes to understand the root cause. "The audit will give us clarity on a number of questions, including where and how the issue occurred and what steps we will need to take to tighten our processes," he said, adding the audit was likely to be completed in six to eight weeks. Already global retail majors Walmart and JCPenney are investigating textiles sourced from Welspun India for product integrity, while IKEA is awaiting the outcome of a probe by the Indian firm in the wake of lapses in supplies. Welspun, which was supplying bedsheets and pillowcases made of Egyptian cotton to Target, was alleged by the US-based retailer for substituting another type of non-Egyptian cotton when producing sheets supplied between August 2014 and July 2016. Target has since decided to terminate its contract with Welspun after an investigation. Welspun on its part has said it has initiated immediate actions to investigate the root cause and was appointing an external auditor to audit its supply systems and processes. Target had said that as soon as its investigation confirmed the substitution, it pulled all remaining product from Target stores and Target.Com.

The listed retailer, majority owned by US-based Walmart, said its sales had gained despite the ongoing difficult trading environment, although these were boosted by new stores opening. Comparable stores' sales growth was 6.4 percent, with product inflation of 5.8 percent. Overall inflation is 6 percent, its lowest level this year so far. Massmart is home to brands such as Game, DionWired and Builders’ Warehouse. In a statement on Thursday, the company said sales performances across its major product categories reflect the economic pressures within the South African consumer environment. Food and liquor sales gained 13.2 percent, while general merchandise only grew 3.4 percent. Read also: Massmart benefits from insurance claim CEO Guy Hayward notes consumers are putting of purchases where they can, trading down and trimming spending on durable goods. He adds consumers are skewing spending towards emi- and non-durable items, away from durable items such as fridges and furniture. In the 26 weeks to June, the company reported sales up 8.7 percent to R42.3 billion, while operating profit before interest gained 19.5 percent to R819.1 million. Headline earnings after foreign exchange movements gained 19 percent to R320.6 million. Despite its gains, the company trimmed its dividend 49.2 percent to 74.1c. Hayward says Massmart’s deal-orientated approach say it growing market share across all major categories. “The work we have been doing here is beginning to make in-roads. An independent price survey conducted by Retail Price Watch identified Cambridge Food as being the cheapest retailer in the staples’ and beverages’ categories, while Makro was found to be the cheapest in the cereals and porridge category,” Hayward says. “This has meant general merchandise sales have softened while food sales have been stronger.” During the period, Massmart opened 9 stores, including one outside South Africa, which represents new space growth of 2.4 percent. “Our portfolio of 405 stores includes 38 outside South Africa and these represent 9.3 percent of the group's sales.” For the 34 weeks to August 21, total sales increased by 8.3 percent and comparable sales increased by 5.9 percent, it says. “ For the remainder of 2016, the South African economic environment will likely continue to constrain consumer spending across key group categories including general merchandise and home improvement/DIY, while our substantial food and liquor categories will likely continue to outperform.” Despite the current uncertainty, if the currency strengthens and food pricing move into disinflation, it is possible that trading in 2017 may be relatively better than 2016. “Trading conditions in most non-SA countries where we have stores are unlikely to deteriorate further provided there are no exogenous shocks.

Her experiences there are the foundation for a new book about the way the American military does what it does today — which is a whole lot. It's called, “How Everything Became War and the Military Became Everything: Tales from the Pentagon.” "I think Americans know roughly as much about the military as they know about the surface of the moon” says Rosa Brooks. Brooks writes about the “Walmart-ization” of the American Military. "The military has become the nation's one-stop shop. There's absolutely nothing the American military doesn't do now. It sponsors micro-enterprise programs for Afghan women. Does anti-piracy patrols. Monitors emails of suspected terrorists. Trains Iraqi judges. You name it, the military's doing it. Much like Walmart, the more you do, on the one hand, you can exploit these incredible economies of scale but the more you do, the more likely you are to do everything not all that well and it has some impacts on other agencies too." That the Pentagon has taken on so many different responsibilities beyond fighting wars is not necessarily a bad thing. But Brooks says we need to be realistic about what that means for the military.   “What’s been happening unfortunately is that we haven't really shifted military recruitment, training, personnel policies, as much as we ought to, if we think this is what we want the military to be doing in the future." There's no single fix for this, says Brooks. But it'll be hard to make any changes given "practically every member of Congress has either a military base or somebody manufacturing military aircraft or something like that in their constituency. Absolutely nobody has a factory manufacturing foreign service officers in their constituency. So all the incentives run in the direction of congress throwing money at the military whether the military wants it or not."

Micah Johnson had sought treatment for anxiety, depression and hallucinations, telling doctors that he experienced nightmares after witnessing fellow soldiers getting blown in half. He also said he heard voices and mortars exploding, according to the documents obtained by The Associated Press under the Freedom of Information Act. "I try to block those out, but it is kinda hard to forget," Johnson told his care provider, according to the documents. Johnson, 25, was the sniper who targeted the officers at the conclusion of a peaceful march July 7 in downtown Dallas, where demonstrators were protesting fatal police shootings in Minnesota and Louisiana. Armed with an assault rifle, he took multiple positions as he fired. Hours later, authorities used a bomb-carrying robot to kill him. During his deployment, Johnson was largely confined to base in an area of Afghanistan that had seen heavy combat but that was relatively quiet when his unit arrived in November 2013, according to his former squad leader. Upon his return to the U.S. nine months later, Johnson told doctors he was experiencing panic attacks a few times a week, including once while at Wal-Mart, where there was an unspecified conflict that required a police response, the records said. "Veteran states hearing all the noises, fights and police intervening caused him to have palpitations, 'My heart felt like someone was pinching it while it was beating fast,'" the records state. Johnson said he began shaking, felt short of breath and got chills following the Wal-Mart incident. The records do not show that Johnson was formally diagnosed with PTSD. The type of screening that he underwent is typically a first step to determine if the patient should be referred for further assessment to a mental health professional, said Joel Dvoskin, a clinical and forensic psychologist in Tucson, Arizona. Doctors eventually decided that Johnson presented a low risk for suicide or for hurting anyone else. Johnson was "not acutely at risk for harm to self or others," according to a medical record from a visit on Aug. 15, 2014. The patient was "not felt to be psychotic by presentation or by observation." The reservist who specialized in carpentry and masonry told health care providers he had lower back pain and was avoiding "crowds of people and when in the public, scanning the area for danger, noting all the exits, watching everyone's actions." "I feel like I can't trust all of these strangers around me," Johnson told his doctor, who noted that he had taken to drinking since his return to Dallas, consuming three to four shots of vodka up to three times a week. "It's hard for me to be around other people and I am so angry and irritable." Records from the Aug. 15 visit state that Johnson described his childhood as "stressful." His responses to a section of the form titled "Sexual/Physical/Emotional Abuse History" were redacted. Johnson was also advised to talk with a health care worker about erectile dysfunction. Johnson was prescribed a muscle relaxant, an antidepressant and anti-anxiety and sleep medication, and a nurse offered him tips on managing anger, records show. He also saw a psychiatrist and was further evaluated for his PTSD symptoms in September of that year, but the physician noted that his mood was "better." When providers called Johnson in October 2014, he requested to put off further assessment for PTSD, saying he was busy remodeling his mother's house, according to the records. He had previously told providers he planned to find a job in construction and that his long-term goal was to become a self-defense instructor. Johnson's mother, Delphene Johnson, has said her son sought medical care from the VA for a back injury but got no help after filling out forms and going to meetings. He "just finally gave up," she told TheBlaze, a news site founded by conservative talk show host Glenn Beck. Dallas VA spokesman Ozzie Garza did not immediately respond to questions regarding Johnson's treatment within the VA North Texas Health Care System, the second largest VA health care system in the country. In May 2014, new patients seeking mental health care at the Dallas VA faced a 50-day average wait, then the 10th longest in the nation. The mother of Gavin Long, the former Marine and Iraq war veteran who killed three law enforcement officers July 17 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, told PBS' Tavis Smiley that her son had post-traumatic stress disorder and unsuccessfully sought the VA's help.

(Facebook | AP) By  The Associated Press The Associated Press Follow on Twitter on August 25, 2016 at 6:59 AM, updated August 25, 2016 at 7:18 AM Print Email The Army reservist who killed five Dallas police officers last month showed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder after returning home from Afghanistan in 2014, but doctors concluded that he presented no serious risk to himself or others, according to newly released documents from the Veterans Health Administration. Micah Johnson had sought treatment for anxiety, depression and hallucinations, telling doctors that he experienced nightmares after witnessing fellow soldiers getting blown in half. He also said he heard voices and mortars exploding, according to the documents obtained by The Associated Press under the Freedom of Information Act. "I try to block those out, but it is kinda hard to forget," Johnson told his care provider, according to the documents. Johnson, 25, was the sniper who targeted the officers at the conclusion of a peaceful march July 7 in downtown Dallas, where demonstrators were protesting fatal police shootings in Minnesota and Louisiana. Armed with an assault rifle, he took multiple positions as he fired. Hours later, authorities used a bomb-carrying robot to kill him.

In 2013, a coalition that included African-Americans, liberal whites and union members helped elect him mayor, inspired by his platform of economic equality and racial justice. While a majority of black voters still support him, low overall approval ratings suggest it will be tough to hold that coalition together. At least six separate investigations by federal, state and local agencies have marred de Blasio’s administration this year. For instance, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara is investigating whether campaign contributions were given in exchange for favors. Also, many have criticized the mayor’s “affordable housing” plan, cautioning that it won’t create much housing that is affordable to low-income New Yorkers, and that it would lead to more gentrification in some neighborhoods. De Blasio is not the first big-city mayor to face problems of this kind, but he needs to think of ways he could restore confidence. Obviously, he must cooperate fully with all investigations and admit wrongdoing wherever appropriate, resolving to do better. He also needs to remember the voters who elected him and think about what kinds of policies could help restore their confidence. Last week, de Blasio announced a plan that definitely represents a step in the right direction. He unveiled reforms to create a zoned system for commercial-waste pickup that seeks to reduce truck traffic and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 42 to 64 percent, according to a study by two city agencies, the Department of Sanitation and the Business Integrity Commission. Advocates for the changes, including the Teamsters union, say the reforms also would improve labor conditions for the truckers and provide more incentive for recycling. The changes signal a commitment to a greener economy. The sanitation reforms are not sexy, and unlike universal pre-K (an early policy win for the mayor), don’t lend themselves to cute photos. But initiatives like those might begin to glue the mayor’s allies back together. Liza Featherstone lives and writes in Clinton Hill.

That's at least what city officials are saying after the Atascadero Planning Commission approved a one-year extension for the project’s parcel map on Aug. 16, yet again raising doubts about the retail giant’s commitment to Atascadero. Phil Dunsmore, Atascadero’s community development director, told New Times that the delay isn’t an indication that Walmart is reconsidering the project, but is related to the fact that the project is complicated and that parcel maps are only viable for two years after they’re submitted. “We had no other option except to ask for the extension, because their map expired about a month ago,” Dunsmore said. “It doesn’t mean they’re going to take that full year. It just means we get a few weeks or months to be able to finish up taking care of all their conditions.” One of those conditions was met on Aug. 9, when the City Council approved the formation of a Community Facilities District for Walmart to pay for site infrastructure, like streetlights and gutters. “It’s basically a tax on Walmart to pay for those things,” Dunsmore said.  He said previous years of uncertainty surrounding the project contributed to the parcel map time crunch. In 2015, Walmart was stuck awaiting approval from its corporate offices to move forward, Dunsmore said. Atascadero views Walmart as a valuable asset for tax revenue. The city would receive both property and sales taxes from the store if it gets built. But the project has received intense opposition from parts of the community since it was first proposed in 2006. “Plans did get delayed. It took them a lot longer than they thought,” he said.  Share: No place like ommm: Schools are incorporating mindfulness as a way to help children develop better Undocumented immigrants and advocacy groups in North County are bracing for Trump's promised immigration policies Defining joint rules: Cities, counties, and federal government agencies grapple with state laws regarding marijuana Political Watch 11/17/16 Despite spike in countywide voter registration, turnout in Santa Barbara County remained modest Solvang enacts soft water restrictions to curb salt content in groundwater County report recommends Santa Ynez Valley Airport Authority board members receive Brown Act training Home | News | Opinion | Arts & Events | Film | Food & Wine | Classifieds | Personals | Community | Outside | Special Issues | Archives | About Us | Advertising Copyright © New Times.

Police responded to the parking lot at about 6:50 p.m. on reports of a baby that had been alone in a car for about 20 minutes. When they arrived, they found a three-month-old boy alone in a car. The car had been left running with the air conditioner on and the baby showed no signs of distress, officers said. After further investigation, police discovered that the infant's mother left the child in the car while she went into Walmart to shop. The child's mother, Selena Gastelo, 27, of Desert Hot Springs, was arrested on suspicion of felony child endangerment, according to police. The baby is being cared for by the Palm Springs Police Department until authorities can find a "responsible party" to take care of the child.

Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email DALLAS -- The Army reservist who killed five Dallas police officers last month showed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder after returning home from Afghanistan in 2014, but doctors concluded that he presented no serious risk to himself or others, according to newly released documents from the Veterans Health Administration. Micah Johnson had sought treatment for anxiety, depression and hallucinations, telling doctors that he experienced nightmares after witnessing fellow soldiers getting blown in half. He also said he heard voices and mortars exploding, according to the documents obtained by The Associated Press under the Freedom of Information Act.

Johnson, 25, was the sniper who targeted the officers at the conclusion of a peaceful march July 7 in downtown Dallas, where demonstrators were protesting fatal police shootings in Minnesota and Louisiana. Armed with an assault rifle, he took multiple positions as he fired. Hours later, authorities used a bomb-carrying robot to kill him. During his deployment, Johnson was largely confined to base in an area of Afghanistan that had seen heavy combat but that was relatively quiet when his unit arrived in November 2013, according to his former squad leader. Upon his return to the U.S. nine months later, Johnson told doctors he was experiencing panic attacks a few times a week, including once while at Wal-Mart, where there was an unspecified conflict that required a police response, the records said. “Veteran states hearing all the noises, fights and police intervening caused him to have palpitations, ‘My heart felt like someone was pinching it while it was beating fast,’” the records state. Johnson said he began shaking, felt short of breath and got chills following the Wal-Mart incident. The records do not show that Johnson was formally diagnosed with PTSD. The type of screening that he underwent is typically a first step to determine if the patient should be referred for further assessment to a mental health professional, said Joel Dvoskin, a clinical and forensic psychologist in Tucson, Arizona. Doctors eventually decided that Johnson presented a low risk for suicide or for hurting anyone else. Johnson was “not acutely at risk for harm to self or others,” according to a medical record from a visit on Aug. 15, 2014. The patient was “not felt to be psychotic by presentation or by observation.” 26 Photos Police ambushed in Dallas Law enforcement officers are targeted in downtown Dallas as a peaceful protest against police shootings turns to chaos The reservist who specialized in carpentry and masonry told health care providers he had lower back pain and was avoiding “crowds of people and when in the public, scanning the area for danger, noting all the exits, watching everyone’s actions.” “I feel like I can’t trust all of these strangers around me,” Johnson told his doctor, who noted that he had taken to drinking since his return to Dallas, consuming three to four shots of vodka up to three times a week. “It’s hard for me to be around other people and I am so angry and irritable.” Records from the Aug. 15 visit state that Johnson described his childhood as “stressful.” His responses to a section of the form titled “Sexual/Physical/Emotional Abuse History” were redacted. Johnson was also advised to talk with a health care worker about erectile dysfunction. Johnson was prescribed a muscle relaxant, an antidepressant and anti-anxiety and sleep medication, and a nurse offered him tips on managing anger, records show.

He had previously told providers he planned to find a job in construction and that his long-term goal was to become a self-defense instructor. Johnson’s mother, Delphene Johnson, has said her son sought medical care from the VA for a back injury but got no help after filling out forms and going to meetings. He “just finally gave up,” she told TheBlaze, a news site founded by conservative talk show host Glenn Beck.

News Sports Entertainment Life Opinion Obituaries E-edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site 1985-Present 1831-1950 Esther Cepeda: One man's clutter could be another man's treasure Wednesday Aug 24, 2016 at 8:01 PM CHICAGO — In a recent op-ed piece, Stephanie Land characterized the de-cluttering craze, popularized by Marie Kondo's best-selling "The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up," as a form of class-based scorn. "In a new documentary about the movement, ‘bad' consumption is portrayed by masses of people swarming into big-box stores on Black Friday, rushing over one another for the best deals," wrote Land, a fellow at the Center for Community Change, in The New York Times. "They are, we're led to understand, slaves to material goods, whereas the people who stay away from mass consumption are independent thinkers, free to enjoy the higher planes of life. But those people flocking to Wal-Mart ... are people teetering on or even below the poverty level, desperate for comfort in their homes. To point to them as a reason to start an anti-consumerism movement is just another form of social shaming." I agree — there's a lot of hype tinged with snobbery. The minimalism movement has become what Kyle Chayka calls "Silicon Valley's version of Zen monkhood." Writing in The New York Times Magazine, Chayka nailed Land's discomfort: "Minimalism is now conflated with self-optimization. ... The movement, such as it is, is led in large part by a group of men who gleefully ditch their possessions as if to disavow the advantages by which they obtained them. But it takes a lot to be minimalist: social capital, a safety net and access to the internet." Still, as someone who lives in an area where the Wal-Mart is only a mile from the local Goodwill thrift store, I have a very different take on it: Kondo's approach may be a conceit of the upper class, but it has undoubtedly enriched the lives of all the working-class people who are lucky enough to live near high-quality second-hand-goods stores. From the perspective of someone who has been going to Goodwill every Saturday morning since my local store opened in 2011, Kondo's "Life-Changing Magic" has brought a lot of high-priced glee to a neighborhood whose poverty rate reached almost 21 percent in the years after the Great Recession. What this means for a low-income family with school-aged children is that when back-to-school time comes around, a mom can usually find new, often-times very high-quality name-brand clothes and shoes — plus extremely cheap, practically new school supplies like scissors, loose-leaf notebook paper, folders, rulers and required paperbacks like "To Kill a Mockingbird" or "The Great Gatsby" — for pennies on the dollar. These families then take the savings from having purchased donated goods down the street to Wal-Mart for the licensed-cartoon-character brand lunchboxes, backpacks and other supplies the kids simply can't do without for the start of school. Plus, some of the nation's top thrift store chains do more than just offer super-nice goods on the cheap. The Salvation Army, for instance, funds adult rehabilitation centers and programs that help people re-enter society and attain gainful employment in part through profits from the donated goods that are resold in their thrift stores. According to Charlene Sarmiento, the public relations program manager at Goodwill Industries International, people's donations help fund programs that educate and train veterans and military families, older workers and others entering the job market. The stores and associated programs provide real work experience and career counseling, computer classes, resume reviews, job interview training and specialized industry education to get people into jobs in their communities. Last year, Sarmiento said, "Goodwill placed 312,000 people in employment in the U.S. and Canada and nearly 2 million people worked to build their career and financial assets by engaging with Goodwill team members. In addition, more than 35 million people used computers and mobile devices to access Goodwill education, training, mentoring and online learning services to strengthen their skills." Sarmiento could not make a direct connection between the Kondo craze, which started after the book was published in the United States in 2014, and Goodwill's 4 to 7 percent increase in donations over the past two years but said, "We know that Kondo's book has been very popular and we encourage people who are de-cluttering to donate the items they no longer need to Goodwill. ... Many of our friends, family members and neighbors have been able to find jobs and care for their families through your donations to Goodwill."

Story continues below Micah Johnson had sought treatment for anxiety, depression and hallucinations, telling doctors that he experienced nightmares after witnessing fellow soldiers getting blown in half. He also said he heard voices and mortars exploding, according to the documents obtained by The Associated Press under the Freedom of Information Act. “I try to block those out, but it is kinda hard to forget,” Johnson told his care provider, according to the documents. Johnson, 25, was the sniper who targeted the officers at the conclusion of a peaceful march July 7 in downtown Dallas, where demonstrators were protesting fatal police shootings in Minnesota and Louisiana. Armed with an assault rifle, he took multiple positions as he fired. Hours later, authorities used a bomb-carrying robot to kill him.

Upon his return to the U.S. nine months later, Johnson told doctors he was experiencing panic attacks a few times a week, including once while at Wal-Mart, where there was an unspecified conflict that required a police response, the records said. “Veteran states hearing all the noises, fights and police intervening caused him to have palpitations, ‘My heart felt like someone was pinching it while it was beating fast,'” the records state. Johnson said he began shaking, felt short of breath and got chills following the Wal-Mart incident. The records do not show that Johnson was formally diagnosed with PTSD. WATCH: Funerals held for slain Dallas officers The type of screening that he underwent is typically a first step to determine if the patient should be referred for further assessment to a mental health professional, said Joel Dvoskin, a clinical and forensic psychologist in Tucson, Arizona. Doctors eventually decided that Johnson presented a low risk for suicide or for hurting anyone else. Johnson was “not acutely at risk for harm to self or others,” according to a medical record from a visit on Aug. 15, 2014. The patient was “not felt to be psychotic by presentation or by observation.” The reservist who specialized in carpentry and masonry told health care providers he had lower back pain and was avoiding “crowds of people and when in the public, scanning the area for danger, noting all the exits, watching everyone’s actions.” “I feel like I can’t trust all of these strangers around me,” Johnson told his doctor, who noted that he had taken to drinking since his return to Dallas, consuming three to four shots of vodka up to three times a week. “It’s hard for me to be around other people and I am so angry and irritable.” Records from the Aug. 15 visit state that Johnson described his childhood as “stressful.” His responses to a section of the form titled “Sexual/Physical/Emotional Abuse History” were redacted. Johnson was also advised to talk with a health care worker about erectile dysfunction. Johnson was prescribed a muscle relaxant, an antidepressant and anti-anxiety and sleep medication, and a nurse offered him tips on managing anger, records show. He also saw a psychiatrist and was further evaluated for his PTSD symptoms in September of that year, but the physician noted that his mood was “better.” READ MORE: Dallas police chief defends use of ‘bomb robot’ to kill suspected sniper Micah Johnson When providers called Johnson in October 2014, he requested to put off further assessment for PTSD, saying he was busy remodeling his mother’s house, according to the records.

Check out the best travel deals and destinations Opinion Beth Kassab: Eyes on solar tax break for a greener Florida Solar energy amendments demystified - Orlando News Now In less than a month voters will face the first of two state law changes regarding solar energy up for approval this year. In less than a month voters will face the first of two state law changes regarding solar energy up for approval this year. Beth KassabContact ReporterOrlando Sentinel Columnist Why Amendment 4 on solar power matters Solar is suddenly heating up in Florida. After years of little fanfare, the renewable energy source is finally getting more attention in this state than the latest possible tropical storm's cone of definite uncertainty. What a relief, right? With two solar amendments up for votes this year, a big push by new solar co-ops and investments from the big utilities, the Sunshine State must be on its way to ditching fossil fuels and going greener than a jar of slime from the old Nickelodeon Studios. Not exactly. Florida's solar forecast right now is still much like those tracking models for big storms — reliably unreliable. A lot still needs to happen for Florida to become a more viable solar market. And big businesses and the big utilities disagree on what those steps are. We'll get to that. First, a point on which most everyone agrees: Amendment 4. The question on Tuesday's ballot would extend tax breaks on renewable devices like solar panels to businesses.

The law, passed in 2009, is meant to protect homeowners who want to use plants and grasses in their yards that need less water and fertilizer than the typical lush St. Augustine lawn.   If the necessary 60 percent of voters answer yes on Amendment 4, there is wide agreement from the pro-business Florida Chamber of Commerce to the tree-hugging Sierra Club that Florida's solar market would improve. Al Sharpton, who flew into Miami earlier this month to rail against the amendment, is a rare exception. Sharpton seemed to be yearning to shake his fist at another big corporate tax break that would hurt the little guy. But his press conference veered into a strange and terse exchange with reporters when he couldn't explain how the amendment would harm people. The whole thing smacked of an activist who was woefully uninformed about what he was advocating against. Here's an example to help Sharpton out: If, say, Walmart wanted to add solar panels to its rooftops and generate some of its own power, it could do so without that equipment adding to its property tax bill if the amendment passes. It would be similar to the break homeowners who purchase panels already get on their taxes. Walmart happens to have 365 solar systems at stores across more than a dozen states and Puerto Rico. But none are in Florida. "We don't have any on-site solar installations at our stores in Florida right now, but we're always looking at opportunities to add solar at stores across the country where it makes economic sense," said Ragan Dickens, Walmart director of sustainability communications in an e-mail. Q&A: Shining light on solar amendments Gray Rohrer TALLAHASSEE – Voters this year are being offered the chance to approve two solar amendments, with major implications for businesses and the future of how Florida consumes energy. Like the first sunbeam rudely bursting through the window in the morning, the differing messages of the business groups,... TALLAHASSEE – Voters this year are being offered the chance to approve two solar amendments, with major implications for businesses and the future of how Florida consumes energy. Like the first sunbeam rudely bursting through the window in the morning, the differing messages of the business groups,... (Gray Rohrer) Companies like Walmart aren't investing in solar equipment in Florida because it doesn't make financial sense for them right now. So no current property tax revenue from those companies is at risk from Amendment 4. But the amendment could mean the start of more solar activity on the part of businesses. Thanks to tax breaks, reduced costs and programs offered by utilities, the number of homeowners using solar has increased, though they are still a faction of total power customers. Duke Energy Florida said about 3,600 of its 1.7 million customers are using their own rooftop solar panels today. That's a 400 percent jump from just five years ago, when Duke customers with solar numbered just about 700. And a surge in activity among solar co-ops, which pool homeowners together to bargain for a lower rate from solar installers, could mean more people opt for rooftop panels — still a significant investment of $10,000 to $20,000 depending on the home. A co-op in Orange County is attempting to sign up at least 500 people, though not everyone is expected to go through with purchasing the panels. All of that is good news for people who want to see solar become a bigger player in Florida. But there are no guarantees. The debate about a second solar amendment on the November ballot known as Amendment 1 is still at a low simmer and destined to boil over in the next couple months. That's the one that pits businesses against the utilities. More on that in the next few weeks. We'll have a better idea about solar's forecast in Florida after Tuesday. bkassab@orlandosentinel.com Privacy Policy Copyright © 2016, Orlando Sentinel Advocates pitch sunny future for solar Solar power amendment makes ballot Solar: 'Yes' in August — but 'no' in November All Sections News Sports Business Classified Entertainment Travel Obituaries 78°

Confirming that Welspun supplies a number of products to Walmart, a spokesperson of the US retail major said, “We are currently reviewing Welspun cotton certification records and plan to have additional conversations with Welspun. If we discover an issue, we will handle it appropriately.” After an extensive investigation, Target Corporation confirmed that Welspun, that uses Egyptian cotton to make bedsheets and pillowcases sold by the retailer, substituted another type of non-Egyptian cotton when producing these sheets between August 2014 and July 2016. Target is Welspun India’s biggest customer after Bed Bath and Beyond. It accounted for about $90 million, or 10 percent of the company’s total business in the financial year through March. “We have informed Welspun that, due to this conduct, we are in the process of terminating our relationship with them,” Target Corp said. Welspun, however, said that it was investigating the product specification issue and would hire one of the ‘Big Four’ accountancy firms to review its supply processes. Welspun India’s market capitalisation has eroded by a whopping Rs 4,376 crore from  21 August to Rs 5958 crore on 24 August.

Safeway is launching grocery delivery in the Denver metro area, joining King Soopers, Walmart and third-party providers like Instacart in offering the increasingly popular service. Starting Wednesday, customers of both Safeway and Albertsons (both chains are owned by the same parent) can log onto shop.safeway.com, fill up their virtual grocery carts and have their order delivered to their homes within a one-, two- or four-hour window. The delivery area currently includes most of metro Denver, from Lone Tree to Boulder, including Denver, Aurora, Thornton, Northglenn, Westminster, Broomfield, Lafayette, Arvada, Wheat Ridge, Lakewood, Littleton, Englewood, Centennial and Highlands Ranch. “The plan is to expand to other parts of Colorado, but this is our first go of it here,” Safeway spokeswoman Kris Staaf said. “We’ve had the service in other markets like California, Washington and Oregon, and it’s been tremendously successful.” Customer demand was a driving force in the decision to expand the service into Denver. “We had more requests for home delivery in Denver than any other city Safeway serves,” Denver division president Todd Broderick said in a statement. Groceries will be delivered by a fleet of more than dozen new trucks. The refrigerated trucks are equipped with multiple temperature zones so frozen pizzas stay frozen and fresh veggies stay crisp. “E-commerce is big business,” Staaf said. “To be able to offer this to our customers in the Denver metro area is really exciting.” Tags:  Albertsons grocery stores King Soopers Safeway Walmart Emilie Rusch Emilie Rusch covers commercial real estate and retail for The Post.

The trust unloaded 3.5 million shares at prices ranging from $72.45 to $74.28 on Aug. 19 and 22, according to a regulatory filing. Those transactions follow $104 million of sales at the end of June at prices between $70.67 and $71.86. Shares of the retailer have climbed this year after closing at a four-year low of $56.42 in November. Seventy-seven percent of analysts tracked by Bloomberg have a hold rating on the stock, with an average 12-month price target of $73.68. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Walton Enterprises, the family's main investment entity, distributed about 6 percent of the shares to the trust in April 2015. The family said in a statement that it expects to sell shares from time to time to help fund charitable contributions and offset possible further increases in its ownership percentage as a result of the company's stock buyback programs. The trust now owns about 170 million shares of the business, the filings show. That's a fraction of the 1.4 billion shares held by Walton Enterprises. Together the two entities own 51 percent of the retailer. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart and the Walton family directed Bloomberg to the April 2015 statement.   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Salt Lake City police cancel Amber Alert for 3-year-old girl who is found safe in Hawaii BYU football: RB coach Reno Mahe's daughter clings to life after hanging accident Ed Kimball, who wrote warts-and-all biographies of his father, Mormon leader Spencer Kimball, dies | Utah lawmaker accuses charter school of skirting procurement law President Obama honors Robert Redford with America's top civilian award ELEVATE During National Alzheimer’s Disease Awareness Month the Focus is Keeping Caregivers Healthy   Life is a Peach at the SALT Awards   Salt Lake Regional Medical Center First in the U.S. to Perform Meniscus Replacement   Contests and Promotions COMMENTS POST A COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

By Mark Znidar The Columbus Dispatch  •  Thursday August 25, 2016 12:04 AM The Clippers must feel like they have seen as much traffic go through the clubhouse doors as a greeter sees at Wal-Mart because of injuries, call-ups, releases, trades and others opting out of their contracts. There also have been only five days off other than the three-day all-star break, but the Clippers clinched their third straight International League West championship Wednesday. Shawn Morimando threw six innings of three-hit ball, Tommy Hunter, Craig Stammen and Cody Anderson each pitched a scoreless inning of relief and Michael Choice hit a two-run home run to lead the Clippers to a 3-1 victory over the Indianapolis Indians at Victory Park. The Clippers (78-54), who won their ninth straight game and 10th in 11 games, have been in first place for all but two days since June 28. Twelve games remain in the regular season before the Clippers begin pursuit of a second straight Governors’ Cup championship, a fourth since 2010 and 11th overall. The team has soldiered on despite 217 player transactions that included seeing all-star pitchers Mike Clevinger and Shawn Armstrong and infielder Michael Martinez called up to the Cleveland Indians. Catcher Adam Moore, 32, has played with Seattle, Kansas City, San Diego and Cleveland and yearns for another chance at the big leagues. That hasn’t distracted him from the job at hand. “We come together as a group regardless of the transactions and regardless of who is here,’’ Moore said. “We’ve just got a great group of guys. We grind every day — we just grind — and we are a family.” Moore saluted fourth-year manager Chris Tremie for bringing the players together. There have been two four-game losing streaks and an eight-game losing streak, but the team has been consistently strong since mid-July. “Tremie has got this team taking pride, from player one through 25, in what we do,’’ Moore said. “He gets us prepared and ready to play every single game.” Choice hit a two-run homer in the third inning. Rodriguez drove in the third in the fifth. That’s all Morimando (5-1) needed. He gave up one run, walked one and struck out five. Morimando began the season with double-A Akron but was promoted to Cleveland on July 2 after the Indians pitching staff was depleted during a 19-inning victory at Toronto. He has kept up the solid work for the Clippers. Anderson got his first triple-A save by striking out the side in the ninth. He began the season with Cleveland but was sent to the Clippers after a rocky start. mznidar@dispatch.com @MarkZnidar   mznidar@dispatch.com @markznidar Favorite Print Story Advertisement • Place an ad Sports Video More Videos Advertisement • Place an ad Explore Columbus Search Businesses Featured Businesses Loading...

CNN Money2:31 UP NEXT A year ago, it seemed like Wal-Mart might end up just another victim of Amazon's e-commerce dominance. Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 70.78 +0.66 +0.94% Tesla Motors Inc TSLA ▲ 195.09 +3.92 +2.05% However, as WMT’s second-quarter earnings report revealed, Walmart may not have to beat AMZN to thrive. Second Place Good Enough For WMT While there’s no denying the secular retail shift to e-commerce, AMZN isn’t necessarily the grim reaper for all traditional retailers. Walmart seems to be a perfect example. 7 Best Dividend Stocks You Haven’t Heard Of Other retailers like Target, Macy's and Gap are clearly struggling to figure out how to compete with AMZN. However, WMT just delivered positive overall sales growth, 3% U.S. sales growth, 1.6% same-store sales growth and 12% EPS growth. That is certainly not the kind of quarter you’d expect from a dying company. WMT stock is also trading near its 52-week high. Let’s be clear — Walmart is not beating Amazon. But that’s OK. “No one catches Amazon online,” Moody’s analyst Charlie O’Shea says. “The key is to be No. 2.” WMT’s online sales growth numbers were nowhere near AMZN’s numbers, but WMT still reported 11.8% digital sales growth in Q2. WMT Turning The Corner? One of the most difficult things for investors to identify is the exact inflection point when a struggling business turns the corner. WMT’s Q2 numbers seem to suggest that its turnaround strategy is working. But one quarter of good numbers is not a trend. WMT’s same-store sales growth of 1.6% is its strongest quarterly number since 2013. WMT’s online sales growth represents the first quarterly uptick following nine consecutive quarters of declines. Still, there are plenty of causes for concern. WMT’s U.K. operations remain a problem. Same-store sales in the U.K. plummeted 7.5% in Q2. Overall international sales were down 6.6%. Will Jet.com Be WMT’s E-Commerce Solution? Outside of WMT’s surprisingly upbeat Q2 earnings report, the biggest recent Walmart news has been a $3 billion buyout of Jet.com. Jet.com is only about a year old, but it has delivered impressive growth in that time. Jet.com’s sales have surged 168% from August 2015 to July 2016. Jet.com won’t be taking down Amazon anytime soon. However, it could be the key to Walmart establishing a solid number two position in the U.S. e-commerce market. First, Walmart added the creative vision of innovative Jet.com CEO Marc Lore. Forrester analyst Sucharita Mulpuru recently called Lore the biggest asset in Walmart’s acquisition. “What Walmart needs is an innovation machine that consistently is putting out something new every week,” Mulpuru added. Not only will Jet.com’s business model benefit from Walmart’s vendor relationships, Jet.com gives WMT something it has badly needed: an exciting e-commerce brand. Walmart has spent decades building one of the strongest brands in the world. However, that brand does not represent technology, e-commerce and innovation. No matter what the company does to make Walmart.com better, it will be very difficult for the site to compete with Amazon on reputation. Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA): The Boring Story You Shouldn’t Ignore Jet.com gives Walmart a blank state to get behind an exciting new brand that is synonymous with e-commerce. Jet.com may have gotten off to a late start in its quest to be the top Amazon alternative, but it now has the full weight of Walmart behind it. As of this writing, Wayne Duggan did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT), Kroger’s biggest rival for supermarket customers in most of its major markets, has seen its results rebound. Its stock is on the rise, and the quarterly earnings it reported late last week show Wal-Mart is targeting Kroger (NYSE: KR) and other traditional supermarkets to regain some of the market share that slipped. “Wal-Mart is going on the offensive,” Jim Hagerty, a principal and investment adviser with downtown-based money management firm Bartlett & Co., told me.

That is one of the largest commercial clean energy deals – ever. The Times reports: “In the United States, the generating capacity of corporate clean energy projects has more than doubled each year since 2013, according to the Business Renewables Center at the Rocky Mountain Institute, which tracks publicly announced deals. In 2015, 11 companies signed up for 3.23 gigawatts’ worth of projects, roughly the equivalent of five coal plants and up from 1.18 gigawatts the year before.”   Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Discuss this Article 0 Post new comment Name: Sign In or register to use your TDWorld ID Email: Your comment: * Advertisement Related Articles The Big Apple Goes Green Bringing Solar to the Big Apple Apple Asks FERC to Sell Power at Market-Based Rates Supermarkets See Green Energy Growth LA's Novel Green Finance Mechanism Connect Subscribe to The Energy Times Newsletter Subscribe Advertisement LATEST ON ENERGY TIMES Nov 3, 2016 Article Energy Times Brand Bold New Power Vision at Empowering Customers & Cities 2016 Jeremy Rifkin opened up the Empowering Customers & Cities 2016 executive conference with a keynote speech that was part warning, part call to action, and part invitation to rethink the way America generates, buys, sells, and delivers its energy...More Aug 18, 2016 Sponsored Energy Times Brand ABB announces 2016 Automation & Power World digital conference for the power industry ABB Automation & Power World has announced additional details for its upcoming APW digital conference....More Aug 17, 2016 News T&D World Magazine DOE Calls for More Investment for U.S. Energy Emergency Response In his testimony before a field hearing, U.S. Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz called for increased investments in U.S. energy emergency response....More Mar 13, 2016 IdeaXchange T&D World Magazine A Different Game Recently, I had the opportunity to watch the U.S. national rugby team play Canada in an international match....More Feb 29, 2016 Article Buildings Are Getting Energy Savvy 1 Building operators are ready to start deploying automated products that will steeply slash their energy consumption, says a government official....More Webinars Spacer Cable vs. Tree Wire Substation Reality Modeling: A New Solution for an Old Problem How to Stay Above Water While Working NERC CIP Cyber Compliance: Driving Cyber Security Priorities  More Webinars Advertisement White Papers Transformer Testing Techniques and Standard Development Enabling a Secure, Reliable and High Performing Field Area Network with Cellular Technology An Assessment of Polyethylene Insulator Performance  More White Papers T&DW Learning Center Handbook of Energy Engineering Calculations SOLVE ENERGY PROBLEMS QUICKLY AND ACCURATELY American Electrician's Handbook Sixteenth Edition For a century, the American Electricians' Handbook has served as the definitive industry reference for...

State police were already on location when the responding officer noticed a strong odor of marijuana and reportedly found a marijuana pipe and a switchblade in the individual’s purse. She was placed under arrest by state police for allegedly driving while intoxicated Thursday, Aug. 11 • Police observed a vehicle parked on the side of the roadway on Hinchey Avenue. The driver was slumped over and unresponsive. Police saw a hypodermic instrument in his lap and when they were able to wake the driver, he was removed. Police also found a substance in the vehicle suspected to be heroin. The driver was taken into custody, and his car was towed. Friday, Aug. 12 • A woman was suspected of stealing at Wal-Mart. She reportedly abandoned her shopping cart full of merchandise when she realized she was being watched. When she took her cellphone out of her purse, two packages of false eyelashes were visible. Wal-Mart personnel said the woman has stolen from the store before and plan to complete a case file with video. Sunday, Aug. 14 • An officer observed a car pulling out of a gas station with the front end damaged and missing the passenger side front headlight. When running the plates, the officer realized the driver’s license had been suspended. The driver claimed he thought the suspension started on Aug. 16 but was issued tickets and his plates were confiscated. • Police responded to a complaint of larceny. An individual allegedly stole two cans of Four Loko by tucking them under his shirt. When caught, he returned them to the store clerk but will be facing charges. Monday, Aug. 15 • Officers conducted a traffic stop on Central Avenue near West Drulland for a vehicle suspected of having a suspended registration.

The stock had been in the 20% lower circuit limit in the previous two trading sessions. (PTI) Home textile maker Welspun India slumped for a third consecutive day as the issue surrounding an inferior bedsheet variant supplied to one of its customers, Target, has now seen another client Wal-Mart ordering a review. Welspun shares hit the 10% circuit limit on Wednesday at Rs 59.30, a 52-week low. The stock had been in the 20% lower circuit limit in the previous two trading sessions. The sell-off over the past two sessions has wiped off Welspun India’s market cap by over Rs 3,500 crore. The crisis broke after Target, Welspun’s second largest customer, said the company had supplied a variety of bedsheet substituting Egyptian cotton with a cheaper type of cotton. Due to this violation of code of conduct, Target said, it was in the process of ending all business with Welspun. On Tuesday, world’s largest retailer Wal-Mart, which is also one of its customers, said it is also reviewing Welspun’s cotton certification records. “If we discover an issue, we will handle it appropriately,” it said. Welspun India reported a consolidated revenue of Rs 5,937 crore for year-ended March 2016. US customers account for two-third’s of its business. Apart from Target, which accounted for 10% of its business, Welspun’s US customers include Wal-Mart, Bed & Bath and Beyond, Macy’s and JC Penney. Welspun has already announced that it is “appointing one of the big four external auditors to audit supply systems and processes. This is an issue of highest priority for us and we will take all necessary steps to address it.” A mail sent to Welspun on Wednesday seeking further clarifications didn’t elicit a response. “ Export is a big business for Welspun so the implications of this could be huge. If the particular product was also shipped to other clients, this crisis could worsen,” said an analyst at a local brokerage. Edelweiss Securities expects the loss of the contract with Target will lead to a fall in Welspun’s earnings per share for FY17 and FY18 by 11% and 14% respectively. Another brokerage Elara Securities too sees Welspun’s earnings falling by 22%.

Target has alleged that Welspun has been selling cheap cotton products to it under the guise of Egyptian cotton for the past two years, between August 2014 and July 2016. On its corporate website Target said," This was a clear violation of both Target’s Code of Conduct and our Standards of Vendor Engagement, and was contrary to the high ethical standards to which we hold ourselves, and our vendors." Target Corp has even gone to the extent of offering a full refund to its customers who have purchased products from its outlets from August 2014 and July 2016. In a BSE release Welspun has said, "We have initiated immediate actions to investigate the root cause. We are appointing an external auditor (one of the big four) to audit our supply systems and processes. This is an issue of highest priority for us and we will take all necessary steps to address it." Other clients to follow suit? Welspun is a major supplier to retailers like Walmart, JCPenny, Bed Bath & Beyond and Macy's. Post these allegations from Target, other retailers like JCPenny and Walmart have started their investigations in to the matter. On Tuesday, Walmart said that it is reviewing Welspun's cotton certification record and plans to hold additional dialogue with the company. Following Walmart's lead, American department store JCPenny has initiated an investigation to look in to products it bought from Welspun. The news of Target's allegations has caused a domino effect which may further aggravate Welspun's existing wounds if other retailers decide to choose the same path Target did. As market analyst, Ambareesh Baliga told CNBC-TV18 that it might be a genuine mistake (from Welspun's end), it is going to impact Welspun's business from other major global clients as well. A big chunk of Welspun's clients are from the US and this fiasco can hurt the company's credibility and raise questions on its business ethics.

Penney (JCP). Annie Palmer Aug 24, 2016 2:15 PM EDT NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Shares of Bed Bath & Beyond  (BBBY)  were higher in mid-afternoon trading on Wednesday as the Union, NJ-based home retail company is appointing an external auditor to review products from Welspun India. The auditor will confirm whether the Mumbai-based textile manufacturer's bedding products are made of Egyptian cotton. Welspun has come under fire for selling cheaper bedsheets as premium Egyptian cotton. The decision follows similar moves by Target (TGT) and Walmart (WMT), who also sell the company's sheets.  Target is pulling the items from its stores, while Walmart is investigating Welspun's cotton certification records.  J.C. Penney (JCP) said yesterday it is also conducting an investigation into Welspun's sheets. The company added that it's too early to "determine what actions may be necessary," Fortune reports.  Separately, TheStreet Ratings objectively rated this stock according to its "risk-adjusted" total return prospect over a 12-month investment horizon. Not based on the news in any given day, the rating may differ from Jim Cramer's view or that of this articles's author. TheStreet Ratings has this to say about the recommendation: We rate BED BATH & BEYOND INC as a Hold with a ratings score of C. The primary factors that have impacted our rating are mixed - some indicating strength, some showing weaknesses, with little evidence to justify the expectation of either a positive or negative performance for this stock relative to most other stocks. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its attractive valuation levels, good cash flow from operations and largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures. However, as a counter to these strengths, we also find weaknesses including deteriorating net income, disappointing return on equity and a generally disappointing performance in the stock itself.

Login Search Wal-Mart Reviews Welspun Records as Target Ends Business August 24, 2016, 07:06:00 AM EDT By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com Shutterstock photo Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT has reportedly started reviewing cotton certification records of Welspun India, one of its bedsheet suppliers, after peer Target Corp. TGT pulled its Welspun products from shelves, following the discovery that they were mislabeled. Welspun makes towels, sheets, rugs and carpets for 18 of the top 30 global retailers. It manufactures one out of every five towels sold in the U.S. and sells to major customers like J.C. Penney JCP and Macy's, Inc. M , according to Bloomberg. Wal-Mart is Welspun's third-biggest customer, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Welspun currently supplies a number of products, including sheets, to Wal-Mart. However, currently, Welspun is undergoing investigations by Wal-Mart after Target terminated all business with the Indian supplier last week. Welspun India's shares plunged 20% on Tuesday after the announcement. Target stated that its extensive investigation confirmed that Welspun had been selling cheaper sheets and pillowcases as premium Egyptian cotton. Egyptian cotton has a longer fiber that creates a softer thread compared to other cotton. It often carries a higher price because shoppers consider it to be of better quality. WAL-MART STORES Price and Consensus WAL-MART STORES Price and Consensus | WAL-MART STORES Quote Welspun, on its part, said that it was investigating the product specification issue and would hire a Big Four accountancy firm to review its supply processes. The Indian company fears the loss of other customers like Wal-Mart after Target's withdrawal. The Bentonville, AR-based retail giant plans to hold additional conversations with the supplier, and take a call if any issues are discovered. Wal-Mart currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Textile sourced from the company is currently being investigated by global retail majors Walmart and JCPenney for product integrity. (File photo) Global retail majors Walmart and JCPenney are investigating textiles sourced from Welspun India for product integrity, while IKEA is awaiting the outcome of a probe by the Indian firm in the wake of lapses in its supplies to US-based Target. “JCPenney is conducting a thorough investigation of its Welspun textiles to ensure the integrity of its product claims,” a company spokesperson said in a statement. It further said JCPenney suppliers of private and exclusive brand products are required to certify the quality compliance of any raw materials used and, when sourcing Egyptian cotton, manufacturers must provide a certificate issued by the Cotton Egyptian Association as an additional measure of authenticity. On what actions could be taken, the spokesperson said: “It is too early in our review process to determine what actions may be necessary.” A Walmart spokesperson said: “We are currently reviewing Welspun cotton certification records and plan to have additional conversations with Welspun. If we discover an issue, we will handle it appropriately.” A spokesperson of the Swedish furniture retailer IKEA on the other hand said: “To our knowledge and according to our continuous verifying processes, the supplier delivers according to our agreements.” The spokesperson further said: “However, we will follow their ongoing investigation carefully and await the outcome. Until then our business collaboration continues as usual.” IKEA does not buy products made from Egyptian cotton. From the end of fiscal 2015, IKEA reached the goal of 100 per cent cotton from more sustainable sources and Egypt does not have sustainable cotton programs related to Cotton from more sustainable sources, the statement added. Welspun, which was supplying bedsheets and pillowcases made of Egyptian cotton to Target, was alleged by the US-based retailer for substituting another type of non-Egyptian cotton when producing sheets supplied between August 2014 and July 2016. Target has since then decided to terminate its contract with Welspun after an investigation. Welspun on its part has said it has initiated immediate actions to investigate the root cause and was appointing an external auditor to audit its supply systems and processes. Target had said that as soon as its investigation confirmed the substitution, it pulled all remaining product from Target stores and Target.com. “We have informed Welspun that, due to this conduct, we are in the process of terminating our relationship with them,” Target Corp said.

This 1986 Movie inspired set includes beautiful redeco's of Ultra Magnus (CW Leader), Arcee (Generations Deluxe), Springer (Generations Voyager), Kup (Generations Deluxe), and Blurr (Generations Deluxe). History shows us that that a Platinum set being listed at Wal-Mart.ca usually means it will be exclusive there, whereas in the States it is likely to appear in a number of different stores. Also keep in mind this set is in "low stock" but it is known to fluctuate in and out of stock. What do you think of this set, it's deco's, and inherent cost?

That seems kinda cheap to me. I might get this if I see it. I kinda wish they would recolor Minimus Ambus to look like Daniel. I think it'd complete the set. Re: Transformers Generations Platinum Edition Autobot Heroes Set Listed At Wal-Mart.ca (1818327) Posted by mblase75 on August 24th, 2016 @ 2:33pm CDT I wonder why they didn't repaint Minimus Ambus into Daniel. Re: Transformers Generations Platinum Edition Autobot Heroes Set Listed At Wal-Mart.ca (1818334) Posted by Kurona on August 24th, 2016 @ 2:58pm CDT I wonder why they included Minimus at all when Nightstick was removed from Cyclonus in his Platinum set Re: Transformers Generations Platinum Edition Autobot Heroes Set Listed At Wal-Mart.ca (1818337) Posted by Decepticon Stryker on August 24th, 2016 @ 3:05pm CDT Kurona wrote:I wonder why they included Minimus at all when Nightstick was removed from Cyclonus in his Platinum set Well since these are based on the movie which came out before Nightstick I think they just wanted to keep in continuity. That doesn't answer why Minimus is there but does provide a possible reason forr Nightstick's absence. Re: Transformers Generations Platinum Edition Autobot Heroes Set Listed At Wal-Mart.ca (1818338) Posted by william-james88 on August 24th, 2016 @ 3:05pm CDT Kurona wrote:I wonder why they included Minimus at all when Nightstick was removed from Cyclonus in his Platinum set Because Nightstick is not integral to Cyclonus, he's just an accessory. You wouldnt know you were missing out unless you had him. Minimus is another matter since there is an actual control panel and chair inside Ultra Magnus' chest. Plus, Magnus' head doesnt connect to the bottom, minimus serves as the neck between the Magnus helmet and the chest in terms of the anatomy of the toy's robot mode. Re: Transformers Generations Platinum Edition Autobot Heroes Set Listed At Wal-Mart.ca (1818349) Posted by Black Hat on August 24th, 2016 @ 3:51pm CDT All I really want is that Arcee. And maybe Springer and Ultra Magnus, maybe. I've already got Prime Kup (who's good enough for my purposes) and I don't like that mold as Blurr. Hopefully someone will sell Arcee separately for a sensible price. Re: Transformers Generations Platinum Edition Autobot Heroes Set Listed At Wal-Mart.ca (1818358) Posted by RAR on August 24th, 2016 @ 4:04pm CDT Arcee is missing her guns - shame that.. Re: Transformers Generations Platinum Edition Autobot Heroes Set Listed At Wal-Mart.ca (1818365) Posted by -Kanrabat- on August 24th, 2016 @ 4:28pm CDT A bit expensive, but anyone who don't have any of these mold should defenitely go for it.

Which is... odd, considering she didn't have swords in the movie but did have guns. Re: Transformers Generations Platinum Edition Autobot Heroes Set Listed At Wal-Mart.ca (1818371) Posted by Omegatrion84 on August 24th, 2016 @ 5:05pm CDT This set looks really great. I will most likely be picking this up. That being said I do have a few nitpicks with it. Since they included Minimus Ambus why not repaint him as Daniel in his Exo-suit? I'm not a huge fan of the Drift mold repainted into Blurr. The new Titans Return Blurr painted like Takara's would have been perfect. Lastly Arcee didn't get her hand blaster which was in the movie, yet they gave her the IDW swords instead? Also Hasbro seems to have this weird hang up with painting her "bikini bottom" all pink, instead only painting the top half and leaving the bottom white which makes it look more like a belt. This is probably a stock image as I saw Arcee out of package on display at Botcon this year painted as she looks in the movie but the in package figure was presented like she is here. Re: Transformers Generations Platinum Edition Autobot Heroes Set Listed At Wal-Mart.ca (1818433) Posted by Delicon on August 24th, 2016 @ 10:22pm CDT Two thoughts, both on the same general idea. 1) We've had quite a few Kups by now, why are none of them in animation a curate gray colors? 2) I absolutely hate that Blurr head and have since it was first introduced. Since you're going for a movie accurate Blurr and you're limited to repaints, I would have personally used Cybertron Blurr as the head is dead one. Sure, the vehicle mode is pretty different from movie Blurr but no worse than Generations Blurr is.

It's very short, has no leg articulation, and how would you explain away his Cyber Planet key and flight mode? All for what, a better head? Of all the Blurr figures they've made that one is the worst representation.

The body is made to resemble the bulky attire of a samurai which, while Blurr should be sleeker and way less bulky. Plus that body is designed to make use of the doors folded as scabards but him coming with guns makes no use of this cool design. As for Cybertron Blurr, thats just a retool of Armada Blurr, one of the worst toys I ever held from one of the worst toylines. I rarely sell my toys since I got into collecting but I made an exception with that one. I didnt want that figure in my house.

"JCPenney is conducting a thorough investigation of its Welspun textiles to ensure the integrity of its product claims," a company spokesperson said in a statement. It further said JCPenney suppliers of private and exclusive brand products are required to certify the quality compliance of any raw materials used and, when sourcing Egyptian cotton, manufacturers must provide a certificate issued by the Cotton Egyptian Association as an additional measure of authenticity. On what actions could be taken, the spokesperson said: "It is too early in our review process to determine what actions may be necessary." A Walmart spokesperson said: "We are currently reviewing Welspun cotton certification records and plan to have additional conversations with Welspun. If we discover an issue, we will handle it appropriately." A spokesperson of the Swedish furniture retailer IKEA on the other hand said: "To our knowledge and according to our continuous verifying processes, the supplier delivers according to our agreements." The spokesperson further said: "However, we will follow their ongoing investigation carefully and await the outcome. Until then our business collaboration continues as usual." IKEA does not buy products made from Egyptian cotton. From the end of fiscal 2015, IKEA reached the goal of 100 per cent cotton from more sustainable sources and Egypt does not have sustainable cotton programs related to Cotton from more sustainable sources, the statement added. Welspun, which was supplying bedsheets and pillowcases made of Egyptian cotton to Target, was alleged by the US-based retailer for substituting another type of non-Egyptian cotton when producing sheets supplied between August 2014 and July 2016. Target has since then decided to terminate its contract with Welspun after an investigation. Welspun on its part has said it has initiated immediate actions to investigate the root cause and was appointing an external auditor to audit its supply systems and processes. Target had said that as soon as its investigation confirmed the substitution, it pulled all remaining product from Target stores and Target.Com. "We have informed Welspun that, due to this conduct, we are in the process of terminating our relationship with them," Target Corp said. Shares of Welspun India tanked 9.95 per cent on BSE, closing the day at Rs 59.30.

Mike Blake/Reuters/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of Many brick-and-mortar stores are watching their profits slowly crumble to the ground, thanks to the internet. With the ease of online shopping and fast, free shipping from subscription services like Amazon Prime  and Wal-Mart’s ShippingPass , some consumers are shying away from physical retail locations. Shoppers prefer stores to the web for now, but online shopping is growing at a fast pace. E-commerce sales jumped 15.5% in the first quarter of 2016 compared with a year earlier, while total retail sales increased by only 2.2% during that time, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce . Some companies are shutting down branches due to lack of profit. Kmart and Sears  are in the process of closing 78 locations, and Macy’s recently announced  plans to close about 100 stores. But retailers are finding creative ways to make in-store shopping more enticing and prevent it from becoming obsolete. Recommended: How secure is your data?

Here’s a look at some of their tactics, how they work to your advantage and where they fall short. 1. Interactive kiosks Retailers are attempting to turn stores into more engaging spaces by incorporating elements of the online shopping experience, including screens that mimic smartphones and computers. Macy’s  has tested kiosks in some of its top-performing department stores, including those at Easton Town Center in Columbus, Ohio, and New York’s Herald Square. These touch-screen centers perform a range of duties, from completing in-store pickups to providing tourism information. Kiosks can be helpful if you can’t find a sales associate or if you’d rather shop solo. The benefits: You can browse through merchandise and information and potentially complete transactions by yourself. And there’ll likely be no line, so you can get in and out of the store quickly. The drawbacks: In many ways, this experience is no better than shopping online — except, of course, you don’t get to sit on the couch in your pajamas. 2. Creating a cell phone haven Companies hope that if mobile users’ needs are met, they’ll spend more time — and money — in stores. Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic offer free Wi-Fi to shoppers. So do the Apple Store and Target . But Wi-Fi is no good unless your mobile device is charged enough to use it. Some businesses have you covered there, too. Through its partnership with ChargeItSpot, Neiman Marcus has installed phone-charging stations in a majority of its stores; customers can lock up their phones and charge them while they shop. The benefits: With a full battery and access to Wi-Fi, you can compare prices, browse your favorite websites and check your social media feed without eating up your data. The drawbacks: Retailers don’t always have the fastest internet connection. Plus, privacy is a concern. Is the network secure? Is the store collecting your data? Check the terms of use before you connect. 3. Apps and web tools Almost every retailer now has its own free app that shoppers can use at home and in stores. American Eagle Outfitters, Nordstrom, J.C. Penney  and Victoria’s Secret  are just a few examples. Apps can keep track of your coupons and rewards points at specific stores. With some, you can get reviews and more information about a product by scanning its bar code with your phone’s camera. If you’re in the store and an item is out of stock, these apps can tell you whether it’s available at other nearby locations. Macy’s is taking mobile use a step further. At 10 locations, the department store is rolling out a browser web tool dubbed Macy’s On Call, which uses IBM’s artificial-intelligence platform Watson as an in-store guide for shoppers. Customers can ask for directions to a certain product or department, and they’ll get an answer on their phone. The benefits: You’ll have all the resources you need at your fingertips. These tools make applying discounts and navigating the store more convenient. The drawbacks: Apps take up storage space on your phone, so they might not be worth downloading if you’re an infrequent shopper. And whether you use an app or your browser, retailers can track your shopping behavior for marketing purposes. 4. Smart fitting rooms At some stores, you’ll even find technology in the fitting rooms. For example, some have mirrors that let you create a virtual catalog of sorts, featuring yourself as the model. High-end retailer Neiman Marcus has installed full-length “memory mirrors” at select locations, including San Francisco’s Union Square. You just need to enter your email address and create a PIN to use them. These mirrors are more like screens that use cameras to capture pictures and shoot 360-degree videos, so shoppers can get a complete view of the outfits they try on. Customers can also scroll through inventory and send the images to their email addresses or share them with friends for a second opinion. Other places, like Bloomingdale’s, have tablets in their dressing rooms. These let customers find an item in another size or color or request help from an associate. The benefits: Smart mirrors let you compare ensembles side by side, and because they “remember” the images, you won’t have to try on the same outfit multiple times. Tablets are a little less high-tech but still offer convenience. The drawbacks: Again, security might be an issue. Stores have measures in place to protect your privacy, but they could be gathering data, and breaches do happen occasionally. 5. Mobile POS It’s become commonplace for staff to get in on the digital action as well. Chains across the nation, including Lowe’s and Nordstrom , have staff members equipped with mobile point-of-sale devices such as iPhones or tablets. Using these, they can search for inventory, scan price tags, place orders or swipe your credit card when you’re ready to check out. “Our hope is that we can use technology in a way that makes the experience a customer chooses as seamless as possible” says Evans, the Nordstrom public relations official. The benefits: The mobile POS enables fast, one-on-one customer service. It’s almost like having a personal shopper; associates can help you find what you’re looking for online if the store is out of stock or bring the register to you so you don’t have to wait in line. The drawbacks: You may feel pressured to transact, and the speedy checkout process means you’ll have less time to rethink your purchase. Why shop in stores? There’s no doubt that online shopping is convenient and efficient, but there are advantages to shopping in the physical world. Thanks to technological advances, you can shop smarter and more independently in stores than ever before, plus you still have the option to consult an employee if you need assistance. And you’ll get a truer sense of how an item looks, feels or fits in person than you will from a website. As long as shops feel e-commerce sales breathing down their necks, you can expect that they’ll work harder to improve your experience.

(NYSE: WMT), after meeting with key members of Walmart-U.S. and IR. "With 8/7 consecutive quarters of positive comps/traffic, momentum has clearly returned to Walmart-U.S," wrote Baird, stating that progress has been steady/broad-based across the store and country as investments in associates, processes, and price are working together to drive improved customer satisfaction and sales. According to the analysts, while absolute valuation metrics are nearing highs (~16.5x NTM P/E), relative reads (vs. S&P500/Staples) are more consistent with historical trends, and positive comp/traffic momentum appears poised to continue with several productivity initiatives still on tap. The analysts maintained their Outperform rating and $80 price target.

In so doing, Walmart broke nine quarters of slowing growth online and buoyed hopes that it is better equipped to compete with Amazon.com. Broadly speaking, the strong online performance was the result of years and billions of dollars in investment Walmart has made to bolster its digital offerings. Everything from the roll-out of its Walmart Pay mobile app, to expanding its free grocery pickup service for orders placed on line to launching an Amazon Prime-like subscription service. “The distinctions that we talk about today between stores, apps, pick-up, delivery and sites are continuing to blur into the background for customers. For them, it’s just Walmart,” Wal-Mart Stores CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement. Here are five Walmart digital initiatives that are behind its improved e-commerce fortunes: 1. Bigger assortment online 2. Online grocery 3. Prime-like subscription service 4. Walmart Pay 5.

The latter is conducting an investigation into the cotton supplied by Mumbai-based Welspun, a day after the world’s largest retailer, Walmart Corporation, started a similar probe.

Many believed a big-box store, like Costco or Walmart, would take the place of the 312-unit below-market-rate complex, but it remained a mystery. In March, City Paper reported LG had a “firm agreement with an anchor tenant” prior to announcing the evictions. And now, according to an announcement last month, it appears that anchor tenant is Whole Foods Market.  In response, a small group of advocates have decided to boycott the grocery store, citing what they see as a disregard for Pittsburgh’s affordable-housing struggles. “Do we need another Whole Foods more than the Penn Plaza residents needed the relationships and accessibility of being in centrally located affordable housing?,” says Joy KMT, who helped start the boycott effort. But will the Whole Foods boycott make a difference? So far, about 300 people have signed up for the boycott on Facebook, and KMT says the group may hold demonstrations. KMT says the group doesn’t have the capacity to “actively recruit” new members, but she welcomes more to join the Facebook group. “I think that we have to start looking at communities as more than an assortment of buildings and land to be developed,” says KMT. “If we begin with different questions, then we will end with different answers.” Whole Foods Market spokesperson Annie Cull is aware of the boycott and wrote in an email that Whole Foods “recognizes that this effort is a part of the overall conversation happening about the ongoing development of the neighborhood.”  “The East Liberty community has been going through a major revitalization over the last several years, and Whole Foods Market is a very small part of it,” she wrote. John Delaney, a University of Pittsburgh business-administration professor and labor expert, says while some boycotts have been more effective than others, the strategy overall has tended to have only “moderate” effectiveness. “The success of a boycott often depends on the salience of the issue in dispute to the people who might buy from a boycotted merchant,” Delaney wrote in an email to CP. “In the [Whole Foods case], the issue will be whether the dispute fueling the boycott of Whole Foods will be important enough to customers to create economic damage.”   CP talked to six shoppers at the current East Liberty Whole Foods on Centre Avenue (the grocer has indicated it will not keep both locations), and only half were aware of plans for a new store. Most cited more parking as a potential benefit of the new store. All said they would shop at the new location when complete, except for one respondent who said she preferred the current location because it was more “Shadyside-y.” Only one of the six was familiar with the Penn Plaza affordable-housing saga. When asked about potential problems with the new location, he said “You know what happened over there was bad,” before indicating that he would still shop at the new store. But should a boycott be directed toward Whole Foods, the property’s tenant, or LG, the owners? KMT says yes, considering Whole Foods’ stated mission to promote community involvement. Whole Foods’ website states, “Caring for the communities in which we reside is hugely important to our organization.” “I think that it would be important for Whole Foods to advocate for and protect vulnerable populations in the communities which they serve,” says KMT. “Whole Foods is actively seeking to profit from the displacement of families, and that is against the values that they have set forth to guide their company.” Whole Foods is not new to the neighborhood — the Centre Avenue location has been in East Liberty since 2002. But even though the store has been part of the area for more than a decade, KMT says its decision to express interest in and occupy the site that was the last unsubsidized, below-market-rate apartment complex in the neighborhood should carry weight. “Developments like this can’t work without the cooperation of many, from governmental agencies to private developers to corporations,” says KMT. “As an anchor store in East Liberty, the choices that Whole Foods makes absolutely do matter.” Cull, of Whole Foods, said that the company would not be leading a community-collaboration effort, but directed CP to LG’s larger plans for the former Penn Plaza site. Jonathan Kamin, the attorney representing LG, didn’t respond to request for comment on the developer’s plans.  Construction of the new East Liberty Whole Foods is slated for the first quarter of 2017.

Brian Stoffel (TMFCheesehead) Aug 24, 2016 at 6:30AM Image source: Getty Images Though many shoppers don't know it, Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT) e-commerce efforts have been under way for more than a decade. And while it is far and away the most powerful brick-and-mortar retailer in the world, its efforts to adapt in the age of the internet have lagged significantly behind those of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other competitors. Last year, the king of e-commerce generated six times more Internet-based revenue than Wal-Mart. That's a big reason why Wal-Mart is willing to fork over $3.3 billion in the recently announced acquisition of e-commerce start-up Jet.com. On the surface, the decision to acquire Jet seems logical: It shows investors that Wal-Mart is serious about upping its e-commerce game. Jet has shown remarkable growth in its one year of operations, particularly with urban millennials. With the acquisition, Wal-Mart gains access to (1) Jet's proprietary technology, which is responsible for offering customers attractive savings, and (2) Jet's accomplished CEO, Marc Lore. But the more time I spend thinking about it, the more I believe Wal-Mart is throwing money away -- and that's bad news for shareholders. Risk-taking 101, from a Nobel laureate Nobel laureate Daniel Kahnman's Thinking, Fast and Slow is a gold mine for those interested in behavioral economics. In one of the book's sections, he lays out a simple framework to understand when and why individuals (and companies) are willing to take risks -- particularly when they actually aren't in an individual's best interests. Imagine that you are given two options: 1. A guaranteed result 2. A bet for a more favorable outcome. The two variables at play are (1) how likely you are to win, and (2) whether you are gaining or losing money as a result.   ... for Gains ... for Losses High Probability ... 90% chance to win $100 or guaranteed $80 payout RISK AVERSE, accept payout 90% chance to lose $100 or guaranteed loss of $80 RISK SEEKING, go for bet Low Probability ...  10% chance to win $100 or guaranteed $15 payout RISK SEEKING, go for bet  10% chance to lose $100 or guaranteed loss of $15 RISK AVERSE, accept payout loss Author's version of graphic from Thinking, Fast and Slow, by Daniel Kahnman. Studies have found individuals typically exhibit the behavior that's in the bold, capital letters. Critically, that is the worse of the two choices on a strictly rational basis. For the purposes of this article, we are focused on the upper right-hand corner: a high probability for losses. If you have a 90% chance of losing $100, the value of taking that bet -- over time -- is negative $90 (90% times $100). It would be better for you to choose a guaranteed loss of $80. But Kahnmen says that we are suckers in our hope to avoid losses, and we're likely to reject this favorable guarantee. As he states [emphasis added]: "Many unfortunate human situations unfold in the top right cell ... Risk taking of this kind often turns manageable failures into disasters."  What this has to do with Wal-Mart I would argue that Wal-Mart is in the upper right-hand square when it comes to an e-commerce strategy. It is clearly losing to Amazon and doesn't have many options to stem the tide. While Wal-Mart's earnings, released earlier this month, showed encouraging growth in e-commerce, the long-term trends are still decidedly negative. More alarming, however, was the fact that Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon was willing to pay over $3 billion for Jet. To put that in perspective, Wal-Mart has $7.7 billion in cash on hand. Even though the company has strong free cash flow with over $21 billion over the past twelve months, that's 40% of the company's cash poured into the acquisition -- not an insignificant amount. And though Jet.com has shown remarkable growth, it is hard to imagine any path to profitability for the company. Even if it does achieve profitability, it is even harder to see that profitability significantly moving the bottom line at a massive company like Wal-Mart. Looking to the future Perhaps the most important metrics at play are sustainable competitive advantages. Amazon's raison d'etre is to be the best customer service company in the world, especially when it comes to order fulfillment and shipping speeds. To that end, it currently has 80 domestic fulfillment centers, with plans to add 32 more. As best I can tell, Jet only has two (in Kansas and New Jersey), and Wal-Mart has between seven and 12 . Those fulfillment centers are crucial, because they help guarantee that Amazon can get packages to Prime members as quickly as possible, typically two days or less. Wal-Mart and Jet fans are quick to point out that Jet also offers such guarantees on shipments from its fulfillment centers, and even for products not shipped from Kansas or New Jersey, Jet pressures third-party suppliers for similar guarantees. The problem is that the delivery and logistics game is rapidly changing. Five years from now, Amazon may be able to offer one-day shipping, or even same-day delivery. Drone deliveries get closer and closer to becoming a reality, and with over 100 locations, there's simply no way Wal-Mart or Jet could offer the same type of customer service from just 10 to 15 fulfillment centers. Some argue that Wal-Mart and other brick-and-mortar players could transition the use of their physical locations into quasi-fulfillment centers. Wal-Mart currently has over 780 million square feet of retail space domestically when Sam's Club is included. When Amazon's known build-out plan is completed, it will have just under 100 million square feet. It would seem that Wal-Mart has the upper hand. But what investors need to recognize is that the company would have to cannibalize its physical retail space -- the bread and butter that pays the bills -- in order to capitalize on such an opportunity. It would be a bold move, but management has given no concrete indications that it is a move the company is willing to make. In much the same way that we now find it unconscionable to wait 10 seconds for a website to load when just 10 years ago that seemed like lightning fast connectivity, I see a future where same-day or even next-hour delivery is the norm. Whether or not that actually pans out isn't the point: Amazon -- in addition to having a huge head start -- also has far more optionality to stay ahead in the e-commerce industry. At the end of the day, I'm not sure what the right move for Wal-Mart would be. But I do know that as far as shareholders are concerned, there's a high probability that Jet.com's $3 billion price tag will never be justified by additions to Wal-Mart's bottom line.
