In our Future of Retail 2017 report, PSFK Labs spoke with Tom Ward, Walmart’s Vice President of Central Operations, about how the company is encouraging its employees to take ownership of their work, enabling them to provide personalized service to customers. Below is a short excerpt from our interview. Download the full Future of Retail 2017 report to read the interview in full. PSFK: Which specific technologies are you using to transform the company’s organization? We put a lot of focus into our front-end and our innovation at the registers, so more evolution of the self‑scan register that allows customers that choose to use those to get in and out quickly and seamlessly. Scan & Go, which we have in certain stores, allows customers to scan their own merchandise as they go around and tap out quickly at the self‑scan registers. Any technologies that relate to increasing the speed of commerce in the box are really interesting to us. PSFK: Which tools are helping you engage and empower your employees? We’ve invested in new tools for associates on the sales floor, which are up‑rated versions of the tools that retailers have used in the past. They can scan items. They can get information about their business on the floor. We gave all of our store managers, area managers and market managers an iPad at our holiday meeting just over a year ago. The whole purpose was to keep them on the sales floor. My team led that group, and we built a lot of applications that are designed to replace paper‑based reports and keep them up to the minute so they can understand details about the business, and share those details in real time with their associates to help drive immediate change. Our Customer Experience application is one of those, which provides real-time access to data by hour of day, comments or letters that come through to the store. It really takes a lot of time out of that process and lets sales associates affect change in much more closer to real time than we would have done historically. PSFK: What are other ways that Walmart encourages its employees to feel ownership in their work? It’s not a secret that the business made an investment to back people, which is a journey we’ve been on for about 18 months. We put a number of department managers back into our organization. The pay information that we’ve worked on has been well documented, but what went with that was more ownership. We broke down what we call “the paths.” We gave more department managers smaller areas to look after to connect them to their business. We provided them the tools so that they could understand the success of that business. Built on a robust study of trends and patterns in the market, the Future of Retail 2017 report offers transformational strategies for a customer-first business.

What they discovered has undermined trust in a global luxury product and set off a salvo of class-action lawsuits that have created a king-sized public relations challenge for the Indian textiles industry and the U.S. companies it supplies. Turns out that major American retailers, including Target and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., have been selling premium-priced sheets purportedly made of Egyptian cotton -- a byword for luxury in linens -- but that may in reality be woven with lower-quality cotton blends. Three suits seeking to be certified as class-actions have been filed against supplier Welspun India Ltd. -- and a separate one last week was directed at Wal-Mart. The complaint, filed in New York by customer Dorothy Monahan, accuses the world’s largest retailer of questioning the fiber content of Welspun’s products as early as 2008, but not halting its sales until after Target did so in August. Wal-Mart said it will “vigorously defend” itself. The other lawsuits, all filed in the U.S. against Welspun, allege the company fraudulently labeled its bed sheets as Egyptian cotton. Welspun declined to comment on the suits. Managing Director Rajesh Mandawewala told analysts during a conference call in August that “the error is on our side so we have to take responsibility for it.” Target, meanwhile, hasn’t been sued. Popular Now More 'Must Have' Metrics to Drive Continuous Improvement Top 25 Supply Chains of 2016 OEE – Learn How to Use It Right “The marketing has created this image in our heads that high-quality cotton and Egypt are synonymous," said Louis Rose, a Memphis, Tennessee-based cotton industry consultant. “Consumers should be skeptical of these marketing claims. They’ll be under a lot more scrutiny now.” The fake Egyptian sheet episode came to light after exhaustive work by Target investigators who analyzed sheet fibers under microscopes and tracked their journey through a global supply chain. The probe found that 750,000 of Target’s "Egyptian cotton" sheets, sold for as much as $75 a pop, didn’t contain any Egyptian cotton at all, but an amalgam of lower-quality fibers from cheaper sources. That July discovery touched off a scandal spanning from Minnesota to Mumbai and Cairo that threatens the future of Welspun, part of a $3 billion conglomerate headed by entrepreneur Balkrishan Goenka. It may also hobble Indian textile manufacturers in the race to supply Western consumers with high-quality sheets and towels, creating an opening for competitors from China and elsewhere to grab the business, according to industry analysts. The Welspun-made sheets Target examined were sold under the Fieldcrest brand. While it has interests in steel, energy, and infrastructure, textiles are the bread and butter for Welspun, which says it supplies one in five towels sold in America and posted revenue of about $900 million in the 2016 fiscal year. Tennis stars like Roger Federer mop their brows with Welspun towels at the Wimbledon championships--a fact the company highlights in investor presentations. Target has cut ties and ended all of its $90 million in annual business with the company. Wal-Mart Stores and Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. also stopped selling Welspun sheets that had been labeled 100 percent Egyptian cotton. Those are significant blows coming from some of Welspun’s biggest customers, and have sent its stock down about 40% since Aug. 19 when Target announced its decision. The sheets fiasco reflects a simple reality: There’s a scarcity of Egyptian cotton. It first became a key export product in the early 19th century, when it arrived in France and became sought after for its silky feel. Production has been falling since the 1990s, however, and last year Egypt’s post-revolutionary military government ended subsidies for cotton farmers to shore up the state budget. A gradual decline in output has become a precipitous plunge. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates there will be a 53% decrease in production this year, to an all-time low of 160,000 bales. The system for certifying Egyptian cotton is administered from Cairo by the Cotton Egypt Association, an industry group that grants stamps of approval to suppliers of 100-percent Egyptian cotton products. To receive one, CEA executive director Khaled Schuman explained, a manufacturer pays an initial fee of $5,000 and submits records of Egyptian cotton purchases and product samples, which undergo DNA analysis to identify whether the fibers were grown in Egypt or elsewhere. The companies are charged an additional $3,000 annually for the certification, according to Schuman. But once a certification is granted, producers are mostly left alone until they need to renew their label a year later. “You can’t put an employee from the association on each production line to inspect” every item being produced, said Mohamed Negm, who conducts testing of certification samples for the association to verify the fibers are Egyptian-grown. Typically, suppliers like Welspun purchase cotton in raw form from Egypt for import to Asia, where it’s turned into finished products for sale in the U.S. and elsewhere, he said. The highest-quality Egyptian material costs twice as much as the standard grade sourced from India, providing a powerful incentive to cheat. “Factories have mixed the Egyptian cotton with other low quality cottons to make profit, which has ruined the reputation of Egyptian cotton,” said Negm, adding that’s what the DNA testing and certification aim to curtail. During the set-up of the CEA’s DNA testing program, Negm said, it started analyzing random samples taken from store shelves globally; 90% were fake, mixed with low-quality cottons from the likes of Sudan, Burkina Faso and Pakistan. “It’s very easy to play it loose during the production process if you want,” said Liu Dang Dang, a foreign sales manager at Chinese manufacturer Jihua 3542 Textile Co. U.S. retailers “should have realized how obvious it is,” he said, adding that the company, which supplies Egyptian cotton fabric to manufacturers in the U.S. and Europe, doesn’t engage in the practice. “The price they want to pay for Egyptian cotton sheets is so low when the price of Egyptian cotton is so high.” Widespread Blending » 1 2 Next Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

The division of Wal-Mart Stores has been around for 16 years, but the retailer’s growing emphasis on online sales has the Northwest Arkansas supplier community taking note of what happens at Walmart.com. Wal-Mart is serious about e-commerce growth, doling out more than $6 billion in investments since 2013, which includes the recent $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com. Executive recruiting firm Cameron Smith & Associates in Rogers said local supplier teams have gradually added more e-commerce expertise to their sales teams over the past couple of years. Sometimes the new personnel are located in the area but not always. Some suppliers have put e-commerce support staff in San Bruno, Calif., near Walmart.com. They did so because they could not find the right talent locally to add to their Northwest Arkansas Walmart sales teams, Smith said. The e-commerce talent pool — or lack thereof — in Northwest Arkansas is a problem. Smith said suppliers told his company that until they can find local talent, they will use home office staff and fly them into Bentonville for meetings. Smith said suppliers sometimes fill the positions from talent they developed internally, but it reflects additional resources they’ve invested in their Wal-Mart teams. Smith and his management group said there’s an opportunity for the University of Arkansas to better prepare retail students for the challenges of e-commerce, as well as brick and mortar. Bill Akins, vice president of business development at Rockfish in Rogers, agreed, saying the region needs to grow its online retail talent pool much the way it did with logistics and supply chain expertise for brick-and-mortar retail. SUPPLIER CHANGES LIKELY Akins said Wal-Mart supplier teams trained to focus on brick-and-mortar logistics and supply chain won’t likely meet the evolving challenges of working with the global retailer. He said shopper marketing positions were added a few years ago, but there is room for online and media expertise for the next version of omnichannel retail. “I have recently sat in [on] line reviews and other supplier meetings at Wal-Mart where the online strategy, and perhaps co-marketing opportunities are also discussed,” Akins said. “That’s if the supplier had their online/media representative in the room. Often they didn’t, because that person is based in their home office. I see that changing somewhat in the future.” Akins doesn’t think the Wal-Mart supplier teams will add many more personnel, but he said the jobs are likely to change as more of the business is shifted to online. “Supply chain analyst is an entry-level position in Vendorville,” he said. “It’s about making sure product gets from manufacturer to Walmart Distribution Centers and then out to stores. That position in the future will likely include some expertise on the e-commerce side of the business.” Akins said suppliers have invested in local teams trained in traditional retail but predicts future retail teams will also have some advertising agency experience and perhaps startup expertise. “Shopping today is no longer just pre-shop, shop and post shopping behavior,” he explained. “It’s about interacting with the consumer from the initial thought of a purchase through the time they get that purchase home and all points in between. The growth of mobile commerce will grow exponentially over the next four years as the Centennials — ages 10 to 20 — begin to enter the workforce. While Millennials use mobile in addition to other shopping formats, the younger generation will prefer mobile only for many of their purchases.” Akins said the vendor job of the future will be someone who can tackle seamless commerce because that’s where retail is going. “We don’t necessarily need a whole bunch of tech workers infiltrating the supplier teams,” he said. “But category managers of the future will have to understand how mobile and online commerce can be blended into their brick and mortar game plan.” ONLINE REMOVES STORE ADVANTAGES Akins said digital commerce used to echo what was happening in store and print circulars. Now, the opposite is true. “What you see in print and on the shelves echoes what is found online,” he said. Suppliers, Akins said, must become smarter in how they train staff. He said the largest suppliers, like Unilever and Kimberly Clark, have to understand the role they play as digital commerce grows. That is important because the way items are merchandised online is completely different than in store. “Think about the laundry soap category,” Akins said. “In the store you see a sea of orange [Tide] that dominates the shelves giving that supplier an advantage. Online that’s not what you see. A private label detergent gets the same play as those with the largest market share in stores.” He said online merchandising is all about content, words, reviews, photos, videos and testimonials which has to be curated by someone. That kind of expertise will be crucial to supplier teams in the future. Akins said a media content position could be handled by third-party service suppliers or agencies, adding those companies can also help fill the gaps in e-commerce merchandising and supply chain expertise. Smith agreed, adding that Wal-Mart’s Bentonville headquarters is staffed to work with every one of its 10,000 vendors, where San Bruno is not. “Conceivably, the Walmart Home Office could leverage the strength of the local vendor teams to make sure dotcom is getting its fair share of resources, items, talent and time,” he said. “Many companies we talked to plan to handle e-commerce from their Bentonville office for many years because that’s where the majority of buyers are located.” Author Bio: See latest posts Comments 57shares Talk Business & Politics by email Arkansas headlines delivered to you on demand Email address Statewide Newsletter Northeast Arkansas Newsletter Fort Smith Newsletter Northwest Arkansas Newsletter Submit Opinion Ruth Whitney Volunteering should be part of the business plan Michael Tilley Riff Raff: A Veterans Day remembrance Justin Allen Marijuana and the constitutionality of ‘Shall means shall’ Randy Zook Issue 3 will mean jobs for Arkansas Michael Tilley Riff Raff: 3 concerns with Issue 3 Special Sections Home Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Magazine Opinion © 2015 Talk Business & Politics.

Gift cards are your holiday iPhone bonus.Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET iPhone: Get a gift card Target, Walmart and Best Buy are all offering gift cards with the purchase of an iPhone 7, 7 Plus or even older iPhones on a number of carriers, but the deals vary subtly. CNET's Lynn La broke down the deals in detail. Best Buy: iPhone 7 deal. If you buy an iPhone 7 (not a 7 Plus) on an AT&T Next, Verizon Device or Sprint 24-month installment plan, Best Buy will give you a store gift card. The 256GB model comes with a $250 store gift card, but this is an in-store deal only. If you buy a 32GB or 128GB iPhone 7 (online or in-store), you'll still receive a gift card -- just not for $250. For more information, check out Best Buy's Black Friday ad. Target: iPhone 7 or 7 Plus deal. If you buy either an iPhone 7 or 7 Plus, you'll receive a $250 Target gift card. This is an in-store exclusive. iPhones need to be bought on an AT&T Next, Verizon Device or Sprint 24-month installment or lease plan. For more information, check out Target's Black Friday ad. Walmart: deal on lots of iPhones. Walmart gives you a $250 store gift card for any iPhone you buy in-store on an AT&T Next or Verizon Device installment plan. This includes the iPhone 6S, 6S Plus, 7, 7 Plus and SE. For more information, check out Walmart's Black Friday ad. The Series 1 Apple Watch has a faster processor, but you can't swim with it.Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET Apple Watch Series 1 for under $200 Target is selling the Series 1 Apple Watch, which has a faster processor but isn't fully swimproof and lacks the GPS of Series 2. At $198, it's $70 less than Apple's $269 starting price. This is a good Apple Watch model, and the best deal out there we've seen. Pencil not included.Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET 9.7-inch iPad Pro, $150 off Target is selling the 9.7-inch iPad Pro starting at $449, although it isn't clear which models will be sold. Still, for the base 32GB model, that would be $150.99 savings. Best Buy is offering a slightly less attractive deal of $125 off all 9.7-inch iPad Pros. iPad Mini 2 for $200 You can save $70 off the normal $269 price of the 32GB iPad Mini 2. Target and Walmart are both offering the Mini 2 for $200. The Mini 2 is getting long in the tooth with an older processor, but it's a serviceable mini iPad for kids and travel. iPad Air 2, save $125 If you're shopping for a larger-screened more affordable iPad, the iPad Air 2 (which also has a much better A8X processor versus the A7 on the Mini 2) will be on sale at Target starting at $274. For the 32GB base model, that's a good deal. Still a solid laptop, and it has normal ports.Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET MacBook Air for $799 The 13-inch, 128GB model of the MacBook Air is on sale for $799 at Best Buy, the lowest price we've seen yet for a MacBook. The 256GB model is $999, also not a bad deal: both save a couple hundred dollars, but remember that the Air doesn't have a Retina Display. It does, however, has phenomenal battery life (and normal USB ports).

Photographer: Shawn Baldwin/Bloomberg Wal-Mart, India supplier face suits over fake luxury sheets Blending Egyptian cotton with cheap grades said to be common Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Huddled inside Target Corp.’s headquarters in downtown Minneapolis, a team of investigators spent the summer trying to answer what should have been a simple question: What were hundreds of thousands of the retailer’s sheets actually made of? What they discovered has undermined trust in a global luxury product and set off a salvo of class-action lawsuits that have created a king-sized public relations challenge for the Indian textiles industry and the U.S. companies it supplies.  Turns out that major American retailers, including Target and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., have been selling premium-priced sheets purportedly made of Egyptian cotton -- a byword for luxury in linens -- but that may in reality be woven with lower-quality cotton blends. Three suits seeking to be certified as class-actions have been filed against supplier Welspun India Ltd. -- and a separate one last week was directed at Wal-Mart. That complaint, filed in New York by customer Dorothy Monahan, accuses the world’s largest retailer of questioning the fiber content of Welspun’s products as early as 2008, but not halting sales until after Target did so in August. Wal-Mart said it will “vigorously defend” itself. The other lawsuits, all filed in the U.S. against Welspun, allege the company fraudulently labeled its bed sheets as Egyptian cotton. Welspun declined to comment on the suits. Managing Director Rajesh Mandawewala told analysts during a conference call in August that “the error is on our side so we have to take responsibility for it.” Target, meanwhile, hasn’t been sued. “The marketing has created this image in our heads that high-quality cotton and Egypt are synonymous," said Louis Rose, a Memphis, Tennessee-based cotton industry consultant. “Consumers should be skeptical of these marketing claims. They’ll be under a lot more scrutiny now.” Target has cut ties and ended all of its $90 million in annual business with the Indian manufacturer, and Wal-Mart Stores has stopped selling Welspun sheets that had been labeled 100 percent Egyptian cotton.  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. followed suit on Monday, sending Welspun’s stock 4.5 percent lower in Mumbai the following day. The shares have tumbled about 40 percent since Aug. 19, when Target announced its decision. “The issue was about traceability, not about quality," said Welspun Group Chairman Balkrishan Goenka at a briefing in Mumbai Tuesday, adding that the company’s sales growth next fiscal year will be "muted" due to the controversy. The fake Egyptian sheet episode came to light after exhaustive work by Target investigators who analyzed sheet fibers under microscopes and tracked their journey through a global supply chain. The probe found that 750,000 of Target’s "Egyptian cotton" sheets, sold for as much as $75 a pop, didn’t contain any Egyptian cotton at all, but an amalgam of lower-quality fibers from cheaper sources.  That July discovery touched off a scandal spanning from Minnesota to Mumbai and Cairo that threatens the future of Welspun, part of a $3 billion conglomerate headed by Goenka. It may also hobble Indian textile manufacturers in the race to supply Western consumers with high-quality sheets and towels, creating an opening for competitors from China and elsewhere to grab the business, according to industry analysts. The Welspun-made sheets Target examined were sold under the Fieldcrest brand. While it has interests in steel, energy, and infrastructure, textiles are the bread and butter for Welspun, which says it supplies one in five towels sold in America and posted revenue of about $900 million in the 2016 fiscal year. Tennis stars like Roger Federer mop their brows with Welspun towels at the Wimbledon championships -- a fact the company highlights in investor presentations. The sheets fiasco reflects a simple reality: There’s a scarcity of Egyptian cotton. It first became a key export product in the early 19th century, when it arrived in France and became sought after for its silky feel. Production has been falling since the 1990s, however, and last year Egypt’s post-revolutionary military government ended subsidies for cotton farmers to shore up the state budget. A gradual decline in output has since become a precipitous plunge. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates there will be a 53 percent decrease in production this year, to an all-time low of 160,000 bales. The system for certifying Egyptian cotton is administered from Cairo by the Cotton Egypt Association, an industry group that grants stamps of approval to suppliers of 100-percent Egyptian cotton products. To receive one, CEA executive director Khaled Schuman explained, a manufacturer pays an initial fee of $5,000 and submits records of Egyptian cotton purchases and product samples, which undergo DNA analysis to identify whether the fibers were grown in Egypt or elsewhere. The companies are charged an additional $3,000 annually for the certification, according to Schuman. But once a certification is granted, producers are mostly left alone until they need to renew their label a year later. “You can’t put an employee from the association on each production line to inspect” every item being produced, said Mohamed Negm, who conducts testing of certification samples for the association to verify the fibers are Egyptian-grown. Typically, suppliers like Welspun purchase cotton in raw form from Egypt for import to Asia, where it’s turned into finished products for sale in the U.S. and elsewhere, he said. The highest-quality Egyptian material costs twice as much as the standard grade sourced from India, providing a powerful incentive to cheat. “Factories have mixed the Egyptian cotton with other low quality cottons to make profit, which has ruined the reputation of Egyptian cotton,” said Negm, adding that’s what the DNA testing and certification aim to curtail. During the set-up of the CEA’s DNA testing program, Negm said, it started analyzing random samples taken from store shelves globally; 90 percent were fake, mixed with low-quality cottons from the likes of Sudan, Burkina Faso and Pakistan. “It’s very easy to play it loose during the production process if you want,” said Liu Dang Dang, a foreign sales manager at Chinese manufacturer Jihua 3542 Textile Co. U.S. retailers “should have realized how obvious it is,” he said, adding that his company, which supplies Egyptian cotton fabric to manufacturers in the U.S. and Europe, doesn’t engage in the practice. “The price they want to pay for Egyptian cotton sheets is so low when the price of Egyptian cotton is so high.” Widespread Blending Blending is widespread in the industry and quietly tolerated by many retail chains, according to two executives at producers other than Welspun who asked not to be identified discussing the procedure. Sometimes that means mixing good-quality non-Egyptian cotton that maintains the same feel amid shortages of the real thing, but it also often includes using cheaper grades to save money, said the executives, citing their experience with cotton processing departments and export requirements for U.S. retailers. The CEA formally announced its DNA testing program in April, saying the “gold seal” it would give manufacturers who passed would help “rid the supply chain of falsely labeled goods.” Awkwardly, the first company to receive a gold seal was Welspun, for bed linens as well as towels and bath rugs. Target has decided not to rely on CEA certifications going forward, according to a person familiar with the retailer’s decisions who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. Wal-Mart, by contrast, has said it will continue to rely on the CEA standard. Schuman said the organization is “making good efforts to make the system tougher" to avoid future problems, for example by increasing the role of third-party auditors and monitoring suppliers’ inventories more closely. After discovering problems with Welspun sheets, Target quickly decided to terminate its entire relationship with the company, citing “the trust that our guests place in us." It also opted to offer refunds to customers who’d purchased them -- even if they’d been sleeping on them for years. Wal-Mart has also offered refunds. Although Welspun knew Target was investigating its products, its executives believed that, at worst, the retailer would drop only its Egyptian cotton sheets, according to a person privy to the discussions. Target didn’t warn Welspun beforehand about its Aug. 19 announcement that it was ending all its business ties, the person said, which left the company blindsided. At the time chairman Goenka’s wife Dipali, who leads Welspun’s home textile business, had just returned to India from meetings in the U.S.; she turned around immediately to do damage-control with clients, according to a person familiar with the events. In Mumbai, her husband had called an emergency meeting of department heads. He told them to ignore the company’s plunging share price and to focus on their day jobs, and that Welspun would bounce back over time, the person said. Both Goenkas declined to be interviewed. Welspun hired the audit firm EY to evaluate its practices and supply chain. On Tuesday, the company said it will move to producing all of its Egyptian cotton products in-house. Workers harvest cotton in a field in Benha, Egypt. The material first became a key export product in the early 19th century, when it arrived in France and became sought after for its silky feel. Photographer: Shawn Baldwin/Bloomberg The scandal is creating an opportunity for rival Indian supplier Trident Ltd., which has picked up a significant chunk of Welspun’s business from Wal-Mart, Target and Ikea, said a person familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Ikea often uses more than one supplier for the same product, according to a spokesperson for the Swedish company, adding that Welspun continues to supply the furniture retailer while it’s also worked with Trident for many years. Ikea said it doesn’t buy products made from Egyptian cotton due to sustainability concerns. Chinese textile producers may also benefit, analysts said. Big U.S. retailers tend to “go for Indian companies because they are cheaper," particularly thanks to lower labor costs, said Jack Yang, an executive at Chinese manufacturer Yantai Pacific Home Fashion. Scarce Cotton Anyone trying to capitalize, though, faces the same problem: a shortage of Egyptian cotton. That, in turn, might assist U.S. manufacturers of Pima cotton, another high-quality grade that promotes itself as a rival to the Egyptian variety. Back in Cairo, the guardians of the country’s sole global brand argue their efforts will be enough to rein in fakes, and they say the controversy might even have a silver lining. “If what was happening had continued, in a few years there would be zero Egyptian cotton,” Schuman said. “The turbulence now is positive. It’s raising awareness, and we are doing everything we can to protect the value of our product.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Published Nov 14th, 2016 2:50 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Retail giant Walmart U.S. will kick off its digital Black Friday sales in Arkansas at 11:01 p.m. the night before Thanksgiving Day, three hours earlier than last year. On the East Coast the official time is 12:01 a.m. Thanksgiving Day (Nov. 24) which is still well before the in-store sales begin at 6 p.m. local time that same evening. Walmart has also already made its Black Friday store circular available through the Walmart app. “I said it before and I will say it again, we will win the season on price – on Black Friday, on Cyber Monday and every day before and after,” said Steve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer, Walmart U.S. In a blog post on the retailer’s website Bratspies added, “That means delivering the Black Friday deals we’re known for in stores, online and on our app. And, we’ve secured significant availability of these items. Our goal is not to advertise a great price and then not have the product for the customer.” Walmart said it will use the wristband system for certain Black Friday and Thanksgiving Night in-store sales promotions. A common shopper complaint in years past has been there was not enough product for the demand, and even though they waited in line they were not always guaranteed the deal because supply was too short. Walmart Store Manager in Rogers, Tina Budnaitus, told Talk Business & Politics they have planned for the Thanksgiving Night and Black Friday sales since August. She said the store maps available with the Walmart app are given out ahead of time so shoppers can plan their route during the busy shopping time. She said this year the stores will use colored balloons in certain areas to signify the product category such as yellow for the toys. She said the balloons are easily seen across the store even when it’s crowded. “This year those giving out wristbands will be told not to give out wristbands that outnumber the product inventory. We are serious about this,” she said. “The stores will be completely staffed, all registers open and we have additional security personnel to ensure everyone’s safety.” She said the $99 drone and the virtual reality headsets are first-time items this year for the Walmart in-store Black Friday deals. “It will be interesting to see how those sell,” she said. A majority of the electronic and toy deals are online exclusives for the second year in row at Walmart. In hopes of selling more online Walmart said it ramped up its merchandise for online-only deals by 50% over last year. One thing Walmart did not change is that it is not offering free shipping deals outside the norm during the holiday period, despite Target’s free shipping offers. Target is also offering certain Black Friday deals on its website beginning Thanksgiving morning. Target plans to open its physical stores at 6 p.m. local time Thanksgiving Day. Competitor Best Buy will open Thanksgiving Day at 5 p.m. local time. Toys R US will also open at 5 p.m. local time on Thanksgiving Day and remain open for 30 continuous hours. “Our customers have voted at the doors year after year, and they continue to want the option to get an early start on their holiday shopping lists,” Joe Venezia, executive vice president of global store operations at Toys R Us, said in a statement. Amazon kicked off its Black Friday Deals Stores earlier this week featuring sales and updating items daily until Dec. 22. Adobe Digital Insights predicts online sales across the industry will grow 15.6% on Thanksgiving to $2 billion. Overall, Adobe predicts online sales will increase 11% this holiday season to $91.6 billion – just shy of last season’s 12.7%  growth. Kantar Research projects retail sales growth of 3.8% for the fourth quarter, a slight increase over the 3.4% growth in the year-ago period. Kantar also expects the majority of the growth this year will be driven by online sales, which it says will increase nearly 16%. Brick-and-mortar growth will be a modest 2%, the same as last year. BLACK FRIDAY IMPACT How much do Black Friday sales really matter for retailers and their bottom line? Analysts say it’s hard to know the exact impact of that one day because the buying habits of consumers have changed so much in recent years. That said, the year-end shopping season, which typically spans November and December, can account from 20% to 40% of retailer’s annual sales. The National Retail Federation expects holiday sales to grow 3.6% this year to more than $655.8 billion. NRF expects American consumers to spend an average of $935.58 this holiday shopping season, based on its annual survey of consumers conducted by Prosper Insight. Per capita spending is expected to dip 1.78% from last year’s $952.58 all-time high. The trade group said consumers cite a slight cautiousness in spending this year in part because of the election and the uncertainty of the administration change. Close to half of consumers have been tackling their holiday lists early again this year, with 41% saying they started shopping in October or earlier, according to the NRF survey. “While many holiday shoppers are starting early on their gift lists, Millennials are waiting to catch the best deals for their gifts, with nearly half (46%) waiting until November to start shopping,” said Prosper Insights Principal Analyst Pam Goodfellow. “Younger consumers are likely to be looking forward to the Thanksgiving/Black Friday shopping ‘experience’ — and know that retailers will be offering great promotions that weekend.” Charles O’Shea, senior retail analyst with Moody’s, has said retailers are in better shape this holiday season because of improved inventory control. He said shoppers out on Thanksgiving Night and Black Friday are not shopping they are buying, scouring for the best deals. He said how much retailer’s really make on the discounted deals varies widely and it’s more about taking share than padding bottom line. ADDITIONAL LABOR COSTS Not only are prices extremely discounted but store labor costs are also higher during the holiday season which also squeezes margins. “Lower prices and job growth will stimulate more holiday shopping activity this year,” said Doug Hermanson, principal economist with Kantar Retail. “On the other hand, falling prices will create a tough environment for topline retail sales growth. And while expectations of stronger than average e-commerce growth this holiday won’t surprise many, the distance at which e-commerce will lead brick-and-mortar growth will be much wider than recent years.” Retail hiring for the last three months of 2016 is expected to be about the same as last year’s 738,800 seasonal job as reported by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The global outplacement consultant firm said in retail stores the number is stagnant but higher in warehousing and transportation as e-commerce takes a bigger share of the overall spend. Amazon has announced the hiring of 120,000 temporary workers to handle holiday demand, up 20% from the 100,000 hired in 2015. Target plans to hire almost 80,000 seasonal employees, the majority of those (70,000) are for stores and about 8,000 are for warehousing and fulfillment centers related to online sales. JCPenney has said it will hire 40,000 holiday workers, about 2,000 to support online orders. Kohl’s will hire 69,000 this year which includes in-store and warehouse fulfillment. Walmart has not disclosed its holiday hiring plan this year. Last year the retail giant announced in September it would hire 60,000 for the holiday season. Macy’s will hire 83,000 for positions at Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s. Those jobs are are in stores, call centers and distribution and fulfillment. Logistics giants United Parcel Service (UPS) will hire 95,000 seasonal workers who do a majority of loading and unloading trucks. The U.S. Postal Service will hire 35,000 workers this year, up from 29,000 last year. Federal Express has not yet disclosed its holiday hiring plans.

Dennis Miller said.  The store's management had already begun evacuating the building before police arrived. The Hudson and Bergen county sheriff's departments brought K9 units into the store and deemed the threat unfounded, Miller said.  Shoppers were allowed back in the store just before 2:30 p.m.  Miller could not comment on whether the call was related to a similar threat made at a Bayonne Walmart in September. He said the department takes every threat seriously to ensure the safety of all residents and shoppers.  An employee in the parking lot Sunday afternoon described a "chaotic" scene inside the store, with people running from the building after the call was made.  No one has been arrested in connection with the threat and the investigation is ongoing. Miller thanked both sheriff departments for helping make sure there were no weapons or bombs inside the building.  Caitlin Mota may be reached at cmota@jjournal.com.

Published Nov 14th, 2016 1:37 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Margin compression and increased spending on e-commerce capabilities is expected to dampen Wal-Mart Stores’ third quarter earnings by about 7% compared to a year ago. The retail behemoth is expected to post adjusted net income of $2.972 billion ahead of the New York Stock Exchange opening bell on Thursday (Nov. 17). The estimate is lower than the $3.204 billion earned in the year-ago period. For the three months ending Sept. 30, third quarter consensus is 96 cents per share,  down from $1.03 a year ago, according to Yahoo! Finance. Revenue is expected to grow 1% to $118.61 billion, according to the consensus. Walmart U.S. is expected to report $74.667 billion in third quarter net sales, up from $72.712 billion a year ago. Comp sales are forecast by Wall Street to be 1.4% for Walmart U.S for the 13-week period, down from year ago comp sales of 1.5%. Analysts with Barclays anticipate net margin compress of about 0.40% with U.S. store comparable sales growth of 1.3% tied to decent store traffic resulting from higher consumer scores for the retailer and additional consumer spending. On the flip side, the analysts said food deflation and competition from discounters as well as Amazon will pressure earnings and comps in the near term. Wal-Mart’s own earnings guidance ranges from 90 cents to $1 per share, lowered in light of the retailer’s hefty e-commerce investments to the tune of roughly $6 billion in the span of two years, including the Jet.com acquisition and increased stake in JD.com. Analysts say the e-commerce investments are important for future growth, though they will temper shorter term profits. The Selerity Group recently noted to its clients that Wal-Mart over the past four quarters has beaten the Wall Street consensus by an average of 5 cents per share, which has helped fuel the stock price to a lofty level given the retailer’s own cautious guidance. “With the economic expansion having entered the eighth year, retail and other cyclical industries would normally be expected to struggle amid late-cycle pressures. Analysts seem obsessed with an online battle with Amazon but consumers generally look to Walmart for daily products and Amazon for less mundane items. Walmart’s online efforts would seem to be a positive with huge potential in any case,” noted Craig Bowles of Selerity Group. One of the more bullish analysts for Wal-Mart Stores is Budd Bugatch of Raymond James & Associates. Bugatch continues to rate Wal-Mart Stores as a “strong buy” despite the lower earnings Wal-Mart forecast through next year. Bugatch remains “convinced that Wal Mart’s management is focused on the correct long-term U.S. strategy: (1) fix the customer experience in the stores, (2) make e-Commerce/store shopping seamless, (3) improve the fresh/deli food presentation, and (4) thoughtfully expand the Neighborhood Market format.” “Admittedly, the lack of near-term earnings growth stretches Wal-Mart’s valuation on a multiple basis versus its historical range. Nonetheless, we are steadfast in our belief that management’s actions will continue to drive traffic and comp sales growth, and based on our intrinsic value analysis, we believe the reward in owning shares still outweighs the associated risk,” he continued. Bugatch said his team did trim their initial third quarter earnings back from 97 cents a share to the 96-cent consensus based on the near-term operating losses related to the Jet.com purchase. However, he expects the Jet purchase will help accelerate Wal-Mart sales growth by as much as 20% over the next two years beginning at the tail end of this year. Next year’s earnings growth according to Wal-Mart Stores CFO Brett Biggs will be hammered by expenses related to the Jet purchase and other e-commerce expenses as well as foreign currency pressures. The retailer slashed its earnings predictions for next year from 10% growth forecast last year down to 5% earnings growth for fiscal 2018, which begins Feb. 1, 2017. Bugatch said Wal-Mart has the potential to grow the online customer basket and essentially create the digital version of a supercenter. He said such digital growth is something the retailer must achieve to drive sales growth over the coming years. “Admittedly, the slowdown in U.S. new store growth over the next few years implies a greater contribution from comparable and e-commerce sales growth and creates some investor skepticism. Walmart has not delivered U.S comparable sales growth above 2% since late 2012. Nonetheless, we think there remains a significant opportunity for management to drive sales growth by improving the performance of the company’s  underperforming supercenters,” Bugatch added. Sam’s Club is expected to have negative comp sales including fuel and only slightly positive (0.3%) comps without the fuel impact. Sales at Sam’s Club excluding memberships are expected to top $14.122 billion, up fractionally from $14.075 billion a year ago. Like Walmart U.S., Sam’s Club’s operating margin declined slightly from a year ago. Wal-Mart’s international division is expected to see modest growth fueled by core markets of Mexico and Canada showing solid returns. Investments remain heavy in China and could take a time to pay off, and Asda in the United Kingdom is also struggling. Brazil remains in recession and Japan is moving in that direction. Shares of Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE: WMT) opened the week lower trading at $70.45 at midday on Monday (Nov. 14). Shares were down 1.08% from last week’s close. Shares have ticked up from the $67 level in mid October just prior to the retailer’s meeting with Wall Street analysts. Over the past 52-weeks the share price has ranged from $56.36 to $75.19. Year-to-date Wal-Mart shares are up 14.62%.

(Photo: Ross Chastain) 936 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Ross Chastain has been keeping his NASCAR Sprint Cup Series dreams alive. The 2011 Riverdale High School graduate, an Alva native, also has kept his hometown in his heart. Chastain, 23, planned to visit the Golisano Children’s Hospital in Fort Myers on Tuesday. On Wednesday, he scheduled two autograph and photo sessions for a pair of Wal-Mart stores in Lee County. At noon Wednesday, he planned to be at the Wal-Mart at 14821 Six Mile Cypress Parkway in Fort Myers. At 3 p.m., he planned to be at the Wal-Mart at 505 S.W. Pine Island Road in Cape Coral. But the main event arrives at 3:30 p.m. Saturday in Homestead, where Chastain will race his No. 4 Chevrolet in the NASCAR Xfinity Series Ford Ecoboost 300. “It's one step below the big boys," Chastain said, referring to the Sprint Cup Series. "I want to win Homestead. That’s the last race of the year, this Saturday. The goal is to win that thing. It’s tough.” Chastain has had a tougher time in 2016 than 2015. In 32 races this year, he has had an average starting slot of 19.8 and an average finish of 20.8. In 33 races in 2015, Chastain had an average start of 23.3 and finish of 20.3. He has finished in the lead lap nine times this year, down from 12 last year. Although his average finish had dipped, he said he continued to learn the nuances of the sport and remained hopeful of reaching the sport’s highest level someday. “Mainly, I want to keep learning,” Chastain said. “That’s the hardest part of this thing. You want to learn with every race. Just learning how to race smarter and faster. It’s one thing to run a fast lap, one lap. And it’s another thing to run 300 laps the best you can.” Chastain moved from Alva to Mooresville, North Carolina, in order to focus on his racing career. But returning home on his way to Homestead, he said, allowed him to reconnect with his local fans. The Watermelon Association, which sponsors Chastain, will be providing him samples to give away while he’s posing for pictures and signing autographs. “I just want to catch up with people from Fort Myers I haven’t seen in too long,” he said. “We’ll have the show car there for people who want to see these things up close and personal.” Then Chastain would have until Saturday to mentally prepare for the final race of the season. “It’s tough, man,” Chastain said. “We’ve been trying to get the averages up. We’re trying to do better. We’re trying as hard as we can.” Connect with this reporter: David Dorsey (Facebook), @DavidADorsey (Twitter).

(NYSE: WMT) among four discount retailers within its coverage universe to receive a boost in expectations. As far as Dollar General Corp. (NYSE: DG), Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) and Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR) are concerned, the firm has either slashed or maintained its expectations on same-store sales. Wal-Mart Analyst Daniel Binder boosted his Wal-Mart's SSS expectations from 1.5 percent to 1.7 percent in the United States for the third quarter. The analyst checks indicated continued sales momentum fueled by several other factors like price investments, store execution and continued e-commerce enhancements. This would boost gross margin and in relation EPS estimate from $0.94 to $0.96, which is within the forecast of $0.90–$1.00 offered by the retailer. He is not surprised by price cuts in electronics in the recent months. Target The brokerage thinks Target has established a low bar of SSS of zero to -2 percent apart from a $0.75–$0.95-wide EPS range guidance. The firm thinks the retailer could achieve zero to -1 percent SSS and maintained its EPS projection of $0.87, pointing out weaker sales trends and enough space to respond to Wal-Mart. Dollar Tree The analyst expects Dollar Tree to achieve SSS growth of 1 – 1.5 percent based on its checks. He maintained its SSS expectations of 1 percent and EPS projections of $0.72 and pointed out risk factors coming from expense inflation, price investment activity by rivals and systems and supply chain integration. Dollar General The brokerage slashed its sales and EPS estimates modestly based on field checks. While reducing SSS expectations from 1 percent to 0.5 percent, the firm reduced its EPS estimate from $0.97 to $0.93. “We also saw DG doing some of its own price investment activity through absolute price cuts and percentage off promotions with a minimum spend (often 20 percent off). As we spoke to store managers about price competition the intensity increased in October and Walmart was primarily named as the source of this activity, but Family Dollar was mentioned as well,” the brokerage said in a note.

Target and Wal-Mart are offering it, but the question is whether consumers will respond. Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Nov 14, 2016 at 9:41AM Over the 2016 holiday season, both Target (NYSE:TGT) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) have doubled down on the idea that people will place orders online and pick them up in store. Both are trying to improve the process with dedicated staff, but the question is how big demand will be aside from the holidays. In this clip from Industry Focus: Consumer Goods, host Vincent Shen is joined by Motley Fool contributing writer Daniel Kline to dig into some of the facts behind this growing customer-service method. The two look at the opportunity and debate whether the idea has any merit outside of the holiday season. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Nov. 8, 2016. Vince Shen: A somewhat related topic around in-store pickup, and how some of the more traditional big-box retailers are leveraging this, I want to touch on this, again, related to the growing popularity of this delivery method for customers. About 20% of Americans, in a PwC survey, say they use in-store pickup on a regular basis, which really surprised me. About half of the survey respondents use in-store pickup occasionally. So some of these traditional big-box retailers -- think Wal-Mart, think Target-- they have to deal with a lot of the challenges of integrating ship-to-store, in-store pickup capabilities into their established retail layouts. So, thinking of, how you optimize your staffing, how you store your inventory, how you separate your work spaces. But I would argue that [Amazon.com] has an advantage here, in that they're building their stores around this concept. Dan Kline: They are. The chief person for this is either the person who feels their product is going to get stolen if it's delivered to their door, or, in the case of where I've used pick-up in-store at Target, when my wife wanted to pick up the sheets at our vacation condo, but have me pick them up. So she ordered them in Connecticut; I picked them up in Florida, same day. Now, what Target's doing to facilitate this is, they're going to have dedicated personnel, at least for the holiday season, devoted to doing this, because the problem with pickup in-store has been, it's a bit like when you go to Panera Bread and they have the Order Ahead, yet no two stores do it the same way, and you never know where your bagel is. So you walk into Target, and basically, you were a pioneer doing something that the person behind the counter didn't necessarily know the procedure for. Maybe it was in the layaway area, maybe it was in the set-aside area, maybe they had to go pick it off the store shelves. So absolutely, they have stepped up how they do this, but I do think it's something that -- the holiday season, it makes a lot of sense. You need things faster; you want gifts when you want them. If it's the hot TV, you want to make sure you have already ordered it so you don't go to the store and have it be out. But is there really a huge demand for this in August? Shen: OK. So, you mentioned some of the potential top- and bottom-line impact. Jeremy Bowman, one of our Fool.com contributors, he has a really interesting piece on some of these developments that we've discussed at Amazon. He dug a little deeper into the numbers to estimate what the potential financial impact a 2,000-store network could have for the company. He uses some comparable metrics and numbers from leading grocery chain Kroger. The idea is, 2,000 locations, assuming about 30,000 square feet of retail space, and what Kroger can generate per square foot, currently, in sales -- it's about $40 billion of grocery revenue. So I think, in the last 12 months, Amazon has had about $120 billion in revenue. So that's significant. Granted, this would be over many, many years in order to get to that. Kline: And what's the margin on that? Shen: Exactly. That's, I think, the point that Jeremy really hits -- significant addition to the top line, but in terms of those razor-thin margins, think 2%-3% for the grocery industry overall. That's adding less than $1 billion to the bottom line while using those benchmark figures. So, you see, it is not going to be this huge profit driver for the company. But even if it doesn't scale to that thousands of locations, it's just part of [Jeff] Bezos' strategy to get Amazon to be a bigger and bigger part of your life. Kline: The question comes down to, how can they leverage their user base? I'm a Prime member; so are about 25% of all Americans. If they can message to me and get me into that store, where perhaps I'm going to pick up my groceries, maybe I'm going to get a new Kindle, and maybe they can sign me up for an AWS account, all at the same time, while providing the ability to return without putting it in a box. If they can leverage all of those things, I see convenience. But that's not cheap. One of the reasons Amazon is cheaper is, they don't have the customer-service expense of a physical store, because it's all automated. If you want to do a return, you click "return" and it sends you a shipping label, and you send it back, and a robot puts it away. So I can see how it would work, but it does seem like a lot of effort for nothing. I would rather see 2,000 bookstores. Daniel Kline has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Two of the biggest online retailers, Walmart and Amazon, are ready to go head-to-head this holiday shopping season by slashing prices and once again offering “price match guarantees” on many of their popular items. Amazon's Countdown To Black Friday is here! — https://t.co/uQqodfm4vZ #BlackFriday #AmazonEcho pic.twitter.com/fT6EArycSX — iHoliday (@Halloweengal801) November 14, 2016 Every year major retailers like Walmart, Amazon, Target and Best Buy always try to outdo each other on Black Friday, but sometimes shopping the Black Friday pre-sales online can save consumers big bucks too. When it comes to price matching, stores are much more lenient than they were 20 years ago because they know the competition is fierce. However, there are some details to keep in mind when it comes to comparison shopping. Gottabemobile reports Walmart will price match to local competitors as well as to select online competitors, including Amazon, but if you are a real bargain shopper you need to keep this in mind. They may not match “limited offers” or items that they won’t be restocking for several weeks due to high demand. Walmart’s policy does state “Walmart.com will not Price Match from Thanksgiving Day through the Monday after Thanksgiving.” Now while that may sound bad, it really isn’t. Walmart is already running great deals from now until the Wednesday before Thanksgiving that they will price match, and some of them are just as good as they will be on Black Friday. Walmart Black Friday 2016 deals have hit the internet. [Image by Joe Raedle/Getty Images] Already items such as a Hitachi 65″ 4K Ultra HDTV is marked down to $599, which is $400 off the regular price. And of course if you find it at a cheaper price somewhere else they will price match. They also have hundreds of other great deals leading up to Black Friday on the hottest video games, Xbox One bundles and children’s toys. Other great TV deals Walmart will have for Black Friday shoppers include a Samsung 50-inch 4K Smart TV for $398, a Samsung 60-inch 4K Smart TV for $648, and a Philips 55-inch 4K LED Smart TV for $298. The real deal of the day will be a Hisense 40-inch 1080p HDTV for the incredible price of $125. As for Amazon, they are already in Black Friday mode as well. The online retail giant is already running their annual “Countdown to Black Friday” with sale prices on everything, literally. The only trick is that you need to continue to look into what is on sale each day. Every day from now until November 24, Amazon will be offering multiple “Lightning Deals” and one hour sales throughout the day on various in-demand items like laptops, beauty products, HDTV’s, Kindles and more. If you are an Amazon Prime member, you will get early access to over 30,000 deals for Black Friday and Cyber Monday online shopping specials, which include laptops up to 35-45 percent off the regular price and discounted prices on their hot-selling Amazon Echo. One item that is always popular during the holidays is video game consoles, and this year will be no exception. The Xbox One and Play Station 4 will be on the wish list for many this season. Right now, if you are an Amazon Prime member you can pick up various game consoles of the Xbox One 500 GB for $242. Amazon Black Friday 2016 has workers on alert already. [Image by Jeff Spicer/Getty Images] The Echo has received excellent reviews from many media outlets and is one of the most sought after gifts of the season. The Amazon Echo is a voice interaction device that can do it all! From playing music of your choice on demand, making to-do lists, setting alarms, streaming podcasts, playing audiobooks, and providing weather, traffic and other real time information, this all in one device named “Alexa” is a great assistant to have around. It would make the perfect gift for anyone – including yourself. Of course, let’s not forget the biggest advantage of buying from Amazon, Walmart and other online outlets, you can do it all from the convenience of your own home.

She was hired in August 2009 and, three-and-a-half years later, promoted to pharmaceutical department manager at a different store and given a raise to $10.05 an hour. She was 53 and married with four grown kids, one of whom also worked for Walmart, when she started the new position on a Monday in January 2013. Four days later, doctors discovered a mass on her lung. During the next year, Marler went to dozens of doctors’ appointments and underwent three surgeries. She had to figure out which leave policies applied, a sometimes complicated process for Walmart workers. The retailer, the largest private employer in the country, with more than 1 million workers, has more than 250 pages of human resources policies. When Marler was sick, those policies were available only on Walmart’s intranet, called the Wire, and accessible only on company computers—only when employees were at work and on the clock, she says. According to a company spokesman, since early 2016 employees have been able to access information about the company’s paid time off and leave policies from any device. But when Marler was navigating her cancer, she says, she had to use the computer in the personnel manager’s office with the manager present. “Walmart tells you that your activity will be tracked,” she says. “Even if they don’t use it, there’s the sense that they’re always watching.” In the months after her diagnosis, she didn’t have time to check how best to handle all her doctors’ appointments, so she usually took a half day off for each one. Walmart says employees can also call a benefits hotline or talk to a manager about personnel matters. Marler didn’t, and her absences led to a disciplinary meeting with her store manager, where she learned she could have applied for intermittent leave for the two-hour appointments and escaped reprimand. She ultimately took four leaves of absence to deal with her medical problems. In June 2014, she was reassigned to a stockroom job, earning $11.05 an hour for the physically demanding work. Now, Marler has a second job: She’s one of about two dozen current and former employees who helped construct an app called WorkIt that answers questions about Walmart’s policies and workplace rights using Watson, IBM’s artificial intelligence bot. So-called peer experts such as Marler feed information into a database and are on call to answer questions when Watson can’t. OUR Walmart, the employee and labor activist group that’s been pushing for better wages and working conditions, is behind the effort and will roll out the free app on Nov. 14. For the past four years, the group has organized protests and walkouts around Black Friday, one of the busiest shopping days of the year, to draw more attention to the problems of low-wage workers. This year it will promote WorkIt instead. It’s a strangely promising time for labor organizers. Unions are in decline; OUR Walmart’s membership seems to have peaked at about 5,000, in part because of the company’s opposition to the group. But OUR Walmart says it has a network of some 100,000 employees who’ve participated in 1 million conversations on Facebook about workplace issues since 2012. The group claims credit for Walmart’s decision last year to raise hourly wages, offer more predictable schedules and hours, and begin to reconsider some of its leave policies. Walmart says the changes were business decisions that had nothing to do with the group. But the predicament of low-wage workers, and a tightening labor market, have become national concerns. Although the federal government hasn’t adjusted the minimum wage since 2009, states and cities around the country have, along with big companies such as Costco, Gap, Starbucks, and Target. Online organizing has made it easier to stage protests, collect contributions and signatures, and share information. But social media is mostly public and often chaotic, and the information it carries isn’t always always trustworthy. WorkIt is organized, efficient, and secure, OUR Walmart says. As with any technology, it’s supposed to help the group scale and gather data. OUR Walmart wants specific, up-to-date information about what it sees as the problems Walmart employees are experiencing. “It will give us real evidence to talk to the company about what’s broken,” says Andrea Dehlendorf, co-director of OUR Walmart. “We have to be in a place where we can say, ‘This is the truth. We have massive data.’ ” OUR Walmart isn’t trying to unionize Walmart per se. The group split from the UFCW last year ago. Zack Exley, who helped lead Bernie Sanders’ grass-roots campaign, is familiar with the group and the app. “Instead of asking, would you like a union? They’re actually just going ahead and building it,” he says. “A lot of us who are concerned with workers organizing have been dreaming of an app like this.” In 2015, Dehlendorf and OUR Walmart co-director Dan Schlademan asked employees what service they most wanted. Many said they needed information and advice about policies and rights in the workplace—OUR Walmart already was getting as many as 50 inquiries a day on its Facebook page. They raised a combined $200,000 from groups including the Workers Lab, which focuses on ventures that build economic power for workers, New Media Ventures, an angel investing firm, and the Open Society to license Watson and create an app. Dehlendorf and Schlademan hired a technologist, Cat Huang, who had worked at the Citizen Engagement Lab, and a developer, Jason Van Anden, who built the ACLU’s Mobile Justice app, which allows users to record encounters with police and instantly send video to the organization. During her health troubles, Marler had joined a Walmart employee Facebook group, mostly to whine and vent, she says. She began learning more about Walmart’s leave policies and eventually found herself answering questions posed to the group by other employees. This summer two leaders of OUR Walmart reached out to Marler and invited her to a hackathon in Los Angeles in August. On the first day, a group of 18 current and former employees identified 50 main issues and wrote questions workers might ask. They spent the next day answering them, relying on policy manuals that OUR Walmart had pieced together over the years, their own experience, and some expert advice. By the end they’d trained Watson to answer 93 questions. WorkIt users can sign in anonymously if they’re concerned about privacy and retaliation. Those who register can participate in chat groups; only their user names and store positions are visible to others in the chat. Mindful of Walmart policies on the use of company documents, Huang made sure there are no links to actual Walmart documents. “We store interpretations of the policies,” she says. Now in beta and available only on the Android operating system, WorkIt can answer 200 questions using Watson’s artificial intelligence. If Watson can’t answer a question with 100 percent confidence, it will kick it over to volunteer peer experts. Watson learns from the experts’ answers. The app also provides links to federal and state laws covering worker protections, as well as local child-care resources and food banks.  After users receive an answer, they’re asked if they would like to be connected to other workers with the same concerns. “If people don’t want to be on the front lines, they can get involved this way. It’s about meeting people where they’re comfortable,” says Tyfani Faulkner, a former Walmart employee and OUR Walmart leader. Walmart’s labor-relations team is aware of the app and has sent a warning memo about it that managers are required to read to their staffs, OUR Walmart says. “We just wanted to give you a heads up that if someone tries to get you to download an OUR Walmart work-related app on your mobile device, you may unknowingly be giving away valuable personal information like your location and personal contact information that the union can use however it wants,” reads part of the statement. In an e-mail, Walmart spokesman Kory Lundberg said, “Our associates already have anytime-access online to the company’s most current and accurate Paid Time Off and Leave policies and there is no way to know if the details this group is pushing are correct. Our people are smart and see this for what it is, an attempt by an outside group to collect as much personal and private information as possible.” For the record, WorkIt doesn’t track people’s location or ask users to grant access to location services, Huang says. And, Dehlendorf says, “We’re not going to sell the data, ever. We will share it with researchers and use it to inform conversations with Walmart. But it’s not part of the revenue model.” OUR Walmart, a nonprofit since its split with the UFCW, has a revenue model. Funding from foundations and investors isn’t always predictable, and membership fees of $5 a month are insufficient. The group hopes to license WorkIt to other organizations—it says a labor group in Australia is interested—and even to companies. “A higher-road employer would license it,” says Carmen Rojas, a co-founder of the Workers Lab, which gave OUR Walmart $20,000 early on. “If I were the CEO of Costco, I would.” Eventually, Dehlendorf says, the group could make deals to provide users with low-cost financial services or child care, which would allow it to earn a small fee per user. Shayna Strom, a researcher at the Century Foundation, says a substantial portion of the AFL-CIO’s revenue comes from the union’s branded credit card. MoveOn.org is trying to raise money by negotiating discounts with clean energy companies and marketing those lower-priced services to members. For now, OUR Walmart is expecting 14,000 employees to download the app by the end of 2017. That’s about 1 percent of all Walmart workers. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

(Harry Scull Jr./Buffalo News) By Aaron Garland Published Sat, Nov 12, 2016 Updated Sun, Nov 13, 2016 SHARE TWEET EMAIL During the Dunkirk football team’s uplifting, exhilarating postseason run, Mike Sarratori has found it hard to run errands without hearing positive comments about his Marauders. “Everybody is excited at home,” the Dunkirk coach said. “You can’t go to Walmart, you can’t go to the drug store without someone saying something. There are people stopping at my practices, stopping at my office. People calling, emailing, and that’s people from years and years ago — before my time.” At least for another week, Sarratori is going to find it tough to make an in-and-out Walmart trip. The Marauders outlasted Batavia, 50-48, to win an overtime thriller in the New York State Public High School Athletic Association Class B Far West Regionals Saturday night at New Era Field and punch their ticket to the state final four. The evenly matched heavyweight clash featured two red-hot teams as the Marauders (9-2) won their ninth consecutive game while Batavia, the fifth-ranked Class B school in the state, dropped its first game and finished 10-1. It was the Blue Devils’ third consecutive loss in Far West Regionals. Dunkirk’s gutsy win continued its dream, unprecedented season. A week after claiming their first-ever Section VI title, the Marauders won in their initial regionals appearance. “It seems unreal right now,” lineman Jamall Gaines said. “This is the first time in Dunkirk history, and we did this.” As if Sarratori’s Walmart testimony wasn't enough, proof that Dunkirk’s magical ride is capturing the town sits — and is heard — in the stands. Dunkirk supporters have packed sections of New Era Field the last two weeks to watch the Marauders make history. “I can’t enjoy it right now but this is special," said Sarratori, who has remained mostly stoic the last few weeks in hopes of a larger feat. "This team is bringing this community together." Alton Ingram ran 16 yards for a score and plunged across the end zone for the two-point conversion to give the Marauders an eight-point lead in overtime. The Blue Devils answered with a touchdown on their OT possession, but Jerry Reinhart's conversion pass fell incomplete to end it. Ingram was a workhorse for the Marauders, and he had to be. Talented runner Juan Damas missed the game with an injury and fellow backs Tywon Wright and Isiah Velez got hurt during the contest and missed much of it. Ingram responded by running for 240 yards and four touchdowns on 33 carries. “In the second half I told him, ‘Everyone is hurt, buddy. It has to be on your shoulders,’” Sarratori said. “He’s just a tough kid. He accepts a challenge and he amazes me every week.” “What I say is, ‘Get it together and keep pushing — we’ll get through this together,’” Ingram said. Dunkirk is known for its efficient and explosive running game. But on this night, the Marauders complemented that beautifully with clutch throws. Quarterback Evon Hernandez was 5 of 7 for 119 yards and two touchdowns and ran for 59 yards and another score. His night was highlighted by a 5-yard scoring throw to Dontrell Clemons on a fourth-down rollout with 2:33 left to break a 34-34 tie. The Blue Devils, who were led by Ray Leach's four total TDs and 224 rushing yards, tied it up with 16 seconds left to force overtime. Still, Dunkirk’s passing was a key to another win — the biggest one in school history to date. “Since Day One we’ve been confident in our passing game, it’s just not our philosophy,” Sarratori said. “If you want to make us do it, we can do it." The Marauders, the seventh-ranked Class B team in the state, will play Section IV’s Chenango Forks in the state semifinals at 3 p.m. Saturday at Cicero-North Syracuse High School.

Shopping 1 0 0 November 13, 2016 Meijer Black Friday 2016 Ad: Will Tech Sales Deals Rival Best Buy, Target, And Walmart? Matt Couden The Meijer Black Friday 2016 ad has leaked online recently, just in time for comparisons with some of their bigger competitors in the electronics retail space. With Best Buy, Walmart, Target, and Amazon all fighting for Black Friday shoppers, Meijer is a national chain that tends to get overlooked. However, they are still offering some enticing deals in their leaked sales advertisement that could draw customers into their stores around the United States. It was reported on Friday by BGR that this year’s Meijer ad features a variety of deals for their holiday sale that span from Thanksgiving through Saturday of the Black Friday shopping season. Among those deals on Thursday will be a Vizio 50-inch LED TV for just $199.99, an Element 55-inch Smart 4K UHD TV for $279.99, a Fitbit Charge 2 for $129.99, and Beats Solo 2 headphones for just $99.97. On Friday, the retailer will offer different deals including a Vizio 60-inch Smart 4K UHD TV for $599.99, a Nintendo 3DS Super Mario Edition portable game console for $99.99, and the Sphero BB8 Star Wars Droid for $99.99. Black Friday deals on HDTVs are still popular in 2016. [Image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images] Meijer will also be offering a reduced price on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 video game consoles that seem popular this holiday season. They’ll have the PlayStation 4 500 GB Uncharted Console Bundle, the Xbox One S Console or Xbox One Console Bundle for $249.99 each. Of note, a recent deal shown inside the GameStop Black Friday ad offers the PS4 bundle along with the customer’s choice of a second game for the same price. The Meijer stores are only located in certain regions of the country. Just a few states in the country that have Meijer store locations include Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana. Their 2016 Black Friday sale is advertised to start on Thursday as of 6 a.m. in stores with different deals on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. The full sales advertisement for their three days of deals can be seen at the Meijer.com website. As of this report, Black Friday 2016 sales ads have leaked from many of the biggest retailers around including Best Buy, Target, and Walmart. Each of these retailers is trying their best to lure customers with their sales deals. For example, Walmart’s Black Friday sale has a $298 Phillips 55-inch 4K Ultra HD TV, a Roku Express for just $25, select DVDs for under $10, and a Straight Talk Apple iPhone 5S prepaid smartphone for just $99. Target also has some great deals listed in their recent ad including a $249.99 Hisense 50-inch Ultra HD TV, Powerbeats wireless earphones for $89.99, Fitbit Charge HR for $89.95, and the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus with a free $250 Target gift card. Target will also be giving shoppers a special Black Friday presale on Wednesday, November 23 where they can take advantage of grabbing some of the deals online, while supplies last. Customers shop Black Friday sales deals at Best Buy store. [Image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images] Best Buy is another electronics retailer that many shoppers love to buy from around this time of year. Among their best Black Friday deals will be a Toshiba 49-inch Class LED 4K Ultra HD TV with Chromecast built-in for just $199.99. There’s also a 55-inch Samsung Class 4K Ultra HD TV for $479.99, a Dell Inspiron 15.6-inch Touchscreen laptop for $349.99, and the Amazon Fire 7-inch tablet for just $33.33. For those who may want to be extra savvy with savings this holiday season, an article from WPTV presents some potential good advice. They mention that last year’s Cyber Monday deals actually topped those on Black Friday showing that patience may be rewarded. The report also suggests that customers have more online information at their fingertips than ever before in the form of leaked ads, email notifications, websites, and, of course, mobile apps to help track any new deals or sales details. Will you be shopping at a Meijer store for any deals this Black Friday, or going with one of the other retailers for your shopping needs?

MUMBAI: The Indian unit of the world's largest retailer, Walmart Stores, posted a 7% rise in revenue and narrowed losses in consumer goods market that saw decade low sales growth. Walmart India posted sales of Rs 3,996.8 crore for fifteen months ended March 2016 compared to Rs 2,991 crore during twelve months ended December 2014. While sales grew 34%, the company grew 7% on annualised basis. Losses declined from Rs 232.2 crore to Rs 140.4 crore in the same period. The company opened one store after a gap of more than two years to take its store count to 21. The new store opened in Agra was also its first after becoming a fully-owned subsidiary of Walmart Stores Inc. "We are excited with this continuous progress and our contribution to the Indian economy through job creation, supporting 'Make in India' through local sourcing, supporting women entrepreneurs, small and medium enterprises, start-up entrepreneurs and farmers," said Krish Iyer, CEO of Walmart India, where more than 95% of goods sold are locally sourced. "Through our growing footprint in the country, we will continue to grow our business profitably while contributing to the growth & prosperity of the nation." About three years ago, Walmart agreed to buy Bharti's 50% in their wholesale business that operated Best Price Modern Wholesale stores and terminated franchise and supply agreements related to almost 200 EasyDay retail stores. With the joint venture getting dissolved, Walmart now sells goods only to traders, institutions and kiranas. The termination of supply agreement with EasyDay stores affected overall sales a year ago, when its revenue dipped 32%. Most wholesale operators are bullish on expansion - rival Metro AG, which had not been able to capitalise on its first-mover advantage, wants to double wholesale stores in the country to 50 by 2020. While latest performance isn't available, Metro Cash & Carry India incurred a loss of Rs 142 crore on a turnover of Rs 3,439.9 crore for 2013-14. Walmart too announced it would add 50 stores in the next 4-5 years in India after store expansion was put on hold until August 2015 amid an ongoing internal probe to check if its local unit had violated the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. While organised wholesalers that sell merchandise to local kirana stores, hotels and catering firms operate in 12 states; Punjab, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra contribute half the sales. Soft drinks (12%) dominate the channel in terms of value within the CPG space, followed by toilet soaps (9%) and washing powder (8%), according to a Nielsen report last year. With at least four players, Walmart, Metro, Bookers and Reliance —operating 92 cash and carry stores, nearly 2.6% of traditional trade in all consumer product goods (CPG) moves through organised wholesale. The Rs 6,800 crore market has been growing at 13%, faster than modern trade, albeit on a lower base. In 2015-16, sales growth of consumer goods slowed the most in about a decade, suggesting that Indians cut spending — especially on discretionary products — due to high inflation and a sluggish economy.

Smucker stocks are all set for big moves over the next few trading days. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Nov 13, 2016 at 12:00PM Stocks rose by a wide margin last week, despite a surprising result in the U.S. presidential election that originally sent markets plunging. By the end of the week the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) had gained over 5% to reach a new record high. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) added 4% to bring its year-to-date gain to 6%. ^DJI data by YCharts. In the week ahead, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), and J.M. Smucker (NYSE:SJM) shareholders are likely to see big moves in their investments tied to fresh earnings reports. Wal-Mart's customer traffic Wal-Mart posts its earnings results before the market opens on Thursday morning. The world's biggest retailer is outperforming the market so far this year on evidence that its sales growth rebound is gaining steam. At its last quarterly check-in, Wal-Mart beat management's forecast for comparable-store sales gains as it enjoyed its seventh consecutive quarter of increasing customer traffic. That improvement, plus decent results on the e-commerce side, helped sales tick slightly higher despite an almost 3-percentage-point headwind from currency changes. Image source: Wal-Mart. Consensus estimates call for similarly weak growth this quarter, with revenue rising 1% to $119 billion. Profits should decline to $0.96 per share from $0.99 per share a year ago as the company continues to invest in improving the shopping experience through initiatives like higher employee wages and cleaner store designs. Management will be happy to take that minor profit decline so long as it produces higher shopper satisfaction heading into the all-important holiday shopping season. Cisco's profit margin Networking giant Cisco will announce earnings numbers after the market closes on Wednesday. And, with the stock up 15% so far this year, expectations are high heading into the report. Investors have good reasons to be bullish -- especially on profits. While sales haven't budged over the last 12 months, Cisco produced 21% higher earnings over that time as cost cuts flowed directly down to the bottom line. Image source: Getty Images. The company's diverse portfolio also showed its strength recently, as declines in the service provider video and NGN routing areas were completely offset by gains in other places like switching and collaboration. CEO Chuck Robbins and his team forecast that sales will tick up by 1% this quarter as non-GAAP gross margin weighs in at about 64%, or just ahead of last quarter's 63% mark. Investors can expect management to highlight the fastest-growing areas of its networking business on Wednesday in addition to its hefty cash generation. Cisco delivered nearly $9 billion to shareholders in the last fiscal year, mostly through dividends, and that figure should rise by a healthy margin in fiscal 2017 -- assuming Cisco can navigate its biggest growth challenges. Smucker's pet food sales J.M. Smucker, the company behind consumer food brands such as Jif peanut butter and Crisco vegetable oil, hopes to get back to its winning ways with results this week. The stock has pulled far back from the record high it reached just before its late-August earnings report revealed worrying growth trends. Smucker's big push into the pet food market has been a challenge so far, for example, as the segment suffered lower volume. Its coffee business also slowed down from its awesome growth pace thanks to falling costs that track the declines in coffee bean prices. As a result of those and other challenges, executives lowered their full-year sales growth target and now see revenue declining slightly for the 2017 fiscal year rather than holding steady. Investors will likely get an update on that projection this week. They'll also find out whether Smucker's still believes it will produce $1 billion of free cash flow and as much as $7.75 per share of adjusted earnings in fiscal 2017.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Black Friday Not Dying Because Of 4K TV Deals Posted: Nov 13 2016, 4:41am CST | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Nov 13 2016, 8:13am CST, in News | Black Friday   This story may contain affiliate links. Photo Credit: Getty Images   The Black Friday sales event is aging, but it doesn't get old and it is far from dead. When the first signs of the Holiday season appear, reports appear that say that Black Friday is dead. It is an annual tradition to trash Black Friday before it is showing its face. The argument is that consumers can get deals all year round because of online shopping. This is just not true as demonstrated impressively this year by the Black Friday deals on 4K TVs. Don't Miss: Best Walmart Black Friday 2016 Deals Black Friday 2016 advertise 4K TV deals including a  $199.99 for a 49-inch 4K Smart TV, $249.99 for a 50-inch 4K Smart TV and $298 for a 55-inch 4K Smart TV. Last year the lowest priced 4K TV in Black Friday ads was a $399.99 55-inch Element 4K Smart TV. All bargain doorbuster TV deals below $300 have been on 1080p TVs. When this year was a 49-inch Toshiba 4K Ultra HD Smart TV on sale for under $200? Right. never. This Best Buy Black Friday doorbuster deal will be very hard to get, as well as the other two mentioned 4K TV doorbuster deals announced by Target and Walmart. These three standout Black Friday 2016 deals are though by far not the only Black Friday 4K TV deals. The deals are across the whole range of 4K TVs beginning with bargain 4K TVs, mid-range 4K TVs, HDR 4K TV and high-end OLED 4K TVs. Find deals in the list of 4K TVs advertised by Target, Walmart and Best Buy for Black Friday. There are already many HDR 4K TVs on sale now in early Black Friday sales. On Saturday, the Sam's Club 1-Day Black Friday sale sold out the advertised 4K TV deals before noon. The demand for 4K TVs is already high 10 days before Thanksgiving, when most Black Friday sales begin. The Consumer Technology Association estimates that consumers will buy 4.5 million 4K TVs during the Holiday season. Black Friday offers again big deals, but not all are easy to get and deal hunters need to put the work in. The Sam's Club sale yesterday was easy to shop, as long as shoppers either stayed up late or got up early in the morning. On Thanksgiving Day, sleeping in is not an option to score the best Black Friday deals that will be on sale online. To get the in-store only Black Friday 2016 doorbuster, deal hunters need to invest hours lining up at stores before the doors open for the Black Friday sale. Ideally they are organized in family and friends teams to be able to score all the deals they want. Deal hunting on Black Friday was never easy, but it pays off.  In past years, Walmart made it easy to purchase select doorbuster deals with the 1-Hour Guarantee promotion. This year Walmart is not offering this short cut to doorbuster deals. Walmart shoppers need to line-up early enough to score a wristband for the doorbuster deal of their choice. Best Buy has the same wristband system for its doorbuster deals including the $199.99 4K TV doorbuster. The best chance to score doorbuster deals online that are advertised as in-store only is on Amazon. The giant online retailer has in the past matched the most popular doorbuster deals of Best Buy, Target and Walmart with similar online deals. We track all Amazon Black Friday 2016 deals that match deals advertised in Black Friday ads in our Black Friday 2016 Hub. Keep following our coverage of Black Friday 2016 to not miss a deal.

Tucked in the back of the store, the desk was often hidden by a huge line of shoppers with carts full of stuff – especially around the holidays. For a long time, layaway was seen as a smart way to save up the money for Christmas gifts. If you didn’t have the cash to shop early, layaway let you select items when you were ready then pay for your gifts over several weeks or months. Most stores asked you to put a deposit down equivalent to a certain percentage of your basket, say 10%. That way, you had some “skin in the game” and were less likely to leave your layaway to rot. Once your layaway was stashed away in the back of the store, you would stop in to make monthly payments whenever you could. Eventually, you would pay down your bill and take your items home. And boy, those were the days. Of course, layaway still exists; it’s just a lot less prevalent and not always offered year-round. At Walmart, for example, layaway season starts in September and ends in mid-December. Other stores like Marshalls, Burlington Coat Factory, Toys ‘R Us, and Kmart still offer some type of layaway plan for customers at least part of the year. Why We Choose Credit Card Debt Over Layaway Still, it’s not nearly as common to hear of a family member or friend who uses layaway in 2016. Nope, today’s shoppers are more likely to charge their purchases to a credit card and worry about how they’ll pay later. Why the seismic shift in how we shop? In my opinion, it’s all about instant gratification. Where layaway forced you to save up for what you wanted and make payments all along, credit cards allow the opposite. With a credit card, you can have what you want now, and then worry about how you’ll pay. You don’t have to wait, nor do you have to save up a dime. You just walk in the store and take what you want, then pass the buck to the “future you.” Unfortunately, the “buy now, pay later” mentality has become the American way. A recent analysis from Value Penguin shows average credit card debt for households who carry a balance rang in at $16,048 while average consumer debt across all households was $5,700. Meanwhile, households with the lowest net worth (zero or negative) reported an average of $10,308 in credit card debt. These huge debts we carry aren’t the exception; they have become the norm. In 2016, it’s perfectly normal to finance everything you buy – and not just your home. These days, you’re almost expected to finance your car, your clothing, and even your smartphone. Unfortunately, we pay for the privilege of borrowing dearly – and not only in interest payments, but in the stress debt adds to our lives. Why I Miss Layaway Is layaway a complicated way to pay for your holiday gifts? Yes. But was it a smart way? I certainly think so. For starters, layaway forces you to understand exactly how much you’re spending on the holidays. And since layaway orders had to be paid off before you could take your stuff home, you were forced to spend within your means. Second, layaway didn’t let you enjoy your purchases right away. Instead, you had to endure the arduous task of paying your entire bill off first. In that respect, it forced you to delay gratification and the joy that comes with buying something new. Lastly, using layaway forced you to plan. To successfully use layaway to fund Christmas, you had to shop for your holiday purchases months ahead and make sure you could afford to pay your gifts off before the holidays hit. This represents a huge difference from the way people shop for the holidays now. I mean, why save money ahead of time when you can shop last minute and charge everything to your credit card, whether you can actually pay for it or not? Related: How Much Could You Save for the Holidays if You Started Saving Now? How to Create a Last-Minute Layaway Plan I didn’t use layaway this year, and I’m not entirely sure any of the stores in my area offer it anyway. Still, I cobbled together my own holiday layaway plan in the form of a targeted savings account I opened this past summer. And ever since then, I’ve stashed away a few hundred bucks per month to reach the $800 I wanted to save before December 1st hit. While it’s definitely nearing crunch time for holiday shopping and saving, here’s how you can do the same: Figure out how much you should spend on the holidays. The National Retail Federation reports that the average consumer will spend more than $900 on holiday gifts this year. Hopefully, you can spend a lot less. To figure out where you stand, create a list of people you need to buy for and assign each a dollar amount. Tally up your list to figure out a grand total for your holiday shopping list. Look for ways to save. If your list is bigger than you can reasonably afford, finding ways to save is your best move. Determine whether you can opt out of any specific gift exchanges and ask family members if you can skip gifts this year. Also consider making some homemade gifts instead of buying everything at the store. Start setting money aside every week. Even though you don’t have a lot of time, you can still save up a reasonable amount before the holidays if you start right now. Start saving as much as you can weekly or on paydays. Plan to shop right before the holidays – or shop as you find the best deals. As you get your last-minute layaway plan underway, you can decide how to move forward. The way I see it, you can either a) wait until you have as much money as you’ll be able to save before you shop, or b) scour ads for the best prices and “shop as you go.” With Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and plenty of other huge sales coming up, it might make sense to take advantage of the best deals as you find them. Do the best you can, but don’t be too hard on yourself. It sucks when you can’t afford to buy for everyone on your list, but it’s not the end of the world. A handwritten card can tell the people you love how you feel without costing much at all, and most people don’t really expect a gift anyway. If someone is disappointed this year, they’ll just have to get over it. When it comes to your financial health, you have to put yourself first – holidays or not. The Bottom Line Layaway might be fading away, but that doesn’t mean we can’t learn something from it. While it isn’t the easiest – or more convenient – way to shop for the holidays, layaway did help people stay out of debt. If you want to avoid debt this year, the time to start saving is now. Stash away as much money as you can weekly or on payday. You might have to make a few cuts to your holiday budget, but you still have time to do the best you can. While buying less may not be ideal, it’s a whole lot better than starting a brand new year with a pile of credit card debt.

All that bonding can really build up an appetite — and your grocery bill. Family gatherings can be stressful even if you don't have to plan for, purchase and cook a big holiday meal. On average, American families spend more than $50 on a single Thanksgiving meal for 10, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation’s 30th annual informal price survey. That's more than twice as much as they spent in 1987. Oh, plus the cost of turkey is up, and the canned pumpkin supply is short — two facts that could put additional stress on this year’s food budgets. Luckily, holiday hosts have cost-saving options if they visit the right stores. Here are some of the best holiday dinner deals that won't land you in the poorhouse. 1. Walmart Grocery items account for 56 percent of Walmart’s sales, so it's not surprising that the superstore consistently runs discounts on many items — including holiday dinner ingredients. Right now, you can get 50 cents off a Hungry Jack Mashed Potato product of any size. Walmart also price matches competitors — even online stores — so if you find a great holiday dinner deal somewhere else, you can ask for the same price. Not every Walmart store honors in-store price matching, though. In fact, the company recently cancelled in-store matching for 800 stores. So, you should ask the manager of your local store before you spend time comparison shopping. 2. Target Target is another large retailer that has jumped into the grocery game. The prices aren’t as low as Walmart or Aldi, but the store often runs deals on popular holiday meal items, such as turkey, stuffing, potatoes and canned goods. See: The Worst Things to Buy at Walmart and Target Coupon expert and author Jill Nystul uses Target Cartwheel digital coupons and gift card promos to score ultra-low prices on groceries — she purchased an entire Thanksgiving dinner for six to eight people for $24.32. Right now, if you choose the home delivery option for a Target online purchase, you can get a $5 to $200 gift card back, depending on what you buy. There are also coupons for $4 off Seattle’s Best Coffee, $2 off Stouffer’s Slow Cooker Starters, $1 off Finlandia Creamy Gourmet Cheese and $1.50 off Knudsen Sour Cream or Cottage Cheese. 3. Aldi Aldi’s prices are low enough to rival even consumer-favorite Trader Joe’s as one of the best cheap grocery stores. The retailer keeps costs down by offering mostly generic, in-house brands and limited sizes and varieties. Recently, Aldi featured holiday meal deals such as Appleton Farms Ham for 89 cents a pound, smoked turkey for $1.99 a pound, russet potatoes for 15 cents a pound, Brussels sprouts for $1.29 a pound and yellow onions for 69 cents a pound. Aldi can also be a source of hard-to-find items, as the holiday season heats up. “There’s a national canned pumpkin shortage right now, so I went to Albertsons to stock up, but they were out of small cans," said San Diego food blogger Michelle Sybert. "Aldi had them for under a dollar — just 89 cents per can.” 4. Sprouts Sprouts Farmers Market is one of the cheapest national grocery chains — especially for produce and meat. You won’t find many name-brand items, but there are often great deals on bulk-bin products, such as spices, nuts, dried fruits and grains. Customers love to shop there on “Double Ad Wednesday” because sale prices for both the current week and previous week are still valid. Recent deals include house-made sausage for $2.99 a pound, grass-fed beef for $5 a pound and thick-cut bacon and seafood at low prices. 5. Trader Joe’s You’re not going to find whole turkeys, but if you love pumpkin-flavored foods during the holidays, Trader Joe’s is the place to be. The retailer offers a 30-ounce pumpkin cheesecake for $6.99, a gluten-free pumpkin bread mix for $3.99 and low prices on whole pumpkins. Money-saving expert Kate Hamernik gets whole pumpkins at her local Trader Joe’s and makes her own pumpkin pie mix. “I bought several pumpkins at Trader Joe’s just last week for about $3 a piece," she said. "I put it in the crock pot and use it in all kinds of recipes — it’s so much cheaper than canned pumpkin.” 6. WinCo WinCo is another small grocer that’s giving the big guys a run for their money. In fact, a Time Money article listed it as one of America’s cheapest supermarkets in the West. Last holiday season, the company promised to beat any nearby competitor’s price on Thanksgiving turkeys — as long as minimum purchase requirements were met. The store isn’t running any holiday meal savings online yet, but you can still score deals early, such as $1 off Hormel bacon toppings and $1 off Pepto-Bismol, for the holiday dinner recovery. WinCo also takes manufacturer coupons, and you can combine those with sales and rebate app promos, like those from Ibotta, for even more savings this holiday season. 7. Boston Market Boston Market is known for its home-style cooking, so it’s a popular place for holiday fare. This year, for $13.49 a person, you can get the Boston Market Premium Buffet, which comes with an entrée of your choice, three sides, cornbread, cranberry walnut relish and an assortment of pies to make your holiday dinner complete. There is also a Deluxe Buffet option for $11.49 per person, which comes with an entrée, two sides, cornbread and pies. You can even create your own buffet starting at $10.29 a person. There is a 10-person minimum to order — and the food comes cold — so give yourself extra time to heat things up at home.

And the list of incidents keeps growing. The Southern Poverty Law Center has counted more than 300 cases of hateful harassment or intimidation in the US since Election Day. “They’ve been everywhere — in schools, in places of business like Walmart, on the street,” SPLC President Richard Cohen said Monday. While Trump has been accused of fostering xenophobia and Islamophobia, some people have used his words as justification to carry out hateful crimes. Recent days have witnessed ugly episodes of racist or anti-Semitic pro-Trump graffiti along with threats or attacks against Muslims. The President-elect said he was “so saddened” to hear about vitriol hurled by some of his supporters against minorities. “If it helps, I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it,” Trump said in an interview that aired Sunday on CBS’ “60 Minutes.” But it’s not just Trump supporters inciting attacks. A man in Chicago was beaten as a bystander yelled, “You voted Trump!” And two men in Connecticut were arrested for allegedly assaulting a Trump supporter. Here’s what some Americans are dealing with across the country. Intimidation and violence from some Trump supporters ‘Make America White Again,’ softball dugout reads New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered a joint investigation after someone painted a dugout wall in Wellsville, about 80 miles southeast of Buffalo. The message: A swastika, surrounded by the words, ‘Make America White Again.” The governor said both New York State Police and the State Division of Human Rights will investigate the alleged hate crime. “New York has zero tolerance for bigotry, fear and hatred, and those who seek to undermine the core values this state and nation were founded upon,” Cuomo said. Swastika, ‘Trump’ at New York campus Hours after Cuomo reported the Wellsville incident, the governor announced another alleged hate crime — this one at SUNY Geneseo. Someone spray-painted a swastika and the word “Trump” on a dorm building. “It is unacceptable that this is the second investigation that we have had to announce in the last several hours,” Cuomo said in a statement Saturday. “To any New Yorker who is scared, I want you to know that we have your back, that we will keep you safe, and that protecting your rights is what America stands for.” Muslim student threatened with lighter Police in Ann Arbor, Michigan, were investigating reports a man approached a Muslim student and threatened to set her on fire with a lighter unless she removed her hijab. The suspect is described as 20 to 30 years old, unkempt and intoxicated, according to the University of Michigan. The Michigan chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said the alleged attack is among a spate of anti-Muslim incidents reported since Trump won the election. “Our nation’s leaders, and particularly President-elect Donald Trump, need to speak out forcefully against the wave of anti-Muslim incidents sweeping the country after Tuesday’s election,” Executive Director Dawud Walid said. ‘Trump!’ written on Muslim prayer room door in NYC At New York University’s Tandon School of Engineering, students discovered Trump’s name written on the door to a prayer room for Muslims on Wednesday, school officials said. “Our campus is not immune to the bigotry that grips America,” the NYU Muslim Students Association said in a Facebook posting. School spokesman Kathleen Hamilton said the school has many immigrant students, with about 20% from abroad. “It’s a real melting pot here,” she said. “We all believe this very much, that the university is a place of free expression. It has to be safe to be so.” New York police are investigating. Graffiti in high school: ‘Trump,’ ‘Whites only,’ ‘White America’ Minnesota high school student Moses Karngbaye said he was terrified to see racist graffiti scrawled inside a bathroom. Someone had written “#Go back to Africa” and “Make America great again” on a toilet paper dispenser at Maple Grove Senior High School. “That’s the first time I honestly felt like crying at school,” Karngbaye told CNN affiliate WCCO. The bathroom door was also covered with graffiti, including “Whites only,” “White America” and “Trump.” Karngbaye sent photos of the graffiti to his mother, Denise Karngbaye, who told WCCO she takes the attack personally. “I train my kids to respect everybody, regardless of their race, their ethnicity, their background,” she said. Hate crime investigation at San Diego State University A San Diego State University student walking to her car was confronted by two men who made comments about Trump and Muslims, SDSU police said. “Comments made to the student indicate she was targeted because of her Muslim faith, including her wearing of a traditional garment and hijab,” SDSU President Elliot Hirshman said in a statement. The men grabbed the student’s purse and backpack and removed her keys. After the student returned from calling the police, her car was gone. The suspects are still at large. Hirshman called the incident a hate crime. “We condemn this hateful act and urge all members of our community to join us in condemning such hateful acts,” he said. “Hate crimes are destructive to the spirit of our campus, and we urge all members of our community to stand together in rejecting hate.” Graffiti: Neither black lives nor black votes matter The day after Trump’s victory, someone painted racist messages referencing the election on a wall in Durham, North Carolina. “Black lives don’t matter and neither does your votes,” the message said, according to CNN affiliate WNCN. On Thursday, crews came to paint over the graffiti. Phyllis Terry, whose family owns the JC’s Kitchen restaurant next to the graffiti, told the affiliate she was heartened by the effort to cover up the message. “I am amazed. I am really touched this morning that the community has rallied together,” she said. Nazi-themed graffiti in Philadelphia Someone spray-painted the words “Sieg Heil 2016” and “Trump” — with a swastika substituted for the T in Trump — on a building’s glass window on South Broad Street, police said. The words “Trump Rules,” “Trump Rules Black [expletive]” and the letter “T” were spray-painted on three vehicles and a house on South Sixth Street. And a swastika and “Trump” were written on a utility box at Broad and Reed streets. Police said surveillance video captured a male of unknown race spray-painting around 5 a.m. Wednesday. It was unclear if the graffiti was a protest of Trump or a pro-Nazi act. But the Anti-Defamation League has denounced it. “Swastikas and the Nazi salute send a message of intolerance and hate to the entire community,” the ADL’s regional director, Nancy K. Baron-Baer, said in a statement. Baron-Baer said the group views the graffiti as an isolated incident, but stressed that “we cannot allow this behavior to become routine.” Black doll hung from rod at college At Canisius College in west New York state, students posted photos of a black doll hanging from a dormitory curtain rod on social media, and one student created a meme with language about “Trump fans,” college President John J. Hurley said. Students who saw those photos notified campus police, who investigated, Hurley said. Some students have been suspended and may be expelled, he said. An outside investigator will be hired to determine if any students should be prosecuted for possible hate crimes, as several parents and students urged, Hurley said. He did not name the students or say how many were involved, citing privacy concerns. On Wednesday, the school held an open session on the doll incident attended by about 300 people. “It is clear to me that this episode has exposed some deeply held concerns among our students of color and that we need to go well beyond addressing the immediate incident involving the doll,” Hurley said. ‘Deportation’ letters handed out at school A student at Shasta High School in Redding, California, posted a video on Twitter of himself handing letters with the word “deportation” written across the top to half a dozen students, school district Superintendent Jim Cloney said in a statement. The students appeared to be of a variety of ethnicities, Cloney said. After talking to the student and his parents, the video was taken down. The student said he thought the video was funny, Cloney said. “Needless to say, we don’t think this sort of behavior is funny nor reflective of the culture of Shasta High,” he said. He said appropriate discipline will be applied. Violence against Trump supporters Hat-wearing supporter: I was assaulted on NYC subway Corey Cataldo was riding a subway car to the Bronx when a man asked him whether he was a Trump supporter, police spokeswoman Sgt. Jessica McRorie said. When Cataldo said yes, the man grabbed him by the neck, hurting his left shoulder, McRorie said. Cataldo, 24, was wearing a white hat with the motto “Make America Great Again” stitched on it, CNN affiliate WABC reported. The electrician told WABC that as he was being chocked another man acted like he was going to help, but shoved him against a window. McRorie said no one has been arrested and the investigation into the reported incident continues. CNN called a number listed for Cataldo and left a message seeking comment. Trump supporter beaten in Connecticut Two men were arrested for punching and kicking a Connecticut man who was waving an American flag and holding a Trump sign Saturday, Meriden police said. Wilson Eschevarria and Anthony Hobdy were charged with assault. The 45-year-old victim told police that Eschevarria and Hobdy gave him the finger and he responded, “Same to you.” That’s when the two suspects started beating him, the man told police. Man beaten as onlooker yells, ‘You voted Trump!’ David Wilcox said he was struck by another vehicle while driving in a Chicago intersection. When he got out to try to get insurance information, men from the other car started attacking him. “You voted Trump!” a bystander screamed as a man punched Wilcox in the head. Another tried to kick him in the face. Wilcox said he doesn’t think his attackers knew who he voted for. Still, the assumption was already made. Even though he was beaten on the street in broad daylight, Wilcox said, “Nobody did anything to help.” On top of that, someone stole Wilcox’s car. Police are investigating. From violence to unity Baylor University: 300 students escort victim to class Amid all the physical and verbal attacks, hundreds of Baylor University students rallied behind Natasha Nkhama to make sure she felt safe leaving class. Nkhama said she was walking to class last week when a guy “went out of his way to bump into me and shove me off the sidewalk.” “He said, ‘No n—— allowed on the sidewalk,’ ” Nkhama said in a video posted to Twitter last Wednesday. “I was just shocked, like I had no words.” Nkhama said two men she did not know defended her, asking the student what he was doing. “The guy said, ‘Dude, like what, I’m just trying to make America great again,’ ” Nkhama said. The university said it was “aware of a student who was pushed and subjected to racially offensive language,” an incident it describes as “deeply disturbing and does not in any way reflect Baylor’s faith or values.” Nkhama’s video and #IWalkWithNatasha quickly spread across social media. When Nkhama walked out of a class Friday, about 300 students stood by the door, waiting to walk her to her next class, according to campus police. Nkhama broke down in tears. “I just wanted to thank everyone for being here, and I want everyone who sees this to know that Baylor is a campus of love,” Nkhama said. She also thanked the two students who came to her defense when she was assaulted. “To whoever defended me that day, I don’t know who you are, but I thank you honestly and thank you for being an example to everyone on campus.” What the teacher said ‘Back to Africa’ comment in Florida A faculty member at a Pasco County, Florida, high school has been accused of telling a group of African-American students standing in a hallway, “Don’t make me call Donald Trump to get you sent back to Africa.” The Wesley Chapel High School teacher, who is also the golf coach, allegedly made the remark the day after Trump was elected. The school system is investigating. “As soon as the students reported the incident to administrators at the school on Wednesday, November 9, (the teacher) was sent home on administrative leave, where he remains,” Pasco County Schools spokeswoman Linda E. Cobbe told CNN. The teacher did not return a phone call and emails from CNN seeking comment.

(Kris Ketonen CBC) The Children's Aid Society of Thunder Bay has teamed up with Thunder Bay's Walmart stores to remind the community to give generously to kids in need this holiday season. The Holiday Wishes Campaign will make the city's three Walmart locations home to specially decorated trees, which people can visit if they wish to purchase a gift for a child in need.  "The goal of this campaign is to help make the holiday season a special and happy time for all children in our community," said Brad Bain, executive director at CAS, "every child should have a smile on their faces Christmas morning." "In 2014, thanks to the generosity of Thunder Bay citizens, 433 gifts were donated. Last year, 434 gifts were donated," Bain said.  "And based on the generous nature of Thunder Bay citizens, we are hoping to reach 500 donations this year."  Anyone wishing to participate in the Holiday Wishes Campaign can visit a "wishes tree" at one of the stores, pick a snowman tag, purchase an age appropriate gift for the child and return the gift along with the tag to the collection bin at each store. Agency volunteers and staff will then collect and wrap the gifts and deliver them to children's homes.

And the list of incidents keeps growing. Racist, pro-Trump graffiti painted inside a high school in Minnesota. Messages about lynchings popping up on freshmen's phones in Pennsylvania. While Trump has been accused of fostering xenophobia and Islamophobia, some people have used his words as justification to carry out hateful acts. The Southern Poverty Law Center has counted more than 300 cases of hateful harassment or intimidation since Election Day. "They've been everywhere -- in schools, in places of business like Wal-Mart, on the street," SPLC President Richard Cohen said Monday. Trump said he was "so saddened" to hear about vitriol hurled by some of his supporters against minorities. "I say, 'stop it,'" Trump said in an interview with CBS' "60 Minutes." "If it helps. I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it." But critics say those two words aren't enough. Here's what some Americans are dealing with across the country. 'Make America white again,' softball dugout reads New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered a joint investigation after someone painted a dugout wall in Wellsville, about 80 miles southeast of Buffalo. The message: A swastika, surrounded by the words 'Make America White Again." The governor said New York State Police and the State Division of Human Rights will investigate the alleged hate crime. "New York has zero tolerance for bigotry, fear and hatred, and those who seek to undermine the core values this state and nation were founded upon," Cuomo said. Swastika, 'Trump' at New York campus Hours after Cuomo reported the Wellsville incident, the governor announced another alleged hate crime -- this one at SUNY Geneseo. Someone spray-painted a swastika and the word "Trump" at a dorm building. Please enable Javascript to watch this video "It is unacceptable that this is the second investigation that we have had to announce in the last several hours," Cuomo said in a statement Saturday. "To any New Yorker who is scared, I want you to know that we have your back, that we will keep you safe, and that protecting your rights is what America stands for." Muslim student threatened with lighter Police in Ann Arbor, Mich., were investigating reports a man approached a Muslim student and threatened to set her on fire with a lighter unless she removed her hijab. Police said Saturday they were "actively investigating and soliciting leads from witnesses" to the reported incident. The suspect is described as 20 to 30 years old, unkempt and intoxicated, according to the University of Michigan. Advocacy organization CAIR-MI said the alleged attack was just the latest anti-Muslim incident reported since Trump won the election. "Our nation's leaders, and particularly President-elect Donald Trump, need to speak out forcefully against the wave of anti-Muslim incidents sweeping the country after Tuesday's election," Executive Director Dawud Walid said. Racist messages target black students Black freshmen at the University of Pennsylvania found "violent, racist and thoroughly disgusting" messages on their phones Friday after they were added to a racist GroupMe account, the university said. The account on the group messaging service appears to be based in Oklahoma, officials said, and investigators are trying to track down who's responsible. According to The Daily Pennsylvanian, the messages included racial slurs and images of lynchings. "This is absolutely vile material and completely offensive to everyone on our campus. We are both angry and saddened that it was directed to our students or to anyone. The people responsible for this are reprehensible," university officials said. "We have increased campus safety and are reaching out to support the affected students in every way we can, and want them to know that the entire Penn community stands with them." 'Trump!' written on Muslim prayer room door in NYC At the New York University Tandon School of Engineering, students discovered the name of the President-elect written on the door to a prayer room for Muslims on Wednesday, school officials said. "Our campus is not immune to the bigotry that grips America," the NYU Muslim Students Association said in a Facebook posting. School spokesman Kathleen Hamilton said the school has a lot of immigrant students, with about 20% from abroad. "It's a real melting pot here," she said. "We all believe this very much, that the university is a place of free expression. It has to be safe to be so." The NYPD is investigating. There were no cameras, and the school isn't sure whether a student is responsible, Hamilton said. She noted that all NYU buildings require a badge for access. Graffiti in high school: 'Trump,' 'Whites only,' 'White America' Student Moses Karngbaye said he was terrified to see racist graffiti sprawled inside a bathroom in his Minnesota high school. "#Go back to Africa" and "Make America great again," someone wrote on a toilet paper dispenser at Maple Grove Senior High School. "That's the first time I honestly felt like crying at school," Karngbaye told WCCO. The bathroom door was also covered with graffiti, including "Whites only," "White America" and "Trump." Karngbaye sent photos of the graffiti to his mother, who recalled another message: "Now the white people are going to take over." Denise Karngbaye told WCCO she takes the attack personally. "I train my kids to respect everybody, regardless of their race, their ethnicity, their background," she said. San Diego State University president calls incident 'hate crime' A San Diego State University student walking to her car was confronted by two men who made comments about Trump and Muslims, SDSU police said. "Comments made to the student indicate she was targeted because of her Muslim faith, including her wearing of a traditional garment and hijab," SDSU President Elliot Hirshman said in a statement. The men grabbed the student's purse and backpack and removed her keys. After the student returned from calling the police, her car was gone. The suspects are still at large. Hirshman called the incident a hate crime. "We condemn this hateful act and urge all members of our community to join us in condemning such hateful acts," he said. "Hate crimes are destructive to the spirit of our campus, and we urge all members of our community to stand together in rejecting hate." Middle school students: 'Build the wall!' A day after Trump was elected, some students at Michigan's Royal Oak Middle School started chanting in the cafeteria: "Build the wall! Build the wall!" A video of the chanting, which has been viewed millions of times on social media, appears to stop after a girl mentions the incident is being recorded. Royal Oaks Schools Superintendent Shawn Lewis-Lakin said school personnel in the cafeteria responded to the incident. "We are working with our students to help them understand the impact of their words and actions on others in their school community," the superintendent said in a statement Thursday. "Our school district and each building in it works every day to be a welcoming community for all, inclusive and caring, where all students know they are valued, safe and supported." Graffiti: Neither black lives nor black votes matter The day after Trump's victory, someone painted racist messages referencing the election on a wall in Durham, North Carolina. "Black lives don't matter and neither does your votes," the message said, according to WNCN. On Thursday, crews came to paint over the graffiti. Phyllis Terry, whose family owns the JC's Kitchen restaurant next to the graffiti, told the affiliate she was heartened by the effort to cover up the message. "I am amazed. I am really touched this morning that the community has rallied together," she said. Graffiti about 'safe space' at Louisiana university Authorities at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette discovered Wednesday morning that somebody chalked the words "Trump," "Build wall" and "[Expletive deleted] your safe space" in front of the library, The Vermillion student newspaper reported on Twitter. Campus police Lt. Billy Abrams confirmed the "safe space" chalking is being investigated because it's offensive. The other chalkings were not being investigated and all were removed with pressure washing, he said. Nazi-themed graffiti in Philadelphia The Anti-Defamation League has decried Nazi-themed graffiti that appeared in South Philadelphia. "We are horrified by the appearance of hate graffiti on a storefront in South Philadelphia," said Nancy K. Baron-Baer, the organization's regional director, in a statement posted Wednesday on the group's website. "Swastikas and the Nazi salute send a message of intolerance and hate to the entire community. The fact that today is the 78th anniversary of Kristallnacht adds another layer to this already sickening act." Kristallnacht was when Nazis rampaged through German towns on November 9-10, 1938, smashing stores and windows of buildings owned by Jews. The name of the incident, also known as "Night of the Broken Glass," refers to the shards of glass left on sidewalks. Baron-Baer said the group views the graffiti as an isolated incident but stressed that "we cannot allow this behavior to become routine." Philadelphia police reported several incidents in which walls and vehicles were defaced. So far no arrests have been made. The words "Sieg Heil 2016" and "Trump" -- with a swastika substituted for the T in Trump -- were spray-painted on a building's glass window on South Broad Street, police said. The words "Trump Rules," "Trump Rules Black [expletive]" and the letter "T" were spray-painted on three vehicles and a house on South Sixth Street. Police said surveillance video captured a male of unknown race doing the spray-painting about 5 a.m. Wednesday. A swastika and "Trump" were written on a utility box at Broad and Reed streets. It was unclear if the graffiti was a protest of Trump or a pro-Nazi act. Black doll hung from curtain rod at college At Canisius College in west New York state, students posted photos of a black doll hanging from a dormitory curtain rod on social media, and one student created a meme with language about "Trump fans," college President John J. Hurley said in a message posted on the school website. Hurley said the "disturbing incident" started when a campus visitor left the black doll in a dorm laundry room Tuesday night. Students placed the doll in an elevator as a prank, he said, and people took photos and posted them on social media. Some people mistook two strings that attached the doll's head to the body as a noose, he said. Later, students took the doll to a residence hall and hung it from the curtain rod. Students who saw those photos notified campus police, who investigated, Hurley said. Students have been suspended and may be expelled, he said. An outside investigator will be hired to determine if any students should be prosecuted for possible hate crimes, as several parents and students urged, Hurley said. He did not name the students or say how many were involved, citing privacy concerns. On Wednesday, the school held an open session on the doll incident attended by about 300 people. "It is clear to me that this episode has exposed some deeply held concerns among our students of color and that we need to go well beyond addressing the immediate incident involving the doll," Hurley said. California student: Man yanked my hijab A student at San Jose State University said she was walking to her car in a parking garage Wednesday afternoon when a man came up behind her and pulled at her head scarf. The force he used caused the victim to lose her balance and choked her. The suspect, who ran away, was a fair-skinned male wearing a dark colored hooded sweatshirt. Campus officials are investigating. "No one should experience this kind of behavior at San Jose State," the school said. Students staged a rally on Wednesday morning at the Tommie Smith and John Carlos statue to protest the election of Donald Trump, the San Jose Mercury-News reported. A fight broke out between Trump supporters and other students, the newspaper said. 'Deportation' letters handed out at school A student at Shasta High School in Redding, California, posted a video on Twitter of himself handing letters with the word "deportation" written across the top to half a dozen students, school district Superintendent Jim Cloney said in a statement. The students appeared to be of a variety of ethnicities, Cloney said. After talking to the student and his parents, the video was taken down, Cloney said. The student said he thought the video was funny, Cloney said. "Needless to say, we don't think this sort of behavior is funny nor reflective of the culture of Shasta High," he said. He said appropriate discipline will be applied.

And the list of incidents keeps growing. Racist, pro-Trump graffiti painted inside a high school in Minnesota. Messages about lynchings popping up on black students’ phones at the University of Pennsylvania. The Southern Poverty Law Center has counted more than 300 cases of hateful harassment or intimidation in the five days since Election Day. “They’ve been everywhere — in schools, in places of business like Walmart, on the street,” SPLC President Richard Cohen said Monday. While Trump has been accused of fostering xenophobia and Islamophobia, some people have used his words as justification to carry out hateful acts. Trump said he was “so saddened” to hear about vitriol hurled by some of his supporters against minorities. “I say, ‘stop it,'” Trump said in an interview with CBS’ “60 Minutes.” “If it helps, I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it.” But it’s not just Trump supporters inciting attacks. A man in Chicago was beaten as a bystander yelled, “You voted Trump!” Here’s what some Americans are dealing with across the country. Intimidation and violence from some Trump supporters ‘Make America White Again,’ softball dugout reads New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered a joint investigation after someone painted a dugout wall in Wellsville, about 80 miles southeast of Buffalo. The message: A swastika, surrounded by the words, ‘Make America White Again.” The governor said both New York State Police and the State Division of Human Rights will investigate the alleged hate crime. “New York has zero tolerance for bigotry, fear and hatred, and those who seek to undermine the core values this state and nation were founded upon,” Cuomo said. Swastika, ‘Trump’ at New York campus Hours after Cuomo reported the Wellsville incident, the governor announced another alleged hate crime — this one at SUNY Geneseo. Someone spray-painted a swastika and the word “Trump” on a dorm building. “It is unacceptable that this is the second investigation that we have had to announce in the last several hours,” Cuomo said in a statement Saturday. “To any New Yorker who is scared, I want you to know that we have your back, that we will keep you safe, and that protecting your rights is what America stands for.” Muslim student threatened with lighter Police in Ann Arbor, Michigan, were investigating reports a man approached a Muslim student and threatened to set her on fire with a lighter unless she removed her hijab. The suspect is described as 20 to 30 years old, unkempt and intoxicated, according to the University of Michigan. The Michigan chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said the alleged attack is among a spate of anti-Muslim incidents reported since Trump won the election. “Our nation’s leaders, and particularly President-elect Donald Trump, need to speak out forcefully against the wave of anti-Muslim incidents sweeping the country after Tuesday’s election,” Executive Director Dawud Walid said. ‘Trump!’ written on Muslim prayer room door in NYC At New York University’s Tandon School of Engineering, students discovered Trump’s name written on the door to a prayer room for Muslims on Wednesday, school officials said. “Our campus is not immune to the bigotry that grips America,” the NYU Muslim Students Association said in a Facebook posting. School spokesman Kathleen Hamilton said the school has many immigrant students, with about 20% from abroad. “It’s a real melting pot here,” she said. “We all believe this very much, that the university is a place of free expression. It has to be safe to be so.” New York police are investigating. Graffiti in high school: ‘Trump,’ ‘Whites only,’ ‘White America’ Minnesota high school student Moses Karngbaye said he was terrified to see racist graffiti scrawled inside a bathroom. Someone had written “#Go back to Africa” and “Make America great again” on a toilet paper dispenser at Maple Grove Senior High School. “That’s the first time I honestly felt like crying at school,” Karngbaye told CNN affiliate WCCO. The bathroom door was also covered with graffiti, including “Whites only,” “White America” and “Trump.” Karngbaye sent photos of the graffiti to his mother, Denise Karngbaye, who told WCCO she takes the attack personally. “I train my kids to respect everybody, regardless of their race, their ethnicity, their background,” she said. Hate crime investigation at San Diego State University A San Diego State University student walking to her car was confronted by two men who made comments about Trump and Muslims, SDSU police said. “Comments made to the student indicate she was targeted because of her Muslim faith, including her wearing of a traditional garment and hijab,” SDSU President Elliot Hirshman said in a statement. The men grabbed the student’s purse and backpack and removed her keys. After the student returned from calling the police, her car was gone. The suspects are still at large. Hirshman called the incident a hate crime. “We condemn this hateful act and urge all members of our community to join us in condemning such hateful acts,” he said. “Hate crimes are destructive to the spirit of our campus, and we urge all members of our community to stand together in rejecting hate.” Graffiti: Neither black lives nor black votes matter The day after Trump’s victory, someone painted racist messages referencing the election on a wall in Durham, North Carolina. “Black lives don’t matter and neither does your votes,” the message said, according to CNN affiliate WNCN. On Thursday, crews came to paint over the graffiti. Phyllis Terry, whose family owns the JC’s Kitchen restaurant next to the graffiti, told the affiliate she was heartened by the effort to cover up the message. “I am amazed. I am really touched this morning that the community has rallied together,” she said. Nazi-themed graffiti in Philadelphia Someone spray-painted the words “Sieg Heil 2016” and “Trump” — with a swastika substituted for the T in Trump — on a building’s glass window on South Broad Street, police said. The words “Trump Rules,” “Trump Rules Black [expletive]” and the letter “T” were spray-painted on three vehicles and a house on South Sixth Street. And a swastika and “Trump” were written on a utility box at Broad and Reed streets. Police said surveillance video captured a male of unknown race spray-painting around 5 a.m. Wednesday. It was unclear if the graffiti was a protest of Trump or a pro-Nazi act. But the Anti-Defamation League has denounced it. “Swastikas and the Nazi salute send a message of intolerance and hate to the entire community,” the ADL’s regional director, Nancy K. Baron-Baer, said in a statement. Baron-Baer said the group views the graffiti as an isolated incident, but stressed that “we cannot allow this behavior to become routine.” Black doll hung from rod at college At Canisius College in west New York state, students posted photos of a black doll hanging from a dormitory curtain rod on social media, and one student created a meme with language about “Trump fans,” college President John J. Hurley said. Students who saw those photos notified campus police, who investigated, Hurley said. Some students have been suspended and may be expelled, he said.

The student said he thought the video was funny, Cloney said. “Needless to say, we don’t think this sort of behavior is funny nor reflective of the culture of Shasta High,” he said. He said appropriate discipline will be applied. Violence against Trump supporters Man beaten as onlooker yells, ‘You voted Trump!’ David Wilcox said he was struck by another vehicle while driving in a Chicago intersection. When he got out to try to get insurance information, men from the other car started attacking him. “You voted Trump!” a bystander screamed as a man punched Wilcox in the head. Another tried to kick him in the face. Wilcox said he doesn’t think his attackers knew who he voted for. Still, the assumption was already made. Even though he was beaten on the street in broad daylight, Wilcox said, “Nobody did anything to help.” On top of that, someone stole Wilcox’s car. Police are investigating. From violence to unity Baylor University: 300 students escort victim to class Amid all the physical and verbal attacks, hundreds of Baylor University students rallied behind Natasha Nkhama to make sure she felt safe leaving class. Nkhama said she was walking to class last week when a guy “went out of his way to bump into me and shove me off the sidewalk.” “He said, ‘No n—— allowed on the sidewalk,’ ” Nkhama said in a video posted to Twitter last Wednesday. “I was just shocked, like I had no words.” Nkhama said two men she did not know defended her, asking the student what he was doing. “The guy said, ‘Dude, like what, I’m just trying to make America great again,’ ” Nkhama said. The university said it was “aware of a student who was pushed and subjected to racially offensive language,” an incident it describes as “deeply disturbing and does not in any way reflect Baylor’s faith or values.” Nkhama’s video and #IWalkWithNatasha quickly spread across social media. When Nkhama walked out of a class Friday, about 300 students stood by the door, waiting to walk her to her next class, according to campus police. Nkhama broke down in tears. “I just wanted to thank everyone for being here, and I want everyone who sees this to know that Baylor is a campus of love,” Nkhama said. She also thanked the two students who came to her defense when she was assaulted. “To whoever defended me that day, I don’t know who you are, but I thank you honestly and thank you for being an example to everyone on campus.” 37.090240 -95.712891 Related stories Reports of Hate Crimes and Racist Graffiti, Including in California, Following Trump’s Election Win Filed in: Nation/World, Politics Topics: donald trump, election 2016 Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Pinterest Email KTLA 5 News on Instagram Popular JetBlue Flash Sale Offers Flights as Low as $34; Book by Wednesday Video Shows Chili’s Manager Taking Away Free Meal From Army Veteran in Texas Security Cameras Capture Anaheim Mother and 2-Year-Old Son Attacked by 2 Dogs Ku Klux Klan to Hold Donald Trump Victory Parade in North Carolina Latest News Youth Football Team Needs Help to go to National Championships in Florida Man Pinned by Maintenance Vehicle While Sleeping in Venice Beach Speaks of Ordeal Facebook, Google to Stop Ads From Appearing on Fake News Sites New Citizens Sworn in During Pasadena Ceremony a Week After Donald Trump Wins Presidency Are Optimistic For Future Nation/World Politics In First Interview Since Winning Election, Donald Trump Addresses Divided Nation Nation/World Politics Donald Trump Says He Will Accept Presidential Election Results ‘If I Win’ Politics Donald Trump Rules Out Pathway to Legal Status for Undocumented Immigrants Nation/World Politics ‘Not My President’: Anti-Trump Protests Erupt Around the U.S. Following Election Nation/World Politics Obama: Trump’s Statement That Election Could Be ‘Rigged’ Is ‘Ridiculous’ Politics Trump’s Bid for Black Voters: ‘What the Hell Do You Have to Lose?’ Politics Donald Trump Took Softer Tone on Undocumented Immigrants in 2012 Nation/World From Honolulu to Miami, Anti-Trump Protests Spread Across Nation Nation/World Politics Election Day 2016 Finally Arrives Following Divisive Campaign Nation/World Politics Trump Promises Major Speech Amid Immigration Plan Questions Election Guide Politics Donald Trump Made Cameo Popping Champagne in Adult Video Nation/World Politics Trump’s Controversies Pile Up as Election Day Draws Closer Politics Hillary Clinton Expresses Regret for Calling Half of Donald Trump Supporters ‘Deplorables’ Mobile Apps Android App iPhone & iPad App KTLA 5 News on Social Media Watch CW Shows Facebook Twitter Instagram Email Alerts About & Contact screenertv Screener Online Public File • Terms of Service • Privacy Policy • 5800 Sunset Blvd. Los Angeles, CA, 90028 • Copyright © 2016, KTLA • A Tribune Broadcasting Station • Powered by WordPress.com VIP × Email Alerts Send to Email Address Your Name Your Email Address Cancel Post was not sent - check your email addresses!

Neenah lags on scanner, gas pump inspections Duke Behnke , USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin 6:29 a.m. CST November 14, 2016 Buy Photo According to the seal, Neenah last inspected this gas pump for accuracy in July 2014. The state recommends gas pumps be inspected annually. (Photo: Duke Behnke/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin)Buy Photo 24 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Question: I was overcharged, again, at the Neenah Walmart. This time it was for apples, which rang up 20 cents more per pound than advertised. What government agency checks for such errors? How often are the checks done? How can I file a complaint? Answer: I, too, have been overcharged at the aforementioned store, but my issue concerned boxes of Junior Mints, which were marked at $2.54 but rang up at $2.68. I pointed out the error to a store manager, but weeks passed before the discrepancy was resolved, so others likely were overcharged as well. Neenah's Weights and Measures Department is responsible for the inspection and enforcement of accurate pricing at large grocery stores. The problem is Neenah's most recent city sealer, Cassandra Slocum, left the job more than a year ago, and her position has not been filled. RELATED: Police spending up in Neenah budget​ WATCHDOG Q&A: Duke Behnke answers your questions State law doesn't specify how often bar-code scanners, scales, gas pumps and packaged weights need to be inspected for accuracy, but Judy Cardin, director of the state Bureau of Weights and Measures, said the guideline for cities with a population of 5,000 or more is that the inspections should be done annually. "We know from how problems occur that that's probably the interval you want to be at," Cardin said. Neenah is falling out of compliance. I saw a sticker on a Neenah gas pump that says it was last inspected in July 2014. Chris Haese, Neenah's director of community development and assessment, acknowledged that no inspections have been done since Slocum left. In the short term, Haese said he will propose contracting with the Oshkosh city sealer to bring Neenah into compliance. In the long term, Haese requested $65,340 in the 2017 budget for a full-time weights and measures/code enforcement officer. Mayor Dean Kaufert reduced the request to $49,000 and recommended the city not fill the position until April. Normally, consumers can file a complaint regarding an inaccurate Neenah scanner, scale or pump by calling the city sealer at 920-886-6164 or by sending an email to citysealer@ci.neenah.wi.us. With no one in the position, I suggest filing a complaint with the state Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection by calling 608-224-4942 or by sending an email to datcpweightsandmeasures@wi.gov.

Arkansas Blog Archives | RSS « Chris Christie will join Donald Tru…  |  Asa Hutchinson: "It's up to Arkansa… » Saturday, February 27, 2016 The Donald Trump show in Bentonville Posted By David Ramsey on Sat, Feb 27, 2016 at 12:08 PM Donald Trump, an insult comic with possibly fascist leanings who is the current GOP frontrunner for president, is holding a rally in Bentonville today. You can watch the livestream here. UPDATE: Trump (with an assist from Chris Christie) lobbed lots of insults at Rubio. They said he was a little guy with a little mouth and big ears who sweats a lot and never shows up to work. "I'm a strong guy," Trump said, explaining that he almost had to catch the tiny, fresh-mouthed Rubio because he thought he would faint. And so on.  "We gotta win Arkansas," Trump said. "Maybe I'll start shopping permanently at Walmart if we win Arkansas."  Trump barely talked about policy, other than to say that he wanted to change libel laws so that he could be more aggressive in suing the media if they dared to write mean stuff about him. Also this: "We should have a new Air Force One, it's very old." And you may have heard — he wants to build a wall along the Mexican border and make Mexico pay for it. Trump was much more interested in talking about the minutia of his personal finances and various pieces of pending litigation. On and on, like a drunk uncle over-sharing. Trump said that he might ask the judge handling the fraud case regarding his scam school, Trump University, to recuse himself. Trump mentioned the judge's ethnicity twice ("he's Hispanic, which is fine"). Later, Trump asked if there were any Hispanics in the crowd. Pointing, he said: "There's a Hispanic. In Arkansas, we have about three [Hispanics]. And that's okay." My real-time responses in the liveblog below (after the jump), including my confused conclusions about what Trump's fans want and the cult of personality that he projects.  LIVEBLOG:   The Trump plane has arrived. The cult of personality vibe of seeing his name in giant letters on a plane is, well, here you go:  click to enlarge Trump and Christie have arrived. Only half an hour late.  Christie says, "We need Arkansas to be big and strong for Donald Trump." Christie says that Rubio "doesn't work at all." Slams him for never showing up for Senate committee meetings. "Hey Marco, show up for work," he says. He says that Rubio has missed 80 percent of committee meetings. Does anyone care about this line of attack? I doubt it.  Christie to Rubio: "Unlike the U.S. Senate, president of the United States is not a no-show job, so you're not qualified." Missing senate meetings is kind of a meh attack, but I think the idea is to keep peddling the argument that Rubio is a lightweight who isn't ready. That might work with some older GOP based voters on the fence and Christie is a good surrogate to give some substantive heft to Trump's insult routine.  Christie on the debates: "When the pressure is on, Donald Trump fought like a man." By contrast, "You saw what happened to Rubio. He melted." Trump is a manly man and Rubio is a girly girl. This is the strategy that I guess works to rally the GOP base. So there you go. What a country.  Trump says politicians are "all talk, no action." He calls Rubio a "lightweight" — "little mouth on him, bing bing bing bing."  Trump: "I borrowed a tiny amount of money — I borrowed a million dollars." Trump talks about polls, a lot. He complains that we're losing and that companies are moving to Ireland ("Ireland!"). He says unemployment isn't 5 percent, like those weirdo statisticians at the Department of Labor say. Really, it's 25 percent.  "I will address little Rubio," he says. "This guy has a fresh mouth, he's a nasty guy." Trump says Rubio is an even bigger liar than Cruz.  Trump and Christie are obsessed with the debate in which Rubio awkwardly repeated himself. They've said various versions of the word meltdown a dozen times.  Trump's fascistic instincts: He says that when he's president, he's going to change libel laws so that he can more easily sue the media for stories they write about him. "We're going to open up the libel laws so we can sue the media and get damages. It'll be amazing how honest they become."  Trump says he's never seen a human being sweat so much as Rubio. "Thank God he has such big ears to catch all that sweat," he says. Trump says that Rubio was so sweaty and nervous, he thought he was going to faint. "I'm a pretty strong guy, I got ready to grab him," Trump says. "I thought he was going to go down."  Trump says that Rubio sweats so much it looks like he's just coming out of a swimming pool and Rubio puts on so much makeup it's like he's "putting it on with a trowel." These are stale jokes from yesterday.  Trump says that the reason that he's beating Rubio by 20 points in Florida is because Florida voters "can't stand the guy."  "We gotta win Arkansas," Trump says. "Maybe I'll start shopping permanently at Walmart if we win Arkansas." Trump's core message: "Politicians are never going to get you to the promised land."  He notes that he got into Wharton because he's so smart. He says he'll say crazy stuff as president. "They'll say it's unpresidential but I don't care," he says.  Trump is so much more comfortable talking about his finances and pending litigation than he is about policy or even politics. He loves talking about the micro-details, like, the statute of limitations on some legal fight over real estate or the labor market in Palm Springs or some sleazebag trying to shake him down over a casino deal or whatever. He just told a very convoluted story about some lawsuit he's fighting — honestly, I didn't follow the details — and said "this is more interesting than talking about trade." He's like a drunk uncle over-sharing. Trump just said he was before a judge "who's Hispanic, which is fine."  Later: "There's a Hispanic. In Arkansas, we have about three [Hispanics]. And that's okay."  Trump says "little Rubio" got a sweetheart deal on selling his house to a lobbyist.  "I'm so non-litigious, it's amazing," he says. Very little policy in this speech but at the end, Trump runs through a list: build a wall in Mexico, repeal and replace Obamacare, protect the Second Amendment, some incoherent stuff about trade. And change libel laws so he can shut mean journalists up. Plus this: "We should have a new Air Force One, it's very old."  Ted Cruz? He's a Canadian, Trump says. On the other hand, Trump says he likes General MacArthur and General Patton. Trump says "waterboarding is great, but we have to go stronger." Here is why I can never really understand what's going on in the GOP primaries, why I can never quite relate: So much of this stuff is about expressions of masculinity that have such a sad, sad, sad, sad "protest too much" feel to them that it's hard for me to take it seriously. If someone constantly talks about how tough and manly he is and how everyone else is not tough and manly enough, it's hard not to laugh. Because it's laughable. That's uncharitable, I know, but it's funny! My understanding of this Trump rally is that the wild fear and the deep crisis of masculinity runs so deeply for a subset of the GOP base that Trump's strongman routine registers not as a joke, not as a depressing late-night Vegas act, not as an overwritten SNL routine, not as creeping crypto-fascism — but as virile salvation.  click to enlarge Tweet Instapaper Share Favorite Saving… Comments (45) Email   Sort Oldest to Newest Newest to Oldest Most Liked Comments (45) Showing 1-45 of 45 Add a comment   Subscribe to this thread: By Email Subscribing… With RSS Showing 1-45 of 45 Comment Add a comment Subscribe to this thread More by David Ramsey Democrats' last stand in NE Arkansas Nate Looney vs. Rep.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Search on for family of man killed after electrical shock Sunday Nov 13, 2016 at 11:46 AM Nov 13, 2016 at 5:16 PM Staff Reports VICTORVILLE — A man who was shocked and suffered severe burns near a defunct Wal-Mart last month in an alleged effort to steal wiring has died. On Sunday, authorities were seeking his next of kin. Eric Hester, 33, died three days after he was found Oct. 11 in the wee hours of the morning by a Southern California Edison employee who was responding to a notification that a transformer was down in the 15000 block of Bear Valley Road. The SCE worker called authorities after finding Hester lying near the transformer. Hester was breathing and appeared to be in severe pain, having suffered burns to more than half his body, according to San Bernardino County Sheriff's officials. "Evidence at the scene indicated that Hester had broken into the transformer case in an attempt to steal wiring," the sheriff-coroner's office recapped Sunday. "Hester began cutting the wires when he received an electrical shock, causing the severe burns. The damage to the transformer caused a major power outage to a very large portion of the community." Hester, who was apparently a transient, was taken to Arrowhead Regional Medical Center in Colton where he died from his injuries Oct. 14. The sheriff-coroner's office is seeking the public's assistance in locating Hester's next of kin. He is described as black, 5-foot-10-inches tall and weighing 240 pounds, with black hair and brown eyes. Anyone with information about his family or next of kin is urged to call 909-387-2978.

Patricia Pautke went into the store to browse the Halloween selection last week, but as she was leaving, she was stopped by a store employee. “He said ‘Ma’am are you pregnant?’ and I said ‘Yes I am,’ and he said ‘You did not look pregnant five minutes ago,’” Pautke told KOB. “He said, ‘I’m going to need you to lift up your shirt right now and prove to me that you don’t have anything under your shirt.’” Pautke said at the front of the store, in front of other employees and customers, she lifted up her shirt. She said only when she proved she wasn’t hiding anything did employee told her to have a good day. “I couldn’t believe this happened to me,” Pautke said. “I’ve never heard of this happening before and how humiliated and embarrassed I was that they didn’t even take me into a room.” Pautke was able to speak with the manager, who apologized after watching the surveillance video, but she still filed a report with the Santa Fe Police Department. “You can’t just apologize and make this experience go away. You know, I’ve thought about it daily since it happened, and it’s just really traumatized me,” she said. Walmart’s Senior manager of Corporate Communications Leslee Wright released a statement regarding the incident. “We’re sorry for the experience Ms. Pautke had in our store,” the release said. “We take this seriously and are looking into it. We will take action as appropriate.” As for Pautke, she doesn’t plan on returning to that Walmart location because she doesn’t want to have a chance of interacting with that employee again.

The vote was close, but students elected to send CGH Medical Center the money, where it went to buy rubber duckies for kids who are a little nervous about a visit to the emergency room. Caption(Philip Marruffo/pmarruffo@saukvalley.com) When teacher Julia Guerrero asked her third-grade class at Washington Elementary School in Sterling how many of them had been in the emergency room, they all raised their hands. It’s no wonder then that the students decided the money Guerrero’s daughter found should go to CGH Medical Center, where the cash went into a sound investment: Kids' smiles, courtesy of rubber duckies that will be used to ease the anxiety of a visit to the ER. Caption(Philip Marruffo/pmarruffo@saukvalley.com) Julia Guerrero talks to her students Monday morning at Washington Elementary School in Sterling about the $40 her daughter found and where the money ended up, money that went to a good cause after she let her class decide what should be done with it. Their choice: CGH Medical Center, where the dough went for rubber duckies that will help ease their fellow kids’ anxiety when they’re in the ER. Caption(Philip Marruffo/pmarruffo@saukvalley.com) Manuel Mejia smiles as his third-grade teacher, Mrs. Guerrero, tells the class how $40 donated to CGH Medical Center was used to buy rubber duckies for kids who come to the emergency room. BY CHRISTOPHER HEIMERMAN cheimerman@saukvalley.com 815-625-3600, ext. 5523 CHeimerman_SVM STERLING – It’s true, kids will be kids. They play like there’s no tomorrow and sometimes horse around, and as a result, they break bones. Get nosebleeds. Get stitches. Many of them also have hearts of gold, like the 25 kiddos in Julia Guerrero’s third-grade class at Washington Elementary School. About a month ago, Guerrero’s daughter, Vanessa, 12, found $40 on the ground at a cross-country meet at Hoover Park. Her mom gave her number to Sterling High Principal Jason Austin and they waited for weeks, but no one called to claim the loot. So she gave her 25 friends – that's what she calls them: “All my students are my extra-wonderful friends” – a mighty creative creative writing assignment: Convince me who should get the money. They suggested cancer research, the donation buckets at Walmart, the library, and CGH Medical Center. They even wanted to buy school supplies for kids who couldn’t afford them, or help families at CGH who can’t afford health care. “See? That’s why I couldn’t choose,” she said Friday. “So I did what I always do: I gave it to them, because they always make such great decisions.” They voted, and CGH edged out cancer research by a single vote. After all, they know families who've been there, and they've been there themselves, Guerrero found out this morning.  Kimberly Vazquez, 8, broke her leg jumping on her cousin’s trampoline. “My leg went one way, and my ankle went the other,” she said. Joe Duffy, 8, was there for a bloody nose that “just automatically happened.” Ross Eden, 8, went to the ER for an ear infection, but found out he was allergic to his medication. “It gave me a rash, and it drove me crazy,” he said. So he had to go back and get a new prescription. A couple of weeks ago, in accordance with the kids’ vote, Guerrero stuffed the money in an envelope with a note and mailed it to CGH. “It was just a relief to get it off my person and into an envelope, before I lost it,” she said. Then she forgot about it. Her husband, Cesar, teaches Spanish at the high school, and they have another daughter, 16-year-old Cecilia, so it’s no surprise everyday busy life allowed the gift to slip her mind. That was until Thursday, when Sauk Valley Media reached out to her to let her know that $40 had turned into rubber duckies for little kids who are admitted to the ER. “Oh, my gosh,” she said. “Now I’m just a crying mess. What a wonderful little group of friends for sure. I can’t wait to tell them, and I have to wait until Monday.” There was no school Friday, so Guerrero and SVM kept the secret until 8:15 this morning, when she let the rubber ducky out of the bag. “Do you want to hear what happened at the end of the story?” she asked them, doing her best to contain her excitement. “How many of you have ever been to the emergency room?” Every hand went up. “How many of you remember feeling scared, or not sure what was going to happen?” Back up with every hand. “That $40 we gave to the hospital went to buy little rubber duckies for the boys and girls who go to the emergency room, who might feel scared and worried or a little bit sick and upset, just like you might feel.” The children’s eyes lit up with amazement, and many of them smiled and looked at one another, no doubt silently reflecting on the good deed they'd done together. “Isn’t it wonderful that the end of our story has such a wonderful, happy ending?” Guerrero said. When Anaya Perales, 8, broke her leg jumping on the couch with her brother, she got some stickers. They helped, but she said a rubber ducky would mean even more. Kimberly agreed. “I was scared, but I’d be happy if I got one of those,” she said. What’s more comforting, more innocent than a rubbery ducky? Guerrero’s 25 friends’ compassion. That’s what.

Updated: November 15, 2016 @ 11:53 pm Full Forecast News Sports Life Entertainment Dining Buy & Sell Close AP Can Amazon.com Conquer China With Prime? newsfeedback@fool.com (Adam Levy) Updated 40 min ago 0 Image source: Amazon.com. It's been more than a decade since Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) entered China, and it still owns less than 3% of the market. Despite the rapid growth of e-commerce in China, Amazon faces stiff competition from local companies such as JD.com (NASDAQ: JD). At the end of last month, Amazon launched Prime in China, hoping to replicate the success it's had with the service in the United States and other Prime markets. Prime is one of the three pillars of Amazon's growth, and it's kept its sales outpacing overall e-commerce growth in the United States for years to come. Amazon is hoping its program can have similar results in China. A few key differences Unlike the Prime you're probably familiar with, Prime in China will be drastically different. It costs 388 yuan ($57) per year and offers free shipping on orders over 200 yuan ($29.50). But that free shipping isn't nearly as fast as Prime's typical two-day promise. It'll take five to nine days for shipments to reach its destination. That's because most shipments will be coming from one of Amazon's fulfillment centers in the United States or Europe. What's more, Chinese Prime members won't have access to Prime Video, Music, or the Kindle Lending Library. Those are features that add a ton of value to Prime and keep members renewing their subscriptions year after year. CFO Brian Olsavsky told analysts on Amazon's second-quarter earnings call that members who use Prime Video have higher renewal rates than those that don't. Amazon isn't the only e-retailer with a membership program. JD.com's JD Plus includes free access to e-books and five free deliveries per month for just 149 yuan ($22) per year. JD recently acquired Wal-Mart's (NYSE: WMT) online operations in China. The deal gave JD access to fresh foods and imported goods, giving it even broader appeal. Amazon may still have an edge on imported goods -- and Prime in China is designed to highlight that advantage -- but JD is working to catch up quickly. Big investments in Prime China is just the latest market for Amazon to launch Prime. During its third-quarter earnings call, Olsavsky pointed to expansion of Prime -- specifically in India -- as a big cost driver, which led to lower-than-expected earnings results. Now, launching in another massive market, Amazon could face another huge increase in expenses as it rolls out the logistics network necessary to fulfill Prime shipments. Operating loss on Amazon's international segment grew 160% last quarter as it upped its investments in Prime. Even so, sales grew only marginally faster than they did in the United States. On the other hand, the continued strength of the United States points to the value of a good membership program like Prime. While the upfront costs are significant, the payoff is continual revenue growth for years to come. Prime in China is targeted toward members of China's growing middle class who have spent some time abroad and desire more imported goods. Cross-border e-commerce is one of the fastest growing segments of online sales in China, growing at upwards of 50%, according to the McKinsey Institute. And it already accounts for about 6% of online sales. If Amazon establishes a foothold in cross-border shipments, it could finally start to show considerable strength in China. From the pessimist's viewpoint, it will take a lot of investment to establish Prime in China. But Amazon has the cash necessary to fund the program. From the optimist's viewpoint, Amazon's current share of the gigantic Chinese e-commerce market is minuscule, so the upside potential in sales is massive.

(WAVY) — A wanted man came close to hitting a police officer with his vehicle Saturday in Newport News. At 9″45 a.m., officers responded to the parking lot of the Wal-Mart at 6111 Jefferson Avenue after an anonymous tipster got a call that a wanted person, 41-year-old John Edward Thacker, was there. Police saw the vehicle described by the caller entering the parking lot. Thacker was inside. Officers approached the vehicle and ordered Thacker to get out. Police say Thacker then recklessly sped forward to evade police, nearly hitting an officer. The officer took warrants out against Thacker for reckless driving, evading and eluding, and driving while under suspension. Thacker, of the 3000 block of Elsom Moscot Drive in Mattaponi, is still at large.

As president of a union with a long track record of standing up for all workers — not just our members — I support giving our Assembly and state Senate members a long-denied decent wage for the important work they do on behalf of all New Yorkers. This issue is even more important now that we are facing political upheaval in Washington with the election of Donald Trump. Now more than ever, we need to be able to attract the most qualified people to our state Legislature to protect New York against an incoming president whose reckless campaign promises about building a wall, dismantling the Affordable Care Act and other issues could hurt New Yorkers. We know from our work helping to spearhead the Fight for $15 and the daily challenge of improving the lives of all workers just how important raising wages is in attracting and retaining individuals who build knowledge and experience over the years — at airports, at residential buildings, at fast-food restaurants and across all industries. Many companies — even Wal-Mart — have come around to this truism: Pay people better and they do better on the job, because they feel more valued. In the workplace, this decreases turnover and makes for a more stable environment. In the Legislature, this will attract the kind of energetic and talented candidates who may be reluctant to run for office now. Lawmakers have earned a base pay of $79,500 since the last raise in 1999. The commission is considering a raise to as much as $116,000. Yes, that's a hefty increase, but it's not out-of-line for people who have gone without a raise for nearly two decades, something that could never happen in any other industry that wanted to attract and keep the best people. The current base salary is also well below the $148,500 members of the New York City Council earn, and the $174,000 paid to members of Congress. The increase is comparable to the percentage public sector union workers have received since 1999. Those recommendations would be binding unless lawmakers vote to reject or change them. Right now, the pay isn't enough to keep up with high cost of living, so legislators are driven to seek outside work, which can be distracting, or worse, lead to conflicts of interest or ethical violations. Making the Legislature full-time — and paying lawmakers a real, full-time wage — could go a long way toward restoring public confidence in Albany lawmakers. For his part, Gov. Andrew Cuomo is saying he won't support a raise unless it is tied to an ethics package, while pushing substantial pay hikes for members of his cabinet. This is yet another example of the same old Albany horse-trading that affects all legislation and has put the brakes on previous legislative pay raises. Ethics reform should be a top priority, but linking the two is unnecessary. Each issue can and will stand on its own merit. We respectfully disagree with the governor on this issue and call on the commission to do the right thing and give our state lawmakers a long overdue raise — especially in light of our suddenly changing times.

(Photo: iHeartMedia) It's Christmas time in the city. At least on the airwaves.  The folks at KESZ-FM (99.9 KEZ) have announced the return of non-stop Christmas music, starting Tuesday, Nov. 15, and continuing through Dec. 25. They haven't announced a particular start time for the switch to Christmas music for a reason. The station will give away $2,500 in "Christmas cash" to the 99th person who calls in at 602-260-0999 after the start of the first Christmas song. They've been launching the holiday season the week before Thanksgiving for a while now. As program director Paul Kelley explains it, "We try to keep our finger on the pulse of the listeners. And after Halloween we start getting the early adapters wanting to know when and encouraging us to go. It used to be that our station would beat Target to the punch. But now, Target and Wal-Mart, boy, they're ready before even the Halloween stuff is taken down." MORE MUSIC: Phoenix concerts of the week: Ringo Starr, Barenaked Ladies, Il Divo, AZ Hip Hop Festival | Latest concert announcements There are those who would argue that this is too early to ring in the holiday season. "There are people who will never want to hear Christmas music," Kelley says. "And the good thing about our building is that we have other stations that will play things like Maroon 5 and Adele and the '80s music that the people want to hear. But overwhelmingly? We wouldn't do it if the listeners didn't want us to." This is Kelley's second year in Phoenix, having moved from Colorado, where, as he says, "When the snow starts to fall or it drops below 35 degrees, it feels like Christmas. Here, there's no indication that it's Christmas time. So over the last 30 years, KEZ has sort of become the indicator of 'OK, it's time to put the tree up. It's time to celebrate. When the Christmas music goes on KEZ, that means the holidays are here." And this year, in particular, he says, there's no harm in spreading that holiday cheer a little early. "I think people, especially this year, are looking for something to give them comfort," Kelley says. "It's been a pretty rough-and-tumble year for a lot of people. The election's over, but the discussion is certainly not over about what's to come. And the majority of our playlist is from the 1940s through the 1960s. People look forward to hearing Bing Crosby and Andy Williams and Johnny Mathis. Even the young kids, even though the music is 40, 50, 60 years old, it's now part of their tradition as well." MORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL: Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest The station doesn't have a running countdown of the most-requested songs (although it's not too late to start one this year and then play that countdown Christmas day, but that's just an awesome suggestion). So what kind of records are people requesting? "The kids always want to hear 'Frosty' and 'Rudolph,'" Kelley says. "The moms and dads, especially in the beginning, want to hear the traditional songs: 'It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas,' 'Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree,' 'Jingle Bell Rock.' And as we get a couple of weeks out from Christmas, those requests start to turn to some of the traditional hymns, like 'Silent Night,' 'O Little Town of Bethlehem.' It really is a mixed bag, but typically, it is the older stuff that they take comfort in and can reminisce about their own childhood." CONTEST: Enter to win a Disney Cruise line trip for four, including airfare That extends to the rock-and-roll holidays standards as well. Kelley says, "We play Elvis, the Beach Boys, Hall and Oates, Bruce Springsteen, John Lennon. It's a pretty good variety of Christmas music." Fans can find their Christmas fix on the radio at at FM 99.9 or through the station's website, www.KEZ999.com, as well as on iHeartRadio. 1852 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://azc.cc/2fs4w9P More Stories Roberts: Election is over but the ugly oozes on in America Nov. 15, 2016, 4:39 p.m. Kwok: These folks are panicking over Arizona's minimum-wage hike Nov. 15, 2016, 5:40 p.m. Allhands: Chili's manager who took vet's meal isn't the only villain Nov. 15, 2016, 8:04 a.m.

George Strait will return to Las Vegas for a pair of concerts in December, with two more to follow in February. Photo: Ethan Miller /Getty Images For Essential Broadcast Media George Strait fans can live stream concert on Wednesday 1 / 1 Back to Gallery UPDATED George Strait is back in the saddle. The country music superstar will be announcing some upcoming Las Vegas shows and celebrate a new album when he plays a private show near New Braunfels this week. The concert will be live streamed starting at 7 p.m. Wednesday at Strait.WranglerNetwork.com. “Strait Out of The Box: Part 2” comes out Friday. The Walmart exclusive features 56 songs recorded from 1996 to 2016 on three discs, including two new singles. “Going back through all the songs for this box set does bring back a lot of old memories,” Strait said in a statement to the Express-News about selecting the songs. “A lot of them we considered for radio singles and for whatever reason, we just picked something else. It was not that hard to pick them after I looked through them because there are just so many that are my favorites.” Strait is set to perform in Dec. 2-3 and Feb. 17-18 at T-Mobile Arena in Vegas. Tickets are $75 to $200 and are available online from T-Mobile Arena. While Wednesday’s show is absolutely closed to the public, one may get a little surprise if they’re floating the Guadalupe River anywhere near the Gruene water tower and wondering if they’re really hearing King George. Strait famously retired from large-school touring with his Ace in the Hole Band following the “Cowboy Rides Away” tour a few years back. His final San Antonio appearance was June 1, 2013, at the Alamodome, attracting a record 73,086 fans.

Despite the choppy trading, the Dow still reached a new record closing high. The major averages ended the day on opposite sides of the unchanged line. While the Dow crept up 21.03 points or 0.1 percent to 18,868.69, the Nasdaq fell 18.72 points or 0.4 percent to 5,218.40 and the S&P 500 edged down 0.25 points or less than a tenth of a percent to 2,164.20. The choppy trading on Wall Street came as traders seemed reluctant to make more significant moves after the strong gains seen in reaction to President-elect Donald Trump's surprise victory. A lack of major U.S. economic data also kept some traders on the sidelines ahead of the release of several key reports in the coming days. Reports on retail sales, producer and consumer prices, industrial production and housing starts are all due to be released later this week. On the earnings front, retail giants Wal-Mart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), Target (TGT), and Best Buy (BBY) are among the companies due to report their quarterly results this week. Among individual stocks, shares of Harman International (HAR) moved sharply on the day after the automobile technology company agreed to be acquired by Samsung for $8 billion in cash. Mentor Graphics (MENT) also posted a substantial gain after the company agreed to be acquired by Germany's Siemens for $4.5 billion in cash. On the other hand, shares of Novartis (NVS) moved notably lower amid news the drug maker is considering the sale of its Alcon eye care products division Sector News Despite the lack of direction shown by the broader markets, financial stocks added to recent gains amid optimism about reduced regulation under Trump. Reflecting the strength in the financial sector, the Dow Jones Banks Index surged up by 3.4 percent and the NYSE Arca Broker/Dealer Index jumped by 2.3 percent. Steel stocks also saw a substantial move to the upside, continuing to benefit from optimism the industry will benefit from a Trump presidency. The NYSE Arca Steel Index shot up by 2.9 percent to a nearly two-year closing high. Biotechnology, commercial real estate and transportation stocks also saw considerable strength, while significant weakness was visible among internet and software stocks. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance on Monday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index surged up by 1.7 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index slumped by 1.4 percent. Meanwhile, the major European markets all closed modestly higher on the day. While the French CAC 40 Index climbed by 0.4 percent, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index and the German DAX Index edged up by 0.3 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively. In the bond market, treasuries showed a notable move to the downside, extending the sell-off seen in recent sessions. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, jumped by 10.5 basis points to 2.222 percent. Looking Ahead Trading on Tuesday may be impacted by reaction to a batch of economic data, including reports on retail sales, import and export prices and New York manufacturing. Home improvement retailer Home Depot is also scheduled to release its quarterly results before the start of tomorrow's trading. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News The Most Influential Books In Business Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 Forget Canada: The Best Places To Flee Trump's America Previous Story More Top Stories European Shares Seen Extending Gains Snapchat Parent Confidentially Initiates IPO Process All Is Well With ACRS, First Avastin Biosimilar In The Works, CLRB Abuzz Asian Markets In Positive Territory Japanese Market Advances UPS Strike Could Put Wrench In Holiday Shipping Find McRib With Your Phone Stocks Close Mostly Higher Following Upbeat Retail Sales Data - U.S. Commentary Obama's Job Approval Rating Jumps To Four-Year High Americans Optimistic Trump Will Improve The Economy Tech CEO Threatens To Shoot President-Elect Trump Giuliani Reportedly New Favorite To Be Secretary Of State Major Averages Remain Mixed In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Amazon Switching From Wrapping Paper To Reusable Bags <<Previous        60 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Snapchat Parent Confidentially Initiates IPO Process Amazon Switching From Wrapping Paper To Reusable Bags Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances Home Depot Lifts FY EPS View In Line With Market As Q3 Results Top Estimates Vodafone Slips To Pre-Tax Loss On Hefty India Charge; Narrows FY View Merck KgaA Lifts FY16 Earnings View As Q3 Results Climb, Stock Up Crew Members Hurt As Canadian Plane Swerves To Avoid Possible Drone Amaya Gets Huge Buyout Bid From Former CEO Zuckerberg: Facebook Hoax News Did Not Get Trump Elected Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Siemens To Buy Mentor Graphics For $4.5 Bln Enterprise Value AMGN Crosses BRIDGE, Anxiety Over PTCT's Translarna Eases, EGRX Opens Wallet ANTH Plunges As Lupus Trial Fails, BMY's Opdivo Is At It Again, FDA Nod For GILD FDA Snubs DVAX, Keep An Eye On OCUL, It's All Green For BLUE United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Nokia Sets Financial & Strategic Targets; Remains Focused On Cost Saving Program Allianz Stock Climbs On Q3 Profit Growth, Confirms FY16 Profit View Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances Upgrade: Steel Stocks In For Trump Renaissance Nasty Gal Files For Bankruptcy Crew Members Hurt As Canadian Plane Swerves To Avoid Possible Drone Facebook Says Stops Allowing Ads To Target Ethnic Groups Novartis Reportedly Considering Sale Of Alcon Eye Care Division United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars Erickson Says Bankruptcy Court Approves Interim DIP Financing Sumitomo Electric Starts Operation Of CPV Power Generation Plant In Morocco Allianz Group Q3 Profit Climbs; Confirms 2016 Operating Profit Outlook NTT H1 Profit Up, Sales Down; Lifts FY Profit View, Cuts Sales Forecast Bechtle Q3 Profit Rises; Outlook For Year Adjusted Upwards Innogy 9-month Profit Declines; Confirms Forecast - Quick Facts SIG 4-Month Revenues Rise, LFL Revenues Down; CEO Stuart Mitchell Steps Down Konami Q2 Profit Rises, Revenues Down - Quick Facts ANTH Plunges As Lupus Trial Fails, BMY's Opdivo Is At It Again, FDA Nod For GILD Copyright © 2016 RTTNews.

MUMBAI: The Future Group, India's largest retailer, is partnering British wholesaler Booker Group to open cash and carry stores, in a move that will bring it in direct competition with the likes of Walmart India and Metro Cash & Carry. The equal joint venture between Future Consumer (FCL) and UK’s largest wholesaler, plans to open 60-70 stores in three years to sell merchandise to local kirana stores, hotels and catering firms. "Booker India has developed one of the lowest cost distribution networks for FMCG products through its cash and carry network in India," said Kishore Biyani, Vice-Chairman, FCL that sells two dozen products across categories with brands such as Golden Harvest, Tasty Treat, Sunkist, Clean Mate and Care Mate. "We will leverage their expertise in engaging with small, neighborhood retailers and reach out to them with FMCG brands and products developed by our organisation." The JV is part of Biyani's wider strategy to reach Rs 20,000 crore in sales from in-house brands by 2021 and push these higher margins products outside its own 800-odd stores. While Future Group operates around 13 million square feet of retail space with an annual customer footfall of 295 million, it sells own brands to Tata StarBazaar, Metro and Spar. While Booker entered India in 2009, it has not expanded its operations aggressively and now has six stores in Maharashtra and Gujarat. FCL the food and FMCG arm of Future Group, operates retail chains such as KB's Fairprice, Big Apple, Aadhaar & Nilgiri's and also has a food processing facility at Tumkur, Karnataka. On Monday, FCL posted a 27% increase in net sales at Rs438 crore during quarter ended September with net loss of Rs 4 lakh. "Together Booker and Future Group can scale up the business and reach out to a much larger number of retailers and customers in India," Charles Wilson, Chief Executive Office, Booker Group said With at least four players, Walmart, Metro, Bookers and Reliance -operating 92 cash and carry stores, nearly 2.6% of traditional trade in all consumer product goods (CPG) moves through organised wholesale. The Rs 6,800 crore market has been growing at 13%, faster than modern trade, albeit on a lower base. Within the country, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra contribute half the wholesale sales with soft drinks (12%) dominating the channel in terms of value within the CPG space, followed by toilet soaps (9%) and washing powder (8%), according to a Nielsen report last year. The Indian unit of the world's largest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores posted sales of Rs 3996.8 crore for fifteen months ended March 2016 while Metro AG had a turnover of Rs 3,439.9 crore for 2013-14. Future Group also owns Aadhaar, a rural and semi-urban wholesale and distribution format that has 56 franchisees stores with sales of Rs191.74 crore last fiscal.

Gretchen McKay/Post-Gazette Premier Protein Bars are gluten-free. Gretchen McKay/Post-Gazette Lightlife's Meatless Smart Jerky is certified veg and non-GMO. Gretchen McKay/Post-Gazette McCormick's new spice blends includes Italian Seasoning with Flax Seed, Cinnamon & Nutmeg with Chia Seasoning, Citrus Chili & Garlic with Chia Seasoning and Matcha Green Tea with Ginger Seasoning. Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Love your Oreos but you’re looking for something new? Don’t want to give up your beef jerky because you’re now a vegan? Here are some new products that may satisfy a mix of tastes. After being triple-doubled, double-stuffed and thinned, and filled with cinnamon bun, brownie batter and strawberry shortcake flavors, Oreo is going through another reincarnation — it’s joining the candy aisle in the guise of the Milka Oreo Big Crunch Bar and Milka Oreo Chocolate Candy Bar. Both chocolate candy bars taste like, well, an Oreo inside out. Or, almost for a whole nano second. The 10.5-ounce Big Crunch Bar has a thin layer of crunchy Oreo cookie sandwiched between a thin layer of white cream while in the Chocolate Candy Bar (3.5 ounces) cookie pieces dot the cream filling. Both are heavily coated with the Alpine Milka chocolate, and so a rich milk chocolate explodes in the mouth on the first bite. Just as you have an aha moment with the slight crunch of the Oreo cookie, Milka takes over and its milk chocolate lingers from there on. While some Pittsburgh Post-Gazette staffers were giddy over the newfound Oreo/Mika bliss and could not resist popping in piece after piece, some others found their teeth begging them to stop with the sugar madness and the chocolate-cream overload. As an Oreo loyalist, I was disappointed that the cookie got shortchanged and would have liked to have more of it in the candy bar.  The one thing we could all agree upon was that it would be one gooey mess if the candy bars, made by Nabisco’s division of Mondelez International, were to be twisted or dunked in a glass of cold milk. The Big Crunch Bar is $4.99 and is available starting today at select retailers such as Wal-Mart, while the Chocolate Candy Bar won’t be available until January and costs $1.79.  — Arthi Subramaniam Protein bars can be a godsend for one-the-go athletes and others hungry for a nutritional supplement that provides high-quality protein and other nutrients. But what if you’re sensitive to gluten? You might want to try Premier Protein, which this month is launching a line of gluten-free bars. Made without artificial flavors, colors or sweeteners, each of the seven flavors serves up 30 grams of protein, 3 grams of fiber and 10 percent of the calcium. At $1.99 each, they’re not cheap, but they’d hit the spot after a workout. We tried the hard-to-resist Dark Chocolate Almond, and thought it wasn’t bad, if a bit dense — not too chocolaty, with a hint of vanilla. Available at select grocery and club stores, including Costco, Sam’s Club and Wal-Mart.  —  Gretchen McKay Vegan-friendly Smart Jerky is the latest addition to Lightlife’s family of protein-packed, plant-based foods. The original flavor has a light smoky taste, similar to the brand’s “fakin’ bacon” tempeh strips. There’s also a teriyaki option, which has a little extra kick to it. Both have a nice tough-yet-not-too-chewy texture. More good news: it’s non-GMO Project verified, free of cholesterol and trans fats and is less than 100 calories per package. Smart Jerky retails for $4.99 at select Whole Foods and Stop and Shop locations. Visit www.lightlife.com for recipe ideas and more plant-based protein products. — Sara Bauknecht  McCormick is planting a new seed in its gourmet organic line. It’s packing seasonings with super seeds such as black chia seed and flaxseed. The spice company also is unveiling a Matcha Green Tea with Ginger Seasoning for devotees of the powdered tea who crave for a boost in their smoothies or pestos. So if you are making Italian-style pork chops, marinate the meat in a mix of olive oil, white wine, Italian Seasoning with Flaxseed, minced garlic for about an hour before grilling it over medium-high. Or make chicken enchiladas with a generous sprinkle of Citrus Chili & Garlic with Chia Seasoning. And for Thanksgiving, substitute cinnamon with the Cinnamon & Nutmeg with Chia Seasoning in your sweet potato or pumpkin pie. Distinctive flavors stand out in each of the seasonings, and, no, you don’t taste the super seeds. — Arthi Subramaniam Arthi Subramaniam: asubramaniam@post-gazette.com, 412-263-1494 or on Twitter @arthisub.; Gretchen McKay: gmckay@post-gazette.com, 412-263-1419 or on Twitter @gtmckay.; Sara Bauknecht: sbauknecht@post-gazette.com or on Twitter and Instagram @SaraB_PG.

By Sean Portnoy for Laptops & Desktops | November 4, 2016 -- 01:00 GMT (18:00 PDT) | Topic: PCs The Black Friday ad for Sam's Club features laptops and desktops from HP exclusively. With November finally here, the Black Friday ad leaks have begun trickling in. Following both Dell's home and small business ad disclosures, Walmart's warehouse arm Sam's Club has its 12-page ad see the light of daily early as well. Black Friday 2016 CNET 2016 Holiday Gift Guide Microsoft preview promises deals on Surface devices, Windows laptops Hhgregg ad has 12.9-inch iPad Pro deal Office Depot/OfficeMax ad features $119 Windows 2-in-1 tablet, $169 HP laptop Best Buy ad reveals $100 Windows laptop deal, $125 iPad Air 2, Pro savings Walmart ad features $199 Apple iPad mini 2, $119 Chromebook deals Target ad has iPad Pro for $449, iPad Air 2 for $274 HP ad leaks with PC deals from $250 Staples ad leaks with laptops, tablet deals Costco ad leaks with laptop, desktop, tablet deals Ads for Dell Small Business leak BJ's Wholesale ad features $33.33 Amazon Fire tablet Sam's Club ad leaks with HP laptop, desktop deals Dell's ad leaks with $100 laptop, desktop deals In a far cry from the recent past, the ad has but a single tablet special in the form of a 10.1-inch Samsung Galaxy Tab A for $188.44, which is not only about $80 off the current price, but includes a 32GB microSD for additional storage needs. Long gone are the days when Sam's Club included an iPad as a Black Friday special -- there's no Apple product in sight in the ad. Instead, the other computing devices highlighted are all HP systems: a desktop and a trio of laptops. The desktop is a bundle of a Pavilion tower with 24-inch monitor, with a significant discount of $250 off the everyday price of $729. The PC includes an Intel Core i5 processor, 12 gigs of RAM, and a 2TB hard drive, while the display has full HD resolution. The notebook deals start with the 15-BA067CL, which the ad claims is regularly priced at $449, but which is currently priced at $399 on the Sam's Club website. The Black Friday price of $299 is still $100 cheaper, and you get a choice of blue, teal, or red case color to go with an AMD A10-9600 processor, 8GB of memory, terabyte hard drive, and 15.6-inch display. For $30 more, you can grab the 17-x027cl, which comes with an Intel Core i3-5005U CPU, 6GB of RAM, 1TB hard drive, and 17.3-inch screen for $170 less than the regular price. Rounding things out is the beefier HP 15-ay137cl with Core i7-7500U processor, 16 gigs of RAM, and terabyte hard drive for $499, or a whopping $250 less than the current price.

The investment fund that finances recycling infrastructure and technologies announced its $1.5 million investment in Lakeshore Recycling Systems in March, bringing a high-tech material recovery facility to Chicago. The Closed Loop Fund has amassed millions of dollars from leading companies including 3M, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Walmart and it invests in the form of low-interest loans to companies and zero-interest loans to cities. Its goal is to invest more than $500 million in US recycling projects by 2020. According to its first public progress report, released today, the fund has invested nearly $20 million in nine projects to date, and this has generated more than $50 million in co-investment from municipalities, banks and impact investors. The report says investing in the recycling industry yields environmental and financial returns for cities, companies and private investors, despite low commodities prices. “We are seeing municipalities and private companies — especially those with integrated models — generate savings, revenues, and profit as a result of improving recycling infrastructure,” said Closed Loop Partners managing partner Ron Gonen. “And so far, each investment is paying back as expected.” Since the fund first opened its application process for US corporations and municipalities in October 2014, it has received more than 150 inquiries for more than $350 million in financing, the report says. Four of its “live” projects have already diverted about 50,000 tons of material, avoiding the equivalent of 112,000 metric tons of GHG emissions. In addition to the Lakeshore Recycling System investment, the Closed Loop Fund has invested a total of $24 million in three other projects that are already online. These include a joint venture between QRS and Canusa-Hershman to create a one-of-a-kind plastic recovery facility in Baltimore, Maryland that recycles the #3-#7 hard–to–recycle plastics such as yogurt containers and lawn furniture. The two other investments, made last year, are in Quad Cities, Iowa, and Portage County, Ohio, allowing both communities to convert from dual-stream recycling systems to single-stream, making it easier for citizens to recycle. While its latest investment isn’t live yet, in September the fund awarded about $150,000 each to two plastic film recyclers, Zzyzx (pronounced “ziziks”) and Drought Diet Products. In addition to helping the private companies in which it invests generate profit, the Closed Loop Fund says its loans have also produced about $250,000 in economic benefits to municipalities. Gonen says the fund is committing 20 percent of its capital to develop robust end markets to ensure the system economics work. “You can expect to see several end market investment announcements from us in 2017,” Gonen said. “We have some great business models in our pipeline that will maintain value across a range of commodities. Stay tuned.” Closed Loop Fund Investment Supports Single-Stream Recycling in Memphis Mars Drinks’ Single Serve Packaging Redesign Cuts Carbon Footprint by 31% Lakeshore Recycling Systems Receives $1.5M Closed Loop Fund Investment Recycling ‘Game Changer’ Gets $24M Cash Injection Keurig Transitioning to Recylable K-Cups Reader Comments There are no comments for this story.   Name (required) Mail (will not be published) (required) Website Energy Manager News Solar Financing Options Evolve 18 Companies Ask VA for Regulatory Clarification California PUC Changes Rules for Rent-Subsidized Apartments In Homer, Alaska, Decision on Deregulation Will Be Divulged in December CPS Energy Pledges That Customers Will Not Cover Costs of New $122M Headquarters Hospitals Should Use the Internet of Things – But Very Carefully University of Arkansas Launches Initiatives at 2 Campuses Revolution Lighting Announces Wins NEWSLETTER SIGNUP Join 100,000+ subscribers who gain a competitive advantage with our news and analysis.

Aldi grocery to open two Delaware stores Thursday Scott Goss , The News Journal 8:28 a.m. EST November 15, 2016 About 90 percent of the items sold by Aldi are private-label, store-brand products. (Photo: SUBMITTED PHOTO) 529 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Discount grocer Aldi will make its Delaware debut Thursday – not once, but twice. The German-based supermarket chain is set to open new stores in Middletown and Camden simultaneously with public ribbon cuttings planned for 8:45 a.m. The first 100 shoppers at each store will be rewarded for their commitment with golden tickets, each containing an Aldi gift card of varying amounts up to $100. Customers also will be able to enter a sweepstake for a year's supply of Aldi produce. The supermarket's new locations in southern New Castle and central Kent counties are the chain's first in Delaware. Aldi currently operates nearly 1,600 stores in 34 states, including a store off U.S. 40, just over the state line in Elkton, Maryland. "We are pleased to bring our first stores to Delaware to help customers get high-quality products at everyday low prices," Aldi vice president Bob Grammer said in a release. STORY: Delaware's secret place in Wawa history STORY: Lane Bryant, Talbots, Chili's and others coming to Christiana Aldi will offer a different grocery store experience for many Delaware shoppers. The chain is perhaps best known for its no-frills approach, which includes selling its own private-label brand in place of familiar products such as Jiffy, Betty Crocker or Nabisco. Some major brand-name products are offered as a "special purchase," meaning reduced price. Aldi-brand products, meanwhile, are typically priced about 30- to 50-percent less than their better-known competitors. As a result, stores do not accept manufacturers' coupons. Aldi also encourages customers to bring their own bags or face a 6-cent charge for paper and 10-cent charge plastic to use theirs. Customers also are expected to bag up their own groceries. Grocery carts, meanwhile, are only accessible by paying a 25 cent deposit, returned to the customer at the end of their shopping trip. Aldi sells meat, dairy and perishable goods like most grocery stores, but has no deli or bakery departments. And while most grocery store chains are adopting a bigger-is-better approach, Aldi stores are relatively compact – a feature company officials say makes the markets simpler to navigate. The Middletown store at 1002 Bunker Hill Road – better known as the southwest corner of Bunker Hill Road and U.S. 301 – and the Camden store in the Camden Town Center shopping center at 390 Walmart Drive are both slightly less than 18,000 square feet. By comparison, about 10 of those Aldis could fit inside the Walmarts near each location. The limited space means Aldi's product lines tends to be focused on basic, weekly staples. While the chain does not to compete on variety, it has been staking a claim in the growing healthier food market. That includes more organic meat and produce, more gluten-free products and other items made without pesticides or additives, such as synthetic colors, partially hydrogenated oils and added MSG. Each of the stores will employ about 20 workers. Company officials declined to discuss starting pay, expected to say Aldi has "a strong track record of paying our employees market-leading wages." Staff working at least 25 hours per week also will receive health insurance benefits and dental converage, while all employees are allowed to particiate in a 401(k) retirement savings plan. But Aldi won't be the only German-based supermarket chain in Delaware for long. Lidl is working aggressively to follow its chief European competitor into the U.S. market, with plans to open its first 150 stores on this side of the Atlantic by 2018. That no-frills discount grocery chain recently opened its U.S. headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, and announced plans this summer to establish a $100 million regional headquarters and distribution center in Perryville, Maryland.  (Photo: PROVIDED) "Right now, we are early along in our U.S. expansion and have not yet set individual opening dates for any Lidl U.S. stores," Lidl spokesman Will Harwood said Monday. "However, I can tell you that we are actively preparing a number of sites in the area as we expand." Lidl already has started construction on a 36,000-square-foot store next to the new Grotto Pizza off U.S. 301 in Middletown. Earlier this year, the chain also won conditional approval from Dover's planning commission to build a new store off U.S. 13 and is under contract to purchase a 17.5-acre property in Ogletown that is now home to Vince's Sports Center. The race between Aldi and Lidl to expand across the country could spell trouble for a U.S. grocery store market beset by contraction and consolidation in recent years. The two chains have rapidly spread across Great Britain since 2012, forcing major supermarket chains to slash prices – and profits – in an effort to keep up. "We challenge shoppers to switch from national brands to our high-quality, exclusive brands and stretch their dollars without compromising quality," Aldi's Grammer said. "As important as price is, the only way to attract and keep shoppers is to have quality products."

Pearl St. (Courtesy of Trisha Anderson) Print Email Ryan Kryska | rkryska@mlive.com By Ryan Kryska | rkryska@mlive.com The Jackson Citizen Patriot on November 14, 2016 at 12:00 PM, updated November 14, 2016 at 12:01 PM comments JACKSON, MI -- Two new lieutenants are settled in as the Salvation Army leaders in Jackson. Ross and Trisha Anderson started in July, but now are gearing up for the Red Kettle Campaign, which starts Wednesday, Nov. 16. Listen for the bell-ringers at 26 locations in Jackson County, including the Jackson Post Office, 113 W. Michigan Ave., Jackson Crossing, 1092 Jackson Crossing, and Walmart, 1700 W. Michigan Ave. "The territorial headquarters makes the decision on where the lieutenants go," Ross Anderson said. "We love the people around here." The Andersons spent a few years in Chicago training for this opportunity to lead a community Salvation Army. "We did training, biblical studies, lots of business classes, social working classes, how to run a nonprofit," Ross Anderson said. "We'll be continuing to learn for the next five years on handling donors through Nazarene University." The Andersons, both from Minnesota, are finding the transition to Jackson an easy one, they said. "We love Jackson, we both come from small towns, so Chicago was kind of out of our environment," Ross Anderson said. "This is a great middle ground for us." Under their leadership, the Salvation Army of Jackson is concentrating on youth activities for low-income families, Ross Anderson said. The food shelf and partnership with Toys for Tots are other big points of emphasis, he said. Their goal right now is taking in Christmas assistance items to hand out as holiday baskets, Trisha Anderson said. "It's been busy," she said. "The community has really embraced us." To donate to the Salvation Army's local efforts, call 517-782-7185.

Advisor Insights Newsletters Site Log In Advisor Insights Log In The Week Ahead: November 14-18, 2016 (TGT, WMT) By Aaron Hankin | November 13, 2016 — 3:21 PM EST In the early morning hours of November 9th after the election had been called for Donald Trump, markets around the world fell. At one point the Dow Jones Futures were down by 800 points. The initial sell-off in stocks and flight to quality dwindled and sentiment turned with all major indices closing higher on Wednesday. The final days of the week saw divergence in the equity markets with the Dow Jones Industrial Average making an all-time high led by infrastructure firms, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 lagged as the outlook for tech companies under a Trump government fell. It's a busy week ahead in the U.S. where the transition from the administration of President Obama to President-elect Donald Trump continues, Fed Chair Janet Yellen speaks, and a handful of U.S. economic numbers are released. The earnings calendar is winding down but some large retailers will report third-quarter earnings this coming week. They include Target Corp. (TGT), The Home Depot Inc. (HD), Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) and Best Buy Co Inc. (BBY). Election fallout On Thursday, Trump will meet with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe in New York. Throughout Trump's campaign, he has repeatedly said he will withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, something that Obama signed with Japan and 10 other countries in 2016. Trump will likely extend an olive branch to Abe as he looks for a close ally in Asia as the tensions with both China and North Korea continue to escalate. Other presidential issues that may arise this week include Trump's plan for Obamacare, the make-up of his cabinet and clarification regarding his stance on Dodd-Frank. (See also: Trump Vows to 'Dismantle' Dodd-Frank.) Yellen Janet Yellen is due to testify to the Senate’s Joint Economic Committee on Thursday. The ongoing rate hike debate continues to keep markets on edge. Prior to the election, the probability of a December rate hike was 82 percent, which was cut in half when Trump won the election. However, ensuing calm in financial markets has seen the probability go back to 80 percent, accord to the CME FedWatch data. Yellen is not expected to be quizzed on the election, but the Trump victory has cast a shadow over her future at the Federal Reserve beyond 2018, when her term is up. (See also: December Rate Hike Remains Intact After Trump Win.) With the fallout from the election continuing, economic data has taken a back seat. However, we will get more indication of the state of the U.S. economy with the October retail sales report released on Tuesday, and the latest inflation numbers on Thursday. Retail sales are expected to have grown 0.6 percent in the month on October and inflation is expected to have ticked up to 0.4 percent from 0.3 percent in the prior month. Offshore In Europe, there is a slew of economic data out this coming week. In the U.K., retail sales, inflation, unemployment and industrial production will be released throughout the week. Along with the full data calendar, Bank of England governor, Mark Carney is due to speak to Parliament’s Treasury Committee where he will likely field questions on his decision to extend his term at the BoE for a further year as the U.K. transitions through Brexit. Elsewhere, German and eurozone GDP will be closely watched after the EUR took a dive last week, making an 8-month low of 1.1830 against the U.S. dollar.

Posted: Monday, November 14, 2016 Biggby, Culver’s may be coming to Greenville By Cory Smith • Last Updated 10:26 am on Monday, November 14, 2016 Tweet Steve Witty, a civil engineer with Nederveld Inc., presents the site plan during Thursday evening’s Greenville Planning Commission meeting for a new commercial building that would feature space for four new tenants. — Daily News/Cory Smith GREENVILLE — As the finishing touches are being placed on the soon-to-open Murphy Oil gas station, plans are in the works to add yet another commercial neighbor on the west end of town. During Thursday evening’s Greenville Planning Commission meeting, the commission reviewed a site plan for a commercial building that would be located at 10990 W. Carson City Road (M-57), a 1-acre piece of property on the northeast corner of M-57 and Satterlee Roads in front of Walmart and directly west of Murphy Oil. The proposal comes forth from Mike Brann Jr., owner of the Brann’s Steakhouse & Sports Grille restaurant chain, who hopes the building, designed for four tenants with drive-through service offered for the west and east tenants, will bring four new businesses to town. “The Greenville community, we really like coming here for the Gus Macker tournament, and I love the (commercial) strip,” Brann said. “Starbucks used to be on the other side of the road, and that’s why this is so important to us, we want it to be convenient.” If approved, Brann said one business has already signed on as a tenant: Biggby Coffee. Brann said he and his father, Mike Brann Sr., are also in talks to bring a Culver’s Restaurant to the new commercial building. “We’re planning, there will probably be a Culver’s in town at some point, but Biggby is 100 percent,” Brann Jr. said. Members of the Greenville Planning Commission review a site plan Thursday for a new commercial building that would feature space for four new tenants and be located on the northeast corner of the intersection of Satterlee Road and M-57. According to civil engineer Steve Witty of Nederveld Inc., who presented the plan to the Planning Commission, the plan requires a special land-use request as to the unique nature of the design of the 6,020 square-foot commercial building containing two drive-through locations, as well as 62 parking spaces. Under the current designs, entrances would feature a “full service” drive off of Satterlee and a “right in” only driveway off of M-57, meaning traffic could not exit onto M-57. Witty said discussions are still ongoing with the Road Commission for Montcalm County and Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) to receive approval for both entrances. In addition to the site plan, two variances involving parking setback and a “green belt” around the property would also need to be approved by the Zoning Board of Appeals, due to the fact that the building is located further north on the property to accommodate a required “clear vision” area at the intersection of Satterlee and M-57. That situation forces the parking spaces to abut against the north property line, but according to city ordinances, a five-foot “green spaces” is needed at the edge of the property. Greenville City Manager George Bosanic said in order to approve the variances, proof of hardship must be met, which in this case is demonstrated by the required “clear vision” area mandated by MDOT. In reviewing the site plan, the commission voted unanimously to schedule a public hearing on Dec. 8 to continue the review, as long as landscaping and elevation plans are submitted in a timely manner. “It looks like you are well on course,” Planning Commission Chairman David Ralph said. “We appreciate you coming in today to share the plan with us.”   About the Author Cory Smith Cory is the Greenville beat reporter for The Daily News.

Reply Like or Dislike: 0  0 Micki R Stoneking November 15, 2016 at 12:42 am It’s good that businesses are coming in but how about using empty buildings and updating them. That corner lot on 57 and scatterlee is already too busy with traffic. We could use carvers on the main drag of 91. Would be great during Gus macker and the festival. The urban sprawl is very noticeable in town and this need to be fixed. They need to look at all of Greenville and fill the holes with new businesses, then build more buildings if we need to accommodate them.

Scott Levine (scott81236) Nov 14, 2016 at 11:21AM When Donald Trump first announced his intention to run for president, few believed he could win. Another contender -- fuel-cell technology -- has also inspired little hope that it has a legitimate chance of winning a place in America's energy landscape. But there's always room for one more underdog story. Could Donald Trump's success help effect a similar victory for fuel-cell stocks?  Image source: Getty Images. What we know Although he didn't thoroughly address it in the debates, Trump has repeatedly emphasized his rejection -- actually calling it a "hoax" -- of climate change during his campaign. How would this view manifest itself during his time in office? For one, he has announced his intention to reject President Obama's Clean Power Plan, which seeks to reduce carbon emissions from power plants. A lot is said before Election Day, and what one says during a campaign and what one does after an election are quite different, so let's look beyond the rhetoric. In one of his recent moves, President-elect Trump chose Myron Ebell, a known climate-change skeptic, to lead the EPA transition team. Some people are speculating that Trump will also select Ebell to lead the EPA following the inauguration. Whether Trump selects Ebell or someone similar, it certainly appears as if the implementation of the Clean Power Plan -- currently stalled pending judicial review -- is in jeopardy.  What to expect Still in its infancy, the fuel-cell industry has failed to keep pace with the rapidly growing acceptance that the solar and wind industries have enjoyed. Although Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) and FuelCell Energy (NASDAQ:FCEL), the two leading fuel-cell companies, have provided their products and services to some of the biggest names in business -- including Wal-Mart, The Home Depot, and FedEx -- their revenues are still meager. For fiscal 2015, Plug Power reported revenue of $103.3 million, and FuelCell Energy reported $163.1 million. To accelerate their growth trajectories, both companies recognize that the extension of the investment tax credit (ITCs) for the fuel-cell industry is imperative. Absent from legislation that extended tax credits for the solar and wind industries, the fuel-cell industry's extension is expected to be renewed during the lame-duck session of Congress, according to the managements of both companies. With the turnover taking place in Washington, though, the renewal of the fuel-cell ITC is not likely to be at the top of any current legislator's agenda, nor does it seem likely once the new Congress convenes. And it certainly won't receive any support from Trump once he moves into the Oval Office. He has made clear that a Trump administration "will not be in the business of government picking winners and losers." What else to expect Should President-elect Trump succeed in dismissing the Clean Power Plan, it would shatter the aspirations of FuelCell Energy, which is working to capitalize on carbon capture. The company has partnered with ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) to pursue fuel-driven carbon-capture technology. Having recently selected the site of a pilot project, the company will conduct tests to demonstrate carbon capture from both natural gas-fired power generation and coal-fired power generation. Unlike FuelCell Energy, Plug Power is focused on the material handling equipment market, so the rejection of the Clean Power Plan would have a less material impact on its business. However, the absence of the ITC extension would still be devastating. Image source: Plug Power corporate website. One likely response for Plug Power is a doubling down on its attention to China. On the company's third-quarter conference call, Andy Marsh, Plug Power's CEO, identified China as a "a major long-term market opportunity." Assuming the ITC is not extended, the company may shift its perspective, recognizing the country instead as a short-term priority -- especially since Marsh claims that Plug Power "can enter the market with a technology and cost structure advantage that's not matched by anyone else." The takeaway Having encountered many fits and starts during the climate friendly Obama presidency, fuel-cell stocks will face more of the same during the Trump presidency. Before the election, investors of fuel-cell stocks had surely recognized the need for a long-term horizon. Now, more than ever, they will need to remind themselves of this, for it's bound to be a rocky road for the fuel-cell industry in the years ahead.

Minyanville Q4 '16 Earnings Now Less Important - Next 12 Months Could be more About P/E Expansion By Scutify Nov 13, 2016 8:32 am PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. Per Thomson Reuters, with 455 of the SP 500 having already reported their Q3 '16 financial results, SP 500 earnings have grown 4.1% year-over-year, while excluding Energy, the SP 500 earnings have grown +7.7%. This is pretty good earnings growth - well above what the Street was expecting. On October 2nd, readers of this blog were told to expect this, but actual results have been slightly stronger for Q3 '16, with the bigger retailers expected to report this week. The 3rd quarter, 2016 earnings season will unofficially end with Walmart's earnings release scheduled for this coming Thursday morning, November 17th, before the market open. Here is the thing though: as readers could tell from the market action this week - actual earnings reports for Q4 '16 - take on much less importance than the fiscal policy and Republican reform agenda that will surely follow in the next 90 - 100 days. The SP 500 ended 2014 - 12/31/14 - at 2,059. The SP 500 closed on Friday, November 11th at 2,164, for a 5% increase over a 23 month time frame. The SP 500 has essentially been flat, trading around the "2,000" print going on two years now. The point of this lesson being that with the collapse in crude oil and the Energy sector, SP 500 earnings have been flat for 2 years, and if we exclude Energy, SP 500 earnings have grown about 4% - 5% over the last 2 years, pretty much inline with the return on the SP 500. In other words, the SP 500 has pretty much walked up the chart with the degree of "Ex-Energy" earnings growth. There has been little P/E expansion, and on occasion, P/E contraction. That could change now: without getting into the politics of the last election, the Republican's are likely to follow their typical, "pro-business" agenda, which COULD mean corporate tax reform, a lowering of individual tax rates for all Americans, and the already-commented upon reform of Dodd-Frank, and the Affordable Care Act. We saw some knee-jerk reactions last week in the Sp 500 with Financials and Industrials now dramatically overbought (per the Bespoke Report). Biotech has its best week ever - and the thing is NONE of this is earnings-related, yet. I do think we are entering a period over the next 90 - 180 days that will be more "macro" over "micro" (i.e. individual company-driven) and that makes investing much harder for stock pickers. Sector ETF's and the various indices might be better investment vehicles over the next 3 - 6 months to play specific macro themes (less regulation, Financials, auto's, or less government support i.e. Solar, and the potential loss of the tax credits, etc.) The point of all this is that I will continue to update the SP 500 earnings data every week, but I do think watching nuanced changes in sector growth will be less telling in the near term. Watch that "forward 4-quarter estimate" though - this metric will take on more importance after the results of Tuesday night, November 8th, 2016. --------- Thomson Reuters data by the numbers: Forward 4-quarter estimate: $128.43 vs last week's $128.56 - the forward estimate remains rather stable which is a plus for forward earnings expectations P.E ratio: 16.85(x) PEG ratio: 4.5(x) SP 500 earnings yield: 5.93% vs last week's 6.05% Year-over-year growth of forward estimate: +3.69% vs last week's 3.59%. Analysis / conclusion: with the SP 500 being a discounting mechanism, the benchmark should be out in front of any "macro" policy changes, meaning tax and regulation reform. A lot is going to change over the next 6 months, particularly from a business environment perspective, and much of the Washington agenda should be "pro-economic-growth" which should translate into faster SP 500 earnings growth. Investors got a look at the potential big winners this week, in terms of Financials and Health Care. The Technology trade this week was puzzling but somewhat understandable. Any popular trade the last few years like the "safety" trade (Ute's and dividends) or the investment-grade bond fund trade, or the "yield" trade (corporate high yield (up to a point), bank loans, etc. are to be avoided. Here is a blog post from August 27th, 2016 that looks pretty good 10 weeks later. Thanks for reading. This article was written by Brian Gilmartin for Trinity Asset Management on Nov 12, 2016.

The evening begins with fellowship and live music at Hilltop Baptist Church and continues by van to Burnhead Grazings, where the drama will begin. Actors portraying Mary, the Angel Gabriel, Joseph and Elizabeth will act out four different scenes. Organizers make use of the animals at Burnhead for the production. The timing of the Nativity drama is coordinated to get people thinking about the real reason for the season and to avoid competing with other holiday festivities, according to Moire Bridges, who runs the business at Burnhead with husband Randy. An offering will be received, benefiting the LifeWay Pregnancy Center. Last year, the event raised about $1,200, said Bridges, who pointed out the tie-in to the importance of Mary’s unplanned pregnancy. Seating is limited. Reservations are recommended but not required by calling Hilltop Baptist Church at (724) 349-9180 or Burnhead Grazings at (724) 422-5394. PHOTO: Actors portrayed a scene during last year's event.

Despite the choppy trading, the Dow managed to reach a new record intraday high. Currently, the major averages are turning in a mixed performance. While the Nasdaq is down 6.45 points or 0.1 percent at 5,230.66, the Dow is up 41.95 points or 0.2 percent at 18,889.61 and the S&P 500 is up 2.30 points or 0.1 percent at 2,166.75. The choppy trading on Wall Street comes as traders seem reluctant to make more significant moves after the strong gains seen in reaction to President-elect Donald Trump's surprise victory. A lack of major U.S. economic data may also be keeping some traders on the sidelines ahead of the release of several key reports in the coming days. Reports on retail sales, producer and consumer prices, industrial production and housing starts are all due to be released later this week. On the earnings front, retail giants Wal-Mart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), Target (TGT), and Best Buy (BBY) are among the companies due to report their quarterly results this week. Despite the lack of direction being shown by the broader markets, financial stocks are adding to recent gains amid optimism about reduced regulation under Trump. Reflecting the strength in the financial sector, the Dow Jones Banks Index is up by 3.3 percent and the NYSE Arca Broker/Dealer Index is up by 2.7 percent. Transportation, steel, and electronic storage stocks are also seeing significant strength, while gold and utilities stocks have moved notably lower. In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance on Monday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index surged up by 1.7 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index slumped by 1.4 percent. Meanwhile, the major European markets have all moved to the upside on the day. While the French CAC 40 Index has advanced by 0.7 percent, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index and the German DAX Index are both up by 0.6 percent. In the bond market, treasuries are extending the sell-off seen over the past few sessions. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is up by 12.5 basis points at 2.242 percent. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com The Most Influential Books In Business Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 Forget Canada: The Best Places To Flee Trump's America Previous Story More Commentary -Global European Shares Seen Extending Gains Sensex, Nifty Pare Early Gains Asian Markets In Positive Territory Sensex, Nifty Seeking Rebound After Selloff Higher Open Called For Thai Stock Market Indonesia Stock Market May Snap Losing Streak Additional Support Expected For Hong Kong Shares Renewed Support Tipped For China Bourse Taiwan Stock Market May Snap Losing Streak Singapore Bourse Likely To Crack Resistance At 2,800 Points Malaysia Market May Extend Tuesday's Gains South Korea Shares May Find Traction On Wednesday Stocks Close Mostly Higher Following Upbeat Retail Sales Data - U.S. Commentary Major Averages Remain Mixed In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary European Markets Finish Mostly Higher, But Little Changed Overall <<Previous        57 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Snapchat Parent Confidentially Initiates IPO Process Amazon Switching From Wrapping Paper To Reusable Bags Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances Home Depot Lifts FY EPS View In Line With Market As Q3 Results Top Estimates Vodafone Slips To Pre-Tax Loss On Hefty India Charge; Narrows FY View Merck KgaA Lifts FY16 Earnings View As Q3 Results Climb, Stock Up Crew Members Hurt As Canadian Plane Swerves To Avoid Possible Drone Amaya Gets Huge Buyout Bid From Former CEO Zuckerberg: Facebook Hoax News Did Not Get Trump Elected Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Siemens To Buy Mentor Graphics For $4.5 Bln Enterprise Value AMGN Crosses BRIDGE, Anxiety Over PTCT's Translarna Eases, EGRX Opens Wallet ANTH Plunges As Lupus Trial Fails, BMY's Opdivo Is At It Again, FDA Nod For GILD FDA Snubs DVAX, Keep An Eye On OCUL, It's All Green For BLUE United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Nokia Sets Financial & Strategic Targets; Remains Focused On Cost Saving Program Allianz Stock Climbs On Q3 Profit Growth, Confirms FY16 Profit View Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances Upgrade: Steel Stocks In For Trump Renaissance Nasty Gal Files For Bankruptcy Crew Members Hurt As Canadian Plane Swerves To Avoid Possible Drone Facebook Says Stops Allowing Ads To Target Ethnic Groups Novartis Reportedly Considering Sale Of Alcon Eye Care Division United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars Erickson Says Bankruptcy Court Approves Interim DIP Financing Sumitomo Electric Starts Operation Of CPV Power Generation Plant In Morocco Allianz Group Q3 Profit Climbs; Confirms 2016 Operating Profit Outlook NTT H1 Profit Up, Sales Down; Lifts FY Profit View, Cuts Sales Forecast Bechtle Q3 Profit Rises; Outlook For Year Adjusted Upwards Innogy 9-month Profit Declines; Confirms Forecast - Quick Facts SIG 4-Month Revenues Rise, LFL Revenues Down; CEO Stuart Mitchell Steps Down Konami Q2 Profit Rises, Revenues Down - Quick Facts ANTH Plunges As Lupus Trial Fails, BMY's Opdivo Is At It Again, FDA Nod For GILD Copyright © 2016 RTTNews.

MUMBAI: India's largest retailer Future Group is partnering British wholesaler Booker Group to open cash and carry stores and directly compete with Walmart and Metro in the country. The equal joint venture between Future Consumer Ltd (FCL) and UK's largest wholesaler, plans to open about 60-70 stores in the next three years to sell merchandise to local kirana stores, hotels and catering firms. “Booker India has developed one of the lowest cost distribution networks for FMCG products through its cash and carry network in India,” said Kishore Biyani, Vice-Chairman, FCL that sell two dozen products across categories with brands such as Golden Harvest, Tasty Treat, Sunkist, Clean Mate and Care Mate. "We will leverage their expertise in engaging with small, neighborhood retailers and reach out to them with the FMCG brands and products being developed by our organization.” The JV is part of Biyani's wider strategy to reach Rs 20,000 crore in sales from in-house brands by 2021 and push these higher margins products outside its own 800-odd stores. While Future Group operates around 13 million square feet of retail space with an annual customer footfall of 295 million, it sells own brands to Tata StarBazaar, Metro and Spar. While Booker entered India in 2009, it has not expanded its operations aggressively and now has six stores in Maharashtra and Gujarat. FCL the food and FMCG arm of Future Group, operates retail chains such as KB’s Fairprice, Big Apple, Aadhaar & Nilgiri’s and also has a food processing facility at Tumkur, Karnataka. On Monday, FCL posted a 27% increase in net sales at Rs438 crore during quarter ended September with net loss of Rs 4 lakh. "Together Booker and Future Group can scale up the business and reach out to a much larger number of retailers and customers in India," Charles Wilson, Chief Executive Office, Booker Group said. With at least four players, Walmart, Metro, Bookers and Reliance -operating 92 cash and carry stores, nearly 2.6% of traditional trade in all consumer product goods (CPG) moves through organised wholesale. The Rs 6,800 crore market has been growing at 13%, faster than modern trade, albeit on a lower base. Within the country, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra contribute half the wholesale sales with soft drinks (12%) dominating the channel in terms of value within the CPG space, followed by toilet soaps (9%) and washing powder (8%), according to a Nielsen report last year. The Indian unit of the world's largest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores posted sales of Rs 3996.8 crore for fifteen months ended March 2016 while Metro AG had a turnover of Rs 3,439.9 crore for 2013-14. Future Group also owns Aadhaar, a rural and semi-urban wholesale and distribution format that has 30 franchisees stores with sales of Rs191.74 crore last fiscal.

The World Chess Championship is underway in New York. ((CHRIS YURKO / HOLYOKE COMMUNITY COLLEGE)) Print Email Ron Chimelis | rchimelis@repub.com By Ron Chimelis | rchimelis@repub.com masslive.com Email the author on November 14, 2016 at 9:00 AM, updated November 14, 2016 at 2:36 PM comments My journey into the world of the delightfully bizarre began outside Fulton's Market in Manhattan, where lucky ticket-holders awaited entry to the World Championship of Chess. Inside was Magnus Carlsen, a Norwegian recognized as best player of all time - which is a long time in chess, whose history can be traced back 1,500 years ago and might date to ancient times. His opponent was the Russian, Sergey Karjakin, and Game 2 of a 12-game match for the title was coming up next. A passerby passed by. "What's everybody out here waiting for?" he asked, treating this epic event the way one would treat a crowd awaiting the start of a sale at Walmart. There were clues: men and women of all ages playing chess at nearby tables, and a display detailing New York's proud history in the sport. Still, I've attended World Series games at Fenway Park and Wrigley Field, and no one ever asked me why a crowd was assembling outside. The World Chess Championship might not seem like big stuff to you. Many of you probably even laugh at it, but for those of us who love the sport (that's twice I've called chess a "sport" - yes, it is) the championship has a Mount Sinai quality attached to it. Those of us who love chess felt fortunate to fork over $75 to watch two men in their mid-20s peer motionlessly over a board, trying to anticipate several moves ahead. Nonbelievers say comparing that to paint drying does a disservice to paint. They don't get it. It's not so much about what we see, but what we try to anticipate. Pretending we can keep up with the grandmasters, we plot what they might do next. This makes chess a simultaneously participatory and spectator endeavor, sort of how Red Sox fans react when John Farrell goes to the bullpen, only quieter and less profane. Carlsen, 25, is our hope to bring chess back into the mainstream, where it hasn't been since the legendary Bobby Fischer-Boris Spassky "match of the century" in 1972. Carlsen is athletic, good looking (a former model) and a heartthrob in Norway, and he has an easygoing sense of humor, which means a normal person is the face of a sport unfairly tagged as a sanctuary for dorks. He's a sly devil, too. In Game 1, he went with the Trompowsky Attack, an opening rarely used in such high-profile games. It was named after a Brazilian grandmaster of the 1930s, but it's believed Carlsen used it as a mirthful reference to our similarly named President-elect. This sort of thing may not send shivers down your spine, but to those of us who care, a dose of the old Trompowsky and we're asking "what are you trying to do, give us a heart attack?'' Carlsen is the heavy favorite to retain the title, but Karjakin, 26, is giving the champion all he can handle. Games 1 and 2 ended in draws, a common result in a sport where 80 percent of the matches between top competitors can end without victory or defeat. That doesn't bother aficionados of the sport, but it does bring a bit of a nil-nil soccer aroma to novice fans. Some of them might like the speed-chess tiebreaker if this match goes 6-6 (one point for a win, a half-point for a draw), but we abhor this prostitution of the sport, a chess version of penalty kicks or the hockey shootout. Outside Fulton's Market, an older man carried a handmade sign. "I need a ticket,'' his scrawl said. "That might be the most pathetic thing I've ever seen,'' I told a friend, half-joking. But the man loved chess, so even in his haggard state, he was among friends. If chess ever goes mainstream, the organizers will have to raise their game. The World Championship advertised 300 tickets per game, but the viewing room was cramped, dark and limited to no more than 100 seats, with no video board to help follow the action. In this setting, separated from the playing area by soundproof glass, we watched two men sit and think as we tried to follow the moves on our phones. After 15 minutes, we were asked to leave so others could watch for awhile. Some groups saw no moves in their 15 minutes. They had to be satisfied with watching Carlsen drink water or Karjakin scratch his head. The viewing was better in the larger outside room. Benches were plentiful, a snack area offered decent food, a TV screen showed the players, a video board allowed us to follow the moves and commentators analyzed what had happened and what might come next. The world's top players include a few Americans, and as unbeatable as Carlsen seems, an American star would elevate the sport in this country. Even so, if chess ever does gain widespread popularity, organizers might face the same problems golf encountered when Tiger Woods stole the show and unwashed masses took over the course, trampling traditions of decorum and most fairways. Within the sport, analysts also seem obsessed with the 1972 Fischer-Spassky Cold War showdown. They refer to it all the time and sure, it captivated the world in a way no chess match has done before or since, but isn't there anything else to talk about after 44 years? Chess is a sport because the demands on its participants are not just mental but physical. Cardiovascular tests on players at stressful moments show levels that equal or exceed that of catchers, quarterbacks and goalies. It's no coincidence that Carlsen and Karjakin are both in their mid-20s. The best players must be in tip-top shape, which means the Mets' Bartolo Colon will never be a champion, and by the time you're 40, you're done as an elite contender. I won't try to convince you to love chess, beyond saying it's not just a grandmaster's game but enjoyed by all ages, both genders and at any skill level. As the World Championship enters its middle stages, you might ignore it but legions of fans will be on the edge of their seats. At least until their 15 minutes are up and they're told they have to move.

Published Wed, Nov 26, 2014  |  Floyd Brown, Political Expert Amazon (AMZN) started Black Friday deals early, but don’t count me in this year. I’ve been a customer of Amazon almost from the beginning, when all they delivered were books. I don’t know how many thousands of dollars of merchandise I’ve ordered over the years, but it’s likely in the tens of thousands. I adopted Amazon because it fit my busy lifestyle. Instead of having to visit Wal-Mart (WMT) and hustle from aisle to aisle… just to wait in a long line to pay for my merchandise… Amazon allowed me to buy with a few clicks and find the product at my doorstep just days later. But after making its worst business decision ever, I will forever boycott using the site. And I might not be alone… At first, Amazon’s premium service, Amazon Prime, improved on the customer experience. With no shipping and two-day delivery, there was no way to beat it. My Amazon purchases exploded. In fact, I was so addicted to Amazon last year that I spent most of Black Friday on the site completing my Christmas list. No need to fight the crowds at the mall. No need for rain checks. Heck, they even delivered my out-of-town gifts directly to the intended recipient. All of this joy is over now, however… Serious Lapse in Judgment If you’re a regular Amazon customer, you’ve likely noticed a change. Amazon dropped the United Parcel Service (UPS), and it increased shipping with the United States Postal Service (USPS). Amazon made a deal with the Devil, and the customers are now required to pay. Let me explain… When the deal was announced, the U.S. Postal Service thought it was the lifeline it needed to survive. Since bills and most correspondence now come via email – and checks are often delivered by Automated Clearing House (ACH) – the USPS has lost its reason to exist. Mail volume has plummeted and most of the mail delivered these days never makes it past the trash can into the house. They’re bleeding financially. Now, Amazon pays huge delivery fees, and it’s looking to build its own fleet of trucks and vehicles to deliver packages. Instead, it thought it had a match made in heaven: Take the excess capacity of the USPS, and make it the delivery system for Amazon. Makes sense, right? But there’s a major problem with the equation. Amazon is going from being the best firm at delivering products… to being one of the worst. From Pick-Up Lines to Picket Lines In the past, the United Parcel Service would leave the parcels at your doorstep. Instead, USPS wants to cram it into your mailbox. But if you miss your mail for a day or the package doesn’t fit into your mailbox, you’re out of luck… the parcels end up back in the dead letter room at your local post office. So instead of delivery, the Amazon customer has to go to pick up the package at the Post Office. That’s a line even more dreaded than Wal-Mart’s. Americans hate standing in the USPS line. And this is what’s happening to thousands of Amazon customers around the nation. Instead of enjoying the delivery of Amazon Prime, you’re now faced with the hell of waiting in the line at the Post Office. What sounded like a good idea on paper is a disaster for the Amazon customer. I wonder if Jeff Bezos and the other leaders of Amazon know what they’re doing to their own customers. If this keeps up, they soon will.

Comments (246) Lonnie Philpott says: November 26, 2014 at 6:29 am Not much different at UPS. Every time I order something it seems there is a reason why it cannot be left at the house so a trip to the UPS office is in order and their lines and lack of caring is as bad or worse than USPS. I, for one, get better service from USPS. [Reply] V Paiva Reply: November 26th, 2014 at 12:04 pm Not only is a trip to UPS as bad as USPS, but here where I live I have to travel to another city to the UPS terminal. There isn’t one in this city. [Reply] Heather Reply: January 27th, 2015 at 12:59 pm My issue with the USPS delivery is that to fulfill their Amazon two day obligation they mark the package as delivered when they never even came to my house. Has happened at least ten times. This is hurting small business owners who use USPS and then have to eat the coast of the first order. I’ve called the post office before and I know they are lying about the delivery and I say that I will report it to the shipper and they just say “go ahead”. They have to scan a bar code on my mailbox for mail delivery. Not sure why they wouldn’t have to do that for packages. It’s a total scam. [Reply] Richard Reply: March 26th, 2015 at 11:44 am I agree! This has happened to me as well. I was definitely home early and awaiting my package in the room where a knock or doorbell would have definitely been heard. Screw them. My item was cheap. I’ll just not pick it up at all and they have send it back costing them more labor as I order my item from some place else. I don’t mind picking it up if they had actually come and missed me but they definitely lied in my case. Mike Reply: April 23rd, 2015 at 7:31 pm This has happened to me several times recently. Our post office here in Corpus Christi says they “attempted delivery” but I was home each time and the doorbell never rang. I have had to wait until Saturday, when I am not working, to drive up to the post office to pick up my package. They have lost a priority mailed package and certified letter as well in recent weeks. I ask for a manager and the are always conveniently unavailable and never return my calls. I am done with USPS, and if Amazon doesn’t begin to offer options other than USPS I will cancel my prime membership and be done with Amazon. WhyMeLord Reply: August 8th, 2015 at 2:02 pm I can receive a package from China faster than I can a package sent one (small) town over. FWIW I can walk to that shipper’s location faster than USPS delivers. The problem has gotten so bad that on our purchase orders we advise vendors that any package shipped via USP is at their risk. USP tracking confirms the deliver two or three days BEFORE it is delivered. Complaints to Postal inspector are ignored. A letter to the Postmaster by name sent to the Washington Office the address was provided by my congress critter) was returned stamped “Addressee Unknown” david Reply: January 11th, 2016 at 10:21 pm The barcode they scan on your mailbox has nothing to do with your deliver of mail. That is scanned to show where they are at a given time and would be scanned regardless of whether you had mail or not. I’m curious why you people have so many problems having Amazon packages not delivered. 99% of the packages that Amazon sends out are sent “carrier-leave if not response” meaning the packages should be left whether you’re home or not. I’d drop that on the post office next time you call. Leaving that isn’t even optional for the carrier. great grandma Reply: February 13th, 2016 at 8:42 am Two companies that I ordered on line from,one sent UPS,but had them delivered to the Post Office,the other sent Fed Ex,who they also delivered to the Post Office.I will not order from either of these companies again.Ask who will be delivering your package,but make sure you ask if that company will be making that delivery to your home. Mike Reply: March 3rd, 2016 at 10:19 am Exactly right. This mostly happens for Sunday delivery. They simply will not deliver on Sunday. They lie about trying. I have been home and nothing was left on the door AND it was marked “LEAVE” which requires nothing else. Magically, the next business day they leave it at the door. Greg Brandeau Reply: December 30th, 2014 at 3:51 am I’m not sure if it is where I live (LA) or something else, but both USPS and UPS are terrific at leaving packages at my house that won’t fit in my mailbox and/or that need to be signed for. In addition, both UPS and USPS allow you to re-route your package or sign for your package on their websites. My experience with Amazon and USPS over the holidays has been fantastic! Same with UPS. [Reply] Andrew R. Reply: March 12th, 2015 at 7:50 pm I live in Baton Rouge, LA. I have had the same experience. However, my friends and family do not. I think it depends on the letter carrier and their delivery schedule. My packages always come to my doorstep on time. I have relatives that have home security cameras. We have evidence of the letter carrier leaving a notice in their mailbox instead of attempting a delivery. As a result of this, they only choose the one day shipping on Amazon so that UPS or FedEx will make a successful delivery. [Reply] Dawn N Reply: May 30th, 2015 at 9:54 pm I chose 1 day delivery, and it’s being shipped via USPS. JJthe DAGGER Reply: June 29th, 2015 at 8:45 pm I don’t get this. I’m a carrier with the USPS and I would rather deliver a package then sit in front of your mailbox and fill out a slip for you to pick the package up at the USPS, haul your package around all day and then haul it back into the office. I really can’t comprehend why any carrier would do this when most days you barely have any room to move. I question the validity of your responses. Think about what I just wrote because this leaving notices and hauling a full truck of parcels back to unload at the local USPS doesn’t sound realistic. I think most of you just have an ax to grind and decided to talk out of your rears. steven Reply: May 7th, 2015 at 8:56 am I work for the USPS and we are instructed to leave parcels at the doorstep unless it’s not considered safe or bad weather [Reply] Charlene Reply: October 21st, 2015 at 12:40 pm Well, you don’t work for every state now do you! People are not going to find the time to come on here and make a crazy remarks for the fun of it. I have been a amazon customer since 2000 and postal service has slacked off for about a year now in my area. I don’t get my packages left on my premises even though its secured and of course I am the one who is placing the order so I am fully aware that I would not be home to receive it. People do work and that was the benefit for becoming a prime member in the first place and be able to enjoy the 3 day delivery. Even now requesting redelivery attempts are not made until after my 3 requests on the USPS website. I don’t see the logic is wasting gas to come all the way to my home just to go back and dump it at the post office. If this is the method that supervisors are telling their workers to get people to come into the Post office then its a dumb idea. I can have a tiny amazon package that has a scented oil in the box go back to the post office! It’s ludicrous. Sm Reply: November 28th, 2015 at 4:50 am Same here. Been with USPS for a year. Its a total pain in the a$$ to bring parcels back with me. The only way I do is if the business is closed or it’s a signature confirmation and they weren’t home. RachelK Reply: February 7th, 2016 at 10:33 am The issues we have with nondelivery are that the carrier doesn’t even bring the packages, because my spouse has met him at the mailbox while he was filling out the slip and my spouse asked where the package was and the carrier responded that he left it back at the post office. We’ve also had A LOT of packages stolen, even spoke with an 1811 who said they are aware there are a lot of thefts going on and there is an active investigation (in other words, tough luck to us.) As I type this, I’ve had a puppet that I ordered for my play therapy kit marked as delivered, and it never was. Sadly, most of what disappears through the Houston Street office is toys (both sending and receiving.) and identification (My husband was notified that his DL was being used by someone else, the DL that disappeared at the Houston St office 3x.) I will probably order my books and play therapy stuff through other sellers that use UPS or Fed Ex. My Amazon Prime account though, I may just not renew because we never use it like netflix, and with everything going through USPS (meaning I may not get everything) it’s not worth the money. Joe Reply: July 2nd, 2015 at 4:21 pm I’m on hold with UPS right now and Amazon and I are begging them to allow store pick-up as I won’t be home to sign for the package. Instead of working with Amazon to fulfill MY request, this is supposed to be about me I thought, UPS is insistent they most uphold the terms of their contract with Amazon though we are requesting flexibility to fulfill my request. I guess it’s more important that the contract, which I’m not party to, be upheld despite Amazon’s request then the sale be completed. I thought “the market” was about responsiveness to customer needs? [Reply] sam Reply: October 26th, 2016 at 7:45 pm The customer you refer to is not the receiver of the package; for the delivery company their customer is the shipper who pays the postage. Terry Lamb Reply: January 19th, 2015 at 1:53 pm I think this author has been smoking something! Here it is, MLK day and the USPS just 2 packages at my front door. I get excellent delivery service no matter how they ship my order so go boycott all you want! [Reply] Numnutz2005 Reply: February 22nd, 2015 at 6:23 pm Thats imposible dude….usps delivers NO packages on MLK day so if your going to lie at least make sense. Their holiday schedule is posted on their site too. [Reply] Mike Reply: February 23rd, 2015 at 4:13 pm I work for USPS. We worked MLK day. Amazon packages go 365 except christmas and thanksgiving. Whether we deliver mail or not that day, Amazon goes. Paul Reply: October 12th, 2015 at 10:34 am its Columbus day, my carrier just made a delivery from amazon, spoke with carrier, she told they are required to deliver all amazon packages, my regular mail was not delivered today William Doores Reply: February 25th, 2015 at 2:36 pm Speak for yourself Mike. I can’t get a package delivered by the Post Office. I think it is mainly because my carrier is too lazy or too stupid to do his job. I NEVER use the Post Office to mail a package. Some of them couldn’t pour piss out of a boot. [Reply] Jo Reply: July 3rd, 2015 at 8:10 pm You don’t know what you are talking about, William Doores. Calling a carrier lazy or stupid…? Grow up a-hole… sam Reply: October 26th, 2016 at 7:49 pm This idiot William Doores needs to go to work at USPS and see what it is all about☺ Noah Reply: March 4th, 2015 at 5:07 pm My thing is if I wanted to go out and get something I purchased on amazon I would’ve just gone to the store. What I see is packages going straight to the post office for pickup so I can sign for them here as if I couldn’t do that if the mail man brought it here anyway. [Reply] Mego Reply: July 15th, 2015 at 6:56 pm I am a Seattleite that is fed up with this “deal with the devil” Amazon has made with USPS. Amazon’s poor choice of shipping results in many lost hours & frustration to me, the customer. As a business owner, the hours I spend tracking down shipments, calling their customer service for refunds, not to mention the time I spent researching and ordering the items I chose to begin with – makes AMAZON the most COSTLY PLACE for me to spend money anymore. USPS will not even get out of their truck to walk a package to your front door. Nor do I have an option of choosing a delivery method that is reliable for me, the CUSTOMER. I just spent 45 minutes on the phone to cancel almost $700 worth of merchandise I purchased within the last couple of days. I received that same text message everyone else is talking about here: “Delivery Attempted: We were not able to deliver your Amazon package with Fujitsu ScanSnap IX 500 Scanner and 4 other items. We’ll try again tomorrow. Then it leaves tracking information.” When I log into my account it says I need to look for the Notice left on my door for further instructions. No Notice. Why? Because they didn’t even bother to get their lazy you-know-whats out of the truck to walk to the door. I have been waiting since 8:00 this morning and it is now 3:50 pm (PST) Nobody even ‘attempted’ to deliver and they couldn’t care less about the time Amazon’s customer’s waste away from work or other important parts of their lives as AMAZON & USPS continue to disappoint again and again. For condominiums (aka multifamily housing) USPS will only drop everything off at an office location on site wherein it is immediately lost, broken or only open during business hours – which are the same hours everyone else is at work! This is ridiculously frustrating and absolutely NOT “Customer-centric.” I used to have a lot of respect for Jeff Bezos and his philosophy to build a business by creating it from the customer point of view. Obviously he hasn’t googled his own shipping problems for quite a few years as rants about this same issue go back for years. This is nothing new and Amazon stands silent on the issue IGNORING THEIR CUSTOMERS. There are plenty of alternatives and AMAZON PRIME isn’t really worth much without the 2-day shipping guarantee. Buying from e-bay or a MULTITUDE of other online retail stores not to mention just walking into a local store is so much less frustrating and much more satisfying for my overall customer experience. Shame on you Amazon. This Seattleite is taking her business elsewhere from now on. You owe your customers a public apology for this fiasco. [Reply] Jen Reply: September 6th, 2015 at 4:29 pm Amazon bans you permanently from buying on their website if you complain or return items as well! Their attitude is basically you take what we give you regardless of what the terms were when you ordered, or you can stick it you-know-where. Customer-centric – haha what a joke! [Reply] Bmack Reply: August 27th, 2015 at 10:20 pm I work at a post office in Youngstown, Ohio and I ALWAYS choose UPS or FedEx when I have the option. I told my Postal manager that 2 Amazon Prime packages were not delivered. He just laughed! [Reply] Frank Reply: September 19th, 2015 at 9:30 am I don’t care how my items come ups or fed ex I just prefer not the postal service. The idiots that deliver my mail can’t read. On this route we have yelled for years about wrong house number or wrong street on the mail. For some reason they can’t read the whole address when you call to complain all you get is we got a new carrier again since this walking house to house is too hard for one to stay on the route. I can’t even tell you how many deliveries have been lost both that I know about and never knew. I try to get everything shipped ups instead of USPS at least I know they will deliver it. If I ship something out I have to go to the post office and pay the extra signature required just to make sure it goes to the right place. I laugh every time I see those commercials about the USPS dedication to your mail. I understand there may be mistakes once on awhile but this happens every week for over 3 years now. [Reply] K. Miehl Reply: December 19th, 2015 at 1:13 am I have lost 2 packeages for my Christmas orders within 2 weeks !!!! This has never happened to me before, with Amazon using UPS for delivery. This is Frustrating and Unbelieveable !!!! >:( [Reply] Vinny d Reply: February 12th, 2016 at 4:17 pm Placed order on Amazon. Product coming from Vegas to Connecticut USPS said delivery Febuary 11. Was sent feb 8. Just got email it’s in California. I’m dropping Amazon [Reply] Dr. Clark says: November 26, 2014 at 6:34 am I’ve noticed a few other things. Packages are being sent through FedEx and when the package reaches the nearest city they are given to the USPS adding 3 more days to the shipping. In addition, if a product doesn’t work, the customer has to pay for return shipping and the customer is charged for the original shipping on top of it. Therefore, I ended up paying $8 for a product I don’t have. [Reply] Veronica E Lowe Reply: February 2nd, 2015 at 1:20 pm that handoff only occurs when you use free super saver shipping. this article is about amazon prime. that said, however, I’ve had no problem with either one being left at the door. and have always received any packages with guaranteed delivery dates, on that date. [Reply] Namma Reply: February 6th, 2015 at 11:38 am That’s not true. I’ve been a Prime member for three years and the last seven month have been horrendous in getting a package delivered. One even was labeled Parcel Post even though I have never changed my default Prime Membership shipping method of 2 days. My last order was sent UPS Ground. Amazon is experimenting, however, they fail in that there is NO feedback and no way for the customer to insist on not using certain methods such as SurePost, SmartPost, etc., etc. WE, the customer, KNOW our delivery carriers strengths and weaknesses and Amazon DOES NOT. Nor is there a direct mechanism in place for Amazon to collect customer feedback about shipping and take the no doubt thousands of complaints up with their “shipping partners” as being violations of the contract, IF they included this in the contract. Hopefully they aren’t that stupid. If this continues I will quit Prime. There’s no point to it since the offerings on the remainder of Prime seem to fit a much younger demographic and are not to my taste. Businesses NEED to remember that they NEED the customer more than the customer needs them. If you doubt this simply search – DIY – and see the resurgence in making things on your own cutting out the merchant and the delivery nightmare that many have resorted to. 543 millions results are about what you will get. [Reply] Andrew R. Reply: March 12th, 2015 at 8:00 pm I completely agree. I don’t understand why the customer can’t be given the option to choose the shipping carrier as opposed to the delivery time. All three carriers are more than willing to negotiate and Amazon already has a built in shipping calculator. I wish Amazon would have the options laid out plain and simple, instead of letting the system or seller choose one by default. Example: What Amazon Currently Has: 1 Day Shipping- $3.99 (Guaranteed by March 14, 2015) 2 Day Shipping- FREE (Guaranteed by March 15, 2015) Standard Shipping – FREE (Guaranteed by March 20, 2015) What I Would Like: UPS Next Day Air- $4.99 (Guaranteed by March 14, 2015) FedEx Standard Overnight- $3.99 (Guaranteed by March 14, 2015) USPS Priority Mail Express- $3.99 (Guaranteed by March 14/15, 2015 depending on location) UPS 2nd Day Air- FREE FedEx 2Day- FREE USPS Priority Mail 2/3 Day- FREE UPS Ground- FREE FedEx Home Delivery- FREE USPS Parcel Select- FREE, $1 Back on Prime Membership Cost This way the customer has the option of choosing the delivery time AND shipping carrier. David Reply: June 3rd, 2015 at 8:28 pm Are you high? You can’t understand because your clueless of what the actual cost of shipping is, that’s made abundantly clear with this UPS Next Day Air- $4.99 (Guaranteed by March 14, 2015) FedEx Standard Overnight- $3.99 (Guaranteed by March 14, 2015) USPS Priority Mail Express- $3.99 (Guaranteed by March 14/15, 2015 depending on location) USPS offers flat rate boxes at 44$ But you somehow think your 99 bucks means that amazon should eat 40 bucks. Mego Reply: July 15th, 2015 at 7:00 pm Well said, Namma Tim Reply: August 30th, 2015 at 2:57 pm I agree. Amazon should allow the customer to choose the method – company, speed and cost – of shipping items they want. If you like priority mail, choose USPS, if you like UPS or FEDEX choose them. The company’s shipping matrix is broken. sam Reply: October 26th, 2016 at 7:57 pm GET OFF YOUR REAR END AND GO SHOPPING!!!!! THIS WHOLE COMMENT SECTION SOUNDS LIKE MY TWO 5TH GRADERS Steven Palmer Reply: December 5th, 2015 at 7:36 pm Just purchased 2 separate items. I used Amazon.com credit card, then it says use the free 2 day since I have prime. Dec 1. it says 2 day, plus I checked weekends are good, too. Friday gets here, no package. Then it is changed to Sunday. They apparently kept driving from central California, past Albany, Oregon another 1.5 hours to Portland. Then took the package all the way back to Albany, close to where I live. I gave them both my Box number and my physical address to make sure I get it. What could go wrong? They locked up my package in Albany and changed it to Dec 8. Now my 2 day delivery is locked up 20 minute from me and will be one week late. Screw Amazon, screw UPS! Screw Amazon credit card. I don’t need them. I have 50 CC’s, others with zero balance. Shove Amazon prime! 15 years of doing business with Amazon, and it just goes downhill. [Reply] Karen Reply: August 20th, 2015 at 7:35 am I worked for UPS for 27 years and recently retired. I can pretty much guarantee that UPS is not losing Amazon. What is happening is UPS and FedEx is contracting with the post office to pick up these packages in bulk from the shipper like Amazon, deliver to the post office and pay $1.00 for each package delivered that can be put in a mailbox. If an address is scanned in the UPS system like a large box that won’t fit in a mailbox and a smaller package is going to same address they are delivered by UPS, but if a small package is the only one going to that address it will be taken to post office for delivery. As drivers we didn’t like this because it held up the package for a day and customers couldn’t understand why it said UPS was delivering but it came by USPS. We could never understand how this could be profitable but I can guarantee that if it wasn’t UPS wouldn’t do it. Hopefully I have cleared up some of this but I may have made it more confusing. [Reply] Joe Reply: September 18th, 2015 at 7:37 am That is completely right. UPS takes packages to almost every post office every day. They give USPS packages that are not cost effective for their delivery person to deliver. [Reply] i hate people Reply: January 4th, 2016 at 3:28 pm No, you guys are dead wrong. I work at USPS, and Amazon made a deal with USPS to allow them to deliver their packages on Sundays. FedEx, UPS, and most carrier companies don’t deliver on Sunday but the post office do now. This is a contract between USPS and Amazon, and it has absolutely nothing to do with UPS and FedEx, and they are losing out in the end. Tom says: November 26, 2014 at 6:48 am Maybe you order things too small. I ordered from Amazon just last week, and UPS delivered yesterday to me. However, much of what FedEx has been charged with delivering by sellers has been coming the final step via USPS. Almost everything that has FedEx charges, USPS delivers to me. [Reply] Dennis Rogers says: November 26, 2014 at 9:10 am Amazon prime is slow delivering some packages such as book up to a week and a half, I recently recieved an email thanking me for purchasing a program on amazon fire tv which I did not want when I tried to cancel the order I was informed it would cost $35.00 for something I did not order. Amazon and I do not do business at this time. [Reply] John Reply: March 4th, 2015 at 11:10 pm This the worse service I’ve ever had ordering from anyone. I order some compression shirts which I didn’t know coming from Korea , still in route two weeks later and was told I have 31 more days to wait. when ask for my refund I told when I get my stuff back you get your money back. which I’m sure will take 2 more months are longer. Make sure you read delivery date. Not shipping date. [Reply] Kodster says: November 26, 2014 at 10:10 am I don’t have any problem with Amazon… I’m a Prime member, and I specifically choose a street shipping address in order to get the expedited, guaranteed shipping of 2-days, because I have a PO Box, as well, and that’s my billing address. I’m REQUIRED to have a PO Box in the town I live in, since I live within the city limits. The only issue I have is with FedEx… if they do SmartPost (deliver to the post office, who in turn delivers to me), I don’t have any issues… however, if they are required to deliver directly to my home? Forget it. If I’m lucky, I’ll see the package a week later than it was supposed to be guaranteed to be delivered. UPS… no problems, right on time, and as expected. Point is, we ALL have issues with the delivery systems that Amazon contracts with. Until people get it in their heads that they, as well as we, are customers of each other, and should treat each accordingly (that Golden Rule… treat others as you would want to be treated yourself), nothing is going to change. [Reply] Ben Ther says: November 26, 2014 at 10:35 am I applaud Amazon for going with USPS. I am much more likely to purchase more from them because of it. And returns that you have to pay for is totally reimbursed. You’re not out anything. This is one area that could use some tweaking. It is aggravating to have to return something at your own expense but you don’t lose out in the end. Get over it, Floyd Brown. What this really is is right wing propaganda. I prefer USPS over any other shipper. [Reply] D Reply: December 12th, 2014 at 3:37 pm That doesnt work for everyone and some areas, including mine, have a terrible USPS system and no matter what I do, nothing changes. When Amazon shipped with UPS, everything was FINE. Now the problems are starting…Having to go to pick up my packages at the local PO. Missing packages that say delivered but end up being, you guessed it, at the local PO, etc…Never once did I have a problem with UPS. It has nothing to do with “right wing”.

[Reply] Vera C Reply: July 16th, 2015 at 8:40 pm YUP this has happened to my boyfriend. He ordered from Amazon and paid extra for next day shipping. The tracking showed delivered but there’s NOTHING. It also happened when my friend bought me a hardrive through Amazon with expedited shipping and tracking showed that it was delivered but there was absolutely NOTHING in my mailbox nor anything at front door, porch, ANYWHERE! ! And OF COURSE it just happened to me again! Tracking said that it was delivered Monday july 13,2015. And I haven’t seen my package ANYWHERE nor was there even any notices left for me!! I think that the mail lady here COULD POSSIBLY be stealing the amazon packages. Or she’s just so much in a hurry that she could have placed it with one of my neighbors packages. I’ve seen her scanning A LOT of packages ALL ONE AFTER ANOTHER and not put them in the mailbox after each scan. (I was tanning at the pool, mailboxes for our apartment complex is in clear view from the pool). I’ve received my neighbors packages with my packages SOOOOO many times before. I have the courtesy to just hand deliver them to the correct address (knocking at my neighbor’s door, if they aren’t home then I leave it at their front door) . That’s not my job to do that. But I do that only because I KNOW how it feels to lose a package. .. the USPS here in La Verne Had no phone number to call and complain to. No 800 number …nothing.. and the people at the post office don’t even bother to check. When my boyfriend went in there to try to pick up his package that was never delivered, the lady told him to come back later so that she has time to look for it. He came back a few hours later and she said she didn’t get to check yet. He asked her to please go and check, all she did was walk in the doors and walked right back out and said she couldn’t find it…. it’s like WTF??!! YOU DIDN’T EVEN BOTHER LOOKING AROUND AND DIDN’T ACTUALLY CHECK ALL YOU DID WAS WALK IN AND RIGHT BACK OUT OF THE DOORS!! … no manager was available to complain to. .. USPS F***ING SUCKS! ! AND IS ALWAYS LOSING PACKAGES! !! ANY PACKAGES THROUGH UPS IS ALWAYS on time and I’d any delays.. you would know. .. customers are always able to know where their packages are with UPS. … I’M SO SICK OF LOSING PACKAGES THAT ARE BOUGHT THOUGH AMAZON!! It almost seems like a scam. Especially when you have paid extra for expedited shipping! And suddenly never receive it but tracking shows delivered! ! Soooo shady!! [Reply] NotRightWing Reply: February 6th, 2015 at 10:10 am Why would this be “right wing propoganda” and why do you prefer USPS get the business? THAT sounds like liberal ideology to me. Allow me to clarify.. The US Post Office is NOT a government agency. they are quasi govermental. That means they skirt federal taxes (oops, liberals should be groaning). UPS and FedEx pay enormous amounts of federal taxes (yay!). So please help me understand your glee over an inferior service handling packages? [Reply] Ron Reply: July 12th, 2015 at 5:02 pm I’m a liberal and I despise USPS. I’ve already complained to Amazon about the decline in service since they dumped UPS and switched to USPS. Postal carriers are the worst. FedEx and UPS employees are far better and give far better service. And it has nothing to do with political ideology. Remember, the postal service was “privatized” years ago.

The only exception is inclement weather (I leave my personal cell number so a customer can call me for a re-delivery the next day) or someone has requested that the package not be left. If you want your packages left at the door, simply go to USPS.com and request that the carrier leave the package. Now that isn’t so hard, is it?

Lately I’ve come to think of myself as an unpaid USPS employee, who has taken on the job of re-delivering packages mis-delivered by my carrier. This, despite having mailbox at my curb with two-inch-high letters with my street number. UPS messes up, too, just not as often.

It is maddening. Our previous carrier was AWESOME and he was so frustrated with USPS he quit after a decade of working for USPS.

Their prices can not be beat by Wal-Mart or anyone else. So as far as I am concerned I have NO problems and usually my shipping is free. I do not see a reason not to continue to do business with them. Maybe what you are ordering is something that they do not stock and has to come from someone else. If and when I have a problem then at that time I will contact them and see what they do. [Reply] Luke says: November 26, 2014 at 4:03 pm Fantastic. UPS has one of the worst services. On Monday I ordered a product from Amazon at around 1:00pm. I was expecting a two-day delivery (I’m a Prime customer). Guess what? The package came next day at around 5:00pm. Since USPS workers can access apartment buildings they can reach your apartment directly. This a problem for FedEx and UPS. The difference is that FedEx does allow you to pick up your package after certain hours. Good luck doing this with UPS. Overall, I’m glad that Amazon is not using UPS anymore. [Reply] THE POSTMAN says: November 26, 2014 at 4:11 pm Mr. Brown you can calm your nerves. The USPS has instructions (at least in south east Texas) to leave any Amazon package at the customers door, no matter what. So if you have the type of address where the postman has access to your front door, the package will be left. Have you communicated with your postman? Simple, DIRECT communication with your postman goes a long way to getting those Amazon packages delivered right. [Reply] LINDA Reply: December 15th, 2014 at 1:38 pm Hey Postman, how can I get my mailman to deliver? My Amazon Prime membership now gets me Delivery notices that show delivered but no package.

The new carrier I have can’t even close the door on the mailbox let alone bring something to my porch like the old carrier did. [Reply] Windy Reply: December 23rd, 2014 at 9:14 pm My post man does the same thing!! He is so lazy. He stuffs a package in my mail box that I have difficulty removing.

Never had to make a trip to the post office and most packages arrive within 2 days. My Amazon orders have increased 100% since USPS began delivering them. If your packages go back to the dead letter room at the post office then you have a problem with your post office not USPS as a whole.

[Reply] Jeff W says: November 27, 2014 at 10:18 am I don’t know who the author of this piece is but his bias against the USPS is pretty obvious. Also, he is completely wrong about how USPS delivers. I have worked at the USPS for 20 years , the last 8 have been in a branch office. I see Amazon packages everyday, brought to us from both fed ex and UPS for last mile delivery. On average between both carriers about 500-600 parcels a day, many more right now. I am also a loyal amazon prime customer, and have been for more than 5 years. Gotten many things from them as well. First of all, UPS still delivers Amazon. It does depend on size since UPS started doing dimensional pricing. If it is small, they will probably not deliver. But in some cases they do. I see people everyday come in our PO, complain about our price and say they are going to UPS. They always come back. As far as your package delivery, we leave parcels at places all the time! I have no idea where you live, but unless it is in a place where the carrier think it is unsafe, they will leave that parcel. If they don’t call and complain. Personally I would rather have someone who cares about my security than just leaving it and going. Also, sign the notice left for you and they will received. Happens all the time. This is really another case of some anti federal government idiot who thinks life would be better and his prices lower if we did not exist. We are the only ones that will deliver to every address. That is why the others drop off to us…they can’t deliver to certain places and keep costs down. If we weren’t around, you would be paying through the nose or driving to a centralized pick up point for your parcels. And as far as waiting at the PO for stuff, management has cut our staffing back so much that we cannot keep our unit fully staffed. That is a whole different issue that I would love to discuss with this moron. Bottom line, we do it right and it most cases cheaper. If he has problems I dare say they are of his own creation. This article was a biased piece of untruths and blather. [Reply] Ron W Reply: December 27th, 2014 at 10:43 am Jeff says they do it cheaper than fed-ex or ups. What about the Billions of dollars the post office lose each year. If they had to make a profit like private business does to stay in business. These billion dollar losses have to be paid sooner or later by the tax payers. The USPS would be higher than private services if they had to recoup their cost of doing business and having taxpayers pay. [Reply] Brian Reply: January 25th, 2015 at 1:19 am Usps does not receive any taxpayer money. Do your homework before you say stupid things. Since 2006, the Post Office has been legally required to pre-fund health benefits for future retirees at a cost of around $5.5 billion a year. The only business or branch of the government forced to do this. And none of the is taxpayer money. [Reply] Chas Reply: December 27th, 2014 at 2:40 pm Going with USPS major mistake, at least in my area. Prime 2 day takes 3 to 5 days using USPS. I’ve had a number of packages that “track your package” says it will be delivered by such and such day by 8pm, no way USPS delivers that late. Tracking say delivery attempted- couldn’t leave unattended. In variably the package appears the next day in or on my mail box which several hundred feet from my house next to a major expressway. A Macbook Air was left “unattended” on top of mail box in the rain. Found it before water had reached the laptop. Waiting today for package tracking says will be delivered by 8pm today, BS, won’t see it till Monday. [Reply] Chaupt Reply: February 18th, 2015 at 9:06 pm If the box is say 40-50lbs, USPS has either left if in the middle of my driveway so I have to get out of my car to remove it, or they put an “attempted delivery” notice in my mailbox and make me drive out of my way to go get it after standing in line to turn in the slip and waiting for them to find where the box was stashed and then get a dolly to roll it out to me. Amazon! This is not acceptable. And, yes, I have had the trouble of them smashing items that don’t really fit into the mailbox too! Had to actually cut one apart piece by piece to get at the item inside!! [Reply] Robbie Reply: February 21st, 2015 at 3:52 pm I don’t know if it’s regional or not, but the USPS carrier for my area will not leave any packages at the front door.

Things were much better for me when Amazon used UPS and I could get everything delivered to the front door. [Reply] Dan Reply: April 23rd, 2015 at 6:26 pm I don’t have an issue with my carrier, but the USPS has gotten so slow in my area, its plain ridiculous. It takes 7 days for a letter to get from Florida to Maine. Packages that use the USPS take 3-5 days longer than with UPS/FEDEX. Why does it take 2 days for a package to be delivered by my local postman? They tell me it’s because Amazon and some other stores use palletized shipping. It’s great if you are served by a post office serving thousands, but the rural post offices get the stuff when UPS/FEDEX feels like dropping off a pallet. Small PO’s may not get a pallet every day. It’s all about saving money, and I understand, but deliver that slow should be much cheaper than regular FEDEX or UPS. [Reply] Jenna says: November 27, 2014 at 4:32 pm I completely disagree!! It really depends on what you have ordered. I love Amazon like you do. And my brother has an Amazon prime membership as well. I have seen Amazon deliveries coming from UPS as well. I agree USPS delivers most of them BUT I can never blame them for poor service. Most of the times, my package is left at my front porch (behind a pillar) and my area has low theft rate (central CA). And in case the USPS employee takes it along, I do not encounter long lines- cause I know the USPS office opens at 8am when there will be no one there. If I am expecting a delivery today and I am too lazy to get it from the post office, then I’ll be sure to open my door when the postman rings my doorbell. I think Amazon is amazing as usual. Local post offices are closer to homes for a reason. And if they are really that FAR, and the lines are really that long 24/7, then shop at Walmart. 😉 [Reply] Dwiniger says: November 27, 2014 at 7:42 pm So true. Waiting on a watch now. Lost tracking of the item after 3 days when it went to Ohio by mistake. I paid for Prime. Item only needed to ship less than 100 miles from origin to my house. Instead it left the state and nobody knows why or can tell me when to expect delivery. Amazon Prime? USPS? What a waste. Amazon literally laughed at me when I called them. They said to reorder another one. Brilliant advice! Defines insanity right??? [Reply] Steve says: November 27, 2014 at 9:31 pm Normal people would just get on the internet at USPS.com and set up a new deliver date, or just call the toll free number to get the item redelivered. Floyd Brown isn’t the brightest light shining… [Reply] Robert says: November 28, 2014 at 6:52 am This article is absolutely stupid. Anyone can simply call the phone number on back of USPS notice and request a new delivery date or just sign the back and write in when you want your package brought back out, it has a section for that on back if you read the notice then simply put in your mailbox and flip up your flag and they bring it back out on day you request. No lines, No fuss…..I love that Amazon uses USPS now. I seem to get my stuff even faster now. [Reply] Annette says: November 28, 2014 at 7:52 am Starting with Floyd Brown, some of these comments are way off. The USPS does not return the amazon packages that do not fit in your box. As a matter of fact, carriers have specific instruction to leave the package at the door step even if no response at the door. Also, as for the FedEx packages that USPS delivers, it may take FedEx a week to ship to USPS; however carriers are required to deliver no later than next day. Track your shipment on the internet and you’ll see exactly what I’m saying. Stop trash talking, particularly when you obviously do not know what you’re talking about. Facts First! [Reply] Shannon Reply: February 17th, 2015 at 3:10 am Untrue, they WILL claim it doesn’t fit in the box. I was supposed to receive a package today but did not. The tracking shows a notice was left that it was undeliverable due to being too large for the box OR that my box was too full. My box was empty of anything, including a notice of any sort. The Amazon customer service guy told me on his end it showed USPS would deliver tomorrow. Everything the author complains about in this post, I have experienced. I am also fed up with Amazon Prime due solely to their use of our horrible local USPS. [Reply] Amy says: November 28, 2014 at 8:28 am I disagree with the post. I have been using Amazon like you from just about the beginning and yes I have noticed that USPS delivers a lot more, BUT I have never had a problem with packages left by my door or somewhere on my porch if it doesn’t fit. NOT once have I had to go to the post office to pick up. [Reply] Lenny Reply: December 15th, 2014 at 12:48 pm Wrong! USPS leaves a little notification in my mail box stating that I need to pick up the package. I have to leave work early to stand in line at the Post Office. More than six times so far since October of this year. It’s pure laziness. UPS and Fedex ALWAYS delivered to my door. like most, I’m at work during the day when deliveries are suppose to be made. Complaining to my local Post Office hasn’t helped. Coming home to a package waiting for me at the door was what made the Amazon ordering process great. That seems to be over now. I have a large number of co-workers that have the same complaint.

Maybe YOU should get the facts first. [Reply] Jamie F. says: November 28, 2014 at 8:36 am You know what’s worse than having to trek down to the postal service? Leaving a package outside my backdoor during a rainstorm that’s been going on for several days! No, not a freak, oops, it ended up raining, a serious rain storm! I’d rather travel a few miles to get my stuff from the postal service instead of having it ruined and get a “you don’t have insurance” excuse, which Amazon does not offer.

Once in a while I order a regular book for my brother who is in prison and they follow through. I never had a problem with returns. They always give me credit back to my credit card and a return label. So Amazon is like everyone else: some like them, some don’t. [Reply] chad says: November 28, 2014 at 10:35 am I work for UPS and the USPS Amazon packages are parcel post and are too small for a driver to deliver it. Many times we deliver to a post office, a huge bag of letters and “smells” this is a way to help the post office out with business, and it helps UPS to focus on priority mail, ex. Next day air, Savers, two days, and just regular ground. When you have an organ on ice that is being shipped to a local hospital…..and you have the latest Nicholas Sparks book for a resident… It is easier to forget the book and give it to the mail service so you can focus on the priority. Hopefully this helps some of you understand this more. [Reply] Dustin Thomas says: November 28, 2014 at 3:48 pm I like the move to more USPS. I get my packages on Saturday or Sunday now when I’m actually home. My block has parcel lockers for when I’m not. UPS just “hides” them under the mat. Let’s be honest. USPS is cheaper anyway. They are lowering prices while UPS and FedEx are raising them. [Reply] Tiffany says: November 28, 2014 at 4:41 pm I think your article is very bias and left out much relevant information. I am an avid Prime user and I have many relatives that work for the USPS. You did not address the fact that you could actually schedule a redelivery online and make a request for the carrier to leave the package at your front step. You also left out that if you have to go to the USPS office for the package, they have a separate line (which is never long) for just picking up packages. Here’s another piece of info your “journalistic” writing failed to disclose: one of the reasons why Amazon did not extend their UPS contract is because they did not meet the 100% tracking protocol, while surprisingly, USPS did. Your article is full of misleading information. I wonder what your intentions were in writing this article? Maybe you want to SABOTAGE Amazon? Sorry, that’s pretty much impossible but your article is high up in SEO when I did a search for the USPS. Guess that was your strategy? [Reply] Quasi reporte^^ says: November 29, 2014 at 12:30 am What a misleading piece of ‘journalism’. Parcels are left at homes, notified via email of delivery time, and not brought back to a ‘dead letter’ office. Sheeeesh, do a little reseach into reality before relying on myths and/ or propagand. You got paid to do this? Sad. [Reply] Kelley says: November 29, 2014 at 12:38 am I’m preferring USPS these days because with UPS it ties me down waiting for the package whereas with the post office, the package goes in the mailbox and I can pick it up at my convenience. Also USPS packages move on the weekends while they stay put with UPS, which means sometimes the package arrives more quickly. To be fair, sometimes with the post office the pack comes more slowly. [Reply] Wendy says: November 29, 2014 at 12:53 pm I remember a few years ago the UPS strike had a lot of eBay sellers unexpectedly forced to use USPS. Quite a few stayed with USPS, finding UPS wasn’t the bargain they thought it was. As to the headache of standing in line for a package, that depends a lot on the LPO and the individual carrier. I’ve had carriers leave fairly large packages on a sopping wet driveway and fairly small packages held at the LPO. But I’ve rarely had to deal with long lines there. [Reply] Mike says: November 29, 2014 at 10:22 pm Floyd, take a 2nd think! You are obviously anti-USPS! I could tell you stories about white & brown! ALL carriers: brown, white, and red-white-blue, have their problems! And, exactly, where do you go to pick up that package that requires a signature from white or brown? Your U.S. Post Office is right there in your community and open. Have a problem with USPS? Call them and let them know. It is USPS policy to deliver those Amazon packages, and on Sundays in many communities. The USPS recognizes packages are their future. They are not perfect, but still provide a great service to us. [Reply] James Whitmore says: November 30, 2014 at 3:30 pm I am a rural mail carrier for the USPS who leaves parcels at doorsteps when they don’t fit in the mailbox – in addition, the recipient doesn’t have to be at home for me to leave the parcel at their doorstep – unless a signature is required. Other rural mail carriers at the post office where I work (Appleton, Wisconsin) follow the same procedure – we try to minimize trips to the post office whenever possible. I am sorry for your poor service and suggest that you contact your local postmaster, who hopefully will correct the problem. [Reply] Jerry says: November 30, 2014 at 6:32 pm First off, the USPS is the most economical way to ship packages. Second, the USPS services every home 6 days a week and is required by the postal regulatory committee. Third, the post office is actually is in the black 6 billion dollars because of its increase in parcel delivery. Forth, the post office provides free insurance and free tracking of your parcels which was a service that we charged for in the past. Maybe you outta get your facts straight before you bash the largest and oldest employer in the U.S.!!!! [Reply] Chris says: November 30, 2014 at 8:58 pm Every time that I have ordered from Amazon in the most recent past, it has been left at my doorstep by USPS. Packages have also arrived on-time or a day early. No issues in Chicago with needing to be picked up. [Reply] EMW Reply: January 19th, 2015 at 6:23 pm I feel the same. I have received all my packages on time with USPS. With UPS, I have to wait for one attempt for delivery, then let UPS know I want them to hold it, then travel to the UPS center across the river at limited times for pickup. I don’t dislike UPS or FedEx but I much rather USPS because it is more convenient. [Reply] Patricia Lynn says: November 30, 2014 at 10:46 pm I have the exact opposite opinion of this writer. My main concern is security. I DON’T want packages just left at the door, and that’s what UPS does. They either knock and immediately leave, or sometimes don’t even knock. I MUCH prefer having packages delivered to the apartment’s secure postal boxes, or having them delivered to my door by the USPS or any company OTHER THAN UPS, because none of them have ever just left a package outside my door where it might easily be stolen. I wish we were always allowed a choice of delivery method, because I would never choose UPS.

[Reply] Luke says: December 5, 2014 at 10:52 pm I agree with this article entirely. Amazon used to ship only small low cost items by Surepost and Smartpost.

Those who actually frequent real news sources, you know those that actually post sources or links to major announcements such as what you are claiming will know that Amazon is not carrier exclusive. During times of high volume such as Black Friday and Christmas Amazon will expand use of carriers they don’t typically utilize, such as the USPS. Another bonus is if you are a Prime customer and they are late delivering the package you can contact customer service (phone, live chat, and email work) and they will extend your Prime membership by a month or you may get a $10-15 credit to use. If you are not a prime member they will typically refund your shipping costs if it is late and shipped by Amazon. [Reply] Metatrox says: December 8, 2014 at 11:58 am I’m sooo disappointed with USPS. I signed up for prime primarily for the free 2 day shipping. USPS is not guaranteed! Thats not what I pay for! I cant count on them at all. I guess i’ll have to pay the extra for overnight in hopes to get it in 3 days or so! [Reply] Gallie says: December 9, 2014 at 3:26 pm Local USPS has a new contract w/Amazon to “leave if no response.” Several folks in my bldg have had their items stolen, just left on a doorstep on a weekend instead of a pick up at post office notice. [Reply] Joe Reply: December 18th, 2014 at 8:47 pm If you get a USPS account you can give delivery instructions on the tracking number page (eg authorize to leave with neighbor or custodian, put a hold on it etc.).

Customer service is great; if they make a mistake they usually give a gift card credit. Exchanges and returns are simple, just print the return label and drop off at a UPS Store. My packages arrive mostly by UPS still with an occasional FedEx. Since Prime is free two day shipping, if they don’t get it out of the warehouse in time, they overnight it FedEx at no extra charge to ensure I get it on the date promised.

I have delivered thousands of Amazon parcels, it’s a fantastic cooperation between UPS and USPS. They fly them to us and process them down to individual offices then drop them off for us to take out, which eliminates the outdated excuse that USPS ruins every parcel. Most of their parcels won’t fit in a standard mailbox, but that does not mean we take them back to the office. We get out and take them to wherever the customer asks to have their parcels placed, typically the door. I have yet to encounter a package from Amazon requiring a signature, but there really would be no difference between USPS and UPS in regards of a signature, if they aren’t there they get a notification which they can sign and put in their mailbox for re-delivery (something ups can’t do, since they can’t use our mailboxes) or go pick it up at the nearest location and, for rural customers especially, their post office is always closer than a ups facility. [Reply] Brian Reply: January 25th, 2015 at 1:32 am I also have delivered thousands of amazon packages to the door. And we deliver every package the day we get them. Even when UPS brings them late. And we deliver them on Sundays and holidays. And I have only seen one amazon package that required a signature. [Reply] Bill says: December 12, 2014 at 11:02 pm This article is clearly biased against USPS.. Maybe this guy has a lot of UPS stock? I am also a long time and frequent Amazon customer, and the recent change has actually improved my delivery. My UPS depot is on the other side of town, but I can walk to my post office. Also I have yet to have USPS not leave an Amazon package, but I have fought with UPS for years about why they won’t leave a package,. the surly attitude of their drivers, and the way they often smash packages. As much as I wish that Amazon would ditch UPS, I received Amazon packages in the last couple of days from UPS. I also get Fedex and Lasership delivery from Amazon, and have had only minor problems with all of them except UPS. [Reply] Gordon Reply: December 26th, 2014 at 11:27 am I haven’t ordered from Amazon since they switched to USPS but I don’t think they have gained anything. I have had packages delivered by UPS that it took a month to get them after UPS said it was delivered. It finally appeared out by the mailbox. In the mean time I let the vendor know and they sent me a replacement two times. I received 3 of the item before the first order was delivered. I never knew who had the first order. USPS puts the mail in the wrong mailbox until they are driving me crazy. A few days ago they delivered the neighbors mail to our mailbox. They have delivered our mail to neighbors a number of times. Once a check was delivered to a neighbor. It took a week for it to get to us. It had been opened and stapled through the check and the envelope to keep it in. Another time some medicine was delivered to one of the neighbors. Again it was opened before they gave it to us. I think the people delivering and the neighbors need to learn to read and stop opening our mail. [Reply] Michele says: December 13, 2014 at 10:26 pm Fact: Since Amazon signed the contract with the USPS, four (count them, four!) Amazon packages delivered to our Post Office box were immediately and without notification to us *returned* to Amazon as “undeliverable.” We have been Amazon Prime members since 2001. Amazon Customer Service was mortified. We have spoken numerous times to our post office staff, begging them not to do this, to simply do what they would do with any other package we receive (ie, put a notice in our box and we then pick it up). Each time they vacantly nod their head and say they will. Each time our Amazon (and ONLY Amazon) packages are returned without notice to us. And this time – the final straw – was all of the grandchildren’s Christmas presents. Amazon is trying to make up for the incompetence of the USPS by now noting on our account to ONLY deliver via FED EX or UPS to our doorstep. This contract needs to go. I’ve never seen a more worthless group of people. If this is a common occurrence, Amazon will drop them like a hot potato and the USPS will be a thing of the past. [Reply] Marc says: December 15, 2014 at 6:09 pm I’ve got the same problem that Gallie noticed – the reverse of everyone else here. The latest way Amazon is trying to thwart the problem of missed deliveries is to release the carrier from liability for items left on doorsteps. I live in the city in Baltimore, and have had numerous packages, including a $700 camera, stolen in the last couple of months. Unless you, or a worthy neighbor, see a package being left outside your house, it will be stolen in what I would guess to be a matter of seconds. Thieves just follow the mail carrier through town and their Christmas shopping is complete. Idiotic policy. Adding insult to injury, our lazy local mail carrier in Baltimore has since applied the Amazon philosophy to ALL packages being delivered. [Reply] Don Reply: January 3rd, 2015 at 10:46 am Yes, that is my experience in Baltimore too. Have discontinued using Amazon Prime because of its use of the USPS in the Baltimore area.

[Reply] samiup says: December 16, 2014 at 5:05 pm I have noticed a difference. and it is a significant one. USPS delivered my package at 3pm,-when i was at work- the notice they left did not say much, no re-delivery attempt… i went to their website in order to ask for re-delivery, USPS web site was not working as i could not pick up a date from the calendar tool after filling up a long form… Then i said, OK maybe ill just pick it up, their office closes at 4:00 pm… WOW! now what should i do now? take a half day off from work to go to USPS everything i order from Amazon? pretty pathetic. Called Amazon, asked for replacement. the item that was “delivered” will leave USPS and go back to Amazon in 15 days… [Reply] I Do Not Like USPS! says: December 20, 2014 at 2:33 pm Another argument against USPS that no one, it seems, noticed: USPS does its delivery run once a day. So, if package has arrived to your local USPS facility at, say, 12PM, but your postman starts delivery route to your street at 11:59AM, you’re out of luck – you will have to wait extra day for your package. UPS will run delivery routes several times a day, as long as there are packages to be delivered. [Reply] larry Reply: February 23rd, 2015 at 5:59 pm Maybe you have noticed that USPS delivers to every house on the route…not just parcels like ups, fedex. If we didnt…maybe we could make double runs. Also your carrier sorts and cases every piece of mail on his route as well as loading his vehicle. [Reply] Paul says: December 22, 2014 at 7:55 pm I have the same problem but I don’t blame UPS or USPS. If I have a guaranteed delivery date for the 24th and I’m told UPS will have it delivered then. I then find out it’s not to me but my post office and I won’t receive several items until the 26th. I called UPS and they said that’s how it is . Guarantee date by them but not USPS. This is all back on Amazon on how they ship now. I didn’t know this and I have been buying part of my Christmas items from them for awhile.

[Reply] Richard says: December 26, 2014 at 8:31 pm Thank you, Mr. Brown, for bringing up this subject. And for those that are getting front door delivery of your mail and parcels from the USPS, I am happy for you. We moved into a neighborhood with new housing during the early part of this summer where front door delivery by the USPS is not available, by design. Instead, mail and parcels are delivered to a mailbox/parcel container clusters located at selected street intersections. I suppose it saves time and money for the USPS to do it this way. If there are no parcel containers vacant or if the package is over sized for the container, the USPS wont leave it, but will leave a notice in the mailbox to have it picked up. We tried several times to have them redeliver packages, but the problem of parcel container vacancies or package size also determine whether the attempt to redeliver is successful or not. When Amazon was shipping by UPS or FedEx, we would always get our packages delivered to the house, always. Now, we get about 30% of our packages if shipped via USPS. We’ve been Prime Members since 2004, and since October, we have substantially cut down our ordering from Amazon because of their heavy use of the USPS as shipper of 90% of our orders. Amazon should give shoppers the option of which carrier to use in order to work around obstacles like mail box clusters. [Reply] Tasha Miles says: December 28, 2014 at 1:22 am Amen to this author!! I too have been one of Amazon’s Number One Fans since early years. I also order all our small business supplies from them to the tune of 30K+ Per year. USPS is a disaster for me because we live on a rural route and we never get packages delivered to the door. This results in a trip to the post office which is 15 miles away and not well run. I can’t find a solution through Amazon. I’m willing to pay more and /or wait longer for my packages JUST DON’T USE USPS! .. but there is no way to opt out. Why a “can do” company like Amazon pairs up with a “can’t do and don’t want to try to do” government agency like the USPS is beyond my understanding. The results were predictable without having an MBA. [Reply] Calvin says: January 9, 2015 at 3:07 pm My problem isn’t so much that they are using the postal service (live an an area where we have the combined mailboxes), it is that they have increased the cost of Prime and are using a cheaper service altogether (USPS). For me it seems like they are trying to boost revenue and at the same time decrease costs. My Prime membership is about to end this January and I do not plan on renewing. $20 price increase for cheaper USPS package deliveries… no thank you. I can wait a few extra days with all the non-primies.

[Reply] Nick says: January 16, 2015 at 6:58 pm I’m not sure where the author lives, but at my house the USPS carrier places letters in the mailbox at the end of my driveway and packages on my front porch. Granted, I live in the suburbs and not a gigantic apartment building, but still the article is very misleading. The only time I’ve had to go to the post office to pick up a package is when a signature is required and I wasn’t home when USPS attempted to deliver. UPS and USPS are both really good about taking a note with my signature on it and leaving a signature required package as well. FedEx on the other hand is awful. They actually refuse to deliver a package early. Let me explain: say a seller uses ups ground to ship a parcel, that service has a 5 day guarantee. Many times it gets to the customer in 2-3 days, everyone is happy in this instance. Well, very recently I had that very thing happen with fedex, except those crooks actually held my package at a processing center for THREE DAYS before finally delivering it. I saw this on the tracking system with the message “package not scheduled for delivery today”, so I called their customer service department and my god were they awful. They could not have cared less, seriously. I even said that USPS and ups would never do something like this. Her response “well that’s our policy”, justifying NOT delivering it “early” and holding it to deliver on the 5th day. Fedex is also not good at all for working around “signature required” restrictions. I once left a note saying it was ok to leave the package at the door and provided my signature and telephone number, only to come home to a snippy “we missed you” flyer with “must get sig in person” written in pen on it. That fedex “smartpost” someone else mentioned (where fedex does the work from origin to destination city, then hands off to USPS for delivery) is another awful set up. That can often end up being a 8 day service in my experience. Needless to say I’d rather drive to pick up my purchase from the origin than be forced to use fedex again! [Reply] EMW says: January 19, 2015 at 5:56 pm This article is incorrect. The USPS has left several packages at my door. I have not had to go to the USPS to get a package.

Unfortunately for me, my employer also has a P.O. box so now that USPS is being used, instead of delivering to the street address they mark all my packages as delivered and put them in the P.O. box room and isn’t physically delivered to me until the third day. Therefore, I pay the Prime fee but don’t get the 2 day shipping as promised. [Reply] TC says: February 16, 2015 at 7:06 am USPS is far better than UPS.

The postal service will not deliver to my door since I live inside a gated community and the USPS’s carrier union contract doesn’t require them to deliver inside the gate, so any parcel that won’t fit inside the small parcel boxes must be picked up from the post office — a 45 minute round trip. Super frustrating! I’ve started breaking up my orders into 1 thing at a time — sometimes one in the morning and one in the evening — to try to keep boxes as small as possible with hopes they’ll fit inside the parcel locker. Plus, I figure it costs Amazon a heck of a lot more by making them ship each item individually, so maybe they’ll reconsider allowing their customers to select their own carriers.

Then your lucky if you ever receive item.Next your left proving it didn’t get delivered and good luck with that USPS has no system in place to make sure carriers deliver package. I just had to go to Post Office to file a complaint about 4 packages that say delivered but weren’t. Well guess what they found all 4 in carriers truck in a bag with many other packages from up to a week ago that weren’t delivered. She had been fired they said and it looked like the packages were going to be taken home. No way to know how many end up in dumpsters or worse. [Reply] larry Reply: February 23rd, 2015 at 5:45 pm Packages left in vehicle would be found the next day. I believe you made this up. Also postal management will scan parcels left in office as attempted because the clerks missthrow them and the carriers are instructed to leave them in a tub or on floor by supervisors desk before they leave. These packages may not be delivered until the next day. Try not to blame everything on your carrier especially if you don’t take the time to get to no them as your carrier. [Reply] Ace21 says: February 27, 2015 at 1:58 pm I am fed up with Amazon because of this. What used to take a few days to deliver a package now takes 1-2 WEEKS. Reason being is my UPS location is in a city 30 miles away. Yesterday, a package arrived at UPS, great, should be out for delivery that day. NOPE. Already gone through this once, I immediately contacted UPS so I could drive over and pick up the package. I was told NO, they are required to turn the package over to the Post Office in the city, which then sits on the package for a few more days ‘sorting it’ to be shipped to the Post Office in the city I live in. Once that finally happens, my local post office then sits on it for another day or 2 ‘sorting’ it, all the while the Post Office is telling Amazon the package has been delivered. EVERY SINGLE PACKAGE I have ordered that came USPS has stated ‘delivered’ when checked online at least 1-2 days BEFORE the package is actually delivered. Today, I just looked, and the post office is stating package is delivered, yet, it is still sitting in a post office in a different city from which I live in. No more Amazon for me if this is the service I can come to expect. I will pay a few more dollars to buy items as local as possible and if they have to be shipped, USPS will NEVER be an option for me as they are the absolute worst shippers I have ever experienced (of course that will vary city to city, but mine is terrible). [Reply] Tom says: February 28, 2015 at 1:32 pm My problem is that for large packages, my local USPS has been claiming “delivery attempted” even though I’m certain this did not happen. Twice in three weeks (original and replacement order) for a large (28 lb bag of dog food) package this has occurred. I was at home both times and there’s no way I (or my dog) missed any doorbell, nor were there any notices. I requested redelivery and the package goes into la la land both times (“delivery status not updated”). IMO this is Amazon’s responsibility. I have to go to the post office to pick it up, I might as well just go to the store. For example, I work for an IT company that provides web hosting services but we outsource to other data centers for the physical hosting. I can’t tell my customers “oh, your site is down, please call the data center”. I take responsibility for the vendors I choose, and Amazon must as well. [Reply] Kyle says: March 4, 2015 at 12:07 pm The business decision Amazon made is one of simple economics (short-sighted, but simple). Of the three major players (UPS, FedEx, and USPS), only one has no shareholders to answer to so that’s the only one willing to lose money on every delivery. Experience with all of these carriers depends, primarily, on the individual people involved (the driver for your route / your mail carrier). If you have a good one (I used to), then you might not even notice that Amazon made that decision. If you have a bad one (I do now), you’ll consider Amazon’s decision to be a bad one. The other difference in the carriers is that you have no recourse with USPS. My USPS carrier frequently scans the package as delivered even though he never even drives down my street (e.g., snow on the ground and no tracks whatsoever). Frequent trips to the PO have only created discord, not solutions. Sometimes my USPS carrier ends up delivering the package in another day or two, sometimes I never get it. Taking it up with the merchant is of no use because the tracking information shows it’s been delivered so I appear to be the liar. I continue to look for online merchants that ship via UPS or FedEx (without handing off to USPS). It’s becoming more and more difficult to find these because – as I stated originally, no one can delivery cheaper than the one who’s willing to lose money on every delivery. [Reply] Nevada says: March 8, 2015 at 12:31 pm Living in rural Nevada, I find USPS services to be the best option for me. USPS does not deliver to my house due to my choice in location, so I head to the Post Office daily. Using a PO Box means I know when I will get my mail and if I have a package a key is left in my box. That key is numbered and used to open a larger package box in the same area. I don’t want things left at the front door of my house. I want them inside dry and safe. Maybe instead of expecting free services from USPS people should purchase the use of a PO Box? There are no lines to pick up mail and it can be convenient. I’ve had really bad experiences with home delivery which included packages being left at the wrong house with Fedex and UPS and Ontrac (being the worst!). However, out of all three UPS is much better in following up with mistakes, but to pick up a package at their shipping department means a 45 min drive (one way) for me! I dislike ordering from companies that use anything but USPS and from my perspective, Amazon made the right choice. [Reply] will says: March 10, 2015 at 10:52 pm USPS leaves packages on the street here. They are too lazy to bring it to the front door. So we’ve had lots of packages disappear. Most frustrating is that we spend a huge some of money on an extra large locked delivery box, and they still are too lazy to open the door (its one way) and place it inside. Maddening.

Recently, I have had to return a computer case I purchased on Amazon THREE TIMES due to shipping damage caused by UPS employees. This is not an uncommon occurrence for me when I get packaged via UPS. I’ve never had a package damaged or late that was delivered by USPS. Full disclosure: I lean RIGHT, political views have nothing to do with it. [Reply] Rev.

Ordered a two-day package that I needed as a gift and expected it on Friday. When I got home, happily awaiting the package.. all I got was a pink slip telling me to go f myself. I threw the pink slip away and waited for it to be returned to Amazon and instead got another gift at the store. The post office is open 9-5 (I’m at work 8-5, an hour away) and then open saturdays 9-1, which meant I either use my sleep-in day to get there early, or suffer the wrath of a dreadfully long and painful wait at the Brooklyn USPS office. NO THANKS! RETURNED! And this will happen to every package that I get with a pink slip. I hate the post office. Especially in NYC.

Troy says: March 25, 2015 at 6:15 pm I literally got off the phone with the USPS about this situation. I live in an apartment complex in a small town in the country. I ordered something from Amazon on Monday, with free 2-day Prime shipping. I was home sick today from work – perfect, I’ll be here to receive the package. About an hour ago (3PM), the tracking said “attempted delivery by USPS, notice left” at 9:30AM. What? I was here – no one attempted delivery. Plus, the notice that was left in my mailbox (not until 3:30PM) had the back crossed out – they won’t deliver even if I gave them permission to! Now, I have to wait until Saturday to get to the post office (they are open from 9AM – 5PM Monday – Friday…hmmm, right during my work hours too). To me, that’s laziness on the part of the carrier. Not the first time this has happened, and if I would have known they were using USPS to deliver, I would have spent the extra money and bought it at the store. [Reply] Al Day says: March 26, 2015 at 6:15 pm My experience is just the opposite. USPS delivers to my door while UPS will not deliver at all to my location. Packages delivered by the postal service are usually in better condition than those delivered by UPS when they used to deliver here. So I don’t agree with the synopsis of issues in this article. Amazon now has all their UPS shipments to me going back which tends to piss them off. In time they will just give us a choice or lose our business. All vendors should offer choice so whoever is best where you are can deliver for you. It should never be the vendors choice. I’m willing to pay extra to have FedEx or USPS deliver all my stuff. No more UPS for me. [Reply] Kyle says: April 3, 2015 at 7:46 pm I’ve made over 70 orders from Amazon in the past 6 months, them switching to USPS is a dream come true. I don’t live in an apartment any more, but generally only USPS carriers can easily get into most apartments, which is an enormous plus right there. UPS drivers will often just leave notices without even ringing the bell if it’s not safe for them to throw your packages all the way from the curb to your door. Tampering with legitimate mail is a serious offense, but petty theft if UPS/FedEx; consider the implications for packages that are obviously from Amazon. Finally, I feel like people complain about post offices like they do the DMV – have you ever actually been to one? Mine is huge and beautiful, and there’s rarely much of a line. I know not all of these things will apply to everyone but there’s not much to complain about with regards to the USPS unless you’re a crazy libertarian or something. [Reply] Larry says: April 4, 2015 at 12:16 am I’ve noticed this trend lately myself. I live in an apartment building in NYC and am not always home, but UPS would usually be kind enough to leave my Amazon packages with my neighbors, or at the least attempt re-delivery. USPS? Pink slip for pickup the very first day, without so much as a buzz through the intercom. I’ve missed several packages when I was actually at home because the delivery person wouldn’t take the time to notify me. Then I usually have to wait until the weekend to pick them up, only to be forced to wait in line for 45 minutes. On top of it all the employees at the local post office are rude and sarcastic, and actually raise their voices at the customers. I’ve already started shopping locally to avoid the dreadful post office, or I order items from Amazon that I know will fit inside my mail box (which they don’t always leave in there anyway). And the Amazon Dash button, you’ve got to be kidding me, who in their right mind would wait 45 minutes in line to pick up paper towels when they could spend 5 min for $1 more, or sometimes even pay less? Sure those dollars add up, but so do the 45 min. Would you rather have spent 5 hours and 40 minutes picking up paper towels over the course of a year, or $12?

There have been a few times I had to wait an extra day because I wasn’t home when the package arrived. But mostly I just have things shipped to my office – which is open 7 days a week. To be honest, I feel that Amazon’s deal with the USPS has added value to my Prime membership. Sure they might have kinks to workout, but I think it’s a good thing in the long and short run. [Reply] Vandy Reply: April 7th, 2015 at 8:15 pm I’ve noticed many fewer products are being allowed to go to Amazon Lockers, at least in my case. I order lots of business supplies, books, and clothes through Amazon, and stuff that usually goes to a Locker now must come to either my home address or my P.O. box. Fortunately, I already have a P.O. box in my city and I go once a week on Saturday mornings (if I’m in town) when the lines aren’t that long. We have a separate line in my P.O. branch for picking up packages ONLY. Doesn’t mean it’s not a long line, but it’s separate from regular window services. I don’t want to see the USPS go under. It’s an institution that should be allowed to run and I’m 100% against privatization contracts that the capitalists like Obama are proposing and now sticking us with, such as they just signed with Staples. Staples employees are not fit to run a Post Office. But then I’m a communist. Never underestimate the hypocrisy of capitalists, though. They’d sell their own mothers for a quarter. It’s hilarious to see them complaining about, well, capitalist practices! Carry on cappies! [Reply] Robert says: April 11, 2015 at 4:08 am I used to buy everything at Amazon. I cancelled my prime membership and don’t use them anymore since they switched to USPS final leg delivery. USPS is a joke. They don’t deliver packages to my house because it has a long driveway. I’ve met USPS at the street and they hand me a ‘We attempted to deliver your package” notice. To top it off, the notice always says I can pick it up the next day at the post office, but 80% of the time they don’t have it ready so I usually have to wait 2 days after the ‘guaranteed’ delivery date. Also, this is a way for FedEx and UPS to offload costs onto taxpayers. As is usual with corporate-government corruption, profits go up, service goes down. Screw all these hucksters. [Reply] Terie says: April 13, 2015 at 1:36 pm For those of you complaining – I complained too. But, I took my complaints to Amazon and they put in my account to NEVER transfer any of my packages to the post office. Once they made that notation, I have not had any further issues with the 2 day shipping. Nothing is taken to the Post Office anymore. I now have to give that information to all of the companies that are doing this. I hate seeing that my package will be delivered a certain day and then discover it won’t be for another day because it was sent to USPS. Then it takes at least another 2 -3 days. Unacceptable. That is why USPS gets no business! [Reply] Sean says: April 17, 2015 at 5:12 am I would like to say that yes, the postal service has terrible customer service in my city. I worked as a carrier for all of one month after graduation from University, and the structure and idiocy of my local post office made it impossible for any educated or markedly skilled employees to remain there for any amount of time and keep their sanity. My “manager” called me every 10 minutes on my cell phone while I was out making amazon deliveries, causing me to be slower than needed to make these deliveries (yes, to the front porch.) The carriers that I was hired along with tried hard to get the mail delivered on time and correctly, but the constant berating from management to “go faster!!!” resulted in most people either cutting corners or quitting after a couple weeks. The system in place is setup for the idiots to eventually take charge, while the hard workers end up finding more lucrative work elsewhere. This all shows in the service that customers receive from their post office nowadays. I bet most of the people who are now having problems with their mail had no problems 10 years ago, and this is a result of the current system of allowing the inmates to run the asylum. The post office is a case study in what not to do as a company, how not to treat your employees, and how not to treat your customers. It is lunacy and idiocy at its finest and I don’t expect to see it around 10 years from now if they don’t make some serious changes in management. Amazon is backing the wrong horse in the name of profit, but they are only hurting themselves in the long run. The Post office is not capable of keeping it’s promises to Amazon.

Everytime I have order, UPS delivers my packages and they have always been early. They will just leave them on my doorstep, or sometimes they will deliver in the evenings when I am home, so I accept them in person. My local UPS driver is polite, friendly, and is always on time. I have received packages via USPS before, and I have to leave a note on the mail box to give them permission to leave my bigger packages on my porch. I don’t know if this is the case for any of you, but I’m not sure if they are allowed to leave packages without permission. I have ran into this before and now always leave a note when I am expecting something via USPS so that the post person knows what I want.

My experience has been a little different, as they still left the bigger boxes outside my door step. Atleast the good part is that Amazon has joined hands with a sinking business and hope this helps USPS employees from losing their jobs. [Reply] miguel says: May 3, 2015 at 9:26 am USPS has time and time again missed my 2day delivery dead line. The tracking always says its out for delivery but never arrives that day. Then they update the tracking saying I wasn’t home but they never left the sticky note on my door which means they never even attempted. Then the post office holds my package for a day and attempts to redeliver the following day. So 2 day delivery turns into 4 day. This is the gunhill road post office in the Bronx. The employees there don’t care about their job and delivering on time. I run a business and use amazon prime as a means of getting my supplies. But without reliable delivery times I’m starting to question if i should find alternative means. When my packages get shipped via FedEx or UPS I never have an issue. But more and more they are using USPS. Bad move amazon. There’s a reason why nobody uses them. Shouldn’t your partnerships be strong ones? This is a step backwards and a bad business move. [Reply] phototristan says: May 6, 2015 at 1:28 am USPS consistently forgets to deliver Amazon packages and never even leaves a notice. I have to manually try tracking it to find out that is at the post office and I have to then go pick it up. Most of the time, the driver just doesn’t feel like delivering the box and it sits in the truck. So many times, I’ve been home only to not receive the package and track it online later only to find out they say ‘attempted delivery, notice left’ to cover their own butt. In reality, they did not attempt any delivery nor did they even leave a notice for me. I’ve also try their online redelivery service with shoddy results. Sometimes, they don’t even redeliver. Last Christmas, they even lost a package from Amazon. USPS has completely flakey service, terrible customer service and no follow through for the actual delivering of shipments! I recommend everyone reading complain to Amazon about USPS’s terrible service. This is the only way they can begin to realize how bad USPS is.

Amazon has been a lifeline for those of us in rural areas, but the Postal Service leaves packages OUT ON TOP OF OUR RURAL MAIL BOX, and a few times, on the ground in torrents of rain, so most of the time, it’s either destroyed or stolen.

[Reply] Judy says: June 1, 2015 at 10:35 am So I ordered something on Thursday, and the package was to be delivered on Friday (overnight delivery). My package was scanned to Brooklyn, NY 11214 where I leave on Friday morning, and then was sent to NY, NY 10014, then NY, NY 10199 and than to Brooklyn, NY 11256 (this all happened between Friday and Sunday), finally this morning my package was scanned at Brooklyn, NY 11214 my area code and I am still waiting for delivery. I wasted a beautiful Saturday stuck at home waiting for this package which was already late, because of course it could not possibly show up more than 24 hrs late (wrong). The last ten packages which I had delivered to work where handed off to my mail room a full 24 hours after the package was marked delivered. I will not be renewing my prime membership if they do not move back to using UPS. Amazon was great and refunded my shipment. Gave me a $5 credit toward a future purchase, and then extended my membership by one month.

Problem is the mailboxes for the development are in a room that locks at 7pm daily and isn’t open on Sunday’s. What this means for me is that I no longer get my Amazon prime items delivered to my door. And if I can’t make it to the mailroom by 7 (I work 12 hr shifts) I won’t get my prime items for days!!. I asked the postal delivery person to please deliver Amazon items to my house. I got a VERY Stern no, that is what the larger mailboxes are in the mail room. Postmaster said the same thing. No we WON’T deliver to your house. When my prime expires, I won’t be renewing. Amazon has lost my business.

If you get a slip just go online and request redelivery [Reply] John Reply: September 29th, 2015 at 12:39 am Requesting redelivery does nothing. My USPS carrier is refusing to deliver packages he deems too heavy. I know this because of the last package he refused to deliver. I filed a complaint and they fessed up that he said the package was too heavy, but still refused to deliver it. Which is odd, because normal carriers like UPS or FedEx use things like hand carts to move around heavy packages. I also doubt the women at the front desk of the post office are going to move the package around any easier than the postal carrier could. Funny how the front desk staff at the post office have to move the heavy package around, but the actual carrier doesn’t. So on this latest package, Saturday(2 days ago), the carrier lied and claimed there was no secure place to deliver on the delivery slip. Of course I had two USPS packages scheduled for delivery on Saturday. The heavy one was not delivered at around 8am, just the slip was left. The lighter one was delivered around 2 and left on my porch without issue. So much for a lack of a secure location. I filed for redelivery for today and instead of getting my package the status on Amazon updated to “Sorry, your package is delayed because of an issue with the carrier.” Even when the carrier gets called out, they still feel comfortable refusing to deliver packages. Very nice job security, you can’t get fired for refusing to do your job. I know I am never going to see that package from Amazon, it was prime pantry, so maybe Amazon will do something since they want prime pantry to work. Last time they resent the heavy item and laughably it was resent with USPS when Amazon said they would put a note on the order to use a different carrier. But it got delivered on a Sunday and I think they have different people delivering on Sunday, so that time the carrier left it on my porch. With USPS it is simply up to the carrier. Some people have carriers that deliver anything and some people have carriers that refuse to deliver everything. It is hit or miss. I filed a complaint about the fact that the carrier lied by saying there was no secure location, at the very least if the carrier is refusing to deliver because the item is too heavy, they need to put that real reason the delivery slip so Amazon knows it is a carrier issue. It is annoying to have to explain this to Amazon when Amazon’s system is telling them there was no secure location, it makes the customer(me) look bad. USPS should not be lying on these delivery slips. So that is where I am. I can only get light packages from Amazon. If anything is heavy and comes via USPS, there are no guarantees I will get it. My only question is how long will Amazon let me order before they just kick me off despite the fact that they are the ones who chose the carrier? [Reply] Boss Reply: October 8th, 2015 at 9:49 pm Any carrier, regardless of the company they work for should be instantly terminated for refusing to deliver a package. Job description shows up to 70 lbs lifting. If carrier has some sort of disability or restrictions other qualified employee should deliver your package. If your postmaster does not take care of this problem call the Senate. You will see a difference. Shame on anyone out there who works and does not care about customers. You are customer as well and treat people way you want to be treated unless you are real JERK. Sorry but it is what it is!

I can’t even see it’s there plus anyone driving the road can just stop and steal it. A lot of stuff has gotten wet and been ruined. I’m elderly and am unable to walk or drive to my box and have to wait for relatives to pick stuff up for me. It’s very unkind as I’ve known the mailman all his life. Guess he doesn’t care. [Reply] dave Reply: September 22nd, 2015 at 12:51 am Nikki, you can request your mail and packages be delivered to your door because of health reasons. We have folks who are disabled or aged who we will go right up the driveway and deliver to your house everyday. There is a form to be filled out from your postmaster, but when approved we do what is called a dismount, and bring mail to you so you do not have to go to mailbox. Hopefully this helps! [Reply] Boss Reply: October 8th, 2015 at 9:42 pm Nikki, Rural Letter Carrier should never leave box hanging on the post or your mailbox. If you are less than half mile away from the box package should be delivered to your door unless can fit in the box. If your carrier does not care, consumer affair cares. Also, like Tom said get letter from your doctor and all your mail, (not just packages) will and should be delivered to your door. It is called HARDSHIP and can not be denied. [Reply] Tom says: July 3, 2015 at 10:35 pm I am a letter carrier in Spokane, Washington with 28 years experience. In the last year and a half we have seen a huge increase in Amazon packages, and exactly a year ago we started delivering Amazon on Sunday, using temp carriers. Now that nearly every package has a tracking barcode, it has become painful for us to not give good, on-time service, because if we don’t, the supervisor may hear about it on the phone, then the carrier will hear it, and no one likes to hear customer complaints, especially from the people that we serve and interact with every day. Our scanners now upload instantly, and customers can go to the website and track their packages in real time. One of the strengths of the ol’ post office is the national forwarding system. It is not uncommon for someone who has recently moved, to order a package from Amazon or eBay, for example, and forget to give them their new address, resulting in the package going to the postal unit that delivers to their old address. (I see this happen every month.) It takes a few extra days, and there might be a forwarding charge, but it does usually get forwarded, whereas if UPS or FedEx get such a package, they will deliver it erroneously and then will probably get to go pick it up again (if the new people give it back), and return it. I have nothing against UPS or FedEx. They have their respective strengths as well. UPS rates are much higher than USPS rates for packages under ten pounds. There seems to be a large percentage of the public who don’t notice that when they ship via UPS, UPS takes its profit and then farms the package out to USPS to deliver at the lower rate. From the viewpoint of UPS, this looks like a really good deal. From the viewpoint of customers, it does not look like a good deal, or it should not, anyway. The problem with all delivery companies is that they use people to do the work. Not all people care about the customers they serve. I certainly do, and want to give the best service possible every day to everyone on my route. We just heard an inside word that Amazon is about to terminate using FedEx and UPS for the most part and use mostly USPS. This will cause some problems with people who use P.O. boxes for their mail, and it will be interesting to see how this is solved. [Reply] Stephen Walsh says: July 20, 2015 at 1:03 pm I’ve accepted the fact that I will never receive an Amazon package delivered via USPS on a Sunday. My local post office uses the tactic of saying they delivered it in the system so Amazon thinks it was delivered on Sunday, but the package isn’t placed on my doorstep until the following day. [Reply] Melinda Miller says: August 3, 2015 at 8:19 pm To the hardworking dedicated postal workers who have posted, thank-you for your excellent commitment to service. However, I believe it does matter where you live whether you get good USPS service or not. UPS and FedEx have the same issues. If the Postmaster of the local post office don’t care and follow-up issues and complaints, why should the delivery personnel care? There are lazy people in all businesses. You may think people are crazy with some of their complaints of non-delivery but they really do happen exactly the way they say they do. I ordered something for my daughter and it went “out for delivery” never to be seen again. The next thing I mailed noted out for delivery on a Monday and a tag for postage due showed up in her box on Friday, she works from home. A letter posted to her in her state took 5 business days to arrive. She can go 3 days without any mail and then get a large pile. I, on the other hand have excellent mail service. People make the difference in the service, not the organization. [Reply] Lee says: August 9, 2015 at 10:00 pm Well I just got my first taste of the awesome USPS /Amazon partnership! Three different deliveries show as “delivered” to “front porch/door” on the USPS tracking site, but not one package on my porch and I have been home all day doing work around the house, I would have either heard the door or have seen the packages (in fact I believe I was walking my dog right out front at the time!). USPS service has been poor in my area, lots of mis-delivered mail and they have lost two “priority” packages of mine in the last few year. And as others have noted, they are a unaccountable. It’s bad news for Amazon, the biggest reason of all I have been such a huge customer is the shipping. I like the fact you can see the date something will be delivered and know you can count on it. I’m willing pay extra sometimes for a product just so I can have the ease and confidence of shipping. The author is correct, they made a deal with the devil and have destroyed their core competency by teaming up with worst delivery service on earth. [Reply] Randy K says: August 20, 2015 at 11:01 am The USPS is responsible enough to ensure that your package isn’t stolen, and according to this “article” that’s bad for the customer? If the customer leaves a not for the mailman that says “Please leave all packages at back door” or a similar note, then the package will be left there. This was obviously written by a UPS employee that feels threatened. A strong Post Office is good for the American people. UPS has to make a profit to keep their shareholders happy, they don’t care about the customer only the bottom line. For the Post Office, the customer IS the shareholder so they have an incentive to make the customer happy. Does UPS deliver to every house? NO, they only want the high profit stops. How about the Post Office? YES, it’s called “universal service” and is protected by the US constitution. As far as the false statement about the “Dead Letter Office” that’s total B.S., mail only goes there if it cannot be returned to sender because there is not return address on the package. [Reply] Matt says: September 22, 2015 at 10:44 pm I found this thread because of the huge problems I’ve been having with USPS and Amazon. The packages get in a weird place where they never arrive anywhere, they leave Amazon never to be seen again. Fortunately, Amazon has been good and sent the items next-day FedEx (when I ALWAYS get them!) Can’t be cheap for Amazon! In fact, last time, they even comped the item and sent it next day. I think Amazon is starting to see the light. USPS is having problems. My magazines were always a few days late (weekly magazines). Now they are weeks late. Sometimes multiple weeks of a weekly magazine will show up at the same time. [Reply] Boss says: October 8, 2015 at 9:23 pm With respect to all of you, I have to disagree for some of the issues. In Rural America USPS is still best option to get packages whether from Amazon, Ebay, or anyone else in the world. Billions of packages are being processed trough different distribution USPS facilities. Every package dropped to local Post Offices have to be delivered same day. Also Holiday and Sundays delivery are available. Amazon premium packages are delivered by unmarked vehicles mostly rental and these guys are blowing up stop signs and traffic lights like crazy. Worst and dangerous delivery services ever. When it comes to magazines again is distribution facility. If you have problem with USPS you should not post it here; call consumer affair, Congress or Senate Offices and your problem will be solved 100%. No one likes to have bad feedback but Amazon delivery packages are bad for customers not for USPS. USPS is still most trusted federal agency. All USPS employee went to extended background check. Best wishes and better delivery to all of US. [Reply] schnauzer says: October 27, 2015 at 2:44 pm I have a one for all of you. I ordered an item that was supposed to be delivered on Sunday, 10/25/2015. Well, it never made it, but that is par for the course when the USPS is involved. So I waited to see if it would arrive late. Today the USPS truck pulls into our driveway, and the driver TELLS ME she delivered it Sunday, to the WRONG address; then she asks me, if I eventually received it ok. While Amazon isn’t the problem here, the USPS is. I went in and cancelled all my future orders with Amazon, and I will buy from whatever website, or local retailer, where I don’t have to deal with USPS. Imagine that, delivered to WRONG address, the the USPS drivers ASKS ME if I received it ok. Hey – who is the delivery person here, anyway?! [Reply] Clinton Dawkins says: November 21, 2015 at 3:37 pm Bad info. The post office would be financially strong if they weren’t held to pension prepayments that no company is required to do. [Reply] Sammy says: November 29, 2015 at 9:44 pm I used to love Amazon. I have purchased over 800 orders from them over the last 10 years. USPS is so terrible. I have had numerous packages lost this year. I got 100% refunds, but it is such a pain now that I would prefer to have guaranteed commercial shipper NOT USPS. [Reply] Samuel says: December 2, 2015 at 2:24 pm Sorry to hear about your deliveries… I’m a carrier at USPS and I deliver all my packages day-of. And if they aren’t home I will text the customer and ask if it’s ok to leave with a neighbor or on their back porch. I notice the new help we hired really seems to bring back a lot of packages and mark them “dog.” Umm, bro, they don’t have a dog… [Reply] Doug D says: December 4, 2015 at 8:48 pm OK So I go to the Amazon Website, Purposely pay more for an item because it says if you want it tomorrow order within the next 3 hours and pick next day delivery. Pay extra for the delivery and then the next day they show estimated arrival of By 8:00PM. At the same time and on the same page there is no tracking info and they sow it as being in process of shipping. I chat with their rep at 3:00PM and am told the item is on the way and will arrive at 8:00PM (Note: My office closes at 5:00PM) so I wait for the item to arrive. At 8:18 no delivry, no update on the website so I chat with the again and am told it is in the warehouse being prepared for shipment?? I ask when it will arrive and they do not know?? I think Amazon has gotten too big and is forgetting who their customers are and how to treat them. I asked that all of my pending orders be cancelled as I will source my items alsewhere and was told they could only cancel two of five and guess what. The one item I’m waiting for is not one of them??? [Reply] Doug D says: December 4, 2015 at 8:52 pm USPS has made every excuse in the world not to deliver. They lost a printer (obviously it was stolen). They claimed my address did not exist?? When calling the postmaster about the address issue I was told “It was the Amazon Driver” Yes, the special Amazon delivery person that works for the USPS…? I’ve been told of delivery attempts that never happened as you don’t come near my house without my dogs barking. USPS has tried to stick me with Postage Due… Bad Move, Amazon. [Reply] Me says: December 5, 2015 at 11:28 pm This year every freaking UPS package has had issue and been delayed. They got re-scanned and delayed one business day when they showed out for delivery at 6am (NW Houston) all my USPS packages have been early or on time. Every now and then they put small packages in my mailbox. Most the time they drop them at my front door ring or knock at the door. Not sure why you guys are having issues with USPS but it’s services has been better than UPS for me. [Reply] Me Reply: December 7th, 2015 at 10:57 pm UPS just delayed again out for delivery. I was home all day working, they never showed up and went back to the center again. No reason listed, just delayed. UPS is crap. [Reply] Wayne in NC says: December 11, 2015 at 7:12 pm I need to say I have never worked for USPS and neither has any member of my family or any friends. I detested SmartPost and SurePost where UPS or FedEx turned over packages to USPS for delivery because the packages were usually late. Of course, I am an Amazon Prime member and have been since it was introduced. For the last year USPS has delivered almost all of our Amazon packages (there have been over 200). Everyone has been either on time or early. The postal delivery person brings packages to our front door if hey do not fit in our mailbox. They also deliver on Saturday AND Sunday. USPS has been at least as reliable as UPS with our Amazon Prime deliveries. Even large and heavy package are delivered to our front door on time by USPS. I have not been a fan of USPS for many years and I doubt whether the service needs to exist at all. But I must give them credit for their 100% on time delivery of over 200 Amazon Prime packages during the last year. They have also delivered packages from other online store on time 100% of the time. [Reply] JW says: December 12, 2015 at 6:02 pm This situation is also very bad for me as the USPS does not deliver to my address. This is what I see when I try to track a package from Amazon that gets transferred to USPS. But the address isn’t incorrect. The USPS just doesn’t deliver to it. UPS and FedEx deliver to it though. 9:05 AM Undeliverable – Incorrect Address Elgin, TX, US 7:04 AM Package arrived at a carrier facility Elgin, TX 6:23 AM Package has been transferred to the USPS and will be delivered by your local postal office Elgin, TX 2:43 AM Shipment departed from Amazon facility San Antonio, TX, US [Reply] Greg A says: December 23, 2015 at 3:19 pm I live in West metro Atlanta and since they started using the USPS more, I’m ordering A LOT less from Amazon! Our postal delivery in my area is nearly third-world level. Horrible drivers and delivery people. It’s common for stuff to be delivered very late (5:30pm+) if you’re lucky – on some days, my street gets no mail delivery at all. I for sure am NOT going to be renewing my Prime membership. [Reply] Mark says: December 25, 2015 at 10:49 pm UPS is the worst company and their employees that work in the hubs have worked Sundays for years and been away from their families for years because of the Amazon volume which UPS handles less than adequately both in delivery and the treatment of packages. The best thing for Amazon would be to leave UPS for good! [Reply] Puddy says: December 26, 2015 at 4:32 pm I have stopped using Amazon. I lived on a private road and usps does not travel on private roads. We did get one delivery to our door 2 years ago. The postal lady was complaining because she said usps signed a contract with Amazon that 2 day was 2 day, even on a private road. They must have Un-signed it because I thought it would neat to have some bulk items sent to our door 2 weeks later. I got a slip in our kiosk and had to make a 40 mile round trip to pick up my package. Also, if you notice, in rural areas, postal employees have to use their own cars. They use the smallest and most economical so half the time a big package won’t even fit in their car. And to think the post office used to be great! How the mighty have fallen. Nothing to do with Amazon, but let me say this is Saturday and a Christmas package was mailed to us this past Monday, with 2 other packages, from the same address. 2 packages made it and the 3rd, a box with an Xbox one and $100 Amazon card still shows it sitting 2 states away. It was scanned late Monday evening and seems to have disappeared. [Reply] Cliff Claven says: January 2, 2016 at 6:26 pm I’ve read this entire comment thread, largely siding with USPS workers. They, like our public schools and prisons, have to serve everyone, yet they are maligned and derided without thought given as to how difficult a task that is. However, I was promised an Amazon package today, for delivery to my PO Box. It’s Saturday, and the post office closes at 3PM. The package made it there, but according to the lady at the counter, after the cutoff for distribution to PO Boxes. So my goods will sit in a local post office all day Saturday and Sunday. I can go in and pick them up Monday (but not until after 10AM), 48 hours after I was promised them. My order arriving at the post office and my order arriving in my hands are two very different things to me, but apparently not to Amazon. [Reply] Tristan says: January 13, 2016 at 9:20 am Then why has my package sat for over 24hr with no progress on weekdays? [Reply] Stephen Matrese says: January 14, 2016 at 3:14 pm I am disabled and use online shopping frequently. Amazon has cancelled my (and several family member) account(s) today because I dared to report EVERY package that wasn’t delivered (I have observed a 25% on-time delivery rate with USPS and a 80% ever eventually receive it rate from Amazon).

I got a text from Amazon saying that delivery was attempted and the receptacle was blocked and the carrier left a notice. I was home and the receptacle was not blocked and there was no notice. My daughter was watching out the window for a friend at the time they claim to have attempted delivery. They never came. Now today tracking states “carrier delay has occurred.” I’m never paying for Prime again. [Reply] wow says: January 21, 2016 at 10:34 pm holy crap.. how unbelievably lazy does this article make you sound. unreal. [Reply] NoPrime NoMore says: January 31, 2016 at 3:10 am Like the author, I loved Prime because of rock solid reliable delivery. My stuff was always where I expected it when I expected it with accurate online tracking. This was especially important to me because I work 100 miles from my home, so I’m only home on the weekends. I could order stuff on Tuesday and be sure it would be on my porch by Friday night when I got home. Similarly, I could order on Thursday and have it be at my “work crash” on Monday or Tuesday. Now, with the weird combination of using USPS directly and allowing UPS and Fedex to drop work on USPS at the last second (“last mile handoff”) the reliability has gone to pot. Tracking will look good, say delivered, and the item was not there. Turns out it was delivered to the post office — 40 mile round trip from the home. The USPS does their best, but they won’t deliver to my doorstep, only to the mailbox out by the highway (1/4 mile away). Anything bigger than a breadbox ends up getting a “attempted” note. Even when delivered, it’s an extra day or two. That extra day often meant an extra work week before I got my stuff. Since this USPS change I feel that the two day shipping commitment was not just broken, it was utterly shattered. I’m sure things are better in the burbs, but in my rural area it’s a dismal development. It’s not because of bad USPS people, the local folks are doing their best. It’s just a bad idea. Prime became so unpredictable that I cancelled it and just used the money to help pay for a spot at a mailbox store near work. I now only order free shipping stuff from Amazon, have it delivered there, and I order a lot less from them. I’m ordering more from their competitors as well. I’m actually mostly OK with that, since more of my money is going to local small business instead of the Seattle yuppie. Still, I miss getting my stuff reliably delivered to my doorstep. All the other prime stuff doesn’t matter when your best connection is sub-1-mbit DSL. Prime was worth it because of the shipping, only the shipping, and always the shipping. Not any more. [Reply] Dean P says: February 11, 2016 at 12:31 am I rarely have problems with FedEx, UPS, or USPS, they are all good around here. Amazon is a different story though, I’m not a Prime member, never have been, never will be. Amazon’s order processing is my complaint, in my experience it slowed down very much from what it was a few years ago. The slowdown was gradual but increased until it seemed like Amazon was just sitting on almost every order for days, then for days and days before getting them processed and out their doors. Finally I just gave up and only use them for research and the very occasional order. eBay has become my go-to shop, I carefully peruse reviews on Amazon then go look up the item on eBay, after checking out seller ratings and such, I order. I usually get free shipping but with no minimum purchase required, and yes, I compare prices with and without shipping costs so I know if I’m getting a better deal or just equal to Amazon. I usually do better on eBay. Mind you, you absolutely HAVE TO check out seller ratings to buy from good people, I don’t like any seller with less than 99% positive, it seems like I have problems with lesser ones. Amazon can take a flying leap at a fast train for all I care. And eBay is starting to have buyer reviews too, not many yet, but it’s coming. [Reply] Daniel Lewis says: March 16, 2016 at 5:31 am The USPS situation is very aggravating. I sure do miss the days UPS would leave the package on my porch if I didn’t happen to be home or get the door in time. Now I, like many other Americans, am faced with the dreaded “Delivery Attempted” Pink Slip. The current mailman, who is supposed to deliver parcels in the morning now comes to our house with his Pink Slips pre-filled out and doesn’t even make an attempt to deliver any package over a certain size/weight determined by him! Well I got tired of it. So tired in fact that I took the morning off on the day that I knew there was a package to arrive. I filmed his deed and the conversation I had about it with him. The recording has been accepted by his boss who also gave me the number for the Postal Inspectors (PI) who he said would be able to handle it with a heavier hand. Apparently postal workers get away with a lot and their immediate supervisors’ chidings go on deaf ears. I’ve complained to the boss a few times and he’s fed up too, thus the PI involvement. You don’t have to put up with the poor service by lazy postal workers. Stand up to the USPS and you’ll be surprised to learn that they are nothing more than another service industry. Granted, it is a lot harder to make a complaint that actually effects change, but postal workers like their jobs, especially in our current economy. If you push hard enough they will come around. [Reply] William` says: March 21, 2016 at 3:35 pm It is no surprise when a notice is received or you look on line and track your item with Amazon displaying that your order was delivered. Anytime you are dealing with the “USPS” it is a big maybe with luck that your order will be delivered on time. Amazon should step up to the plate and let you know that though they promise it’s delivery time of your order on a specific date, once the USPS get’s a hold of it, it becomes only a possibility of being delivered on the date promised. Time and time again at our corporate office individuals come up to me commenting that their order is showing that it was delivered, and I have to go through the tedious process of explaining it is probably hovering somewhere at the US Postal Service Office, and hopefully you will receive it in a day or two. Hey Amazon! stop making promises you have no control over. [Reply] Maria says: April 7, 2016 at 12:10 pm I am considering cancelling my Amazon Prime service due to issues with USPS. I don’t want to pay the Amazon Prime fee just to have to drive to the post office in Kingston, NY to pick my packages up because the carrier who delivers mail to the house is too lazy to get out of her truck. USPS is so unreliable and in this case, incompetent. This carrier even misdelivers other people’s Amazon packages to my house; I can’t even imagine where some of mine have ended up. They scan a package as delivered when the package is not delivered, and Amazon has to pay to replace your shipment. I’d rather pay an extra fee to have my orders shipped by UPS rather than deal with the guessing game of what’s going to happen when I place an order. AMAZON you are NOT saving money if you have to constantly replace people’s orders due to USPS bumbling and fraud, and at some point, your Prime members will go elsewhere. [Reply] Ellen says: May 27, 2016 at 3:47 pm I am having the same frustration. Amazon Prime used to be UPS, and regardless, the USPS in our town used to actually deliver packages to your door. After an incident where a mailman got into a fender bender, the regional office made a policy not to drive up driveways where they would have to back up. They only deliver if you have a large, circular driveway. Never mind that my house is about 10 yards from the mailbox. Now, as others have mentioned, Amazon Prime delivers by USPS, which will only leave a slip, not even load the package on the truck, which results in an at minimum one day delay picking up the package. And you have to take time off work. [Reply] Rick says: June 13, 2016 at 4:51 pm I just discovered last week that I had been changed from UPS to U.S.P.S. for Amazon Prime deliveries. I live in Murphy, NC which is a pretty small town. We moved into our home in late February. I have had approximately 24 deliveries form either UPS or FedEx, ironically sometimes they pull up at the same time but don’t talk to each other! My problem is U.S.P.S. will not deliver any mail to my home. My mailbox is about 6 tenths of a mile from my home at the bottom of a small mountain. There rule is if your mailbox is more than 1/2 mile from your home they will not deliver any parcels to your door. So now, every order I place with Amazon is not even attempted for delivery, they just stick the notice of delivery attempt ( what a joke ) in your mailbox. If you don’t pick up the item the next day it will be returned to Amazon. I have spoken with 2 Amazon CSR’s and 1 Amazon CSR Supervisor. Not one of them claimed to know about this agreement with U.S.P.S. I would surely hate to stop using Amazon, I have been a Prime member since 2007. It looks like Amazon has gotten too big for it’s britches. [Reply] Trent says: June 21, 2016 at 9:16 am The problem I have with USPS is not that I ever have to go to the post office to pick something up (never have, never will–Amazon will refund me before I do). The problem is USPS sucks. And sucks hard. I frequently get mail that belongs to my next-door neighbor. I have to wonder how often my own mail never reaches my own mailbox. Packages? Often, they’re supposed to be delivered, but the USPS driver overlooks it. I know this to be the case because there have been a couple times I’ve been working outside, seen the USPS driver pass my house, then drop a package right before leaving the neighborhood. I’ve also seen “Out for delivery” status change to “Delivered” even when they haven’t delivered it. This means they forgot. So far, I’ve gotten it the next delivery day. And right now, a package that was supposed to be delivered today was misdirected by USPS, and is in the entirely wrong state. No idea when I’ll get it. I get that USPS is cheaper than UPS, but there’s a bloody good reason for that. I’d GLADLY pay extra for UPS, Amazon. [Reply] AROD says: August 6, 2016 at 7:44 pm Management is at fault with most of what goes on in the post office. All they are worried about is the carrier street time and that the carriers should be back by 5:00 PM…atleast in NYC. All they do is rush, rush, rush. They are not concerned about the service some carriers provide. [Reply] Vickie White says: September 5, 2016 at 9:37 pm Wow I am overwhelmed by all the negative responses to USPS sunday and holiday delivery for Amazon. First off I want to comment on the mailbox situation. If you don’t have the very large mailbox that many small and medium packages fit in quit your bitching. Your mail carrier is not responsible for rain, theft or your dog that they cannot tell is a threat by the bark and beware of dog signs that are posted. There is no reason on GOD’S earth you need anything other than a prescription delivered on a Sunday or a holiday. Not to mention that by ordering on line you support other countries economic growth but not America’s. So get off your lazy asses and go to a store and support your community and shop there. No worries then about where your purchases end up or when they arrive at your home. Disgruntled postal worker. [Reply] mark rouse says: September 8, 2016 at 4:12 am I will take USPS over UPS any day.

[Reply] Dan Brown says: September 15, 2016 at 9:04 pm I think people are having differing experiences is because the work ethic and morale isn’t constant across the Entire USPS. Some major mail hubs are horrible. They also have different delivery tactics in different areas. One mail carrier will concentrate on just packages, and in more rural areas they will be handled by the regular mail carrier. The USPS is also starting to hire private contractors, especially in more rural areas, not always the best trained or qualified. Also, some mail hubs are better than others. Just track a package coming from NYC through New Jersey, or anything going through Allen Park Michigan. [Reply] Ellen in NH says: September 16, 2016 at 2:49 pm My experiences with USPS is horrible when compared with other carriers who deliver very well. My daughter is in an apartment in Burlington, VT with a suite of mailboxes. There are larger boxes used for packages – when a package arrives, a note is put in the mailbox to look in the package box. Works well except on days when more packages arrive than there are boxes available. Then USPS puts a redelivery notice in the mailbox and expects my daughter to pick up at Post Office – problem is there are two PO’s serving that zip – so yesterday she had two slips for going to two different POs for packages. She fills out the slip to have it redelivered to no avail. Doesn’t happen. There is management office upstairs with locked mailroom. All other carriers drop there and the office delivers. USPS won’t because the package is in daughters name, not Mgmt company (but all other carries do it). I’ve asked for a waiver to sign to say they can be delivered to Mgmt office if boxes are full; USPS won’t do it. Instead they take the package back with them and leave the redelivery slip that starts the cycle over for 3 times and then package returns to sender. Geez – I wonder why people are using USPS less and less – could it be the lack of common sense ? Just have students sign a waiver saying the Mgmt Office is OK to leave parcels at. Heck, Fedex and other companies don’t even need that. It is, after all, a locked mail room. Also – I sent a package to my nephew at Christmas. USPS is supposed to use a security code to put package in secure gated area – if they did, he would have received. They didn’t It was DC area, he never got. But heck, I shipped it express, it was insured, so no worries, right? Wrong. They said I needed to prove they didn’t leave in gated area – they didn’t pay. Really? Is that good customer service? I wish Amazon would allow me to pick a carrier. USPS would not be it. [Reply] Bob Fricker says: September 28, 2016 at 11:18 am Misery… USPS delivers to our community mail boxes with shared parcel (larger) boxes. They put the key to Box “F” in our mail box so we can get the parcel… Key Does Not Work! Can’t seem to catch the mail carrier when she delivers and she can’t see the notes we leave in our mail box it seems. Our items are sitting that parcel box 4 or 5 days now. Neither the USPS or Amazon make it easy to remedy the problem of “Delivered” be a misrepresentation of the facts. If you deliver it to some place that I can’t get to, that is not a proper deliver. I see part of the problem as one of poor customer service. USPS is hard to get help from. Try waiting an hour or more for someone to help you on the phone, for example. Try picking your way through their web site and not being able to find any menu or information that addresses your problem, for hours. I don’t tolerate poor service for long as both entities may soon discover. [Reply] Cindy M says: October 1, 2016 at 1:07 am USPS is refusing to deliver packages to my home. They mark my boxes as Vacation Hold and I have to go to the Post Office, wait 30 minutes in line and carry the box to my car myself. Today I picked up a box that was so damaged they gave it to me inside a big black garbage bag. They refused to ship the item back to the sender. I’m currently waiting for a refund from Amazon. As for the Vacation Hold, the postal worker told my that my letter carrier does not want to carry a heavy box, so he marks it as Vac Hold. That alone is unacceptable, but one of the boxes was small enough to fit in my mail box but he still marked as Vac Hold. UPS and Fed Ex are awesome in my area, simply the best. Since Amazon is using USPS I already canceled all my Auto Shipments and will not be renewing my Prime Membership. I will not be buying anything on Amazon until they stop using USPS. If I have to wait in line and carry the box myself, I’ll just shop at the brick and mortar store, at least they have shopping carts. [Reply] sam says: October 26, 2016 at 7:16 pm Get off your but and go shopping then none of this would be a problem. [Reply] Jeff says: October 30, 2016 at 3:58 pm I stopped using Amazon except for the smallest items that I know will fit into my mailbox. I’m going to get a refund on my Prime Membership too because they are not two days any longer. I’ve spent probably around 40 to $50,000 in 4 years at Amazon. That now is being cut down around 90%. The icing on the cake was, a package has been sitting at the post office since October 6 and the 3 times I went to pick it up, the line was 10+ people with one window open. So, I just notified Amazon to take it back. $150 item. Goodbye Amazon. It was great while it lasted. [Reply] Prime says: November 2, 2016 at 10:10 am I thought it was just me. No wonder why every customer service person I spoke to on Saturday wouldn’t answer my question of “why was my package sent via USPS?” They also didn’t respond to me when they’d say, “thank you for being a Prime Member” and I’d say, “I might not be after today.” I spent 45 minutes on the phone with customer service and had to drive to 2 different post offices to get my package. The post offices were open, but didn’t answer their phones. I brought that up to Amazon and the post offices when I went there in person, and no one would talk to me about that. Glad I found this article…….bye bye Prime. [Reply] Matt says: November 12, 2016 at 11:28 am I never had an issue with FedEX, usually don’t have an issue with UPS, but always have an issue with USPS. Either the package is marked delivered and its not or most times, it gets shipped back to Amazon as Package was undeliverable. I wish Amazon would display under an item that delivery is via USPS, so that I would not order the item to start with.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Technology And Fashion: Why Innovation Is A Must For Survival Posted: Nov 14 2016, 7:17am CST | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Nov 14 2016, 7:37am CST, in News | Technology News   Photo Credit: Getty Images   Technology moves with the times whatever the industry. When it comes to mobiles, apps that allow us to socialize in a myriad of ways have come to the fore in recent years. Similarly, in the sports industry, new techniques for monitoring and increasing an athlete's VO2 max or refining their diet have led to improved performances in a variety of disciplines. Don't Miss: Hatchimals in Stock at Walmart With industry and businesses all striving to meet the demands of the modern world, it's little wonder fashion has also embraced new technology. From prototype products that turn kinetic energy from our shoes into power that can charge a phone battery to laser-etched detailing on mainstream outfits, innovations have helped advance the world of fashion. One brand that's constantly looking to evolve and embrace technology is Converse. With its 100-year anniversary looming, the sneaker manufacturer has just announced the release of its first waterproof shoe. Part of the brand's Counter Climate Shield collection, the new Converse Chuck II sneakers essentially allow wearers to stay stylish in the rain. The Billion-Dollar Brand via GIPHY Being a global brand worth almost $2 billion means that Converse has fans all around the world. Unfortunately, not every climate is as sun-kissed as the US, which is why the company is now making a waterproof version of its fashion classic. As it's done over the last century, Converse has managed to move with the times, cross boundaries and now appeal to new demographics. Back when Marquis Mills Converse launched the Converse Rubber Shoe Company, he did so in order to fill a gap in the market. His lightweight yet durable sneaker was an instant hit and it soon became the product of choice for basketball players. After Chuck Taylor endorsed the brand in 1921, Converse adorned the feet of the 1936 US Olympic basketball team. That association gave rise to the "All Star" moniker and, by the 1950s, female style icons had picked up a pair and were ready to flaunt them. Ahead of the company's centenary year, online voucher provider Couponbox has produced an infographic outlining the company's move from sporting brand to fashion icon. Innovate, Evolve and Survive New Converse shoes with waterproof canvas hits stores on Friday for $200 pic.twitter.com/xJ6NjdScGn— Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) January 12, 2016 Charting how celebrities from Shirley MacLaine to Michelle Obama have supported the brand, the infographic not only shows why fashionistas will now clamber for the latest Converse codes on Couponbox.com but how the brand has continually shifted to meet the demands of the modern user. Indeed, with today's style-setters now calling for fashion in all weathers, Converse has released a more durable version of its classic Chucks. Made from premium mesh-backed leather and a "scuba style" neoprene inner, the shoes are capable of resisting water and, additionally, providing a heat barrier for the foot. This combination of dry and warm should, in theory, make the stylish sneakers capable of stepping out in all conditions. Of course, you probably can't go around sliding through puddles and expect to stay dry, but if you're trotting from one hot spot to another in the rain, you can be sure that your designer socks will stay fluffy and fresh. The survival prospects of any fashion brand partly depend on its ability to embrace new technology. Converse offered a revolutionary basketball sneaker back in the day and through the years it hasn't lost this drive to innovate. Waterproof trainers may not be strictly necessary, but they do demonstrate a desire to evolve and that's why a company that innovates is a company that's able to survive for a century.

In addition to receiving a $100,000 stipend for participating, the 12 teams selected for Amazon sponsorship will receive Alexa-enabled devices, free Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing services, and support from the Amazon Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) team.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Donald Trump On 60 Minutes: Wants To Reunite Divided America Posted: Nov 14 2016, 5:49am CST | by Sumayah Aamir, in News | Latest Celebrity News   Getty Images Trump orders Loyalists to Stop Hurting his Opponents   Trump appeared in an interview in which he ordered loyalists to his cause to stop hurting his opponents. Donald Trump has a message for those who take his side. They ought to stop harassing minorities. In his first interview on TV, Trump spoke of how sad it made him feel when he saw Latinos and Muslims facing such blatant prejudice from his supporters. How To: Find Nintendo NES Classic In Stock Trump had the maturity and common sense to say that while he was a conservative person and a Republican that did not give his supporters any right to do what they wanted to do. Such a scenario would be a sign of anarchy and chaos.  Trump in a remorseful tone expatiated on the fact that if his acknowledgement would be of any help, he would like all such bigoted expressions of hatred and discrimination to end. He said in his first interview to CBS' 60 Minutes that his supporters should just stop doing the things they were doing since they were not helping his cause by their actions. “The Donald” as his admirers know him, said that if his saying so will be of any help, he will just say “Stop It!”… In fact, Trump had the courage of his convictions and turned to the camera focused on him and said in a loud and emphatic way “Stop It!” which clearly sent out an imperative message to his supporters. Many of Trump’s vote bank members have gone on to scrawl racist messages on school walls and been a nuisance. This has worked in favor of his opponents who still continue thronging the streets saying that he is not fit to be President. The 2016 election has had the most polarizing effect so far in all of American history. It has left the Democrats fuming and many minorities scared for their lives in an America ruled by the likes of Donald Trump. However, Trump has also spoken out regarding the prejudice that the media was highlighting to its advantage. Trump said that there were just a few incidents of racism and bigotry and they had been blown way out of proportion by the media machine. He pointed out that most of the incidents were characteristic of large white schools and were not symbolic of what went on in the rest of a democratic and free America. Trump still did say that he wanted to take everyone along with him in a truly united America. So he was going to send the message loud and clear to his supporters to simmer down. Now that he was in the position of President Elect, his earlier blustering ways had softened and been subdued and toned down a little. Trump explained away the anti-Trump protestors as just a load of hype created by the free press. He said that it was a horrible thing to witness. The man who would soon be POTUS added that the press likes to make a mountain out of a molehill. They will take the smallest of incidents and blow it up till it is way out of proportion. Donald Trump went on to address certain issues in the United States that had to be fixed. One of them was the FBI and its administration. He said that he was still thinking of whether he should ask the FBI director to hand in his resignation or not. The FBI director, James Comey’s decision to end the inquiry into Hillary’s emails was something the Republicans took notice of. Trump said that he was still wavering over this issue. While he did respect the institution that was the FBI, there had been leakages and he would have to ultimately talk in person with James Comey.  Trump admitted that the FBI director may have had very logical reasons to do what he did but it was still wrong as far as principles go. Comey still has half a dozen years more in office. If he resigns it would be on a very premature basis. Trump furthermore spoke of how he was looking into the ethical conundrums that were perpetrated by Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of State. She definitely made some very hasty decisions and he would have to weigh the pros and cons of dealing with her. Trump said that same-sex marriages were something he wouldn’t oppose during his time in office. He said that since it was already a settled fact, he wouldn’t interfere in the matter at all. However, Trump was dead against abortions. He said that he would do everything he can to uphold the law in this case. Trump spoke of how everybody was a lobbyist in Washington. He said that he would clean up the whole place given the first chance. The system of government had gone foul. It needed rectification and correction. Trump said that he would do a better job of handling the grave threat of ISIS with his hand-picked generals. Despite having little experience in this field of war games, he said that he could handle it with one hand tied behind his back. The real surprise came when Trump said that he was not going to take any the money that went as a perk to being the POTUS. He would only take the nominal salary of $1 per year. His own business raked in billions. What need did he have for more money!

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Dave Chappelle Addresses Trump Election And Racial Issues On SNL Posted: Nov 14 2016, 7:28am CST | by Sumayah Aamir, Updated: Nov 14 2016, 10:26pm CST, in News | Latest Celebrity News     Dave Chappelle gets candid about being black and the state of America following Trump’s election demanding to be given a chance. It was the first Saturday Night Live show following the Presidential Election 2016 and the show did not shy away from the political agenda. How To: Find Pokemon Go Plus In Stock In its show prior to the election, many people complained that the show had given a cold ending to the whole Trump-Clinton scenario.  The elections turned out to yield unexpected results for the general population America as Donald Trump became the President-Elect. To address the issue on the show, an SNL veteran was invited back. Dave Chappelle was welcomed for his monologue with enthusiastic applause which he acknowledged and accepted. Representing two of the demonized minorities by Trump, black and Muslim; Chappelle made his monologue snappy, witty and touching all the issues that the general population has on its mind currently. He started by saying that he didn’t know that Donald Trump was going to win the election, he suspected it though. He said that he knew Hilary was doing well at the polls but then again he knew white people and they are not as surprising as they once used to be. He said that he could not believe that America had actually elected an internet troll as the President. He then talked about the riots across America. He said that he had saw a ‘white riot’ in Portland, Oregon. Being a black person, he said that the black people had already experienced all of that and they were not moved by it. He said he was staying out of it and let the white population figure it out amongst themselves. The reason he said that he or most black people were not affected was because they had been here before. They had more pressing issues to be concerned about. The shootings and the mass shootings in the past whole year which included the Pulse nightclub shooting which shook the whole country. He also mentioned the Harambe shooting incident and how a gorilla was more of a difficult decision for Cincinnati PD than shooting black people. He talked about Black Lives Matter movement and said it wasn’t the best tagline but they could not help being black and see how they were treated. He reiterated an incident about staying at one of Trump’s hotel and following the behavior that Trump had suggested in his Access Hollywood tape to the hotel maid. He said that all the rich black people were talking about moving out of the country. He said he was going to stay to see how the tax break worked out. He said that when he had started to earn good money, the most unexpected thing happened and Obama became President. Chappelle said that he didn’t think that a black president would even be a possibility. He mentioned Trump’s visit to Obama and also made some witty quips about the meeting. He also asked the audience if they would miss Obama as President. He said that not only was he a black President but he had also made it out alive from the situation. He then turned a bit of a serious tone and told the crowd that he had been to the White House for a party. He had been walking the halls and they went to the West wing in a hall where there were portraits of all the former Presidents. He said that standing there, he remembered all the times when black people could not even enter the White House without causing controversy. And Obama’s presidency had allowed so many black people to be guests at the house. It was change which made him happy and hopeful for the future of the country. He said that in that spirit he was giving Trump Presidency a chance. He said that the black people demand that Donald Trump would give their “historically disenfranchised” people that he give them a chance too. In his almost twelve minutes long monologue, Chappelle made more sense of the country’s current state than the whole media in the last week of election frenzy with a peaceful resolution for the future.

Login Register Public Release: 14-Nov-2016 Retail clinics do not reduce ER visits for minor ailments Study provides further evidence retail clinics may not cut health costs RAND Corporation Share  Print  E-Mail The opening of retail medical clinics near hospital emergency departments does not reduce visits to the emergency departments for minor health ailments, according to a new RAND Corporation study. There has been hope that retail clinics will help lower health care costs by diverting care from costly emergency departments to more convenient and lower-cost retail clinics, but the new findings do not support that idea. The study examined the experiences of more than 2,000 emergency departments across 23 states over a five-year period and found the opening of retail medical clinics was not associated with any significant reduction in visits to emergency departments for 11 low-acuity ailments such as respiratory infections and ear aches. The findings are published online by Annals of Emergency Medicine. "One hope for retail clinics was that they might divert patients from making expensive visits to the emergency department for minor conditions such as bronchitis or urinary tract infections," said Grant Martsolf, lead author of the study and a policy researcher at RAND, a nonprofit research organization. "But we found no evidence that this has been happening. "Instead of lowering costs, retail clinics may be substituting for care in other settings such as primary care practices or spur some patients to seek care for problems they previously would have treated on their own." Retail clinics are walk-up medical providers typically located in drug stores such as CVS and in retail chain stores such as Target and Wal-Mart. Most often care is provided by nurse practitioners rather than by physicians. First appearing in 2000, there are now nearly 2,000 retail clinics across the United States and they receive more than 6 million patient visits annually. Visits to retail clinics are less expensive than visits to physician offices or emergency departments, both because fees are lower and fewer tests are performed. Researchers used information from the federal Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Emergency Department Databases from 2006 to 2012 to combine emergency department use with information about the opening of retail clinics obtained from Merchant Medicine, a research firm that tracks trends in walk-in medicine. Retail clinical penetration was measured as the percentage of an emergency department's catchment area that overlapped with a 10-minute drive of a retail clinic. The 11 low-acuity conditions studied are commonly seen in both retail clinics and hospital emergency departments. Researchers generally found no connection between the opening of retail clinics and visits to emergency departments for the low-acuity conditions, even when retail clinics began opening up near emergency departments. The exception was among people with private insurance, where an extremely small drop in use of emergency department visits was detected. Even when patient access to retail clinics increased substantially in the area served by an emergency department, the reduction in emergency department visits for these conditions among the privately insured was less than 1 percent. "Retail clinics may emerge as an important location for medical care to meet increasing demand as more people become insured under the Affordable Care Act," said co-author Dr. Ateev Mehrotra, an associate professor at the Harvard Medical School and an adjunct researcher at the RAND Corporation. "But contrary to our expectations, we found retail clinics do not appear to be leading to meaningful reductions in low-urgency visits to hospital emergency departments." ### Support for the study was provided by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Other authors of the study are Kathryn R. Fingar and Rosanna Coffey of Truven Health Analytics, Ryan Kandrack and Christine Eibner of RAND, Tom Charland of Merchant Medicine, and Anne Elixhauser and Claudia Steiner of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. RAND Health is the nation's largest independent health policy research program, with a broad research portfolio that focuses on health care costs, quality and public health preparedness, among other topics.

But it won't be the first of its kind for the Valley. The membership-only warehouse club's business model is similar to that of BJ's Wholesale Club and Sam's Club. BJ's has been in business for decades at 1785 Airport Road in Allentown. Sam's Club, which is owned by Wal-Mart, opened a warehouse virtually across the street from BJ's in the Shoppes at Airport Center several years ago and has another warehouse at Northampton Crossings in Lower Nazareth Township. But for many in the Valley, Costco represents something entirely different. With more than 500 locations in the U.S., it is the biggest warehouse club chain in the nation. Here's what's in store for the new store: When is it opening? Shoppers can get in starting at 8 a.m. Friday, Nov. 18. Where is it located? The Hamilton Crossings shopping center is off the Route 222 Bypass at its intersection with Krocks Road in Lower Macungie Township. How big is the warehouse? It's 148,000 square feet. How much does it cost to become a member? A Gold Star membership, which is valid at all Costcos worldwide, costs $55 a year. An Executive membership sells for $110 a year and includes added benefits such as greater discounts. How do I become a member? Anyone can sign up on Costco's website. What can I buy at the warehouse? Pretty much anything. As a wholesale club, it specializes in bulk items – 10-pound tubs of strawberry preserves, 72-count boxes of frozen waffles and the biggest bags of potato chips you're likely to ever see. Costco carries both name brands and its own label, Kirkland Signature. Clothes, jewelry, furniture, electronics, travel packages, insurance, pharmaceuticals and toiletries are also among Costco's offerings. The state of 9 once-thriving local malls What's the deal with the free samples? "There's no brand that's as strongly associated with free samples as Costco," The Atlantic reported in a story looking at the psychology behind giving out free food samples. Members can peruse the aisles and fill up on sweet and savory bites of all kinds of food items being offered at sample tables. Those who want to indulge are advised to shop on an empty stomach. Will I actually save money? Business Insider last month did a comparison of Costco prices to Amazon Prime prices. "It turns out that Costco is the cheapest by a landslide, with an average discount of 19 percent on items where there was a price discrepancy," the website reported.  Nick Falsone may be reached at nfalsone@lehighvalleylive.com.

Skip to content Military Technologies Military Press Releases Pulse Provides Q3 Report and Outlook DENVER, Nov. 14, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — The Pulse Beverage Corporation (“Pulse”) (OTCQX:PLSB), makers of Natural Cabana® Lemonades/Limeades and Coconut Waters, and PULSE® Heart & Body Health functional beverages, today provided its Q3 Report and Outlook. Business Highlights for Q3-2016 to Date: During Q3-2016 Pulse continued its strategic decision to move from a direct store delivery distribution system (“DSD”) to a hybrid system of 75 of its strongest Class “A” DSDs and 20 wholesalers, concentrating placements into high volume cold box sets. During this time Pulse eliminated a number of weaker, non-performing DSDs in certain geographical areas in order to move its distribution to a warehouse direct to wholesaler system. This decision was made to reduce overhead associated with the effort to manage a direct store delivery distribution system. Pulse rationalized the number and placement of salespeople in the field. The overall effect was a reduction of $437,000 in overhead during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2015. Fixed overhead has been reduced to below $80,000 per month going into Q4-2016. The decrease in net sales and gross profit during Q3-2016 was planned in order to grow sales from a more profitable fixed overhead base. During Q3-2016 Pulse reduced freight-out and costly promotional programs which increased gross profit and contribution margins. During Q3-2016 we provided an additional $107,495 to fully allow for a doubtful account in Mexico. We expect to partially recover this account receivable in the future. We also wrote-off a $40,000 financing fee during Q3-2016. During Q3 Pulse introduced its newest private label product, “Citrus Tree®”, which is Natural Cabana® Lemonade/Limeade formula in a 16.9oz glass bottle in four flavors: Natural, Strawberry, Tropical Mango and Cherry Limeade. This new product is a private label brand sold through Acme Markets, a division of Albertsons, a 176 store supermarket chain in New York and Philadelphia metro areas having a population of more than 40 million. Pulse has sold more than 5,000 cases to date since its introduction. Robert E. Yates, CEO of Pulse, said, “We are in the midst of a major thrust in the American Northeast and are thrilled to bring on Citrus Tree® to help broaden our reach into the American Northeast, a highly populated and influential region.” In September, 2016 Pulse announced that 57 Tom Thumb supermarkets, a Division of Safeway Dallas/Ft Worth and 44 Randalls supermarkets, a Division of Safeway Houston, as well as 90 Albertsons supermarkets in the Dallas/Ft Worth metroplex area are all carrying Natural Cabana Lemonade/Limeade and Coconut Water in 182 upscale supermarket stores. Additionally, Pulse secured listings for its 20oz Natural Cabana® Lemonade/Limeade in 64 PriceRite supermarkets found in Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Virginia. Parley Sheya, VP and National Sales Manager of Pulse, said, “These high end supermarket stores are an exciting addition for us as they are busy upscale competitive stores. Revenue associated with these listings will start to be fully realized starting in Q4-2016 and fully realized during 2017.” During October, 2016 Pulse secured placement of Natural Cabana® Lemonade/Limeade in 340 Walmart Supercenters and Neighborhood Markets in the States of Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Colorado, Utah, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico and West Texas. The sets will be completed by the end of October. As part of the Walmart rollout Pulse adds KeHE Distributors LLC to assist in the distribution of its products into Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Northern California. The KeHe network includes 17 North American warehouses and 470 trucks with daily routes serving nearly half of the top 100 retailers from coast to coast. Additionally, Pulse secured listings to sell Natural Cabana® Coconut Water through 29 Dierbergs Markets, one of the dominant grocery store retailers in the St. Louis area and through Stater Bros Markets, a 169 store supermarket chain in Southern California. Pulse will be placed in the high traffic cold box produce section of Stater Bros Markets. Bob Yates, CEO of Pulse, said, “When we team up with major retailers like Walmart, consumers easily find our prominently displayed products thereby increasing revenue and earnings for our shareholders; we estimate annual sales from this new listing of over $1,000,000.” Mr. Yates went on to add, “KeHE will help us with other major retailers we were not able to get to with our existing distribution network. Our effort over the last few months in moving to a hybrid distribution system has allowed us to reduce our overhead costs which will move us towards profitability sooner. The full effect of our overhead reductions will be fully realized in 2017. We continue to be pleased with the overwhelming success of our new coconut water. We are confident in the marketing strategies and the delivery/execution of our new strategic growth plan into 2017 and we look forward to communicating with our shareholders as these growth plans unfold during the remainder of 2016.” About The Pulse Beverage Corporation The Pulse Beverage Corporation is an emerging beverage company that offers beverage brands that are great tasting, good-for-you, refreshing, low-calorie natural drinks.

Employers regionally and nationally still need people trained to fix cars, provide health care, assemble pipes and build machines, filling "middle-skill" jobs that typically require a few years or less of training after high school and often provide comfortable salaries despite any reputation otherwise, said Ted Abernathy, managing partner of the consulting firm Economic Leadership in North Carolina. "You cannot be a competitive place in America without skilled labor," he told about 200 public school teachers and others at the Springdale Chamber of Commerce's second Workforce Summit. When it comes to middle-skilled workers, the most ambitious regions "train them, they grow them, they attract them, they retrain them -- and those places have the competitive advantage." Schools and businesses across Benton and Washington counties are trying to make Northwest Arkansas such a place, partnering to catch students, like Springdale High School senior Maribelle Escutia, who want to become a physician's assistant or a welder and don't want or need to go to a four-year college to get there. "I want to just get started," without the time or debt often needed for a bachelor's degree, said Escutia, who hopes to go into nursing. She joined hundreds of other students at the event's second day, which included about 40 area employers looking for potential hires and a tour of Northwest Technical Institute in Springdale. Pea Ridge Public School District offers a Manufacturing and Business Academy charter school and partners with companies including Wal-Mart and Bentonville Plastics, for example. Bentonville schools offer part-time apprenticeships with area businesses for school credit. Springdale and other districts together have more than 300 students enrolled in certificate programs at the technical institute. Thousands of people of all ages go to the institute and Northwest Arkansas Community College for postsecondary or associate's degree programs as well. "If you listen to our businesses and you listen to their biggest concerns, their concern is that they have unfilled jobs that they say require middle-skilled employees. They say it all the time," said economist Kathy Deck, director of the University of Arkansas' Center for Business and Economic Research. "There have to be paths other than traditional higher education, college degrees, that lead to economic success." The Springdale chamber held the event to foster more of those partnerships that aim at the roughly one in four high school graduates who won't go to college but have the temperament for more training, said Perry Webb, chamber president and chief executive officer. "We all operate in our own little vacuum," he said in an interview. "We're trying to bring all the players into a room." If a training program can help a young worker get $2 more per hour at the start of his career, the boost could accumulate to hundreds of thousands of dollars more in a lifetime, Perry added. About half of the country's jobs fall into the middle-skill category, according to the National Skills Coalition, a research and advocacy group in Washington. Almost 60 percent of Arkansas' 1 million jobs fall in the category, as well, based on data from the coalition and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The coalition also reports the state's workers fill about 80 percent of those middle-skilled jobs, leaving tens of thousands of positions open. The shortage has been a common story around the country as occupations have become more technology-based and the economy has globalized over the past several decades, Harvard Business School researchers wrote in a 2014 report on middle-skilled labor. Employers focused on training their own employees instead of establishing communitywide chains of schools and companies to find and train an entire workforce, they said, while the country saw a bachelor's degree as more and more essential. "A majority of Americans do not think everyone should go to college, but the vast majority of parents think their sons and daughters should go, and the students themselves feel the same way," Georgetown University researchers wrote in a 2012 report on career and technical education. College degrees generally lead to higher income, according to U.S. Census data from 2015. In the four-county Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers metropolitan statistical area, adults age 25 or older with only a high school diploma typically made about $29,000 a year at the median, and 12 percent of them were in poverty. Those with a bachelor's degree made $49,000 with 3 percent in poverty, and the trend continued with more advanced degrees. On the other hand, less than half the students who go to public colleges in Arkansas graduate within six years, according to the state's Department of Higher Education. UA does better, graduating almost two-thirds of its students within six years. Nationally, some drop out with tens of thousands of dollars in debt and little to show for it, Webb said. Meanwhile, the nation's workforce is full of people alternately underqualified or overqualified for the jobs available or qualified for something else entirely, the Harvard researchers wrote. "There's people without degrees that don't have jobs yet," said Saul Martinez, another Springdale High senior at the event who's interested in health care or construction jobs, the kind that give on-the-job education instead of requiring years of study before work. A university spokesman said officials weren't available to comment Friday. Several middle-skill occupations earn near or around the state's average pay of $38,000, according to the labor bureau. Nurses in the state make about $57,000 on average. Automotive workers and computer repairers fell mostly into the mid-$30,000s on average, while electricians made about $42,000. And many of the jobs give plenty of opportunities for advancement and pay raises, event participants said. The participants gave a message on higher education more nuanced than the expectation of sending everyone to college: A bachelor's degree can be worth it for those who want to and can get it, but those who don't fit in that group have options -- just don't stop at a high school diploma. People at every educational level share the need to continually update and add to their skills, Abernathy said. "Our kids can't be happy just finishing high school," said John Riggs IV, chairman of Arkansas' J.A. Riggs Tractor Co. "They need something else." Riggs is a former state senator and a former Little Rock School Board member. To fill the middle-skill gap, Harvard and Georgetown researchers and other experts shared the view of Webb, the Springdale chamber president, that businesses and public institutions must build connections with one other. They can then share what kinds of jobs are coming and how best to prepare people for them. "America's system of middle-skills development needs a kick-start, and the conditions could not be better," the Harvard researchers wrote in their 2014 report. In that vein, Prairie Grove Public Schools recently applied for a charter school with nursing and construction technology courses, said business teacher Mandy Bartholomew. Northwest Technical Institute is working on expanding its Gravette branch into a full manufacturing program for high school students and adults and on making locations in Benton and Washington counties into centers offering multiple programs so students don't have to travel to Springdale. The Fayetteville Chamber of Commerce has put together a fabrication lab downtown to allow residents to use 3-D printers and other machinery. Down the road, Multi-Craft Contractors is helping open a robotics lab in downtown Fayetteville that should start taking students early next year, said Tomas Blodgett, the operations director for the company's robotics division, who started there as a machinist. "The response has been nothing short of phenomenal in my 21 years of doing this," said Mike Harvey, interim president of the Northwest Arkansas Council, a nonprofit that aims to build connections between private and public groups to strengthen the area's economy. The next challenge will be to make sure students can easily move from one educational path to another if they choose, he added, but in general, "it's coming together." Companies also offer some of their own training. Nabholz Construction, for example, takes on laborers with no training for a starting salary of up to $27,000 and offers four-year apprenticeships to become a carpenter, welder or other skilled craftsman, at which point the salary jumps to at least $40,000 and can keep going up, Jill Booker, a project manager in the company's concrete division, told dozens of students at the event. "We're always looking for somebody," she said, adding she was specifically on the lookout for people with teamwork and other "soft" skills. "We can teach them the rest." Bartholomew said she was glad to get in touch with other schools and see how they build their programs, but another important piece of the event was hearing people like Booker say they have jobs waiting. "Students are almost embarrassed they're going to NTI or some technical school," she said. "This just emphasizes that we need that."

Yep, everyone can drop out of high school now, because factories will be opening back up all across the land, paying easily $38,000 a year for unskilled labor, or at least that is what most white Arkansans believe, because they voted for Trump, and he never lies, right?

A few shops hold out against the pressure to discount Credit: epa Tom Ough 14 November 2016 • 3:35pm Since Black Friday descended on the UK in 2013, it has come to entirely occupy the high street. Well, not entirely: one small band of indomitable retailers still holds out against the invading day of discounts. Not every chain has disclosed its Black Friday policy yet, but here are those who have openly opted out. Remember, these stores are well aware millions of people will be looking for bargains online and on the high street over the Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend (November 25 - 28), so you may well spot some great deals at these shops. They just won't be advertised as Black Friday offers.  Black Friday retailer grid Asda How the tables turn. Asda, the cousin of US shopping giant Wal-Mart, was Black Friday’s pioneer in this country. But a series of unseemly stampedes for flat-screen TVs made it clear that Black Friday and supermarkets don’t mix well. They are unlikely to participate this year, having pulled out of the 2015 event with the following euphemistic explanation: Instead of the hustle and bustle and pressure of one or two day sales where customers typically push the boat out on high-value items, this year Asda customers say they’d prefer deals on value-for-money, high-quality products that all the family can enjoy.   The chaos and carnage of Black Friday - by numbers Play! 01:15 Next Like Primark, value clothes retailer Next maintains low profit margins throughout the year, and thus has less to gain than rivals from discounting further.  “Next has a policy of not discounting between its standard sale periods that fall at the same time each year”, the group explained. Black Friday product grid Ikea It’s a similar story with Ikea, who sell comparatively cheap furniture throughout the year. Not only that, but furniture tends to last longer than Black Friday staples like clothing and technology Emily Birkin, who is in charge of Ikea sales in the UK and Ireland, says: “Low price is the cornerstone of the IKEA vision and we will always remain focused on providing a range of home furnishing products that are affordable to as many people as possible. “Each year we look at how we can invest in reducing our prices even further, from design and production to more efficient packaging and transport. Our ambition is to offer everyday low prices all year round, which is why we don't take part in temporary discounting events.” FAQ | Black Friday Follow The Telegraph READ MORE ABOUT: Ikea Asda Primark Cyber Monday Show more Black Friday and Cyber Monday latest 16 Nov 2016, 6:00am Half of electrical goods sold on Black Friday are cheaper at other times of year, investigation finds  16 Nov 2016, 12:01am Best Amazon Black Friday deals on Wednesday 16th November - £250 off Sony TVs and a third off beauty products 15 Nov 2016, 4:15pm Black Friday: how to spot the best travel deals 15 Nov 2016, 4:00pm Predictions on the best Black Friday travel deals 01:15 15 Nov 2016, 3:01pm What date is Black Friday 2016?

Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 71.42 +0.93 +1.32% Intuit Inc INTU ▲ 110.90 +0.89 +0.81% AAP Inc AAPJ = 0.0037 0.0000 0.00% Cisco Systems Inc CSCO ▲ 31.70 +0.33 +1.05% Donald Trump's surprise victory in a tight presidential election defied Wall Street expectations, not only regarding who would lead the country, but the market's reaction to that leader. Instead of latching onto the uncertainties, the market vaulted higher on the president-elect's promise of changing the tax code and launching a huge spending program to stimulate the economy. Interest rates rose and market talk turned to inflation and higher growth. Trump's transition will be a big focus for markets in the week ahead, and of particular interest will be any guidance on whom he plans to name for key Cabinet jobs. Some of those names could be market moving, given the emphasis during the campaign on things like trade and deregulation. There is also a busy economic calendar, with the highlights both Tuesday's retail sales report and CPI inflation data Thursday. © Provided by CNBC The retail sales data and also the comments from merchants, who report earnings during the week, could provide important insights into how consumers weathered the election season. Retailers reporting earnings include Home Depot (HD) on Tuesday, Target (TGT) on Wednesday and Wal-Mart (WMT) on Thursday. Stocks in the past week surged, with the Dow (.DJI) rallying 5 percent to a new high, its best gain in five years. The Dow ended Friday at 18.847, and the S&P 500 (.SPX) was up 3.8 percent at 2,164. The Nasdaq was up 3.7 percent, but the small-cap Russell 2000 outperformed with a more than 10 percent gain. At the same time, U.S. Treasury yields zipped higher, particularly at the long end. The10-year Treasury (US10Y) yield jumped to 2.15 percent, the highest level since January, from a pre-election level of 1.8 percent. Literally overnight Tuesday into Wednesday, market sentiment shifted, and so did the stocks that were in favor. Financials ripped higher, up 11.3 percent for the week on the outlook for higher rates and less regulation. That was the best week for the sector since the bull market began in 2009. Industrials bounced nearly 8 percent, and the Industrial Select SPDR Fund (XLI) ETF had its best week in five years. Health care jumped 6 percent on Trump's vow to eliminate parts of Obamacare and on relief that Hillary Clinton did not win. She was outspoken on drug pricing and viewed as negative for drugs and biotech. The IBB (IBB) iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF jumped 14.4 percent in its best week ever. There was selling in some tech names like Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX), as investors shifted into new market leadership. "What you've also done here is you've priced in growth based on a resumption of animal spirits that may or may not occur. The point is what we do know this is a [president] who is likely to regulate less, not more. This is also an environment where interest rates have risen sharply enough that we could probably say with pretty high conviction that the lows in interest rates that you saw in July were very significant lows, the psychology around interest rates is turning," said Julian Emanuel, equity and derivatives strategy at UBS. Emanuel is keeping his year-end target for the S&P 500 just slightly higher than Friday's close at 2,175. With the markets now pricing in higher interest rates, Fed officials take to the speaking circuit in the coming week and they are being watched to see if they endorse the idea of a December rate hike, as several have already. Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer speaks Tuesday, New York Fed President William Dudley speaks Friday and there are more than a half dozen others appearing throughout the week. "If the Fed doesn't raise rates in December, they're never going to raise them," said Jeff Gundlach, CEO of DoubleLine, in an appearance on CNBC. Gundlach also said he believes the run up in yields is about 80 percent over, but the move higher should also resume next year. Strategists say the time is right for the Fed to move, given the positive reaction in markets to the changes coming in Washington. "What's important for active managers, important in that their decisions have been governed and their difficulty in generating alpha in the last four or five years, has been very much a function of the psychological slog of ultra-accommodative monetary policy being the single most determinant of asset prices," said Emanuel. "The thought of that ending is really the thing that, for us, has caused a lot of sector rotation. There's been a ton of turn in the market. it's also changed the psychology. … The people we talk to are more engaged in trying to come up with alpha generating ideas more than in the entire period of the post financial crisis." As U.S. yields rose, emerging markets were also stung by a sharp jump in rates. Their currencies were slammed, especially the Mexican peso (MXN=), which was down more than 10 percent on the week. Investors will be watching out for any comments from Trump on many topics, including trade. In an interview Friday with The Wall Street Journal, he said he would potentially impose tariffs on products of companies that relocate overseas. Oil slumped in the past week, sliding 15 percent amid supply concerns. West Texas Intermediate futures were trading just above $43 late Friday. The S&P energy sector, however was up 2 percent even with the breakdown in crude futures. "If it breaks $43, it will be a huge worry," said Art Cashin, director of floor operations at UBS. He said stocks could move higher but there will be bumps along the way, particularly if oil remains under pressure.

Teslas in the Trailer Parks: California's Housing Squeeze The New York Times 2 days ago By CONOR DOUGHERTY < PREVIOUS SLIDESLIDE 1 of 8NEXT SLIDE > The tech industry has provided tens of thousands of jobs, but the housing stock in Sunnyvale, Menlo park and Mountain View has not caught up. © Damien Maloney/The New York Times MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — If there is anything that just about every Californian agrees with, it is that it costs too much to live in the state. Over the last few years, the price of buying a home or renting an apartment has become so burdensome that it pervades almost every issue, from the state’s elevated poverty rate to the debate about multimillion-dollar tear-downs to the lines of recreational vehicles parked on Silicon Valley side streets. Quotes in the article Yahoo! Inc YHOO ▲ 40.21 +0.91 +2.32% The town of Mountain View, Google’s home, wants to do something about that. Given new marching orders from a reform-minded City Council that was swept into office here two years ago, Mountain View is looking to increase its housing stock by as much as 50 percent — including as many as 10,000 units in the area around Google’s main campus. “We need to provide housing because there’s a housing shortage,” said Lenny Siegel, a Mountain View councilman. That may seem an obvious tautology, but it turns out to be highly contentious in a state where most cities and suburbs are still dominated by anti-growth politics that seek to maximize the construction of tax-generating offices while minimizing the number of budget-depleting residents. Sign up for the Morning Briefing newsletter Mountain View’s political evolution, combined with some limited cases elsewhere, suggests that as rent and home prices have reached the point where even highly paid tech workers are struggling — the median home here costs $1.4 million, according to Zillow — the tide is slowly shifting away from resisting growth at all costs and instead trying to channel it. This Silicon Valley city of about 80,000 people is also a reminder that, despite the outsize attention given to big cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles, any solution to California’s housing crisis is going to rely heavily on suburbs as well. This was underscored by the results of last week’s election, when voters across California passed various affordable housing measures along with new transit funding, and, in some cases, rejected efforts to restrict or cap development. In Palo Alto, several pro-housing candidates were elected to the City Council. Residents in Mountain View approved rent control. “Housing used to be about ‘them’ — like poverty or unemployment,” said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy. “But it has become so expensive in the Bay Area that housing now touches enough people to win elections.” For all its imagination about the future, Silicon Valley’s geography looks a lot like the past. Today’s college-educated millennials might be crowding into city centers, but each day employees at companies like Google and Facebook endure hours in cars or on buses commuting to squat office complexes that have all the charm of a Walmart. Many employees say they would prefer to live closer to work. But these companies reside in small cities that consider themselves suburbs, and the local politics are usually aligned against building dense urban apartments to house them. Take Palo Alto, the Silicon Valley city that has become emblematic of the state’s reputation for rampant not-in-my-backyard politics. Palo Alto has one of the state’s worst housing shortages. With about three jobs for every housing unit, it has among the most out-of-balance mixes anywhere in Silicon Valley. But instead of dealing with this issue by building the few thousand or so apartments it would take to make a dent in the problem, the city has mostly looked to restraining a pace of job growth that the mayor described as “unhealthy.” Farther up the peninsula near San Francisco, the small city of Brisbane told a developer that its proposal for a mixed-use development with offices and 4,000 housing units should have offices for about 15,000 workers, but no new housing. Play that out a thousand times over and the crux of the state’s housing crisis is clear: Everyone knows housing costs are unsustainable and unfair, and that they pose a threat to the state’s economy. Yet every city seems to be counting on its neighbors to step up and fix it. The results are strange compromises like the one made by Rebecca and Steven Callister, a couple in their late 20s who live in a double-wide trailer in a Mountain View mobile home park whose residents are retirees and young tech workers. Mr. Callister is an engineer at LinkedIn, the sort of worker who, in most places, would own a home. But given the cost of housing in Mountain View and the brutal commute times from anywhere they could afford, a trailer makes the most sense and lets him spend more time with the couple’s two young children. “We joke that it’s the only mobile home park with Mercedeses and Teslas in the driveway,” Mrs. Callister said. “It’s like the new middle class in California.” In contrast to Palo Alto, Mountain View is trying to wedge new apartments into its office parks. Much of the action centers on the North Bayshore area, a neighborhood of low-slung office buildings surrounded by asphalt parking lots. Each weekday morning, North Bayshore fills up with cars and young Google employees. They pack the narrow sidewalks and zip around on multicolored bikes. But then the day ends, everyone goes home and there is not much left besides sounds from the nearby freeway and overachievers working late. Mr. Siegel, the city councilman, wants to turn this prototypical example of sprawl into a bustling urban neighborhood. The city has plans for nearly 10,000 new apartments and hopes that businesses like a grocery store, bars and retail shops will follow them. Here in Mountain View, as in many places, residents are mostly aligned against putting too many apartments near the city’s core single-family-home neighborhoods. The city is looking to create new neighborhoods by pushing growth to areas like North Bayshore, where there are already a lot of jobs and few neighbors to complain. Versions of that strategy are taking hold across the Bay Area. Sunnyvale, where Yahoo is based, is looking to transform an older industrial area near one of its rail stations into a new development that would include offices and housing. Menlo Park is studying how to allow for up to 4,500 housing units to be built on industrial land near Facebook’s headquarters. Chris Meany, a partner at Wilson Meany, a real estate development firm in San Francisco, recently headed up a project in San Mateo, about a half-hour south of San Francisco. There, a defunct horse-racing track is being redeveloped into a mixed-use project that sits along a train stop and will eventually comprise five office buildings and 1,000 houses, apartments and condos. Given the political resistance to new housing and the cascade of lawsuits that are a good bet to follow any new proposal, Mr. Meany said he and other developers were more likely to focus on mega-projects with a bigger payoff. “A planner would go out and say, ‘We should do things regionally and scatter housing throughout the area,’” he said. “But if you’re the developer who has to actually get it done, it is better to go off and find large areas of problematic land than trying to choose the smartest location.” North Bayshore was historically farmland and the site of the city dump, but in the 1970s, when tech first started booming, Mountain View looked to develop it into a low-density office park. The area has since become a symbol of Silicon Valley’s booms and busts. Early tenants included faded giants like Silicon Graphics. Then came the 1990s and the dot-com boom and bust. In 1999, just before the bust hit, a little start-up named Google moved from Palo Alto to North Bayshore when it had only a few dozen employees. Today, Google has about 20,000 workers here, and the crush of daily commuters leads to long backups at the three freeway exits into the area. Four years ago — as Google was swelling, rents were exploding and eviction stories were becoming commonplace — Mountain View started looking to redevelop North Bayshore. The acrimonious debate over whether to add housing included both predictions that the neighborhood would fill up with the tech equivalent of Chinese factory dorms and worries that residents would disturb a habitat for local burrowing owls. One city councilman even suggested that if the city built housing in North Bayshore, it could create a Google voting bloc that would turn Mountain View into a factory town. But after the City Council decided against adding new housing, voters responded by electing three pro-housing candidates, including Mr. Siegel. One of the new Council’s first acts was to instruct the city’s planning department to study ways to add housing to North Bayshore. That decision was unanimous. Since then the Council has approved about 2,000 new units elsewhere in town. In all, Mountain View is studying how to add a total of 17,000 units. Mr. Siegel said developers submitted more proposals for housing than the city could process, so the town was looking to hire more planners. There are plenty of desks and a budget to pay them, but few want to take the job. “They can’t afford to live here,” Mr. Siegel said.

Although it doesn't seem like winter is upon us, it is time for the annual Salvation Army Red Kettle bell ringing campaign. The campaign begins during the month of November and concludes on Dec. 24. Once again, the local Salvation Army unit is in need of volunteer ringers. Over the past three years, nearly $80,000 was raised each year to help support community needs. There is now a local office at 840 N. Lincoln Ave., Suite 101, that provides direct services by Olga Duvall, service center coordinator. Last year, our volunteers rang more than 1,100 hours at Wal-Mart (north and east), Kmart, Safeway, Sam's Club, King Soopers (north and south) and Hays Market. Had we filled all the available ringing slots, we could have rung 2,300 hours — so there is opportunity for us to reach more donors. This year we are adding three additional ringing sites: downtown Safeway, Macy's and Hobby Lobby. Please consider ringing. We ask our volunteers to ring in two-hour shifts, but even a one-hour shift would be helpful. At times people perceive that possibly all the slots are taken and don't attempt to schedule a time. We always have slots available for ringing. So, if you are inclined to ring, please call 970-699-8380 or email us at iwant2ring@msn.com. Ringing for the Salvation Army is really ringing for Loveland/Berthoud. It is one way a person can give back to his/her community. In a time when having additional money to donate might be difficult, you might want to consider "donating" two hours of ringing time. Advertisement Dan R. Lucero Loveland Dan R. Lucero is the advisory committee chairman for the Loveland/Berthoud Salvation Army.

Although Nintendo has announced, via Twitter, the company plans to provide a “steady flow of additional systems through the holiday shopping season and into the new year,” it’s like the Pokémon GO Plus launch and amiibo hunting all over again. If you’re trying to figure out how to find a NES Classic Edition near you, this handy buyer’s guide is outfitted with all the tips and tricks to help you get one. There will be a steady flow of additional systems through the holiday shopping season and into the new year. 2/3 — Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) November 11, 2016 NES Classic Edition at Best Buy Best Buy is selling the mini console in their stores and online. A dedicated product page on their website can be used to check the online availability; but, as of this writing, the product is sold out online and the page does not display the option to search local inventory as it typically does for products sold at their stores. You can try asking an associate at guest services or in the gaming department if they can check the local availability using the SKU number of 5389100. Savvy shoppers can also use the latest version of the Best Buy mobile app as a workaround to check for inventory at their local stores. Simply search for “NES Classic” within the app, and both the online store inventory and specified local inventory will be displayed in two separate tabs. Change your preferred store location to check inventory at the stores in your area an hour or two before stores open, so you can be one of the first in line if a store location is showing they’ve got some in. The Nintendo Entertainment system is now being sold as a handheld mini-console that comes with 30 pre-installed classic games. [Photo by Nintendo] NES Classic Edition at Target Asking an associate to perform a quick stock check might be the best bet at Target stores, as the console seems to be completely removed from both their mobile app and online store. It has a Store Item Number (DPCI) of 207-29-0180. NES Classic Edition at Toys “R” Us Toys “R” Us seems to be taking a similar approach to Target, as their website no longer lists the item online either. Asking politely in-store when it’s not busy may point you in the right direction. The console has an “R” Web Number of 099263 and and SKU of A24B3213. NES Classic Edition at Walmart Walmart just added a new “search my store” feature to their mobile app, which could potentially be helpful if you find yourself passing through on a routine shopping visit. To find out when the product has been restocked online, they offer an in-stock alert service that sends out an email to share the good news. The NES Classic Edition is also being bundled with an additional controller at some retailers. [Photo by Nintendo] NES Classic Edition at GameStop GameStop is offering several bundles in addition to the standalone console, which means there are a few more options to keep track of in their online store. There’s a bundle with one extra controller that costs about the same as buying the console and additional controller separately, a bundle that includes the mini console and the hardcover Playing with Power book, and another bundle that adds on both the book and extra controller. The “ultimate” bundle comes with all of the above, plus a backpack shaped like the NES. Although the website says the small console is being sold “online only,” there are reports of it being sold in stores as well. Your best bet with this retailer is to call or walk into your local store to inquire about local product inventory. If you strike out in your area, you can also ask if they are taking down a list of customers to call when shipments come in, but your mileage may vary by store. We're out of stock on the NES Classic Edition. We will let you know when we get more in stock. — Amazon Video Games (@amazongames) November 11, 2016 NES Classic Edition at Amazon If you’re not following Amazon.com’s official video game Twitter account, now might be the time to consider doing so. The online retailer alerts shoppers of when major products will be going on sale via their @amazongames account, and a recent tweet confirms they will be informing the masses of the next restock. In the meantime, get prepared for the moment of legend by making sure your account information is all up-to-date, so you can log in and check out as quickly as possible. The #NESClassicEdition is now on sale at #NintendoNYC! pic.twitter.com/npN5YnKNpj — Nintendo NY (@NintendoNYC) November 11, 2016 Nintendo World Store and Other Retailers Residents of New York were treated to a midnight launch party for the mini Nintendo Entertainment System at the one-of-a-kind Nintendo New York store (formally the Nintendo World Store). After selling out at the launch event, additional units were made available on the following Saturday, but also quickly sold out. On the bright side, the Nintendo New York store has been updating their social media accounts to notify fans about the restocks, so they can plan accordingly. As far as other shops go, Newegg.com was briefly selling the NES Classic but has since taken down its page for the item. The same goes for electronics retailer Fry’s Electronics. Micro Center has kept their product page up, along with the tool that allows you to search in-store inventory for all their locations nationwide. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qAGVilt3Rls?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> [Featured Image by Nintendo] Now Watch This: Company Recreates Real life Space Invaders Game Now Read This: Play ‘The Elder Scrolls Online’ For Free This Weekend On PlayStation 4 And PC, Xbox One Free Weekend Coming Soon Share 124 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 Author Asma M Tags: how to find a NES Classic Edition, how to get a NES Classic Edition, NES Classic Edition, nintendo Comments LATEST HEADLINES Steve Bannon: The Most Dangerous Political Operative Gets Free Pass Into The White House, Why America Should Be Very Afraid [Opinion] See ‘Sing’ For Free Thanksgiving Weekend; Universal Pictures Biggest Advance-Screening Program Ever Jax Taylor Shares Thoughts On Marriage, Babies With Brittany Cartwright ‘Minecraft’ Movie: Will Steve Carell Play Steve?

The home center's role is not one you would might have expected from this acquisition. Rich Duprey (TMFCop) Nov 13, 2016 at 4:06PM When coatings giant Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) wanted to buy Mexican paint retailer Comex a few years ago, antitrust regulators south of the border feared that the size and reach of the combined company would hurt competition, and they killed the merger. Now Sherwin-Williams' newest attempt at buying a rival is also said to be criticized by regulators, but this time, they're apparently waiting to see what big-box do-it-yourself retailer Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) thinks about the acquisition. Sherwin-Williams is the leading pro paint specialist, which is looking to have a greater global presence by buying industry rival Valspar. Image source: Getty Images. Cover the world The paint specialist announced back in March that it wanted to buy rival Valspar (NYSE:VAL) in a deal valued at $11 billion, including debt, in a bid to expand its geographic reach. Where Sherwin-Williams generates some 84% of its revenues from domestic markets, Valspar derived 46% of its $4.4 billion in annual revenues last year from international markets. That was also part of the rationale behind the Comex bid, but antitrust regulators blocked the deal.  The Valspar deal also faces some antitrust hurdles. First, Sherwin-Williams sells most of its paint through its branded retail stores, and then mostly to professionals, but in a deal with HGTV two years ago, it began selling paint in Lowe's DIY centers, which gave it greater access to the consumer markets. That came just as Valspar began losing sales at Lowe's, and in its fiscal 2016 third quarter that ended July 31, it said that $39 million, or 40% of the $96 million drop in sales it has experienced year to date, has come from adjusting its product line at the DIY center, a reset that's been going on for well over a year now. The problem for Valspar's merger with Sherwin-Williams, then, is that it will combine Lowe's two paint sellers into one, and according to the New York Post late last month, the Federal Trade Commission has not yet heard from the retailer how it feels about the deal. Image source: Getty Images. A narrow palette to choose from Although about 60% of all paint purchased in the U.S. is bought by professionals, Lowe's and rival Home Depot (NYSE:HD) are among the biggest retailers to the consumer market, along with mass merchandisers like Wal-Mart, an outlet Sherwin-Williams lost in 2010 when Akzo Nobel, which made Dutch Boy brand paints, beat out the coatings specialist, a loss of about $250 million worth of revenue at the time.   PPG Industries (NYSE:PPG) ended up buying Akzo's North American coatings business in 2013, and that put its Glidden brand in place at Wal-Mart, but also at Home Depot, and the Akzo acquisition gave it access to the home center's professional paint business, too. There are a lot of moving parts in the coatings industry and, as is apparent, there has been a bit of consolidation underway. Both Sherwin-Williams and Valspar did expect there would be some resistance from regulators to their merger as the deal between them said they'd be willing to divest assets worth up to $650 million of Valspar's 2015 revenue. Image source: Flickr via Scott Lewis. However, the deal also said that if Sherwin-Williams was required to divest assets that accounted for more than that, the offer price would fall from $113 per share to $105 per share. Further, if divestitures of more than $1.5 billion were required, Sherwin-Williams would have the right to back out of the deal completely. A closer look Back in May, the FTC extended its review of the merger and wanted more information, sending a second request for information, a not-unheard-of circumstance and one that's by no means a deal-killer. Last year, for example, Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) was asked for more information regarding its merger with Miller that was ultimately approved, albeit with more asset sales demanded and greater restrictions imposed. That could happen here as well, which may change the color of the agreement between Sherwin-Williams and Valspar. What they may not have counted on, though, was Lowe's being the linchpin to the deal, as the Post story says if the retailer objects to the merger because they would gain too much pricing power, it might cause antitrust regulators to spike the union. While Sherwin-Williams and Valspar say there's nothing to the story, you can bet they'd see red if the FTC blacks out the merger. Editor's note: A previous version of this article contained incorrect information about Sherwin-Williams' presence in Mexico. Rich Duprey has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Conroy’s Party Shop, for the second straight year, hosted a Thanksgiving-themed celebration on Sunday to thank their customers for their support. “The owner just wanted to show customer appreciation — just to show that he appreciates his customers,” said Victoria Allen, event organizer. “It is because of the customers that he is allowed to put this on.” That “thank you” came in the form of free haircuts, thanksgiving dinners and a massive turkey giveaway. “We purchased them from Walmart,” Allen said. “We had 150 and we’re giving them away. No strings attached. We’re asking that it’s one per family.” Conroy’s customers said they are impressed and grateful. “Its fantastic,” community member Annette Alexander said. “I’m glad he contributed to the neighborhood and gave back to everybody who contributes to his store.” Over on the northside of Youngstown, a similar event is in the works. The Youngstown RedZone is hosting a free community Thanksgiving dinner on Nov. 19. And their event, just like Conroy’s, is all about giving back. “WFocus this event totally on the community, said Brandon Perry, co-owner of the RedZone. “They provided the donations we need to make this event possible.” Perry said that it’s important to have a business that invests in the community. “If you need help, you can just knock on the door or ring the doorbell,” he said. “We will answer and provide you what you need. We’re not just going to take from you and not provide you something back. That’s our thing — we’re trying to give something in return.” And that in the spirit of thanksgiving, there is nothing more important than coming together. “To come together is just so powerful,” Perry said. “It’s very important that we show unity — no matter your race, gender or any of that. We just want to show everyone that we can get together and make something happen.” The RedZone is still accepting any and all food donations for their Thanksgiving Dinner.

Police: Surveillance video helps ID teen burglary suspects Associated Press | NEWARK, Del. (AP) — New Castle County police say surveillance photos posted to social media helped them identify two teenage burglary suspects. Police are looking for 18-year-old Kyle Mace and 18-year-old Hunter Foltz in the burglary of a Newark-area home on Thursday. They were identified with the help of images from surveillance videos taken at a Wal-Mart in Wilmington where police say stolen credit cards were used. Police say two women who were also shown in the surveillance images have cooperated with investigators. Police say the teens are also suspected in the theft of a car, and they're believed to be responsible for thefts from several other vehicles in the communities of North Star and Jarrell Farms. They've been charged in warrants with several counts of burglary, theft and conspiracy. © 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

We examine the shareholder's recipe for change. Asit Sharma (TMFfinosus) Nov 13, 2016 at 3:02PM Ninety-six seconds of sales genius. Video source: The YouTube channel of "Ginsuguy." Perhaps you're old enough to remember the famous "Ginsu Knife" TV ad, which launched the modern infomercial. If not, you've undoubtedly heard some version of its signature phrase -- "Wait, there's much, much more!" -- which has morphed into a contemporary shorthand for signaling any over-the-top sales pitch. The "Ginsu" moniker was actually a rebranding of a high-quality knife manufactured in Arkansas, which had previously been known by the unimaginative name "Quikut." The kitschy spot, which first aired in the late 1970s, has become a case study in persuasion: A Japanese chef is shown using a Ginsu to slice through frozen spinach, saw a beer can in two, and chip away at wood blocks, while demonstrating how the blade always remains razor sharp after such imaginative punishments.  I was reminded of this commercial after reading about the angst of one of Whole Foods Market, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:WFM) largest shareholders, as reported by Bloomberg News earlier this month. The shareholder, as yet unnamed, is said to have held meetings with activist investors to effect major change at the natural foods grocer, which could include a replacement of current management and/or exploring a sale of the company. Such news shouldn't completely surprise anyone. Whole Foods has struggled to reverse a comparable-store-sales decline that's now roughly two years old. Company stock, stuck in a thick paste of investor skepticism given rising competition, has lost roughly half its value since February 2015. What does this institutional shareholder, who prefers anonymity and would have others do its heavy lifting, want specifically? According to the obligatory "people familiar with the matter," who were present at discussions but also with to remain anonymous: "The investor cited Whole Foods' poor inventory and vendor management, high costs, and failure to make the most of its unique appeal to millennial shoppers among the key issues." Aimed at an aggressive hedge fund activist or two, these points form a seductive sales pitch. The identified issues lend themselves to wide-scale changes, which, if enacted by a capable agitator, aim to send shareholder value on a sharp upward tack.  Of course, knowing that change needs to happen doesn't ensure that you'll be able to put your index finger on the correct problems. In this case, the complaints relayed to Bloomberg don't appear to be connected with the company's current reality.  And selling the business, or ridding Whole Foods of executives who built an industry-leading value proposition, makes for an extremely sharp knife to wield. Let's take a look at these grievances. Inventory is a strength, not a shortcoming, of Whole Foods Market Grocers work incessantly to avoid shrink (wastage), and also to move inventory faster. Cycling inventory through a company quickly has tangible benefits, including the reduction of inventory holding costs, and a faster conversion of products for sale into cash. Whole Foods' management team realizes that opportunities exist to reduce shrink, especially in perishables such as fruit and vegetables. It's also dedicated to moving packaged goods out of back areas and on to store shelves more quickly. In the spring of 2016, executives disclosed an initiative to set up standard operating procedures to optimize inventory handling across all of Whole Foods' stores. Individual locations have previously enjoyed autonomy in this area. Yet everything's relative: One company's benchmarks for improvement may well prove out of reach for another in the same sector. Believe it or not, inventory management is one of the unsung, signatory achievements of Whole Foods Market. You can see this in a calculation that seeks to measure a combination of inventory efficiency and profitability: the "Turn/Earn" index. This is found by multiplying the number of times a company replenishes its aggregate inventory annually (inventory turnover) by gross margin. I've compared Whole Foods to a broad range of competitors: Grocer Inventory Turnover Gross Margin Turn / Earn Index (Rounded) Whole Foods Market 30.92 34.41 1,064 Casey's General Stores 35.41 22.66 802 Sprouts Farmers Market 23.31 29.27 682 Kroger 18.53 22.16 411 Weis Markets 12.27 27.35 336 Natural Grocers 9.38 29.15 273 Wal-Mart Stores 10.76 25.13 270 Supervalu 17.36 14.74 256 Index calculated by author based on Ycharts data. Note that gross margin percentages are converted to whole numbers to arrive at an index value. You'll observe that the organic-foods pioneer has the second fastest inventory turnover in the group, and the highest gross margin. Whole Foods has many issues to work on, but inventory management really isn't one of them. The company's indexed measurement of efficiency and profitability is 33% higher than that of its nearest competitor, and its score is simply out of reach of the rest of the peers in the table. This has more than a little to do with the fact that Whole Foods is extremely good at converting the same meats, dairy, and greens it sells on shelves and counters into prepared foods and hot bar items, incurring relatively little waste, which customers then buy at an even higher margin.  Vendor management, also cited by the anonymous investor, is a key part of the company's brand proposition. Whole Foods cultivates its vendors within extremely long-lasting relationships, pushing them to improve scores on its various sustainability rating scales, an important process in the eye of its socially conscious customers. Sure, the company could see some efficiency improvements in this area. Yet overall, without extremely well-managed relationships within its supply chain, Whole Foods simply wouldn't be able to achieve its breakneck inventory turnover of nearly 31 times annually. As for the high costs mentioned in the Bloomberg article, these are concentrated in Whole Foods' sales, general, and administrative expenses. It's a valid area of improvement that management has only recently addressed in a dedicated manner. I've discussed results of initial cost-cutting in an analysis of the company's Nov. 9 quarterly report, which you can read here. Whole Foods doesn't have a unique opportunity with millennials The anonymous shareholder is also correct to point out that Whole Foods has a millennial problem. But so does nearly every other grocer in the business. A recent article by Derek Thompson of The Atlantic -- "Why Do Millennials Hate Groceries?" -- suggests that millennials, and their elders for that matter, are booking fewer visits to grocery stores because they're eating a higher percentage of their meals at restaurants.  To this insight we should add the well-documented tight-fistedness of this demographic. Many millennials came of age and formed thrifty habits during the Great Recession, which means that dollar stores and discount chains grab a disproportionate share of their shopping budget. Accordingly, several marketing research reports over the past three years have indicated that millennials' grocer of choice isn't Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, or some other forward, hip chain. Rather, it's the ubiquitous and cheap Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT). Wal-Mart's own data tends to support this research. In March 2016, Chief Merchandising Officer Steve Bratspies told analysts at an industry conference that fully one-third of U.S. millennials between 20 and 35 had shopped at a Wal-Mart in the past month. While it may be counterintuitive to realize, millennials, who do tend to favor sustainably sourced, natural and organic products, and share affinity with the Whole Foods brand, don't inherently present any "unique opportunities" to the company as a shopping consortium. To state so reveals a lack of understanding that this demographic is currently price-driven over any other single shopping consideration. There is one characteristic grocers and shareholders understand and probably agree upon regarding this group: Millennials use technology to shop to a much higher extent than older generations. The following graphic, from the Food Marketing Institute's 2016 U.S. Grocery Shopping Trends report, demonstrates how much more actively millennials exhibit technology-centric purchase behaviors versus any other group: Image source: Hartman Group / FMI.org. Whole Foods' attempt to appeal to these digital natives' purchasing habits while offering lower prices has of course materialized in its "365 By Whole Foods" concept. With a handful of these tech-savvy, discount-friendly stores in operation, and 19 in its development pipeline, the company is actually pretty actively courting the youngest U.S. shoppers, while taking care to avoid cannibalization of its core business. A dubious course of action? To be clear, Whole Foods' central issues remain its market positioning against new competition, maintenance of pricing power, and top-line growth. None of these can be righted overnight, though each is currently being addressed. And none of these problems is likely to be solved by an activist investor who chooses to attack inventory or costs, or get rid of the same management team that's built what remains one of the most profitable grocery operations in the industry.  Selling the business doesn't seem a viable option at present to me, either. I'm not sure any single competitor big enough to buy Whole Foods -- of which there are but a handful -- has a better solution to the company's core problems. This imbues a fairly large potential transaction with risk.  Forcing constructive change in an enterprise shouldn't be frowned upon. But attempting to push questionable initiatives out of frustration may end up destroying more value than it creates. And it's worth noting that the company, as of the last two quarters, is showing concrete signs of a reversal of its comps trend decline. Activists, are you listening to a persuasive sales pitch and being asked to wield an extremely sharp knife? Be careful what you saw through.

The home center's role is not one you would might have expected from this acquisition. Rich Duprey (TMFCop) Nov 13, 2016 at 4:06PM When coatings giant Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) wanted to buy Mexican paint retailer Comex a few years ago, antitrust regulators south of the border feared that the size and reach of the combined company would hurt competition, and they killed the merger. Now Sherwin-Williams' newest attempt at buying a rival is also said to be criticized by regulators, but this time, they're apparently waiting to see what big-box do-it-yourself retailer Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) thinks about the acquisition. Sherwin-Williams is the leading pro paint specialist, which is looking to have a greater global presence by buying industry rival Valspar. Image source: Getty Images. Cover the world The paint specialist announced back in March that it wanted to buy rival Valspar (NYSE:VAL) in a deal valued at $11 billion, including debt, in a bid to expand its geographic reach. Where Sherwin-Williams generates some 84% of its revenues from domestic markets, Valspar derived 46% of its $4.4 billion in annual revenues last year from international markets. That was also part of the rationale behind the Comex bid, but antitrust regulators blocked the deal.  The Valspar deal also faces some antitrust hurdles. First, Sherwin-Williams sells most of its paint through its branded retail stores, and then mostly to professionals, but in a deal with HGTV two years ago, it began selling paint in Lowe's DIY centers, which gave it greater access to the consumer markets. That came just as Valspar began losing sales at Lowe's, and in its fiscal 2016 third quarter that ended July 31, it said that $39 million, or 40% of the $96 million drop in sales it has experienced year to date, has come from adjusting its product line at the DIY center, a reset that's been going on for well over a year now. The problem for Valspar's merger with Sherwin-Williams, then, is that it will combine Lowe's two paint sellers into one, and according to the New York Post late last month, the Federal Trade Commission has not yet heard from the retailer how it feels about the deal. Image source: Getty Images. A narrow palette to choose from Although about 60% of all paint purchased in the U.S. is bought by professionals, Lowe's and rival Home Depot (NYSE:HD) are among the biggest retailers to the consumer market, along with mass merchandisers like Wal-Mart, an outlet Sherwin-Williams lost in 2010 when Akzo Nobel, which made Dutch Boy brand paints, beat out the coatings specialist, a loss of about $250 million worth of revenue at the time.   PPG Industries (NYSE:PPG) ended up buying Akzo's North American coatings business in 2013, and that put its Glidden brand in place at Wal-Mart, but also at Home Depot, and the Akzo acquisition gave it access to the home center's professional paint business, too. There are a lot of moving parts in the coatings industry and, as is apparent, there has been a bit of consolidation underway. Both Sherwin-Williams and Valspar did expect there would be some resistance from regulators to their merger as the deal between them said they'd be willing to divest assets worth up to $650 million of Valspar's 2015 revenue. Image source: Flickr via Scott Lewis. However, the deal also said that if Sherwin-Williams was required to divest assets that accounted for more than that, the offer price would fall from $113 per share to $105 per share. Further, if divestitures of more than $1.5 billion were required, Sherwin-Williams would have the right to back out of the deal completely. A closer look Back in May, the FTC extended its review of the merger and wanted more information, sending a second request for information, a not-unheard-of circumstance and one that's by no means a deal-killer. Last year, for example, Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) was asked for more information regarding its merger with Miller that was ultimately approved, albeit with more asset sales demanded and greater restrictions imposed. That could happen here as well, which may change the color of the agreement between Sherwin-Williams and Valspar. What they may not have counted on, though, was Lowe's being the linchpin to the deal, as the Post story says if the retailer objects to the merger because they would gain too much pricing power, it might cause antitrust regulators to spike the union. While Sherwin-Williams and Valspar say there's nothing to the story, you can bet they'd see red if the FTC blacks out the merger. Editor's note: A previous version of this article contained incorrect information about Sherwin-Williams' presence in Mexico. Rich Duprey has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Thanksgiving 2016, which will take place on November 24, is actually the start date for many Black Friday sales this year. Retailers are pushing their events forward more and more, and it is essential that you are aware of the hours for all of the major stores. To add to the confusion, some stores will start their online sales even earlier. Most will begin at 12 a.m. on Thanksgiving morning, but others will start on Wednesday. A rare few will even start on Monday, so it is important to be prepared the entire week. You can see a full selection of Black Friday and Thanksgiving store hours at BestBlackFriday.com, but here are the important ones.

For those retailers, Thanksgiving is technically the start of their Black Friday sale. Bass Pro Shops – Thanksgiving 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. and 5 a.m. to 11 a.m. Friday for doorbusters Best Buy – Thanksgiving 5 p.m. to 1 a.m. and 8 a.m. Friday doorbusters Bon-Ton – Thanksgiving 5 p.m. to 3 p.m. Friday Dick’s Sporting Goods – Thanksgiving 6 p.m. to 2 p.m. Friday Dollar General – Thanksgiving 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Five Below – Thanksgiving 6 p.m. to 1 a.m. and 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. Friday JCPenney – Thanksgiving 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. Friday Kohl’s – Thanksgiving 6 p.m. to 1 p.m. Friday for doorbusters Kmart – Thanksgiving 7 pm. to 2 p.m. Friday (Kmart could announce Thursday morning doorbusters) Macy’s – Thanksgiving 5 p.m. to 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. Friday Michael’s – Thanksgiving 6 p.m. to Midnight and 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Friday Modell’s – Thanksgiving 6 p.m. to 2 p.m. Friday (hours vary by state/county) Old Navy – Thanksgiving 4 p.m to Midnight Friday Sears – Thanksgiving 6 p.m. to Midnight and 5 a.m. on Friday Shopko – Thanksgiving 4 p.m. to 1 p.m. Friday Stage Stores – Thanksgiving 12 p.m. to 1 a.m. and 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. Friday Stein Mart – Thanksgiving 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Friday Target – Thanksgiving 6 p.m. to 10 p.m., 11 p.m., or Midnight on Friday Toys R Us – Thanksgiving 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. Friday Walgreens – Thanksgiving 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. to Midnight Friday Walmart – Thanksgiving 6 p.m. (sales begin at this time.

Black Friday Free Shipping Information When you know you're going home to a doorstep full of #AmazonPrime boxes… #MondayMotivation pic.twitter.com/hyBkOhvxM1 — Amazon (@amazon) November 7, 2016 With more doorbusters available on Thanksgiving and Black Friday than ever, it is important that you avoid paying shipping charges. In many instances, retailers will have a minimum order size that you have to meet in order to qualify for free shipping. This usually ranges from $35 to $75, and it completely depends on the store in question. Since most small orders will not meet the minimum, paying shipping charges could eat up most of the discount that you receive on Black Friday. For that reason, it is recommended that you do not pay shipping charges on Thanksgiving, Black Friday, or Cyber Monday. Here are the free shipping terms for a few of the more popular stores. Amazon – Minimum Order Size of $49 or a Prime membership, which requires an annual fee of $99. Best Buy – No Minimum Order Size. Kohl’s – Minimum Order Size of $75, which is one of the higher totals. Target – No Minimum Order Size. Toys R Us – Minimum Order Size of $19. Walmart – $50 Minimum Order Size or a ShippingPass membership, which requires an annual fee of $49. Best Buy and Target have the best policies, with Kohl’s having the worst. Amazon and Walmart are looking to push their shipping programs, so they are not offering free shipping with no minimum order size this year. While each requires an annual fee, you will receive free two-day shipping, which cannot be said for Best Buy and Target’s free shipping offers.

The National Retail Federation says consumers plan to spend an average of $935.58 during the holiday shopping season - the second highest level on record. Whether that is a little or a lot for you, we have some expert tips on how to find a comfortable spending level and stick to it this year: ASSESS FILE - In this Wednesday, Oct. 26, 2016, file photo, Choisette Hargon, of Paterson, N.J., shops for toys ahead of Christmas at Wal-Mart in Teterboro, N.J. It¿s easy to get caught up in the excitement of holiday shopping, but it¿s not always as easy to foot the bill. The National Retail Federation says consumers plan to spend an average of $935.58 during the holiday shopping season, which is the second highest level on record. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez, File) Be honest with yourself about your financial situation before you begin. If you are already struggling to pay bills or carrying debt, you probably shouldn't take on more. Avoid extreme measures to pay for the holidays. A recent survey of more than 1,000 parents by T. Rowe Price found that while the bulk save for the holidays throughout the year, about a quarter have at some point pulled money from their retirement account, emergency fund or taken a payday loan to cover holiday spending. Not sure where you stand? The National Foundation for Credit Counseling has a website that can help you assess your financial well-being before you start to buy at www.MyHolidayCheckUp.org . TALK Start by saying "no" to some of the more costly holiday traditions that might bust the budget, said Bruce McClary of NFCC. It can be hard to challenge those expectations, but it will be even harder to dig yourself out of a financial hole. Parents have a particularly hard time when it comes to their kids, said Marty Allenbaugh, a financial planner at T. Rowe Price. He said that parents sometimes find it easier to get everything on a child's wish list rather than have a more challenging conversation about wants and needs. This is a big mistake as these talks can help them develop a better understanding about money. That doesn't mean you have to be a scrooge though. "It's OK to splurge a little, but just don't go overboard at the expense of your own well-being," Allenbaugh said. BUDGET Set and stick to a holiday spending budget. The first part is easy: figure out how much you want to spend and keep track of your expenses as you go. The second part is harder: sticking to this once you are in the store or online and get excited about the deals. To combat this, Heather Battison of TransUnion suggests writing your budget and shopping list out and carrying it with you or putting it on your smartphone as a reminder. BE SAVVY Credit cards are one of the most popular ways to pay for holiday gifts and that's fine, unless you cannot pay it off immediately. Think twice before accepting the offer for a store card at checkout, as those often have very high interest rates. They also have low spending limits, which can increase your utilization rate — the amount of available credit that you use. And that can hurt your credit score.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Cyber Monday 2016 Deals Forced To Change Posted: Nov 13 2016, 10:43am CST | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Nov 15 2016, 10:52pm CST, in News | Cyber Monday   This story may contain affiliate links. Photo Credit: Getty Images   Advertised Black Friday 2016 deals leave no room for Cyber Monday deals this year. New kind of Cyber Monday deals expected. Site-wide discounts? Besides Amazon, Microsoft and a few other big retailer, all Black Friday 2016 ads have been divulged. What is striking is the amount of deals on high-end consumer electronics. Don't Miss: Best Walmart Black Friday 2016 Deals The Black Friday ads of Best Buy, Walmart, Target and others are full with deals on 4K TVs and mid-range to high-end laptops. Advertised deals for Black Friday also include Apple products including iMac, Macbook, iPhone, iPad Air, iPad mini and iPad Pro. There is nothing really left for Cyber Monday, besides a variation of the deals on the same type of products. In the past years, retailers offered predominantly deals on higher end products on Cyber Monday. The Cyber Monday deals also lacked the low ball doorbuster offers that are a main stable for Black Friday. See the Cyber Monday deals from last year. Maybe we will see more radical Cyber Monday deals as offered last year by Target. The Target Cyber Monday deal was a 15% site-wide discount. Best Buy seems to have the biggest issue this year, making Cyber Monday deals stand out. Last year's Cyber Monday deals are pretty much part of this year's Best Buy Black Friday deals. A site-wide discount on everything on bestbuy.com would turn heads. The Cyber Monday 2016 ads and deals are expected to be released in the days ahead of Black Friday. It will be very interesting to see how Walmart, Best Buy, Amazon, Target and others solve the problem and keep Cyber Monday relevant. Update: The full Dell Cyber Monday 2016 Ad is available as of November 16, listing all Dell Cyber deals. The ad confirms that Cyber Monday deals this year look pretty much like Black Friday deals. Cyber Monday lost its identity through the type of deals shoppers can get on the biggest online sales day in the United States. The online sales on Thanksgiving Day grow every year. The the overall online sales on Thanksgiving Day reached $1.73 billion, up 25% from last year. Cyber Monday set a new record in 2015 with $2.98 billion, but the sales volume only grow 12%. Thanksgiving Day is only a about a Billion behind and with the quality and hype around 4K TVs, the Thanksgiving Day online sales will set a new recording closing in on Cyber Monday. Cyber Monday 2016 is on November 28. Many retailers will kick off Cyber Monday sales events right after Black Friday ends.

A: Your basis also splits 2-for-1. Imagine that you bought 100 shares of Acme Explosives Co. (ticker: KBOOM) for $50 each, paying a $10 commission. Your cost basis is $5,010 — or $50.10 per share. After the split, you have 200 shares and your basis is still $5,010, or $25.05 per share. Always add the purchase commission to your cost basis and subtract the sale commission from your proceeds — you’ll save a few tax dollars that way. If you’re paying much more than $10 per trade in commissions, you might want to find a less expensive brokerage.

Q: What is a stock’s “multiple”? A: A “multiple” usually reflects a stock’s price being compared to something. The most common multiple is arguably the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, arrived at by dividing a stock’s current price by its earnings per share. Imagine Sisyphus Transport Corp. (ticker: UPDWN), a company trading at $60 per share. If it earned $3 per share over the past year, its P/E is 20 (60 divided by 3). You can refer to it as trading at an earnings multiple of 20. If you read analyses of various companies, you’ll see references to price-to-sales multiples, book-value multiples, cash-flow multiples and more. It’s instructive to compare a company’s multiples with those of its peers, to see whether its stock appears to be undervalued or overvalued. Target, for example, recently sported a P/E of 12.4, while Wal-Mart’s was 14.7. That suggests Target is the better bargain. Out of commission Dear Fool: I’ve had some bad results in my investing, but the most annoying mistake I made happened when I first started. I bought one share of stock in each of four companies. That was all the money I had at the time. Years later, the stocks were way down, and I no longer wanted to even own them. Making matters worse, the commission fees of buying and selling one share amounted to more than the cost of the share. I really want to yell at anyone who recommends buying just one share of stock in order to get into investing. The Fool responds: It’s important to pay attention to the commission fees you pay. These days plenty of good brokerages charge $7 or $10 or less per trade, but commissions of $25 or more haven’t been that uncommon in years past. If you buy $100 worth of stock and pay a $25 commission, you’re forking over 25 percent of the value of your investment just in commissions. We suggest paying no more than 2 percent, so if you’re paying $10 per trade, you’ll want your investment to be worth at least $500. High quality and growth If you’ve been assuming that The Priceline Group (Nasdaq: PCLN) is just another “me too” travel site, you’re wrong. It actually runs a collection of industry-leading enterprises such as Kayak.com, Rentalcars.com and OpenTable.com — and its crown jewel is Booking.com. Booking.com is the leading player in online travel in Europe. As the European hotel market is fragmented, many hotels are run by individual owners who lack the expertise and scale to market their hotel to online travelers. Thus, they’ve happily signed on to Booking.com’s platform to help fill rooms. This is a win-win relationship, and since Booking.com was the first mover in Europe, it has built a massive network of properties. That makes it the go-to site for millions of travelers who want the biggest selection of hotels, which in turn attracts more properties. That powerful network effect helps keep competitors at bay. Booking.com’s success is a big reason that Priceline Group’s profits have grown so quickly. Over the last five years, profits have compounded at more than 20 percent annually. Better yet, analysts are currently projecting more than 16 percent growth annually over the next five years. Priceline’s forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio near 18 might not seem “cheap,” but it seems a fair price to pay for a wonderful business that’s poised for prosperity.

To find out why one corner of our country voted as it did, Senior Correspondent Ted Koppel traveled deep into the heart of Trump Country: McDowell County, West Virginia, echoes to the sound of “used to be’s.” There used to be a hundred thousand people in the county.  Used to be.  Back when the coal mines ran three shifts a day. That’s another used to be. Automation cut back the work force.  Machines replaced men. That was already an issue back in 1960, when John F. Kennedy was campaigning here: Coal Miner: “What are your plans for the situation existing in the coal mines in West Virginia?” Kennedy:  “I think there are at least four or five things the government can do.  First is the area redevelopment bill.” JFK carried the county, and the state. Folks here used to be staunch Democrats. Used to be. “Well, I graduated from high school over here in 1973 and it was bustling then,” said Sheriff Martin West. “The streets were full, the businesses were here, and then I got laid off in ‘82. That’s when the bottom went out.” McDowell County today, says Sheriff West, is in desperate straits. “This county was one of the most prosperous in the state at one time,” he told Koppel. “These were the billion-dollar coalfields, and they were just enjoying the richness of it. And now we’re on the bottom and we’re being totally neglected.” Most of the mines are closed now, and the county’s down to fewer than 19,000 residents -- too many of those on welfare and food stamps. Unemployment is more than double the national rate. And there is the property that “used to be” a Walmart.  So, when the voters went to the polls last Tuesday … Trump: “You look at our miners; Hillary Clinton wants to put all of the miners out of business.” “I’d say 90-percent of West Virginia will vote for Donald Trump,” said one voter. “Ain’t gonna say he’s a savior.  If we do have a chance, he could possibly help us out.” McDowell County was, unambiguously, Trump country.  In McDowell County, West Virginia - where coal country voters are in desperate straits - Donald Trump bested Hillary Clinton by a four-to-one margin. CBS News Donald Trump swept West Virginia, and trounced Hillary Clinton in McDowell County by almost four to one (4,614 votes to 1,429). Koppel asked, “You really think things are going to change?” “I think that he can help us, yeah,” replied Sheriff West. He used to work in the mines. Then he spent seven years at a processing plant where they cleaned and sorted the coal that fired the furnaces at U.S. Steel. It’s shut down now. “They put all these regulations onto us from Washington, and the mines is trying to operate,” said Sheriff West. “The people is counting on that in order to feed their family, to pay their bills and obey the regulations that we have. But they keep putting more regulations upon us.” The Sterling Drive-In, established in 1945, is one of the only places left that hasn’t shut down. It’s a good place to talk. Ted Koppel with some Trump and Clinton supporters, at the Sterling Drive-In diner in Welch, West Virginia. CBS News Koppel asked a group of residents, “I want you folks to tell me why it is that people down here in McDowell County were so much smarter than everybody in New York, Washington and Los Angeles, and Chicago. What did you know that we didn’t know?” “Really, to me, Donald Trump is probably the only way this county, and let alone state, is gonna survive,” said Brandon Burks, a correctional officer at Stephens Correctional Center. “I mean, we’ve always been a coal county.” Koppel asked, “Is Donald Trump going to be able to make a difference? Is the coal industry ever gonna come back?” Ed Evans, a science teacher who was recently elected to the Western House of Delegates, said, “It’s not gonna come back to where it was.  I don’t think we’ll see [that] level, but I think we’ll see some return of coal.” Eddie Asbury is President of Southern Minerals Coal Company, which has seven coal mines, three of which are shut down. “It’s not a United States market or state market or a county market, it’s a world market. We gotta compete in the world, in the world.” “And you think Donald Trump’s gonna be able to do that?” Koppel asked. “I do believe he will. And I’ll be honest with you, I’ve been Democrat all my life. All my life.” Leroy Johnson used to work in one of Eddie Asbury’s mines. But when it comes to politics they part ways. “I voted for Hillary because she was more experienced and she was talking about more of the policies that we need, and the things that we need to work on,” he said. “Donald wasn’t talking that. He was just throwing words out there, giving people what they wanted to hear. And I didn’t think that was right.” Kristin Mitchem, an unemployed single mother of three young children, did not vote. “Why the hell not?” Koppel asked. “I felt that this was the most ridiculous election I’ve ever witnessed in my life,” Mitchem said. “I know I’m young, but they went about it the most childish way I think someone ever could. Through the whole election I never heard either party talk about the lower class. I’m lower class. They’re worried about middle class and higher class.” “You were born here?” “I was born and raised here.” “So you know a lot of people your own age?” “I do, I do.” “Is there a lot of desperation?” “There truly is. I would never have imagined in my life that I would be in this kind of position,” Mitchem replied. “I don’t wanna leave my home. But I feel as if I’m being forced out of my home because there’s nothing here anymore.” Delores Johnson, Leroy’s wife of nearly four decades, and the President of the McDowell County Chamber of Commerce, nodded her head. Koppel asked, “You see a lot of this?” “Yes. And I agree with what she’s saying. It’s sad.” “The nuclear family in McDowell County is really broken down,” said Evans. “We have somewhere in the high 40 percent of kids that do not live with their natural mothers and fathers. Most of them will go off to find jobs in other places. They’ll mail money back to grandma who takes care, or Uncle Bill, who takes care of the kids.” “What’s coming out of this community to me is that a lot of people voted for Donald Trump because they felt, ‘What the hell? What have we got to lose?’” said Koppel. “Do you buy that?” Asbury replied, “I do.” Evans added, “We have nowhere to go but up.” There’s a little disagreement about when McDowell County held its first Veterans Day Parade -- either 1918 or 1919 -- but it’s one of the oldest in the country. This last Veteran’s Day, Friday, was picture-perfect. The parade came down McDowell Street and you could barely notice all the shutdown stores. There was a flavor of what it must have been like.  Not everyone, but most people, seemed ready to give their President-elect a real chance. “The voters of McDowell County gave Donald Trump a four-to-one margin of victory, I think ‘cause he said he’s going to bring the coal industry back,” said Koppel. “You think he can do it?” “I think he can do anything he said he could do,” one woman said. “He’s that good.” With the kids chanting their thanks to the veterans, and the high school bands, and the crowds lining either side of the street, you almost had a feeling of how it used to be. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Even so, it’s been impossible for most shoppers not to notice that retailers have rolled out loads of early season deals. Amazon launched the first of its pre-Black Friday sales on Nov. 1, while stores like Best Buy and Target have already promised free no-minimum shipping on all purchases throughout the season, in addition to a range of early discounts and promotions. Many of Walmart’s Black Friday deals are live in stores and online right now as well. Your e-mail in-box is probably brimming with special offers from retailers right about now too. Marketing research indicates that consumers are more likely to open and read promotional retailer e-mails in the two weeks after Halloween than they are later in the holiday shopping season. Why? Apparently, because by December—which is unsurprisingly the peak month of the year for retailer emails—shoppers are swimming in so many promotions that they’re easier to delete. In any event, we are entering the peak season for retailer emails and deals. Perhaps among the most eye-catching of discounts is the simplest one: the flat percentage discount that applies to all of a store’s merchandise. There are plenty of these offers available right now. Through Nov. 17, Old Navy is offering 30% off sitewide, and 50% off winter apparel (use the code WARM at checkout). Dockers has 40% off the purchase of any two items, or 50% off orders of three items (code: FROSTY50). Crocs and J.C. Penney were promoting 30% across-the-board discounts for Veterans Day, while Gap and Banana Republic have been hosting 40% off everything sales. Read Next: Everything You Need to Know About the 2016 Holiday Shopping Season They may seem like pretty good sales. But they speak to how inflated regular prices are at America’s stores, revealing a business model in which insanely high markups mean that no one should ever pay full price—and that you’re probably paying too much even with discounts of 20% or 30% off. More importantly, if you want to pay the least for gifts or treating yourself during the holiday season, you should probably resist all of the deals on the table now. Why? If history is any guide, much more substantial discounts are on the horizon. For example, the flat 30% off promotion at J.C. Penney is paltry compared to the retailer’s average discount of 68% on Black Friday last year. What’s more, retailers are all but guaranteed to repeat the kinds of huge sitewide discounts they’ve offered on Black Fridays and Cyber Mondays in the past. It’s become standard protocol for stores like the ones mentioned above to discount all purchases by 40%, 50%, or even 60% during the long Thanksgiving-Cyber Monday weekend. What’s more, during the weeks in between Cyber Monday and Christmas, there is a history of these exact same kinds of discounts popping up over and over, often with free shipping thrown in to sweeten the deal. So by all means feel free to ignore the deals being breathlessly promoted by retailers right now. The discounts that will be available in the weeks ahead will certainly be just as good—and, odds are, much deeper markdowns will appear periodically on peak sales days like Cyber Monday. Read Next: Stores Realize It’s Dumb to Open Earlier and Earlier on Thanksgiving Perhaps, though, you may not want to ignore the current sales entirely. Instead, consider them a baseline that can be used to compare with the inevitable sales down the line. Create a list of items you want to buy and note their current prices. This way, you can quickly identify the truly outstanding deals in the coming weeks and pounce on them with confidence that you’re getting a bargain.

Pay hikes appeal to working-class voters who lifted Republican Donald Trump to a decisive win in the U.S. presidential race, and also to liberals who voted for Hillary Clinton, worker advocates said. Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 71.42 +0.93 +1.32% Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc CMG ▼ 400.00 -14.18 -3.42% Jack In The Box Inc JACK ▲ 100.95 +0.16 +0.16% Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc RRGB ▼ 53.55 -0.30 -0.56% "This could be a uniting issue," said Saru Jayaraman, co-director of the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United and director of the Food Labor Research Center at University of California, Berkeley. Voters in Arizona, Colorado and Maine voted to raise their minimum wages to $12 by 2020. Washington State agreed to take the minimum wage to $13.50 in the same time span. Jonathan Schleifer, executive director of the Fairness Project, which has supported minimum wage campaigns across the United States, said any near-term federal action was unlikely under Trump but activists were considering a minimum wage campaign in New Jersey. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie vetoed a $15 per hour minimum wage bill this year, calling it a "radical increase." Christie, a stalwart Trump supporter, could have a place in the new administration. "For the next four years ballot initiatives are going to be the only way forward for us to be able to raise the minimum wage for working Americans and their families," Schleifer said. The United Food & Commercial Workers International Union President Marc Perrone said stakeholders of the minimum wage movement, including different labor unions and worker groups, are also looking at Pennslyvania, New Mexico, Massachusetts and Rhode Island for state ballot initiatives. "By January, February next year we are going to start to research so we can prep for the next election cycle." Perrone said selection of states will ultimately depend on what the electorate in each state wants.© REUTERS/Jim Young Demonstrators gather for a protest calling for a $15-an-hour nationwide minimum wage in downtown Chicago Restaurants and retailers are most exposed to minimum wage hikes, as the two largest U.S. employers of low-wage workers. Stephen Anderson, restaurant analyst at Maxim Group, said the latest state minimum wage increases will affect Chipotle Mexican Grill, Jack in the Box and Red Robin Gourmet Burgers the most. Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the largest retailer and private sector employer in the United States, raised its minimum wage for store workers to $10 per hour in 2016. Its rival Target Corp also raised floor wages to $10 an hour. Anderson said the added cost of wage increases might be offset significantly by business-friendly policies championed by Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress. These could include changes to the "Obamacare" healthcare law and a rollback of new rules broadening overtime eligibility. Trump also will have the opportunity to weaken regulations and change the makeup of the National Labor Relations Board. The NLRB is considering, for instance, whether McDonald's Corp is liable for labor law violations by franchisees, and could be required to bargain with workers who unionize. Dan Schlademan, co-director of OUR Walmart, a worker group seeking higher wages and better benefits at Walmart, said: "The bigger concern here for us is what happens with the labor board and the Department of Labor, where Republican control can change important things for workers and make them detrimental." Trump has said he would support a $10 federal minimum wage, adding it should be left up to the states to lead on the issue. The new Washington and Arizona laws also require employers to provide paid sick leave. Maine's successful initiative also would increase base pay for tipped workers. California and New York already passed laws to raise state minimum wages to $15 per hour over time. The results on the minimum wage ballot initiatives show voters are angry and demanding change, said Christine Owens, executive director of the National Employment Law Project. "Voters in red, purple and blue states across the country decisively backed raises to the minimum wage, delivering badly needed raises for 2.3 million workers," she said.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     NASA Will Launch Fleet Of Microsatellites To Track Typhoons And Hurricanes Posted: Nov 13 2016, 5:50am CST | by Hira Bashir, Updated: Nov 13 2016, 5:53am CST, in News | Latest Science News   An artist's impression of one of the eight small satellites deployed in space over a hurricane. Credit: NASA   The first complete orbital mission will track the formation and intensity of tropical systems and help improve hurricane forecasts NASA is set to launch its first hurricane-tracking mission into the space. The mission, named Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS), consists of eight low-cost, microsatellite observatories that will orbit close to the Earth and monitor tropical systems, which will ultimately help improve weather predications and storm forecast.  How To: Find Hatchimals In Stock The mission is scheduled to launch on December 12 from Cape Carnival Air Force Station in Florida. “This is a first-of-its-kind mission,” said Thomas Zurbuchen from NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. “As a constellation of eight spacecraft, CYGNSS will do what a single craft can't in terms of measuring surface wind speeds inside hurricanes and tropical cyclones at high time resolution, to improve our ability to understand and predict how these deadly storms develop.” Previous instruments that were sent into the space had lacked the ability to accurately measure surface winds in the inner cores of the hurricanes as their signals break down in the areas of heavy perception.  CYGNSS mission, however, uses new type of GPS technology that can penetrate through heavy rain and can track the mechanisms of rapidly evolving cyclones, hurricanes and typhoons. Therefore, it is expected to provide more accurate information about wind speeds in and around the tropical systems including regions beneath the eyewall, which are not possible to measure from space with existing instruments.  “Today, we can’t see what’s happening under the rain,” said Chris Ruf, principal investigator for CYGNSS mission. “We can measure the wind outside of the storm cell with present systems. But there’s a gap in our knowledge of cyclone processes in the critical eyewall region of the storm – a gap that will be filled by the CYGNSS data. The models try to predict what is happening under the rain, but they are much less accurate without continuous experimental validation.” The CYGNSS satellites are designed to continuously monitor surface winds over the oceans across Earth's tropical hurricane-belt. Each of the small satellite is capable of observing changes in storms within a second and the ability to track rapid changes in hurricane intensity is critical to accurate hurricane forecasts. The CYGNSS microsatellite observatories are developed and tested by the Southwest Research Institute in Texas and they will begin operations in 2017 Atlantic hurricane season.

Here's a summary of the changes: • In the prepared-foods section, the sandwich counter was removed. Premade sandwiches can be found at the deli. • New to the prepared-foods department: a taqueria, an all-day breakfast bar, and Smoke and Fire, meat and vegetables grilled over wood. • The coffee bar, previously to the right of the entrance, has been moved next to the juice bar. Shoppers can preorder coffee or smoothies by texting 714-916-5449. • The gelato bar and communal seating area have moved. Gelato is sold at the coffee and juice bar. The seating shifted to in front of the cash registers. • Though poke bowls have always been available at the seafood counter, the store plans to add a build-your-own option. • The seafood department has added a larger selection of frozen, prepackaged foods from fish filets to marinated catfish. • Bulk buying was added for spices and teas. • In the heart of the store, aisles have been realigned so they all run parallel for easier shopping cart flow. Open coolers have been replaced with refrigerated doors in various departments such as dairy to improve energy efficiency. • In the meat department, Costco-style value meat packs are available for shoppers who don't have time to order directly from the butcher. • The large craft beer section is arranged like a boutique liquor store with selections organized by beer styles. • Remodeled bathrooms. Source: Whole Foods Market When Whole Foods Market opened a megastore in Tustin in 2007, it boasted premium services from a seafood-grilling center to wine and tea bars. But after surviving a Great Recession that forever changed consumer buying habits, the Orange County store is unveiling a major overhaul to meet consumer demand for chef-driven dining, value, convenience and personalization. The remodeled store, the biggest overhaul since it opened, features easier-to-navigate aisles, a wider selection of takeout foods, order-ahead coffee service, meat value packs, expanded selection of craft beers, a self-serve pizza station and more express checkout lanes. Yet the centerpiece of the year-old makeover has little to do with shopping for GMO-free crackers or organic hemp nut ice cream. In fact, no shopping cart is required. The 60,000-square-foot market, a key anchor at the District shopping center, has added two dining venues: gourmet sandwich chain Mendocino Farms and the Hangar Bar. “We love to turn people on to new foods and new retail experiences,” local marketing executive Marci Frumkin said. DINING DESTINATOINS The changes come as Whole Foods, often nicknamed “Whole Paycheck” for its premium prices, has scrambled to fend off rivals from all fronts. Traditional supermarkets like Ralphs and discounters such as Wal-Mart have ramped up organic private labels over the years. Online retailers like Amazon Fresh are also coming on strong in the $69 billion natural and organic foods market. Grocery and restaurant industries are also competing with a surge in meal-kit delivery programs. Whole Foods has responded, in part, by adding in-store restaurants. Of the Texas-based chain’s 464 stores, 180 have bars or tap rooms, including stores in Laguna Niguel, Newport Beach and Brea. Adding popular branded food chains like Mendocino Farms is the latest iteration of that dining strategy. “It’s an experiment. Whole Foods continues to break boundaries,” said Mario Del Pero, co-founder of Mendocino Farms. On Wednesday, a remodeled store in El Segundo unveiled a Kogi restaurant; it also recently added a bar. The Kogi eatery is popular Los Angeles chef Roy Choi’s second food venue inside a Whole Foods. Last year, the food truck pioneer opened Chego at a downtown Los Angeles store. ARE RESTAURANTS THE RIGHT MOVE? The Mendocino Farms at the Tustin store is the first of several expected to open inside select Whole Foods Markets. The fast-casual concept, which has locations in Orange and Los Angeles counties, is known for creating specialty sandwiches with locally sourced ingredients. The sandwich shop opens Thursday, sharing a 140-seat dining area with Hangar Bar, named after the Tustin blimp hangars. While Mendocino sells sandwiches, salads and stews, the Hangar Bar offers a gastropub-style menu with comfort foods, as well as vegan and vegetarian dishes. Some items include grass-fed beef burgers, fish and chips, sushi rolls, jackfruit crab cakes and cauliflower nachos. Del Pero said the goal of a restaurant within a market is to give time-pressed consumers a variety of eating options – smoked meats, vegan dishes, burgers, all-day breakfast, salads, sushi, pizza and sandwiches. Recently, Emil Davis, 25, and a friend took advantage of the choices. He dined on a house burger, fries and a pint of grapefruit Sculpin IPA at the Hangar Bar, while his friend drank a cold-pressed juice from the store. Davis, who shops and eats at Whole Foods frequently, said he’s happy to see more dining options. “I’ve been waiting for this for a long time,” he said. Industry watcher Brian Todd, president of the Food Institute, said adding restaurants makes sense if Whole Foods is trying to attract Gen Y shoppers, who spend about 44 percent of their food dollars dining out, according to a Food Institute analysis of government data. That’s almost $300 more annually than baby boomers, he said. “And those millennials also like their craft brews, perhaps explaining why Whole Foods and other supermarkets are adding tap rooms and specialty brews where customers can bring their growlers when picking up their dinners, or even a snack,” Todd said. Still, grocery analyst Burt P. Flickinger questioned the bar program. “It just seems really ill-advised,” he said. “It’s an expensive initiative when they have so much more to fix.” Flickinger, managing director of retail consulting firm Strategic Resource Group in New York, recently visited a few taverns and bars inside Whole Foods stores in Texas, Chicago and Orange County. Each time, the stores had very few customers with baseball playoffs on TV, including the Back Bay Tavern at the Whole Foods at Fashion Island. Whole Foods declined to offer sales data on its bars. According to regulatory filings, store shoppers enjoy the chain’s ready-to-eat foods. Prepared foods and bakery accounted for 19 percent, or $3 billion, of the chain’s total sales in 2015. “We find that our customers appreciate being able to come to one place to do everything,” marketing executive Frumkin said. SHIFTING OF SPACE While Flickinger said the Whole Foods dining experiment is a waste of “productive space,” Tustin store leader Chris Cintula said very few grocery services have been eliminated by adding the two restaurants. During a store tour last week, Cintula said departments are now better organized – and in many cases, offer more products. The craft beer aisle, for example, has doubled to 800 types of beers – ranging from 22-ounce bombers from local breweries to obscure brands. The Whole Body department has added more makeup and facial care products. Pet supplies also have increased. Customization and convenience have played a large role in the new layout. Aisles have be realigned so they are parallel, making it easier to navigate. (Some departments were previously boxed in, causing traffic jams). Checkout lanes are no longer stacked with two registers. The Food Institute’s Todd said the changes are a smart move “as time-starved consumers look for ways to provide meals for their families and themselves as quickly and easily as possible.” Changes throughout the chain appear to be helping the bottom line. On Nov. 2, Whole Foods reported fourth-quarter sales increased to a record $3.5 billion. However, same-store sales decreased 2.6 percent, which marked the fifth straight quarter of declines. As for the the next Mendocino Farms inside a Whole Foods, Del Pero said it’s too soon to speculate where it will go. “We’re absolutely going to study it and see how it goes.” Contact the writer: nluna@ocregister.com Related Links Entree classics as sandwiches?

SCHWARTZ < PREVIOUS SLIDESLIDE 1 of 6NEXT SLIDE > Paul Roell, a team leader at Carrier, supported Donald Trump. © Whitten Sabbatini for The New York Times INDIANAPOLIS — By the time the Chicago Cubs won the World Series for the first time in 108 years this month, Paul Roell was already asleep. He did not stay up to see Barack Obama win the presidency in 2008, or watch in 2000 as the margin of votes separating George W. Bush and Al Gore in Florida shrank to the vanishing point. Quotes in the article United Technologies Corp UTX ▼ 107.68 -0.18 -0.17% Rexnord Corp RXN ▲ 20.67 +0.16 +0.78% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 71.42 +0.93 +1.32% After all, he has to clock in daily at 5:30 a.m. at the soon-to-be-shuttered Carrier factory here, where he has worked 17 years. But shortly before 3 a.m. Wednesday, when the networks projected that Donald J. Trump would be the next president of the United States, Mr. Roell was wide awake. His wife, Stephanie, was up, too, and they exchanged high fives in the wee hours. In fact, Mr. Roell was so keyed up, he did not sleep at all that night and headed straight to the plant before sunrise, bleary-eyed but euphoric. “I don’t watch sports, but this was my World Series,” he said. It is precisely this level of enthusiasm, from Mr. Roell and millions of like-minded Americans, that pollsters and the campaign of Hillary Clinton did not appreciate, even though it was vividly on display in February after a video went viral showing furious Carrier workers here learning from management that their jobs would be going abroad. Sign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter Carrier’s decision to move the factory to Monterrey, Mexico, will eliminate 1,400 jobs by 2019. Mr. Trump quickly made the factory Exhibit A in his argument against the trade policies of Republicans and Democrats alike. He cited Carrier again and again on the campaign trail, threatening to phone executives at the company and its parent, United Technologies, and to hit them with 35 percent tariffs on any furnaces and air-conditioners they imported from Mexico. To the cheers of his supporters, he predicted at rallies that Carrier would call him up as president and say, “Sir, we’ve decided to stay in the United States.” Now his supporters expect action. “If he doesn’t pass that tariff, I will vote the other way next time,” warned Nicole Hargrove, who has worked at Carrier for a decade and a half and is not certain what she will do if and when her job goes to Mexico. Carrier isn’t changing its plans. On Friday in a written statement, the company said, “We are making every effort to ease the transition for our Carrier colleagues in Indiana.” The company pointed out that it will finance four-year retraining and educational programs for employees and provide financial help. For Mr. Trump, now comes the hard part. In interviews in recent days and in March, Trump voters here made clear that if he does not follow through on his promises, they are prepared to turn on him, just as they are seemingly punishing Democrats today for not delivering the hope and change voters sought from President Obama after he won as an outsider in 2008. And while Mr. Roell is a conservative, Mr. Trump’s tough talk about Carrier, the economy and the future of American manufacturing jobs also appealed to moderates like Darrell Presley, a steelworker in rural Crawfordsville, Ind., who voted for Mr. Obama in 2008. “He was for change, and said he would take care of the middle class, but he didn’t live up to those expectations,” Mr. Presley said. “I feel like the American people are at the point where they’ve had it, and this was the last chance.” Last Tuesday, blue-collar workers across the industrial heartland hearkened to Mr. Trump’s call, putting states never thought to be in serious play, like Wisconsin and Michigan, in his win column. As president, however, Mr. Trump will face a tough balance. Tariffs and trade wars stand to hurt American workers who make products that are exported to Mexico or China. Few voters will be happy paying more for imported goods. And regardless of who is in the Oval Office, manufacturers are seeing relentless pressure, from investors and rival companies, to automate, replacing workers with machines that do not break down or require health benefits and pension plans. Wall Street hedge fund managers are demanding steadily rising earnings from Carrier’s parent, United Technologies, even as growth remains sluggish worldwide. The Carrier plant here is plenty profitable. But moving to Monterrey, where workers earn in a day what they make here in an hour, will increase profits faster. Mr. Roell, who earns about $55,000 a year with overtime as a team leader making furnaces, has few illusions about the gulf separating him from Mr. Trump, or the global headwinds that American factory workers face. “His father was a millionaire, he’s a billionaire,” Mr. Roell said, sitting at Sully’s Bar & Grill on Thursday night opposite the factory with fellow Carrier workers. “His son Barron’s allowance is probably more than my salary.” Nor does he underestimate the profound economic threat to the 1,400 workers at the factory, where layoffs are expected to begin next summer and continue in waves until it closes in 2019. Mr. Roell was promoted to team leader in March. The mood in the factory has worsened since. Senior engineers travel from Indianapolis to Monterrey to supervise the shifting of production lines to Carrier’s factory there, workers and union officials said. Mexican engineers, in turn, have been coming here, measuring and assessing the machines they will operate south of the border, unless, of course, Mr. Trump can deliver on his promise. “It’s demoralizing when you see them taking pictures,” Mr. Roell said. “It’s like you are getting divorced but you are still living with your wife and her new boyfriend is coming over.” A Drought of Good Jobs For workers like Mr. Roell, 36, who started at Carrier just weeks after receiving his high school diploma and never returned to school, the problem is not a shortage of jobs in the area. Instead, it is a drought of jobs that pay anywhere near the $23.83 an hour he makes at Carrier, let alone enough to give him a toehold in the middle class. When he drives to work each day before dawn, Mr. Roell passes warehouse after warehouse of giants like Walmart and Kohl’s with “Help Wanted” signs outside promising jobs within. The problem is that they typically pay $13 to $15 an hour. “I guess I could work two full-time shifts a day,” he joked. The situation confronting Mr. Roell and other blue-collar Carrier workers is not simply one anecdote from the region some people call the Rust Belt. It is part of a broad predicament for non-college-educated workers borne out by Census Bureau data. And it explains why even in Indiana, a state with a lower rate of unemployment than the national average, and a strong rebound from the recession in many ways, the economic and political frustration is palpable. Since 2010, the private sector in Indiana has added roughly 300,000 jobs, bringing the unemployment rate from a high of 10.9 percent in January 2010 (nearly a percentage point above the national average) to 4.5 percent now (nearly half a percentage point below the national unemployment rate). But nearly all that growth occurred in the service sector — hotel and food-service jobs, or health care technicians, or workers in the warehouses Mr. Roell drives past — which added more than 220,000 positions for a total of 1.9 million today. While manufacturers added 85,569 jobs since the sector bottomed out at 434,919 in January 2010, factory employment in Indiana over all remains significantly below where it was before the Great Recession. And service jobs do not come close to paying what manufacturing jobs do. According to the Census Bureau, the typical service sector position in Indiana paid $39,338 in 2015, compared with $59,029 for a manufacturing position. The cross-generational drop-off can be stark, and it scars families. Within Local 1999 of the United Steelworkers union, which includes workers at Carrier and other local industrial employers, members typically start at $17 an hour, according to Chuck Jones, Local 1999’s president. For comparison, his 21-year-old granddaughter Haley Duncan is about to finish college and take a job in health care that pays $14.50 an hour. Ms. Duncan and her older brother, Drake, were tempted by factory work. But Mr. Jones and their parents told them to forget it and stay in school because, while manufacturing might pay more, its future is becoming more precarious. The Rexnord bearing factory here — where Mr. Jones started working fresh out of high school in 1969 and where his stepson works now — last month said it might follow Carrier to Mexico and eliminate at least 300 jobs. Can Mr. Trump, with his promises to bring these jobs back and his calls to retaliate against chief executives if they do not listen, stem the tide? Broader economic trends suggest Mr. Trump will face an uphill struggle even if he does follow through on his threat to pressure Carrier’s executives or hit the company with steep tariffs. What is more, while the bully pulpit of the president is something corporate chieftains fear, Rexnord’s plan to pull up stakes even after the Carrier situation suggests businesses will not bow to the threat of bad P.R. And even if Congress and the White House agree on a plan to increase manufacturing, tax credits for research and new investments, for example, or financing apprenticeships as European countries do, automation will continue to claim jobs. “I’m pretty skeptical Trump’s policies will reverse this process,” said John Van Reenen, a professor of economics at M.I.T. who studies how technology and innovation affect profits and wages at companies. “These are fundamental forces that have more to do with technology than trade.” In particular, he said, across developed economies more national income is going to capital, that is, owners and shareholders, rather than labor. “We’ve seen this in many countries with different political systems,” he said. “It’s a winner-take-all world.” Even Robin Maynard, a Carrier team leader who enthusiastically backed Mr. Trump, acknowledges that even a phone call from the Oval Office to the company’s executive suite might not be enough to save his job. “Hopefully, he can do something for us,” Mr. Maynard said. “But I think it’s out of the C.E.O’s hands. It’s in the hands of the shareholders.” In this age of 401(k) investment plans and individual retirement accounts, these shareholders are, in a real sense, all of us. But for the Carrier workers in Indianapolis and millions of other blue-collar workers, no matter how they voted, nuances like that do not matter so much now. Just the hope that Mr. Trump will try to reverse the long decline in their neighborhoods, their living standards and even their longevity is an emotional balm. “He doesn’t like blacks. He doesn’t like Hispanics. He doesn’t like disabled people,” said Jennifer Shanklin-Hawkins, who, like roughly half the Carrier factory workers, is African-American. “He’s not presidential material. But my husband and I weren’t mad or upset when he won. I know blacks who voted for him, and I want to give him a chance.” Diversity and Distrust Some blue-collar neighborhoods that supported Mr. Trump have been portrayed as monocultures, the opposite of supposedly more diverse, cosmopolitan cities that favored Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic candidate. That caricature does not hold up here. At least half of the workers on Carrier’s assembly line are women. And dozens of Burmese immigrants have gone to work at the factory in recent years, part of an influx of nearly 15,000 refugees from Myanmar into Indianapolis since 2001. “It can be hard to communicate, but they work very hard,” Mr. Maynard said. “They don’t complain, and I love their work ethic.” And the neighborhoods around Carrier’s factory are considerably more diverse than many wealthy New York and San Francisco suburbs, where Democrats dominate. Down the road from the Carrier factory, past the railroad tracks and a few patches of farmland that remain in Indianapolis, the tidy neighborhood of split-level and ranch houses where Cecil Link Jr. lives has changed in recent years. A worker at a plastics factory nearby, Mr. Link noted that a Hispanic family recently moved in next door, and he said he was pleased that blacks and whites now socialize in ways almost unimaginable decades ago. “It pains me to see this country divided by race,” Mr. Link said. Nevertheless, he voted for Mr. Trump. The last time he voted in a presidential election was 1992, when he cast his ballot for Bill Clinton. But this time, he said, he registered explicitly to vote for Mr. Trump. “I was tired of corruption and lies in Washington,” he said. “I just wanted a nonpolitician like Trump.” Mr. Presley, the 59-year-old white Crawfordsville steelworker who voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 and Mr. Trump in 2016, was even more emphatic that racial resentment or ethnic bigotry was not behind his support for Mr. Trump. “I grew up on the West Side of Indianapolis in a racist environment,” he said. “But I went to a high school that was 57 percent black, and I played football with a lot of black guys and we became close friends. I learned not to be racist.” Instead of bias, what animates these voters, whatever their race or political orientation, is a profound distrust and resentment of wealthier, educated Americans, a group they say lacks a connection to them and does not care about their economic situation. And to them, Mrs. Clinton seemed at least as elite as Mr. Trump, if not more so. “I just couldn’t bring myself to vote for him, but both candidates are evil,” said Ms. Shanklin-Hawkins, who reluctantly voted for Mrs. Clinton, but has never forgiven her for her remarks about “superpredators” in the 1990s, or the mandatory prison sentencing guidelines Mr. Clinton signed into law as president. “Hillary hasn’t sweated a day in her life, unless it was losing a tough case as a lawyer,” Mr. Maynard said. “We wanted to take America in a different direction. I’m just hoping Trump will do what he says.” Can the Democratic Party recapture these voters if Mr. Trump does not deliver? Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, among the most liberal Democrats in the Senate, contends it can, if Democrats follow his lead in appealing to working-class concerns and opposing free trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement and the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, a pact with Asian nations that President Obama supported. Of course these, too, are Mr. Trump’s positions. Mr. Presley readily acknowledges that Mr. Trump is a billionaire with an Ivy League education. “But he gets that the country is in bad shape.” Mr. Presley said. “Sure, he made some mistakes and sometimes he went a little overboard, but the guys I work with related to it. If we spoke in public, we’d make mistakes too.” To them, it’s not only the country that’s in bad shape. So are the institutions that once provided structure to working-class life in America. Many Carrier workers are regular churchgoers, but Ms. Hargrove said she was deeply troubled by how priests abused children, or how the police shot suspects even though their arms were raised in the air. “Things are chaotic,” she said. The distrust is evident even within the Steelworkers union, another institution that once provided a support system for workers. Mr. Roell is leery of area leaders like Mr. Jones of Local 1999, who had battles of his own with the union’s top officials over their support for Mrs. Clinton. A fierce supporter of Bernie Sanders, Mrs. Clinton’s rival for the Democratic nomination, Mr. Jones and Local 1999 did not make an endorsement in the general election. “I held my nose and voted for her,” he said between drags on a Marlboro at the local’s union hall. “I didn’t trust her a bit. I told people she would flip on trade deals after she was elected.” “I’m as left-wing as you can find, and I thought Trump was full of it,” he said. “But everybody is tired of the same old politicians. It could have been Captain Kangaroo and he might have won.” As for the candidate who did win, Mr. Trump, the union leader said he was waiting for him to make that phone call to Carrier. “He’s got time. He doesn’t take the oath of office until Jan. 20,” Mr. Jones said. “Trump made Carrier the poster child and said he would hold Carrier accountable. Well, we’re going to hold him to it.” Go to MSN Home More in Money Amazing Airstreams: The coolest tiny homes on wheels Lovemoney 8 ways President Trump will affect Wall Street U.S. News & World Report - Money 6 reasons to think twice before moving to Canada MarketWatch The 10 most expensive prescription drugs in America Fiscal Times How China's richest man is buying up the world Lovemoney 7 things you should never do online USA TODAY Up Next 20 tips for saving money at the grocery store U.S. News & World Report - Money AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More from The New York Times What’s on TV Wednesday: ‘Undercover’ and ‘Polar Bear Town’ The New York Times Dave Roberts and Terry Francona Named Managers of the Year The New York Times A Richter, Owned by Clapton, Fetches $22 Million at Christie’s The New York Times Truffles in Paradise.

Don't Miss: Hatchimals Deals on Amazon.com The doctors took pieces of rib cartilage, carved them into the shape of an ear and inserted it on one of the arms of the patient. The ear will be removed from the arm and attached to the patient’s head once fully grown. The patient, only identified as Ji, has lost his right ear in a car accident a year ago. Ji sustained serious injuries in the right side of his face including losing his ear and had to undergo numerous surgical operations to restore his facial skin and cheeks. But patient Ji, who is in his 30s, was frustrated about his torn off ear and wants to get it back.  Guo Shuzhong, an expert in reconstructive surgery, devised a three-step surgical plan for the patient.  Artificial ear grown on patient's arm to replace ear lost in traffic accident in China's Xi'an pic.twitter.com/RLaNcXxExm— CCTVNEWS (@cctvnews) November 9, 2016 In the first phase, doctors inserted a skin expander in the patient’s right arm and regularly injected water to expand the skin. In the second phase, which was successfully done on Tuesday, doctors took pieces of cartilage from the patient’s chest and buried them under the expanded skin. The third phase will be transplanting new ear onto patient’s head, which may take three to four months before the organ is fully grown, China Daily reports. Doctor Guo Shuzhong also carried out the first facial transplant operation in China in 2006 when a disfigured man was given a new cheek, upper lip, nose and an eyebrow. Guo reveal that the most difficult part of the latest surgery was the carving as ear has dozens of anatomical structures and is considered to be a complicated component of our body. The reconstructive surgery was performed at the affiliated hospital of Xi’an Jiaotong University in Xi'an, Shaanxi province.
