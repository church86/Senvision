Wal-Mart's plan is to be totally removed from the grid, powered only by renewable energy sources and lithium batteries, by 2020. Ambitious as it may sound, it's been a boon to an industry falling into a lull.  Ever since the extension of the investment tax credit (ITC) late last year, investments in solar companies have slipped. The market expected to see a sudden increase in new solar installations in the rush for installers to get the biggest credit. Instead, the country’s solar installers... took a break. Without the sudden pressure to get new projects underway, companies and individual buyers alike have relaxed, causing solar capacity growth to do the same. But don’t think that means you should ignore solar stocks. In fact, this may just be the best time to buy in... Market Restart Wal-Mart, for all its boasting, isn’t the only company building a renewable base. In fact, it’s not even the biggest! The Solar Energy Industries Association’s biggest corporate solar installer lineup currently reads like this: Target (147 megawatts) Wal-Mart (140 megawatts) Prologis (107.8 megawatts) Apple (93.9 megawatts) Costco (50.7 megawatts) Other big solar installers include Kohl’s, Ikea, and Macy’s. Each has a goal of being mostly, if not completely, powered by clean energy within the next few years. These large-scale installations are becoming a larger part of solar's growth this year, even as that growth slows. Without the hype to keep them up, solar stocks are slowing as well. But given the long-term outlook on the technology, that may just be giving savvy investors a chance to grab up the best stocks at a bargain. GTM Research expects that solar capacity will increase steadily through 2020, though recent research suggests there will be a lull through 2017. Investors shouldn’t worry about a single year’s worth of slow growth, however — not in an industry that’s had such steady increases since its inception and is expected to continue expanding for the foreseeable future. The Energy Information Administration estimates that solar will account for about 1% of all U.S. energy by next year, up from 0.6% in 2015. That may not seem like a lot, but it’s just the beginning. The whole world is working to move away from fossil fuels now, which means the market for renewables has been busted wide open. And just because we haven’t yet seen the surge in installations that many expected doesn’t mean it won’t happen at all. The ITC offers a 30% tax credit on all solar installations under construction by the end of this year. That number drops to just 26% after 2019, 10% after 2021, and cuts out completely in 2023. New projects still have a little bit of leeway in getting those credits, and the rush may come at the last minute. To get complete articles and information, join our newsletter for FREE!

Foresight on how the future of energy will unfold. Additional Storage Anyone looking to be 100% solar anytime soon is also going to need some battery power to back it all up. Energy storage and renewable technologies go hand in hand, if only because there still needs to be electricity running when the sun goes down. Large-scale energy storage especially will see some growth in coming years as energy grids all over the world integrate more solar and other renewables. The biggest growth in these large-scale systems is yet to come! Now, by the time that happens, I expect we’ll have much better solar panels as well. We’ll have to, in fact! Right now, the best designs only function at about 28% efficiency, not nearly enough to make up for all the fossil fuel power the world wants to retire. Renewable energies are struggling to find the balance between efficiency and price. For obvious reasons, higher-efficiency solar panels cost more, which makes widespread adoption a challenge. But the price is dropping as capacity is growing, helped along by projects like Wal-Mart’s. The more low-cost installations are adopted, the easier it will be to integrate the technology everywhere else. Investment Interest I wouldn’t blame you for hesitating to buy into solar right now. The recent history of the biggest installer in the country, SolarCity, reads more like a cautionary tale than a success story. But even the skeptics are only seeing a slowdown through 2017. Beyond that, business will pick up again, and probably even reach new highs as the final deadline for the ITC comes into play! Without a doubt, this is far from the death of the solar industry.

Tom Jewell/Special to cleveland.com  SOLON, Ohio -- Backers of the Fountains of Solon rezoning initiative have now taken a different tack on selling their plan to voters. Sent out last week in what could be the final mailing before the Nov. 8 election, potential developers of the proposed upscale apartment complex urged residents to vote "yes" on Issue 98 to stop Walmart from coming to Solon. "Hypothetically, it could go in there," Fountains of Solon spokeswoman Jori Mintz said of the retail giant and the city's current "C-3" commercial zoning designation. At least one Fountains opponent accused the property owners of resorting to "fear tactics" to scare voters before they head to the polls next Tuesday, while a resident of Ward Four -- where the land sits --believes the campaign is getting "desperate." Mintz noted that Walmart closed its "Supercenter" in neighboring Bedford early this year -- the only one in Ohio -- as part of a "global restructuring" that shuttered 154 stores. "Those people need a place to shop now," Mintz said. Opponents countered that the Solon parcel is still considered too small by current Walmart standards, and pointed to the fully-operational store on the other side of the city limits in Bainbridge Township. "They're not going to build a new store a mile-and-a-half away from that one," said Mark Haas, treasurer of the group Citizens Against Rezoning Solon (CARS), who lives less than 1,000 feet down Solon Road. In addition to Walmart, the campaign literature mentions dollar stores, check-cashing enterprises, and fast food outlets as possible uses on the 22 acres of land off of Solon Road and Erico Drive. "These uses are approved by Solon, but they are not right for Ward Four," rezoning petition organizers said. "You have the power to stop Walmart by voting 'yes' on Issue 98." What developer Nathan Lancry and his team of investors want is "R-3" Multi-Family Residential zoning to allow them to build "high-end luxury lifestyle apartments" on the land, renting individually for $1,500 to $2,000 a month. Compared to the theoretical scenarios put forth, Mintz said that  "a relatively small, modest 186-unit building would be a much better neighbor." Opponents have questioned all along whether the zoning change would lead to such an apartment complex, or open the door for speculative uses. Lancry has given his assurances that the Fountains of Solon would proceed -- at a projected cost of $20 to $30 million -- once the rezoning is approved by voters. City officials have pointed out that no development agreement has been reached with Fountains of Solon. Lancry said he offered a development agreement at the outset, but was told it would not be necessary, at least when he introduced the proposal in early 2014. That was before he and Jay Buick GMC President Marc Jacobson actually bought the property from University Hospitals later that year for $2.35 million.  "Nathan will not build any of these," Mintz said, referring to the hypothetical possibilities of Walmart, payday lending, fast food or dollar stores. "But he will certainly have to consider selling the land if the zoning change doesn't pass," Mintz added. Another vocal opponent of the Fountains of Solon rezoning proposal has been Jacki Calavitta, who said she was "totally flabbergasted" after getting a "Stop Walmart" campaign flier in the mail on Monday. "These people will stop at nothing to trick voters into approving their rezoning," Calavitta said. "They must figure that their unrealistic sales pitch hasn't convinced enough people, so now it's 'hey, let's try the fear tactic.'" Calavitta believes "the idea that any of these types of commercial businesses are just dying to get their hands on that piece of property is ludicrous." Haas agreed, saying that he feels the Fountains of Solon backers have gotten desperate. "They can't convince people that their bad idea is a good idea, so now they're trying to intimidate them," Haas said. Neither Haas nor Calavitta can see a luxury apartment complex succeeding in that location. "But there are generous financial incentives through the federal government for public housing, particularly in 'affluent' areas," Calavitta said. "And if multi-family rezoning is approved, there would be nothing to stop it." Haas said there would be nothing to stop the owners from selling the land after it was rezoned. Although the land is zoned commercial, the City Planning Department has recommended office space, something that the previous owner, University Hospitals, was not happy with back in 2010 when such revisions to the city's Master Plan were discussed. City Planning Director Rob Frankland said at the time there was "no rationale to the current zoning in that area," citing an "unusual pattern" beginning with low-intensity office space on the corner of Solon and SOM Center roads. Frankland also noted in 2010 that a Master Plan is supposed to reflect "ideal zoning" for a city, but remains only a blueprint, and that conceivably, "we could end up with a hostile attempt to implement full commercial zoning." City Law Director Tom Lobe reminded council earlier this month that under the "home ward veto" zoning provision in the City Charter, Issue 98 has to be approved by the majority of voters both citywide and in Ward Four. "If one or the other fails, it does not pass," Lobe said.

Featured Local News Business Entertainment Lifestyle Politics Press Releases Sci & Health Sports Technology Tuesday, November 15, 2016, 12:37 PM ,  You are here:Home Local News Amazon’s Black Friday Deals Begin Today 0 Amazon’s Black Friday Deals Begin Today Published on November 1, 2016 Amazon started its Black Friday Deals store on Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2016, which will run through Dec. 22. It’s only one day after Halloween and more than three weeks to Thanksgiving but Black Friday deals are already here.  Amazon began offering sales on Tuesday as part of its Black Friday Deals store, which will run through Dec. 22. Each day will bring a set of timed sales with new deals coming “as often as every five minutes,” similar to last years.  Meanwhile, Walmart and Target are taking cues from each other by offering more exclusive merchandise during the holiday season. Walmart is offering 400 exclusive toy items including what is already a hit — a Disney Princess Carriage priced at $398. It’s also adding thousands more items that will be available for store pickup.  Target is offering 1,800 new or exclusive toys, about 15 percent more than last year. Another exclusive is a 10-disc box set from Garth Brooks, which includes his new album and the 25th anniversary edition of “Friends in Low Places.” The set will be in Target stores Nov. 11, two weeks before the new album is available elsewhere. Walmart is also planning more product demonstrations, in departments from toys to food. And Santas who used to remain stationary will roam the stores for more customer interaction and selfies. For the end of the year, the world’s largest retailer plans to deploy “holiday helpers” stationed at the checkouts, who can direct customers to registers with shorter lines or even run back to the aisles to pick up an item someone forgot. Macy’s announced in October it was staying committed to Thanksgiving Day shopping, saying it’ll open an hour earlier this year. The move dampened hopes that other key stores will back away from the “Christmas Creep.” The retailer plans to open at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving, with most Macy’s stores closing at 2 a.m., and then reopening at 6 a.m. on Black Friday. It cited “ongoing customer interest in shopping on Thanksgiving, both at Macy’s and at many other retailers.” Macy’s announcement shows that many major chains will probably stick with the Thanksgiving opening and may even open earlier than last year as they try to avoid being trumped by the competition. Macy’s is under pressure to do well, after six straight quarters of declines for a key revenue measure. Target, Best Buy and J.C. Penney have not yet announced their Thanksgiving strategy.

It's only one day after Halloween and more than three weeks to Thanksgiving but Black Friday deals are already here.  Amazon began offering sales on Tuesday as part of its Black Friday Deals store, which will run through Dec. 22. Smoked Pot? No College? The Police Still Might Hire You Each day will bring a set of timed sales with new deals coming "as often as every five minutes," similar to last years.  Meanwhile, Walmart and Target are taking cues from each other by offering more exclusive merchandise during the holiday season. Top News Photos: Orangutan Conservation, Mosul and More Getty Images Walmart is offering 400 exclusive toy items including what is already a hit — a Disney Princess Carriage priced at $398. It's also adding thousands more items that will be available for store pickup.  Target is offering 1,800 new or exclusive toys, about 15 percent more than last year. Another exclusive is a 10-disc box set from Garth Brooks, which includes his new album and the 25th anniversary edition of "Friends in Low Places." The set will be in Target stores Nov. 11, two weeks before the new album is available elsewhere. Columbia Stops Wrestling Team From Competing Over Lewd Texts Walmart is also planning more product demonstrations, in departments from toys to food. And Santas who used to remain stationary will roam the stores for more customer interaction and selfies. For the end of the year, the world's largest retailer plans to deploy "holiday helpers" stationed at the checkouts, who can direct customers to registers with shorter lines or even run back to the aisles to pick up an item someone forgot. Los Angeles Bid to Address Trump Election at Olympic Meeting Macy's announced in October it was staying committed to Thanksgiving Day shopping, saying it'll open an hour earlier this year. The move dampened hopes that other key stores will back away from the "Christmas Creep." The retailer plans to open at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving, with most Macy's stores closing at 2 a.m., and then reopening at 6 a.m. on Black Friday. It cited "ongoing customer interest in shopping on Thanksgiving, both at Macy's and at many other retailers." NYC Woman Sues Zara, Says Dead Rat Was Sewn Into Dress Macy's announcement shows that many major chains will probably stick with the Thanksgiving opening and may even open earlier than last year as they try to avoid being trumped by the competition. Macy's is under pressure to do well, after six straight quarters of declines for a key revenue measure. Target, Best Buy and J.C. Penney have not yet announced their Thanksgiving strategy.

Manndrell D. Fuller  Circuit Judge Robert L. Kaczmarek on Monday, Oct. 31, sentenced Manndrell D. Fuller for six felonies. Kaczmarek sentenced Fuller to the mandatory, consecutive five years in prison for possessing a firearm during the commission of a felony-second offense and one year in jail for receiving and concealing stolen ammunition and other felonies. Men take pleas in theft of rifle ammo at Walmart Fuller, 23, pleaded no contest as charged in September for an Oct. 29, 2015, incident at the Walmart on Brockway in Saginaw Township. He pleaded to the stolen ammunition charge, single counts of possessing a firearm as a felon and possessing ammunition as a felon, and three felony firearm counts Because he was on parole at the time of the incident, Fuller did not receive any credit for time served. He was on parole for assault with intent to commit great bodily harm, which he committed by opening fire on an East Side Saginaw house in March 2011. Fuller entered his plea on the day he was scheduled to go to trial along with his co-defendants, Shauna S. Washington and Tyrus L. Williams, who faced the stolen ammunition charge and a single first-offense felony firearm charge. Testimony: Man charged with theft of assault rifle ammo at Walmart told security to 'look the other way' After observing a vehicle matching the description of one involved in the theft of ammunition from the Walmart, Saginaw police performed a traffic stop on the vehicle, according to testimony from the defendants' preliminary hearing. Officer Matthew Carpus testified he observed an SKS-style rifle and SKS-style magazine on the floor boards of the back seat. Officer Isaac Babinski said the magazine was "high capacity," which he defined as a rifle magazine that accepts more than 10 rounds. Carpus testified that after he was alerted by another officer, he observed a box in the area of the front-seat passenger. Inside the box was a box of 9mm Winchester ammunition and multiple 7.62 ammunition in a plastic shopping bag. The 7.62 ammunition also was Winchester, police said. Williams pleaded guilty to the stolen ammunition charge on the same day Fuller entered his plea and likely will receive a probation sentence. Washington on Oct. 3 accepted the same plea agreement and also will likely receive a probation sentence. Williams, 22, and Washington, 24, both remain free. Kaczmarek is scheduled to sentence them on Nov. 7.

An off-duty Nolensville police officer was working security at the Walmart. He was patrolling the parking lot just before 3:30 a.m. when he saw the robbery. Detectives said the man was asleep in his truck when the suspects opened the door, demanded money and started going through his things. Detectives said one of the men was wearing camouflage and had a machete. The suspects now identified as Aaron Maddux, Darry Wilson and Jeffrey Fuqua, reportedly took $20 from the victim and his cell phone. The off-duty Nolensville Officer held two of the suspects until Metro police arrived. The third man fled the scene. A Metro officer found him walking down the road shortly after. All three men are charged with aggravated robbery. Wilson is also charged with possession of drug paraphernalia.

(Photo: Saul Loeb, AFP/Getty Images) Walmart has removed books featuring photos of child nudity from its website. The explicit photography books by Jock Sturges were not sold in Walmart stores but were available at Walmart.com. Last week, the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, an anti-pornography organization, launched a petition to remove those and other books and magazines the group says are offensive. “The books were in violation of our prohibited items policy and were removed as soon as they were brought to our attention,’’ Walmart said in a statement Monday. “We’re refining our policies and filters to better flag and block these types of items in the future.” Sturges has produced books featuring art photos of nude adolescents for decades. In 1990, The New York Times reported, the FBI raided his studio and confiscated his cameras, but a grand jury declined to indict him. He continued to work. A variety of his art books are on sale on Amazon's website. Dawn Hawkins, NCOSE’s executive director, applauded the change. “This is a major victory in our fight for a world free from sexual exploitation,’’ she said in a statement. The group says it is also seeking an end to the retailer selling Cosmopolitan magazine, which is says features sexually suggestive content that can be easily viewed by children shopping with their parents, and primers for the sex trafficking of women that NCOSE says are still sold online. "We are continuing communications with Walmart executives,'' Hawkins says, "and we hope Walmart will take further, swift action to ensure it stays true to its family-friendly brand by removing all other sexually exploitive materials," . 302 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 13 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2f6n4KX

Walmart pulls nude photo books from website USA TODAY 11/1/2016 Charisse Jones © Scott Olson/Getty Images   Walmart has removed books featuring child nudity from its website, the retailer said Monday. Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 70.88 +0.39 +0.55% New York Times Co NYT ▼ 12.13 -0.33 -2.61% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 739.92 +20.85 +2.90% The explicit photography books by Jock Sturges were not sold in Walmart stores, but were available at Walmart.com. Last week, the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, an anti-pornography organization, launched a petition to remove those and other books and magazines the group says are offensive. “The books were in violation of our prohibited items policy and were removed as soon as they were brought to our attention,’’ Walmart said in a statement. “We’re refining our policies and filters to better flag and block these types of items in the future.” Sturges has produced books featuring art photos of nude adolescents for decades. In 1990, the New York Times reported, the FBI raided his studio and confiscated his cameras, but a grand jury declined to indict him. He continued to work. A variety of his art books are on sale on Amazon's website. Dawn Hawkins, NCOSE’s executive director, applauded the change.  “This is a major victory in our fight for a world free from sexual exploitation,’’ she said in a statement. The group says it is also seeking an end to the retailer selling Cosmopolitan magazine, which is says features sexually suggestive content that can be easily viewed by children shopping with their parents, and primers for the sex trafficking of women that NCOSE says are still sold online. "We are continuing communications with Walmart executives,'' Hawkins says, "and we hope Walmart will take further, swift action to ensure it stays true to its family-friendly brand by removing all other sexually exploitive materials,"  .  Go to MSN Home More in Money Amazing Airstreams: The coolest tiny homes on wheels Lovemoney 8 ways President Trump will affect Wall Street U.S. News & World Report - Money 6 reasons to think twice before moving to Canada MarketWatch The 10 most expensive prescription drugs in America Fiscal Times How China's richest man is buying up the world Lovemoney 7 things you should never do online USA TODAY Up Next 20 tips for saving money at the grocery store U.S. News & World Report - Money AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More From USA TODAY Ex-Northwestern player sues NCAA, school USA TODAY Jaguar wows with electric I-Pace SUV concept USA TODAY Get to know Tinder's new terms USA TODAY Five students stabbed at Utah high school USA TODAY USA TODAY View the full site Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

(WMT) Need a Christmas Boost By Scutify Oct 31, 2016 11:33 am PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. WMT and TGT stock need a little Christmas right now against Amazon "We need a little Christmas, right this very minute. Candles in the window. Carols at the spinet." The Jerry Herman song We Need a Little Christmas, from Mame, which debuted 50 years ago, reflects the prayers of retailers like Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE:WMT). Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified) "Christmas creep" means most stores will have their Christmas decorations up as soon as they take down the Halloween masks. In the online world of TGT, WMT and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), those decorations are already up. Free shipping, mobile-first sites and online video ads are now just an ante in this high-stakes game, as e-commerce sales are expected to grow 13% and mobile alone up to 60%, to over $12.5 billion. Retail stocks like TGT stock and Walmart stock that want a leg-up on AMZN are doing just that - seeking any possible advantage. These big merchants can also gain one with exclusive merchandise, things Amazon won't have, like giant pink princess cars and virtual reality drones. It's all a little bit desperate. The WMT Strategy Walmart has a reason to be desperate. The growth of Amazon has cut its total share of the retail market to 10% from 11.6% in 2009, as online now represents 10% of the total retail market. WMT's online sales grew 12% last year to $13.7 billion, and it's now the second-largest e-tailer, but Amazon sales grew 20% in the same period. What Stocks Will Win the 2016 Election? Merely offering free pick-up of online orders wasn't getting the job done. The pick-up process remains more difficult at Walmart than AMZN, just as I found out last year when I needed an in-car audio solution. It's unimaginable that this would work on the day after Thanksgiving. So WMT has bought Jet.Com for $3 billion to bolster its e-commerce operations and is launching a price war. Jet became interesting to Walmart because it made online shopping fun, offering savings with debit cards and a shopper's willingness to opt-out of free returns. Some analysts are skeptical of the purchase, but WMT thinks that Jet's "dynamic pricing" module, which rewards bigger orders with bigger discounts, is perfect for Christmas shopping. The Target Strategy Target had a great e-commerce Christmas last year, with sales growing 34% and a successful integration of online ordering and in-store pickups. Industry watchers gave its effort strong reviews, alongside Amazon and Wayfair Inc (NYSE:W), which is another e-commerce unicorn that could also be sold by next Christmas. But the success came at the cost of margins for TGT stock, and the company's 2016 strategy is, well, more targeted. TGT is emphasizing value over mere price this year, and already offering free shipping on Christmas orders. Target is ramping up its e-commerce budget to $2 billion, poaching executives from Amazon and other successful e-tailers and working to improve online cash registers, so they don't "freeze" at the crucial moment. Exclusives are also a big part of the plan for bringing in TGT shoppers. Last year, Target featured an exclusive edition of the Adele's album 25. This year it's a boxed set of Garth Brooks' work and a new line of children's clothes called Cat & Jack, launched last summer under the Brooklyn Bridge. Next Page The key buzzword for TGT stock last year was "omnichannel," making the process of buying online, or in the store, as seamless and painless as possible. But the key to TGT stock this year will be differentiation, making the online channel do what it's best at - quick ordering and fulfillment - while having the stores do what they do best - promotions and serendipity. Can This Work for TGT Stock? The online and offline shopping worlds are coming together. Amazon is opening stores, WMT is offering deals, TGT is offering focus, and that's going to continue. Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Is Going to Disrupt Retail Again For the brick-and-mortar giants like Target stock and Walmart stock, this is an expensive, unprofitable slog, trying to replicate infrastructure and systems Amazon has already built and profits from. But they feel the pain is necessary if they're to remain relevant in Christmases to come. Just remember, when you look at the results, that e-commerce sales for the big merchants aren't necessarily incremental gains. That's why I'm still long AMZN and don't currently have a position in either TGT stock or Walmart stock.

Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Donald Trump touts that as president he would be good for American workers. Although many of his plans are vague or possibly harmful, there is one clear outcome of a Trump presidency: with the power to appoint Supreme Court justices, Trump promises to continue a conservative majority. We usually think of the Supreme Court in terms of what it means for abortion rights, marriage equality and the Second Amendment. At the third presidential debate, that’s what we heard. Trump vowed to appoint justices in the mold of the late Antonin Scalia who would be hostile to Roe v. Wade and bolster gun rights. Hillary Clinton said her nominees would support women’s rights, marriage equality and reverse Citizens United. The candidates did not, however, address the Supreme Court’s substantial impact on the workplace – an impact that’s often ignored amid these hot-button issues. Almost five decades of a conservative Court majority have sharply limited the rights of workers to unionize, form class actions and fight discrimination. The results have been profound and help explain the deterioration of the working class and the rise of economic inequality in recent decades. The court is now in a 4-4 split between liberal and conservative justices. The Senate’s refusal to confirm President Barack Obama’s nominee to replace Scalia means it’s likely the next occupant of the Oval Office will get to pick who fills that seat – and possibly several more. That will determine the kind of court Americans have for years or even decades to come. Conservative appointments by a President Trump would likely continue the decimation of workplace justice, particularly collective efforts to improve working conditions and pay. As I have documented, a look back at some of the court’s recent rulings shows how. The body of Justice Antonin Scalia arrives at the Supreme Court in February. Alex Brandon/AP Killing off the class action Take the case of Wal-Mart v. Dukes. In 2001, past and present female workers of Wal-Mart sued the company for paying and promoting them less than their male counterparts. The workers joined together to file a class action – a legal procedure that makes it possible for relatively small claims to be aggregated so that plaintiffs can afford to bring a case. They are also far more efficient for our judicial system than hearing scores of similar claims separately. Yet in 2011, Justice Scalia wrote the opinion for a 5-4 majority that Wal-Mart was essentially too big to sue. Scalia said the plaintiff’s claims lacked a common basis and scoffed at the notion that Wal-Mart’s discretionary pay and promotion system could result in company-wide discrimination. In dissent, Justice Ruth Ginsburg countered that discrimination is most likely to flourish in discretionary systems like Wal-mart’s due to stereotyped assumptions that managers make about female employees, even unconsciously. As a result of the ruling, the effectiveness of the class action tool in employment cases has been reduced. Then, in 2016, the court – without Justice Scalia – declined to expand Wal-Mart v. Dukes (in a 6-2 vote) by resisting an employer’s bid to disallow statistical evidence in all class actions. In that case, employees at a Tyson pork processing plant used statistics to establish the amount of time they were not paid for taking on and off their protective gear. Statistical sampling was necessary because Tyson failed to keep accurate time records. The analysis showed that employees spent an average of 18 to about 21 minutes on this task, depending on their job duties. This additional time made some employees eligible for overtime pay. As a result of the case, the use of statistics in class action cases will continue to be hotly litigated. Eroding the right to organize In the past, one of the key ways workers have improved their pay and working conditions is by forming a union. Indeed, collective bargaining is associated with a wage premium of 13.6 percent, compared with workers who aren’t covered by such an agreement. Conversely, the ongoing decline in union membership is a key factor in growing economic inequality, depressing wages of union and non-union members alike. The Supreme Court has helped accelerate that decline. In 2014, the court struck down a 2003 law granting home health care workers in Illinois who are paid by Medicaid the right to collectively bargain for better wages and working conditions. Justice Samuel Alito concluded for the 5-4 majority that the First Amendment prohibited the state from requiring these workers to pay union dues. In so doing, he circumvented years of precedent upholding union dues for public employees as necessary to prevent free-riding by non-members and to give the state a single entity for negotiating purposes. In dissent, Justice Elena Kagan described the labor instability that would result from the court’s ruling. She also noted evidence that collective bargaining helped the workers double their wages, obtain health insurance and receive better training and enhanced workplace safety. Those benefits could vanish without collective bargaining, harming not only the workers but also the elderly and disabled people for whom they care. Scalia’s sudden death in February ended up giving unions a reprieve in another important case involving the constitutionality of requiring public workers to pay their fair share of union dues, even if they aren’t a member. That case, Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, was heard in January, with a skeptical Scalia in attendance, but in March the Court issued a 4-4 decision that left a lower court’s decision upholding such fees intact. Split decisions mean whatever ruling immediately preceded the hearing before the Supreme Court stands but doesn’t create a precedent. This issue will arise again, and, obviously, the next justice will tilt the balance. Health care and religious belief Health care is another area where a slim conservative majority has rolled back worker protections. In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., Hobby Lobby and other privately held employers objected on religious grounds to paying for certain forms of legally mandated contraceptive coverage for millions of employees and their dependents. The court in 2014 upheld the employers’ religious claims in a 5-4 ruling. In so doing, the court privileged the religious beliefs of business owners against the health care needs of employees. The decision overturned part of the Affordable Care Act – a law passed through our democratic process with an express purpose of expanding preventative care for women and reducing gender inequities in the cost of care. The connection between access to contraception and the economic success of women is clear cut. To succeed in education and in the workplace, women need the ability to control the timing and size of their families. The Hobby Lobby ruling expresses a robust view of equality for corporations but none for women. It might spread to other areas as well. As Justice Ginsburg asked: “Suppose an employer’s sincerely held religious belief is offended by health coverage of vaccines, or paying the minimum wage, or according women equal pay for substantially similar work?” The Obama Administration approved accommodations for religious employers to avoid paying for employees’ contraceptive coverage directly. All they had to do was fill out a form, and, under the accommodation, insurers would pay for it instead. Some non-profit religious employers objected to even that and took their claim to the Supreme Court earlier this year. Apparently at an impasse and without a ninth justice, the court sent the government and the religious employers back to the drawing board to find a solution. Thus, it remains unresolved – for now – whether the Obama Administration’s accommodation on birth control coverage is lawful. And once again, who fills Scalia’s seat will likely determine whether such coverage remains a part of Obamacare for employees of religious employers. President Barack Obama’s choice to replace Scalia, Judge Merrick Garland (right), still hasn’t gotten a hearing in the Senate. Jose Luis Magana/AP The Supreme Court matters These are just a few of the more significant cases of recent years in which a slim conservative majority has rolled back worker rights. It’s likely that these issues will continue to be fought in the courts and find their way to the Supreme Court, along with many others. Simply put, a Trump-appointed Justice is far more likely, in my view, to rule against workers than a Clinton nominee. Whatever impact his other policies would have on the working class, it is clear his appointments for the highest court in the land would hurt workers and make it that much harder for them to join together to fight for their rights.

She also noted evidence that collective bargaining helped the workers double their wages, obtain health insurance and receive better training and enhanced workplace safety. Those benefits could vanish without collective bargaining, harming not only the workers but also the elderly and disabled people for whom they care. Scalia’s sudden death in February ended up giving unions a reprieve in another important case involving the constitutionality of requiring public workers to pay their fair share of union dues, even if they aren’t a member. That case, Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, was heard in January, with a skeptical Scalia in attendance, but in March the Court issued a 4-4 decision that left a lower court’s decision upholding such fees intact. Split decisions mean whatever ruling immediately preceded the hearing before the Supreme Court stands but doesn’t create a precedent. This issue will arise again, and, obviously, the next justice will tilt the balance. Health care is another area where a slim conservative majority has rolled back worker protections. In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., Hobby Lobby and other privately held employers objected on religious grounds to paying for certain forms of legally mandated contraceptive coverage for millions of employees and their dependents. The court in 2014 upheld the employers’ religious claims in a 5-4 ruling. In so doing, the court privileged the religious beliefs of business owners against the health care needs of employees. The decision overturned part of the Affordable Care Act – a law passed through our democratic process with an express purpose of expanding preventative care for women and reducing gender inequities in the cost of care. The connection between access to contraception and the economic success of women is clear cut. To succeed in education and in the workplace, women need the ability to control the timing and size of their families. The Hobby Lobby ruling expresses a robust view of equality for corporations but none for women. It might spread to other areas as well. As Justice Ginsburg asked: “Suppose an employer’s sincerely held religious belief is offended by health coverage of vaccines, or paying the minimum wage, or according women equal pay for substantially similar work?” The Obama Administration approved accommodations for religious employers to avoid paying for employees’ contraceptive coverage directly. All they had to do was fill out a form, and, under the accommodation, insurers would pay for it instead. Some non-profit religious employers objected to even that and took their claim to the Supreme Court earlier this year. Apparently at an impasse and without a ninth justice, the court sent the government and the religious employers back to the drawing board to find a solution. Thus, it remains unresolved – for now – whether the Obama Administration’s accommodation on birth control coverage is lawful. And once again, who fills Scalia’s seat will likely determine whether such coverage remains a part of Obamacare for employees of religious employers. These are just a few of the more significant cases of recent years in which a slim conservative majority has rolled back worker rights. It’s likely that these issues will continue to be fought in the courts and find their way to the Supreme Court, along with many others. Simply put, a Trump-appointed Justice is far more likely, in my view, to rule against workers than a Clinton nominee. Whatever impact his other policies would have on the working class, it is clear his appointments for the highest court in the land would hurt workers and make it that much harder for them to join together to fight for their rights.

Search Search for: About Us Toggle navigation Data Science Engineering Innovation Mobile Tech Culture Events About Us Social Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Topics Data Science Engineering Innovation Mobile Tech Culture Events Walmart Will Manage 200-Plus Distribution Centers With OneOps, Jenkins, Nexus and Kubernetes By: Patrick Dolan and Suyog Barve October 26, 2016 One of the key competitive advantages of Walmart Logistics over the decades has been keeping its distribution centers running as efficiently and autonomously as possible.  That autonomy extends to the very hardware and software infrastructure running within these facilities — more than 200 worldwide — as each location contains what could be viewed as a mini-datacenter. Managing this vast distributed landscape is a complicated logistics problem, presenting substantial challenges for everything from minor upgrades to the delivery of new software and solutions. To meet these challenges, Walmart Technology is undertaking an effort to enable cloud-like flexibility across its distribution centers. The initiative’s top-level goals include abstracting applications from their underlying infrastructure, delivering the ability to rapidly deploy new business solutions, and providing seamless, on-demand scaling based on application workloads. Each business application should function autonomously, like the distribution centers themselves. But bringing a cloud-like environment to a disparate network of on-premises logistics systems is no easy challenge. To meet these goals, Walmart Technology is bringing together a handful of individually impressive open source software components: OneOps, Kubernetes, Jenkins and Nexus. OneOps, a @WalmartLabs-led open source project, enables a consistent infrastructure provisioning and delivery mechanism in a cloud-agnostic fashion. And while Walmart Technology has employed OneOps to help manage more than 1,000 deployments daily across its many data center-based clouds, distribution centers have not been able to leverage the same convenience. This initiative aims to change that, standing up each distribution center as its own cloud, with OneOps provisioning the underlying virtual machines, as well as all other key technology components required for a Kubernetes cluster (see Figure 1). Figure 1: OneOps VMware distribution center interactions In the above diagram, integration between OneOps and VMware’s vCenter occurs via Fog adapters. This key integration allows distribution centers to use their existing VMware investments with minimal changes to DC infrastructure. Once this integration stands up the backing virtual machines, OneOps takes over by laying down the Kubernetes ecosystem directly onto these newly provisioned VMs. This convenient approach means that whether applications are in the cloud or on-premises, OneOps can facilitate a consistent infrastructure management experience across the enterprise. Predecessors to Kubernetes in Walmart’s distribution centers are open source successes in their own right (Nagios, Apache-Httpd to name a few). And while they have been relatively effective in meeting the current needs of the applications they serve, these disparate products require customized configurations and install scripts to provide a cohesive application deployment platform. As applications transition toward a microservice-style architecture, the overhead of managing these disparate components has increasingly made that transition much more difficult. Kubernetes has proven to not only meet the same needs provided by its open-source predecessors, but it is doing so in a much more efficient, stable and easier-to-manage fashion. With its roots grounded in years of Google cloud-computing experience, Kubernetes also brings with it powerful Docker container orchestration features to help enable a microservice architecture. These include: abstractions for managing application deployments and upgrades container monitoring and health checks isolated networking (via Flannel) workload scheduling auto-scaling enforced memory and CPU limits, per application / container, or namespace Applications provisioned within Kubernetes are assured to always be running and making the most efficient use of on-premises resources. This is accomplished with relatively little additional overhead, having just three small VMs dedicated as redundant master nodes. The complete provisioned cluster provides everything needed for an application execution ecosystem (figure 2): Figure 2: Kubernetes VM layout for a distribution center Master nodes ensure the cluster is running smoothly, tracking the status of each component, and handling API requests for deployments and updates; worker nodes remain busy executing application workloads; NFS servers meet locally shared file-system-based requirements; and load balancer nodes intercept and route external, non-Kubernetes based traffic into the cluster. Once the Kubernetes clusters are provisioned by OneOps, each freestanding cluster is hooked into Jenkins-based continuous delivery pipelines. These pipelines ensure applications are delivered to each distribution center in a timely and efficient fashion (see Figure 3). Figure 3: Jenkins / CD pipeline interactions with Kubernetes clusters Treating each application as its own isolated microservice component, Jenkins has proven to be a fast, effective tool for not only building software, but also as a foundational platform for Walmart’s continuous delivery pipelines. Jenkins alone isn’t sufficient as a deployment mechanism. Any Docker-based solution requires a solid image registry — that single “source of truth” for Docker binaries. Having already invested in Nexus for Java, dotnet, Linux RPMs and more recently, NPM-based artifacts, the obvious solution for Walmart Technology was to expand Nexus’ already impressive feature list to include Docker registry capabilities. Furthermore, given a distribution center’s autonomous nature, a local registry within each DC becomes a must to ensure clusters are able to operate independently and also buffer against excessive external network traffic. Once again, the same Nexus solution, but running as a more optimized Docker container image, is deployed within each DC’s Kubernetes cluster, serving mostly as a proxy and cache to the enterprise-wide registry (see Figure 4). Figure 4: Nexus (Docker registry) Topology As shown in the above diagram, Jenkins pipelines deliver application updates directly to the enterprise Nexus instance in the form of new Docker image versions. Each DC Kubernetes cluster pulls from the central image on-demand and caches these latest updates within the local file system. The resulting approach forms a complete federated image management infrastructure, powered by Nexus, Jenkins and Kubernetes. By combining these key open source products into a cohesive solution, Walmart Technology is able to deliver the level of flexibility and isolation its modern logistics systems require. Development teams are empowered to make the right technology choices for the solutions their logistics partners need. Walmart Logistics end users and management are happy because they can use existing distribution center assets and see improvements in the speed of delivery, systems uptime and asset utilization. And finally, Walmart customers ultimately benefit from a system that ensures their favorite items are in stock at Everyday Low Prices.

Here are three reasons why. Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Oct 31, 2016 at 6:33PM Image Source: Motley Fool.  Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) was tumbling again after last week's earnings, with shares falling 5% on Friday. Longtime observers of the company shouldn't be surprised. While most corporations try to deliver steady earnings growth to please shareholders, Amazon is as erratic as they come. Ramped-up investment was again to blame, as the company opened 18 new warehouses and stepped up video development to beef up Amazon Prime benefits. That kind of sudden slide in profits has happened to the company many times before, and CEO Jeff Bezos still likes to think of his company as a start-up even though its market cap is near $400 billion. Friday's sell-off and the company's sky-high valuation are a reminder that the stock is anything but stable. Shares could easily fall 30% again as they did at the beginning of this year. As the company continues to grow at a breakneck speed, here are its three biggest risks. 1. The boys in Bentonville In the court of public opinion -- and according to many conventional metrics -- Amazon seems to have vanquished Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), the world's biggest retailer. The e-commerce leader's market value is close to double that of Wal-Mart's, and its revenue is still growing by nearly 30%. Amazon's stock has been one of the best on the market in the last decade, while Wal-Mart's underperformed the S&P 500. But based on revenue and profits, Wal-Mart is still much bigger. Its resources, which include one of the largest trucking fleets in the U.S, a nationwide network of 5,000 stores, and more than 150 distribution centers, are unmatched by any other retailer. If any company can mount a worthy challenge to Amazon, it's Wal-Mart. After ignoring the e-commerce space for years, Amazon's prevalence has finally got its attention, and under CEO Doug McMillon the company is putting up its strongest growth since the recession. McMillon has made e-commerce a priority with the rapid expansion of its grocery pick-up program and the $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com earlier this year. He's also pushed the company to make investments in stores and wages that have driven comparable sales higher and made the chain a more attractive place to shop. Wal-Mart likes to say it has a store within five miles of 70% of Americans, giving it an advantage in any kind of omnichannel competition, and it has the supply chain and economies of scale to compete with anyone on price. With the Jet.com acquisition and the online grocery pick-up expansion in particular, you can expect the company to continue increasing its focus on e-commerce. 2. A potential recession With Amazon's triple-digit P/E ratio and fickle profits, the market is unlikely to treat the stock kindly during a recession as high-priced growth stocks tend to fall further than defensive dividend payers like Wal-Mart. In its earlier years, Amazon built its value proposition on low prices -- but with the rapid rise of its Prime loyalty program, convenience has become the biggest selling point for most of its customers. That shift also explains why Amazon continues to invest in enhancing Prime benefits by building more fulfillment centers and leasing planes to make deliveries even faster, and spending billions on content for its streaming service. If a recession hits -- and there's a decent chance that will happen in the next few years as the economy is about to enter its eighth straight year of expansion -- American consumers needing to pinch pennies may drop their $99 Prime memberships and shop instead at low-priced options like Wal-Mart, Costco, or dollar stores. That could zap the company's blockbuster growth and put pressure on the stock. 3. The law of large numbers  It's a cliche in business to say that no company can outgrow the economy forever. With 20 years of outstanding growth, Amazon may be doing its best to avoid the economic laws of gravity, but with revenue set to approach $140 billion this year, it will get harder to maintain that growth rate each year into the future as the company will have to find even more sales dollars. The U.S. retail market alone is worth more than $1 trillion, but Amazon isn't going to take it without a fight.  The company's model is better suited to some sectors than others, and while it's clear why it's been able to dominate categories like books and electronics, its ambition in grocery seems questionable. The e-commerce leader has plans to open 2,000 brick-and-mortar grocery stores over the next decade, a move that plays to none of its inherent advantages and is instead an area where Wal-Mart is better suited to succeed. Wal-Mart has already opened hundreds of kiosks in store parking lots to facilitate pickup of online orders, and should have close to 1,000 by the end of next year, meaning it's fast seizing the opportunity in grocery e-commerce. But if Amazon is going to keep growing at the rate investors expect, it needs to make a play for groceries, which represent a domestic market of more than $600 billion a year. Similarly, Prime is another key area for investment and growth, but at this point brand awareness in the U.S. is near 100%. Customer acquisition will become more difficult as the market gets more saturated, and Amazon will have to make the service even better if it wants to attract those customers. That again explains the investments in speedier delivery for new services like Prime Now, and why it's expanding Prime to new markets around the world.  Some of Amazon's ideas, like Amazon Web Services, have paid off richly, but with a market cap near $400 billion and relatively tiny profits, the stock still has plenty of risk. The Bezos-led behemoth has built an impressive set of competitive advantages, but Amazon will have to step outside its wheelhouse to continue delivering the kind of growth the stock's valuation demands. Even as it's become one of the biggest companies in the world, the stock will remain as volatile as ever.   Jeremy Bowman has no position in any stocks mentioned.

EST October 31, 2016 Vicki Carll was cleared of shoplifting when video showed a security guard setting her up. WTSP photo CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST Tampa, Florida -- Imagine shopping at a store paying the cashier and then moments later manhandled as you try to leave. This happened to a Tampa woman walking out of a Walmart. As 10Investigates explains how this woman claims she was not only framed - but physically detained over less than $30. The incident happened two years ago as Vicki Carll was walking out of a Tampa Walmart. Carll says, ”It was the most humiliating thing you could ever go through.” As soon as she walked out the door, two men grabbed her, manhandled her and dragged her back into the store. At the time Carll says she was baffled. “I didn't know what was happening, I thought I was being mugged,  actually, because I had $500 in my hand and I didn't know what was going on, I had no idea.” It turned out Carll was being arrested for shoplifting. The security guard who was waiting on a bench next to the exit said she stole flea medication worth $29. Click here to read complaint against Walmart Carll's attorney, Barry Cohen calls the incident , “Shameful! Shameful!” Cohen  claims this was an elaborate plan by the security guard to frame his client. In a lawsuit filed Monday afternoon, Cohen points out the security tape shows the guard, who just started that day, dumped something on the floor from a box and then seconds later accused Carll of stealing that item. According to Cohen, a veteran attorney, “I've never seen a case I can think about where the bad guy, in this case the Walmart employee, was actually caught on video planting the evidence. 10Investigates reached out to both Walmart and the Hillsborough State Attorney's Office. They would just tell 10Investigates they believe the guard, who said he found the medication in Carll's sleeve. Walmart asked the state to prosecute and a jury found her not guilty in less than a minute. 10Investigates talked to several jurors and one said it seemed obvious the guard planted the evidence and couldn't believe the state wasted time and money with this case. Walmart issued this statement: "This was an unfortunate event in a number of ways. We know how important it is to maintain a safe and secure environment for our customers and associates, and we continually evaluate and work to strengthen our safety measures. That's why we invest in crime prevention efforts and training aimed at deterring criminal activity in our stores and keeping our customers and associates safe." When we asked Carll, “What's this done to your life?” She paused, took a deep breath and sighed saying “It's hurt me a whole lot.” Carll says she has suffered mentally and physically and has filed a lawsuit against the retail giant. She says he no longer feels safe shopping in stores since the incident. “I just couldn't believe it happened and I hope it never happens to anyone else.” The security guard and a manager who grabbed Carll no longer work for Walmart, but the company tells us it's not due to this incident. Neither was disciplined for the case. Walmart also told us the men did not violate company policy by physically restraining the woman   CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS WVEC Live Breaking News Coverage BREAKING: School bus overturns in Norfolk An exclusive look inside Waterside District Middle school principal tackles comments 14-year-old shot twice Portsmouth Police look into rash of overdoses Heightened security over political unrest More Stories Wesley Hadsell sentenced to 20 years in federal prison Nov 15, 2016, 12:10 p.m. School bus overturns in Norfolk, minor injuries reported Nov 15, 2016, 7:51 a.m. Overnight police chase ends with no arrests Nov 15, 2016, 6:38 a.m. About Us Contact Us Meet The Team Help Connect With Us FCC Online Public Inspection File • EEO Public File Report Home Weather 7 Day Outlook Hurricane Center Closings & Delays Weather Maps Weather Cameras National Webcams More...

The Google Home assistant will be available starting November 4, this is when Google will ship the pre-ordered units, and this is when retailers should stock them and sell them online. Android Police reports that one of its readers actually saw the Google Home available for sale at their local Walmart. According to that reader, a Walmart employee would not sell him the Google Home device, likely when they tried to scan it at a register. Huge retailers like Walmart and Best Buy usually receive items before they are released, likely with specific instructions as to when they are to be available for sale. But it appears that whoever stocked, tagged, and priced the Google Home units on the shelf was not aware of an actual release date. Google Home is the companys first home-assistant device which will let you control Philips hue, activate IFFTT recipes, play music from Google Play or Spotify, as well as answer questions with the Google search engine at its disposal. Youll also be able to control your Chromecast and ask it to play videos from YouTube, or TV shows and movies from Netflix.

(Photo: Saul Loeb, AFP/Getty Images) Walmart has removed books featuring photos of child nudity from its website. The explicit photography books by Jock Sturges were not sold in Walmart stores but were available at Walmart.com. Last week, the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, an anti-pornography organization, launched a petition to remove those and other books and magazines the group says are offensive. “The books were in violation of our prohibited items policy and were removed as soon as they were brought to our attention,’’ Walmart said in a statement Monday. “We’re refining our policies and filters to better flag and block these types of items in the future.” Sturges has produced books featuring art photos of nude adolescents for decades. In 1990, The New York Times reported, the FBI raided his studio and confiscated his cameras, but a grand jury declined to indict him. He continued to work. A variety of his art books are on sale on Amazon's website. Dawn Hawkins, NCOSE’s executive director, applauded the change. “This is a major victory in our fight for a world free from sexual exploitation,’’ she said in a statement. The group says it is also seeking an end to the retailer selling Cosmopolitan magazine, which is says features sexually suggestive content that can be easily viewed by children shopping with their parents, and primers for the sex trafficking of women that NCOSE says are still sold online. "We are continuing communications with Walmart executives,'' Hawkins says, "and we hope Walmart will take further, swift action to ensure it stays true to its family-friendly brand by removing all other sexually exploitive materials," . 302 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 13 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2f6n4KX

Many residents are excited for the retail option, and the more than 200 jobs the store will create, while others remain fearful the store will hurt small businesses and offer only low-wages to its workers. Just another chapter for this region, that's how one local historian and journalist summed up the opening of Walmart's new super store in Derby. Development, he says, that started with the Interstate coming through. "Since then there has been a steady flow of businesses setting up here -- and this is just another chapter -- and now the Derby Road, for good or bad, is the commercial center for Orleans County," said Scott Wheeler with Northland Journal. He says there are still people who worry about the box store's impact on local down town stores. "A lot of people look at downtown Newport and wonder what's going to happen to Newport with Walmart," Wheeler said. One person who is convinced Walmart will be good for downtown Newport, is Newport Mayor Paul Monette. He is the new wireless manager at Walmart. "I think it is going to help downtown Newport in reality. I have looked at Littleton and also St. Albans, and I have seen how their downtowns have really thrived after Walmart," Monette said. Monette says he was laid off from his teaching job, so he -- like over 200 other people -- applied at the big box store. "We have hired a little over 250 now -- going for 350. We have had a really big turnout as far as applications, so it has made the hiring process fairly easy," said Tony Lane, a Walmart Manager. Stocking is now underway at the 176-thousand square-foot store. Hundreds of thousands of boxes are being unpacked around the clock, and stacked on shelves until the store opens for one stop shopping. "I think it will be good to just go to one store and get everything you need, and my daughter is working there," said Denise Gandreau, a nearby resident of Beebee Plain. Walmart officials say they have hired 11 assistant managers and two co-managers -- those are salaried positions. Everyone else will be paid by the hour starting at minimum wage -- $9.60. A grand opening is scheduled for November 16th.  Doors open at 7a.m. Related Stories: Wal-Mart groundbreaking marks major milestone in Derby Derby Wal-Mart project receives Act 250 approval Developer files Wal-Mart application in Derby Plans for Derby Walmart move forward Derby Walmart gets greenlight Local NewsMore>> NH police: Vt. man tried to sell marijuana to undercover cops NH police: Vt. man tried to sell marijuana to undercover cops Updated: Tuesday, November 15 2016 11:15 AM EST2016-11-15 16:15:27 GMT Police say a Vermont man has been arrested in New Hampshire after trying to sell marijuana to undercover police officers.

(NYSE: WMT) came under fire recently from an anti-pornography group for selling photo books the group says depict nude children and contain other exploitative materials. The National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE) sent a letter to Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon last week expressing its “grave concern” about the company’s distribution and sales of this material both in the company’s stores and at the walmart.com website. In a press release Monday, NCOSE said that Wal-Mart has stopped selling photography books by Jock Sturges that feature nude children. NCOSE is an organization founded in 1962 as Morality In Media. The group changed its name in February 2015 “to better describe the organization’s scope and mission, which is to expose the seamless connection between all forms of sexual exploitation.” Dawn Hawkins, executive director of NCOSE, said Monday: Walmart.com is no longer selling Jock Sturges’ photography books featuring eroticized child nudity. This is a major victory in our fight for a world free from sexual exploitation. Our petition campaign asking Walmart to remove these Sturges’ books, in addition to explicit magazines like Cosmopolitan and books like Pimpology that give instructions for sex trafficking women, received thousands of signatures within the first 24 hours. We are continuing communications with Wal-Mart executives, and we hope Wal-Mart will take further, swift action to ensure it stays true to its family-friendly brand by removing all other sexually exploitive materials. In its letter to McMillon, NCOSE called on Wal-Mart to remove Cosmopolitan magazine from its worldwide distribution and website along with books by photography books by Jock Sturges which the group said shows “naked young girls, boys, and adolescents with frequent exhibition of pubic regions.. NCOSE also requested a “complete review and removal from Walmart.com of any other sexually explicit and objectifying material.” The group extracted a pledge from Wal-Mart last year to ensure that Cosmopolitan magazine would be covered by blinders to prevent viewing by children. To date, NCOSE says, it continues to receive complaints that the magazine remains for sale at Wal-Mart checkout lanes.

Andrés Cardenal (TMFacardenal) Oct 31, 2016 at 4:05PM Image source: The Motley Fool. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST) are two of the world's leading discount retailers with remarkably different strategies regarding human resources. Wal-Mart has always been harshly criticized for paying insufficient wages, while Costco rewards employees with above-average pay and superior benefits. But Wal-Mart is borrowing a page from Costco's playbook, offering higher salaries and better working conditions. And that new approach is generating benefits for the company in terms of sales growth. Judging by recent financial reports from Wal-Mart, it looks as if what's good for employees can also be good for customers and investors. Wal-Mart is going the Costco way, but only partially Wal-Mart launched a series of bold initiatives in February 2015. Among other things, the company raised its minimum wage to $10, and wages for department managers increased from $12 to $15 an hour. According to an article in The New York Times, Wal-Mart has raised its average pay for full-time nonmanagerial employees to an average of $13.69 an hour, a 16% increase since early 2014. It's not just about wages, as the company is also offering improved opportunities for education and professional development. Wal-Mart has developed an onboarding and training program offering potential career paths for employees who are looking to move beyond entry-level positions. Associates in these programs receive hands-on training in areas such as merchandising, retail fundamentals, teamwork, and people skills. Those who successfully complete these programs get to climb the corporate ladder toward jobs with higher responsibility and better pay. Wal-Mart is also offering better conditions for associates in areas such as work schedule and benefits. The company is allowing employees to choose between more predictable or more flexible time schedules, according to their own needs, providing more control and ownership over their work and personal time. In addition, Wal-Mart is improving benefits related to healthcare, sick leave, and education. Chances are that Wal-Mart will never completely close the gap versus Costco when it comes to wages in particular and human resources policies in general. It's worth noting that Costco raised its minimum wage by $1.50 an hour, from $11.50 and $12 an hour to $13 and $13.50 an hour, this past March. That was the first minimum-wage increase from Costco since 2007, and the decision probably reflects the fact that other companies in the industry started raising wages, so Costco needs to do the same to stay ahead of the competition. Costco has a unique corporate culture in the retail industry, and its business model is quite particular. Since Costco operates completely under the warehouse retail model, the company makes more revenue per employee than other industry players, so Costco can naturally afford higher wages than Wal-Mart. Nevertheless, the fact remains that Wal-Mart has changed its strategy. As opposed to trying to increase profit margins by paying the lowest possible wages it can get away with, the company is offering better working conditions to improve customer service and keep operations running smoothly. This new approach to human resources is generating promising results. The move is paying off  During fiscal 2014, Wal-Mart suffered from declining comparable-store sales and negative traffic figures in the U.S. in every quarter. But things started to improve in fiscal 2015, and the recovery is quite noticeable nowadays. Comparable-store sales at Wal-Mart U.S. grew 1.6% during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, driven by a 1.2% increase in traffic. The company has produced positive comparable sales in the U.S. over the past eight quarters, while traffic has remained in positive territory over the past seven quarters in a row. According to CEO Doug McMillon, one of the main reasons sales and traffic are moving in the right direction is that the customer experience is improving, which is clearly related to having a friendlier and more motivated workforce. In McMillon's words: "We believe a contributing factor to the results is our consistent improvement in customer experience. Customer surveys indicate that we're making good progress in providing a better shopping experience with cleaner stores, faster checkout, and friendlier service." Wal-Mart is facing increasing costs, not only because of higher investments in employees, but also because the company is aggressively expanding its online retail capabilities. These initiatives are putting downward pressure on profit margins, but management is doing the right thing by prioritizing revenue growth and competitive positioning above short-term profit margins.  Employees aren't just an expense item on the income statement; they're one of the most important resources a business can have. As it turns out, investing in wages and other benefits can many times generate attractive returns for shareholders. Andrés Cardenal has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Home spotted in a Walmart store before market release By R Padla - October 31, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Your home is about to get smarter and more “wired” as Google Home is now available from Walmart. Well, it’s not yet official but the device has been sighted on the retail store even before the commercial launch. We’re guessing some employee made an honest mistake of putting the units on the shelves. That’s interesting since a Xiaomi Mi box was only spotted in a Walmart branch ahead of official market availability. Official release of the Google Home is November 4. Walmart already has the product so we know the scheduled release will be followed. Thing is, Walmart went ahead. Interestingly, the product isn’t available for sale yet when the source of this story tried to buy one. Google Home costs $129. We know Google is slowly moving the Google Cast system to Google Home. We also know it can be integrated with Spotify and other similar apps. Google Home with the Google Assistant directly rivals Amazon Echo and Alexa. Alexa may be more popular these days, being integrated with several products and services left and right, but the Google Assistant is more widely used. There’s also the fact that it’s from Google so the search function will be relevant and accurate. Google Home is also expected to be integrated with other services and products especially that it’s finally integrated with IFTTT and a channel is now open.

Jono Bacon, on right, chats with WalmartLabs' Jeremy King in a "fireside chat" at the All Things Open conference in Raleigh, North Carolina. Photo courtesy All Things Open. Related Media Microsoft Becomes a Card Carrying Open Source Citizen Starting a Career as an Open Source Developer Microsoft Open Sources PowerShell, Partners with Amazon Web Services, VMware, and Google Advertisement What do you do when your e-commerce site adds at least a million new products every month, and sometimes more than a million in a single week? According to Jeremy King, who is senior vice president and CTO for Walmart Global eCommerce, one of the things you do is invest in open source, both as a user and as a developer. But how do you convince the suits in the front office to release code developed in house as open source? "The good part about WalmartLabs is that we sort of didn't ask for permission," he admitted last week before a crowd of over 2,000 at the All Things Open conference in Raleigh, North Carolina. He was being interviewed on stage by ATO's master of ceremonies, community manager Jono Bacon, in a "fireside chat" during the opening day keynote sessions. "We sort of started off with that approach. As we got bigger, obviously you don't open source a product that you've spent resources on for a couple of years without really talking to the enterprise, so it really was a baby step as you go in." King has been with Walmart since 2011, a relationship that began with a phone call from a recruiter who told him he was representing a large company that had "underinvested in technology on the e-commerce side for a long time" but which had a policy of using "technology to lower costs of goods so we could give that back in price to our consumers." "I remember sitting at my desk saying 'Fortune One company, what is the number one company in the world?' and literally didn't even think about Walmart at the time as being the player that they were talking about," he remembered. "I had to look it up while I was talking to this person on the phone." At first, King and his team worked on "little things," such as Hapi, a framework for restful API services. As they began going to open source conferences, they were well received and began moving further into open source space, both as contributor and developer. "We really didn't have an open source contribution policy in the company, so that was really the first thing, and one of the things I wanted to stress for the organizations that are in here," he said. "It's great to accept and use open source technology, but as you get heavier and heavier into the use, you really need to turn back to your corporations and say, 'We need to have a contribution policy and let people contribute while they're working. Not just on their personal time, but actually contribute back.'" In other words, make sure the bosses understand that the open source model is only sustainable if sharing is a two-way street. "So we started off small, lots of JavaScript frameworks, our testing framework and a lot of things on the front end. But then we started getting serious. We bought a company called OneOps that was really a cloud provisioning tool. As we started using it, we decided that piece alone would be better if it was interconnected with more clouds." This led him to ask the question: "Do we want to build all the cloud connectors to all the different cloud providers or should we open source this and let it go?" Last October, OneOps was released as open source under the Apache License, which has become WalmartLabs' license of choice. This has led to the platform having "the ability to deploy on Rackspace, Azure or our own internal clouds, and with a click of a button you can move any one of your workloads from an internal cloud to an external cloud or any others. That was really our first way of saying 'this is something really big that I want to contribute.'" Although the open sourcing of OneOps was big news, King and his team recently made even bigger news when they open sourced another application. "The nice part about OneOps is that it's a platform that everyone can use, but it's one of those all-in-kind platforms," King explained. "As we worked with Facebook on React, we decided that React has a great set of capabilities, but it really needs some framework around it in order to use it. So we built a program we call Electrode and we just open sourced that around two weeks ago." In many ways, Electrode is the crown jewel of Walmart's portfolio of applications, as it's the platform used to power Walmart.com, a site that not only sees 80 million monthly visitors, but which makes 15 million items available for purchase. These efforts have certainly been beneficial for Walmart. Since taking King on board, the company has grown to become the second largest online retailer on the planet, just behind Amazon. The efforts have also been good for the development community as well. WalmartLabs' GitHub page currently lists eight pages of open source projects.

LDProd/iStock/Thinkstock Related Media Online produce sales click with consumers Advertisement Online grocery is poised for a major boom in 2017 as an increase in "click-and-collect" options from U.S. retailers like Kroger and Walmart facilitate a consumer shift from buying specific items online infrequently to buying large baskets more frequently. Deborah Weinswig, an analyst with Fung Global Retail & Technology in a report published Monday said the expansion of click and collect at retail will help close a gap between the large percentage of shoppers already making grocery purchases online and the relatively low percentage of fast-moving consumer goods purchased online overall. This shift will help the share of fast-moving consumer goods sold online to grow to more than 2% in 2017, up from about 1.4% this year. According to Fung, that would represent more than $24 billion in FMCG sales online in 2017, up from around $17 billion this year. According to Mintel figures cited in the report, nearly one-third of U.S. consumers are already shopping online for groceries — an increase of 63% from 2014. But sales are not proportionate because those shoppers tend to buy specific items, instead of baskets of goods on the Internet, and they don't use the Internet to shop as frequently as they do physical stores. Amazon currently dominates online grocery in the U.S., but that's due in part to the relative slowness with which brick-and-mortar retailers have moved online, Weinswig noted. That is changing this year as the two largest physical sellers of groceries in the U.S. — Wal-Mart Stores and Kroger, respectively — aggressively add "click-and-collect" capabilities allowing their customers to shop online and retrieve orders at local stores. Walmart through the second quarter was offering pickup in 60 markets and 400 locations; Kroger's ClickList offering had about the same number of locations through its second quarter. "Given the already substantial consumer participation rates, there look to be opportunities to convert the large body of occasional, small-basket online shoppers into shoppers who conduct their main grocery shops online," Weinswig said.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Oct 31, 2016 at 12:00PM In this segment from the Market Foolery podcast, Mark Reeth and Million Dollar Portfolio's Jason Moser consider the ongoing expansion at Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company is boosting its busy season staff expansion by 20% at a time when brick-and-mortar rivals are either holding their headcounts steady or shrinking them entirely -- a clear demonstration of how well Amazon continues to disrupt the traditional retail world.   A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 13, 2016 Mark Reeth: Let's move on to Amazon. Amazon made headlines today. As the holiday season approaches, a lot of retailers out there will hire seasonal workers. Amazon has announced it's going to add 120,000 seasonal positions this year. That's up from 100,000 last year. That growth rate speaks volumes, I think, to how Amazon has been successful about upsetting status quo with those old school retailers. For instance, you look at Target and Macy's, Target is going to hire 70,000 additional workers in its stores. That's the same as last year. Macy's is going to hire 83,000, that's down from 85,000 last year. Amazon increased its number by 20%. Again, it boggles the mind to think about how much Amazon has disrupted retail, but then you see numbers like this and suddenly it makes a lot of sense. Suddenly, it's all clear. Jason Moser: You know, a little bit more than a year ago, we were talking about the fact that Amazon had surpassed Wal-Mart in market cap. Amazon had become a bigger company by market capitalization than Wal-Mart, which was interesting from a number of different perspectives. One I kind of couldn't get over was the fact that Wal-Mart still does about four times the revenue that Amazon does today. Now, that gap is closing very quickly, but when we were talking about that 14, 15 months ago, all of a sudden Amazon has almost doubled the market cap of Wal-Mart. This is a very good example of that the market is a forward-looking mechanism that we always talk about. The market doesn't care as much about what you've done as it does about what you tell us you're going to do. When we look at Amazon, for example, we know that every holiday season, Jeff Bezos sees that as nothing but pure opportunity. The estimates for Amazon's revenue for this coming holiday are close to $45 billion in sales. Now, that's about 25% up from last year's numbers. That's right in line with when you're growing your sales at that rapid of a clip, particularly considering what Amazon does, you need to have the staff there to be able to fill that void, packing boxes, shipping stuff out, and all of that. I think the benefit that Amazon has here is they've always been very clear from the beginning that they want to be the world's most customer-centric company. That seems like an easy thing to say, but as you know, as I know, I think probably anyone out there that has ever worked in customer service in any capacity, customer service is really hard. I mean, it's really hard because you're working with a unique individual every single time. Their situation is unique to them and you want to try to make it the best experience possible for them. Now Amazon is focused on doing this on grand scale. Now, they know that customers really care about a couple of things: low prices and getting that stuff shipped to them as quickly as possibly. Lucky enough for Amazon, they do both of those things really, really well. That's why they staff up so heavily during the holiday season is because you're going to see I think over the course of the next 10 to 20 years, really ... Again, e-commerce is so young even though it's what we're used to, you think about it, my kids, for example, 10 and 11 years old now, they've never really known a world without e-commerce. I think that ... I like to look at their behavior in a lot of cases and try to sort of see how the investing world may look over the course of the next 10, 20 years and every time I look at them and their behavior, it just screams "buy Amazon, buy Amazon" because they've got a piece of everything, whether it's e-commerce, entertainment, music, cloud computing, and it just keeps on growing. Now, we see they're talking about establishing a little bit more of a physical infrastructure, possible bookstores, and/or convenience stores. It just goes on and on. We go back to talking about how important culture is and leadership and Amazon's success is certainly because of the people that work there, but Jeff Bezos is the man that really has executed on this vision and I think as long as he's around, you've got to really feel pretty good about Amazon's chances.

The price is correctly listed at $129 and it shows up in store, at least at the one location where we have a picture, nera other smart home products such as the Nest smart thermostat and products from Ecobee. While I’m sure many of you are about ready to take a trip to your local Walmart location, you may want to hold off. Apparently, Walmart employees are not allowed to sell Google Home to customers until November 4. I wouldn’t get my hopes up that employees can sell it to you “by mistake” either. Walmart likely has a block in the point-of-sale system for selling Google Home units until Friday. At the very least, this early stock of the Home in stores should help many with deciding on whether to order online and likely wait a few days to get their orders or just buy in store.

In the U.S., Feeding America estimates that 70 billions pounds of food is wasted annually—up to 40 percent of all food that's grown and transported throughout the country. Walmart, one of the world’s biggest grocery suppliers (it’s number one in the U.S.), acknowledged a need to combat the problem and started selling ugly fruits and vegetables—produce with surface defects that is still edible— at select stores in July. But the company reportedly has a long way to go to achieve a more sustainable anti-food waste operation.  CBC recently conducted investigations at two Walmart locations in Toronto, Canada and over the course of 12 visits found that employees tossed heaps of produce, baked items, frozen foods, unexpired meat and dairy and even unopened water bottles. According to the report, most of the food was still in its packaging, meaning the food couldn’t be composted and other components couldn’t be recycled. Several current and former Walmart employees confirmed the practice to CBC.  When asked about the trashed food, Walmart spokesman Alex Roberton told CBC that the company needed to do something to fix the problem. "For sure, there are mistakes being made and one thing we need to do is tighten up the execution of our in-store processes for the food that is going into the bins," said Roberton. "We need to be more certain that that is food that needs to be thrown out." RELATED: Texas Walmart serves up extreme deep-fried State Fair foods Roberton said that the company hopes to eliminate all food waste that’s winding up in landfills but right now, some food items are donated to local shelters or food banks --but would not specify how much. The company is also planning a "customer value program" to reduce prices on certain fresh items that are approaching their best-before dates.  Regarding the tossed food, however, Walmart first told CBC that the food was likely unsafe for consumption for a variety of reasons. If a refrigerated item is left out for even a short period of time, it has to be tossed for safety reasons. Still, Roberton acknowledged that doesn’t solve the haphazard disposal of perishables and packaging materials.  "If we're putting food that's good to eat in the wrong bin, then that's a mistake we need to correct," says Roberton. "And that's one of the areas that we need to focus on improving. Walmart has 407 locations across Canada and is one of the nation’s top five biggest grocery stores.

Traffic fatalities are up across the country, rising 7.2 percent from 2014 to 2015 – the largest single-year increase in 50 years. There are certain areas that are more dangerous than others, as AxleGeek found when they analyzed data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The analysis looked at cities throughout the U.S. with the most car fatalities per 100,000 people. Birmingham landed at number four on the list. Alabama's largest city had 19.3 auto fatalities per 100,000 residents in 2015. More than 12 percent of the total fatalities related to alcohol. Birmingham wasn't the only Alabama city on the list. Montgomery came in at number 34 with 12.5 traffic fatalities per 100,000 residents. Thirty-two percent of the city's total auto fatalities were related to alcohol. While Alabama had two cities make the list, Florida had a whopping five in the top 10 alone. Pompano Beach, Florida came in at number one, followed by Miami Gardens, Davie, Tampa and Lakeland. Eight other Florida cities - Fort Lauderdale, Miami, West Palm Beach, Jacksonville, Clearwater, Orlando, St. Petersburg, Palm Bay – were in the top 50 spots for fatal accidents. Welcome to Monday's Wake Up Call. Let's see what's going on: Walmart under fire for selling 'pornography' The National Center on Sexual Exploitation is hitting back at the nation's largest retailer for selling what it calls pornography. In a letter to Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, NCOSE said thequestionable material is available both in stores and via its website. Among the items noted in the letter are photography books by Jock Sturges, and books such as "Pimpology" and "The Pimp's Bible." NCOSE previously asked Walmart to cover up "Cosmopolitan" magazine in checkout lanes due to its content. Now, it's asking that the magazine be removed from Walmart stores and website. Powder sprinkled in orchestra pit halts opera A Dallas man brought a performance by New York's Metropolitan Opera to a halt after he sprinkled a white powder into the orchestra pit. The "powder" turned out to be the ashes of friend the man described as his "mentor." Roger Kaiser, 52, said he sprinkled the ashes at the opera house in recognition of his friend's love of music. His actions, however, led to the show bring cancelled and a response from the NYPD counter-terrorism squad, who tested the powdery substance. Police said Kaiser may not face any charges if the substance proved to be what he said it was. Manure dumped at Ohio Democratic office Law enforcement officials are trying to determine who dumped a large truckload of manure outside the headquarters of the Warren County, Ohio Democratic Party. The pile was first discovered early Saturday morning. The incident was caught on surveillance video but no arrests have been made. The pile was about 15 to 20 feet wide and 3 feet high. A similar manure dump occurred at the same office in 2012. Warren County is an overwhelmingly Republican area, with nearly 69 percent of its residents supporting GOP nominee Mitt Romney in 2012. Melania Trump to deliver campaign speech Melania Trump, the wife of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, will deliver her first campaign speech on Thursday. Melania Trump will be in Pennsylvania for a rally, the campaign announced. It's her first appearance on the campaign trail in months, after taking time off following her address at the Republican National Convention, when she was accused of plagiarizing part of a speech by First Lady Michelle Obama.

Sauter October 31, 2016 6:00 am EST Print Email Tweet Major retailers and shipping companies are expected to hire some 738,800 temporary workers to meet increased demand during the holiday shopping rush, according to estimates from staffing experts Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc. Macy’s, UPS, and Amazon have already announced plans to hire tens of thousands of seasonal workers, with others, including Wal-Mart, yet to announce exact figures. Online shopping continues to cut into sales of brick-and-mortar retailers on this list. Indicative of this is the fact that this year’s largest hirer of seasonal workers will likely not be Wal-Mart but Amazon, which is set to hire 120,000 seasonal workers — double Wal-Mart’s holiday hires last year. Most of these seasonal workers will be let go when the shopping season ends. 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the 13 companies hiring the most employees this holiday shopping season. Americans have historically done much of their holiday shopping at department stores such as Macy’s and Wal-mart. In recent years, however, online retailers such as Amazon have become a popular alternative. According to a study published this year by consulting firm Deloitte, 47% of consumers plan to spend as much online as they will in stores. Click here to see the retailers hiring the most for the holidays.  The increasing popularity of online shopping is apparent during the holidays, by far the busiest shopping period of the year. Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, kicks off the holiday shopping season with the biggest single day for retailers. However, some have been staying at home, waiting for online deals the following Monday, or Cyber Monday, as it is now called. To cover the expected additional sales, Amazon plans to hire 20,000 more seasonal workers than it did last year. The growing popularity of online shopping is also largely responsible for the increased seasonal hiring at shipping companies such as FedEx and UPS. According to John Challenger, CEO of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, “The sector with the biggest increase in holiday hiring in recent years has been transportation and warehousing, as more and more holiday shopping is done online.” With the continued success of e-commerce, brick-and-mortar retailers are struggling. Macy’s profits declined by 30% last year, and J.C. Penney has reported a net loss in each of the past three years, shaking shareholder confidence. Macy’s stock is currently trading at less than half its 10-year high, and J.C. Penney stock has lost nearly 90% of its value over the last decade. To identify the retailers adding the most seasonal jobs for the 2016 holiday, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the announced holiday hires of top retailers based on revenue in the Retail 100. Because their businesses are so closely related to retail, we also examined seasonal job additions at FedEx and UPS. Financial data were obtained from financial documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) when available. Store counts are all customer-facing U.S. locations operated by the company. Editor’s note: In an earlier version of this piece, it was implied that Wal-Mart had begun to hire new workers to fill positions as “holiday helpers.” Rather, the company is reassigning other current staff to fill these positions. These are the retailers hiring the most this holiday season.

By Aimee Picchi MoneyWatch October 31, 2016, 5:15 AM Holiday helpers and “theater”: Retailers go big this season Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email A battle is raging for consumers’ wallets this holiday season, and it’s going to involve glamour, red curtains, selfie booths and price wars. Brick-and-mortar retailers like Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) are doubling down on their preparations for the season, rushing to snap up temporary workers to make shoppers’ sugarplum dreams come true. With consumers coming off their first year of household income gains since 2007, retailers are counting on them to boost their holiday spending by anywhere from about 4 percent to10 percent this year. That could lift the season’s sales to their highest level since the recession. At the same time, consumers are increasingly shopping online, taking advantage of free shipping offers and price discounts from Amazon (AMZN) and the like. That’s raising the stakes for big retailers to create unusual experiences inside their stores as a way to lure consumers away from their computers and smartphones.  Play Video CBS This Morning How rise in online shopping and returns is hurting retailers The New Year could bring uncertainty to the nation’s retailers. Holiday sales at brick-and-mortar stores grew, but less than expected last year, ... Walmart stores will have “holiday helpers,” or workers parked near the checkout lines who can fetch forgotten items, and selfie booths, while Target plans “elements of theater” in its stores, as well extra staff and a special area for holiday trimmings. “What we see the leading retailers doing is creating emotional experiences in their stores,” said Steven Barr, PwC’s U.S. retail and consumer leader, earlier this month. “I like to say that a website can’t give you goosebumps.” Barr said stores have realized that shoppers respond to experiences, such as in-store beauty bars where friends can visit together while shopping, or product demonstrations. That’s clearly a lesson that Walmart and Target have absorbed and will trot out this holiday season. “In all of our stores from Nov. 5 through Dec. 17 (excluding Nov. 26), we’ll offer demos of the latest top toys so parents can try before they buy and see what’s most exciting to their kids,” said Target spokeswoman Erin Conroy. “Guests will see elements of theater -- like spotlights and red stage curtains -- and the word ‘spectacular’ woven throughout the store.” Target is pinning some of its holiday hopes on a store-within-a-store concept called Wondershop. which will feature roughly 2,000 new products with a focus on “holiday trim.” (Think wrapping paper and ribbon.) It has also invested in remodeling 82 stores where it sees the most demand for order pickup, a service that lets consumers pick up an item in the store after ordering it online. Of course, there’s also the battle over prices. Starting in mid-November, Target will offer $10 off a $50 purchase in departments that will rotate each week, such as grocery or home. Walmart, which has been rebuilding its image under CEO Doug McMillan, says it’s also offering competitive deals. Addressing a recent complaint of poor service, the company said it’s deploying an “army of holiday helpers” who will assist shoppers while they’re in the checkout line. It’s also hiring Santas to make 23,000 appearances during the holiday shopping season.  © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.. All Rights Reserved.

LATEST VIDEOS More Videos: Rates from Bankrate.com Mortgage Credit Cards Auto Wal-Mart, Target each take cue from the other for holidays 10/31/2016 - 2:00 AM EDT NEW YORK >> Wal-Mart and Target are each taking a cue from the other this holiday season. After years of emphasizing low prices, Wal-Mart wants to up the ante, but it also wants to be known for top customer service. Target, which has a better image in that regard, has stressed a focus on offering deals. The shift underscores how traditional retailers have to perfect every aspect of their operations as shoppers who could easily shop online instead become more demanding about price, selection and service. With online leader Amazon.com cementing customers with its juggernaut Amazon Prime shipping service, retailers like Target and Wal-Mart need to offer more exclusive merchandise. More Headlines Starbucks turns to customers for annual holiday cup designs US stocks finish level as tech losses cancel out bank gains BUSINESS IN BRIEF: Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Fox & Roach, Realtors hosts leadership event The economy that Trump inherits: Durable but sluggish After election, are shoppers ready to think about holidays? Heading into the critical holiday shopping season, Wal-Mart has the momentum. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company raised its profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth consecutive quarterly increase in a key revenue measure. Target had cut its profit forecast as customer traffic fell for the first time in a year and a half during the second quarter. Its key revenue measure also fell. "Wal-Mart has been benefiting from better service and for this holiday season, it should be a boon," said Ken Perkins, president of research firm Retail Metrics LLC. "I expect Wal-Mart will outpace Target. Target has a big price hurdle." ON SERVICE: Wal-Mart has been working to improve service in its stores, and its move to raise wages and increase training for hourly workers has helped. For the end of the year, the world's largest retailer plans to deploy "holiday helpers" stationed at the checkouts, who can direct customers to registers with shorter lines or even run back to the aisles to pick up an item someone forgot. It's adding staff to handle customers picking up online orders at the stores, and designating a manager for that area. During the holiday season, Wal-Mart sees five times as many same-day pickup orders compared to a normal week. The goal: To make sure shoppers have an easy experience when they come to collect their orders. "We want to serve the customer as they want to be served," Wal-Mart's Chief Operating Officer Judith McKenna, said at a store in Teterboro, New Jersey, on Wednesday. For service, Target is also focusing on making online ordering and pickups easier. Starting Nov. 1, it'll have 1,106 stores that will ship directly to online shoppers, double the current number. That should speed up delivery, and Target will be able to fulfill more orders. Online shoppers also can pick up their orders at all of Target's stores. ON PRICE: Wal-Mart promises to be even more aggressive on prices as part of an investment of several billion dollars over the next few years. It similarly plans to offer more consistent pricing, instead of shorter-term deals. For example, a Roku 32-inch HDTV that was priced at $125 last year during a Black Friday sale will have the same price all season this year. Skinny jeans that sold last year for around $9 are now $7.88. 1 2 next  last »

Brad Sibley said. Reagan Principal Andrew Bullock was notified around 1:45 p.m., and the schools were locked down, with a police presence, until about 2:15 p.m., when they told school administrators it was safe for kids to be released. A couple of bus schedules were thrown off a bit, but every student got on and was taken home. No injuries were reported. By the time officers arrived at Walmart, the suspect – described as teen boy – had fled north into the woods between the train tracks and Dixon Rehabilitation & Health Care Center. At one point, officers had him in sight and tried to establish a perimeter, but he escaped and has not been caught, Sibley said. At no point were there any threats of violence or any references to a weapon, so the department was “being very precautionary” by locking down the schools while they collected more information, he said. “With no threat of violence, it’s just a kid running from us,” Sibley said, adding that police are looking at Walmart surveillance footage to try to get a more thorough description of the suspect. Superintendent Margo Empen said parents were made aware of the situation by phone. “Obviously, Walmart is very close to our property,” Bullock said. “But nothing ever endangered anyone here.” It’s the schools’ first lockdown of the school year, he said, “and hopefully, the only one.” Related Links Sterling school district plans to begin abating taxes Preliminary levy increase triggers hearing for Dixon school district The definition of generosity in Sterling LEARN AND LIVE: Follow those kids Patients have some good friends at Sterling grade school Polo alum focuses on solutions to student struggles More News Sterling school district plans to begin abating taxesNov. 15, 2016 - 9:59 am Preliminary levy increase triggers hearing for Dixon school districtNov. 15, 2016 - 9:54 am Council’s new director wants to bring it all together for developmentNov. 15, 2016 - 9:50 am The definition of generosity in SterlingNov. 14, 2016 - 10:05 pm Relief effort in Dixon is quite an operationNov. 15, 2016 - 9:42 am LEARN AND LIVE: Follow those kidsNov. 14, 2016 - 10:08 pm Comments National video Tweets from https://twitter.com/saukvalley/lists/svm-news-sports-staff Reader Poll What do you think of the people who have marched in U.S. cities to protest Donald Trump’s election as president?

Highly weighted course work adds to student anxiety Retail’s nightmare before Christmas November 1, 2016 Rachel Sterzai Opinion No comments Tim Burton’s Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) / collider.com   Tis the season to get spooky and get in the holiday spirit, apparently. While you may have noticed the past month or so had most store covered in Halloween decorations, it’s hard to pass through a Walmart, dollar stores or even some residential neighbourhoods without seeing the tell-tale signs of flashy lights and giant Santas. But the real world isn’t exactly like Tim Burton’s iconic duo-holiday film, The Nightmare Before Christmas. I’m all for holidays and being cheery but there’s something weird about starting one celebration before another is even over. Halloween is a time for the dark and scary which is definitely contrasted by the holiday seasons’ bright and happy vibes, and I don’t see the two mixing well. Is all of November and December really not enough for the holidays? While it is based around Christian religious beliefs, Christmas is one of the most widely celebrated holidays around the world. Millions oonsibilities that don’t involve eating mass quantities of food. Even if you don’t celebrate, it’s still a time for relaxation. Christmas holidays away from home, time off from school for kids and lots of home cooked meal. But before we get there, there are still two whole months between Halloween and Christmas. In this time, fill the store with decorations, candy and Michael Buble’s seasonal album. However, I think the time before October 31 should be reserved for the ghoulish side of things. Not only does speeding up the holiday transition make some people uncomfortable, but also – as a student – I feel like it makes deadlines seem a lot closer than they really are. If I’m already supposed to be getting in the Christmas spirit, should I be thinking about exams, too? Because I’m honestly not ready for that. There is still so much to happen before the holidays can. As November begins, people do not often recognize Remembrance Day. Canada is supposed to be pretty patriotic, and thinking about those who fought for our country takes the backburner to Christmas and even Halloween because it’s not a largely celebrated holiday. And on the note of other holidays, while Christmas is such a major focus it takes the attention away from equally important times, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa. These are important holidays for many people in North America and should not be overshadowed by Christmas just because of its secular Santa Claus Christmas is one of the most highly celebrated times of the year, but I think when it comes to the advertising of it, it’s very much a consumer oriented event and marketed in a way that makes it seem like companies just want attention. ‘Buy these decorations,’ ‘eat all these cookies’ and ‘spend all the money on presents for everyone you know.’ Don’t get me wrong, I’m incredibly invested in getting into the ‘Christmas spirit’ myself, but I don’t think half the year should be dedicated to the material aspect of the season. However it’s also a time to spend with family and friends; gifts are just an added bonus. Each holiday is special and deserves attention, so don’t go too crazy and remember what they’re there for. So, let Halloween finish before you start decorating the house and getting ready for Santa – Christmas will definitely get it’s fair share of time. 2016BrockCanadalocalprotest About Rachel Sterzai View all posts by Rachel Sterzai → Tweet Pin It Related Posts The St. Catharines Record Show: everythi...

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Dell's Black Friday 2016 Xbox One S Deal Is The One To Beat Posted: Nov 1 2016, 10:11am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Nov 1 2016, 11:34pm CDT, in News | Black Friday   This story may contain affiliate links.   The Dell Black Friday 2016 Ad features the best Xbox One S Black Friday 2016 deal. The sales managers at Amazon, Best Buy and Walmart are likely having to change their planned Xbox One S Black Friday 2016 deals. Dell advertises in the Dell Black Friday 2016 ad released today, a Xbox One S bundle deal that saves shoppers $170. Don't Miss: Hatchimals in Stock at Walmart Dell will offer the Xbox One S 500GB Battlefield 1 with Gears of War 4 game and an extra Xbox One Wireless controller for $249.99. The combined value of the three items in the bundle are $419.99. The total savings are $170 and this is no fluff. Dell makes the Xbox One S Black Friday 2016 deal more desirable with selling it $50 less than the Xbox One S 500GB Battlefield 1 sells now. The offer is cheaper and you get free stuff worth $120. Now the bad part. The Dell Xbox One S Black Friday 2016 deal will be very hard to get. The online doorbuster deal will go on sale at 9pm ET on Thanksgiving Day on dell.com. To get this deal, you have to be fast with your mouse. We also recommend to sign-up to the Dell reward membership program as Dell is granting members early access to Black Friday 2016 deals. It is not known yet if the Xbox One S deal is part of that early access, but it could be. Dell is also launching today, November 1 a 24-hour today deal with up to 35% off a limited selection of laptops, desktops, TVs and accessories. This Dell sale starts today at 8am ET and will end on 11/2 7am ET on dell.com.

(Reuters/Eduardo Munoz) Share Written by Ismat Sarah Mangla November 01, 2016 Every holiday season, the stakes get higher for brick-and-mortar retailers fighting off the rise of online sites like Amazon. And with good reason: The National Retail Federation expects online sales in the US to jump from 7% to 10% this holiday season, while research firm PwC predicts that e-commerce will rise by 25%. Better discounts and customer service haven’t managed to stem the tide of harried holiday consumers turning to online shopping. So this year, brick-and-mortar retailers are doubling down on in-person “experiences” consumers won’t find on their smartphones and laptops. Wal-Mart is rolling out selfie booths for consumers to snap pics of themselves and Santas roaming the stores, and “holiday helpers,” employees who stand guard at checkout lanes and help (or nag at) customers to retrieve forgotten items. Target has said it’s rolling out toy demonstrations, along with in-store marketing that will feature “elements of theater” like spotlights and red stage curtains. Both stores plan to offer “exclusive products” you can’t find online. Those include a $400 Disney Princess Carriage at Wal-Mart, and a 10-disc box set from Garth Brooks, featuring the 25th anniversary edition of “Friends in Low Places” at Target. For its part, Home Depot has created a new app that lets customers get directions to an item they’re looking for in the store, along with information on inventory and what other locations might carry the item. Lord & Taylor is offering an app that allows customers to live-chat with a salesperson while shopping; Saks Fifth Avenue is enlisting an army of personal shoppers to help people pick out gifts. Employing all those extra hands is a risky bet. Retailers angling for a leg up are already scrambling for seasonal workers, which has put upward pressure on wages. The typical non-seasonal hourly rate of $10 to $12 is expected to climb by $1.50 to $3 an hour during the fourth quarter, according to Prologistix, a large US logistics staffing company. Incorrectly estimating staffing needs has hit retailers and logistics companies in the past. More online shopping and harsh winter weather cost UPS some $200 million in overtime pay, customer refunds, and other overruns costs in 2013, according to the Wall Street Journal. “What we see the leading retailers doing is creating emotional experiences in their stores,” said Steven Barr, PwC’s U.S. retail and consumer leader. “A website can’t give you goosebumps.” The question is whether the goosebumps will pay off. Correction: An earlier version of this article said the toy demonstrations at Target would feature “elements of theater.” It is the in-store marketing that will include those elements, not the toy demonstrations.

Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Nov 1, 2016 at 9:09AM Uncertainty about who will become the next president is helping to put holiday spending on track to fall below below last year's record numbers. Consumers are taking a more cautious approach to the holiday season, at least until the presidential race ends, according to the National Retail Federation's (NRF) annual consumer spending survey conducted by Prosper Insights & Analytics. The research found that people will spend an average of $935.58 during the holiday shopping season, down from 2015's record $952.58. "Everywhere you turn -- whether you're picking up a newspaper or watching television -- political advertisements are taking up ad space that retailers typically use to get holiday shopping on the minds of consumers across the country," NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay said in a press release. Customers shop at a Wal-Mart on a Black Friday. Image source: Wal-Mart. It's not going to last The good news for retailers is that barring a protracted tallying, like what happened between Al Gore and George Bush in 2000, Election Day should end the uncertainty. Even though either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump supporters will be disappointed after Nov. 8, the public will at least know who has won, and television will move back to regular commercials. "Once the election has passed, we anticipate consumers will pull themselves out of the election doldrums and into the holiday spirit," Shay said. The NRF, in a separate poll, found that 43% of the American buying public say they "are being more cautious with their spending due to the uncertainty of the election season." That seems like a bad sign, but the survey also found that 87% of consumers could be convinced "to spend an extra $25 this holiday season if tempted by a good sale or promotion, the perfect gift for themselves or others or free shipping." "Retailers should prepare for a rush of consumers in the weeks following the presidential election as they get more economic and political certainty and are looking to take advantage of promotions and deals that are too good to pass up for their friends, family and even themselves," Shay said. Consumers are starting early Despite the uncertainty of the election people are cautiously starting their holiday shopping well before Black Friday. The NRF research showed that 41% of shoppers began in October while the same amount will begin shopping in November. Only 18% will wait until December. "While many holiday shoppers are starting early on their gift lists, Millennials are waiting to catch the best deals for their gifts, with nearly half (46 percent) waiting until November to start shopping," Prosper Insights Principal Analyst Pam Goodfellow said. "Younger consumers are likely to be looking forward to the Thanksgiving/Black Friday shopping 'experience' -- and know that retailers will be offering great promotions that weekend." Stores are starting early Department stores and big-box retailers like Target (NYSE:TGT) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) have pushed the start of the holiday season earlier each year. That includes opening on Thanksgiving, which both of those chains have done in recent years and launching Christmas merchandise before Halloween products have been cleared from the shelves. That makes sense given the increased competition for holiday dollars. In addition to having to deal with election uncertainty, retailers like Wal-Mart and Target would do well to take note of one other trend, according to NRF's research. "Many shoppers are taking the approach of 'one for you, two for me' this holiday season," Shay said. "Retailers are preparing by offering a wide array of merchandise and promotions -- items shoppers want to give as great gifts at prices so good they want to buy for themselves too." That's an attitude that seems perfectly reasonable in a season defined by political unrest. The election's impact may fade by the time Thanksgiving, Black, Friday, and Cyber Monday roll around, but for now shoppers are being cautious. Still, stores need to be ready for a giant post-vote exhale. Daniel Kline has no position in any stocks mentioned. He does very little holiday shopping (so you're not getting a gift).

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds subscribe Site Archive Life-saving presentations, no action items on Wednesday's city council agenda Tuesday Nov 1, 2016 at 12:01 AM Jessica Weston City Editor Jessica_Weston9 In what may be another brief meeting, the Ridgecrest City Council is looking at an agenda with no discussion/action items for Wednesday, the last meeting before the election November 8. Police Chief Ron Strand will make two life-saving award presentations. So honored will be Officers Cory Ballestero and Richie Garibay, along with residents Adam Southard and William Sample—all of whom saved a life during a mobile home fire on Oct. 3, 3016. Two consent calendar items relate to easements. In one, council will be asked to accept a grant of easement from Russell and Tina Warren offering 25 feet of their property to “meet the half street Right of Way width of 55 feet for S. Downs.” The property is located at the southeast corner of  “future W. California Ave. and S. Downs Street and along the frontage of South Downs St.” according to the staff report. In another consent calendar item, council will be asked to accept a grant of easement from Walmart Stores along South China Lake Boulevard, East Bowman Road and South Silver Ridge Street. The streets in question bound the new Walmart Super Store. Also on the consent calendar is an item asking for approval of the disability retirement of Police Patrol Officer Thomas Dilley. A string of consent calendar items relate to contract change orders on projects with contract Griffith Company, Inc. In another consent calendar item, council will be asked to approve a contract change order for $5,877.80 in charges for various “additions and subtractions” to the West Graaf Street Improvement Project. Another consent calendar item involves potentially approving $18,766.44 in charges for changes to the East Drummond Avenue Project. Another consent calendar item involves a change order of $3,395 in charges for changes to the North Warner Street Improvement Project. A final consent calendar item involves a change order with a decrease of $390 and another with a charge of $23,287.17 for the West Drummond Widening and Realignment Project. The closed session will begin at 5:30 p.m. Two items are listed: potential ligation with Kern County and potential litigation with Southern California Edison. The regular council meeting is scheduled for Wednesday Nov. 2 at 6 p.m., at City Council Chambers at City Hall, 100 W. California Ave in Ridgecrest. It will also be broadcast on Mediacom Channel 6 and streamed online at www.ridgecrest-ca.gov/city-media/rc6-live.

She helped overturn a ballot measure that increased electric rates for businesses and lowered them for the poor. “Instead of defending poor people and righting wrongs, we found ourselves squarely on the side of corporate greed against the little people,” her colleague, Webb Hubbell, later wrote. The future presidential contender worked for 15 years as a corporate litigator at the Rose Law Firm in Arkansas’s capital, longer than any other position in or out of government. Her portrait still hangs in the firm’s downtown offices. Arkansas first lady Hillary Clinton in 1985 before one of her husband’s inaugural balls.

LYNN/ASSOCIATED PRESS Yet that chapter in her life has been all but excised from the official Hillary Clinton story. She hardly ever mentions it on the campaign trail. Her husband skipped past it when telling of her life story at the Democratic National Convention. Until August, it wasn’t even mentioned on her campaign’s official biography. It illustrates a pattern apparent through Mrs. Clinton’s career and into this year’s presidential campaign: She emphasizes different roles for different audiences. During her time in Arkansas, she was an advocate for children and families, and a successful lawyer at a white-shoe, mostly male law firm, representing the state’s biggest corporations. This characteristic leads many supporters to predict she would build governing coalitions if she becomes president. Opponents, including some on the left of her own party, conclude it means she lacks core convictions. The duality was on display in transcripts of paid speeches Mrs. Clinton gave to Wall Street firms before she entered the presidential race. As a candidate, she has emphasized the need for tough regulation of Wall Street. In those addresses, she pointed to the industry’s contributions.

FBI Reviewing New Evidence in Clinton’s Email Server Case Trump Adds $10 Million of His Own Money for Ads Early Voting Bolsters Clinton in Key States “More thought has to be given to the process and transactions and regulations so that we don’t kill or maim what works,” she said in one speech underwritten by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., according to a transcript that was stolen from her campaign chairman’s email account. Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon pointed to her advocacy work during her Rose years. “From the day she left law school, Hillary Clinton has never stopped being an advocate for children and families,” he said. “This period was among her most active years as Arkansas’ First Lady, when she introduced a new early childhood education program and expanded health access to rural parts of the state.” Mrs. Clinton’s years at the firm included some controversy. For one, the roots of the Whitewater affair reach back to her years at Rose when her husband was serving as Arkansas governor. The firm and Mrs. Clinton represented a failed savings-and-loan association run by James McDougal, the Clintons’ partner in the Whitewater real-estate investment, in a matter before state regulators. Whitewater dogged the Clintons throughout Bill Clinton’s presidency, though neither of them was ever charged. For Hillary Clinton, 1993 was one of the most brutal years of her political career. Marked by scandal, harsh media coverage and the defeat of her health-care plan, the year began her transformation into the tough, cautious candidate she is today. When her husband ran for president in 1992, her work at Rose sparked questions about whether she had benefited from state business handled by her firm. Mrs. Clinton denied that it had. “For goodness’ sake, you can’t be a lawyer if you don’t represent banks,” she said at the time. Two of her best friends at the firm followed the Clintons to Washington. One of them, Mr. Hubbell, eventually went to prison after it was discovered he had stolen from the firm. They haven’t spoken since. “She doesn’t talk to me,” Mr. Hubbell said in a recent interview. The other friend, partner Vincent Foster, committed suicide. Mrs. Clinton, known then as Hillary Rodham, joined the Rose Law Firm in 1977. She had followed Mr. Clinton to Arkansas and was teaching at the University of Arkansas law school when he was elected attorney general and planned a move to Little Rock. She had worked with Mr. Foster on a project, and he helped recruit her to the firm, which was founded in 1820 and bills itself as the oldest law firm west of the Mississippi River. At the law school, she had run a legal-aid clinic for the poor. Many of the Rose firm’s clients were big companies, including three of the state’s largest: Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Tyson Foods Inc. and Stephens, Inc., a brokerage firm. In one way, the Rose years reinforce a theme of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign—that she is a pioneer for women. She was the firm’s first female associate, and two years later, its first female partner. Although many partners welcomed her to the firm, some initially worried how they would introduce her to clients and what would happen if she became pregnant, Mr. Hubbell recalled. When she did have a child, she has said, some partners were surprised that she expected to be paid during her maternity leave. Some people who worked with her said her casual dress and look were out of step with Southern women of that era. “Her appearance was much more stodgy and old maid-ish,” said Joe Giroir, one of her partners from that era. “I don’t think she ever had a real feel of Arkansas.” Mr. Giroir said there was just one woman in his law school class, and for years he had “misgivings about female attorneys because I felt like their family obligations were going to interfere” with their work. He said he changed his mind after seeing a female lawyer in Houston do a good job with a case. Inside the firm, lawyers were split over Mrs. Clinton’s value as a partner, according to Mr. Hubbell and others. Mrs. Clinton recruited Amy Lee Stewart to the firm and mentored her. “Whenever I needed anything, wanted to ask a question, needed help with the right angle on a brief, I’d say, ‘Do you have a few minutes?’ ” recalls Ms. Stewart. “She’d say, ‘Come in. Let’s have a cup of tea and cookies.’ ” Other colleagues resented Mrs. Clinton’s outside interests and how they limited her billable hours. In addition to time away campaigning for her husband, who was on the ballot every two years, she served as chairwoman of both the Legal Services Corp. and the Children’s Defense Fund and led efforts to revamp Arkansas’s education system. “You can say that, well, perhaps from one perspective she wasn’t as productive as other partners were,” says Jerry Jones, a Rose colleague. “But from another perspective, what a great role model. She is able to balance all of these things and be successful at them.” As first lady in 1996, Mrs. Clinton gave a deposition as part of a Whitewater inquiry in which she talked about how her attentions were divided in the mid-1980s. “I was engaged in a lot of pro-bono public activities,” she said. “I spent much of 1982 campaigning nearly full-time for my husband. I spent much of 1983 heading up the Arkansas Education Standards Committee, so that my time was not solely devoted to law practice by any means.” At Rose, her share of the profits was tied to the business she generated, so her time on outside civic and political activities meant she earned less than other partners. She supplemented her income by serving on corporate boards including Wal-Mart and TCBY Enterprises, the yogurt franchise, both Rose clients. She wrote in her 2003 memoir, “Living History,” that she “worried that because politics is an inherently unstable profession, we needed to build up a nest egg.” By 1991, she was earning just over $100,000 from the firm, plus another $60,700 from director’s fees, according to news reports at the time. As governor, Mr. Clinton earned $35,000 that year. In her 2003 book, Mrs. Clinton writes only briefly about her work at Rose. She highlights a couple of cases, including her first jury trial, where she defended a canning company sued by a man who found the rear end of a rat in his pork and beans. He claimed he couldn’t kiss his fiancée because every time he thought about the situation he would spit. Mrs. Clinton argued the man hadn’t suffered any real damages and because the rodent part had been sterilized it would be considered edible in parts of the world. She said the plaintiff won “only nominal damages.” Mrs. Clinton didn’t identify the name of the man or the company involved. After that, she rarely appeared in trial. She took on some family-law cases, such as a father fighting for custody of his 6-year-old daughter, and a family that wanted to adopt their foster child, which ran counter to the rules then in place. The bulk of her cases involved defending large corporations, a Wall Street Journal review of court records suggests. She represented a supplier of Jenn-Air products in a contract dispute between a distributor and supplier. She represented the cosmetics maker Maybelline Co. seeking to stop a competitor from advertising its mascara as “clean lash” because, Maybelline contended, it wasn’t actually waterproof. She defended a company accused of wrongfully terminating an agreement to distribute natural-food products. She represented First Nationwide Bank when it argued that Nationwide Savings and Loan was violating its trademark by using the term “Nationwide Savings.” And when a former employee of the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Arkansas argued he had been wrongly denied disability benefits, she represented the company. Another partner, Herbert Rule, remembers a case in which a wealthy timber owner left the bulk of his $17 million estate to Arkansas College. When the man died at age 94, his recently hired female caregiver produced another will that left most of the money to her. The firm sued on behalf of the college. “At a meeting with the lawyers representing the caregiver, Hillary spoke up after 30 minutes in a loud voice, pointing to the caregiver and said, ‘Everyone knows you told him what to do, and he did it. You told him to change his will, and he did,’ ” Mr. Rule recalled. A long silence and “some muttering” by the caregiver followed, he said. About two weeks later, the case settled, he said, with the bulk of the money going to the college. Webb Hubbell, left, with Bill Clinton in Little Rock in 1986, was one of Mrs. Clinton’s closest friends at the Rose Law Firm.

PHOTO: JOHN SYKES/LIAISON/GETTY IMAGES “This was a remarkable example of Hillary’s strategic insight and chutzpah, two of her remarkable traits,” he said. The electricity-rate case was already under way when she joined the firm in 1977. In November 1976, the activist group Acorn, which is now largely defunct, had succeeded in getting onto the ballot an initiative, dubbed LifeLine, to lower electricity rates for low-income users and increase them for businesses. It passed. The Rose team’s argument was that it amounted to an unconstitutional taking, a line of reasoning Mr. Hubbell credits in part to Mrs. Clinton. “We hated seeing her on the other side of the table,” says Wade Rathke, founder of Acorn, who was friends with her husband at the time. “We had never been confronted with the reality of her as a corporate lawyer. But there she was and there we were. We didn’t win this one.” Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Pinterest Next article FBI’s revelations on Hillary e-mail probe leave campaigns scrambling to react Previous article Spending on U.S. Elections Slides for First Time in Recent Political History DigitControl Related Posts US Election November 15th, 2016 Trump will get wake-up call when he takes office - Obama US Election November 15th, 2016 Obama drums up support for Trump News November 14th, 2016 Trump draws sharp rebuke, concerns over Stephen Bannon appointment Leave a Reply Cancel reply BD eXpress Senate intervenes in ASUU strike The Senate Tuesday mandated Senate President, Bukola Saraki, to liaise with the Academic Staff...

Many theories continue to be explored, as criminologists seek the best solutions in reducing types and levels of crime, including theft. Retail theft is a $200 million problem. According to the 28th Annual Retail Theft Survey by Jack Hayes International, 1.2 million shoplifters and dishonest employees were apprehended in 2015 by just 25 large retailers. In many states, shoplifting is charged and punished as a theft or larceny offense – usually as a petty theft or the state’s lowest-level theft offense if the value of the merchandise stolen falls below a certain threshold ($500, for example). Retail theft causes consumers to pay higher prices for goods, and is having a detrimental effect on retailers’ bottom-line profits. When someone is caught stealing, normally police are called, but the response time is usually slow, as shoplifting is considered a minor offense. One theory on how retail theft is being handled comes from entrepreneurs at the Corrective Education Company (CEC), who have created an alternative that benefits both shoplifters and stores. If a participating retail store catches someone stealing merchandise, they give the shoplifter a choice – either the store calls the police, or the shoplifter can agree to sign up for a shoplifting education course that is administered by CEC. According to CEC, the six-hour education course is designed to explain the costs of shoplifting and ensure that offenders will never steal again. The course costs $400 to take, but CEC notes that more 20,000 offenders have already chosen to take the course rather than risk going to jail, and CEC offers scholarships to those who are unable to afford the $400 fee.                         CEC says that less than two percent of shoplifters who complete the CEC educational program reoffend, compared with estimates as high as 80 percent for those who do not participate in a restorative justice program. Darrell Huntsman, CEC founder and CEO says, “Sometimes good people can make bad choices. We believe we are offering a unique option to our clients that provides a more positive alternative to the traditional legal process, benefitting the retailer, the offender and the criminal justice system.” According to the CEC, retail loss prevention professionals like the solution because they can deal with shoplifters more quickly, and it saves time and money. Retailers can connect to the CEC network with a preloaded iPad that allows the signup process to be efficient and safe. The technology allows the store to archive witness statements, video footage, or other evidence to ensure organized reporting. Walmart is currently piloting the solution in about a third of its stores, with plans to expand it, says Mike Lamb, Vice President of Asset Protection for Walmart.  Walmart has typically relied on local law enforcement to deal with crime on company property, but its partnership with CEC is helping to reduce the burden of shoplifting on the criminal justice system and on its loss prevention teams. Walmart executives are hoping the collaboration can help the store earn back some of the $3 billion it loses each year to shoplifting. “We’ve had the program in pilot at a handful of stores since 2014 so we could evaluate results and effectiveness,” Lamb explains. “We have recently expanded the number of participating stores after the initial pilot was shown to be successful in reducing calls to law enforcement while providing first-time offenders a second chance to make better choices for themselves in the future.” Lamb adds that Walmart’s Asset Protection Field Teams go through training sessions with the CEC Restorative Justice Providers. “Our providers utilize mobile technology and communicate to the participants on how the program works through pre-recorded videos so that the communication to each participant is both fair and consistent. We also strive to work closely with local law enforcement because we know their collaboration and support is very important to overall success,” he says. A main goal of the program at Walmart, Lamb says, is to decrease store calls to law enforcement. “The reduction of calls to law enforcement also benefits our associates because they spend less time processing an offender or in court and instead can focus time and efforts on the sales floor.” What are your thoughts on this restorative justice program? Is it an opportunity for shoplifters to get a fresh start and to repair whatever harm they caused through poor behavior? Or is the approach too “soft”?

Pictured is the store at 1401 W. Passyunk Ave. in Philadelphia. Caption(Photo provided) Pretzel options sit out for the Philly Pretzel Factory in the Philadelphia Mills Mall. The company is looking to expand with the possibility of multiple DeKalb locations beginning next spring. By STEPHANIE MARKHAM smarkham @shawmedia.com DeKALB – The Philly Pretzel Factory is looking to set up shop in DeKalb by next spring with the possibility of opening multiple locations. Chief development officer Tom Monaghan said the company is in the process of finding someone to be a local franchise owner, which he hopes will happen in the next three months. “We’re looking for a small business owner to be the ‘pretzel mayor’ of their town,” he said. Monaghan said the person should be community-minded, as part of the company’s operations includes selling its products wholesale to places like schools, hospitals and nursing homes. In addition to traditional soft pretzels and party trays, products include specialty items such as pretzel cheesesteaks, spicy pretzel sausages, pepperoni pretzel melts and pretzel dogs. Pretzel dough is made fresh and hand-twisted, according to the company’s website.  Monaghan said the Philly Pretzel Factory could partner up with the DeKalb Walmart to open an in-store location, as well as open an individual store in the city. “We have 31 in-store locations open already,” he said. “It allows us to take advantage of Walmart’s existing customer base.”  Monaghan said the company foresees being able to support multiple locations in DeKalb based on research into the demographics of the city, but the owner of the local franchise will ultimately decide where to operate. “It costs $150,000 to $200,000 to get an in-store location up and running, and a little more with traditional stores,” he said. “So, it depends on the person.” DeKalb being home to Northern Illinois University is part of the appeal, but the large population of children is also a draw for the company, he said. “We sell our pretzels for fundraisers in the schools, birthday parties, soccer games, in the cafeteria at lunch time,” Monoghan said.  Philly Pretzel Factory was founded in 1998 in Philadelphia by Dan DiZio and Len Lehman and has expanded to more than 150 locations, according to the company’s Facebook page.

(WDRB) -- Wal-Mart's decision to back out of a deal on West Broadway could be costly to some neighbors. The area is surrounded by dozens of smaller businesses, and instead of seeing Wal-Mart as competition, a lot of them were counting on the extra traffic to increase their own bottom line. Tiffanie Lucas is one of them. A few weeks ago, she opened Ms. Tiff's 1 Stop on West Broadway. From snacks to dinner, she has it all. "I cook hot food in here. It is really what sells the best," she said. Business has been a little slow, but Lucas was counting on a big boost when Wal-Mart opened just across the street. "A lot of people don't make their way down here, but if there's a Wal-Mart, you know, you come out of the woodwork for Wal-Mart," Lucas said. "So [it] probably would have brought a lot of people to stop and check us out." On Friday, Wal-Mart pulled the plug on a plan to build a store at 18th and Broadway. City leaders blame it on a lawsuit. "As far as this particular Wal-Mart is concerned, we had no idea that they would back away," Attorney Steve Porter said. Porter filed the lawsuit on behalf of a group opposing the superstore but says his clients had an issue with the makeup of planning commission and design, not Wal-Mart. "We just wanted a legal planning commission, and we wanted the land development code to be followed," Porter said. In fact, Porter believes there were other factors that killed the super store, not the lawsuit. "I think the onus is probably mostly on Wal-Mart," he said. "They probably changed their strategy. That's probably the major reason, actually." Ironically, on Friday afternoon, the Kentucky Court of Appeals dismissed the lawsuit. "I thought it would help grow this community right here a lot," Lucas said. Right now, Lucas is working on a plan B. She believes it will be difficult to top the kind of traffic Wal-Mart would have brought. "It would have brought a lot of foot traffic from people catching the bus, because there are four bus stops right here, from the car traffic, to the employees." The land is owned by the developers, not the city. No one has said what the next move will be now that Wal-Mart is out.

(Photo: CBS8) San Diego Police shoveled out Wal-Mart gift cards between $50 and $100 each for a total of 48 guns handed over in Palm City over the weekend, and garnered some interesting NFA items. Among the haul of 22 handguns, 16 rifles and 10 shotguns were what CBS8 described as “an antique Winchester, a fully automatic rifle, two sawed-off shotguns and two handguns with their serial numbers filed off. ” The video after the jump details one of the shotties– a whippet style bolt-action gun– and shows what looks to be a heavily patina-ed 1892 Winnie as well as some gratuitous shots of the cane gun. While cane guns are not illegal, and the one turned in at the event looked to be an old C&R Remington, they do fall into Title II Any Other Weapon categories and having a modern one without the proper NFA paperwork is kinda frowned up, especially in California.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Oct 31, 2016 at 12:00PM In this segment from the Market Foolery podcast, Mark Reeth and Million Dollar Portfolio's Jason Moser consider the ongoing expansion at Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company is boosting its busy season staff expansion by 20% at a time when brick-and-mortar rivals are either holding their headcounts steady or shrinking them entirely -- a clear demonstration of how well Amazon continues to disrupt the traditional retail world.   A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 13, 2016 Mark Reeth: Let's move on to Amazon. Amazon made headlines today. As the holiday season approaches, a lot of retailers out there will hire seasonal workers. Amazon has announced it's going to add 120,000 seasonal positions this year. That's up from 100,000 last year. That growth rate speaks volumes, I think, to how Amazon has been successful about upsetting status quo with those old school retailers. For instance, you look at Target and Macy's, Target is going to hire 70,000 additional workers in its stores. That's the same as last year. Macy's is going to hire 83,000, that's down from 85,000 last year. Amazon increased its number by 20%. Again, it boggles the mind to think about how much Amazon has disrupted retail, but then you see numbers like this and suddenly it makes a lot of sense. Suddenly, it's all clear. Jason Moser: You know, a little bit more than a year ago, we were talking about the fact that Amazon had surpassed Wal-Mart in market cap. Amazon had become a bigger company by market capitalization than Wal-Mart, which was interesting from a number of different perspectives. One I kind of couldn't get over was the fact that Wal-Mart still does about four times the revenue that Amazon does today. Now, that gap is closing very quickly, but when we were talking about that 14, 15 months ago, all of a sudden Amazon has almost doubled the market cap of Wal-Mart. This is a very good example of that the market is a forward-looking mechanism that we always talk about. The market doesn't care as much about what you've done as it does about what you tell us you're going to do. When we look at Amazon, for example, we know that every holiday season, Jeff Bezos sees that as nothing but pure opportunity. The estimates for Amazon's revenue for this coming holiday are close to $45 billion in sales. Now, that's about 25% up from last year's numbers. That's right in line with when you're growing your sales at that rapid of a clip, particularly considering what Amazon does, you need to have the staff there to be able to fill that void, packing boxes, shipping stuff out, and all of that. I think the benefit that Amazon has here is they've always been very clear from the beginning that they want to be the world's most customer-centric company. That seems like an easy thing to say, but as you know, as I know, I think probably anyone out there that has ever worked in customer service in any capacity, customer service is really hard. I mean, it's really hard because you're working with a unique individual every single time. Their situation is unique to them and you want to try to make it the best experience possible for them. Now Amazon is focused on doing this on grand scale. Now, they know that customers really care about a couple of things: low prices and getting that stuff shipped to them as quickly as possibly. Lucky enough for Amazon, they do both of those things really, really well. That's why they staff up so heavily during the holiday season is because you're going to see I think over the course of the next 10 to 20 years, really ... Again, e-commerce is so young even though it's what we're used to, you think about it, my kids, for example, 10 and 11 years old now, they've never really known a world without e-commerce. I think that ... I like to look at their behavior in a lot of cases and try to sort of see how the investing world may look over the course of the next 10, 20 years and every time I look at them and their behavior, it just screams "buy Amazon, buy Amazon" because they've got a piece of everything, whether it's e-commerce, entertainment, music, cloud computing, and it just keeps on growing. Now, we see they're talking about establishing a little bit more of a physical infrastructure, possible bookstores, and/or convenience stores. It just goes on and on. We go back to talking about how important culture is and leadership and Amazon's success is certainly because of the people that work there, but Jeff Bezos is the man that really has executed on this vision and I think as long as he's around, you've got to really feel pretty good about Amazon's chances.

Many residents are excited for the retail option, and the more than 200 jobs the store will create, while others remain fearful the store will hurt small businesses and offer only low-wages to its workers. Just another chapter for this region, that's how one local historian and journalist summed up the opening of Walmart's new super store in Derby. Development, he says, that started with the Interstate coming through. "Since then there has been a steady flow of businesses setting up here -- and this is just another chapter -- and now the Derby Road, for good or bad, is the commercial center for Orleans County," said Scott Wheeler with Northland Journal. He says there are still people who worry about the box store's impact on local down town stores. "A lot of people look at downtown Newport and wonder what's going to happen to Newport with Walmart," Wheeler said. One person who is convinced Walmart will be good for downtown Newport, is Newport Mayor Paul Monette. He is the new wireless manager at Walmart. "I think it is going to help downtown Newport in reality. I have looked at Littleton and also St. Albans, and I have seen how their downtowns have really thrived after Walmart," Monette said. Monette says he was laid off from his teaching job, so he -- like over 200 other people -- applied at the big box store. "We have hired a little over 250 now -- going for 350. We have had a really big turnout as far as applications, so it has made the hiring process fairly easy," said Tony Lane, a Walmart Manager. Stocking is now underway at the 176-thousand square-foot store. Hundreds of thousands of boxes are being unpacked around the clock, and stacked on shelves until the store opens for one stop shopping. "I think it will be good to just go to one store and get everything you need, and my daughter is working there," said Denise Gandreau, a nearby resident of Beebee Plain. Walmart officials say they have hired 11 assistant managers and two co-managers -- those are salaried positions. Everyone else will be paid by the hour starting at minimum wage -- $9.60. A grand opening is scheduled for November 16th.  Doors open at 7a.m. Related Stories: Wal-Mart groundbreaking marks major milestone in Derby Derby Wal-Mart project receives Act 250 approval Developer files Wal-Mart application in Derby Plans for Derby Walmart move forward Derby Walmart gets greenlight Local NewsMore>> NH police: Vt. man tried to sell marijuana to undercover cops NH police: Vt. man tried to sell marijuana to undercover cops Updated: Tuesday, November 15 2016 11:15 AM EST2016-11-15 16:15:27 GMT Police say a Vermont man has been arrested in New Hampshire after trying to sell marijuana to undercover police officers.

Lehigh Valley Craft Beer: Tastings, new places opening, upcoming events & more LV Business Cycle Retail Organic foods that aren't worth organic prices Morgan QuinnOf GoBankingRates.com Organic foods that aren't worth organic prices Once upon a time, you could only find organic food in health food stores. Now, you can buy organic everywhere, from Wal-Mart to the corner gas station. And while there are many benefits to eating organic foods, the biggest downside is often the cost. According to Consumer Reports, organic foods are 47 percent more expensive than their conventional counterparts. Organic foods are usually pricier because of costs that go into getting certified and maintaining organic farming practices. Not only does it take more time to raise food in this way, but farmers can't cut corners by using pesticides to kill overgrown weeds or control infestations. Moreover, organic foods spoil faster because they aren't treated with waxes or preservatives, so farmers have to absorb greater losses. While some organic produce is safer than its non-organic counterparts, that isn't the case for all your favorite fruits and vegetables. So, before you blow this month's grocery budget, check out these organic foods that aren't worth their organic price tags. FRUITS WITH INEDIBLE PEELS When it comes to fruits with inedible peels - like avocados, oranges, melons, bananas, mangoes, pineapples and kiwis - you don't have to buy organic to indulge. While fruits with soft or edible peels should always be organic, it's generally safe to eat non-organic fruits with inedible peels, because pesticides usually don't get transferred to the fruit inside.

A Trump administration is expected to spend heavily on infrastructure projects and ease many federal regulations. The biggest difference between organic and non-organic avocadoes are the prices: Organic avocados cost about 30 cents more per pound. Additionally, organic cantaloupe is about 50 cents more per pound, and bananas are about 10 cents more. While it's okay to buy the conventional versions of these fruits, you should still wash the peels before cutting into them to avoid transferring potentially harmful residues that can linger on the outside. VEGETABLES WITH THICK SKINS Thick-skinned vegetables like onion, cabbage, sweet corn, eggplant and sweet peas don't necessarily have to be organic to be healthy. Just like fruits with inedible peels, vegetables with thick skins don't absorb as many pesticides. Additionally, people remove many of the "dirty" layers before consuming the produce. Layers of onion and cabbage have to be peeled away before the veggies are cooked and consumed; sweet corn needs to be husked; sweet peas must be shelled; and eggplant has a tough exterior that needs to be cooked down to consume. Carrots even make the list of safe veggies, if you take the time to peel the skins, where pesticide residue can linger. On the other hand, experts advise eating organic versions of vegetables without peels, as well as those with soft exteriors. Many of these foods are listed on the Environmental Working Group's 2016 "Dirty Dozen" list, which includes celery, spinach, sweet bell peppers, cucumbers and cherry tomatoes. Along with being safe to eat, non-organic vegetables with thick skins are significantly cheaper than their organic counterparts. For example, organic sweet corn costs anywhere from 10 percent to 200 percent more than the conventional variety. QUINOA Once a niche ingredient, quinoa has become a popular source of protein. However, you don't need to buy organic quinoa to partake. Because quinoa has a natural coating that tastes bitter to pests, farmers don't need to spray this crop with pesticides. Most quinoa packagers remove the coating during production, but it's wise to give the grain another rinse before you cook it. Non-organic and organic quinoa have the same nutritional profiles; it's actually the color that makes the difference. While red and white quinoa have similar calorie counts, vitamins and minerals, red quinoa is a better source of riboflavin - it has a whopping 15 percent of the daily value per serving, based off a 2,000 calorie diet. The cost of quinoa, organic or not, has skyrocketed in recent years due to limited supply from importers, according to the Washington Post. Currently, Eden Organic red quinoa costs $12.59 a pound, while regular red quinoa from Roland is about $9 a pound. Since this is one of the foods you don't need to buy organic, you can enjoy significant savings - and health benefits. MAPLE SYRUP Organic and regular maple syrup are produced in basically the same way and usually don't require pesticides or fertilizers. Both non-organic and organic maple syrup producers are required to have state licenses and be inspected by the USDA. Currently, a 25-ounce container of organic Crown Maple Syrup costs nearly $38, while the same amount of MacDonald's Maple Syrup is about $16. That's a $22 difference. Because there is little nutritional value in buying organic, maple syrup lovers should consider saving their money. SEAFOOD If you see organic seafood for sale, be wary - there are no federal regulations that make seafood organic. And since organic seafood isn't regulated, that means it might not have been tested for toxicity. Hence, you're paying a pretty penny for a potentially false claim. Labeling farm-raised seafood as wild-caught is an issue that dates back at least a decade. In 2005, the New York Times ran a story revealing that fish sold as wild salmon by several high-end New York City markets was actually farm-raised and selling for as much as $29 a pound, while actual farmed salmon sold for $5 to $12 a pound. The USDA is working to create guidelines that would allow for the sale of certified organic seafood, but that could be a few years away. For now, if you want to eat seafood that's safe for you and your family, look for varieties that are low in mercury, such as salmon, trout and catfish, and focus on buying seafood that's caught using sustainable practices. EGGS Contrary to popular belief, you don't need to buy organic eggs to enjoy food that's free of hormones. Unlike other farm-raised animal products, like dairy, beef and lamb, it's illegal to give hormones to chickens. Experts disagree on whether factory eggs have a higher risk of salmonella contamination than the farm variety. Currently, hens that lay organic eggs must be free range, which means they are not housed in cages and have access to the outdoors. Additionally, they must be fed an organic diet and receive no antibiotics. When it comes to nutritional value, it's actually the hen's diet that matters most - not its organic status. Instead of paying for organic eggs, look for eggs that have high levels of omega-3s, a status that comes from improving a hen's diet and increasing time spent outdoors. Buying conventional eggs will also help you save at the grocery store. Organic eggs run about $6 a dozen, while non-organic options are about $3 a dozen. SPICES Think twice about paying double for those organic spices. One of the world's most expensive spices, saffron is more expensive per ounce than gold. And when it goes organic, the price skyrockets. Compared to regular saffron, which runs about $1,000 per pound, organic saffron costs a budget-busting $3,100 a pound. Since you're not liable to eat a lot of saffron, the risks in eating the non-organic version is minimal. Other common spices are more affordable than saffron, but the organic label will still set you back. Simply Organic Grind to a Salt is about $10 for 5 ounces. Morton salt, meanwhile, costs less than a dollar for 26 ounces. And Simply Organic garlic powder is about $4.75 for just over 3.6 ounces, while McCormick garlic powder is only $3 for just over 3 ounces. Moreover, NPR reported that organic spices can actually be unsafe for consumers. In 2012, a number of large grocery retailers recalled organic celery seed because a batch tested positive for salmonella. It's not uncommon for organic spices to become contaminated with bacteria and insects because, in order to comply with organic standards, they aren't treated with radiation to kill pests. Even if you buy regular spices instead of organic ones, you might spend a pretty penny for just a tiny jar. To save money stocking your spice cabinet, experts recommend grinding spices up yourself.

ClickZ ClickZ Intelligence ClickZ Learn ClickZ Live header-ad-slot November 15, 2016 Search Engine Watch Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Toggle navigation Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Is Amazon the go-to search engine this holiday season? Industry More News SEO 31 Oct 16 | Adam Stetzer Facebook0 Linkedin78 Google+25 Twitter 103 Almost everyone knows that the overwhelming majority (93%) of online experiences begin with a search engine, but when you’re looking to finish off your holiday shopping list, what search engine do you go to? Amazon or Google? In 2012, a Forrester report found that 30% of all online shoppers start research products at Amazon. Wordtracker even went so far as to say that “Amazon has not only topped Google as the number one shopping search engine, but has attracted droves of individual and corporate sellers to its marketplace.” Apparently, not much has changed since that time. A recent study at the start of peak season for ecommerce has revealed that online retailer Amazon has taken a huge lead and become the first place consumers go to find products. The study, run by personalization platform company BloomReach and Survata found that approximately 55% of customers use Amazon before any other site when searching for products online. This was the second annual “State of Amazon” study. While the company’s gains are impressive, it’s nothing short of what consumers and researchers have come to expect from the retail giant. In 2015, Amazon surpassed Wal-Mart as the most valuable retailer in the US, and its numbers only continue to grow. In the past, many more people would first turn to a search engine such as Google, but the number of services that Amazon offers puts the company at a distinct advantage for the coming holiday season. The study BloomReach’s second annual “State of Amazon” study surveyed 2,000 U.S. consumers over the 2016 Labor Day weekend and revealed surprising results. While 55% of consumers reported going to Amazon before any other retailer, search engines and other retailers lost equal ground, pulling in only 28% and 16% of consumers, respectively. The company’s lead has only increased since BloomReach’s inaugural “State of Amazon” study, conducted in 2015. BloomReach conducted a similar study in April, which revealed that Amazon already possessed 53% of consumers’ first product search. As it turns out, Amazon is involved in nearly all online shopping experiences. In fact, approximately 90% of consumers will conduct a search on Amazon even if the product they want is on another retailer’s site. “Amazon continues to be the first destination when consumers want to find a product, driven largely by a perceived superior end-to-end experience,” said Jason Seeba, BloomReach head of marketing. “Online shopping is all about relevance and convenience, and comparison shopping has never been easier – especially with mobile growth.” The retailers Amazon’s grip on the public doesn’t stop at general shopping, either. With the holiday season creeping upon us, the online retailer is expected to be the first destination for almost all online holiday shopping. Approximately 94% of consumers reported plans to complete their holiday shopping on Amazon, as well. While retailers are feeling the pinch of Amazon’s incredibly high consumer numbers, that doesn’t mean they’re entirely knocked out of the game. In fact, a majority of survey respondents said that other retailers were better at tailoring their websites and product recommendations. Roughly one in five respondents reported that quality was their biggest concern while shopping at Amazon. It’s relatively easy to buy some objects, but others face a high rate of counterfeit complaints. In fact, the biggest complaints came from customers who used Amazon’s relatively new “marketplace” feature. In an effort to compete with Etsy, another online retailer, Amazon created a third-party space for consumers to interact in much the same way they do on Etsy. However, the growing artisan community came into Q3 2016 with a strong lead over Amazon’s Marketplace. Wal-Mart Amazon may have some fierce competition online from the Etsy artisan community, but other retailers are struggling with their ecommerce for the holiday season. Wal-Mart in particular is making a big push to expand their online presence as holiday season creeps ever closer. However, investors are still looking for proof that the payoff will be worth all of the time and money in the end. The company stated that it plans to spend approximately $11 billion in its next fiscal year on ecommerce initiatives while still focusing on remodeling its stores. Wal-Mart, while its ecommerce spending might be alarming, isn’t new to this type of investment. In fact, its US online sales are second only to Amazon, the company it’s currently attempting to surpass. As one of the most successful brick-and-mortar franchises in the nation, Wal-Mart certainly doesn’t have anything to fear as far as holiday sales go. The biggest issue for the company is whether its investors will see the current ecommerce spending necessary to compete with Amazon.

In fact, by the time Labor Day rolled around this year, nearly half of American parents had already started their holiday shopping. Retailers like Macy’s and Best Buy have already started their holiday advertising campaigns, even going so far as to deck out their stores in red and white holiday garb. According to data from last year’s Rubicon survey, only 42% of parents had started their holiday shopping by September. This year marks a significant increase in their data, although other studies reveal that Rubicon’s numbers may run a bit high. According to a CreditCards.com report from 2015, only about 14% of American consumers had started thier holiday shopping by September. However, their most recent survey showed the same upward trend in those consumers choosing to shop earlier in the year. American parents are expected to spend approximately $1,711 during the 2016 holidays, according to Rubicon. And as the BloomReach survey suggests, most of them will be headed to search engines and Amazon for their initial searches. According to the BloomReach “State of Amazon” study, when holiday shoppers have an idea of what they want, 59% will start on Amazon and 24% will start on a search engine. However, even a Google search is likely to direct consumers to Amazon before any other retailer. Amazon’s presence in the e-commerce community hasn’t gone unnoticed by consumers, either. In fact, one in five consumers revealed they were concerned about the company’s dominance relative to other retail outlets. In conclusion Amazon, while a powerhouse in the ecommerce community, still has a few issues of its own to work out. For one, its artisan-only Marketplace doesn’t offer the kind of authenticity and service that sites like Etsy do. Consumers are not only concerned with counterfeit products, but with the company’s dominance over the online community. Nevertheless, the company hasn’t pushed search engines or other retailers completely out of the holiday shopping game. A good chunk of consumers still turn to search engines before they conduct an Amazon search, although most search engines direct them to Amazon before other retailers. Holiday shopping season has arrived, and although Amazon has its faults, 53% of consumers still report having left another website in favor of Amazon. This year’s holiday shopping trends just may mark a huge milestone for the company. Want to stay on top of the latest search trends?Get top insights and news from our search experts.

SBUX stock is seeking growth in China's tea market By Dana Blankenhorn, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Oct 31, 2016, 9:26 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: Why Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is a Post-Election Casualty Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Has a New Path to Bigger Profits Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Stock Enters ‘Survivor Mode’ Recent Posts: Selling Home Depot Inc (HD) Stock? That’s Just Silly. Buffett Bails on Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) Stock. Should You? Fight Deflation With United States Steel Corporation (X), AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS) View All Posts Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) growth has slowed. The Seattle-based coffee roaster had been one of the current recovery’s big stars. You could have gotten Starbucks stock for under $10 per share in 2009. If you made that trade on SBUX stock, you’d have had two shares, each worth $60, at the start of 2016, plus a stream of dividends that now yield 1.5%. Source: Adrianna Calvo via Stock Snap But 2016 has been a different story for investors. Starbucks stock is down roughly 11% so far this year. Year-over-year growth is down, and while it is squeezing out more profit on sales, debt levels are rising and traders are finding the price-to-earnings multiple of 30 a bit rich. SBUX has been trying some things — it is rolling out huge stores called “roasteries”, it’s serving beer-and-wine at night, and there’s a “secret menu” of barista-created drinks. But these are not moving the needle. Most stores are too small to handle an extensive line of food. The U.S. market seems saturated and Tim Horton’s is now joining the fray. So as CEO Howard Schultz prepares to announce full-year earnings on Thursday — analysts are hoping for 56 cents per share of earnings for the fourth quarter on sales of $5.69 billion — he is rolling out a new growth story. 7 Fantastic Stocks That No One Talks About It’s in China. SBUX Stock: The Story Is Tea Starbucks is still considered exotic in China. The company has about 2,400 stores there which represent luxury, modernity and American values to Chinese consumers. Now, under Belinda Wong, a former McDonald’s Corproation (NYSE:MCD) executive, SBUX plans to double its store count to 5,000 by 2021. To make the new stores work, Starbucks must become more of a Chinese experience. For that, Wong is betting on tea, a product that originated in China but whose culture has been ailing lately. The Chinese tea market is estimated to be 10 times bigger than its coffee market, but it’s a utilitarian drink, often plain leaves with water from a thermos. Wong plans to infuse fruit flavors in the product, bring in more modern tea-making products and integrate the Teavana brand, which began in Atlanta, into China’s SBUX stores. The idea is to raise tea’s image, justifying a higher price. This is precisely what Starbucks did with coffee in America, where a drink that used to go for less than $1 can now cost over $5. Teavana will be going into all of the company’s 6,200 stores in the Asia-Pacific region with flavored tea-drinks, a variety of tea bags to take home. This includes one drink with both coffee and tea, separated by milk.

Ree Drummond's 'The Mercantile' store opens Monday morning. Ree made a name for herself 11 years ago when she started ‘The Pioneer Woman’ blog. That led a cookbook, then a TV show, a cookware line at Walmart and now The Mercantile. Ree’s new shop, deli and bakery in Downtown Pawhuska. “If someone had told me what would result from my starting a blog, I would have laughed. But that's why life is so fun, man. You just pop popcorn and watch and see what happens,” Ree said. Ree and her husband Ladd, also known as the "Marlboro Man," bought 102-year-old Osage Mercantile building in 2012.  They've spent past fours years rehabilitating the building and letting their plans evolve into what The Mercantile is today -- a general store, deli and bakery. And a true labor of love. When you walk into The Mercantile, or The Merc, as Drummond affectionately calls it, you’re greeted by a smiling face from Drummond's staff and country music, like Willie Nelson, playing over the speakers. “I really want it to be a place where people feel happy and welcome,” she said. The Mercantile is the talk of Pawhuska these days, as excitement builds ahead of Monday’s grand opening. And Drummond has done so much making sure everything is just right, she’s worked herself sick.  “We've had many late nights. Five nights ago this store was just a bunch of stacks of random products and we had no idea what we were gonna do with it, so this is how I lost my voice,” she laughed while pointing at her store. But scratchy voice and all, Drummond and her team got it done and they left no detail unturned. “It's very special to me,” she said. “All of the [stuffed] animals have a bandana around their neck that say Drummond Ranch because they’re all animals that are on Drummond Ranch – coyotes, armadillos, eagles, raccoons.” The newly renovated historic building is a shoppers dream with something for everybody. “I’m a little bit of a middle child. I don’t want people to be bored in my presence,” Drummond said. “I wanted people to walk into the store and say, ‘Oh look at that. Oh wow, look at that.’” She’ll sell one-of-a-kind dishware, houseware, clothing, jewelry, leather bags and ‘cowboy stuff,' you name it. Drummond said she’s been buying merchandise since March. She hand-picked everything in the store. “I had to love it. I had to want it and I basically had to be crazy about it in order for it to be in The Merc and I just basically obsessed over what I was going to put in the store,” Ree said. One of her favorite products, she said, are the finger puppets, specifically the one made to look like Abraham Lincoln. “The products in here, there's such a mix. There are things for kids, there are things for kids-at-heart,” she said. She said the deli and bakery are dearest to her heart, they will serve up some of the Pioneer Woman specialties. “Food is what I love. I’ve obsessed over the food,” Ree said. “I had a lot of fun with this.”  Drummond seems to have fun in everything she does, which is why fans from all over the country want stop in. The city predicts well over 1,500 out-of-towners will visit every day.                  Kay and Jim Graham drove in from Alaska because they follow The Pioneer Woman and her family on TV and online.                  “We love it,” Kay Graham said.  “It's an all-American family living off the land and making the land work. They've just done a marvelous job,” Jim Graham added. Others have come in from California, New York, Connecticut, Florida and Indiana, just to name a few – proof The Merc is already putting Pawhuska on the map.                  “It's a true blessing for our community,” city manager Mike McCartney said. “There's not enough years for me to be able to create what this one business will create for us.” The Pioneer Woman now employs nearly 200 people between The Mercantile and her distribution warehouse in town.  The city manager said it’s hard to predict the true economic impact, but said it will be well into the millions and great enough to turn back the clock on the sleepy, little town. “What's getting ready to happen is gonna bring us back to probably where we were in the 20s when it was really roaring,” McCartney said. The Pioneer Woman won’t take all the credit, she said there are other business owners in town who have the same vision and see Pawhuska’s potential just like her.  “Pawhuska is a little bit of a sleepy town, but I will say, it has changed so much from 10 years ago. There are some young people that have moved here. We've got some shop owners that aren't from Pawhuska, but they saw something special in this town,” she said. “Even apart from what I'm doing, there's a little bit of momentum going on anyway, so it almost seems like the timing is almost preordained.” But as for numbers and how many tourists she’ll bring to town, she’s not focused on that. “I'm bad at math and I don't sit around and say 'We need this many people to do this and this.’ I've been concentrating on making the store as great as it can be and as unique as it can be,” she said. “I think if I get too mired in goals and objectives, I would stop having fun and I think the fun it what this place is all about.” The fun she’s having is in every detail. The rustic charm reflects Drummond's Osage County roots, a part of her she loves sharing with the world. “People who drive in, who have never been to this area say, ‘I just thought Oklahoma was flat and boring and then I drove into Osage County.’ They just can't believe the sweeping views,” she said. But it’s the kindness of the people in town, some of the best you’ll ever find, that will keep folks coming back to Pawhuska she says. “I may be the reason people come to visit, but I won't be the only thing they want to stay and see,” Drummond said. “I feel like people will come and then they'll come back. I want them to come visit, but I want them to come back and bring a friend.” The Pioneer Woman said she plans to be at The Merc as much as she possibly can. The deli is set to open Monday morning at 6 a.m. The shop on the other side will open a few hours later.  The Pioneer Woman is also on Facebook and The Mercantile has its own Facebook page as well.  NewsMore>> Oklahomans Asked To Sign 'Safe Driving Pledge' Oklahomans Asked To Sign 'Safe Driving Pledge' The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority wants drivers to sign a pledge to not text and drive.  More >> The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority wants drivers to sign a pledge to not text and drive. More >> Tulsa Couple Arrested For Felony Child Abuse Tulsa Couple Arrested For Felony Child Abuse Martha Shenefield and Bryan Shenefield.

CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST FORT WORTH, Texas -- Thursday morning's trip to Wal-Mart at the corner of Hulen Street and Oakmont Boulevard didn't end how Samantha Herrera expected. "It was crazy. I'm still shaken up from it," said Herrera. While she and her mother were about to leave the parking lot just after 11 a.m., they noticed an older woman that looked scared. She flagged them down for help. "She said a man had just grabbed her wallet," said Herrera. Mother and daughter started driving around the parking lot looking for the man. Samantha started recording with her cell phone just in case they could catch a picture of him. Turns out, she did more than that. "We saw him by the Wendy's, so we pulled up and I just decided to get him," she said. "I told him, 'You're not getting away, you're not.' This [the victim] is somebody's grandmother." She ended up tackling 60-year-old Bobby Montgomery to the ground and held him there until Fort Worth police arrived on scene to make an arrest. The woman victim told Samantha she was the store to buy dinners for a local Thanksgiving effort to help feed the less fortunate at Saint Andrew Catholic Church. "The lady cop just told me, 'Pound it. Good job.' She doesn't see this often: ladies chasing guys down," said Herrera. Montgomery was booked into jail on a theft charge.  Herrera says she was just glad to help.

(WDRB) -- Plans to bring Walmart to west Louisville are canceled. And some metro council members say it's because of financial racism. "It was financial racism by this city's government who said I'm not going to do anything to help," Kelly Downard, Louisville Metro Council District 16, said. Walmart backed out of store plans on Friday based on various business decisions and extensive delays.  One of those likely being a lawsuit that was filed against the store regarding its layout and design. Councilwoman Mary Woolridge says she invited the people who filed the lawsuit to come to today's press conference, but they didn't show.  "You stopped this project. You've put this project on hold, but what do you have to offer this community ... not a darn thing ... and I am angry," Woolridge said.  Council members say the mayor and his administration could have done more to keep Walmart from leaving.  The store would have created about 300 jobs.  Related Stories:  Walmart backs out of planned west Louisville store Copyright 2016 WDRB Media.

(Robert Short/CBC) Related Stories Multiple commercial tax rates could be coming to Halifax Halifax seeks changes to small business tax bills that pose 'significant hardship' The province introduced legislation Tuesday that would allow Halifax Regional Municipality to have more flexibility in how it determines commercial property taxes, which is welcome news to some people in the city's north end business community. The amendments to the city's charter would allow council to designate tax rates in specified zones. These assessments would be based on a property's assessed value and or the size of its street frontage. 'Structural' problem with city's tax system As the assessment values enter another tier, the tax rate could change, much like income taxes. Andrew Murphy, a chartered accountant located on Gottingen Street in the city's north end, says change is needed to how commercial property taxes are determined in the city. He says there's a "structural" problem with the system that favours properties located in business parks. "I'm paying a multiple per square foot of what Walmart is in Dartmouth Crossing, and I think that that's an unusual result," he said. Murphy says he'd like for commercial property taxes to be based on the size of a property. "Every assessment, every PID (parcel identification) number comes with a calculation of what the land mass is, so it would have been easy to do that and buildings don't change much," he said. Murphy doesn't like basing commercial property taxes on a property's street frontage and says it doesn't make sense that a one-storey building located next to a 10-storey building could pay the same amount in taxes. Skyrocketing commercial taxes The North End Business Association's Patricia Cuttell says commercial tax reform is needed because some property owners have seen their tax bills quadruple in a matter of years thanks to spiking assessments caused by redevelopment in the area. "The ability for small businesses to absorb and pay those increases is very difficult," she said. Bruce Fisher, the city's manager of fiscal and tax policy, says it's tough to develop an appropriate tax rate for all of the commercial sector. He says he's happy that the legislation has been introduced. "We're looking for some flexibility so we can try out different things and see what might help the community," he said. Fisher hopes the city will be able to institute changes that make all commercial property owners better off.

Henry Castaneda, 34, of Santa Ana, was arrested in the parking lot of a Walmart on McFadden Avenue following the chase that began around 10:20 p.m. Police pulled Castaneda over at Dyer Road at the 55 freeway because the Toyota Camry he was driving did not have license plates, Cmdr. Matt Sorenson said. Castaneda refused to show his driver’s license to officers and drove off, police Cpl. Anthony Bertagna said. Police then pursued the Toyota, registered to a relative of Castaneda’s, on the 55 and 5 freeways, and through Santa Ana, Orange and Garden Grove, he said. Besides driving a little fast and refusing to yield to officers, Castaneda seemed to obey all other traffic rules, Sorenson said. Castaneda parked at the Walmart in Santa Ana and was arrested around 10:50 p.m. He initially identified himself as his brother, who officers determined was in jail, Bertagna said. Castaneda was booked into Santa Ana Jail on suspicion of being a parolee at-large, felony evading, driving under the influence of narcotics, driving with a revoked license and impersonation to make others liable, Bertagna said.

My prayers to the family and all those who are grieving – life for this family will never be the dame nor the truck driver involved. The “Daily Journal” and the “New Albany Gazette: both note fog could have played a role in this early morning tragedy while the truck driver of an 18-wheeler attempted to make a left turn into a private drive. My thoughts, right or wrong, the truck driver traveling west on Hwy. 30 may have missed his turn to Walmart DC drive. Possibly to correct his missed drive turned into a private drive with intentions of capturing is proper entrance. In the past there have been a number of truck drivers who failed to enter the proper Walmart DC entrance. Some likely not seeing the sign, “No Truck Entrance,” just east of the proper entrance (many try to enter here as well) and proceeding west to pass the proper entrance. I’ve witnessed 18-wheelers blocking Hwy. 30 West only to stop traffic, introduce the police, wreckers and inconvenience travelers. Would our community be better served with a lighted sign (visible in the dark and fog) at the (“No Truck Entrance”) possibly flashing to catch truckers attention 24-7 noting “Truck Entrance 400 feet ahead” (est.) I think so. Whatever we can do to reduce the potential of accidents to happen we need to  – if we’re aware of a hazard and chose to ignore, are we part of the problem? Just my thoughts put to print. Let us all continue to keep this family in our prayers.

(WISH Photo/Howard Monroe) INDIANAPOLIS (WISH) – The Broad Ripple dog park could win $30,000 for a makeover, but it needs your help. The park now is basically an open field with fence and some trees, but that could all change The contest is being run by Beneful and Walmart. It’s been going on since mid-September. You can vote by posting pictures to Twitter and Instagram, and including the hashtags #BenefulDogPark and #Indianapolis. The two acre park was established in 1999, it was the city’s first dog park. If it wins, it will be the 17 park redone by the contest. The contest has dog owners dreaming of what could be. “It would be amazing if they could take that money and upgrade this a bit. I mean even the water fountain doesn’t work here,” said Janet Buchanan, who uses the park daily. “I do think it would be neat to have little ramps or tunnels or things for them to play on or in run through things like that,” said Eldonna Rees, who was at the park with her beagle. “Obviously, we would still get along without it, but as I said before I think the outreach and the love for the dogs in this city they more than deserve it,” said Ryan Nornberg, while visiting the park. The park here is in a dead heat right now with a dog park in Raleigh, North Carolina. But there are also parks in Georgia, Oklahoma, Texas, Missouri and Wisconsin also in the running Voting ends at midnight. To vote in the contest, click here.

She first saw that her Vizio TV was missing from the living room, and she left immediately. Deputies checked the home for intruders and cleared it. Items also missing included a pair of Apple headphones, a Microsoft Xbox and another person’s Sig-Saur pistol. The headphones’ and pistol’s serial numbers were entered into the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database. The victim said she might have left the front door unlocked. The crime scene deputy couldn’t lift any salvageable latent fingerprints at the scene but did take crime scene photos. This home burglary happened on the 10000 block of Pleasant Ridge Road. Sept. 14 Davies Plantation East (theft from motor vehicle) A man who parked behind the Cracker Barrel restaurant (9649 Davies Plantation East) was a theft victim on Sept. 14. He parked behind the business around 1 p.m. because he was pulling a trailer. The items stolen were a suitcase and a couple of small travel bags with medical items, including a diabetic meter ($200) and multiple prescription medications (Enalapril, Pravastatin, Synthroid, Metformin, Nystop, Omeprazole, Vaniqa cream and several Triciba insulin pens). Also stolen was a Verizon computer pad ($400) and new clothing ($500). The total value of the items taken, including the medication, is about $1,500. The restaurant manager is saving any surveillance video that may be available as there are functional cameras in the area of the incident. Woodland Ash Cove and Woodland Ash Drive (suspicious complaint) An officer responded to a complaint the night of Sept. 14 of a white male in a red shirt and camouflage shorts, stumbling through the area, trying to break the window of a red vehicle. He was sitting in an older model silver Honda and looked extremely intoxicated, one complainant said. The responding officer saw a woman walking away from a Honda Civic. A second man meeting the suspect’s description was sitting in the driver’s seat, and the Civic’s electronics were on. The driver opened the driver’s door when the officer approached. The officer observed that the driver’s actions were very slow, and he appeared to be under the influence of a narcotic or alcohol. He admitted that he smoked marijuana about an hour or two before the officer arrived. The woman returned to get her purse and other items from the passenger compartment of the Civic. The man said it was her car, but she said it was his. The ignition was removed from the car’s steering wheel. The officer found that both the car and the license plate were stolen during two separate incidents. The pair were charged with the car’s theft. The man didn’t pass the standard field sobriety field test, so he was transported for a blood draw. The car was towed. The woman was taken to Jail East, and the man was taken to Shelby County Jail at 201 Poplar. Sept. 17 Canada Road (non-specific other theft) Two people in a large group of about 15 walked out without paying their ticket at Waffle House (3640 Canada Road), as reported on Sept. 17. An officer responded at 4:24 a.m. Others in the group said they didn’t know who the two were. The theft of services came to $22.44. No vehicle information was available because of the large number of cars in the parking lot. Sept. 19 Champions Drive (theft from motor vehicle) A woman reported on Sept. 19 that someone had ransacked her unlocked car and stole a black portable DVD player ($50) from the front passenger area. The theft happened on the 2900 block of Champions Drive between 3 p.m. Sept. 18 and 7:30 a.m. the next morning. She didn’t have any suspect information or serial number for the DVD player immediately available. There was no workable crime scene because she cleaned, wiped down and removed items from inside her vehicle before the deputy arrived. Triumph Circle (impersonation) A woman reported a possible law enforcement impersonator the afternoon of Sept. 19. She said it was around 10 p.m. Sept. 16 when she saw a man in a red SUV that had a flashing white strobe light mounted on its dashboard. She asked him why he had the light, and he told her he was with the SCSO and all deputies have white lights. She said he then changed his story and said he worked at dispatch for the SCSO. He wasn’t on scene at the time of the report, but the officer did obtain his name. Long Bridge Lane (theft from motor vehicle) A man reported Sept. 19 that someone stole his prescription drugs from his Kia Soul sometime between 5 p.m. Sept. 16 and 3 a.m. Sept. 17. He said he may not have locked the vehicle. This happened on the 3100 block of Long Bridge Lane. Sept. 21 U.S. 64 (intimidation) An employee at Davita Dialysis (9160 U.S. 64) reported threatening words from a patient on Sept. 21. She said he because upset because she wasn’t doing what he thought should be done. The woman said he told her, “Just give me back my blood, and when I leave I’m coming back with something.” She took this as a threat, and she feared for her safety. It wasn’t the first time he’s made a threat at the business, she said. Other nurses have had unreported threats, the report noted. The suspect said he didn’t threaten the employee in any way. Deputies noticed that the man seemed to be irrational and emotional. Canada Road (false pretenses/swindle/confidence game) On Sept. 21, a woman reported a swindle that began when she met a man on Facebook. He asked her for money so he could leave African and return to the U.S. She said he sent her a $4,970.60 check to her job on Dec. 21, 2015, for her to deposit and send him the cash. She deposited the check into her SunTrust checking account and withdrew the cash. Then two days later she went to Walmart and sent a moneygram for the full amount to the suspect. Her bank later called and advised that the check she deposited was a bad check. Sept. 22 U.S. 64 and Berryhill (felony weapon law violations) A traffic stop for a silver Mercedes began with an officer noticing the driver’s side brake light was out and pulling the car over. Then while approaching the driver, the officer smelled what seemed to be raw marijuana. The officer wrote the driver a courtesy citation for required lights and was walking back to the vehicle to hand over the citation and when he also spotted a Ruger 9mm handgun on the passenger seat. He told the driver not to reach for the gun and to step out of the car. The driver refused to exit, so other officers made the scene and helped to remove the suspect. A pat-down revealed that the suspect had $1,533 in cash in a front pocket. A vehicle search turned up a digital scale and a green leafy substance in an unlabeled medicine bottle. River City Towing seized the suspect’s vehicle and towed it to the Narcotics lot, and officers seized the cash, handgun and marijuana. The substance in the bottle tested positive as marijuana and had a total gram weight of 17.5 grams. Triumph Circle (intimidation/domestic violence) A mother on the 9300 block of Triumph Circle said her daughter was walking through the apartment complex the previous afternoon when a white male youth harassed her. The daughter wasn’t interested when the youth, about 16 years old, tried to talk to her. So he then began calling her white trash and saying she needs to be drugged and raped, the mother said. The mother also said she wanted a record of the incident to report to the apartment complex. Ace Drive (theft from motor vehicle) A man didn’t notice that someone had stolen his checkbook from his car’s center console until he got notice of two fraudulent checks on his account on Sept. 22. The victim said the last time he saw his checkbook was around 11 p.m. Sept. 16. One check was for $1,000 on Sept. 20, and the other was for $600 on Sept. 21. His bank, First Tennessee, told him the suspect’s name written on the checks that were deposited. Autumnlight Drive (non-specific other theft) A woman on the 9900 block of Autumnlight Drive realized a garden post was missing from her shrubbery on Sept. 22. Her surveillance camera footage showed a female neighbor removing the post. The neighbor later returned with the post. The last time she recalled seeing the post was around 3 p.m. Sept. 18. The victim said she didn’t know why the woman took the post other than for harassment. The responding officer viewed the security footage and observed the suspect removing the garden post. Wood Green Road (simple assault/domestic violence) A mother captured video of a father-son conflict that turned violent on Sept. 22. Officers responded to a fight at the home on the 9700 block of Wood Green Road at 6:30 p.m. The father said his son took his phone, refused to give it back, began taunting him, and then assaulted him when he tried to retrieve his phone. He said his son choked him with one hand, but the father also said he didn’t lose consciousness and he was standing at that point in the attack. The son reportedly also knocked his father onto the staircase and ripped his shirt in half. After the assault, the son broke items in the home but then fled on foot. Responding officers saw no visible bruises to the father’s neck, but he did have small abrasions on his shoulder and back. An officer took crime scene photos. Sept. 23 Glen Birnie Lane (theft from motor vehicle) A man on the 9300 block of Glen Birnie Lane reported on Sept. 23 that his wallet was missing from his vehicle. He noticed the theft around 5 a.m. the previous day and said it must have happened some time since about 4 p.m. Sept. 21. The wallet contained two First Tennessee debit cards, one Triumph card and a Capital One credit card that have now been deactivated. He said he spoke with the manager at the Circle K on U.S. 64 earlier on Sept. 23 because one of his cards was used at a gas pump there. The manager said there are no operable security cameras at that location. Memphis Arlington Road (non-residential burglary) A couple said someone burglarized their workshop on the rear of property on the 10200 block of Memphis Arlington Road. They said it happened sometime between 5 p.m. Sept. 20 and around 11:15 a.m. Sept. 23. When they returned, they noticed the window in the workshop door was broken. The only item stolen was a DeWalt ladder ($280-$340). The responding officer noticed that a window of the shop was also broken and had been covered with plywood. The officer couldn’t lift any fingerprints at the scene but did take crime scene photos. The victims said it was their shop’s second break-in within a week. The responding officer wasn’t able to pull up the report from the first burglary while at the scene. Sept. 24 Salem Woods Drive (false pretenses/swindle/confidence game) Someone contacted a Lakeland woman via her Facebook account and cell phone, notifying her that she had won about $300,000, she reported on Sept. 24. The suspect had most of her own personal information, including her old and current address and several personal phone numbers. The messages also said the victim’s aunt in Ohio won the same type of grant, but the aunt said she didn’t know anything about that. The victim said she thinks the suspect may be using her personal information in unlawful ways without her authorization. E. Davies Plantation Road (non-specific other theft) A paintball player reported that someone stole one of his paintball guns and a muzzle while he was on the 9600 block of E. Davies Plantation Road. He put both items in a black case and placed it on a picnic table while he was playing paintball. When he returned, the case was still there but the gun and muzzle were gone. There were no witnesses. It happened between 1:30 p.m. and about 4:30 p.m. on Sept. 24. Sept. 25 Beowolf Glade Cove (motor vehicle theft/motorcycle) Someone stole an all-terrain vehicle from the bed of a man’s truck overnight on the 3100 block of Beowolf Glade Cove, the victim reported Sept. 25. The man said he parked his gray 2011 Chevrolet Silverado in his driveway around 9:30 p.m. with his red Honda Rancher ATV in the truck bed. He heard a noise outside around 7:30 a.m. and saw that his ATV was gone. He also said his neighbor saw a white pickup with a trailer, following an ATV that was headed toward Berryhill Road. A dispatcher entered the Atv’s information into the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database. Triumph Circle (theft from motor vehicle) A woman locked her car, a Lincoln MKZ, at home around 12:25 a.m. Sept. 25. When she went back to her car around 9 a.m., she found it unlocked and ransacked. Items stolen included her Smok Vape ($120), a pair of Ray-Ban sunglasses ($150) and a 5th generation Apple iPod ($200). She didn’t have serial numbers for the items or any suspect information. A crime scene tech took photos and lifted partial prints from the front passenger side’s door frame. The responding officers didn’t observe any damaged areas where entry into the car might have occurred. U.S. 64 (misdemeanor shoplifting) A manager at Sprouts Farmer’s Market (9059 U.S. 64) said someone who claimed to be a Memphis fireman had stolen meat and returned it for a cash refund on Sept. 25, saying the meat was dirty. She provided the responding officer with the man’s Tennessee driver’s license number and name. On advice from her corporate office, she refunded him the $114.78 rather than receive a customer complaint. Afterward, she reviewed video surveillance and found evidence of the man taking the meat without paying for it. She also said a similar situation happened the previous week with a customer similar in description. U.S. 64 (business robbery) Back Yard Burgers (9000 U.S. 64) was the scene of an armed robbery on Sept. 25. An employee said he opened the door to take the trash out about 9:55 p.m., and that’s when two men wearing camouflaged ski masks and flashing black handguns pushed him inside the restaurant. One of the two suspects made three victims lie down in the front area of the store, pointed his gun at their heads and racked it. The other suspect forced a fourth employee to the back to open the safe. He held a gun to the back of her head and racked it while she was putting money from the safe into his backpack. Then he took her to the freezer and patted her down, searching for more money. She said she sounded the panic alarm in the freezer after he left her in there. She said the robbers took the cash drops from two registers, but she didn’t know the total amount taken. A witness said she saw two men running from the back door to the area behind Dunkin’ Donuts next door. Sept. 26 Triumph Circle (theft from motor vehicle) A driver who left his Chevrolet Impala unlocked in front of his apartment on the 9300 block of Triumph Circle was the victim of theft on Sept. 26. Items stolen included his Oakley sunglasses, firefighter badge, Apple iPhone, Adderall, Sony controller and Nike shoes. He was unable to provide any serial numbers for the items taken.

 The wife of the Orlando nightclub shooter speaks publicly for the first time since the massacre Natasha Bertrand Nov. 1, 2016, 3:25 PM 12,153 facebook linkedin twitter email print A screenshot from Noor Salman's Facebook page, which has since been deleted. Screenshot/Social Media Noor Salman, the wife of the man who carried out the deadliest mass shooting in US history, has broken her silence since the June 12 massacre that left 49 people dead and dozens wounded. Salman told The New York Times in the presence of her lawyer that she wasn't aware of Omar Mateen's plans to attack the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. "I was unaware of everything," she said. "I don't condone what he has done. I am very sorry for what has happened. He has hurt a lot of people." The interview Salman gave to The Times differs from the story she told the FBI as they questioned her in the hours after the attack. Prosecutors are still deciding whether to bring charges because of her initial story that she was with her husband when he went to buy ammunition and a holster the night before. Salman, a Palestinian-American who grew up in Rodeo, California, told The Times that Mateen was physically and emotionally abusive, often hitting her and calling her the Afghan word for "slut." A nurse who has researched domestic violence and who evaluated Salman's case after the attack told The Times "she would be totally oblivious to clues that he is getting radicalized or planning anything." Mateen, a US citizen born in New York to Afghan immigrants, was living in Fort Pierce, Florida, with Salman when he rented a car and drove to Orlando to carry out the attack. He was armed with an assault-style rifle and a handgun that he had legally bought days before. A photo of Omar Mateen taken from his MySpace page. Screenshot/MySpace He was a security guard and had a Florida firearms license that allowed him to carry concealed weapons, which is why, Salman told The Times, she didn't find it suspicious when he bought ammunition with her one day at a Walmart. "It's possible she didn't know because he was not confiding in her, but she does have every incentive in the world to retell this story as a different kind of victim," Mia Bloom, a Georgia State University professor who has studied the role of women and children in terrorist groups, told the outlet. Mateen was the subject of FBI investigations in 2013 and 2014 — the first after he made inflammatory and contradictory statements about terrorism that raised concern with his coworkers, and the second after a source close to the FBI indicated that he may have had ties to an American suicide bomber who prayed at his mosque in Fort Pierce. Performers and regulars at Pulse told media outlets in the days after the attack that Mateen was familiar with the club and had been going there at least once or twice a month for the last three years. He was also said to have used several gay dating apps. Salman, for her part, said she wants "people to know that I am human." "I am a mother," she said. Noor said Mateen gave her $1,000 the day before the attack for her and their 3-year-old son to go to California, and then didn't come home for dinner. Law enforcement sources said in the days after the attack that Mateen had gone further than that, adding Salman to his life insurance policy and giving her access to his bank accounts. Those reports have not been confirmed. Officials have said Mateen frequented Disney World, visiting the theme park several times between June 1 and June 6, which coincided with the park's weeklong Gay Days 2016 celebrations. Satellite data from his cellphone showed that he visited Disney Springs, a shopping mall connected to Disney World, hours before attacking Pulse. Salman, who deleted her social media accounts shortly after the shooting and has since avoided the press, corroborated some preliminary reports in her interview with The Times. She confirmed that she and Mateen had met online on a dating site called Arab Lounge. She also said that the final text she received from Mateen — just before he was killed in a shootout with Orlando police inside the nightclub — was a question: Had she seen the news? Salman told The Times she replied that she had not. Mateen then told her he loved her, she said, and that was the last she heard from him. The shooting at the gay nightclub was the deadliest shooting in US history, with more fatalities than the mass shooting at Virginia Tech in 2007 and the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012.

By Patrick Catanzariti October 31, 2016 Virtual reality (VR) is a bit of a hot topic at the moment! I spend a lot of time putting together a weekly newsletter all about emerging tech news like virtual reality, talking about VR at events, showing people the possibilities of VR, teaching people to build VR experiences and more. There are a lot of VR thoughts flooding this brain of mine! Throughout all that, I’ve come across plenty of virtual reality headsets and thought I’d share something that not a lot of people out there realize — there are many more VR headsets out there than you think… and even more on the way! Here’s a look at my favorites, starting with the more commonly known ones! Oculus Rift The Oculus Rift Consumer Edition headset The Oculus Rift is the VR headset that started the whole VR trend once again! Even this headset has been around for longer than a lot of people realize. It has had several developer iterations, including the Oculus Rift Development Kit 1 (DK1) released in 2013 for their Kickstarter backers and the higher resolution Oculus Rift Development Kit 2 (DK2) released in 2014, before finally releasing the Oculus Rift Consumer Edition in 2016 to many eager VR adopters around the world. There were other unreleased prototypes of the Rift in between as well, but to keep things simple, we’ll stick with the ones released to developers! The Rift itself works by being connected to a PC. It currently no longer supports Mac OS. To be honest, I don’t think any of the VR headsets that will be mentioned in this article work with Mac OS. VR apps can be installed via the Oculus Store. What’s the Rift capable of in comparison to other headsets? Here’s a simplified list of features which I’ll use across all currently available headsets I mention in this piece: Resolution: 1080×1200 for each eye. Field of view: 110° Display tech: One OLED screen for each eye. Refresh rate: 90 Hz Headphones: Integrated into the headset. Seated/standing or room-scale: Most experiences are seated or standing. Extra sensors can be purchased soon (announced in October 2016) that will allow for the ability to walk around a space, however I’m not sure how many Rift games have been built for that. Largely, Oculus have been focused on VR experiences you can have standing/sitting in one place. Controllers: Oculus Touch handheld controllers available to order since October 2016. HTC Vive The HTC Vive headset with its Lighthouse sensors and controllers The HTC Vive isn’t quite as well known outside of the tech and gaming community but it’s growing in momentum that is well deserved! The Vive is a partnership between HTC and Valve, which was officially revealed in March 2015. My favorite thing about the Vive is that it comes with “Lighthouse sensors” to allow you to walk around an area of a maximum of 15×15 feet. This ability to walk around is known as “room-scale”. It also comes with two handheld controllers. Because of this, a large amount of the Vive VR apps and games out there work wonderfully with full immersion — you can walk around an experience, look at it from different angles and interact with it using both hand controllers. One of my favorite VR applications, Tilt Brush, lets you draw in 3D space. You can literally draw an environment around you, look at it from all angles and (with one of the latest updates) have it react to music! It is fantastic. Just like the Rift, the Vive works by being connected to a PC. HTC Vive games and VR experiences can be purchased from Steam or the Vive’s own store called Viveport. Steam’s VR experiences can also be played on other VR headsets, depending on the app’s requirements (if it requires Vive controllers, for example, then the app won’t likely be compatible). Resolution: 1080×1200 for each eye. Field of view: 110° Display tech: One OLED screen for each eye. Refresh rate: 90 Hz Headphones: Requires external headphones to be plugged in. Seated/standing or room-scale: The Vive is known especially for its room-scale capabilities! Controllers: The Vive comes with two handheld controllers. Sony PlayStation VR The PlayStation VR headset with Move Controllers and the PlayStation Camera Many people out there don’t know this is coming, but by Christmas, virtual reality is going to be in a lot of homes around the world. It works by connecting up to the PlayStation 4 and has its own slightly less advanced controllers. It is priced cheaper than the above two headsets but isn’t quite as fully featured. From the sounds of it though, the games on their way for this platform just might make up for its slightly less impressive specs. Sony has a lot of partners in the game development industry. Upcoming titles like Batman: Arkham VR and Resident Evil 7 in VR sound like they’ll be a lot of fun! Each game will have a different level of VR compatibility, different controller requirements… etc, which will be listed on each game box. Resolution: 960×1080 for each eye. Field of view: 100° Display tech: One OLED screen split in two for each eye. Refresh rate: Can switch between 120Hz and 90 Hz. Headphones: Requires external headphones to be plugged in. Seated/standing or room-scale: Sony recommends people sit for the majority of their VR experience. There is no capability for walking around like the room-scale of the Vive. Controllers: Games may use the typical PlayStation controllers, or you can purchase one or two PlayStation Move controllers separately. They also come in a bundle with the headset. A “PS Aim Controller” is also on the way for first-person shooting games. Google Cardboard The latest Google Cardboard headset The Google Cardboard headset is a portable headset that originally was indeed made of cardboard! Of all the VR headsets, this is the one most people who I’ve come across have tried. Rather than the headset itself doing very much, it is a container for a smartphone that runs the applications. Each VR application displays two images, one for each eye, in a splitscreen view. Those views are looked at through lenses in the Cardboard headset. These are the cheapest and easiest way to try out VR as they originally cost around $20 and can now be even cheaper! There are plenty of stores out there who have been selling relatively inexpensive Google Cardboard-compatible headsets including Aldi, Lincraft, Tesco, Walmart and Costco. This list alone could have been three times as long if I included every Google Cardboard-style headset out there today! Google Cardboard apps can be found in the Google Play store, and WebVR experiences (VR running in the smartphone browser) also are quite easy to try out on the Google Cardboard. Resolution: Depends on the smartphone you have! Field of view: 90° Headphones: Requires external headphones to be plugged in or for the phone’s volume to be turned up. Some Cardboard style headsets provide an opening to reach the headphone jack on a phone, many do not though. Seated/standing or room-scale: Seated or standing, there’s no way to move around though! Controllers: Some have a button on the side that can trigger actions, however, this has been phased out on later Google Cardboard headsets. Google Daydream View The Google Daydream View headset The Google Daydream View is Google’s successor to the Google Cardboard headset and only works with newer Daydream-compatible smartphones. Daydream is a platform for VR that will be built into Android 7.1. Google tells smartphone manufacturers what software and hardware needs to be on the phone for it to be compatible. The Daydream VR headsets will be available later this month (November 2016 for those reading this a few months into the future!). Other manufacturers can make their own Daydream-compatible headsets too, however, the “Daydream View” headset is the first official one from Google and is made out of a lightweight cloth material that I’ve heard is one of the most comfortable materials any VR headset has ever been made out of. Resolution: Depends on the smartphone you have! Field of view: Details don’t appear to have been released yet. Headphones: Requires external headphones to be plugged in. Pictures of the headset look to have the headphone jack available for people to do so. Seated/standing or room-scale: Same as the Cardboard at the moment. Controllers: The Daydream View headset comes with a single wireless controller that should be standard in design across all Daydream headsets. Samsung Gear VR The second Consumer Edition Gear VR headset The Gear VR headset is a partnership between Samsung and Oculus to make a mobile VR headset that works similar to the Google Cardboard headset, however the Gear VR headset also provides additional tracking of the headset’s position, allowing it to be more accurate than a smartphone can be on its own. There have been a range of versions of this headset too — two “Innovator Edition” headsets and two “Consumer Edition” headsets. The headsets only work with specific Samsung smartphones. The first “Innovator Edition” one in 2014 was only compatible with the Samsung Galaxy Note 4. The more recent “Consumer Edition” headsets are compatible with the S6, S6 edge, Note 5, S7, and S7 edge. With the safety concerns of the Note 7, the Gear VR disables the use of this phone in the headset. If you still own one a Note 7 though… you really should return it. The Gear VR has had a good level of success in getting quality VR applications onto its platform. Many live streaming VR events have been exclusive to Gear VR. It has also been distributed to many households, as many people received one for free when purchasing a Samsung smartphone. Resolution: 1280×1440 for each eye. Field of view: Earlier versions had 96° field of view, the latest 2016 model has a 101° field of view. Headphones: Requires external headphones to be plugged in. Seated/standing or room-scale: Same as the Cardboard at the moment. Controllers: It provides buttons on the side of the headset itself. OSVR The Razer OSVR HDK 2 OSVR stands for Open-Source Virtual Reality, and it is just that! It is an attempt to create “a universal open source VR ecosystem for technologies across different brands and companies” and was co-founded by Sensics and Razer. Their aim is to get VR to be the same sort of open ecosystem as the PC ecosystem, where you can plug and play a range of different headsets and controllers… etc. Its first headset (the HDK 1) was released in 2015 with its latest headset (the HDK 2) released this year (2016). In terms of the latest HDK 2, here’s what it’s capable of: Resolution: 1200×1080 for each eye. Field of view: 100° Display tech: One OLED screen split in two for each eye. Refresh rate: 90 Hz Headphones: Requires external headphones to be plugged in. Seated/standing or room-scale: Seated/standing only. Controllers: No controllers as of yet. Mattel View-Master The First View-Master VR headset This is a Google Cardboard-based headset, but I have listed it separately as it is already a product available for purchase in stores today and has its own ecosystem of VR experiences! Children already have these headsets and are surely eager for more content. VR developers — there’s an opportunity there! Resolution: Depends on the smartphone you have! Field of view: 90° (same as Cardboard) Headphones: Headphones don’t fit in the current version but an upcoming version may have access to the headphone jack. Seated/standing or room-scale: Seated or standing, there’s no way to move around, just like with Cardboard. Controllers: The View-Master has a button on the side which is actually quite reliable. Pico Neo The Pico Neo headset The Pico is a bit of a hybrid between Oculus and Google Cardboard. The headset contains a chip that is shared by smartphones and runs Android 6.0, so rather than putting a smartphone into it, the headset has processing power that is similar to a smartphone. It can work untethered to a PC but can also connect to a PC for more experiences. Resolution: 1200×1080 for each eye. Field of view: 102° Display tech: One AMOLED screen for each eye. Refresh rate: 90 Hz Headphones: It has a headphone jack for you to plug in your own headphones. Controllers: A D-Pad style controller can be used and it also has controllers available that look very much like the PlayStation Move controllers, along with a PlayStation camera-style set up. Dlodlo The Dlodlo V1 Headset The rather strangely named VR company in China is definitely not one that most VR enthusiasts have even heard of! Their Dlodlo Glass H1 headset (I’m told it is pronounced “dodo”) was very much like a Gear VR, requiring a smartphone but including sensors to improve tracking within the headset. The Dlodlo V1 however, is much more fascinating in its design. It looks like a slightly chunky pair of sunglasses (it is 16mm thick) and weighs only 88g. In order to run it, you can connect it to a PC via a cable or via a smartphone. From what I’ve heard, there can be a lot of light that seeps into your view with these (which is understandable but isn’t ideal for VR) and that the glasses aren’t quite as stable on your head (as they aren’t strapped around your face). Even still, the advantages could outweigh the downsides, as you do end up with a relatively portable VR headset! Resolution: 1200×1200 for each eye. Field of view: 105° Display tech: One custom LCD screen for each eye. Refresh rate: 90 Hz Headphones: My guess is that you can plug in your headphones to your smartphone. They also have a pair of wireless headphones mentioned in their Kickstarter. Controllers: No controllers mentioned just yet. However, their FAQ on their Kickstarter page mentions they are “not too far off from releasing gesture recognition and spatial positioning functions to advance the immersive experience of the D1 and V1.” There Are Plenty More Headsets To Come! Sharp Prototype A close up of the Sharp prototype’s display (Photo credit: Geek.com) Sharp has a prototype that has a display of 1920 x 2160 for each eye — above and beyond all existing VR headsets we’ve mentioned! However, that high 4K resolution would require top of the line PC setups to work! HP, Dell, Lenovo, Asus and Acer Have a Partnership With Microsoft Image Source: UploadVR HP, Dell, Lenovo, Asus and Acer are all working on tethered VR headsets for your PC in a partnership with Microsoft that was announced just last week. The most exciting thing about these headsets is that Microsoft has licenced their “inside-out” tracking from the HoloLens to track the headset’s orientation in a space — without needing any external sensors like the Rift and Vive do. Not only that, but the headsets will start at a cheaper price of $299. VaiaVR This is an upcoming endeavour to produce a mobile room-scale VR experience that will be compatible with SteamVR titles — like the Vive but without the cords and Lighthouse sensors. It is still early days but it’s an exciting prototype! According to VRFocus, “Dacuda’s 6-DOF tracker uses the phone’s built-in camera to determine head position and rotation more than 60 times per second”. FOVE The latest FOVE VR headset design This one is coming incredibly soon, with pre-orders opening this week! The FOVE headset is exciting as it contains eye-tracking, which means the headset can tell where your eyes are looking. You could theoretically direct the experience with your gaze. This also allows for a technique called “foveated rendering” which renders higher quality textures and content where you are looking, while keeping the rest lower quality. Snapdragon VR820 Reference Platform The Snapdragon VR820 Reference design Qualcomm creates reference designs for smartphones that other manufacturers use as guides for their own, and in a sign of the times, they also put together a reference design for a VR headset. It also has eye-tracking, just like FOVE and a pair of AMOLED displays at resolutions up to 1440×1440 pixels each. It also has external forward facing cameras to allow simple augmented reality experiences and possibly additional tracking (similar to Microsoft’s concept above). Just as with the HP, Dell, Lenovo, Asus and Acer VR headsets that are on their way with Microsoft’s reference platform, the Snapdragon VR820 reference platform is likely to lead towards a range of smartphone manufacturers also building their own VR headsets. We’ll have plenty of virtual reality headsets very soon! Intel Project Alloy Intel’s Project Alloy headset In August 2016, Intel also announced their own all-in-one virtual reality solution that uses Intel RealSense technology to prevent the need for any other sensors. Their RealSense cameras on the headset may be used to bring your hands into the VR experience and also to prevent you walking into walls or objects around you. The headset itself is a self-contained headset with computing power all on its own, so there’ll be no cords to attach to your PC. It is also a set of technologies that other headset manufacturers may also licence, like the previous two. More from this author Forecasting the Weather with Your Raspberry Pi and Bluemix Front-End Development in an Internet of Things World Conclusion There are an incredible number of virtual reality headsets already out there today, much more than people realise! It isn’t just the well known Google Cardboard, Gear VR, Oculus Rift and HTC Vive! Not only that, but there are even more on the way in the coming months and years. Virtual reality is an area of so much exciting potential, with improved tracking (especially “inside-out” tracking that doesn’t require external sensors!) and eye tracking, which will transform the capabilities of the medium in new ways. If you don’t already have a virtual reality headset, or if you still have yet to try VR at all, you have plenty of options!

(Photo: Jesse Costa/WBUR) It's not easy to compete with buckets of money pouring into Massachusetts to convince the public to lift the cap on charter schools but, as a former teacher who has worked for more than 50 years with children in the nation’s schools, here’s my entry into the debate. 1. SOME CHARTER schools do an excellent job with the students they enroll. Many come up with better test scores than do their public counterparts. It does not mitigate the victories these schools may have achieved to state the clear and simple fact that, on average nationwide, charter schools are not running circles around the public schools that serve the vast majority of children. Some do better. Some do worse. Some have been consistent disappointments. The pattern here in Massachusetts may, for now, appear to be a rare exception to the norm, but as charter schools proliferate, their record seems to be increasingly uneven. "The primary source of funding is a controversial group of New York hedge-fund billionaires that goes under the misleading name of Families for Excellent Schools and which, in turn, receives substantial sums of money from the Walton family billionaires in Arkansas." 2. PARTISANS FOR Question 2 have not been eager to let the public know where their money’s coming from. But we know enough about some major sources of their funds to set off alarm bells for anyone whose political allegiances are even faintly liberal. The primary source of funding is a controversial group of New York hedge-fund billionaires that goes under the misleading name of Families for Excellent Schools and which, in turn, receives substantial sums of money from the Walton family billionaires in Arkansas. In addition, nearly $2 million more has come into the state in individual donations from two members of that family. The Walmart heirs have every right to pour their money into causes they support. But voters also have the right to get some sense of what those causes are. The Waltons have for decades been standard-bearers in attempts to undermine support for public education — which they and their allies have derided as “the public school monopoly” — by breaking up the public system and replacing it with vouchers, a longtime goal of right-wing intellectuals. In recent years they’ve added charter schools to their agenda. Question 2 supporters would like the public to believe that ideology is not at stake in this debate. Thoughtful citizens may find this unconvincing.   3. MASSACHUSETTS WENT through paroxysms of divisiveness on racial issues half a century ago and has for many decades since. We’ve made some progress since those days, but it’s not all behind us. This is why it’s relevant to note that charter schools are significantly more likely than their public counterparts to be profoundly segregated institutions. This is the case, as Gary Orfield of the Civil Rights Project at UCLA has observed, even in cities where black and Hispanic children already undergo a high degree of isolation as a consequence of residential patterns — an excuse the charter schools don’t have, because they’re free to draw their students from all neighborhoods. This pattern is observable in Boston, where 60 percent of the city’s 34 charter schools fall into the category Orfield has defined as “hypersegregation” (90 percent or more black and Hispanic), while only about one third of Boston’s public schools fall into this category. At nine Boston charter schools, less than 1 percent of students are white children. Only two of the city’s 118 public schools achieve this extreme degree of isolation. The racial insulation that typifies most charter schools has clearly not deterred large numbers of black and Hispanic parents from applying to these schools and competing for admissions to the best of them. Some parents may, indeed, subscribe to the belief that children of minorities are more likely to succeed in schools where education can be tailored to meet what are alleged to be uniquely different needs. Ethnically specific schools, however, do create a precedent, and the message is now spreading to white families too. In North Carolina, for example, virtually all-white charter schools have recently been sprouting up and providing an avenue of exit for parents who believe their children, too, deserve the right to go to innovative schools that meet their own unique and different needs. How soon, if ever, this pattern may be seen in Massachusetts is difficult to tell. But voters in this state may view the trend lines with uneasiness. 4. A WHOLLY different question about selectivity in charter school enrollment has come up repeatedly in this state and elsewhere. If a charter school can skew its student population by cherry-picking those whom it enrolls, the outcomes it delivers cannot fairly be compared to those of public schools that serve a nonselective group of children. In Massachusetts, where explicit forms of cherry-picking or exclusionary practices are allegedly prohibited by law, there may seem to be a level playing field in charter school admissions. But one form of selectivity flies beneath the radar. This is the all-decisive element of self-selectivity on the part of parents who, no matter what their economic status, are most likely to command the social skills involved in navigating application processes, learning about deadlines for a lottery, seeking interviews, and handling those interviews effectively. More importantly, they also tend to have the literacy skills and English language fluency to meet the terms of those demanding “contracts” that most charter schools require in order to be sure that parents can provide a back-up education in their home. Their children bring with them the fewest learning problems and the highest level of preparedness and can therefore be expected to do well on their exams and help to elevate the scores on which these schools have built their reputation. Add to this the subtle and inventive methods of “load-shedding” that all too many charter schools employ when students they admit turn out to be resistant learners or pose other problems that were not apparent at the start. Load-shedding in its crudest form — repetitive suspensions leading to expulsion — has been a common practice at certain of the well-known chains of charter schools; but practices as obvious as this aren’t really needed. Instead, a school can simply “counsel out” a problematic child by saying, for example, “We don’t think we can give your little girl the services she needs.’’ Setting up this kind of competition, in which parents with the greatest social capital are encouraged to abandon their most vulnerable neighbors, is rotten social policy. There’s no way a state can regulate this practice and no way to know how frequently this sort of thing takes place. But there is little doubt that selectivity in a variety of forms is an ever-present factor in enabling a number of the nation’s most heavily promoted charter schools to glitter academically in contrast to the public schools that educate the children charter schools don’t want or claim they cannot serve. 5. SENATOR ELIZABETH Warren and Mayor Martin Walsh of Boston have correctly noted that charter schools are draining off enormous sums of money from already-underfunded public schools. But an even greater loss may be the draining-off of parents who no longer have a stake in advocating for the schools from which they’ve chosen to depart. Their advocacy efforts take place in a new and more select domain from that moment on. Who will stand up for the children at the schools they’ve left behind? Slice it any way you want. Argue, as we must, that every family ought to have the right to make whatever choice they like in the interests of their child, no matter what damage it may do to other people’s children. As an individual decision, it’s absolutely human; but setting up this kind of competition, in which parents with the greatest social capital are encouraged to abandon their most vulnerable neighbors, is rotten social policy. What this represents is a state-supported shriveling of civic virtue, a narrowing of moral obligation to the smallest possible parameters. It isn’t good for Massachusetts, and it’s not good for democracy. This commonwealth has been an exemplar of democratic public education ever since the incubation of the common school idea at the midpoint of the 19th century. For all its imperfections and constant need of diligent repair, it remains a vision worth preserving. The privatizing forces from outside of this state have wisely recognized the powerful symbolic victory they’d gain by turning Massachusetts against its own historic legacy. I urge my friends not to let this happen.

Florida Travel Orlando Attractions The Daily Disney As Iger's exit nears, Disney takes quiet approach to succession Iger: How Disney Stays on Top Aug. 5 (Bloomberg)- - Bob Iger, chairman and CEO of Walt Disney Co., comments on the company's earnings and the success of Marvel's "Guardians of the Galaxy." He speaks with Jon Erlichman on "Street Smart." (Source: Bloomberg) Aug. 5 (Bloomberg)- - Bob Iger, chairman and CEO of Walt Disney Co., comments on the company's earnings and the success of Marvel's "Guardians of the Galaxy." He speaks with Jon Erlichman on "Street Smart." (Source: Bloomberg) Christopher Palmeri and Carol Hymowitz(c) 2016, Bloomberg Privacy Policy As Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger's scheduled retirement date looms closer, the entertainment giant's search for his replacement remains low-profile, a departure from the open process it previously employed. It's been seven months since heir apparent Tom Staggs' abrupt departure left Iger without a clear-cut successor. The top executive recruiting firms say they haven't been hired by Disney, and Iger hasn't moved members of his executive team into newer or more prominent roles to audition them for the top spot. The company has said only that there is a process in place that the board is following which will include evaluating internal and external candidates. Disney may try to get even bigger to compete with merged AT&T-Time Warner Daniel Miller With a market capitalization of $150 billion, the Walt Disney Co. is an entertainment behemoth. But the Burbank-based company could soon find itself in an unfamiliar position: dwarfed. If regulators approve AT&T’s  $85.4-billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc., the combined company would be far... With a market capitalization of $150 billion, the Walt Disney Co. is an entertainment behemoth. But the Burbank-based company could soon find itself in an unfamiliar position: dwarfed. If regulators approve AT&T’s  $85.4-billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc., the combined company would be far... (Daniel Miller) While there's still time to conduct a search before Iger's contract ends in June 2018, the quiet nature of the current succession planning stands in sharp contrast to the widely watched, five-year bake-off from which Staggs emerged as the leading contender for the job. That's fueling speculation that the board could request that Iger, 65, stay on longer than his scheduled retirement date, something it has already asked of him twice before. "I don't think anyone -- employee, investor or director -- would be hesitant in granting him a new contract," said Anthony DiClemente, an analyst at Nomura Securities in New York. "That could happen quickly and easily. Why hasn't it happened already? That's a fair question." Iger said on a May conference call with investors that he didn't have any plans to stick around past the current date. "The board is very actively engaged in a succession process, as it has been actually for some time," he said. "It believes that it has ample time to identify a successor under timing circumstances that will be just fine for the company." A spokeswoman for Disney declined to comment further. Disney board members on the governance and nominating committee, including former Starbucks Corp. CEO Orin Smith, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and former Clorox Chairman Robert Matschullat, didn't respond or declined to comment. Typically it takes a big public company six to seven months to complete a search once the board begins to contact and interview prospective candidates, though additional time is required before that, said Peter Crist, chairman of Crist Kolder Associates, a boutique search firm outside Chicago. "We do lots of mapping projects with the company that take months" about the qualities it wants and needs in a new CEO, Crist said. Disney World, SeaWorld tweak procedures to fight ticket fraud Sandra Pedicini Some of Orlando's big theme parks are tweaking the methods they use to fight the black market for stolen and used tickets.

Walt Disney World recently began scanning the fingers of young children at the gates in an effort to identify their tickets and keep them from being reused. Meanwhile, SeaWorld... (Sandra Pedicini) At Wal-Mart Stores, executive recruiter Spencer Stuart began consulting with directors about what the company needed in a new leader and who they should consider about a year before Doug McMillon was named the retailer's CEO in November 2013, according to people familiar with the situation who asked not to be identified because they aren't authorized to talk publicly. The board narrowed its search to two internal candidates, McMillon and former head of U.S. operations Bill Simon, about six months before making its final decision. At Procter & Gamble, directors first started talking about replacing then-CEO Bob MacDonald in July 2012 and then asked A.G. Lafley to return as CEO and chairman in May 2013. Lafley, who'd already served as CEO at P&G from 2000 until 2009, immediately reorganized the company into four businesses, each headed by a president who was considered a contender for the CEO post. One of the four, David Taylor, was named global president of home care and subsequently also took charge of P&G's beauty business. In July 2015, Lafley and P&G's other directors named Taylor the consumer giant's new CEO, concluding the two-year process. Iger himself was promoted in 2005 after a six-month search by the board. The executive, who had led Disney's TV operations and international business and had served as president for five years, was evaluated against external candidates with help from Heidrick & Struggles, directors said at the time. He got the top job only after a high-profile campaign by some shareholders to oust then-CEO Michael Eisner. Former directors in a long-running feud with the company still criticized Iger's selection as hasty, but the board said it had been thorough and careful. Until this year, it looked as if Disney's choice for Iger's successor would be more orderly, with a seasoned executive waiting in the wings in the COO position. Staggs had risen to the No. 2 spot at the company after a five-year period in which he and another senior manager, Jay Rasulo, competed with each other to become Iger's successor, even switching jobs to give Staggs more experience operating a business and Rasulo exposure to the executive suite. Rasulo, then serving as chief financial officer, left the company last year after Staggs's promotion to COO. Staggs's exit, after failing to gain the full backing of Iger and the board, left no other internal candidate with both operational experience and a corporate role. Of the six CEOs since Disney's founding in 1923, only Eisner came from the outside. Eisner, who served from 1984 to 2005, joined the company from Paramount Pictures, where he was president. While the board contemplates who will lead the company after June 2018, Iger remains active in planning how to shape Disney's future. In recent weeks, he considered buying Twitter, but decided to pass, partly because of price and partly because of concern about bullying on the social-media site, people familiar with the matter said last month. At an October event in Boston, Iger said it wasn't enough for the company to own key brands like ABC, ESPN and Pixar. Disney needs to have a direct connection to consumers through mobile devices, he said. "What we're thinking about a lot is what role does technology have in distributing from us to the consumer?" he said. "How must we invest in that?" In its search for Iger's replacement, Disney's board should be casting a wide net, looking for candidates inside and outside the company, particularly ones with high-tech chops, said Paul Winum, a senior partner at the management consulting firm RHR International and co-author of "Inside CEO Succession." "The landscape is changing so rapidly, technology is opening up new distribution platforms, overseas markets will be a huge opportunities," he said. "The leadership skills have changed dramatically just in the last two years." When a CEO succession plan unravels, as it did at Disney, the company usually starts thinking about the next, younger generation of executives inside, giving them bigger and different kinds of experience to prepare them for the top job, said Joseph L. Bower, a Harvard Business School professor who has studied succession planning. Disney hasn't made any major changes recently to suggest it's grooming anyone internally, however. "Disney isn't in trouble and currently has a strong CEO in place," Bower said. "But you don't want someone to come in at the last minute to take over."

Image: FBI Commander X, a Fugitive Homeless Hacker, Has a New Book About Hacking on the Run Written by Patrick McGuire November 1, 2016 // 01:55 PM EST Copy This URL Christopher Doyon—or as he’s known to his 7,000+ Twitter followers, Commander X—is a homeless, fugitive hacker who has been on the run from the US government for more than four years in Canada. While there have been several high-profile cases of Anonymous members being imprisoned, Commander X is an outlier. By all accounts, he was an influential member of the hacktivist collective during its most consequential period, but he has so far escaped the fate of his former comrades. So, as a symbol of his freedom, today X published his first book, Behind the Mask, and it’s the first of its kind in terms of advancing the public record on Anonymous. While we are used to some sporadic voices from the hacktivist collective movement coming forward to the media, they are mostly heard through voice-scrambling filters in short videos announcing Anonymous operations, or from behind bars. X’s book is the antithesis of what we’re used to from Anonymous; it’s personal, both braggadocious and self-deprecating, and through its first-person perspective provides insight into operations of Anonymous that will be completely alien to any non-hacker reader. It’s arguably not smart to write a book like this, given the intense thirst from the FBI to capture Anonymous leaders. But when you’re Commander X, who has given interviews to major publications since escaping prosecution in the US and becoming a fugitive; and who still tweets daily and taunts government agencies by writing messages on his timeline, such as “What will the FBI Cyber Crime Division do when there's no more Internet? Is Walmart hiring any security guards?” and “...if you want pigs to respect your protest, show up armed”; then quite obviously the traditionally-guarded hacker/media relationship has gone out the window. “For those wondering how Anonymous begins a major operation, it usually starts with righteous indignation bordering on group outrage.” Behind the Mask covers a time period between 2008-2012 wherein X joins Anonymous, quickly rises to a position of influence in the decentralized organization, gets the attention of the FBI Cyber Division, and escapes the US on an underground railroad of his own design. (Of course, this is all according to the author.) In X’s words, his initial thoughts on Anonymous were that it was a “crazy ass science fiction cult” where people wore “stupid Guy Fawkes masks.” In fact, he was apparently told to join Anonymous while he was serving as a "Commander" of a small cyber-focused militia called the People’s Liberation Front (PLF), run out of a “dungeon” in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where “every square inch” of the walls were “plastered with concert posters (mostly Grateful Dead), protest fliers… and hand-drawn art, mostly political in nature.” It’s here that X got an order from the “Supreme Commander of the PLF,” a man we know in the book only as Commander Adama, to become an Anonymous member. This is provable insofar as the People’s Liberation Front certainly exists, and Christopher Doyon is a real person. Otherwise, Behind the Mask has to be read with a certain healthy skepticism about the events detailed wherein. Commander X in 2012. Nonetheless, Adama’s intention for X joining Anonymous was allegedly twofold: 1) For the PLF to form an alliance with the group and 2) to launch an offensive against the municipal government of Santa Cruz for its treatment of the homeless—a city where public sleeping is still criminalized. Apparently, Adama wanted revenge for a homeless friend of his living in Santa Cruz, who was found dead under a bridge. X accepted the mission quickly, which provides insight into the mindset of hackers like him. In more than one instance, he makes it clear in Behind the Mask that he and his colleagues were often driven to action by pure and simple anger: “For those wondering how Anonymous begins a major operation, it usually starts with righteous indignation bordering on group outrage.” After accepting the order, we pick up X’s Santa Cruz mission a year in, where he is living in the mountains growing weed, or as he refers to his plants: “the girls... Twenty-six of the most gorgeous sativa/indica mix plants the likes of which you could only grow in the black earth of the Santa Cruz mountains.” It’s here that he is still on a roundabout quest to obtain vengeance for the homeless. And while he did eventually take down the Santa Cruz county website in 2010 as a direct protest for the city’s treatment of its street population, it was a minor defacement. X describes this kind of low-impact DDOS attack as a “smashy-smashy” operation. Despite the relatively inconsequential operation, it was this protest that led to the indictment from which X is still running from today (it carries a maximum 15-year sentence due to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act). X’s relationship with Anonymous at that time led to other notable hacks, including what he describes as the takedown of Mastercard.com by his own keystrokes (“I hit the fire button”), during the infamous Anonymous attack against credit card companies and Paypal after they cut off Wikileaks’ financial lifeline. In what is perhaps the most telling anecdote of X’s life as a hacker on the run, he describes his role in attacking the government of Egypt during the Arab Spring while spending his days in a San Francisco coffee shop called Coffee to the People Cafe: “Another area where my work had an impact was in data collection… I programmed a 'spider'... to crawl servers and harvest specific data. Mine was programmed to collect the fax numbers and E-Mail addresses of every single Egyptian. My spider, which I nick-named 'Hazel' - was not only capable of doing the task - but she could then separate the civilian from the government data. This would eventually allow Anonymous to wage psychological warfare on the Egyptian government while at the same time sending valuable information and encouragement to the Egyptian people… This led to a somewhat comical scene of me having to spend the night sleeping in an alley behind the coffee house so I could stay connected and keep Hazel running.” This intense duality of coordinating and participating in globally influential hacks while sleeping on the street, encapsulates the fascination that journalists and activists alike have had with Commander X for years. That said, Behind the Mask has to be taken with a grain of salt, if for no other reason than the fact it is written by one of the single most prominent evangelists of one of the most divisive, but nonetheless impactful, activist movements of all time. X is never shy to state (and perhaps overstate) Anonymous’s impact; and some of his past claims verge on unbelievable. But what’s verifiable about the exploits X was involved in are historical in and of themselves; many of his colleagues were punished and imprisoned, the financial industry was spooked by Anonymous’s retaliation for Wikileaks, X is a cyber-fugitive, and he is personally emblematic of a new kind of anarchistic activism that can very quickly grab the attention of the world’s strongest governments. For all these reasons, X’s book is a remarkable and personal account of a uniquely bizarre adventure. His account of escaping the US is, alone, worthy of a reader’s attention. According to X, he designed an underground railroad—before he knew he would have to use it himself—of willing Anonymous members or sympathizers who could, at a moment’s notice, deliver a “package” from (as he puts it) one “node” to another in order to transport an American activist out of harm’s way and into Canada. Designing an underground railroad and activating it are of course two different things. And for X, who at the time was living in a camp by California’s San Lorenzo river, deciding to take that voyage was at times “way too ‘spy thriller’” for his own taste. The book unfortunately ends in 2012, with X’s masked appearance at the Hot Docs Film Festival premiere for Brian Kloppenberg’s Anonymous documentary, We Are Legion, in Toronto. As he says, “I arrived at the world premier to play my part wearing my brown Guy Fawkes hoodie, my all access pass around my neck and a real Guy Fawkes Mask on my face.” So by the end of Behind the Mask, we’re left wondering what X has been up to in Canada for the past four years. Incomplete timeline notwithstanding, the book captures a first-hand account of a man who, for better or worse, was at the switchboard during some of Anonymous’s most high-profile hacks, stunts, and protests. And thus, it’s an essential work in framing the impact of this controversial, decentralized, and brash hacktivist network.

Since beginning operation, BFTP/NEP has helped to create 16,986 new jobs for Pennsylvania workers and to retain 23,761 existing jobs, to start 482 new companies, and to develop 1,433 new products and processes.

PolitiFact: Donald Trump, Tim Kaine in Wis. Tom Kertscher , Milwaukee Journal Sentinel 12 p.m. CDT November 1, 2016 Donald Trump (Photo: Journal Sentinel files) The presidential campaigns are in Wisconsin again Tuesday, with visits on the Republican side from Donald Trump and his running mate, Mike Pence, and stops on the Democratic side by Hillary Clinton's running mate, Tim Kaine. Here's a quick fact-checking guide from PolitiFact Wisconsin. Our latest Trump-related fact check was on Bernie Sanders' claim in Madison that Trump’s plan to repeal the estate tax would mean the Walmart Walton family would "get a $53 billion tax break" (Half True). Our most recent Clinton check was on her claim that Paul Ryan still endorses Trump (True.) (Ryan said Tuesday he's already voted for Trump.) We haven't checked Pence, but we checked Kaine once. Kaine said in Milwaukee that the Democratic Party "is the oldest continuous political party in the world" (Mostly True.) PolitiFact National, of course, has extensive Truth-O-Meter files on Trump, Pence, Kaine and Clinton. For a more focused look at the two presidential nominees, check PolitiFact National's review of Trump's top 10 most misleading claims and Clinton’s top 10 most misleading claims.

Today is November 15, 2016 Front Page » November 1, 2016 » Emery County News » Commission approves the tentative 2017 budget Published 14 days ago Commission approves the tentative 2017 budget Print Page Email Page Share Get Reprints By PATSY STODDARD Editor The Emery County Commissioners met for their Oct. 18 meeting. They approved a tentative budget for 2017 which was presented by Clerk/Auditor Brenda Tuttle. In the public comments section of the meeting, Danny Van Wagoner asked that when the commissioners arrive at item number 10 on the agenda, they explain it more fully. This item was for: Discussion and approval of consent and direction to transfer representation to Crook & Taylor Law, LLC. County Attorney Mike Olsen said Crook had updated the county personnel policty for the county. He is an advisor on employment law and administrative law. It is the same agreement put into place previously, the addition is Taylor Law LLC. The commissioners approved this change to the agreement. The commission went into a public hearing regarding the proposed Ordinance which amends Emery County Ordinance No. 8-7-85A regulating county road and right-of-way encroachments. Attorney Olsen explained the previous ordinance was out of date. The new ordinance will update and make the ordinance current. This will regulate county roads and encroachments. If construction is being done and a county road must be used, then the contractor must contact the roads supervisor. Commissioner Paul Cowley said this must be done to protect our county roads. Attorney Olsen said there is a penalty involved and it makes it a criminal offense; misdeameanor for non-compliance. The amended ordinance was approved. The commission entered into another public hearing, this one regarding the proposed action of adding the Huntington Creek Watershed Coordinated Resource Management Plan to the Emery County General Plan. Public Lands Administrator Ray Petersen explained the public lands council had reviewed the Huntington Creek Watershed Coordinated Resource Plan and recommended it be added to the Emery County General Plan. The Muddy and the San Rafael watershed plans were added at an earlier time and the council feels this one should also be included. Planning and zoning administrator Jeff Guymon said the planning and zoning had reviewed it and Mack Huntington recommended it be added to the general plan. Guymon thanked Wayne Urie and Marc Stilson for their work on the watershed plan. Commissioner Cowley said it's a good plan. The commission approved the addition of the Huntington Creek Watershed Coordinated Resource Plan to the Emery County General Plan. Sheriff Greg Funk explained the 2016 Homeland Security Grant Program Articles of Agreement and Obligating Document for Award for the period of Sept. 1, 2016 through June 30, 2019. The amount is $225,494 which will be split between Carbon and Emery counties. Emery County's portion is $109,184.50. There is also $13,000 for training which will be used for joint training with Carbon County. The State of Utah Justice Assistance Grant issued by the Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice will be awarded the county for $4,500. It will be used for printers for the patrol vehicles. Connie Jensen explained the change the status of parcel #01-0168-0005 for Greg Shipp of Green River to active. This parcel was previously a HUD home and tax exempt. Now it has been purchased by Mr. Shipp, and is eligible for taxes. Jensen explained commission approval is needed to change the status from exempt to active. The commission approved this change. Mary Huntington, personnel director explained to the commission the Wellness Clinic to be held Oct. 26-27 in Castle Dale and Oct. 28 in Green River. She said they have been hosting a wellness clinic for eight years and it has been very successful in early detection of health issues. This early detection helps keep insurance costs down when renewal time comes. They have contracted with the Emery Medical Center for this service. The negotiated price is $120. The flu shots and Adacel vaccines will be charged out separately if the employee wants them. There is also a PSA test that can be added for $37 charge. The commission also approved a four hour vacation time incentive to employees participating in the clinic. Huntington Library will apply for a KUED grant. The commission approved a fee waiver for the Department of Workforce Services to host a training for University of Utah students on Dec. 5. The commission approved the Emery County Sheriff's Office to apply for a grant from Wal-Mart for the Shop with a Cop program. This was a ratification because the grant was due last week. Wal-Mart donates $1,000 for the Shop with a Cop each year. The Sheriff's Office matches the grant. Sheriff Funk said the sheriff's office held a fundraiser last year and each school selects a participant for the Shop with a Cop. The commission discussed the reimbursement agreement for proposed solar projects by Onyx Renewables. The items was tabled. Commissioner Ethan Migliori said a few companies have been interested in Emery County for solar projects. Onyx has been the most proactive. The question is if the county should incentivise such a project. Should the county create an agency which could offer incentives to companies; the agency could include the county, school district and would decide if an incentive should be given. These solar companies look for incentives and abatements. The agency would look at projects on an individual basis. Craig Smith was present at the meeting, he is a lawyer who has helped numerous cities with projects. He said it's one of the only ways to get these bigger projects put in which benefit communities. Taxes are deferred sometimes for a period of time for a project. After this time is over then the county will benefit from taxes from these projects. Smith said Green River City has started it's own agency. "It's an economic development tool for counties and cities to help with projects. It helps things to happen that might not happen otherwise. Idaho charges no taxes on solar. Solar projects require areas with a lot of sunlight; access to the power grid and land. Not farmland. A company needs an agreement with Rocky Mountain Power and a purchase agreement. Onyx has already applied to Rocky Mountain Power. You can't get financial help without these agreements," said Smith. Smith said the solar farms don't create a lot of jobs. He doesn't think it competes with coal. It's a small drain on resources and creates a tax base. Jim Fauver from Castle Valley Ranch said they are looking at 3,000 acres on the ranch for a solar farm. This will create six jobs in Emery and tax dollars for the county. Commissioner Migliori thinks solar is great and could be even better if the batteries to store the power were perfected. Fauver said in California a law has been passed which requires 60 percent of their power source be renewable. The county will examine creating an agency and the costs involved. The Castle Dale dike project was put on hold to evaluate the wetlands. Merrial Johansen said a group had been down to review the wetlands and they found one area which may need to be mitigated. The bid for this project was awarded to Perco Rock Company in the October meeting. The Proposals for Event Coordinator were opened. Amanda Leonard and Bailey Thomas presented proposals. They will be passed along to the travel bureau for their review and for interviews. Danny VanWagoner was appointed to the Travel Bureau Board of Directors for the Western side of Emery County. The board will advertise for a Board of Director's Seat for the Western side of Emery County which was recently vacated because of the sale of a business. The funding has been received for the Des Bee Dove Motorized Trail from State Parks project. The project must be complete in two years. The commission approved the agreement between Emery County and Natural Resources Conservation Services to increase technical assistance (TA) funds in the amount of $25,000. This money will be used on the wetlands issue. The commission set the County Fair date for July 28-29. With a possible community day on July 27. Malone Moss was selected as a part time lifeguard working 19 3/4 hours per week. Danielle Farley will receive a 3% wage increase for successful completion of her 6 month orientation period. Ariauna Downard was promoted to a Certified Lifeguard Instructor for successful completion of the Lifeguard Instructor Certification course. Melany Weaver will receive a 3 percent wage increase for successful completion of her 6 month orientation period. Maxine Fielder was hired as the full time, with benefits, Justice Court Clerk I.

Bertram Capital of San Mateo, Calif., has bought a majority stake in Trademark Global LLC, which ships thousands of different products from a 500,000-square-foot warehouse located inside the massive plant, which Ford vacated just over a decade ago. Trademark Global's founders, brothers Dan and Jim Sustar, "will retain significant ownership and roles" in the company, according to a news release announcing the deal. But Blue Point Capital Partners sold its shares. The Cleveland-based private equity firm invested in Trademark Global three years ago, according to a separate news release from Blue Point. Neither release disclose the terms of the deal. Trademark Global employs more than 200 people, according to its website. That's up from 52 in 2007, when the company took over 150,000 square feet in the plant, which is located on the corner of Baumhart Road and West Erie Avenue. From the old Econoline van assembly plant, Trademark Global ships products for Amazon, Walmart, Staples, Lowe's and many other online retailers with household names. It also ships its own product lines. In the news release, Bertram Capital partner Ryan Craig described Trademark Global as "a leader and a pacesetter." "We believe the company's rapid growth and market position are representative of Trademark Global's superior product expertise, differentiated fulfillment capabilities, and entrenched relationships within the e-commerce community," he stated. Dan Sustar spent 10 years working as a weld engineer at the plant before starting the company in 1999. In its early days, the company focused on selling poker-related products. "As we reach an inflection point in our growth, we are excited to partner with Bertram Capital to strengthen our strong market position and continue to aggressively pursue new growth opportunities," he stated in the release. Bertram Capital has more than $850 million in capital under management. The firm focuses on "lower middle market companies" and "commits a wealth of operational and strategic resources to each investment," according to its website. For instance, the release notes that Trademark Global will work with Bertram Labs, the private equity firm's technology team. Jim Sustar noted that Bertram Capital differentiated itself "through its emphasis on growth, their unique Bertram Labs capabilities, enthusiasm for the products, and a clear understanding of our market trends."

The case concerned a client who slipped on a tree nut in a Wal-Mart parking lot.” The arborist explained the life cycle of a tree nut, proving to the jury that it fell from a tree a week before the accident and should’ve been removed from the parking lot during routine cleanups. An articulate, persuasive expert witness with excellent credentials can be the deciding factor in winning a case. “An expert witness can cost anywhere from $200 to $1,000 an hour,” says Chris Hamilton, an attorney at Standly Hamilton in Dallas specializing in civil litigation, personal injury, product liability and medical malpractice. “We also pay for their travel, lodging and other expenses.” Expert witnesses “typically help me prepare for a case, for deposition, discovery and trial,” Hamilton says. “Then I prepare them for the case.” “If you pick a quality witness, they stand up very well to cross-examination,” he says. “The difference between winning or losing a complex case can hinge on the testimony of an expert witness. They’re worth the price.” EXPERTI$E That price, however, can run to six figures. “An expert witness with excellent credentials can cost more than lawyers,” says Ashish Mahendru, a commercial litigator practicing in Houston. Mahendru specializes in breach of contract, partnership and commercial disputes, intellectual property theft and other business-related issues. “A forensic accountant may cost $150,000,” he says. Mahendru advises clients in advance about the costs and the value of an expert witness. He relies on local experts he’s used previously. But he may also search online for an expert with a rare specialty and sometimes asks attorneys who have previously opposed him in court for recommendations. Aside from their testimony in court, expert witnesses may also be called to give depositions and for discovery, according to Turchin. If both plaintiff and defendant parties stipulate, and if a judge permits it, experts may testify in court via Skype or closed-circuit TV. Experts who give opinions in language a layperson can understand are more effective than expert testimony given in medical or technical jargon. “If a case comes down to a battle of the expert witnesses, the expert who relates better to a jury usually wins them over,” Turchin says. “Juries like things simple,” he says.

When consumers began online shopping in 1994, most of them could hardly imagine that offline stores might disappear. Online shopping was a mere subsidiary to offline stores, selling only a few items then. However, the volume of e-commerce has grown explosively over the past 20 years, blurring boundaries between online and offline. A sense of crisis in the retail business is different from the past. Mobile platforms dominate more than 40 percent of e-commerce sales, being the key to online-to-offline (O2O) commerce. Amazon, the world's top e-commerce firm, has twice as many customers than offline No. 1 Walmart which has over 6,000 stores worldwide. In Korea, the sales of online markets between January and August this year hit 42 trillion won ($37 billion), rising 21 percent year-on-year, according to Statistic Korea (KOSTAT). If the current growth rate continues, its sales this year will reach 65 trillion won, about 5 percent of Korea's gross domestic product (GDP) for the year. This figure surpasses Korea On-Line Shopping Association's (KOLSA) early estimate of 60 trillion won. In 2001, the same figure was 3.3 trillion won. On the other hand, the growth of offline retail, conducted at department stores and discount chains, has been slow since 2013. Although saturating offline stores and governmental regulations on retail giants are some of the causes for the slump, a more important reason is the rapid growth of the online market. A virtual reality Nike shop located in Hyundai Department Store, Pangyo. /Courtesy of Hyundai Department Store Retail giants stepping into online To survive this trend, retail giants, the main concern of which are offline stores, began to expand their online platforms, as their offline channels have been left behind by fast growing e-commerce firms, such as Gmarket and Coupang. Korea's largest retailers ― Shinsegae, Hyundai and Lotte ― have been focusing on the O2O business platforms which combine online markets with their existing retail networks. They have adopted the latest technology with their O2O businesses. Shinsegae Department Store released a mobile application "SHOP@" in February, promoting it as a "department store to be enjoyed by the eyes." This application offers a panorama of the department store and shows dressed images of models, as well as photos of products which have been commonly offered by online shopping malls, including its own "SSG.com." Unlike other e-commerce applications, SHOP@ customers can feel like they are in the store, because photos of products are taken as they are displayed at the offline store. More than 400 brands at Shinsegae Department Store are displayed by the application, as Shinsegae employees have taken pictures of the products and directly uploaded them to the application. Hyundai Department Store opened a virtual reality (VR) men's wear store at the Jungdong store, Gyeonggi Province, Oct. 9. Customers can look around the department store and see mannequins dressed in whole outfits by accessing Hyundai's online shopping mall "thehyundai.com" and following the arrows on the screen. If customers want to visit a certain brand shop, they just need to click the door icon and check details of the products at the VR store. Hyundai opened VR stores of Nike and Adidas at its Pangyo store, Gyeonggi Province, on a trial basis in July. The stores offered a full 360-degree view of the offline stores providing simple information of products. Hyundai Department Store plans to offer a 360-degree view of each product and to open a full VR department store by 2019. A Hyundai Department Store official said, "Our department store will provide different experiences, shifting offline stores to online." Lotte Department Store introduced a 3D foot scanner in July. The Swedish-made scanner measures a customer's foot size and analyzes conditions of the customer's foot. Shoemakers can recommend and make the most suitable shoes for the customer. More than 1,800 customers had their feet scanned and over 800 ordered shoes as of September. Once their feet are scanned, customers can use the data at both online and offline stores. "Our department store has a 3D virtual fitting room and foot scanner, as examples of our new omni-channel service which connects online and offline," a Lotte Department Store official said. "We will develop mobile applications for our customers to buy clothes and shoes with their smart phones." Fighting fire with fire Although retail giants are expanding their online platforms, they are also finding ways to attract customers to their offline stores. Those giants are developing offline stores through experience which is hardly achieved in online markets. Heads of retail giants have recently stressed the importance of experience, targeting customers who seek to spend their leisure time shopping. "Shopping malls with experience are the future of offline stores," said Hyundai Department Store CEO Kim Young-tae during the press conference at the opening ceremony of Hyundai City Outlet Dongdaemun in March. "Online shopping malls only display the products, but offline stores enable customers to touch and enjoy the products during their shopping." Shinsegae Group Vice Chairman Chung Yong-jin said, "Customers want to gain both products and value, staying longer at a place where they have a reason to visit," at the opening ceremony of Starfield Hanam in September. Lotte Mart CEO Kim Jong-in emphasized last year that discount chains should provide customers with new lifestyle experience. He said Lotte Mart will find an answer from "a space" which online malls lack. The latest technologies enable customers to experience offline stores without actually being there. Shinsegae Starfield Hanam attracts customers with "VR Fitness" at Sports Monster. Customers can enjoy scientific digitally-based exercises, such as VR fitness and bike-racing, at the recreational space. "Sports Monster and Aqua Field are advanced concept entertainment spaces that Starfield Hanam has been preparing for a long time," a Shinsegae official said. "We expect those spaces to become new attractions, providing our customers with differentiated value through various exercises and experiences which they have never seen." Lotte Department Store introduced the "Smart Shopper" service at its grocery stores at the Bundang store on Oct. 4. Customers can go shopping with barcode scanners and they do not have to push their shopping carts. If they scan items with their "Shopper" scanners, products are automatically added to their virtual cart. Customers can check added products on "Order Viewer" screens installed at several places in the store and can remove unnecessary items at automatic counters. Purchased items can be delivered to their home. Smart Shopper enables customers to check the actual products at offline stores, while resolving inconveniences of carrying them home. Duty free shops aim to provide experiences for customers with technology as well. HDC Shilla Duty Free plans to make an IT converged duty free shop, if its bid to open a new duty free shop will be successful. A state-of-the-art duty free shop with merged reality (MR), artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies is the company's goal. The duty free shop plans to show hologram images, installing media walls and digital signage in the lobby. Examples in other countries Meanwhile, retail giants abroad have already gone through similar changes amid the crisis of offline stores. In 2014, British retailer Tesco unveiled its VR store which enables customers to look around the virtual store and purchase goods from there. The U.S. retailers Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom introduced smart mirrors for virtual dressing last year. The North Face stores in the U.S. have provided extreme VR experiences to attract customers to offline stores. If customers select clothes and wear VR devices, they can virtually wear selected clothes and experience extreme sports, such as jumping off a 128-meter cliff in the Grand Canyon. jaehyuk@ktimes.com 1. 160,000 Koreans in US illegally to face deportation under Trump presidency 2.

Vatican’s order against scattering ashes unlikely to change views on cremation in Spokane By Jonathan Glover jonathang@spokesman.com(509) 459-5013 Twitter Facebook Email Reddit Last Tuesday, Catholics around the world received sobering news from the Vatican: No more storing cremated ashes at home, splitting them up among family members or scattering them in the wild. Instead, the church instructed that ashes should be kept in church or other approved sacred places such as underground in a cemetery or stored in mausoleum crypts. Burials are still preferred, according to new guidelines from the Vatican’s doctrinal office. While the news could seem surprising to some, it’s too early to tell how this will affect Catholics’ thinking on cremation. But according to John Fencik, director of Holy Cross Cemetery, which almost exclusively serves Catholics, most Catholics were already following the rules whether they knew it or not. “We don’t scatter,” he said. “We don’t scatter in gardens. We don’t do ornate jewelry. We don’t scatter in the Spokane River or things like that. People are pretty clearly instructed that it’s something we don’t do.” Compared with non-Catholics, though, it’s easy to see why the Vatican was worried. Julie Adams, general manager of Heritage Funeral Home and Crematory, said more than half of their cremations result in people taking the urns home, whether to scatter them or take a moment to decide what to do next. “The trend is definitely leaning towards scattering, or at least that’s what they indicate to us,” she said. “Unfortunately, there are so many wonderful, beautiful places in the world that are undeveloped or special places for families, and I’ve heard the horror stories: ‘Grandpa loved a certain spot in the woods.’ Lo and behold, in 20 years that spot has become private property, or a Wal-Mart.” In Washington, and more specifically in Spokane County, cremations are more popular than burials. According to data collected by the Washington state Department of Health, 75 percent of deaths in the county resulted in cremation in 2014, compared to only about 22 percent in a burial. In 2000, Spokane County’s cremation rate was about 56 percent. “Washington state has one of the highest cremation rates in the country,” said Barbara Kemmis, executive director of Cremation Association of North America. “In 2014, you were vying with Nevada for the No. 1 spot.” Seth Hinnen, general manager of Community Cremation and Funeral, said, “It’s a kind of a known fact in the cremation business that cemetery property is going by the wayside. More and more Americans are trying to get away from the more expensive side of the cemetery.” Like the general population, Catholics, too, have grown to prefer cremation over burial. In 2015, 62 percent of Catholics said they considered cremation as an option for a friend or family member, according to data from the Cremation Association of North America. Fencik said that while Holy Cross Cemetery has seen fewer Catholic families choosing cremation than the state average of 75 percent, it’s “definitely increasing.” And like non-Catholics, he believes cost plays a large role. When the Catholic Church started allowing cremations in 1963, it was partly because it was not only cheaper, but less of a hassle than a traditional burial. The Vatican’s sudden clamping down on rules is because the church believes the trend of scattering ashes isn’t keeping with the Catholic faith, which preaches the resurrection of the body. On Wednesday, Spokane Catholic Bishop Thomas Daly made an announcement via the Catholic Diocese of Spokane’s website commending the Vatican’s announcement, in which he addressed that very point. “In particular, I am grateful for the ways in which the document addresses erroneous ideas and customs that have arisen regarding the practice of cremation,” the announcement said. “The reality is that burying the body of our loved ones confirms our Christian faith in the resurrection of the body.” Published: Nov. 1, 2016, 6 a.m.  Tags: ashes, Catholicism, cremation, Pope, religion, vatican Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Unlimited Digital Access Print edition home delivery Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

Hubble Contacts raises $7.2 million to deliver disposable lenses direct to consumers Posted Nov 1, 2016 by Lora Kolodny (@lorakolodny) 0 SHARES Next Story Pokémon Go gets a big revenue boost from its special Halloween event At least 30 million people wear contact lenses in the U.S., but somehow, less than one-third of this population wears daily disposable lenses, which are deemed the most hygienic and healthiest option by eye health professionals. A New York City startup called Hubble Contacts, co-founded by Ben Cogan and Jesse Horwitz, wants to make daily disposable lenses the norm here the way they are in most of Europe, Japan and other markets globally. Their newly launched startup promises customers a high quality but more affordable option than what’s available from traditional and online sellers of contact lenses, like Walmart, Walgreens or 1-800-Contacts. Hubble can offer lower prices, in part, because the company controls its own supply chain. It has partnered with a Taiwan-based factory to manufacture a Hubble brand of FDA-approved lenses in fully recyclable, branded packaging. If their business model sounds familiar, that’s because companies like Harry’s, Dollar Shave Club, Julep, NatureBox, and others have succeeded with “direct-to-consumer,” brands and subscription commerce services in several categories by now. In fact, Cogan previously worked for Harry’s (HF Global Inc.), the rapidly growing brand that makes and sells razors and other men’s grooming products on a subscription basis, and at retail. Following in the footsteps of these “vertically integrated ecommerce” startups, Hubble has been able to raise $7.2 million in early stage venture funding to-date (in a seed round and extension). Hubble’s backers include Founders Fund, Greycroft Partners, Wildcat Capital Management, Two River, and two individual angels, Oscar Salazar a co-founder of Uber, and Brian Levy, formerly Bausch and Lomb’s Chief Medical Officer. The deal marks Levy’s first angel investment. The veteran of the eyecare industry said, “There’s more than a subscription service that matters here. There’s a great price point and the know-how that the Hubble executive team has in terms of safety, efficacy and getting word out to wearers of contact lenses. These things would all be hurdles to competitors.” Cogan and Horwitz said they are the only new contact lens brand to launch in more than a decade in this country, and that’s because it’s not easy to outsource manufacturing of contacts the way it is to do so with apparel, snacks or even mattresses. Hubble “members” can buy a monthly supply of lenses for $30, shipped directly to their homes. Customers can use a valid prescription from any source to register and start a Hubble subscription. The startup verifies all prescriptions painstakingly. Hubble is also working to stay in the good graces of the eye care industry. Its site lets visitors book an appointment with a licensed eye doctor nearby, should they need a new prescription. Hubble doesn’t require eye doctors to prescribe their brand of lenses to referred patients. But driving new business to ophthalmologists or optometrists certainly gets their attention, and makes them aware of Hubble’s offering, the cofounders said. Greycroft Partners’ Ellie Wheeler, a Hubble investor, said she expects the company to use its funding for hiring, to get word out about its brand in the U.S., and to make sure every operational detail leads to great customer experiences. She said, “In a lot of categories, you didn’t care about a brand until you did. We’re making a bet that Hubble can create a brand that resonates with consumers. Delivery and convenience are  only part of what they’re offering.” Featured Image: Hubble Contacts 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Hubble Contacts Founded 2016 Overview Hubble is the first brand of contact lenses sold directly to consumers through an e-commerce, subscription-only model.

Microsoft and Apple Top “The Most Loved Brands” Chart in the US GO Digital brands get the highest “Love Index” score Nov 1, 2016 09:31 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  The Love Index, a report created by Fjord and Accenture Interactive, puts Apple and Microsoft on the leading spots of a chart that concerns the most loved brands in the United States. Unsurprisingly, digital brands are topping the charts over traditional ones, mostly because of the devices and services they are offering to the young generation. Apple is currently the leading brand in the United States, followed by Microsoft, Netflix, and Samsung, while Google is only sixth after Sony. The only non-digital brand in the chart is Walmart which comes in on the tenth position. Fjord explains that in order to determine the love index of each brand, the company analyzed a variety of elements, including how fun, relevant, engaging, social, and helpful each brand is. “Google is great on Relevant, but falls short on Fun and Social, while Facebook is great on Social but falls short on Relevant or Engaging. Does this matter? It depends. If another Search Engine came along that focused on being as Relevant as Google, but also more Fun and Social, that might disrupt Google,” the company explained in documentation published in May this year. According to The Drum, Apple managed to steal this year’s number one position thanks to its level of engagement, while Netflix reached the third position for being fun. Amazon improved its score thanks to being helpful and relevant. The survey involved a total of 27,000 people from three large markets, namely the United States, the United Kingdom, and Brazil. The Microsoft brand As far as the Microsoft brand is concerned, the company itself is now trying to improve in this regard, explaining that it’s focusing its efforts on the “utilitarian bend” that the Microsoft name has in the first place. “To me, the Microsoft brand has always stood for being the company that has got a bit of a utilitarian bend to it, which I think is a good one. That’s who we are - we are the company that stands for builders, makers, and creators. That’s the brand that we want,” CEO Satya Nadella said in a recent interview. Apple, on the other hand, relies mostly on the iPhone, the iPad, and the MacBook, while Netflix keeps growing mostly thanks to its expanding services across the world. The digital world is expected to continue dominating this chart in the coming years, with the same companies likely to maintain the leadership as well. #Microsoft#Apple#Netflix#most loved brands subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Microsoft Brings Office on Apple’s New MacBook Touch Bar Microsoft Surface Exec Thinks Apple Will Build a Touchscreen MacBook Microsoft Trashes the New Apple MacBook Pro on Its Official Website Microsoft Launches the Surface Book i7 Apple Insider Says iPhone 6 Plus Has a Major Bug, Company Should Start Recall Hackers Steal FIFA Currency, Buy Houses and Expensive Cars with the Money WhatsApp Announces Video Calling Rolling Out to Android, iOS Users Microsoft Announces Black Friday 2016 Deals: Perfect Time to Go Windows 10 KDE Frameworks 5.28.0 Released with Numerous KWayland Improvements, More NVIDIA Makes Available GeForce Graphics Driver 375.86 - Get It Now Microsoft CEO Meets Chinese Official One Day After Warning on Trump Tax Plan Apple Downplays Microsoft Surface, Says Having Touch on a Desktop Is a Disaster    Apple is leading the charts, followed by Microsoft and Netflix New Apps TBDT: Integrate and display a customizable view of the current date and time in any active window by using this lightweight, useful application TwinkiePaste: Paste commonly used texts with hotkeys from anywhere, which will save you the time spent on typing a phrase or copy and paste it TBDT Portable: Display customizable date and time information in any active window by using this lightweight, portable application that comes with multiple configuration options SmartFTP FTP Library: Integrate FTP and SFTP file transfer capabilities into your software with the help of this advanced FTP library ActiveX component (COM) Mp3tag: Powerful tag editor for various music files, enabling users to change the metadata information of their tracks in batch mode by syncing content with online databases Tresorit: Store, synchronize and share data securely with the help of this application that provides you with quick access to a cloud-based service Clover: Work faster and more efficient by adding tab support to Windows Explorer with the help of this useful and streamlined application Reader comments Russia Starts Microsoft Antivirus Investigation After Kaspersky Complaint more on: Microsoft i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

The European Union has banned or restricted more than 1,000 chemicals; in the U.S., fewer than 50. Consumer demand for safe products has global companies scrambling for greener ingredients, but obstacles are daunting. Suppliers are often reluctant to share their formulations, buyers balk at higher costs, and in some cases cost-effective safer substitutes simply aren’t available. Levi’s has prohibited certain chemicals since 2000, but this is different. The jeans maker and other companies are asking suppliers to use materials generated from bacteria, fungus, yeast and methane gas to replace the petroleum-based substances that make up more than 95 percent of U.S. products’ inventory of chemicals. Millennial Interest There are plenty of incentives to change. A Pike Research report estimates that the global market for green chemistry will increase to almost $100 billion by 2020, from $11 billion last year. Millennials are overwhelmingly interested in sustainable investing, according to Morgan Stanley. And innovating can give companies a competitive advantage, said Monica Becker, co-director of the Green Chemistry and Commerce Council, which works with companies including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Companies can make false promises that a product is consistent with green-chemistry practices, Becker said, but guarding against that are assessment methods used by the Environmental Protection Agency’s Safer Choice program. Rules can also confound the efforts of U.S. companies. To approve chemicals and processes, the European Union uses a so-called hazard-based approach that the Chinese government is also considering. Manufacturers need to prove their products meet safety standards before they bring them to market. The U.S. method is risk-based. It involves weighing metrics, such as quantity and duration of exposure, to assess the danger in an existing product -- if data exist. Tiny Exposure Proponents of a hazard-based approach argue that exposure to even tiny amounts of some chemicals correlate with learning disabilities, asthma, allergies and cancer. “Shouldn’t it be that chemicals are guilty until research proves them innocent?” said Amy Ziff, founder and executive director of Made Safe, a new hazard-based certification program. Levi’s said its goal is to use only chemicals that pass hazard-based screens by 2020. Even as some suppliers push back, “we wouldn’t give up on hazard-based,” said Bart Sights, Levi’s vice president of global development. Levi’s already uses some green methods to make its signature blue jeans. To give them a worn look, Levi’s uses an enzyme derived from fungus and tumbles the jeans in ozone gas instead of bleach -- a process that Sights estimated has had the added benefit of saving the company a billion gallons of water in the past three years. Environmental Compliance “Some companies are spending the same amount on environmental compliance as they are on research and development,” said John Warner, president and chief technology officer of Warner Babcock Institute for Green Chemistry, who created the first green-chemistry Ph.D. program in the U.S., at the University of Massachusetts at Boston.

Lumber Liquidators Holdings Inc. was beset by lawsuits last year after a “60 Minutes” investigation said it used unsafe levels of formaldehyde. Shares plunged before a government probe ended without a product recall. The company no longer sells the flooring. Such problems have investors taking notice, said Mark Rossi, whose company, Clean Production Action, created the Chemical Footprint, modeled on the carbon footprint, that investors can use to measure risk and costs. It also developed and licenses a chemical-screening method used by Levi’s and others. Rossi has signed on firms including BNP Paribas, Calvert Investments and Trillium Asset Management, while companies like Johnson & Johnson and Clorox Co. participated in the first survey to assess their footprint. Gojo Industries Inc., maker of Purell hand sanitizer, has pledged to cut its chemical footprint in half by 2020. Greenpeace Campaign In the five years since it launched a campaign to spur clothing makers and sellers to get rid of toxic substances, Greenpeace International has signed on 78 brands, said Kirsten Brodde, head of the organization’s Detox My Fashion campaign. At the Berkeley Center for Green Chemistry, across the Bay Bridge from Levi’s San Francisco headquarters, students have worked with the jeans maker and companies such as outfitter Patagonia Inc., office-furniture maker Steelcase Inc. and Mango Materials Inc., which manufactures plastics out of methane gas, to develop safer materials, including a non-toxic resin for Autodesk’s 3D printers. Initial Step But an overnight change for the greener just isn’t possible. “When it comes to materials, we’re at the very initial step, which is figuring out what the heck is actually in our products,” said Marty Mulvihill, a founder of the Berkeley Center and its former executive director. “A lot of companies are just completing that first step.” A comprehensive replacement for formaldehyde, for example, hasn’t been developed, Mulvihill said. Mulvihill is now a partner at Safer Made, a new venture-capital firm he co-founded that’s seeking investments in companies that use green chemistry. It’s looked at more than 100 companies, with plans to invest in 10 to 15 firms in the next five years, he said. Patagonia has also invested in green chemical companies. A Levi’s supplier, Beyond Surface Technologies, is one of a dozen the Ventura, California-based clothing maker has seeded out of 1,400 prospects it’s looked at since 2013. “Ultimately, some of these companies that we fund could be able to help us clean up our own supply chain,” said Phil Graves, Patagonia’s director of corporate development. Green Alternatives There are 20 environmentally friendly chemicals available for the company’s textile finishes, compared with 200 to 300 that contain non-green chemicals, said Matthias Foessel, Beyond Surface’s founder and chief executive officer. Developing safer alternatives can take years, while acceptable green substitutes for some substances used in waterproofing and stain protectants, such as perfluorocarbons, don’t exist, Foessel said. New chemicals often behave differently than expected. Beyond Surface had been trying to create a water repellent when it developed a fabric that absorbs sweat instead. Still, Foessel’s eight-year-old firm, based near Basel, Switzerland, now has more than 100 customers, including Adidas AG. “Ten years ago, people wouldn’t have even talked to us,” Foessel said. “People accepted that you had to use chemicals that pose a risk.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Hall Blanco  |  Posted: Mon. October 31, 2016, 12:21pm PTAlso published in Sun-Sentinel (FL) on Mon. October 31, 2016, and InsideSources.com on Fri. October 28, 2016           Print  There are very few things that Democratic and Republican presidential nominees Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump can agree upon. From taxes to immigration to trade deals, the candidates positions are rarely in agreement. One policy that both candidates support, however, is mandated paid maternity leave. Trump proposes to mandate six weeks of paid leave for women who do not receive such a benefit from their employers. Clintons plan would grant 12 weeks of paid leave to new moms. The candidates suggest that their plans would not cost businesses money, claiming their programs would be financed either by eliminating fraud in unemployment insurance (Trump) or having the wealthy pay their fair share (Clinton). What these candidates fail to realize, however, is that their policies, no matter how well-intentioned, would create difficulty for businesses and ultimately harm the very groups the candidates intend to helpwomen and families. Suppose that either the Clinton or Trump plan were enacted and that taxpayers would pay the womens wages. This would not mean that employers would bear no costs. They would still have to pay for medical insurance and cover for the missing employees either by finding someone new (incurring search and training costs, etc.) or pay overtime to existing workers. These costs arent trivial. When even large companies like Walmart operate on a mere 3 percent profit margin, even a slight increase in labor costs can make a big difference. Even with this information, many people would still support such a policy, as it appears to benefit women and families. But, again, this simply isnt the case because in the face of mandated leave, women would be less likely to be hired and those who were hired would earn less than men. Understanding why is a lesson in economics 101. Suppose an employer is looking for a new worker. One candidate is male; the other is female. Both are in their late 20s and have equal qualifications in every respect, or perhaps the female is slightly more qualified. With mandated leave shes less likely to be hired. Why? Because hiring her would be more expensive. Her prospective employer, looking at her age, could reasonably expect her to have a child in the next few years. That means he would have to pay for her insurance while shes on leave and pay someone to cover for her absence. So the employer would hire the man or pay the woman less, not because he hates women or families but because hes trying to run a business. Note that this creates a problem for all younger women in the labor force. Regardless of a particular womans family plans, women as a group would be more expensive to hire. Politicians and others typically point to Nordic countries as icons of maternity policy and as a counterargument to my case against it. Its often noted that these countries are wealthy, have generous paid-leave policies, and are more likely to return to the labor force after having a baby. In Norway, for example, a woman can receive 36 to 46 weeks of paid leave after the birth or adoption of a baby. In Denmark mothers can take off a full year with pay. What these statistics leave out, however, is that women in these countries are much less likely than American women to achieve their career goals. Long leave often weakens individuals professional networks and causes many women to experience what economists call human capital depreciation, which means their skills get rusty. This is bad news when it comes time to ask for a raise or promotion. In contrast, women in the United States are much more likely to earn wages closer to their male counterparts and hold managerial and executive positions. Instead of coercing employers into giving a set amount of leave, how about allowing women and men to engage in contractual alternatives? Lets encourage individuals to negotiate parental leave as they would salary or any other benefits. This would allow for women who intend to have children to obtain time off without harming women as a whole. Its not often that candidates agree on a policy. Unfortunately for women, both candidates are wrong on mandated leave. Abigail R.

He was ultimately arrested in a Walmart parking lot in Santa Ana, police said. Police tried to pull the driver over around 10:20 p.m. at Dyer Road at the 55 freeway because his Toyota did not have license plates and fit the profile for a stolen vehicle, according to Cmdr. Matt Sorenson of the Santa Ana Police Department. Instead of pulling over, the driver led police on a chase on the 55 and 5 freeways, and through Santa Ana, Orange and Garden Grove. “Besides going a little fast, he seemed to be obeying all traffic rules,” Sorenson said. “Except for yielding to police.” At one point, in video captured by KCAL9, the driver stopped at a red light with his left-turn signal flashing; when the light changed, he made the left. The male driver - whose name and age were not yet available - stopped at the Walmart at 3600 W. McFadden Ave. and was arrested around 10:50 p.m., Sorenson said. Investigators were looking into whether the car was indeed stolen, he added.

(ASI), is getting into the holiday spirit early this year and preparing for its annual Titan Toy Drive. The event, which will last the entire month of November, calls upon the generosity of students, faculty and staff members to donate toys and Christmas gifts for underprivileged youth in Orange County. Camp co-director Norman Nguyen said he wants students to dig deep and give wholeheartedly this holiday season. “We really depend on our community to be generous and thoughtful when giving away gifts,” Nguyen said. “We understand that some people don’t have the time to head out to Wal-Mart or Target to get a doll, or truck, or bike.” According to Nguyen, students can make monetary donations as well, as there will be little collection buckets around the shops on campus. The gifts and donations collected during the toy drive will be given to participating children and their families at the Camp Titan Holiday party, which is held on Dec. 3 at the campus pavilion. The annual event provides a chance for former campers, their families and counselors to reunite over food, games and crafts. The camp, which serves roughly 180 children between the ages of six and 14, is held for one week in June in the San Bernardino National forest. Campers participate in a wide variety of activities ranging from astronomy to archery to zip-lining. The children that attend the camp primarily make up those that participate in and attend the holiday gift giving party. This year, Camp Titan has paired up with several organizations on campus including service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega, other social sororities and fraternities, Titan Bowl & Billiards, the staff at the SRC, and volunteers from the ASI street team. “We’re really happy to work with all these organizations,” Nguyen said, “It’s really nice to see how many people in the community come together for this toy drive.” This year, Titan Toy drive sponsors are offering free prizes for students that donate. Bringing an unwrapped toy to Titan Bowl & Billiards will earn one free game of bowling at the TSU, and the SRC is offering the choice of one free boot camp class to students that donate. Donation boxes will be available for toy drop-off in several locations within the newly renovated TSU and on campus between Nov. 1 to Nov. 30. For more information on the Titan Toy Drive or Camp Titan, contact co-directors Helya Kargosha or Norman Nguyen by email at ctitan@fullerton.edu or by phone at 657-278-3036.

Kentucky proposes radioactive waste penalty James Bruggers , @jbruggers 1:23 p.m. EDT October 31, 2016 Citizen group to hold community meeting on Nov. 14 with state officials who have been investigating radioactive waste dumping at a local landfill. Buy Photo Estill County High School is across the road from the Blue Ridge Landfill owned by Advanced Disposal. (Photo: JAMES BRUGGERS/THE COURIER-JOURNAL)Buy Photo The Estill County dump that accepted radioactive waste will install monitors, fund school radon testing and develop a corrective action plan, under a draft agreement the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet. Cabinet officials are inviting the public to comment through Nov. 21 on the agreement, which also carries a $95,000 penalty to be spent by the Blue Ridge Landfill on the school monitoring and other environmental programs. At issue is more than 1,000 cubic yards of radioactive oil and gas drilling waste that state officials say was brought into Kentucky illegally and dumped at the Estill landfill from July through November 2015. State officials traced the waste to fracking operations in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The high-profile case has been seen by some as a test for the Bevin administration. A citizens group has been pressing the state for transparency and full enforcement of environmental and health regulations related to the dumping and is scheduled to hold an informational meeting with state authorities in Estill County on Nov. 14. So far, state environment and health officials have been "responsive to us (and) have embraced our comments and concerns," said Tom Hart, a retired Air Force officer and a spokesman for the group, Concerned Citizens of Estill County. "It's a process. They have agreed there is something that needs to be fixed." ► READ MORE:Which Louisville hospitals made the safety grade? ► READ MORE: Council blasts mayor, foes for Wal-Mart pullout ► READ MORE: Lobbyist donations aid candidates despite law ► READ MORE: Chasing spirits: Ex-cop now hunts the haunted ► READ MORE: Eminent heart surgeon guilty of health fraud ► READ MORE: Get a sneak peek inside new Holiday Manor Kroger ► READ MORE: Folklore Forecasting: What does winter hold? Energy Cabinet Secretary Charles Snavely said his cabinet took the proposed enforcement action "to ensure that the citizens of Estill County and the local government are fully protected, with assurances that this will not happen again." The agreement said the landfill will use radiation monitors at the Estill dump and another landfill it owns in Morehead. The corrective action plan is to be developed after the agreement becomes final and is to demonstrate remedies that protect public health and the environment. "The real meat is going to be in determining what remediation looks like," said Mary Cromer, an attorney with the Appalachian Citizens Law Center, which is working with the Estill residents. The media office of Florida-based Advance Disposal Services, which owns the Estill landfill, did not immediately return a request for comment Monday.  But the draft agreement asserts that the shipments had been certified by a hauler to not be hazardous or radioactive. The agreement also includes language saying followup monitoring at the landfill and nearby schools found no evidence of radiation above state and federal safety limits. Kentucky Attorney General Andy Beshear earlier declined to bring any criminal charges in connection to the matter, saying he lacked evidence. “The Cabinet for Health and Family Services continues to investigate the legal ramifications surrounding this issue," according to a written statement attributed to cabinet spokesman Doug Hogan. The cabinet intends to seek civil penalties against all parties responsible for bringing the materials into Kentucky, the statement said, declining further comment. State officials, working with industry and environmental advocates, are also wrapping up a report to Kentucky lawmakers that may include proposals for new regulations on radioactive drilling waste in Kentucky.

A Chattanooga resident, he has served on True North's board of directors since 2015 and brings three decades of health care leadership experience to the company. "True North Custom is a proven brand with an excellent reputation in the industry and I'm proud to lead an organization that many of the nation's top health care brands trust to guide their marketing and communication strategies," said Hobson in a statement. He has also served as president of the Chattanooga Area Hospital District and chair of the Hospital Alliance of Tennessee. True North Custom partners with more than 500 client organizations nationwide to develop fully custom and data-driven content marketing strategies that support growth, retention, and cost-containment. Bullet train study picks 3 corridors A draft study by the Georgia Department of Transporation offers three corridors to connect Chattanooga and Atlanta by high-speed rail. The three include a route that runs along Interstate 75, another that runs parallel to U.S. Highway 411 though much of Northwest Georgia, and a third that goes through Rome, Ga. A public hearing on the study is slated for Nov. 16 from 6-8 p.m. at the Chattanooga-Hamilton County Regional Planning Agency in the Development Resource Center on Market Street. Rapid rail has been under study for nearly two decades, and Chattanooga Mayor Andy Berke said last year that while the idea might be neat, he doubts there is money or political will to build it. "Any kind of intercity rail doesn't happen without large-scale federal investment," Berke said last year. "It's pretty clear that the federal government is not in a position right now to do large-scale infrastructure investments." Georgia Winery wines sold at Wal-Mart Georgia Winery wines can now be found at the Chattanooga Wal-Mart on Gunbarrel Road. The company said it's expanding with hopes to be found in more Wal-Marts in 2017. This summer, Georgia Winery said it's more than doubling its capacity as Tennessee grocery stores, which were allowed to sell wine on July 1, are stocking its sweet muscadine and fruit wines. The winery is installing 10 new 3,000-gallon stainless steel tanks and four new 6,500-gallon stainless steel tanks, which will add 56,000 gallons to the 53,500 gallons of fermenting tank capacity already in use at its wine-making facility and tasting room near Ringgold, Ga., on Battlefield Parkway just off Interstate 75. Local gas prices nearly 10 percent below U.S. average Gas prices in Chattanooga continued to fall last week, dropping to the lowest level since early summer. The average price of a gallon of gas in Chattanooga at the start of the week was $1.94 per gallon, down 5.5 cents per gallon from a week earlier and down nearly 20 cents a gallon from a month ago, according to GasBuddy's daily survey of 170 gas outlets in Chattanooga. This compares with the national average that fell 2 cents per gallon last week to $2.20 per gallon, the gasoline price website GasBuddy.com said today. Law firms to combine The law firms of Baker Donelson and Ober|Kaler have announced plans to combine. The combination, which has been approved by the leadership and shareholders of both firms, is anticipated to take effect Jan. 1. The combined firm, which will maintain the name of Baker Donelson, will become one of the 50 largest law firms in the country, with more than 800 attorneys and advisors across 25 offices in nine states as well as Washington, D.C. Building unemployment declines to 6-year low The jobless rate among workers in the building industry fell in September to the lowest September rate in six years as construction continued to rebound from the Great Recession. But the unemployment rate for building workers was still above the national average in Tennessee and Alabama during September, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. In Tennessee, the construction unemployment rate over the past year fell by seven-tenths of a percent to 6.1 percent in September. The jobless rate in the construction industry was unchanged over a year ago in Alabama at 7.6 percent. But in Georgia where the Atlanta area has rebounded, the jobless rate for construction workers in September was only 4 percent, down 0.5 percent from a year ago.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive log in Editorial: Vote ‘yes’ for better treatment of farm animals Monday Oct 31, 2016 at 11:45 PM Nov 1, 2016 at 10:45 AM One could argue that Massachusetts is behind the times when it comes to the prevention of cruelty to farm animals. In November, voters will be asked, in Ballot Question 3, to phase out "extreme methods of farm animal confinement” and ban the sale of eggs, veal or pork from an animal that is confined “in a cruel manner.” Ten states have already passed similar laws, and many major retailers, including Walmart, McDonald’s and Dunkin Donuts, have already promised to sell only cage-free eggs in the coming years. In short, Question 3 would ensure that farm animals are given enough space to stand up, turn around, and extend their limbs. Similarly worded ballot questions have never lost in other states, and polls show commanding support (about 66 percent) for the Massachusetts ballot initiative. Opponents of the ballot question have not even been able to establish a financial organization to fight the measure. They argue the change will hurt low-income families by driving up the cost of food, but there’s not much evidence of a sharp, sustained increase in prices in California, where similar rules have been in place for years. Even the egg industry is not aggressively fighting the ballot question. While Bill Bell of the New England Brown Egg Council is against the ballot measure, he told Politico that his organization’s resources would be better spent not opposing the ballot question but instead working with individual farmers to comply with private industry’s moves toward cage-free egg and meat production. Nevertheless, Sullivan, an anti-poverty lawyer, argues from a social justice perspective in her efforts to support low-income access to food. But supporters argue the cage-free egg measure will increase the cost of a dozen of eggs by only about 15 cents, or a little more than a penny per egg. Opponents say it might be as much as 80 cents a dozen. Considering egg prices fluctuate by at least that much quite frequently it still seems the cost is not prohibitive. And the financial impact on the state’s farmers is limited. Only one farm in Massachusetts does not produce cage-free eggs: Diemand Farm in Wendell. The majority of Massachusetts’ eggs come from out of state and would be subject to the cage-free law to be sold in-state. As for other animals affected by this ballot measure, calves raised for veal are often chained by their necks in crates too narrow to turn around or lie down comfortably. The vast majority of pork sold in Massachusetts comes from industrial factory farms where female pigs used for breeding are confined in crates only about two-feet wide - so small the animals can’t turn around or take more than a step forward or backward. To give producers and retailers ample time to comply with this measure, it will not take effect until 2022. We support the humane treatment of farm animals, as do many farmers. We recommend voting Yes on Question 3 on Nov. 8.   About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Communities Work for Us Milford Daily News Ads Find your Wicked Local town Ashland Framingham Shrewsbury Holliston Hopkinton Hudson Marlborough Westborough More Communities Natick Northborough Southborough Sudbury Wayland Weston Wicked Local Site Services Subscribe E-Edition Submit Your News Find Us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Advertise With Us Contact us See us on Instagram Find us on Tumblr Market Place Classifieds Find Framingham Jobs Real Estate © Copyright 2006-2016 GateHouse Media, LLC.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Wednesday November 16, 2016 News Local News Larger / SmallerNight Mode Witty Brit’s satire art Amber Wilson@ambervwilson 1 Nov 2016, 2 p.m. His intention is to poke fun, blend the “sublime with the absurd”, and incite us to ask questions. Usurping: British satirist David Ferry is currently exhibiting a collection of works at Post Office Gallery during his visit to Australia. Picture: Kate Healy His intention is to poke fun, blend the “sublime with the absurd”, and incite us to ask questions. David Ferry’s work can be seen in some of the world’s best galleries such as New York’s MOMA, but he has now touched down in Ballarat as Federation University’s current artist-in-residence. The highly-regarded British satirist pokes fun at his home country’s class system using photo montage, defacing images of stately British homes with pictures of junk food or goldfish. The result is disarming, hilarious and thought-provoking. The emeritus professor of printmaking at Cardiff Metropolitan University and printmaking consultant for the Sidney Nolan Trust is in Australia after giving a keynote address in Melbourne on the enduring legacy of British satirical art. Growing up working class in Blackpool, Ferry said he wanted to question the established superiority of the upper class. “Things, we assume, in a museum or stately home have to be particularly better than ourselves, posh,” he said. “Aquarium life is something you can almost buy in Walmart, you couldn’t buy a stately home in Walmart (or at all) unless you are part of the heritage gentry of Britain. I’ve turned the tide over. Instead of having the aquarium in a council-assisted apartment, the stately home is home of the aquarium itself.” But he said his work was not necessarily anarchic political statements. “As much as I’m allowing myself to go, I’m not an agent provocateur.” “The sublime and the ridiculous, is where people like me slice in the middle, the fissures, the cracks.” Ferry said many of the images he found of stately British buildings seemed to have no people, traffic, grime or life – they were almost sterile. “What I try to do is populate them by cutting out other things and sticking them where they normally weren’t,” he said. “Photography is interesting, it’s essentially a kind of lie. It’s what we want to see in it or what the photographer wants us to see in it. “I’m not a painter of architecture, I’m a commentator of why that architecture is perhaps there or what one can do to usurp it by sticking something in front of it.” The Invader’s Guide to the British Isles is being held a the Post Office Gallery, Camp Street, until November 20.

The original incident occurred in front of a Walmart store on Worth Avenue in the Woodbridge area about 10 p.m., police said. Surveillance video showed two men pushing a third into the trunk of a car, then getting into the vehicle and driving off. On Monday, however, police said they reviewed additional footage, showing the three people in the incident, victim included, appearing to enter the store five minutes after the trunk incident. They said the possible victim did not appear to be in distress, and did not seem to try to escape from the other two. The three all left the store after spending 40 minutes inside, police said. The county police asked the public to identify those shown in the surveillance footage, so police and contact them to find out the nature of the incident and to check on the welfare “of the alleged victim.” local public-safety Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

Walmart's latest pilot might be the answer. Walmart has built a vending machine style tower at its Bentonville, Arkansas location that fulfills shoppers BOPIS orders seamlessly and automatically. According to Business Insider when a customer approaches the giant product-filled tower, they simply enter their online order number and the machine produces their products out of a vending machine style shoot. While Walmart is still piloting the new in-store fulfillment technology the tower can potentially solve one of the key challenges retailers face with BOPIS — speedy, seamless, accurate order fulfillment. "We know speed and convenience are important to our customers, and we're always looking for new ways to bring it to them," Walmart spokesman Kory Lundberg told Business Insider. "We are excited to be one of the first companies to test this new technology and are looking forward to hearing feedback from our customers and associates."

(WKRN) – A Cheatham County man spent a mandatory 12 hours in jail for a crime he didn’t commit. It all began earlier this month when Charlie Green was charged with assaulting his soon-to-be ex-wife after she made a call to 911. In that call, Green’s estranged wife Kaitlyn told the dispatcher that he and his new girlfriend showed up unannounced. When asked if they physically attacked her, she responds by saying, “Yes, they did, my husband and his new girlfriend.” Deputies arrived to investigate, and the 26-year-old victim reportedly had marks on her arm and neck. After gathering statements from others at the home who claim they witnessed the attack, Green was arrested and spent 12 hours in jail. Charlie Green (Courtesy: Cheatham County Sheriff’s Office) Upon his release, the father-of-two pleaded his case to Sheriff Mike Breedlove, insisting he was innocent and that he had proof. That’s when the sheriff began investigating. “I hear that every day. There was something different about this gentleman. He was adamant and he practically begged, ‘Please look at the surveillance video,'” Breedlove told News 2. According to the sheriff, at the very time Green was allegedly assaulting his soon-to-be ex, he was actually at Walmart in Ashland City and there is surveillance video to prove it, as well as receipts with time-stamps. After leaving Walmart, Green went to a nearby laundromat. Kaitlyn Green (Courtesy: Cheatham County Sheriff’s Office) “Physically, there was no way,” Breedlove said. “He was at two different locations – businesses and had surveillance to back it all up. It was all a fabrication. It truly was an innocent man who had to sit 12 hours in jail.” Detectives then brought Kaitlyn Green and her witnesses in for questioning, which is when Breedlove determined they fabricated the story. News 2 spoke with Green on Monday and she told News 2 she did it to protect her two kids. “Whenever we split, he threatened to take my kids and I felt like if I could keep him away from me and keep him away from my children, he wouldn’t be able to hurt me or my kids,” she explained. She added she knows what she did was not the best plan of action and she said she won’t do it again. Green and her two friends have since been filed with filing a false report, while Charlie Green’s domestic violence charges were dropped. “I really appreciate all his hard work and what he did for me,” Charlie Green said.

The Royal Canadian Legion is notifying the public after receiving a report of fraudulent poppy sales. Legion member Chuck Kidd told the Herald they received word on Saturday (Oct. 29) that a person had been walking around the Walmart parking lot selling poppies. “Well you don’t sell poppies to begin with,” Kidd said. He said they are not sure who this person might be or if there are any other reports of this occurring. The poppies that uniformed members of the Legion distribute are available at tables set up outside Extra Foods, Save-On-Foods and Walmart. Poppies are also available at local businesses in town. While people are welcome to give a donation, they are not required to purchase a poppy. Kidd said they notified the RCMP of the alleged activity. RCMP Const. Tracy Dunsmore told the Herald it seems morally unethical to sell poppies, but isn’t sure that it’s technically a crime. “If they’re representing themselves as [Legion members] and they’re telling people that they’re giving the money to the Legion and they’re not then there’s a possible case of fraud,” Dunsmore said. “If you are buying a poppy ensure that the money is going towards the Legion,” she said. The Legion’s poppy fund campaign raised about $13,000 locally last year. The funds raised are used exclusively for veterans and dependents for their ongoing medical issues and needs.   This story was updated on Nov.1 to include comment from RCMP Const. Tracy Dunsmore, and additional comment from Kidd stating that the Legion is unaware of any other reports of this activity or who the person in question might be. featuredfraudnewspoppiesRoyal Canadian Legion Tweet Pin It Related Posts Police still investigating stolen ...

Tupelo patrol officers were notified that a suspected felony shoplifter was in JC Penney. The suspect, Jeremy Jerrell Hunter, 23, of Okolona, fled on foot from officers. The chase stretched from JCPenney to Walmart on North Gloster, where Hunter was captured without incident. The initial investigation revealed that Hunter had three outstanding felony arrest warrants for shoplifting and nine outstanding misdemeanor warrants for shoplifting. All warrants were from the city of Tupelo. Hunter was also charged with felony shoplifting related to theft of items from JCPenney shortly before the foot chase began. Approximately $2,700 in stolen merchandise was recovered at the time of Hunter’s arrest. Hunter was out on bond from additional felony shoplifting charges. Click here to leave a comment!

 Future of Payments: Four Trends to Know in Payment Processing Andrew Meola Oct. 31, 2016, 4:33 PM 2,857 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII The payments industry has been evolving rapidly, especially in the last few years with the growing shift to digital.  The global payments ecosystem is constantly changing as new startups try to change the way we move money around the world. Mobile wallets and the increased importance of card security to reduce fraud are some of the major trends that are shaping the future of payments processing. Below, we've compiled a list of these types of innovative payment processing that will mark the future of the payments industry, and provided examples of each. Four Trends in Payments Processing Mobile Wallets Mobile wallets could be the single biggest transformation in payments processing if they take off in the way that many analysts expect. Retailers are particularly excited about mobile payments because they can offer valuable insights about customer transactions that companies can use to enhance the shoppers' experience. The speed of mobile payments can also help increase foot traffic in stores, which in turn would generate more sales. In 2014, Apple was the only major mobile wallet on the market. But in 2015, Google and Samsung launched their own mobile wallets, and Walmart, Chase, and other major players joined the market. BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, expects in-store mobile payment volume to grow from $75 billion in 2015 to $503 billion in 2020. Digital Remittance Migrants have been sending money to their families and friends in their home countries for decades, but the digital shift is making that process easier than ever. And while digital still just holds a small portion of the global remittance market, growth at digital startups is tremendous. In 2014, $583 billion were remitted across borders in 2014, and the World Bank expects that number to climb to $636 billion in 2017. BI Intelligence notes that digital accounted for 6% of all remittances in 2014. But digital's share is growing thanks to the work of startups. Xoom, founded in San Francisco in 2001, grew 53% between 2012 and 2013 and 30% between 2013 and 2014. It now makes more revenue from digital than legacy company MoneyGram, the second-largest remittance company in the world. BII Payments Security The U.S. has a major problem with credit card fraud, which cost retailers $32 billion in 2014. To mitigate this, card networks strongly encouraged merchants to upgrade to EMV security, which is the standard in other parts of the world. EMV cards have an embedded microchip for extra security. In October 2015, fraud liability shifted to merchants from card issuers. And today, interest in EMV terminals is rising. Small business owners had been one of the most hesitant groups in terms of upgrading to EMV, but that has changed as of the third quarter of 2016. In Q3, more than half of all small businesses had upgraded, up from just 31% one year earlier. mPOS Mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) devices were extremely disruptive when they first debuted because they provided a sleek and easy way for all merchants to accept card payments. Today, consumers expect merchants everywhere to accept cards, so mPOS terminals have become even more important. BI Intelligence forecasts that there will be 27.7 million mPOS devices in circulation in the U.S. by 2021, up from just 3.2 million in 2014. Retailers will be the biggest group pushing the mPOS ecosystem to these new heights. Square, one of the more popular credit card processing companies in the U.S., is evidence of this. Large sellers (those who have more than $125,000 in annualized sales) represented 42%, or $5.25 billion, of Square's gross purchase volume in Q2 2016, up from just 8% in Q2 2011. More to Learn Mobile shopping trends are pointing to m-commerce as the wave of the future for shoppers. But mobile shopping is just one aspect of the broader payments ecosystem. That's why BI Intelligence spent months compiling the best and most exhaustive guide on the world of payments entitled The Payments Ecosystem Report: Everything You Need to Know About The Next Era of Payment Processing.

Legacy remittance firm MoneyGram announced “solid improvements to key financial metrics” in its Q3 2016 earnings report on Friday, noting growth across the board despite geopolitical and economic headwinds in key receive markets. However, the firm’s tempered growth points to an ongoing need for innovation if MoneyGram wants to remain competitive with peers and upstarts in the digital space. The firm’s transaction-based revenue continues to grow solidly, with a 5% constant currency increase in the quarter driven by non-US and US outbound transfer, which had the highest growth rate of any region. It’s likely the firm is looking to capitalize on high-growth areas, because MoneyGram just extended its partnership with Walmart in order to make it easier and cheaper for US customers to send funds to Mexico. That might drive more users to MoneyGram and increase volume, which could further accelerate the segment. But though digital growth continues to outpace the firm’s overall success, the segment continues to slip. This could put the firm behind on previously set goals. MoneyGram’s digital revenue grew 12% year-over-year (YoY), and now represents 13% of all money transfer revenue. This represents a continued slowing in the segment, which grew by 17% in the previous quarter and by 71% in Q3 2015 a year ago. MoneyGram noted that it’s a result of “grow-over” of its successful website re-launch. But the firm has been aiming to have 15-20% of its money transfer revenue derive from its digital segment by 2017, a goal that it seemed to be on track to meet but could be slipping on. MoneyGram digital will need significant innovation in order to lift the segment and stay competitive. Legacy peers are seeing strong digital growth, and at the same time, digital upstarts are increasing their offerings to become more competitive. MoneyGram is seeing some success with its site, which continues to drive new customers, but will have to continue to invest in high-growth areas, like it recently did with mobile improvements and third-party partnerships, in order to stay towards the top of the ecosystem. Every year, migrants send hundreds of billions of dollars worth of remittances back to friends and family in their home country. And there's a massive industry that facilitates these payments — and has for more than a century. The legacy remittance industry has been long dominated by cash, which requires physical locations where customers can hand over or pick up money. Building out those retail networks is a huge investment. It's left just a few players, called Money Transfer Operators (MTOs), controlling a bulk of the industry. But these companies' comfortable hold on the industry is now being challenged by digital remittance startups. Digital-first remittance companies are competing on fees and usability, and capitalizing on the way people's expectations have changed with the advent of digital and mobile channels. Evan Bakker, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on digital remittance that sizes the total remittance market, company-specific market share, digital's market share, and digital's growth at major remittance firms. It also assesses how disruptive digital startups have been by comparing their fees with market leaders, and by juxtaposing their business models with those of legacy companies. Here are some of the key takeaways: Digital's share of the global remittance industry is still fairly small at 6% — but growth is extremely fast at digital-first startups and legacy companies. Fourteen year-old Xoom makes more revenue from electronic channels than 75 year-old MoneyGram, the second-largest remittance company in the world. Startups are undercutting incumbents' fees in certain corridors; however, legacy firms have matched prices in many major corridors. Legacy firms' businesses are already responding to the threats posed by digital by lowering fees and adjusting business strategies. However, they face lower margins if they continue to compete with startups on pricing. In full, the report: Sizes the remittance market and calculates major remittance companies' market share. Estimates digital's share of the market vs. cash. Quantifies digital's impact at remittance startups and legacy firms. Breaks down the business models employed by each type of remittance company, and determines which ones are in a better position for growth. Compares transfer fees in various corridors to assess the competitiveness of each firm. Explores other platforms that could completely upend the industry from the outside. Determines how legacy remittance companies will fare in the digital age – the answer may surprise you.

My intention is to inform the public about critical facts that are missing from the discussion about the taxation of the marijuana industry, and why they should view with skepticism the major claim of Proposition 205 proponents; namely, that the legalization will bring in additional tax revenue, particularly for schools. The marijuana industry in Arizona has failed to follow basic state law regarding the listing and reporting of their business personal property in Arizona. What is business personal property? Basically, every business owns personal property that they utilize to operate their business. This can range from basic things like computers, office furniture and storage racks to specialized equipment that a marijuana growing facility might use like grow boxes, air filtration systems, misting and drip systems, special lighting. These items all have value and must be reported to the county assessor in the county that they are located each year. The law requiring the listing and reporting of business personal property is a self-reporting, or “on-your-honor” system, which law-abiding businesses in this state comply with. Businesses as large as Intel, Discount Tire, Wal-Mart, and then on down to those smaller “mom and pop” business owners do their best to accurately and timely report business personal property to my office. In fact, there are nearly 10,000 separate business personal property accounts listed with the Maricopa County Assessor’s Office. Marijuana business owners, growers and dispensaries, on the other hand, have failed to file anything since they became legal to operate in 2012. By my best estimates, there are approximately 50 dispensaries in Maricopa County, and not a single one has complied with the law. Why does this matter? Because nearly 70 percent of taxes collected from the assessment of business personal property taxes goes to fund local education. This means that non-compliance by the marijuana industry in Arizona in listing their business personal property and their subsequent failure to pay any taxes whatsoever is impacting the education of our children. After the Great Recession, with leadership from Governor Ducey, Arizonans approved Proposition 123 to get over $1 billion in new funding to schools. Yet, at the same time state leaders are looking for ways to obtain more dollars for schools, the marijuana industry shirks their legal obligations to pay their fair share of taxes on the personal property used in the creation of a product still illegal under federal law. I hear talk by the marijuana industry that the passage of recreational marijuana will bring more tax dollars into Arizona, and also that the passage of Proposition 205 will legitimize what has previously been a black market business. My response is, how can we trust the marijuana industry, which will be, by law, comprised  of the same actors already in business, to act like legitimate business owners when they have evaded their responsibility to follow the law like everyone else? There is an old saying that bears repeating here: “Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.” Arizonans would be wise to remember this when they decide how they vote on Proposition 205. I, however, refuse to be made the fool by the marijuana industry and will vote “No” on November 8.

Sol Saguaro October 27, 2016 , 1:50 pm at 1:50 pm PS Paul Petersen is identified as a Republican politician by a Maricopa Co. GOP voters club: http://gop.scwclubs.com/candidates/. One wonders, does he or doesn’t he support Donald Trump, who hasn’t paid taxes — probably in AZ as elsewhere — for the last 18 years? One might expect a tax assessor to be consistently hard on these issues. Where’s Petersen’s renunciation of Trump? Nowhere. More hypocrisy. Dave K October 31, 2016 , 11:02 am at 11:02 am The crooks that support this prohibition are truly getting desperate and they care little about protecting people in Arizona. They ignore that many in Arizona already use marijuana and that our underground market is controlled by some of the most violent criminals in the hemisphere, the Mexican drug cartels. These folks do not ask for ID’s and they also make available fentanyl, cocaine, crystal meth, ecstasy, and black tar heroin to our kids. Call me crazy but it makes sense to me to have marijuana sold by legal retailers who do not sell other drugs and ask for ID’s. This is working to decrease underground sales in Colorado. While they fight marijuana that has never killed by overdose in all of human history they ignore the fact that more Arizonans die of opiate overdose deaths than die of traffic accidents. We need to focus our priorities on those substances that do kill Arizonans. “The elimination of the unregulated black market is often cited by legalization proponents as a benefit of creating a legal, commercial marijuana market. In Colorado and Washington, those black markets have persisted to an extent, frustrating regulators and providing fodder for legalization critics. The new report suggests, however, that the black market is being significantly reduced by legalization, and that those reductions will continue.” http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-colorado-marijuana-industry-20161031-story.html Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The Radford Theatre is hosting the live-action Rocky Horror Picture Show Saturday night at 11:59 p.m. Rocky Horror Picture Show was filmed in 1975 , and is about two conservative newlyweds who get trapped in a house full of transgenders. It was supposedly the worst film of that time, so people made jokes about it, talked back to the movie, used props to throw at certain scenes (like rice at the wedding), and basically “interacted” with the characters. Since then, it has been a tradition to play late at night near Halloween weekend. Tickets are $8.50 and will include an audience participation kit. For more information, visit http://www.radfordtheatre.com/showtimes.html St. Albans Sanatorium is open Fridays and Saturdays for their “Haunted House: A Nightmare to Remember” program from 7:00 p.m. to midnight. Prices are $15 per person. Parking is free and there is as free shuttle service running from Matt Hogan Outdoors (located near Walmart). For more information, visit http://www.stalbansnightmare.com/tickets/ On Halloween night, the sanatorium is having a “Halloween Ghost Hunt.” Registration starts at 7:00 p.m. and the investigation is from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m. Tickets are $50 each. For more information, visit http://stalbans-virginia.com/public-paranormal-investigations/ Catholic Campus Ministries (CCM) in Radford are having a “St. Jude’s Feast Day Festival” on Sunday from noon to 3:00 p.m. Games, activities, lunch, and live music are provided by CCM. This will take place at St. Jude Catholic Church on Tyler Road. More about this is on http://ru-ccm.wixsite.com/catholic/upcoming-events Downtown Radford is hosting the 2016 Radford Trick or Treat Trail and Harvestfest on Monday, October 31st from 3:30 – 6:30 p.m. Businesses participating will have a flyer in their window. Enjoy popcorn, games, and music for free. This is supported by the Radford Chamber of Commerce and the flyer is located at https://www.pinterest.com/pin/560276009877594152/ The Christiansburg Parks and Recreation Center is hosting a “Halloween Truck or Treat” on Saturday from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. Admission is free. During this, the center is hosting the 2016 Huckleberry Hustle 5K and 1 Mile Fun Run – “Getting Scary on the Huckleberry” from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. Awards are given to the most creative costumes (medals) as well as the top three winners of the race, winning $100, $50, and $25 respectively. Free breakfast is offered to the racers. The flyer for the two events is the picture above and can be found on http://www.christiansburg.org/DocumentCenter/View/6022 Sinkland Farms in Christiansburg will be open the last time this year for their pumpkin festival on Saturday and Sunday. On Saturday, they will be open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday from 1 to 5 p.m. Tickets are $10 each for adults over 16 and $5 for children age two-16. The New River Valley Mall in Christiansburg is having a Trick or Treat event on Monday from 6-9 p.m. Go around to the stores and collect candy! The mall asks adults to not wear masks. If you want to stay in for the weekend but still want to be in the Halloween spirit, you can have a 24-hour horror movie marathon with friends or by yourself. Netflix has a wide variety of horror and thriller movies just for this sort of occasion such as Hush, Curse of Chucky, The Secrets of Emily Blair, The Ouija Experiment, and Hellraiser. There’s also a browsing option on Netflix for classic Halloween movies. This option includes movies that aren’t as scary, such as Hotel Transylvania 2 and Sharknado, movies that are scary, such as Hush and Hellboy, and some freaky TV series such as American Horror Story and Bates Motel. You can also stay with the spirit by reading ghost stories and/or horror fanfiction, and making some ghostly recipes like spider pizzas decorated with olives. Since Halloween is on a Monday night, you can simply stay in, study, and munch on all the candy you like. It is Halloween of course.               Posted by Alexis Gardner on Oct 31 2016.

ELIHU SPENCER 31 October 2016 Next Article 2016 SAMPLE BALLOT Typography Font Size Default Reading Mode In dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew, I realized that it is times like these that you really appreciate all that we have as a community. I, for one, was amazed at how seemingly effortlessly we all evacuated and that we only encountered a few bumps as we all began to return home.  Communities are tested when a tragedy occurs, and Hilton Head Island, Bluffton, Beaufort County and the rest of the Lowcountry have been tested once again. And, once again, the full character of what we are came shining through. Notwithstanding our normal tendencies to cluster in our “tribes” or private gated communities, all of Hilton Head’s population has come together with the singular goal of getting our island back to normal. Since this is primarily a column dedicated to addressing issues surrounding business or the economy, let me examine how we can leverage the tragedy that was Matthew into something positive for our community. Hilton Head is truly a community of locally owned businesses. Once you get beyond the plethora of big corporation-owned grocery stores and banks, it is really difficult to find big chain stores. On the island, we’ll soon have even fewer big-box stores that, in some communities, have forced local businesses to close. I am actually thanking Wal-Mart for moving Sam’s Club to Bluffton. As we work to recover after Hurricane Matthew — an effort that is likely to take months or even years — it is important that we support our local business community. Obviously, Hilton Head Island’s economy is primarily driven by tourism and real estate, but its unique character is founded in places like Coligny Plaza, the traffi c circle-to-beach corridor and all the quirky shops scattered around the island. We even have a local hardware store, Grayco, and a local bank, CoastalStates Bank, and we might just be the only 40,000-population town in the county that can say that. While our families and homes were the first concern following Matthew, our local economy is a close and intertwined second.

Your participation and support of this effort is crucial in order for this initiative to succeed. Please say: YES count on me to be part of making the Lowcountry strong again. Sign at www.shopmorelocal.org   Local support for local businesses right now is particularly important because these companies can’t rely on visitors during this time of year. During this period of recovery, money is going to be spent on cleanup and rebuilding. Federal recovery aid and insurance payments are going to flow into our community, and this money will undoubtedly attract less-than-reputable roofers, builders, tree services and other contractors looking to make a fast buck. It is important to check to make sure whatever companies you use are insured and have secured a business license from the Town of Hilton Head Island. Even more importantly, consider the benefits of keeping these dollars local and hiring local companies. The benefits of “shopping local” — even for services such as roofing repair and tree removal — can’t be overstated. First, and foremost, these businesses are owned by our neighbors, and money spent locally stays local. Other reasons to shop local include assuring that local merchants continue to bring unique products and services to our community so we can avoid the need to travel to make purchases. We all, or at least most of us, are transplants to Hilton Head. We came to enjoy the robustness of this community — shopping, entertainment, incredible beaches — with most of the benefits of a larger city. This is just a reminder that after the experience of Hurricane Matthew, it is time to come together and support our neighbors as we go through the rebuilding process.

CBR asked if the technical issue was the result of a system upgrade. An Asda spokesperson said: “We are in the process of resolving a technical issue with our card payment system in stores. We’re continuing to process payments as quickly as we can but apologise to our customers for the inconvenience this has caused.” Asda IT is run in-house. The grocer is owned by US retail giant Walmart. It was the second time in a week that Asda was hit by a technical glitch. Seven days ago it was reported that Asda online customers were reportedly left frustrated after a glitch led to a cancelation of orders. According to theregister.co.uk an Asda spokesperson said at the time that the issue had been dealt with: “As an apology to our customers affected by a technical glitch today during a major system upgrade we are offering a £15 discount and are rebooking their orders for as soon as convenient to them.” In 2014 Asda opened a technology centre at its Leeds head office to raise its service levels for online customers. Walmart says: “Each week, nearly 260 million customers and members visit our 11,539 stores under 63 banners in 28 countries and e-commerce websites in 11 countries. With fiscal year 2016 revenue of $482.1 billion, Walmart employs approximately 2.3 million associates worldwide.” The BBC reported that queues formed and customers resorted to social media to vent frustration. It said Asda’s efforts to restore systems saw some stores back online quicker than others.   Tags Asda etail Homepage News List Retail Previous ArticleBroadband advertising clampdown forces Sky and BT price revamp Next ArticleCompany boards take charge of digital transformation in fight for survival Most read Cloud forces data centre traffic into the zettabyte era James Nunns 11th November 2016 London tech jobs to grow by a fifth despite Brexit Ellie Burns 11th November 2016 75,000 data protection officers needed worldwide for GDPR CBR Staff Writer 11th November 2016 Latest White Papers Overcome the Attacker Advantage with McAfee Endpoint Security By Intel Monitor Continuously.

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Mae Anderson. Updated October 31, 2016 9:14AM SHARE ALSO SEE Amazon Amazon Fresh Amazon Prime E-Commerce Mobile Commerce Grocery Delivery Jeff Bezos Amazon wants you to order your turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce online this Thanksgiving -- its latest effort to make its Prime subscription service a central part of food shopping, much the way it's done for other consumer goods. Right before the cooking-heavy months of November and December, Amazon rolled out a monthly payment option for its grocery delivery service, AmazonFresh. On Monday it expanded to several new cities including Chicago and Dallas. Amazon -- which has been working on expanding grocery delivery since 2007 -- is taking aim at the $650 billion grocery industry. It's a highly competitive arena filled with rivals like Walmart and Instacart trying to lure customers away from traditional grocery stores. Some reports suggest that Amazon plans to open grocery stores of its own, but the company has declined to comment. "Grocery is a massive market opportunity for them," said R.W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian. It's a notoriously tough business with low margins, since it's expensive to store and transport produce. But Amazon has spent years ironing out the kinks with its delivery service, he said. Amazon near-decade of experimentation "gives them the scale and expertise that comes with time, allowing them not only to fine tune the service, but also perhaps accelerate the rollout into other areas," Sebastian said. Humble Beginnings Amazon started its grocery delivery business around its home town of Seattle, and has since expanded to about 18 cities and regions, including London and New York. It has changed its pricing structure, too, having started with an annual $299 fee that included Prime membership. Its monthly pricing program -- $15 a month for members of its $99-a-year Prime loyalty program -- started earlier this month. Amazon doesn't disclose whether or not grocery delivery is profitable, but analysts say it's probably not. Rather, it's a way to drive revenue growth and hook users into the idea that they can buy every product from Amazon. "They have a user base with Prime that is inclined to use Amazon, and they're clearly leveraging that loyal membership base," Sebastian said. Amazon's monthly pricing model could indicate the business has become less of a money loser. "I think they've gotten to the point they can be more flexible," Sebastian said. "It's an expensive business to run and that flexibility in pricing shows they've gained some efficiencies." Ever-Expanding Prime Amazon has been continuously adding services to its Prime loyalty program, which offers free two-day shipping on many items and boasts an estimated 65 million members (Amazon does not disclose the figure). It also includes streaming music and video, photo storage and other perks. Adding services like grocery delivery and original video programming costs money, but Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos says it's worth it because Prime members spend more at Amazon. "If you become a Prime member you buy more from us," he said at a luncheon in New York on Thursday. And people that watch Prime Instant Video, for example, are more likely to convert from free trials to paid Prime membership, and are more likely to renew their Prime membership in subsequent years, he said. "That's what closes the loop from the business angle," he said. After posting little-to-no profit for years each quarter as it invested in its business, Amazon has begun to balance spending with revenue more prudently and has reported a profit in each of the past five quarters. On Thursday, Amazon said net income tripled to $252 million, or 52 cents per share, from $79 million, or 17 cents per share, in the prior-year quarter. That missed analyst expectations of 85 cents per share, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue jumped 29 percent to $32.71 billion in the period, which topped Street forecasts. Twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $32.57 billion. For the current quarter ending in December, Amazon said it expects revenue in the range of $42 billion to $45.5 billion. Analysts surveyed by Zacks had expected revenue of $44.7 billion. The third quarter is a seasonally light one compared to the bustling holiday quarter coming up. © 2016 Associated Press syndicated under contract with NewsEdge. All rights reserved.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Brian Fung October 31 Follow @b_fung (Barta IV) AT&T's recently announced deal to acquire Time Warner reflects massive changes in media and technology. Although regulators could challenge the acquisition or slap conditions on it that may limit how AT&T can use its new assets, the purchase hints at a future where a single company can monetize the same customer multiple times over, just through the customer's routine use of the Internet. Other Internet providers have made stabs at building this kind of business model. Verizon, for example, wants to do something similar with Yahoo and AOL. But if AT&T succeeds — and that's still a big if — it will be that much closer to turning its subscribers into virtual cash machines, going to them over and over to grow its revenue base. Here are a few ways that could work. Sell connectivity At its core, AT&T is a network company. Its main job until now has been to sell you access to communications, such as phone or Internet service. These services act as conduits to the information or media you can find once you're hooked as a subscriber. This business model is not going away. In fact, it is what allows all the other business models to follow. It is also the easiest to describe, because selling data plans is the most directly observable way in which AT&T makes money from consumers like you and me. Sell content  On top of selling you the network, companies such as AT&T increasingly want to sell you the content that travels over those networks — including shows like “Game of Thrones” or “Westworld.” Historically, these types of shows were only available on cable TV. But thanks to the Internet, accessing this content just becomes a matter of network capacity. And guess who does networks? AT&T. Because AT&T's merger with Time Warner could allow the telecom giant to control HBO's entire content catalogue, any money the premium channel makes could belong, ultimately, to AT&T. That includes the $15-a-month subscription fee that HBO charges for its Internet streaming app, HBO Now. HBO has been called the “crown jewel” of Time Warner, and AT&T knows it. Suppose you're an AT&T Wireless subscriber and you pay for HBO Now. In the wake of a successful merger with Time Warner, this would allow AT&T to double-dip into your wallet. Sell advertising This is the big one. Advertising, particularly of the targeted variety, forms the cornerstone of the entire Internet economy. And Internet providers want a big slice of it. To compete with other ad heavyweights like Google and Facebook, Internet providers need to collect and use behavioral data. That means analyzing your browsing history, your app usage history, your location history, your financial information and other data that can help build a picture of who you are as a consumer. And since your Internet provider is collecting a lot of this information anyway simply to provide the basic function of getting you where you want to go on the Internet, its perspective is, why not use that data for advertising? Armed with these insights, a company, such as AT&T, could approach a company, such as Walmart or Best Buy, and say, “I can reach this demographic for you. Do you want to advertise with us?” And if Walmart or Best Buy said yes, they could put their ads on any number of sites or channels owned by AT&T. As a result of the Time Warner merger, that could include platforms, such as TBS or CNN. Targeted ads promise to “feature prominently” and in some cases represent “the whole ball of wax” for telecom companies in the new digital economy, according to Craig Moffett, an industry analyst at MoffettNathanson. Things get even more intricate from here. Not only could the ads be targeted to a specific demographic, but thanks to a technique known as cross-screen advertising, a particular customer could see the same ad on their TVs that they do on their phones and their tablets. AT&T's tests show that cross-screen advertising can boost a company's sales by as much as 87 percent. If ads are about repeated messaging, this approach may be the purest — and most lucrative — form of it yet. Federal regulators voted last week to limit how Internet providers can use your data, in a victory for privacy advocates. Still, many consumers may voluntarily opt in to the advertising, particularly if they're offered financial incentives in exchange. Sell your data A company, such as AT&T, could put your data to work for its own advertising business. But it could also benefit by sharing your data with marketing firms and other third parties who can use that information themselves. Data brokers who traffic in behavioral insights are often invisible to the average consumer, but what they know about you can affect your choices, such as the types of credit you're offered. A network company with deep insights on its subscribers could sell the data to a third party. All of these different business models entail monetizing different aspects of the customer relationship. Under the right circumstances, a telecom company could theoretically use a customer as a cash machine by: 1. Selling her a mobile data plan 2. Convincing her to pay for premium content on top of that plan 3. Watching how the customer engages with that content 4. Showing them ads tailored to her engagement 5. Selling that engagement data to third parties That doesn't even begin to contemplate any potential cross-promotions or special bundles of content and service designed to lure even more customers into the ecosystem. Nor does it go into possible licensing deals with other businesses that could allow, for example, AT&T to charge other firms for the use of DC Comics' intellectual property, such as Batman or Superman. The upshot is that by melding content and distribution, telecom and cable companies likely envision a whole constellation of business models that may form the foundation for a new digital economy, one that orbits largely around them. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address.

Sports Photos Faces in Places Arts Around The Area People In Society Spotlight on Wicomico Social Lounge Route 50 Plan Changes Sought To ‘Make The Corridor More Commercially Viable’ Oct 27,2016 by Charlene Sharpe SNOW HILL – An update of the county’s commercial design standards and Route 50 corridor plan could help increase development along the well-traveled highway into Ocean City. Since February, a committee of county officials, planning professionals and area business people has been working on revisions to the county’s design guidelines and Route 50 corridor plan. The changes are meant to bring the documents, which were created in the 1990s, up to date and at the same time resolve any problems identified with them in recent years. “The corridor plan addresses the county’s identified most intense commercial development territory and as such, the commissioners have appointed a diverse group of individuals tasked with making timely recommendations that will make the corridor more commercially viable,” said Merry Mears, the county’s director of economic development. The committee, formally known as the Design Guidelines and Route 50 Corridor Plan Task Force, has been meeting monthly to go through the documents and make improvements to them. Ed Tudor, the county’s director of development review and permitting, says the original guidelines and corridor plan were written before the Walmart was built on Route 50. “Things have changed,” he said. The guidelines address commercial development in the area and the corridor plan outlines requirements for the service road that will eventually link properties between Holly Grove Road and Seahawk Road. “The goal is to review those items and make them more user friendly while still achieving the overall objectives of both,” said Mark Cropper, a local attorney and member of the group. As they come from different backgrounds, task force members have shared a variety of viewpoints on the documents and what they mean for different parties. In a meeting last week, task force member John Peters, who works for the Cordish Company, said increased requirements equated to higher costs for developers. “The cost of developing those pad sites [near Walmart] is becoming astronomically high,” he said. Another member of the task force, Steve Engel of Vista Design, voiced concerns about buffers and parking requirements. Others discussed inter parcel connectors and access points. Cropper, who routinely represents developers, believes the group’s meetings have resulted in significant improvements to the corridor plan. “I believe it will make developing along that corridor more attractive for those that in the past have had unpleasant experiences trying to do so,” he said. “This at least is a signal to developers that we’re open for business.” Mears agrees. “Worcester County is now in the position to grow this area substantially, and it must be done responsibly, with significant input from the business community,” she said. “I’m encouraged by the cohesiveness of the members involved, and I look forward to the outcomes of our work.” The group’s revisions are expected to be complete next month. The changes will then be sent on the Worcester County Commissioners for their approval. ← Previous Next → 0 shares About The Author: Charlene Sharpe Charlene Sharpe has been with The Dispatch since 2014.

But depending on your age, there are better investment options than others. I recently wrote a piece discussing a few of my favorite Exchange Traded Funds geared for all investors. Now I am working through different age groups and pointing out some of my favorite ETF's that are more focused on each age group based on where investors are in their life cycle and their interests. A month ago I published a piece geared toward 20-year-olds, and today we are going to focus on ETF options that fit better for those in their 30's. By the time you turn 30, a few things have or will soon likely happen in your life. You will have begun progressing in your career, you are making more money than when you were in your early 20's, you may be a home owner or planning to become one, you either have started a family or again have plans to do so, and lastly maintaining your health. With those three things in mind, I have found a few ETF's that play into those life changes. The first is the VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (PACF:RTH). I have spoken about RTH before; it's one of my favorite ETF's regardless of age, but I think it fits well in a 30-year-olds portfolio. When you're in that age bracket, you most likely have a higher income. Therefore you can spend a little more money on material things, and you don’t likely live with mom and dad anymore. You may even own a home or at the very least want your place to look and feel more adult-ish. When I last spoke about RTH, it was in a piece on how to play the housing boom. RTH owns a lot of retail stocks that benefit from new home construction or just people moving in general. Whether it’s a purchase or just changing locations, when you move into a new place most likely you are going to buy some new stuff; new shelves, rugs, towels, furniture, who knows. But what we do know is places like Amazon.com, Target, Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Lowes, Costco Wholesale, sell that kind of "adult" stuff. But, RTH isn't just a play on housing, it’s a play on you buying stuff in general, remember higher income through progressing with your career. RTH holds retail companies that whether or not you know it, you probably shop at on a weekly basis. Furthermore, buying shares of RTH now, and then regularly over the coming years will help you build a solid position in companies that you will probably be shopping for the next 40-50 years. (I know that sounds like a long time when you're only 30 something.) So start owning a little piece of those places you spend your hard earned money now and maybe it won't hurt so much when you do overspend at those places. The next ETF is the PowerShares Dynamic Leisure & Entertainment ETF (PACF:PEJ). This ETF owns a group of stocks that fall under the leisure and entertainment industries. Regardless of whether you have or haven't started a family, you are always doing something new, these companies that garner the bulk of your disposable income. Whether it's general travel, restaurants, and bars, amusement parks, or even casino's, just to name a few, PEJ focuses on four things when picking stocks to hold; the strength of a company's fundamentals is the company relevant to current times, valuation metrics, and its risk level. PEJ typically holds around 30 stocks that and has an expense ratio of 0.61%, a little high, but is good for those 30-year-olds who travel a lot and have an adventurous lifestyle. By sector PEJ is broken down as 31% airlines, 26% restaurants and bars, 10% hotels and cruise lines, 8% casinos and 8% leisure & recreation. PEJ has been around since 2005 and is currently yielding 0.53% while boasting an 11.7 average price to earnings ratio for the stocks it holds. And lastly, for those 30-year-olds that want to keep that 20-year-old body, The Health and Fitness ETF (BATS:FITS.IV) focuses on companies that are geared toward healthy, fit lifestyles. FITS is an investment play in the healthy fitness related shift we are seeing take place in the world today. It currently holds 74 stocks with some of the top holdings consisting of Adidas AG, Nike, Foot Locker, Under Armour, Lululemon, and Dick's Sporting Goods. Despite FITS inception date of June of 2016 and currently only having net assets of just $2.57 million, with more American's getting active and a larger push toward healthy living, FITS investors could see significant returns over the next few decades. The fund also boasts a yield of 0.73%, which will cover the expense ratio of 0.5%. Furthermore for those 30-year-olds with little one playing sports, owning small pieces of Nike, Adidas, and even Dick's Sporting Goods may make it easier when you spend money on the growing array of activities your kids are involved with. While the list above is not a full combination of what a 30-year-olds portfolio should look like, these ETF's should help get you started or make excellent additions to your current holdings. Perhaps you're not a 20 or 30-year-old; no problem check back soon to find out what ETF's fit your age group.

Now fair pay must become the norm Gavin Kelly From Ikea to BrewDog, Britain’s good employers see workers as a resource to be invested in, not a disposable commodity. The rest must follow suit ‘When Ikea decided to embrace the real living wage, it did so as part of a wider commitment to hours-security and workforce training.’ Photograph: Kumar Sriskandan/Alamy Monday 31 October 2016 11.00 EDT Last modified on Monday 31 October 2016 14.54 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Today’s announcement of this year’s increase in the living wage – to £9.75 an hour in London (previously £9.40) and £8.45 in the rest of the UK (£8.25) – will help the growing numbers benefiting from the fair pay benchmark. For a full-time worker it amounts to earning an extra £5,000 a year in the capital, and nearly £2,500 elsewhere, compared with a person on the government’s legal wage-floor (£7.20). That’s a big, life-changing difference. I’m paying my staff a real living wage – not George Osborne’s version | Martin Whitlock Read more It’s a difference, though, that has been partially obscured, not least in the eyes of the media, by the recent rebranding of the minimum wage – reincarnated as the “national living wage”. Many assumed that the ensuing terminological muddle would result in the demise of the voluntary (real) living wage, in a case of death by imitation. Well, it hasn’t worked out that way. The number of living wage employers has doubled since George Osborne first announced his revamping of the minimum wage. That’s a tribute to the employers and campaigners involved. But we need to keep this success in perspective: 6 million workers get paid less than the benchmark. Why, though, are ever more companies signing up? Polls of employers reveal a mix of motives. For some, committing to the living wage is a symbolic act that helps make good on standard corporate mantras about the workforce being a prized asset. Others highlight the desire to aim higher than merely avoiding breaking the law. And, of course, many are simply attracted by the reputational halo-effect that surrounds the living wage. All are welcome. Yet something else is going on too. For a growing number of employers it is the start of a wider shift in their business model: away from viewing workers as a cheap and disposable commodity, and towards one which sees them as a resource that needs to be invested in. An unlikely example is the rethink underway at Walmart, the most iconic low-paying employer in the US. Its management eventually came to realise that acting on declining sales, dirty stores and disappearing customers required a motivated workforce. Pay levels were raised from rock-bottom, training boosted and predictability of working hours increased. It’s still early days, but customer satisfaction and sales have both risen too. It’s a tale with echoes in the UK. When Ikea decided to embrace the real living wage – resulting in a pay-rise for thousands of workers – it did so as part of a wider commitment to hours-security and workforce training. Likewise when the small but rapidly growing craft brewery BrewDog took the same step, not only did two-thirds of the staff get a pay rise but zero-hour contracts were ditched as well. The result? Staff turnover plummeted and employee satisfaction has soared. The scale of the change that some employers are embarking upon, together with the living wage’s greater coverage, brings with it new responsibility. Now, more than ever, it needs to be – and be seen to be – a robust and credible benchmark. That’s why the Living Wage Commission, created to oversee the rates, has reviewed the underlying methodology and the data on which it relies. Its view is that the benchmark must, above all else, tell employers and employees the minimum that needs to be paid if households are typically to reach an acceptable, if modest, standard of living. The calculation underpinning the living wage may be complicated but the moral intuition behind it is not This means it must be rooted in an assessment of the cost of living as determined by the price of a basket of goods and services that the public itself deems to be essential. Consequently the contrasting methodologies that hitherto set the living wage rates in London and the rest of the UK have been aligned. When the price of this basket goes up, upward pressure on the living wage results. The corollary is that the living wage won’t be driven by other factors that people may be concerned about, such as wider trends in earnings or inequality. These technical but vital improvements occur at a time when the living wage campaign faces new challenges and opportunities. Over the coming year a spike in inflation, expected slower growth and Brexit uncertainty may make potential employers more cautious. Yet to dwell on the problems is to misjudge the moment. A diverse set of factors – concern over the “left behind” following the Brexit vote; a surge in unease about conditions at work following the Sports Direct scandal; the stunning success of the Fight for $15 movement across America; and, just possibly, the change in personnel in No 10 – suggest the campaign for fair pay may be moving with the tide. This isn’t vain hope. Whether it’s the bold decision of the Scottish government to pay all care workers the living wage, or that by the London mayor to expedite its coverage to all Transport for London’s sub-contractors, there is undoubtedly momentum. Across England a new generation of city mayors are about to be elected on a hazy if heartfelt agenda of “shared growth”. They, too, will need to be champions of fair pay. The calculation underpinning the living wage may be complicated but the moral intuition behind it is not. Building an economy that works for all requires reinforcing change on all manner of things from the welfare state to the fiscal stance. But policy alone won’t suffice. We also need to create a shared civic norm about what constitutes decent pay in the 21st century. On this, progress is being made.
