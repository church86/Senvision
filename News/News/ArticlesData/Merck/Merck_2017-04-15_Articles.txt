The index received a slight boost on Monday, primarily from energy shares, after U.S. oil prices closed at a one-month high. On Tuesday, the index slipped marginally following concerns over increase in geopolitical tensions including the U.S. attack on a Syrian air base and possible conflict with North Korea. These concerns flowed into Wednesday, leading to larger losses for the Dow. Last Week’s Performance The Dow declined marginally last Friday, dragged down by weaker-than-expected March jobs data and President Trump’s surprise attack against an airbase near Homs, Syria. Jobs data showed an increase of 98,000 jobs in March, marking the smallest gain in almost a year. Moreover, New York Fed President William Dudley’s comments hinting at a simultaneous rate hike along with Fed’s plan to reduce its balance sheet, adversely affected the equity market. Over the last week, the index declined 0.03%. During the week, stocks suffered a setback after the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve. Weak auto sales data and a dip in manufacturing growth rate also had an adverse impact on the investor sentiments which eventually led the benchmarks to finish in the red. The Dow This Week The index gained marginally on Monday, boosted primarily by energy shares, which gained after U.S. oil prices closed at a one-month high. Gains in energy shares offset some geopolitical turmoil including U.S. attack on Syrian air base last Thursday. Meanwhile investors remained focus on bank earnings set to begin later this week. Financials declined as investors expressed concerns over lofty valuations of equities and raised doubts over Trump’s ability to implement his pro-growth policies. The index declined a meagre 0.03% on Tuesday as investors remained concerned over increase in geopolitical tensions including the U.S. attack on a Syrian air base and possible conflict with North Korea. Investors remained focused on upcoming corporate earnings results while they also raised questions over Trump’s ability to implement deregulation policies. Meanwhile, Trump’s comments on revamping the Dodd-Frank law helped stocks pare losses. The index lost 0.3% on Wednesday as investors remained worried about rising geopolitical concerns including U.S. strike on a Syrian air base last week and escalating tension between U.S. and North Korea. The rise in geopolitical tensions led S&P 500 and Dow industrials to finish below their 50-day moving averages for the first time since November. The market’s fear gauge touched a five-month high. Investors also kept close watch on the Presidential election in France. Components Moving the Index 3M Company (MMM – Free Report) has over 109,000 patents in various categories across its product portfolio.

In the lawsuit filed in the Central District of California, 3M alleged that Phoenix violated seven patents, manufacturing some automotive painting spray gun cup products in China and selling them in the U.S. through K2 Concepts.

Island Trader Close advertorial The important role vaccines may play in helping keep children and adults healthy Brandpoint (BPT) Apr 14, 2017 Updated 18 hrs ago 0 (BPT) - Every one of the nearly 12,000 babies born in the United States each day may be susceptible to infectious diseases. The good news is that vaccines can help protect children from some of these diseases. As National Infant Immunization Week (NIIW) approaches, it is timely to remember the role that vaccinations can play in helping to prevent certain diseases among infants. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), it is estimated that routine vaccination of the nearly 4 million babies born in the US each year may help to prevent about 20 million cases of diseases that they could develop over their lifetime. In fact, over time, successful vaccination campaigns have contributed to the near elimination or elimination of some diseases in the U.S., like polio. Vaccination is considered to be one of the greatest public health achievements since 1900. NIIW, which is held April 22 – 29 this year, highlights the importance of helping to protect infants from diseases for which there are vaccines and celebrates the achievements of vaccination programs in helping to promote healthy communities. "Today vaccines can help to protect against 14 diseases before age two," explains Eddy Bresnitz, M.D., M.S., Executive Director, Merck Vaccines Global Health & Medical Affairs. "Failure to vaccinate may mean putting your children at risk for potentially serious diseases." “In the U.S., most young children receive many of the recommended vaccines, but there is room to improve vaccination rates among all groups, including adolescents and adults," says Bresnitz. In fact, the CDC has specific recommended vaccination schedules that cover children, adolescents and adults. Talk to your healthcare provider about vaccines that may be recommended for you and your loved ones, and visit www.vaccinesandyou.com to learn more. This information is provided by Merck.

Global Menopausal Hot Flashes Therapy Market by Products, Growth Trends and Forecast to 2021, New Research by iHealthcareAnalyst, Inc. Menopausal Hot Flashes Therapy Market by Therapy Types (Hormonal Therapy, Estrogen, Progestin, Combination Therapy, Non-Hormonal Therapy) and Forecast 2017-2021 Maryland Heights, MO, April 15, 2017 –(PR.com)– Hot flushes are a common symptom of the menopause experienced by most of the menopausal women as a sudden feeling of warmth or heat in the body, which are usually most intense over the face, neck and chest. Hot flushes may occur on their own but are often accompanied by night sweats or excessive sweating during the day. Other causes of hot flashes include breast and prostate cancer treatments. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is the most effective treatment for menopausal hot flashes. However, long term HRT has an increased risk of breast cancer and risk associated with increasing age such as stroke, blood clots, and other health related problems. Estrogen and progesterone are the most common hormonal regimens used to reduce hot flashes. Estrogen is the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms as it reduces the severity of vasomotor symptoms, often with improvement beginning within the first week of treatment. Other drugs used for the treatment of hot flashes include combination of bazedoxifene and conjugated estrogens, certain antidepressants, and other prescription medications.
