"Following" : "Follow"}} January 11, 2017 2:26pm   Comments Share: Shares of Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) are rallying strongly, while Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE: BMY) is being punished on Wednesday. News Behind The Move The contrasting moves come after Merck announced late Tuesday that the FDA has accepted to review the sBLA for KEYTRUDA, plus chemotherapy, for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic or advanced non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer regardless of PD-L1 expression and with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. Keytruda is Merck's anti-PD-1 immunotherapy for treating melanoma, which has spread or cannot be removed by surgery; non-small cell lung cancer, which has spread or has tested positive for PD-L1; and head and neck squamous cell cancer, which has returned or has become non-responsive to chemotherapy. FDA Favorably Disposed Merck clarified that this is the first application for regulatory approval of Keytruda in combination with another treatment. The FDA has granted priority review and the PDUFA date has been set for May 10, 2017. Additionally, the sBLA is to be reviewed under the FDA's accelerated approval program. Merck has presented positive results for Keytruda-chemotherapy combo from a mid-stage trial in October last, However, the markets were anticipating the filing for approval could be done only after data is obtained from a broader Phase III study. Why Is Bristol-Myers Bleeding? Bristol-Myers is developing a lung cancer drug called Opdivo . The immunotherapy turned in disappointing results last year when it was evaluated as a monotherapy. With the latest development, it looks like Merck will edge out its competition in bringing to the market its combo therapy. Other competitors also evaluating combination therapies include Roche Holding Ltd. (ADR) (OTC: RHHBY) and AstraZeneca plc (ADR) (NYSE: AZN). At Time Of Writing AstraZeneca was sliding 2.47 percent to $28.03. Bristol-Myers Squibb was slumping 5.53 percent to $56.67. Merck was adding 1.65 percent to $60.91. Roche was down 1.33 percent at $29.59. Posted-In: anti-PD-1Biotech News Health Care FDA Movers Trading Ideas General Best of Benzinga © 2017 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

DJIA S&P 500 NASDAQ Markets Today Bristol-Myers and AstraZeneca Take Beatings It happened in the wake of Merck's latest drug approval. Alicia McElhaney Jan 11, 2017 4:33 PM EST Bristol-Myers tablets Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) , Roche (RHHBY) and AstraZeneca (AZN) fell Wednesday on news that Merck (MRK) will get a faster-than-anticipated FDA review for its lung cancer drug Keytruda.  Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez wrote that the news "comes as a significant surprise" and gives Merck "another leg up" in the race to develop cancer drugs. The three are in competition with Merck for a lung cancer treatment that could be used in tandem with chemotherapy for the disease, so when Merck announced that FDA will approve the drug by May 10, investors were scared off.  Bristol-Myers has a lung cancer drug, Opdivo, in development (though it failed to show a benefit back in October). The company's drug was seen as a potential superstar in the space. On the news, it's shares fell 5.3%, or $3.18 per share, to a close of $56.80 apiece Wednesday.  Meanwhile, AstraZeneca's shares fell 2.54%, hitting $28.03 apiece midday Wednesday. The company closed down 1.78% from market's open. AstraZeneca has a pill that has shown promise for lung cancer treatment in development, called Tagrisso.  And Roche saw shares slip as well, falling 1.7%, hitting $29.50 apiece. Roche has a drug already approved by the FDA for the treatment of lung cancer called Tecentriq.  Merck's shares, meanwhile, got a boost on the news. The company saw shares climb 2.85% from market's open, hitting $61.63 apiece before markets closed.  The company presented at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference on Jan. 9.  Editor's note: This story was originally published at 12 pm ET and has been updated to reflect closing prices.

(Globe staff photo / Craig F. Walker) By Robert Weisman Globe Staff  January 11, 2017 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. will receive an upfront payment of $230 million from German drug maker Merck KGaA to license four of the Boston biotech’s cancer drug research programs. The licensing deal, disclosed Wednesday, effectively turns over the research, development, and commercialization of Vertex’s entire cancer drug pipeline to Merck, which owns the US biotech EMD Serono in Rockland. If any of Vertex’s compounds are eventually approved as medicines, the company would also receive royalties amounting to a share of future sales. Advertisement Under the deal, Germany’s Merck, a separate company from the US pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co., obtains the global rights to two experimental compounds being tested by Vertex in clinical trials to inhibit DNA repair pathways key to the proliferation of certain cancers. Merck will also take over a pair of Vertex preclinical cancer drug research programs. “It’s a very strong strategic fit for us,” Merck’s global head of research and development Luciano Rossetti said. “To succeed in oncology, our company is focusing our efforts in specific areas we can drive, such as immuno-oncology and DNA damage and repair. These assets from Vertex perfectly complement our oncology efforts.” Get Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news, delivered weekdays. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here A spokeswoman said Vertex executives weren’t available for comment. The company stands to gain tiered royalties totaling up to 25 percent of sales for its clinical-stage cancer drug candidates and less than 10 percent for its preclinical cancer compounds. Shares of Vertex were trading down about 1.4 percent early Wednesday afternoon. Vertex, which sells two drugs to treat the lung disease cystic fibrosis, continues to develop additional cystic fibrosis treatments for patients with different genetic mutations of the ailment. Advertisement Its scientists are also working on treatments for pain and spinal cord injury. Earlier this week, in a presentation at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, executives said they are looking for ways to treat other conditions, ranging from sickle cell disease to polycystic kidney disease. Vertex spokeswoman Heather Nichols said the licensing deal won’t result in job cuts because researchers working on the early-stage cancer drugs will be assigned to other programs. While EMD Serono has been best known for drugs that treat multiple sclerosis and infertility, company executives last year said they are mounting a push into cancer therapies. At the J.P. Morgan conference, the company announced a strategic collaboration with MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston aimed at advancing development of EMD Serono’s experimental drugs to treat breast and colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, and leukemia.

Merck presented good results from a mid-stage Phase II trial for its Keytruda-chemotherapy combination at conference in Denmark in October Drugs giant Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE:MRK) has gained a march on its rivals after US regulators agreed to an accelerated review of the use of one of its immunotherapy products with other drugs as a treatment for lung cancer. The US Food & Drug Administration has accepted Merck's application to review a combination of its immune system-boosting drug Keytruda with chemotherapy as an initial therapy for the largest cancer market. The group said the FDA would decide by May 10 whether to approve the Keytruda combination treatment, with the drug already approved for the first-line treatment of lung cancer patients. Merck presented good results from a mid-stage Phase II trial for its Keytruda-chemotherapy combination at conference in Denmark in October. Immunotherapy is revolutionising some areas of cancer care, although providing it alone as a treatment only seems to work better than chemotherapy in previously untreated lung cancer patients.

"With this strategic deal, we significantly strengthen our oncology pipeline in two attractive areas where we have leading competence, DNA damage and repair and immuno-oncology—areas which also have promising therapeutic synergy," says Belén Garijo, CEO Healthcare and Member of the Executive Board of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. "This deal underscores our commitment to accelerate innovation for cancer patients, and we are excited for the opportunity to build on Vertex's rigorous science and advance these leading programs."  As part of the agreement, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany will license two clinical-stage programs targeting DNA damage and repair, along with two additional novel pre-clinical programs. Vertex will receive an upfront payment of $230 million, in addition to royalties on future net sales. Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany will assume full responsibility for the development and commercialization of all the programs. "The Vertex R&D team has produced a portfolio of first-in-class compounds with the potential to enhance the therapy of multiple cancers," said Jeffrey Leiden, Chairman, President and CEO of Vertex. "We are pleased to partner with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, a leader in oncology with exciting complementary assets that will help fully realize the value of these unique compounds and accelerate the programs' potential benefits for patients." The two clinical-stage programs represent first-in-class approaches to inhibit the DNA repair pathways that are fundamental to the survival and proliferation of certain cancers: An ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR) program comprised of two compounds, VX-970 and VX-803. VX-970 is being investigated broadly through 10 ongoing Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials across a variety of tumors and patient subtypes expected to be responsive to ATR inhibition based on biomarker data. Preliminary VX-970 clinical data were presented at the 2016 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting and the 2016 American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting. VX-803 is an orally dosed ATR inhibitor currently in Phase 1 trials evaluating escalating doses of VX-803 alone and in combination with chemotherapy. A DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) inhibitor program including the clinical candidate VX-984. A Phase 1 trial is now evaluating escalating doses of VX-984 alone and in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in subjects with advanced solid tumors. Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany will combine these assets with its existing DNA-PK assets into a single development program. The pre-clinical programs include one immuno-oncology program against an attractive target with first-in-class potential, and a program against a completely novel target. For both of these programs, Vertex research has demonstrated efficacy in relevant pre-clinical models, including demonstration of combination potential with immune checkpoint inhibition for the immuno-oncology program. Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany will continue to characterize the Vertex compounds in these programs with the goal of taking them forward into the clinic. The strength of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany's oncology R&D program, including a leading presence in immunotherapy and DNA damage and repair, demonstrates how the company is re-imagining the way cancer can be treated.  About Vertex Vertex is a global biotechnology company that aims to discover, develop and commercialize innovative medicines so people with serious diseases can lead better lives.

Eli Lilly and Company Eli Lilly and Company logo. (PRNewsFoto, Eli Lilly and Company) (PRNewsFoto/Eli Lilly and Company)     Facebook Twitter Pinterest Eli Lilly and Company logo. (PRNewsFoto, Eli Lilly and Company) (PRNewsFoto/Eli Lilly and Company) INDIANAPOLIS, Jan. 11, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced the expansion of an existing immuno-oncology collaboration with Merck, known as MSD outside the U.S. and Canada, through a subsidiary, to add a new study of Lilly's LARTRUVO™ (olaratumab) with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in patients with previously treated advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma (STS). Notably, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently granted accelerated approval for LARTRUVO (olaratumab injection, 10 mg/mL), in combination with doxorubicin, for the treatment of adults with STS with a histologic subtype for which an anthracycline-containing regimen is appropriate and which is not amenable to curative treatment with radiotherapy or surgery. LARTRUVO (olaratumab injection, 10 mg/mL), in combination with doxorubicin, also recently received conditional marketing authorization from the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of adults with advanced STS not amenable to curative treatment with surgery or radiotherapy and who have not been previously treated with doxorubicin. "We look forward to further expanding our collaboration with Merck to include this combination study focused on advanced soft tissue sarcoma, a rare and difficult-to-treat disease with limited treatment options," said Sue Mahony, Ph.D., senior vice president and president, Lilly Oncology. "This collaborative study builds on the exciting data we have seen with olaratumab and supports our focus on investigating the potential of rational combinations to enhance efficacy and change the standards of care for people with cancer." "Historic and present day scientific advances continue to reinforce the role of combination therapies in extending the lives of people with cancer," said Eric Rubin, M.D., vice president and therapeutic area head, oncology early-stage development, Merck Research Laboratories. "Our collaboration with Lilly exemplifies our commitment to fully exploring combination regimens with KEYTRUDA to help arm physicians with the treatment tools they need to help their patients."    Lilly is the sponsor of the Phase 1 study and enrollment is expected to begin mid-2017. Financial details of the collaboration were not disclosed. In addition to the study announced today, other ongoing trials between Lilly and Merck, through a subsidiary, include: Studies of pemetrexed (plus carboplatin) and pembrolizumab in first-line nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), including a Phase 3 study that is currently enrolling patients; A Phase 1 study examining the combination of ramucirumab with pembrolizumab in NSCLC, gastric cancer and bladder cancer; A Phase 1 study examining the combination of necitumumab with pembrolizumab in NSCLC; and A Phase 1 study examining the combination of abemaciclib, a CDK 4 and 6 inhibitor, with pembrolizumab. Based on the Phase 1 trial results, the collaboration has the potential to progress to Phase 2 trials in patients who have been diagnosed with either metastatic breast cancer or NSCLC. Olaratumab (marketed under the brand name LARTRUVO™) is a platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR-α) blocking antibody that specifically binds PDGFR-α and prevents receptor activation. LARTRUVO exhibits in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity against selected sarcoma cell lines and disrupted the PDGFR-α signaling pathway in in vivo tumor implant models. Pembrolizumab (marketed under the brand name KEYTRUDA®) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that works by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. Pembrolizumab blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes, which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. NOTES TO EDITORS About Sarcomas Sarcomas are a diverse and relatively rare type of cancer that usually develop in the connective tissue of the body, which include fat, blood vessels, nerves, bones, muscles, deep skin tissues and cartilage. Soft tissue sarcoma is a complex disease with multiple subtypes, making it very hard to diagnose and difficult to treat. For decades, there have been no front-line therapeutic advancements for STS that have improved overall survival. According to the American Cancer Society, in 2015, there were an estimated 12,000 new STS cases diagnosed and nearly 5,000 deaths in the U.S. alone.  INDICATION LARTRUVO is indicated, in combination with doxorubicin, for the treatment of adult patients with soft tissue sarcoma (STS) with a histologic subtype for which an anthracycline-containing regimen is appropriate and which is not amenable to curative treatment with radiotherapy or surgery. This indication is approved under Accelerated Approval. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trial. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR LARTRUVO Warnings and Precautions Infusion-Related Reactions Infusion-related reactions (IRR) occurred in 70 (14%) of 485 patients who received at least one dose of LARTRUVO across clinical trials. For 68 of these 70 patients (97%), the first occurrence of IRR was in the first or second cycle. Grade ≥3 IRR occurred in 11 (2.3%) of 485 patients, with one (0.2%) fatality. Symptoms of IRR included flushing, shortness of breath, bronchospasm, or fever/chills, and in severe cases symptoms manifested as severe hypotension, anaphylactic shock, or cardiac arrest. Infusion-related reactions required permanent discontinuation in 2.3% of patients and interruption of infusion in 10% of patients. All 59 patients with Grade 1 or 2 IRR resumed LARTRUVO; 12 (20%) of these patients had a Grade 1 or 2 IRR with rechallenge. The incidence of IRR in the overall safety database (N = 485) was similar (18% versus 12%) between those who did (56%) and those who did not (44%) receive premedication. Monitor patients during and following LARTRUVO infusion for signs and symptoms of IRR in a setting with available resuscitation equipment. Immediately and permanently discontinue LARTRUVO for Grade 3 or 4 IRR. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on animal data and its mechanism of action, LARTRUVO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal knockout models link disruption of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR-α) signaling to adverse effects on embryo-fetal development. Administration of an anti-murine PDGFR-α antibody to pregnant mice during organogenesis caused malformations and skeletal variations. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LARTRUVO and for 3 months after the last dose. Most Common Adverse Reactions/Lab Abnormalities The most commonly reported adverse reactions (all grades; grade 3-4) occurring in ≥20% of patients receiving LARTRUVO plus doxorubicin versus doxorubicin alone were nausea (73% vs 52%; 2% vs 3%), fatigue (69% vs 69%; 9% vs 3%), musculoskeletal pain (64% vs 25%; 8% vs 2%), mucositis (53% vs 35%; 3% vs 5%), alopecia (52% vs 40%; 0% vs 0%), vomiting (45% vs 19%; 0% vs 0%), diarrhea (34% vs 23%; 3% vs 0%) decreased appetite (31% vs 20%; 2% vs 0%), abdominal pain (23% vs 14%; 3% vs 0%), neuropathy (22% vs 11%; 0% vs 0%), and headache (20% vs 9%; 0% vs 0%). The most common laboratory abnormalities (all grades; grade 3-4) occurring in ≥20% of patients receiving LARTRUVO plus doxorubicin versus doxorubicin alone were lymphopenia (77% vs 73%; 44% vs 37%), neutropenia (65% vs 63%; 48% vs 38%) and thrombocytopenia (63% vs 44%; 6% vs 11%), hyperglycemia (52% vs 28%; 2% vs 3%), elevated aPTT (33% vs 13%; 5% vs 0%), hypokalemia (21% vs 15%; 8% vs 3%), and hypophosphatemia (21% vs 7%; 5% vs 3%). Use in Specific Populations Lactation: Because of the potential risk for serious adverse reactions in breastfeeding infants, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with LARTRUVO and for at least 3 months following the last dose.

U.S. regulators have agreed to a speedy review of Merck's application to combine its immune system-boosting drug Keytruda with chemotherapy as an initial therapy for advanced lung cancer, the U.S. drugmaker said. Merck said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would decide by May 10 whether to approve its Keytruda combination treatment, sending the company's stock 5 percent higher in early U.S. trading on Wednesday. Shares in companies working on competing immunotherapy-based combinations for lung cancer fell back, with Bristol-Myers Squibb down 2 percent, while Roche and AstraZeneca lost around 0.5 percent. Immunotherapy is revolutionizing some areas of cancer care but giving it on its own only seems to work better than chemotherapy in previously untreated lung cancer patients who have high levels of a protein called PD-L1. Since just a quarter to a third of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients have tumors with at least 50 percent of cells producing PD-L1, around 70 percent of the market is still up for grabs for successful combination products. Analysts at Evercore ISI estimate the market for first-line lung cancer for all patients could be as high as $14 billion. Although Merck presented good results from a mid-stage Phase II trial for its Keytruda-chemotherapy combination at conference in Denmark in October, many analysts had thought it would need to wait for data from a larger Phase III study before filing. "This comes as an important surprise because if FDA approves the application, Merck would suddenly be catapulted ahead of all other (immunotherapy) competitors who are also pursuing competing combination regimens of their own," said Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson. Merck had not previously indicated that it was close to filing for the combination therapy and analysts had been looking for this news toward the end of 2017. RISKS REMAIN Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford agreed the early move was positive for Merck but said an approval was "high risk", given several weaknesses in the small Phase II study. Merck's early move, if successful, could change the dynamics of the marketplace, since it had been assumed that so-called CTLA4 combinations from AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers would be approved before chemotherapy ones. AstraZeneca's closely watched Phase III study of its two drugs durvalumab and tremelimumab is due to report results in the first half of this year, while Bristol-Myers and Roche are also expected to have data during 2017. Merck's Keytruda alone is already approved as an initial, or first-line, treatment for advanced lung cancer in patients whose tumors have a high level of PD-L1 expression, the protein that the drug targets to help the immune system fight cancer. "While Merck is unlikely to durably penetrate this entire population, especially with multiple competing regimens on the horizon, an approval in May would give them a significant first-mover advantage," said Evercore analyst John Scotti.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad FDA accepts Merck application for lung cancer combo therapy By Reuters Published: 18:14 EST, 10 January 2017 | Updated: 18:14 EST, 10 January 2017 e-mail Jan 10 (Reuters) - Merck & Co on Tuesday said the FDA agreed to a speedy review of its application to combine its immunotherapy drug Keytruda with chemotherapy as an initial treatment for advanced lung cancer, potentially giving it a major leg up in the competition for the largest cancer market. Merck said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would decide by May 10 whether to approve the Keytruda combination therapy, sending the drugmaker's shares more than 3 percent higher. "This comes as an important surprise because if FDA approves the application, Merck would suddenly be catapulted ahead of all other (immunotherapy) competitors who are also pursuing competing combination regimens of their own," Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note, mentioning Roche, Bristol-Myers Squibb and AstraZeneca. Merck had not previously indicated that it was close to filing for the combination therapy. Industry analysts had been looking for this news toward the end of the year. Keytruda alone is already approved as an initial, or first-line, treatment for advanced lung cancer in patients whose tumors have a high level of PD-L1 expression, the protein that the drug targets to help the immune system fight cancer. This first application for Keytruda in combination with another medicine would include patients with metastatic or advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) regardless of PD-L1 expression level, opening up a much larger market for the medicine. Patients with high PD-L1 expression account for only about a quarter of all lung cancer patients. Evercore ISI estimated the market for first-line lung cancer for all patients could be as high as $14 billion. "While Merck is unlikely to durably penetrate this entire population, especially with multiple competing regimens on the horizon, an approval in May would give them a significant first-mover advantage," Evercore analyst John Scotti wrote. Keytruda is already also approved to treat advanced melanoma, the deadliest of skin cancers, and head and neck cancers. Merck shares rose to $62 in extended trading from a New York Stock Exchange close at $59.92.

The two new units will be located in close proximity to customers in the Shanghai and Boston metropolitan areas. Each will provide a full range of process development capabilities and services. This includes cell line development services, both upstream and downstream process development, as well as non-GMP clinical production. "We are seeing an increasing global demand for end-to-end process development solutions and Merck offers a one-stop shop for biopharma customers," said Udit Batra, Member of the Merck Executive Board and CEO, Life Science [http://www.merckgroup.com/en/products/life_science/life_science.html]. "This expansion reinforces our position as the premier supplier of all process development and clinical stage manufacturing solutions, materials and services needed for the production of biologics. This is a strategic, high-potential investment for Merck specifically designed to meet customer needs on three continents." Merck's biodevelopment center in Martillac, France, is a fully operational single-use, GMP facility for manufacturing clinical stage batches. Equipped with a full suite of Merck technologies, including the 2000 liter single-use Mobius(®) bioreactor, Martillac offers biopharma companies a complete solution to support their clinical development programs. Merck's end-to-end offering delivers important benefits and addresses key challenges for biopharmaceutical companies at all stages of molecule development and commercialization in any geography.

With an end-to-end approach, Merck can facilitate and accelerate scaling and technical transfer of an entire process to a new location.

Morgan Healthcare Conference. Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) Jan 10, 2017 at 7:23AM Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY) didn't have to wait for its presentation at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference on Monday to make investors happy. Merck (NYSE:MRK) and Incyte announced earlier in the day that a combination of epacadostat and Keytruda would advance to pivotal studies in four additional types of cancer. This news, combined with additional information from Incyte CEO Herve Hoppenot during his J.P. Morgan presentation, appear to make the biotech's prospects brighter than ever before. Image source: Getty Images Epacadostat/Keytruda combo  The announcement that the epacadostat/Keytruda combo would advance to additional late-stage studies spurred Incyte's stock by over 9%. Why such excitement? A look at what the targeted indications are provides the answer. Epacadostat and Keytruda are already in a late-stage study focusing on the treatment of advanced melanoma. Now, Merck and Incyte will move forward with pivotal studies targeting non-small-cell lung cancer, renal-cell carcinoma, bladder cancer, and squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck. The prevalence of these types of cancers means that the market opportunity for epacadostat is now significantly higher than if it only gained approval for melanoma. The potential to be joined at the hip even further with Keytruda is huge. Merck appears to be on a clear trajectory to become the dominant player in the solid-tumor arena with its anti-PD-1 therapy. Combining Keytruda with the possible anti-tumor capabilities of epacadostat could be an even more effective strategy for fighting cancer than either drug as a standalone treatment.   Higher ceiling Incyte had even more good news on Monday. Hoppenot said the biotech now anticipates peak annual revenue of $2 billion for Jakafi. Previously, Incyte had projected peak sales for the drug of around $850 million. This upward revision stems from a couple of factors. First, Hoppenot said frankly that "competition for Jakafi has not been very successful." Second, Incyte is very encouraged about the prospects for the JAK inhibitor in treating graft-versus-host-disease, a frequent complication of allogeneic bone marrow transplants. While the improved guidance for Jakafi wasn't surprising to investors, it's always good to hear the company acknowledge that the ceiling is considerably higher. Even better, Incyte's new peak sales target doesn't include another potential indication: A late-stage study of Jakafi in treating essential thrombocythemia is also scheduled to begin in the near future. Major potential catalysts Incyte also has other potential catalysts in 2017. At the top of the list is the expected launch by Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) of baracitinib in treating rheumatoid arthritis. Incyte partnered with Lilly in 2009 on the development of the JAK inhibitor. The biotech stands to receive $165 million in milestone payments if approved in the U.S. and Europe. plus tiered royalties of up to 20% on global sales of the drug. Hoppenot also mentioned additional clinical trials for baracitinib as potential catalysts for Incyte. A late-stage study evaluating the drug in treating psoriatic arthritis should begin in 2017. Results from a phase 2 study for treatment of atopic dermatitis are expected this year as well. In addition, Incyte has other possible catalysts on the way. Hoppenot highlighted the potential for INCB54828 in targeting FGFR alternations in cancer cells. Incyte expects to report data from dose escalation studies of the pipeline candidate in 2017. Dose escalation data from other experimental cancer drugs are also anticipated later in the year.  Bright future indeed Because of its tremendous success with Jakafi and strong pipeline, Incyte is often mentioned as a potential acquisition target. I suspect the latest news will only fuel the flames of speculation. However, Incyte doesn't need to be acquired for its stock to continue to perform well. The biotech's fortunes will no doubt improve in 2017 with Jakafi's momentum and an expected successful launch of baracitinib. Incyte's future looked bright in 2016. Now it's even brighter.

The expansion, which includes the opening of two new process development centers in the U.S. and China, follows the commercial success of Merck's biodevelopment center in Martillac, France. The two new units will be located in close proximity to customers in the Shanghai and Boston metropolitan areas. Each will provide a full range of process development capabilities and services. This includes cell line development services, both upstream and downstream process development, as well as non-GMP clinical production. "We are seeing an increasing global demand for end-to-end process development solutions and Merck offers a one-stop shop for biopharma customers," said Udit Batra, Member of the Merck Executive Board and CEO, Life Science. "This expansion reinforces our position as the premier supplier of all process development and clinical stage manufacturing solutions, materials and services needed for the production of biologics. This is a strategic, high-potential investment for Merck specifically designed to meet customer needs on three continents." Merck's biodevelopment center in Martillac, France, is a fully operational single-use, GMP facility for manufacturing clinical stage batches. Equipped with a full suite of Merck technologies, including the 2000 liter single-use Mobius® bioreactor, Martillac offers biopharma companies a complete solution to support their clinical development programs. Merck's end-to-end offering delivers important benefits and addresses key challenges for biopharmaceutical companies at all stages of molecule development and commercialization in any geography. In addition to the Mobius® bioreactor, the end-to-end portfolio includes solutions such as Lynx® CDR, Viresolve® Process Area Modules, Pellicon® and Centinel™ Intelligence Virus Defense. Early-stage companies with limited resources and infrastructure benefit from a partner with strong expertise and experience developing processes and GMP clinical manufacturing to help accelerate early clinical development programs. Companies in more advanced stages need to overcome the challenges of moving from late phase clinical development into commercial manufacturing, accelerating availability of affordable life-enhancing drugs. With an end-to-end approach, Merck can facilitate and accelerate scaling and technical transfer of an entire process to a new location.

Morgan Healthcare Conference. Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) Jan 10, 2017 at 7:23AM Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY) didn't have to wait for its presentation at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference on Monday to make investors happy. Merck (NYSE:MRK) and Incyte announced earlier in the day that a combination of epacadostat and Keytruda would advance to pivotal studies in four additional types of cancer. This news, combined with additional information from Incyte CEO Herve Hoppenot during his J.P. Morgan presentation, appear to make the biotech's prospects brighter than ever before. Image source: Getty Images Epacadostat/Keytruda combo  The announcement that the epacadostat/Keytruda combo would advance to additional late-stage studies spurred Incyte's stock by over 9%. Why such excitement? A look at what the targeted indications are provides the answer. Epacadostat and Keytruda are already in a late-stage study focusing on the treatment of advanced melanoma. Now, Merck and Incyte will move forward with pivotal studies targeting non-small-cell lung cancer, renal-cell carcinoma, bladder cancer, and squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck. The prevalence of these types of cancers means that the market opportunity for epacadostat is now significantly higher than if it only gained approval for melanoma. The potential to be joined at the hip even further with Keytruda is huge. Merck appears to be on a clear trajectory to become the dominant player in the solid-tumor arena with its anti-PD-1 therapy. Combining Keytruda with the possible anti-tumor capabilities of epacadostat could be an even more effective strategy for fighting cancer than either drug as a standalone treatment.   Higher ceiling Incyte had even more good news on Monday. Hoppenot said the biotech now anticipates peak annual revenue of $2 billion for Jakafi. Previously, Incyte had projected peak sales for the drug of around $850 million. This upward revision stems from a couple of factors. First, Hoppenot said frankly that "competition for Jakafi has not been very successful." Second, Incyte is very encouraged about the prospects for the JAK inhibitor in treating graft-versus-host-disease, a frequent complication of allogeneic bone marrow transplants. While the improved guidance for Jakafi wasn't surprising to investors, it's always good to hear the company acknowledge that the ceiling is considerably higher. Even better, Incyte's new peak sales target doesn't include another potential indication: A late-stage study of Jakafi in treating essential thrombocythemia is also scheduled to begin in the near future. Major potential catalysts Incyte also has other potential catalysts in 2017. At the top of the list is the expected launch by Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) of baracitinib in treating rheumatoid arthritis. Incyte partnered with Lilly in 2009 on the development of the JAK inhibitor. The biotech stands to receive $165 million in milestone payments if approved in the U.S. and Europe. plus tiered royalties of up to 20% on global sales of the drug. Hoppenot also mentioned additional clinical trials for baracitinib as potential catalysts for Incyte. A late-stage study evaluating the drug in treating psoriatic arthritis should begin in 2017. Results from a phase 2 study for treatment of atopic dermatitis are expected this year as well. In addition, Incyte has other possible catalysts on the way. Hoppenot highlighted the potential for INCB54828 in targeting FGFR alternations in cancer cells. Incyte expects to report data from dose escalation studies of the pipeline candidate in 2017. Dose escalation data from other experimental cancer drugs are also anticipated later in the year.  Bright future indeed Because of its tremendous success with Jakafi and strong pipeline, Incyte is often mentioned as a potential acquisition target. I suspect the latest news will only fuel the flames of speculation. However, Incyte doesn't need to be acquired for its stock to continue to perform well. The biotech's fortunes will no doubt improve in 2017 with Jakafi's momentum and an expected successful launch of baracitinib. Incyte's future looked bright in 2016. Now it's even brighter.

The healthcare tech start-up backed by Unicorn India Ventures and Patni Group’s Currae Healthtech Fund will provide Merck with clear visibility of market inventory and ensure availability of its products within the warehouses and markets. The platform will help Merck avoid stock-out scenarios, thus, significantly reducing loss of sales. Speaking to DNA Money, Pharmarack Technologies P Ltd CEO Pradyumn Singh said the company will be automating the entire sales order operations of the pharma giant’s pan India distributors network. “Our fully automated platform will enable MSD replace the current sales order process, which is manual and complex,” said Singh, adding that Merck is the start-up’s first MNC client. The Pharmarack SaaS platform was initially only made available to pharmaceutical industry distributors (carrying and forwarding agents) and could be accessed on mobile (iOS, Android and Microsoft) as well as desktop (through its website). Merck, which currently has 2,000 distributors, will now use the platform to automate the orders placing process for medicines which were earlier possible only via a company representative. The manual system of receiving orders and processing them, Singh said, gives rise to many inefficiencies, time-consuming delays and repetitive process. “Our SaaS-based platform will benefit Merck and its distributors by enabling them to place an order online and immediately get a confirmation of the shipment along with other details like size and delivery of shipment, thus, helping the distributors plan their supply chain efficiently and well in advance,” he said. The start-up is currently in negotiations with a few other pharmaceutical companies for a similar arrangement and is likely to close the talks in a few months from now. In terms of existing users, the company already has 650 distributors and 10,000 pharmaceutical retailers on board.

Five years after marriage, she was yet to conceive. She was  subjected to dehumanising treatments by her husband’s family. Nkemdili’s mother-inlaw suddenly became a thorn in her flesh, daily raining abuses on her, calling her all sorts of names, and even accusing her of being a witch that eats up the babies in her womb. That’s not all. At other times, Nkemdili’s mother-inlaw accused her of ruining her womb.  This went on and on for years, that Nkemdili’s husband became pressurised by the mother to get a second wife for himself. The claims were that Nkemdili was to be blamed for her inability to conceive. However, on the advice of a neighbour, Nkemdili and her husband, sought medical attention, and lo and behold, it was discovered that it had not all been Nkemdili’s fault but her husband’s, as he was diagnosed to have low sperm count. Today, there are millions of Nigerian women suffering these forms of dehumanisation due to their inability to conceive, and in most cases, the fault is usually laid on their doorsteps, without the slightest knowledge that the men could be the cause of the problems. A recent statistics by the World Health Organisation showed that  more than 180 million couples (1 in every 4 couples) in developing countries suffer from primary or secondary infertility. WHO says infertility in Africa is caused by infections in over 85 percent women compared to 33 percent worldwide which emphasize the importance of prevention programmes in Africa. It’s against this backdrop that world’s foremost pharmaceutical and chemical company, Merck, launched in Nigeria, its “Merck More than a Mother” initiative aimed at combating infertility and the stigmatization associated with it in Nigeria. The launch which took place first in Lagos and then in Abuja, brought together women leaders, policy makers, parliamentarians, academics, fertility experts among others to chart the way forward towards combating, identifying and implementing strategies to improve access to effective, safe and regulated fertility care in Nigeria and to define interventions to decrease social suffering arising from infertility and childlessness. The mind-engaging discussion at the launch included  panelists the Chairman, Senate Committee on Health, Senator Lanre Tejuosho; member, Parliament of Kenya, Hon. Joyce Lay; President, Africa Fertility Society, AFS, Professor Oladapo Ashiru; former President, International Federation of Fertility Societies, IFFS, Prof. Joe Simpson, President, Nigeria Reproductive Society, Dr. Faye Iketubosin;  Head, Intercontinental Region, Merck, Yiannis Vlontzos; amond a host of others. Experts speak Speaking at the launch, in Lagos, Chief Social Officer, Merck, Dr. Rasha Kelej, said the “Merck More than a Mother” initiative is imperative in Africa as the consequences of infertility are much more dramatic in developing countries and can create more wide ranging social and cultural problems compared to Western societies, particularly for women. Kelej said: “A central difficulty associated with infertility is that it can transform from an acute, private distress into a harsh, public stigma with complex and devastating consequences. “In some cultures, childless women still suffer discrimination, stigma and ostracism. An inability to have a child or to become pregnant can result in being greatly isolated, disinherited or assaulted. This may result in divorce or physical and psychological violence. “Through the “Merck More than a Mother” initiative, all stakeholders together including women leaders, policy makers, parliamentarians, academia, fertility experts, community and media will challenge the perception of infertile women, their roles and worth in the society, both within and beyond the medical profession in order to achieve a systemic shift in the current culture of gender discrimination in the context of fertility care in African societies and address solutions for change of mindset and upgrading the health care services.” On his part, Senator Tejuosho affirmed that the stigmatization of women and mothers who have infertility challenges, require the much needed attention, saying. “It’s a fact that out of four Nigerian couples, we have a couple with infertility challenges. This statistics means that infertility needs urgent attention and we need to focus on how we can make health institutions accessible for infertility management. “Most importantly, there is a lot of stigma against women with infertility challenges in Nigeria. We want to stop it. We also want to increase the advocacy against the notion that it’s only the women that suffer infertility. People must know that 50 percent of infertility issues are caused by men.” Similarly, Infertility Advocate and Member, Kenyan Parliament, Hon. Joyce Lay disclosed that what inspired her to lead the campaign against stigmatizing women with infertility issues in Kenya and Africa was because she had a personal experience, having had difficulty having a child after she got married. Lay said: “Lack of information as well as lack of access to better medical and healthcare services contributes largely to cases of infertility in Africa. As a member of parliament, I discover in Africa, governments commit funds in the budget for family planning programmes, but none for infertility. So, I have used this opportunity to ensure that the Kenyan government come on board to realize that infertility is a big problem and we all must be involved.”   Okogba View all posts by Okogba → Previous Post Conjoined twins share single body, two heads in Mexico Next Post Red meat intake linked to common bowel condition Disclaimer Comments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.

It was health care. And shares of U.S. pharmaceutical companies promptly fell, dropping by an average range of about 3% to 5%. "We've got to get our drug industry back,” he said. “Our drug industry has been disastrous. They're leaving left and right. They supply our drugs, but they don't make them here, to a large extent. And the other thing we have to do is create new bidding procedures for the drug industry because they're getting away with murder. Pharma ... has a lot of ... lobbyists and a lot of power, and there's very little bidding on drugs. We're the largest buyer of drugs in the world, and yet we don't bid properly, and we're going to start bidding and we're going to save billions of dollars over a period of time." The chart The best way to illustrate investors’ reaction is with the annotated chart of the Direxion Daily S&P Biotech Bear 3X Shares LABD, -2.53% a leveraged inverse biotech ETF. Please click here for the chart. The chart shows that immediately after Trump’s comment, the inverse ETF jumped about 12%. (The ETF rises at three times the rate of the underlying stocks’ decline.) Read: How Trump’s presser threatened to deflate his own stock-market rally The chart also shows the so-called VUD indicator, which measures true supply and demand in real time, and is calculated from every single trade on every exchange. This shows mostly buying demand but there are a few non-believers selling into strength, as shown on the chart. How to be prudent Two days ago, I wrote an article titled “Five unpopular, but prudent, things for investors to do near Dow 20,000.” To be consistently successful, investors need to anticipate events and be proactive. One of the prudent actions mentioned in the article was to sell pharmaceutical stocks. I wrote: "Americans pay a lot more for drugs than people in other countries. That's why you ought to sell large U.S.-based companies. After all, they are at risk of Trump tweets. Examples include Pfizer PFE, -0.25% Johnson & Johnson JNJ, -0.02% Merck MRK, +0.21% Bristol-Myers Squibb BMY, -0.58% and Eli Lilly LLY, +0.32% " Popular pharma and biotech ETFs to sell Pharma and biotech ETFs have until now been popular. So consider selling these seven ETFs: PowerShares Dynamic Pharmaceuticals Portfolio ETF PJP, +0.33% iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF IHE, +0.45% SPDR S&P Pharmaceuticals ETF XPH, +0.25% VanEck Vectors Pharmaceutical ETF PPH, +0.32% iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology IBB, +0.39% SPDR S&P Biotech XBI, +0.81% and VanEck Vectors Biotech BBH, +0.22% Inverse ETFs to buy Investors with an aggressive bent may consider buying inverse pharma and biotech ETFs. The Arora Report Portfolios contain ProShares UltraShort Nasdaq Biotech BIS, -0.60% and Direxion Daily S&P Biotech Bear 3X Shares LABD, -2.53% Short-selling pharma Short selling — betting on a decline in prices — is highly risky and primarily used by professionals. Only individual investors with ample experience with short selling should consider shorting pharma stocks. As a cautionary note, it is important to attach hard stops to any short orders to limit losses. As an example, today at 9:36 a.m., about two hours before Trump's press conference, The Arora Report gave a call to short sell Merck, anticipating that the president-elect may say something about pharma. At the time, Merck’s stock was up about 5% on the news that Merck’s Keytruda was granted priority review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Keytruda combines new immunotherapy with traditional chemotherapy for lung cancer. On the news, the stock of competitor Bristol-Myers fell. In our analysis, the advantage gained by Merck is temporary, and Bristol-Myers is likely to catch up. This analysis provided an opportunity to short a pharma stock at a higher price and make even more money.

Investors will closely watch Trump's speech, looking for clues on where his priorities as the new president lie, after taking office on Jan. 20 and how he plans boost economic growth. Trump's election in November sparked a record-setting rally. But, investors now want evidence on if and how he keeps his campaign-trail promises of stimulating the economy though increased public spending, tax cuts and repatriating U.S. companies' funds from overseas. The dollar, which has also basked in Trump's victory, rose to 102.79. However, concerns over some of his protectionist statements have kept investors wary. "I worry that it is going to be more about the distractions that he will address as opposed to the pro-growth policies and that is going to be the important factor for investors," said Mark Heppenstall, chief investment officer of Penn Mutual Asset Management. Oil prices also helped keep the equity market afloat, rising for the first time in three days after Saudi Arabia provided details of a February supply cut to some of its Asian customers. Investors are also looking out to the corporate earnings season, which kicks off with big banks on Friday, to judge if financial results can support the lofty valuations Wall Street is trading at. S&P 500 companies' earnings are estimated to have risen 5.8 percent in the fourth quarter, the best in three years, largely helped by financials stocks, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the healthcare sector's 0.23 percent rise the biggest boost. The sector is set for its seventh straight day of gains. Merck surged 5 percent to $62.91 after the FDA agreed to a speedy review of the company's application to combine immunotherapy with other drugs to treat lung cancer. The stock gave the biggest push to the S&P and the Dow. AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers, which are also developing similar therapies, dropped 1.3 percent and 2.7percent, respectively. Rite Aid rose 3.8 percent to $8.64 after the NY Post reported that the drugstore operator's deal to be acquired by Walgreens would be approved this month. Walgreens rose 2.6 percent.

Morgan Healthcare Conference. Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) Jan 11, 2017 at 9:41AM Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) shareholders were understandably disappointed in August when results from a late-stage study of Opdivo as a first-line lung cancer treatment were announced. Opdivo's failure in that study knocked more than 30% off Bristol-Myers Squibb's market cap, although it has rebounded somewhat since then. On Tuesday, CEO Giovanni Caforio spoke at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. For shareholders wanting reassurance that the company was still on the right track, Caforio provided plenty of reasons to be confident about the future. Here are three charts from Caforio's presentation that every Bristol-Myers Squibb shareholder needs to see.  Image source: Getty Images. Some perspective It's easy to forget just how successful Opdivo has been in light of the poor results from the first-line lung cancer study. Caforio mentioned that that the drug has received approval for 10 indications in just two years. The significance of that achievement might not register at first, but consider that Roche's (NASDAQOTH:RHHBY) pioneering cancer drug Avastin has only nine approved indications -- but it took 11 years to get all of them.  Of course, gaining approval for indications is one thing. Turning those approvals into commercial success is another. On that front, Opdivo (and BMS's immuno-oncology program in general) has performed quite nicely. Take a look at the following sales trends from 2016. Image source: Bristol-Myers Squibb. There's no doubt that Merck (NYSE:MRK) will gain ground this year with Keytruda. The same is true for Roche with Tecentriq. Caforio acknowledged in his comments at the J.P. Morgan conference that there would definitely be challenges in the lung cancer market in 2017. As more patients are tested for expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), sales for Keytruda and Tecentriq will grow at Opdivo's expense. Merck and Roche will likely open up a lead over Bristol-Myers Squibb at least in the short term. Combos are key Caforio was quick to point out, though, that the real opportunity in treating lung cancer is with combination therapies rather than monotherapies. BMS saw this with melanoma, with combo regimens quickly becoming the standard of care. Caforio expects history to repeat itself with the lung cancer market. That brings us to the second chart that Bristol-Myers Squibb shareholders will want to see. The drugmaker is on the way to becoming a "combos-R-us" for oncology with Opdivo. Image source: Bristol-Myers Squibb. This chart shows 14 data readouts over the next 24 months for 10 different types of cancer. And these are all late-stage studies. Positive results could lead to possible regulatory approval. That's what Bristol-Myers Squibb is banking on. More than Opdivo Opdivo seems to get all of the attention these days, but remember that Bristol-Myers Squibb has another enormously successful drug with significant growth potential. Sales for Eliquis came in just under $2.4 billion in the first nine months of 2016 -- only slightly behind Opdivo. That figure nearly doubled sales for the anticoagulant in the prior-year period. Caforio talked briefly about how Eliquis continues to gain market share. The following chart (actually two charts in one) shows just how much market share the drug is winning. Image source: Bristol-Myers Squibb. A little explanation of these charts is in order. "NBRx" on the chart on the left refers to new-to-brand prescriptions, which count prescriptions for patients who have never been on the brand before. "NOAC" stands for new oral anti-coagulant, while "AFib + VTE-Tx" refers to the atrial fibrillation and  venous thromboembolism (VTE) prescription drug market. "TRx" on the right chart y-axis legend simply means total prescription share. These charts show that Eliquis rapidly surpassed Pradaxa and Savaysa in market share among all prescribing physicians. It took a little longer to do so for Xarelto. As of late 2016, Eliquis had gained more market share than any of these drugs as well as topping longtime anti-coagulant therapy Warfarin. The bottom line is that Eliquis is and should continue to be a big winner for BMS. Looking ahead Caforio said that Bristol-Myers Squibb's pipeline is as strong or perhaps even stronger than it's ever been. He wasn't only referring to the many late-stage programs like the Opdivo combo studies. BMS has several phase 1 and phase 2 studies in therapeutic areas with opportunities for significant growth, including cardiovascular diseases, immunoscience, and fibrotic diseases. While threats from Merck and Roche might dominate discussions about Bristol-Myers Squibb in 2017, it's important to know that the company's long-term prospects remain quite good. Giovanni Caforio's charts from the J.P. Morgan conference help show why. Keith Speights has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

"We have to get our drug industry coming back. Our drug industry has gotten disastrous. They're leaving left and right," Trump said at his first news conference since winning the U.S. election. The Nasdaq composite fell after Trump made his remarks, as the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) fell 3 percent. The tech-heavy index, however, ended the session 0.2 percent higher at a record closing level. The S&P 500 advanced 0.3 percent, shrugging off a 1 percent decline in health care. Energy stocks led the way in the S&P, rising 1.2 percent. Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab, said the stock market has largely given Trump the benefit of the doubt. He said that would change after the inauguration. "After that point, his actions will become more important versus what he says," he said. The Dow Jones industrial average closed about 99 points higher, with Goldman Sachs and IBM contributing the most gains. The blue-chips index briefly turned lower after Trump's remarks on the pharmaceutical industry. Dow intraday chartSource: FactSet Investors came into the news conference looking for clues about his proposed policies. Stocks in the U.S. have rallied sharply since Trump's victory, amid hope that the incoming administration will cut corporate taxes, deregulate certain sectors and inject fiscal stimulus into the economy. Trump's news conference concluded without him providing details on these policies. "We need some concrete numbers. We haven't sold off because there hasn't been a reason to do so. That said, you're dealing with some pretty nervous longs here," said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. "Our hope is that these three policies will be enacted and a more pragmatic approach will be taken to trade and immigration," said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. He also said he expects Trump to wait until the after the inauguration to provide more guidance on his policies. That said, some of the president-elect's tweets have raised concerns among investors. Since Nov. 8, Trump has taken to Twitter to criticize companies that planned to send jobs overseas rather than create them in the United States. He has also threatened to levy a high border tax against those firms. Spencer Platt | Getty Images Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange "What's interesting about Trump is he's sort of managed to work around the traditional news cycle," said Tom Siomades, head of Hartford Funds Investment Consulting Group. "The market is also grappling with that, too." "Companies like Airbus and Boeing will not only have to think about their input cost, but they will also have to pay attention to (the) PR perspective," said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets. Separately, Trump's nominee for secretary of State Rex Tillerson, testified on Capitol Hill at his confirmation hearing. Tillerson, the former Exxon Mobil CEO, has raised concerns among most of the Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Republican Marco Rubio, given his lack of public service experience and close ties to Russia. "There's so much that could come out from those hearings," said Hartford Funds' Siomades. "This cast of characters is not well known, and the market could react to that." Wall Street also braced itself for the start of earnings season, as banking giants JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, among others, are slated to report quarterly results on Friday. "I think we're going to get a good earnings season," said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank. "The question is can the market sustain the euphoria with what could still be considered relatively modest earnings growth." In the bond market, meanwhile, U.S. Treasurys traded higher after Trump's news conference, with the benchmark 10-year note yield falling to 2.365 percent and the two-year note yield holding near 1.18 percent. The U.S. dollar fell 0.2 percent against a basket of currencies after trading higher, with the euro near $1.057 and the yen around 115.38. The pound briefly fell around 1 percent against the dollar, breaking below $1.21. Sterling last traded at $1.22. Overseas, European equities traded higher, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index advancing 0.23 percent. In Asia, Chinese stocks closed lower overnight, with the Shanghai composite dropping 0.79 percent, while the Japanese Nikkei 225 recorded a gain of 0.33 percent.

Merck said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would decide by May 10 whether to approve the Keytruda combination therapy, sending the drugmaker's shares more than 3 percent higher. "This comes as an important surprise because if FDA approves the application, Merck would suddenly be catapulted ahead of all other (immunotherapy) competitors who are also pursuing competing combination regimens of their own," Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note, mentioning Roche, Bristol-Myers Squibb and AstraZeneca. Merck had not previously indicated that it was close to filing for the combination therapy. Industry analysts had been looking for this news toward the end of the year. Keytruda alone is already approved as an initial, or first-line, treatment for advanced lung cancer in patients whose tumors have a high level of PD-L1 expression, the protein that the drug targets to help the immune system fight cancer. More on this... Fox & Friends: Janice Dean discusses FDA delay of promising MS drug FDA probes dangers of exploding e-cigarette batteries Obstetricians balk at FDA warning on anesthesia in pregnant women This first application for Keytruda in combination with another medicine would include patients with metastatic or advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) regardless of PD-L1 expression level, opening up a much larger market for the medicine. Patients with high PD-L1 expression account for only about a quarter of all lung cancer patients. Evercore ISI estimated the market for first-line lung cancer for all patients could be as high as $14 billion. "While Merck is unlikely to durably penetrate this entire population, especially with multiple competing regimens on the horizon, an approval in May would give them a significant first-mover advantage," Evercore analyst John Scotti wrote. Keytruda is already also approved to treat advanced melanoma, the deadliest of skin cancers, and head and neck cancers. Merck shares rose to $62 in extended trading from a New York Stock Exchange close at $59.92.

The U.S. President-elect, who takes office on Jan. 20, is scheduled to speak in New York at 11:00 a.m. ET (1600 GMT). Trump's election in November sparked a record-setting rally. But, investors now want evidence on if and how he keeps his campaign-trail promises of stimulating the economy though increased public spending, tax cuts and repatriating U.S. companies' funds from overseas. The dollar, which has also basked in Trump's victory, rose to 102.53. However, concerns over some of his protectionist statements have kept investors wary. Oil prices also helped keep the equity market afloat, rising for the first time in three days after Saudi Arabia provided details of a February supply cut to some of its Asian customers. "The overall technical picture for the stock market remains firm and we look for commodities to be the market leaders of the day, thereby, keeping the markets upward trend in place," Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial, said in a note. Investors are also closely watching the corporate earnings season, which kicks off with big banks on Friday, to see if financial results can support the lofty valuations Wall Street is trading at. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is estimated to have risen 5.8 percent in the fourth quarter - the best in three years - largely helped by financials stocks, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. At 9:37 a.m. ET (1437 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 26.22 points, or 0.13 percent, at 19,881.75 and the S&P 500 was down 0.53 points, or 0.02 percent, at 2,268.37. The Nasdaq was down 1.58 points, or 0.03 percent, at 5,550.24. Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the healthcare sector's 0.25 percent rise the biggest boost. The sector is set for its seventh straight day of gains. Merck surged nearly 5 percent to $62.89 after the FDA agreed to a speedy review of the company's application to combine immunotherapy with other drugs to treat lung cancer. The stock gave the biggest push to the S&P and the Dow. AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers, which are also developing similar therapies, dropped 0.7 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively. Rite Aid rose 3.8 percent to $8.64 after the NY Post reported that the drugstore operator's deal to be acquired by Walgreens would be approved this month. Walgreens rose 1.7 percent. New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley is expected to speak on banking regulations at 01:20 p.m. ET. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,351 to 1,179. On the Nasdaq, 1,263 issues fell and 873 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed five new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 31 new highs and six new lows.

He canceled a previously scheduled press conference in December where he was expected to outline how he'd deal with conflicts of interest arising from his sprawling business dealings. Trump is also likely to face questions about allegations that Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about him. His comments at the conference -- much like his tweets -- will be closely dissected and have the potential to move markets around the world. 2. Rex Tillerson's confirmation: The U.S. Senate will hold a hearing today on the nomination of former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson to be the next secretary of state. The confirmation hearing around 9:15 a.m. ET is likely to focus on the oilman's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Tillerson is likely to be quizzed on climate change and energy policy as well. There's also a confirmation hearing scheduled on Wednesday for Elaine Chao, Trump's pick to lead the Transportation Department. 3. Premarket movers -- Merck, ADM: Shares in drug company Merck are getting a boost premarket after it revealed late Tuesday that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is reviewing a license for a lung cancer treatment, Keytruda. It's going through an "accelerated approval" program. On the flip side, the agribusiness Archer Daniels Midland is seeing shares fall premarket after the company announced it signed a deal to buy a Kansas-based pet-food producer Crosswind Industries. This is the second big pet-related takeover this week. Candy-bar maker Mars announced on Monday that it's buying VCA, a pet health care business, in a multi-billion dollar deal. 4. Stocks to watch -- Samsung, Volkswagen, Sainsbury: Shares in Samsung performed well Wednesday despite news about its links to a growing corruption scandal. Prosecutors have named the heir to the Samsung empire as a suspect in a massive corruption scandal that has rocked South Korea. Samsung shares closed with a 2.8% gain. Volkswagen stock is also buoyant in Germany after the automaker announced it's negotiating a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department that would require it to pay $4.3 billion in fines and plead guilty to criminal wrongdoing over its diesel emission scandal. Shares in J Sainsbury are rallying in London after the grocery chain released a well-received business update for the holiday season. 5. Global market overview: U.S. stock futures are holding steady after a mixed trading day on Tuesday. The Nasdaq pushed to fresh record highs yesterday while the other two indexes didn't make many major moves. European trading is relatively muted right now while Asian markets are closing the day with mixed results. 6.

U.S. regulators have agreed to a speedy review of Merck's application to combine its immune system-boosting drug Keytruda with chemotherapy as an initial therapy for advanced lung cancer, the U.S. drugmaker said. Merck said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would decide by May 10 whether to approve its Keytruda combination treatment, sending the company's stock 5 percent higher in early U.S. trading on Wednesday. Shares in companies working on competing immunotherapy-based combinations for lung cancer fell back, with Bristol-Myers Squibb down 2 percent, while Roche and AstraZeneca lost around 0.5 percent. Immunotherapy is revolutionizing some areas of cancer care but giving it on its own only seems to work better than chemotherapy in previously untreated lung cancer patients who have high levels of a protein called PD-L1. Since just a quarter to a third of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients have tumors with at least 50 percent of cells producing PD-L1, around 70 percent of the market is still up for grabs for successful combination products. Analysts at Evercore ISI estimate the market for first-line lung cancer for all patients could be as high as $14 billion. Although Merck presented good results from a mid-stage Phase II trial for its Keytruda-chemotherapy combination at conference in Denmark in October, many analysts had thought it would need to wait for data from a larger Phase III study before filing. "This comes as an important surprise because if FDA approves the application, Merck would suddenly be catapulted ahead of all other (immunotherapy) competitors who are also pursuing competing combination regimens of their own," said Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson. Merck had not previously indicated that it was close to filing for the combination therapy and analysts had been looking for this news toward the end of 2017. RISKS REMAIN Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford agreed the early move was positive for Merck but said an approval was "high risk", given several weaknesses in the small Phase II study. Merck's early move, if successful, could change the dynamics of the marketplace, since it had been assumed that so-called CTLA4 combinations from AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers would be approved before chemotherapy ones. AstraZeneca's closely watched Phase III study of its two drugs durvalumab and tremelimumab is due to report results in the first half of this year, while Bristol-Myers and Roche are also expected to have data during 2017. Merck's Keytruda alone is already approved as an initial, or first-line, treatment for advanced lung cancer in patients whose tumors have a high level of PD-L1 expression, the protein that the drug targets to help the immune system fight cancer. "While Merck is unlikely to durably penetrate this entire population, especially with multiple competing regimens on the horizon, an approval in May would give them a significant first-mover advantage," said Evercore analyst John Scotti.

Merck said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would decide by May 10 whether to approve the Keytruda combination therapy, sending the drugmaker's shares more than 3 percent higher. "This comes as an important surprise because if FDA approves the application, Merck would suddenly be catapulted ahead of all other (immunotherapy) competitors who are also pursuing competing combination regimens of their own," Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note, mentioning Roche, Bristol-Myers Squibb and AstraZeneca. Merck had not previously indicated that it was close to filing for the combination therapy. Industry analysts had been looking for this news toward the end of the year. Keytruda alone is already approved as an initial, or first-line, treatment for advanced lung cancer in patients whose tumors have a high level of PD-L1 expression, the protein that the drug targets to help the immune system fight cancer. This first application for Keytruda in combination with another medicine would include patients with metastatic or advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) regardless of PD-L1 expression level, opening up a much larger market for the medicine. Patients with high PD-L1 expression account for only about a quarter of all lung cancer patients. Evercore ISI estimated the market for first-line lung cancer for all patients could be as high as $14 billion. "While Merck is unlikely to durably penetrate this entire population, especially with multiple competing regimens on the horizon, an approval in May would give them a significant first-mover advantage," Evercore analyst John Scotti wrote. Keytruda is already also approved to treat advanced melanoma, the deadliest of skin cancers, and head and neck cancers. Merck shares rose to $62 in extended trading from a New York Stock Exchange close at $59.92.

Bypassing sporting stadiums and race-car tracks, Biden’s first official stop in the world’s sporting capital was to open a A$1 billion ($737 million) cancer center. As head of America’s cancer “moonshot” initiative, and having lost his son Beau to brain cancer, Biden has spent the last year of his term exploring ways to “end cancer as we know it.” That his quest took him 10,000 miles to the Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre is an endorsement of Australia’s medical-science prowess and a new plan to expand its reach. Joe Biden in Melbourne. Photographer: Tracey Nearmy/Pool via Getty Images Mining has been the growth engine for Australia’s economy for years. As demand for the nation’s mineral resources declines, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is boosting life-science research funds, offering tax breaks and wooing international talent to exploit the scientific capital that’s enabled the country to claim more than a dozen Nobel laureates. “We were collecting pieces of intellectual property and just handing it over – ‘here you are’ – to investors,” recalls Amanda Caples of her time working in drug development in Melbourne in the early 2000s. At the time, the life sciences industry was following mining’s path of “digging it up and selling it,” she said. Shifting Aspirations Now, as lead scientist in Victoria, the state of which Melbourne is the capital, Caples has seen “a shift in aspirations,” she said. “We’re adding the ‘on-shore processing’” by advancing research beyond the discovery stage. Doing so requires funds that often eluded inventors. Cervical cancer vaccines, for example, rely on groundbreaking research on the human papilloma virus from doctors in Brisbane, who collaborated with Melbourne-based CSL Ltd. on early studies. The shots were taken through late-stage clinical tests and commercialized abroad by pharmaceutical giants Merck & Co. and GlaxoSmithKline Plc. Turnbull, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive, aims to avoid missing such money-making opportunities with the launch this month of A$250 million for a Biomedical Translational Fund. The funds were allocated in December to three venture capital firms:  Brandon Capital Partners, OneVentures Management and BioScience Managers. The investments will help companies take their promising treatment candidates further along the three-stage clinical trial process instead of being forced to license them at early development stages to companies with more money, said Chris Nave, managing director of Melbourne-based Brandon Capital. Nave’s fund received close to half of the government’s allocation -- A$115 million -- which is being matched by its pension fund investors. ‘It’s transformative’ “For the first time, the Australian biotech industry has access to sufficient amounts of capital to support late stage development,” said Nave, a former scientist who switched to helping universities garner funding from external investors. “It’s transformative.” “There’s a real opportunity that the next Genentech or Amgen will be built in Australia,” Nave said, referring to the U.S. biotechnology giants. The Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne. Source: Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre The nation is good at generating science-based intellectual property, for which there are few local competitors at least for now, he said. “We’re not all walking down the same corridors, fighting for deals here," he added. The same advantage is felt at the headquarters of CSL, Asia-Pacific’s biggest drugmaker by market value, which is located across a park from the cancer center Biden opened in Melbourne’s medical precinct. “In some respects I’m the big fish here - if somebody has something they come to me," said Paul Perreault, CSL’s chief executive officer, referring to researchers presenting the company with their discoveries. “If I was in the U.S., there are so many competitors, it might be like CS-who?” Penicillin to Pacemakers New inventions are becoming more important in a country whose scientific feats include pioneering the medical use of penicillin, spray-on skin, electronic pacemakers, the bionic ear, and the ultrasound scanner. A 25-year economic expansion has faltered in recent years amid the collapse of a once-in-a-century mining boom, prompting Turnbull to turn instead to an “ideas boom” for growth. An example Deborah Rathjen, managing director of Bionomics Ltd., gives suggests that protecting intellectual property rights attached to those ideas may be a bigger challenge for Australian researchers. In 1989, she and a colleague applied for a patent for the world-beating discovery of how an inflammation-signalling protein called tumor necrosis factor worked and how it could be countered with an antibody – a finding that later led to the development of arthritis and autoimmune treatments Humira and Remicade, whose combined sales top $20 billion a year. When drug developers sought to challenge that patent, Rathjen asked Peptech to defend it. ‘Business Savvy’ Senior management initially balked at wrangling with the pharmaceutical gorillas behind the medicines, prompting a boardroom showdown in which Rathjen pledged to fund the lawsuit herself. Peptech finally agreed to pursue the matter and won, eventually earning hundreds of millions of dollars in royalties, she said. It was an example of almost being defeated by “groups with much more business savvy,” Rathjen said in a phone interview from Adelaide. “We needed someone to champion it, and realized we could make a lot of money out of this – investing in research, patent filings.” Tenacity has served Rathjen well. Excited by her experience at Peptech, she accepted an offer to run Bionomics in June 2000, about six months after the biotech company debuted on the Australian Stock Exchange following a A$7 million initial public offering. Bionomics now has a market capitalization of A$180 million, a potential bowel-cancer therapy in early stage patient studies, and strategic partnerships with Merck for promising therapies for pain and cognition. While local health care indexes have outperformed the bourse’s benchmark in the past decade -- buoyed in part by the rise in CSL’s share price -- valuations are still lower than global counterparts. Click here for a story on how CSL Ltd. has risen to become the most valuable drugmaker in Asia-Pacific. Arbitraging Assets George Syrmalis is the founder and chief executive officer of The iQ Group, which invests in early research stage startups in Australia, with the intention to help them trade their shares domestically. Post ASX listing and once the company attains significant research milestones, they cross-list the company on NASDAQ in the U.S. This usually results in a higher valuation of the asset, Syrmalis said. By his estimates, early-stage Australian assets are discounted by about 30 to 50 percent compared to similar investments in the U.S., he said. That differential may narrow, thanks to advocates of Australian medical research, like Biden. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.

Ogg January 10, 2017 7:45 am EST Print Email Tweet With 2017 well underway, the investing community needs to consider what happened in 2016, and they need to consider beyond the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) hitting 20,000 for what may come ahead. The Dow rose 13.4% to 19,762.60 in 2016, outperforming a 9.5% rise in the S&P 500 and a 7.5% gain for the Nasdaq. This ended up being quite close to the 19,700 bull/bear projection from the start of 2016 — and now investors should consider why the same methodology is pointing to the Dow rising about 8.4% to 21,422. What matters with the post-election rally at its sails on and the pro-business policies expected under a Trump presidency is that 2017 could be another solid year for equity investors. The DJIA bull-bear projection of 21,422 would be short of the preliminary look of 22,000 seen at the end of December, but another 8.4% gain likely would be more than welcome. Investors are already expecting two or three rate hikes by the Federal Reserve in 2017. The 10-year Treasury went out with a yield of 2.44% in 2016, and the 30-year Treasury closed out 2016 with a yield of 3.06%. On the last day of 2015, the 10-year yield was 2.27% and the 30-year yield was 3.01%. Still, the lows of the year were 1.34% for the 10-year and 2.1% for the 30-year. On top of tax reform and overseas cash repatriation, companies are expected to benefit from lower regulatory spending. All of this, along with an “America first” mentality, are expected to add up to higher earnings for companies in 2017. Also a climate is being set for higher dividends and continued share buybacks, if hundreds of billions of dollars were to magically be brought back into America. One thing that ought to be kept in mind is that investors should not expect the post-election rally to continue in a straight line all year. That post-election rally was too big to ignore, but it is very likely that some of the gains for the start of 2017 were pulled into late 2016, based on how explosive that rally was. As a reminder, markets sold off steadily at the start of 2016 after the late 2015 gains stole from the coming year. At one point in early 2016, the S&P 500 Index was down far more than the 10% threshold to mark a correction. Also, a year ago it was the case that analysts were calling for S&P 500 earnings to rise almost 10%, only to find earnings remain flat. The S&P was also valued at roughly 17 times forward earnings at the end of 2016, a more lofty valuation than most investors would prefer. So, we are past the 19,700 mark, and Dow 20,000 may just be a mental line. This 21,422 Dow target for 2017 is derived using the 12-month price target consensus (mean) from Thomson Reuters using the bullish and bearish targets. We then add in the dividend yield at the end of each year, without considering dividend hikes expected in the coming year, for a snapshot total return calculation for each of the 30 Dow components. We then average out the expected total return of all 30 Dow components, without using the weighting of each component, and that is used to calculate the expected return. The assumption is that analysts will not get each Dow target right, but if you give them 30 tries and use an average then they can get their calls right. Before getting into 8.4% projected upside for stocks, there are some risks that must be considered. First and foremost, the Dow’s rally from November 9 to December 30 was so large that it may have stolen some of 2017’s gains. Stocks tied to financial, energy, infrastructure and consumer goods rallied so much that some tempering of real upside expectations seems merited. Washington, D.C., also has a history of infighting that makes some of the upside in various proposed policy changes priced for perfection, and perfection and politics rarely is the outcome. Earnings growth could be short of expectations, and there are still mixed economic reports on just how strong growth can be. Is 3% to 4% GDP growth realistic over and over after seven years of recovery? Currency risk from a strong dollar and the poor economic trends of many key growth economies (China, Russia, India, Brazil and more) could also be a combined double-whammy for many of the top Dow stocks in 2017 as they are exporters and rely heavily on international opportunities. 24/7 Wall St. has featured nine of the 30 Dow stocks that should be the basis for propelling the Dow toward that 21,422 target in 2017. Not all of them are the highest weightings in the index, because the Dow uses a stock price-weighted methodology rather than a market cap weighted methodology used by more virtually all modern indexes. What needs to be considered is that these nine Dow components are representative of broader groups that should see their valuations bleed over into peers and rivals if they match the expected performance. These are the nine Dow stocks that will be needed to drive the Dow higher in 2016. Apple Shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) generated a return of 12.5% in 2016, with the stock ending the year at $115.82 a share. Apple’s consensus analyst target price of $131.96 at the end of 2016 would imply simple upside of 13.9%, but its 2.0% yield would make for an implied total return of 15.9%, if the analysts get 2017 more accurate than they predicted for 2016. Apple shares have a 52-week trading range of $89.47 to $118.69, and the market cap is $622 billion. The dividend yield is 1.9%. Apple’s upside most likely will depend on the next iteration of the iPhone. That will come later in the year, and we would note that Apple’s upside expectation is far more muted in 2017 than it was for 2016.

Energy was today’s best performing sector even though the EIA inventory report was hugely bearish. Countering the big inventory builds were comments from Russia and Oman that they have already met their agreed January production cuts. The healthcare sector was the day’s worst performer.

The DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage gain ahead of the close Wednesday was Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) which traded up about 2.65% at $61.51. The stock’s 52-week range is $47.97 to $65.46. Volume was nearly 3 times the daily average of around 10 million shares.

The averages quickly fell after Trump's press conference in which he called for more price competition for drug companies. While the market managed to shrug off the comments by the close with technology stocks leading the way, it was a cause for concern for Cramer. "I bet Health and Human Services is going to do something about this whipping boy that will involve substantive rollbacks before this episode is over," the "Mad Money" host said. Cramer reminded investors that just because Trump is pro-business, that doesn't necessarily mean he is pro-stock market. In his world, he thinks if business does well than everyone does better. And he is OK with knowing that some industries will do worse if he believes they should be punished. Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images Drilling floorman steadies a section of drill pipe and cleans the connection during natural-gas drilling operations. "If you are picking individual stocks beyond just the S&P 500 index funds that I always stress for your retirement, you want to avoid mall-based retailers or drug stocks." -Jim Cramer Thus, Trump is not going to bless Merck if it comes up with a better anti-lung cancer drug, Cramer said, and he doesn't care about trying to figure out the costs and benefits of orphan drug status. This won't be a case where being under the Trump microscope is a buying opportunity like it was for Boeing or United Technologies, Cramer warned. "If you own healthcare stocks, understand that our incoming President has got a real blunderbuss approach," Cramer said. Retailers also won't be able to rebound if Trump imposes a tax on imports, either. At the same time, Cramer recommended buying the stocks of companies directly from deregulation. Trump's cabinet appointments sent Cramer the message that they won't push for strict enforcement when it comes to bank lending. The same goes for oil and gas, too. Trump's appointments indicated that government to be a stumbling block when it comes to making money from fossil fuels or pipelines. "If you are picking individual stocks beyond just the S&P 500 index funds that I always stress for your retirement, you want to avoid mall-based retailers or drug stocks," Cramer said. Instead, go for the oil plays, especially if former Exxon-Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson is confirmed as Secretary of State. It may be the most pro-petroleum administration imaginable, Cramer said. So, with oil, gas and banks as the sweet spot of the market, Cramer recommended buying the stocks if they get slammed on upcoming earnings. They could be just like United Technologies and Boeing, which both rallied as soon as they made peace with Trump. Questions for Cramer?

Rising crude oil prices gave energy companies a boost, including oil rig operator Transocean, which rose 4 percent. Traders also bid up shares in utilities. Health care stocks fell after President-elect Donald Trump spoke about the need for the government to stem drug costs by creating new bidding procedures. Pharmaceutical company Endo International led the decliners in the Standard & Poor's 500 index, sliding 8.5 percent. The stock market spent much of the day wavering between small gains and losses as investors sized up outlooks from several companies ahead of the latest batch of corporate earnings reports. "The heavy load comes in the coming weeks," said Tim Dreiling, regional investment director for U.S. Bank's Private Client Reserve. "There's a little bit of a wait-and-see on what those earnings numbers look like." The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.75 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,954.28. The S&P 500 index added 6.42 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,275.32. The Nasdaq gained 11.83 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,563.65. The index has risen every day this year. During a press conference Wednesday morning, Trump said the government has to create new bidding procedures for the pharmaceutical industry "because they're getting away with murder." The remarks sent health care stocks broadly lower, particularly pharmaceutical companies. At one point, drugmakers and one prescription drug distributor accounted for the nine biggest losers in the S&P 500. Endo International posted the biggest loss, tumbling $1.30 to $14.01. Perrigo slid $5.77, or 6.9 percent, to $77.88. Mallinckrodt slumped $3.31, or 6.2 percent, to $50.44. Not all drugmakers had a bad day. Merck rose 2.9 percent on news that the Food and Drug Administration will do a quick review of one of the company's drugs for its potential to treat a type of lung cancer. The stock added $1.71 to $61.63. Big U.S. companies start reporting fourth-quarter earnings this week. On Friday JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America release their results. "As we look into 2017, we still expect equities are going to be able to grind higher, because we still have enough of an economic push to do that," Dreiling said. "But a move up in equities is going to have to come from earnings, otherwise, these valuations ... look pretty stretched, pretty rich at these levels." Investors had their eye Wednesday on companies that released earnings or forecasts of their upcoming quarterly results. SuperValu slid 7.5 percent after the grocery store operator announced a weak third-quarter profit, partly because of falling food prices. The stock shed 36 cents to $4.43. Traders bid up shares in several companies that projected strong fourth-quarter results. Intuitive Surgical gained $15.96, or 2.4 percent, to $678.16, while medical device maker Stryker added $1.76, or 1.4 percent, to $123.66. Quarterly outlooks from other companies failed to impress investors. Signet Jewelers cut its profit forecast for the fourth quarter and current fiscal year, noting its sales fell 5 percent over the holidays. The stock fell $2.76, or 3.2 percent, to $84.70. Auto parts supplier BorgWarner slid 1.6 percent after it issued a profit and sales forecast that fell short of what Wall Street was anticipating. The stock shed 65 cents to $40.12. The major indexes in Europe were mixed. Germany's DAX rose 0.5 percent, while France's CAC 40 was essentially flat. Britain's FTSE 100 gained 0.2 percent. Earlier in Asia, a strong earnings forecast from Samsung Electronics helped drive gains on the South Korean stock market, where the Kospi added 1.5 percent and hit its highest close in over a year. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 0.3 percent. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.2 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.8 percent. Benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.43, or 2.8 percent, to close at $52.25 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, gained $1.46, or 2.7 percent, at $55.10 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline added 5 cents to $1.59 a gallon and heating oil rose 4 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas futures slipped 5 cents to $3.22 per 1,000 cubic feet. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.36 percent from 2.38 percent late Tuesday. In currency markets, the dollar fell to 115.43 yen from 115.73 yen late Tuesday. The euro rose to $1.0576 from $1.0560. The pound, which has been declining amid concern that Britain might break off completely from the European Union's single market, gained ground on the dollar.

Yes No View Results  Loading ... Follow @LethHerald on twitter By Alex Veiga, The Associated Press on January 11, 2017. FILE - This July 16, 2013, file photo, shows a Wall Street street sign outside the New York Stock Exchange. The major U.S. stock indexes edged higher in early trading Wednesday, Jan. 11, 2017, as investors looked ahead to the start of corporate earnings reports later in the week. Energy stocks led the gainers as crude oil prices headed higher, while phone and real estate stocks lagged the most. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Energy companies led U.S. stocks modestly higher Wednesday, nudging the Nasdaq composite to its fifth record-high close in a row. Rising crude oil prices gave energy companies a boost, including oil rig operator Transocean, which rose 4 per cent. Traders also bid up shares in utilities. Health care stocks fell after President-elect Donald Trump spoke about the need for the government to stem drug costs by creating new bidding procedures. Pharmaceutical company Endo International led the decliners in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index, sliding 8.5 per cent. The stock market spent much of the day wavering between small gains and losses as investors sized up outlooks from several companies ahead of the latest batch of corporate earnings reports. “The heavy load comes in the coming weeks,” said Tim Dreiling, regional investment director for U.S. Bank’s Private Client Reserve. “There’s a little bit of a wait-and-see on what those earnings numbers look like.” The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.75 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 19,954.28. The S&P 500 index added 6.42 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 2,275.32. The Nasdaq gained 11.83 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 5,563.65. The index has risen every day this year. During a press conference Wednesday morning, Trump said the government has to create new bidding procedures for the pharmaceutical industry “because they’re getting away with murder.” The remarks sent health care stocks broadly lower, particularly pharmaceutical companies. At one point, drugmakers and one prescription drug distributor accounted for the nine biggest losers in the S&P 500. Endo International posted the biggest loss, tumbling $1.30 to $14.01. Perrigo slid $5.77, or 6.9 per cent, to $77.88. Mallinckrodt slumped $3.31, or 6.2 per cent, to $50.44. Not all drugmakers had a bad day. Merck rose 2.9 per cent on news that the Food and Drug Administration will do a quick review of one of the company’s drugs for its potential to treat a type of lung cancer. The stock added $1.71 to $61.63. Big U.S. companies start reporting fourth-quarter earnings this week. On Friday JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America release their results. “As we look into 2017, we still expect equities are going to be able to grind higher, because we still have enough of an economic push to do that,” Dreiling said. “But a move up in equities is going to have to come from earnings, otherwise, these valuations … look pretty stretched, pretty rich at these levels.” Investors had their eye Wednesday on companies that released earnings or forecasts of their upcoming quarterly results. SuperValu slid 7.5 per cent after the grocery store operator announced a weak third-quarter profit, partly because of falling food prices. The stock shed 36 cents to $4.43. Traders bid up shares in several companies that projected strong fourth-quarter results. Intuitive Surgical gained $15.96, or 2.4 per cent, to $678.16, while medical device maker Stryker added $1.76, or 1.4 per cent, to $123.66. Quarterly outlooks from other companies failed to impress investors. Signet Jewelers cut its profit forecast for the fourth quarter and current fiscal year, noting its sales fell 5 per cent over the holidays. The stock fell $2.76, or 3.2 per cent, to $84.70. Auto parts supplier BorgWarner slid 1.6 per cent after it issued a profit and sales forecast that fell short of what Wall Street was anticipating. The stock shed 65 cents to $40.12. The major indexes in Europe were mixed. Germany’s DAX rose 0.5 per cent, while France’s CAC 40 was essentially flat. Britain’s FTSE 100 gained 0.2 per cent. Earlier in Asia, a strong earnings forecast from Samsung Electronics helped drive gains on the South Korean stock market, where the Kospi added 1.5 per cent and hit its highest close in over a year. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 0.3 per cent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 added 0.2 per cent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 0.8 per cent. Benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.43, or 2.8 per cent, to close at $52.25 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, gained $1.46, or 2.7 per cent, at $55.10 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline added 5 cents to $1.59 a gallon and heating oil rose 4 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas futures slipped 5 cents to $3.22 per 1,000 cubic feet. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.36 per cent from 2.38 per cent late Tuesday. In currency markets, the dollar fell to 115.43 yen from 115.73 yen late Tuesday. The euro rose to $1.0576 from $1.0560. The pound, which has been declining amid concern that Britain might break off completely from the European Union’s single market, gained ground on the dollar. The British currency strengthened to $1.2208 from $1.2163. Among metals, the price of gold rose $11.10 to $1,196.60 an ounce. Silver slipped 2 cents to $16.83 an ounce.

Britain intercepted, deciphered and shared the "Zimmermann Telegram."More >    By EILEEN NG Associated Press KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) - Asian shares were mixed Thursday following President-elect Donald Trump's press conference. Trump offered scant details on policies, disappointing investors hoping for a clearer sense of his plans for trade and economic stimulus. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 shed 0.9 percent to 19,192.76. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dipped 0.1 percent to 22,916.85, and the Shanghai Composite was also down 0.1 percent at 3,133.80. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.2 percent to 5,784.40 and South Korea's Kospi gained 0.3 percent at 2,080.39. Shares in Southeast Asia were mostly higher. WALL STREET: The Nasdaq hit a fifth record-high close in a row, gaining 11.83 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,563.65. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.75 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,954.28. The S&P 500 index added 6.42 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,275.32. TRUMP NEWS: Trump's first news conference in nearly six months was an anti-climax, with scant details on his plans for infrastructure spending and tax reforms. Trump attacked U.S. intelligence services and big pharmaceutical companies, instead of outlining his platform. His comment that the government should change bidding procedures for the pharmaceutical industry "because they're getting away with murder," drove health care stocks lower THE QUOTE: "It is what he didn't mention - fiscal stimulus - that worries market participants. The U.S. dollar rally was based on the assumption that Trump's administration will push through a massive infrastructure building and fiscal stimulus package, which will lead to higher inflation in the future," said Margaret Yang Yan, market analyst with CMC Markets in Singapore. "The slump in the U.S. dollar index last night indicated that assumption is now unwinding because the president-elect never even mentioned that key word 'stimulus'." ENERGY: Benchmark crude oil dipped 8 cents to $52.17 a barrel. It rose $1.43, or 2.8 percent, to close at $52.25 a barrel in New York on Wednesday. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, fell 2 cents to $55.08. CURRENCIES: The dollar fell to 114.74 yen from 115.43 on Wednesday. The euro rose to $1.0603 from $1.0576.

(GuruFocus) Related BA Blood, Sweat And Tear Gas: Trump's 'Cadillac One' To Debut Next Week Attention Boeing Investors: Don't Worry About Trump's Trade War With China The Boeing 737 MAX 10: A Basic Answer To Airbus (Seeking Alpha) The words of President-elect Donald Trump have a Midas-ian touch. Throughout Trump's speech Wednesday morning, comments aimed at particular industries and corporations corresponded with spikes in relevant stocks. Pharmaceuticals, biotech firms, cybersecurity companies, the indices of entire foreign markets — hardly anything emerged from the address untouched. The S&P 500 Index spoke to the impact as it fell 0.5 percent over the first 15 minutes of the speech before rising another 0.5 percent over the next half hour. Pharmaceuticals After Trump said U.S. pharmaceuticals are “getting away with murder” and asserted that “we need new bidding procedures,” ETFs iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology Index (ETF) (NASDAQ: IBB) and SPDR S&P Biotech (ETF) (NYSE: XBI) immediately plunged 2.6 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively. Direxion Daily S&P Biotech Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: LABU) fell 9.8 percent, and Direxion Daily S&P Biotech Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: LABD) rose 9.7 percent. Individual shares also took significant hits, including Mylan Inc (NASDAQ: MYL), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Biogen Inc (NASDAQ: BIIB). Healthcare/Insurance The president-elect also addressed his negative perception of the Affordable Care Act and reiterated his mission to dispose of it. “It'll be repeal and replace,” he said. “It will be essentially simultaneously.” The S&P 500 Health Care responded with a 1.7-percent plunge and has remained down since. One of the biggest corporate losers among health-related companies was NewLink Genetics Corp (NASDAQ: NLNK), the shares of which fell 4.2 percent during the speech and continued to plummet for a total drop of 5.26 percent on the day at last check before publication. Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) also took a 2.4 percent hit and continued to fall, while Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) fell 1.5 percent before rebounding. Cybersecurity When Trump alluded to a hacking-related defense plan set to be created in the next three months, cybersecurity shares immediately peaked. However, the effect was seemingly short-lived. PureFunds ISE Cyber Security ETF (NYSE: HACK) values had dropped 0.8 percent prior to the presidential nod, and, after a brief rally at the time of the comment, remained relatively volatile. Shares are still up on the day. Symantec Corporation (NASDAQ: SYMC) saw similar volatility after a quick, mid-speech drop of 0.5 percent, but its value has generally improved throughout the day. Some in the industry haven’t yet recovered. FireEye Inc (NASDAQ: FEYE) shares fell 2.7 percent and — after a 1.1-percent rally following Trump’s comments — have continued to fall since. Defense The PowerShares Aerospace & Defense (ETF) (NYSE: PPA) moved slightly lower when Trump took the podium (0.1 percent), but trading volume was light at 4,389. Individual corporations felt more significant impact. The shares of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT) and Boeing Co (NYSE: BA) fell 1.5 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively, but each company has seen moderate improvements throughout the day. What Trump Said About International Trade Consistent with his economic platform championing domestic production, Trump praised corporations that have brought manufacturing processes to the United States. “Big news is going to be announced over the next couple of weeks about companies that are going to be building in the Midwest,” he said, praising Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE: FCAU) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) for constructing factories in the United States. The auto manufacturers’ decision to produce domestically diverted investments from Mexico, the economy of which felt the heat of Trump’s address. The Mexican peso's value against the U.S. dollar had fallen throughout the morning; it saw a steep rise in relative value — from 21.99 to 21.79 pesos to the dollar — as soon as Trump began his speech. From then on, the peso fell to 21.95, bounced up to 21.77, and has been on the decline since. iShares MSCI Mexico Inv. Mt. Idx. (ETF) (NYSE: EWW) spiked up 1.9 percent before abruptly falling by a comparable degree. It now stands down 0.36 percent on the day. Mexico’s wasn’t the only economy that reacted to Trump’s speech. Market Vector Russia ETF Trust (NYSE: RSX) values rose and fell within a five-cent range throughout the address but have steadily risen since. "Russia will have far greater respect for our country when I'm leading it,” Trump said. “We're either going to get along, or we're not. I hope we get along, but if we don't, that's possible too.” Trump also called out China for having “taken total advantage of us economically...and (taken) advantage of us in the South China Sea.” The iShares FTSE/Xinhua China 25 Index (ETF) (NYSE: FXI) reacted to the speech with great volatility with values ranging plus or minus $0.10. iShares MSCI Japan ETF (NYSEARCA:EWJ) also swelled 0.5 percent in the middle of the speech and has remained up on the day.

When the president-elect vowed again during a long-awaited press conference to change the way the federal government pays for prescription drugs in the Medicare program, the declaration immediately sent drug company stock prices tumbling. Trump said the government has to create new bidding procedures for the pharmaceutical drug industry "because they're getting away with murder." Merck, Johnson & Johnson, Bristol Myers Squibb and other pharmaceutical companies all saw an immediate reaction to the incoming president's comments. The remarks sent other health care stocks lower as well. The S&P 500 healthcare index .SPXHC, was down about 1 percent. Medicare spends nearly $4 billion on drugs for New Jersey seniors. Under a 2003 law that went into effect during the Bush administration, drug companies are not required to give the government certain discounts that had been commonplace for Medicaid. Instead, each of the private insurance companies that participate in the Medicare marketplace negotiates prices with the drug companies. The are estimates the federal government could save as much as $16 billion annually by negotiating prices directly. That's far below the $300 billion figure touted by Trump when he was a candidate. In New Jersey, nearly every drug on the top 20 list was a brand-name drug, as opposed to the generic substitutes that doctors can prescribe after pharmaceutical patents expire. The drugs ranged from acid reflux and cholesterol medication to psychiatric treatments and controlled substances. In a wide-ranging press conference, Trump said it was his goal to replace Obamacare simultaneously with repealing it. He said he expected that to happen shortly after his nominee for the cabinet post of Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tom Price, is confirmed later this month. The health care platform on which he campaigned did address the issue of drug prices, but made no explicit vow to change the law so Medicare could negotiate prices directly. Instead, he mentioned loosening laws that stand in the way of American patients buying medicines from other countries. His position paper also notes that while drug companies are private, they also provide a public service that has to be considered. It also said in the same section, "Congress will need the courage to step away from the special interests and do what is right for America."

(Nasdaq:AFMD), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing highly targeted cancer immunotherapies, today provided an update on its NK-cell engager platform. “In 2016, we have significantly expanded our activities to optimize the elimination of malignant cells through NK-cell engagement, namely advancing our Phase 1b clinical trial of AFM13 in combination with Merck’s Keytruda and broadening our approach to include the combination of our NK-cell engagers with adoptive transfer of activated NK-cells developed at MD Anderson,” said Adi Hoess, Ph.D., CEO of Affimed.“We further progressed our preclinical NK-cell engager pipeline with our EGFR-targeting solid tumor candidate AFM24 and BCMA-targeting multiple myeloma candidate AFM26,” added Martin Treder, Ph.D., CSO of Affimed. “Due to their high affinity and specificity to CD16A, our molecules offer a novel mechanism of action for NK-cell and macrophage engagement and avoid competition by high IgG serum levels, which currently limits the efficacy of monoclonal antibody-based treatments. In addition, we have gathered important insights into NK-cell biology in various preclinical studies which will allow us to explore further treatment options, for example combining our NK-cell engagers with cytokines such as IL-15 or IL-2.” Leadership position in activating innate and adaptive immunity through engaging NK-cells and macrophages Focusing its efforts on antibodies specifically binding NK-cells through CD16A, a dominant activating receptor on innate immune cells, Affimed has built a clinical and preclinical pipeline of NK-cell-engaging bispecific antibodies (TandAbs®) designed to activate both innate and adaptive immunity. Compared to a variety of T-cell-engaging technologies, Affimed’s NK-cell engagers appear to have a better safety profile and have the potential to achieve more potent and deeper immune responses through enhancing crosstalk of innate to adaptive immunity. Building on its leadership in the NK-cell space, Affimed is also developing tetravalent, bispecific alternative antibody formats (AAFs) for NK-cell engagement offering varying PK/PD profiles relevant to certain diseases. Product candidate AFM13: The most advanced NK-cell engager in clinical development The Company’s lead product candidate, AFM13 targeting CD16A on NK-cells and CD30 on tumor cells, is the most advanced NK-cell engager in the clinic. Its development is focused on combination therapy and supported by The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS).AFM13 is differentiated from monoclonal antibodies as it displays a 1000-fold higher binding affinity to CD16A, shows very limited competition for NK-cell binding with circulating IgG, as well as higher potency compared to full-length CD30 antibodies. Safety and clinical/pharmacodynamic activity in heavily pretreated Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients was established in a Phase 1 study and based on its favorable safety profile and preclinical data, AFM13 is currently under investigation as a combination therapy. NK-cell engagers in combination therapy Combination therapies have demonstrated improved outcomes for cancer patients and are widely pursued to maximize efficacy of immunotherapeutic approaches. Further broadening the therapeutic opportunities for its NK-cell engagers, Affimed is investigating AFM13 in several combination therapies.It is becoming increasingly clear that modulation of immune effectors or the immunosuppressive environment result in higher overall response rates and extended durability of response. In vivo studies in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model have shown that combining AFM13 with checkpoint inhibitors leads to synergistic efficacy of AFM13 when combined with anti-PD-1, likely attributable to the combination of both agents inducing crosstalk between innate and adaptive immunity. Consequently, AFM13 is being investigated with Merck’s anti-PD1 antibody Keytruda in a Phase 1b clinical trial.Currently in early clinical development in a number of hematological malignancies, the adoptive transfer of activated NK-cells provides a strong combination rationale with Affimed’s NK-cell platform to better exploit the therapeutic power of NK-cells. For this, the Company has entered into an exclusive strategic clinical development and commercialization collaboration with MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), in which Affimed intends to investigate AFM13 preclinically and clinically in combination with MDACC’s proprietary NK-cell product in HL. Beyond HL, this approach has potential applications in further medically underserved indications such as multiple myeloma or acute myeloid leukemia.Cytokines such as IL-2 or IL-15 boost NK-cell activity and are tested clinically in a variety of cancers. In recent preclinical studies, Affimed demonstrated that AFM13 induced the upregulation of specific interleukin receptors on NK-cells and the subsequent addition of IL-2 or IL-15 had a synergistic effect on AFM13-mediated NK-cell expansion. Hence, the combination of NK-cell engagers with such cytokines may be clinically useful to deepen responses.

The major U.S. stock indexes edged higher in early trading Wednesday, Jan. 11, 2017, as investors looked ahead to the start of corporate earnings reports later in the week. Energy stocks led the gainers as crude oil prices headed higher, while phone and real estate stocks lagged the most. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Asian shares were mixed Thursday following President-elect Donald Trump's press conference. Trump offered scant details on policies, disappointing investors hoping for a clearer sense of his plans for trade and economic stimulus. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 shed 0.9 percent to 19,192.76. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dipped 0.1 percent to 22,916.85, and the Shanghai Composite was also down 0.1 percent at 3,133.80. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.2 percent to 5,784.40 and South Korea's Kospi gained 0.3 percent at 2,080.39. Shares in Southeast Asia were mostly higher. WALL STREET: The Nasdaq hit a fifth record-high close in a row, gaining 11.83 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,563.65. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.75 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,954.28. The S&P 500 index added 6.42 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,275.32. TRUMP NEWS: Trump's first news conference in nearly six months was an anti-climax, with scant details on his plans for infrastructure spending and tax reforms. Trump attacked U.S. intelligence services and big pharmaceutical companies, instead of outlining his platform. His comment that the government should change bidding procedures for the pharmaceutical industry "because they're getting away with murder," drove health care stocks lower THE QUOTE: "It is what he didn't mention - fiscal stimulus — that worries market participants. The U.S. dollar rally was based on the assumption that Trump's administration will push through a massive infrastructure building and fiscal stimulus package, which will lead to higher inflation in the future," said Margaret Yang Yan, market analyst with CMC Markets in Singapore. "The slump in the U.S. dollar index last night indicated that assumption is now unwinding because the president-elect never even mentioned that key word 'stimulus'." ENERGY: Benchmark crude oil dipped 8 cents to $52.17 a barrel. It rose $1.43, or 2.8 percent, to close at $52.25 a barrel in New York on Wednesday. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, fell 2 cents to $55.08. CURRENCIES: The dollar fell to 114.74 yen from 115.43 on Wednesday. The euro rose to $1.0603 from $1.0576.

Investors will closely watch Trump's speech, looking for clues on where his priorities as the new president lie, after taking office on Jan. 20 and how he plans boost economic growth. Trump's election in November sparked a record-setting rally. But, investors now want evidence on if and how he keeps his campaign-trail promises of stimulating the economy though increased public spending, tax cuts and repatriating U.S. companies' funds from overseas. The dollar, which has also basked in Trump's victory, rose to 102.79. However, concerns over some of his protectionist statements have kept investors wary. "I worry that it is going to be more about the distractions that he will address as opposed to the pro-growth policies and that is going to be the important factor for investors," said Mark Heppenstall, chief investment officer of Penn Mutual Asset Management. Oil prices also helped keep the equity market afloat, rising for the first time in three days after Saudi Arabia provided details of a February supply cut to some of its Asian customers. Investors are also looking out to the corporate earnings season, which kicks off with big banks on Friday, to judge if financial results can support the lofty valuations Wall Street is trading at. S&P 500 companies' earnings are estimated to have risen 5.8 percent in the fourth quarter, the best in three years, largely helped by financials stocks, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. At 11:05 a.m. ET (1605 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 92.26 points, or 0.46 percent, at 19,947.79, the S&P 500 was up 3.65 points, or 0.16 percent, at 2,272.55 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 6.09 points, or 0.11 percent, at 5,557.90. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the healthcare sector's 0.23 percent rise the biggest boost. The sector is set for its seventh straight day of gains. Merck surged 5 percent to $62.91 after the FDA agreed to a speedy review of the company's application to combine immunotherapy with other drugs to treat lung cancer. The stock gave the biggest push to the S&P and the Dow. AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers, which are also developing similar therapies, dropped 1.3 percent and 2.7percent, respectively. Rite Aid rose 3.8 percent to $8.64 after the NY Post reported that the drugstore operator's deal to be acquired by Walgreens would be approved this month. Walgreens rose 2.6 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,565 to 1,212. On the Nasdaq, 1,324 issues fell and 1,285 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed 12 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 59 new highs and eight new lows.

Trump offered scant details on policies, disappointing investors hoping for a clearer sense of his plans for trade and economic stimulus. KEEPING SCORE: Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 shed 0.9 percent to 19,192.76. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dipped 0.1 percent to 22,916.85, and the Shanghai Composite was also down 0.1 percent at 3,133.80. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 added 0.2 percent to 5,784.40 and South Korea’s Kospi gained 0.3 percent at 2,080.39. Shares in Southeast Asia were mostly higher. WALL STREET: The Nasdaq hit a fifth record-high close in a row, gaining 11.83 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,563.65. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.75 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,954.28. The S&P 500 index added 6.42 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,275.32. Federal News Radio conducted an exclusive data center survey to assess how agencies are storing data. Download the results. TRUMP NEWS: Trump’s first news conference in nearly six months was an anti-climax, with scant details on his plans for infrastructure spending and tax reforms. Trump attacked U.S. intelligence services and big pharmaceutical companies, instead of outlining his platform. His comment that the government should change bidding procedures for the pharmaceutical industry “because they’re getting away with murder,” drove health care stocks lower Advertisement THE QUOTE: “It is what he didn’t mention – fiscal stimulus — that worries market participants. The U.S. dollar rally was based on the assumption that Trump’s administration will push through a massive infrastructure building and fiscal stimulus package, which will lead to higher inflation in the future,” said Margaret Yang Yan, market analyst with CMC Markets in Singapore. “The slump in the U.S. dollar index last night indicated that assumption is now unwinding because the president-elect never even mentioned that key word ‘stimulus’.” ENERGY: Benchmark crude oil dipped 8 cents to $52.17 a barrel. It rose $1.43, or 2.8 percent, to close at $52.25 a barrel in New York on Wednesday. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, fell 2 cents to $55.08. CURRENCIES: The dollar fell to 114.74 yen from 115.43 on Wednesday. The euro rose to $1.0603 from $1.0576.

Energy stocks led the gainers as crude oil prices closed higher. Health care stocks were down the most after President-elect Donald Trump said the government needs to overhaul how it buys drugs from pharmaceutical companies. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average was up 68 points, or 0.3 percent, to 19,923 as of 1:22 p.m. Mountain time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index added 3 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,272. The Nasdaq composite index gained 5 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,557. The Nasdaq has closed at a record high the past four days in a row. VIDEOS TOP JOBS THE QUOTE: The stock indexes have been drifting between small gains and losses for much of the day, likely because investors are looking ahead to the next wave of corporate earnings reports, which kick off Friday, noted Tim Dreiling, regional investment director for U.S. Bank's Private Client Reserve. "The heavy load comes in the coming weeks," Dreiling said. "There's a little bit of a wait-and-see on what those earnings numbers look like." TRUMP FACTOR: During a press conference Wednesday morning, Trump said the government has to create new bidding procedures for the pharmaceutical industry "because they're getting away with murder." The remarks sent health care stocks broadly lower. Several pharmaceutical companies slumped, with Endo International falling 7.6 percent, the biggest decliner in the S&P 500. The stock slid $1.16 to $14.15. Perrigo lost $6.33, or 7.6 percent, to $77.33. Mallinckrodt tumbled $3.24, or 6 percent, to $50.51. UNAPPETIZING RESULTS: SuperValu slid 7.1 percent after the grocery store operator announced a weak third-quarter profit, partly because of falling food prices. The stock shed 34 cents to $4.45. SALES SLUMP: Signet Jewelers fell 3.5 percent after the company cut its profit forecast for the fourth quarter and current fiscal year. Signet said its total sales fell 5 percent over the holidays, citing technical problems at its e-commerce business. The stock fell $3.09 to $84.37. DISAPPOINTING FORECAST: Auto parts supplier BorgWarner was down 1.7 percent after it issued a profit and sales forecast that fell short of what Wall Street was anticipating. The stock shed 69 cents to $40.08. FASTER IS BETTER: Drugmaker Merck rose 2.3 percent on news that the Food and Drug Administration will do a quick review of one of the company's drugs for its potential to treat a type of lung cancer. The stock added $1.41 at $61.33. HEALTHY OUTLOOK: Intuitive Surgical gained 2.4 percent after the robotic surgical systems maker delivered a strong fourth-quarter sales forecast. The stock rose $15.86 to $678.06. EARNINGS SEASON: Big U.S. companies start reporting fourth-quarter earnings this week. On Friday JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America release their results. Still, investors had their eye on a few companies that released quarterly results Wednesday. MARKETS OVERSEAS: Germany's DAX rose 0.5 percent, while France's CAC 40 was essentially flat. Britain's FTSE 100 gained 0.2 percent. In Asia, a strong earnings forecast from Samsung Electronics helped drive gains on the South Korean stock market, where the Kospi added 1.5 percent and hit its highest close in over a year. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 0.3 percent. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.2 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.8 percent. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.43, or 2.8 percent, to close at $52.25 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, gained $1.46, or 2.7 percent, at $55.10 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline added 5 cents to $1.59 a gallon and heating oil rose 4 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas futures slipped 5 cents to $3.22 per 1,000 cubic feet. BONDS: Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.37 percent from 2.38 percent late Tuesday. CURRENCIES: The pound continued to weaken amid concern that Britain might break off completely from the European Union's single market. The currency was trading at $1.2201, up from $1.2163 the day before. The dollar fell to 115.49 yen from 115.73 yen late Tuesday. The euro rose to $1.0575 from $1.0560. METALS: The price of gold rose $11.10 to $1,196.60 an ounce. Silver slipped 2 cents to $16.83 an ounce. Copper was little changed at $2.61 a pound.   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Kirby: Wait'll you see how much the Mormon church pays me How much do top Mormon leaders make?

Trump offered scant details on policies, disappointing investors hoping for a clearer sense of his plans for trade and economic stimulus. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 shed 0.9 percent to 19,192.76. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dipped 0.1 percent to 22,916.85, and the Shanghai Composite was also down 0.1 percent at 3,133.80. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.2 percent to 5,784.40 and South Korea's Kospi gained 0.3 percent at 2,080.39. Shares in Southeast Asia were mostly higher. WALL STREET: The Nasdaq hit a fifth record-high close in a row, gaining 11.83 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,563.65. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.75 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,954.28. The S&P 500 index added 6.42 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,275.32. TRUMP NEWS: Trump's first news conference in nearly six months was an anti-climax, with scant details on his plans for infrastructure spending and tax reforms. Trump attacked U.S. intelligence services and big pharmaceutical companies, instead of outlining his platform. His comment that the government should change bidding procedures for the pharmaceutical industry "because they're getting away with murder," drove health care stocks lower THE QUOTE: "It is what he didn't mention - fiscal stimulus - that worries market participants. The U.S. dollar rally was based on the assumption that Trump's administration will push through a massive infrastructure building and fiscal stimulus package, which will lead to higher inflation in the future," said Margaret Yang Yan, market analyst with CMC Markets in Singapore. "The slump in the U.S. dollar index last night indicated that assumption is now unwinding because the president-elect never even mentioned that key word 'stimulus'." ENERGY: Benchmark crude oil dipped 8 cents to $52.17 a barrel. It rose $1.43, or 2.8 percent, to close at $52.25 a barrel in New York on Wednesday.

BUSINESS Stocks close up; drug firms dive after Trump says they're 'getting away with murder' New York Stock Exchange Mark Lennihan / Associated Press The New York Stock Exchange building in Lower Manhattan. The New York Stock Exchange building in Lower Manhattan. (Mark Lennihan / Associated Press) Associated Press Energy companies led U.S. stocks modestly higher Wednesday, nudging the Nasdaq composite index to its fifth record-high close in a row. Rising crude oil prices gave energy companies a boost, including oil rig operator Transocean, which rose 4%. Traders also bid up shares in utilities. Healthcare stocks fell after President-elect Donald Trump spoke about the need for the government to stem drug costs by creating new bidding procedures. The stock market spent much of the day wavering between small gains and losses as investors sized up outlooks from several companies ahead of the latest batch of corporate earnings reports. “The heavy load comes in the coming weeks,” said Tim Dreiling, regional investment director for U.S. Bank's Private Client Reserve. “There's a little bit of a wait-and-see on what those earnings numbers look like.” The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.75 points, or 0.5%, to 19,954.28. The Standard & Poor's 500 index advanced 6.42 points, or 0.3%, to 2,275.32. The Nasdaq gained 11.83 points, or 0.2%, to 5,563.65. The index has risen every day this year. During a news conference Wednesday morning, Trump said the government has to create new bidding procedures for the pharmaceutical industry “because they're getting away with murder.” The remarks sent healthcare stocks broadly lower, particularly pharmaceutical companies’ shares. At one point, drugmakers and one prescription drug distributor accounted for the nine biggest losers in the S&P 500. Pharmaceutical company Endo International led the decliners in the S&P 500 index, sliding 8.5% to $14.01. Perrigo slid 6.9% to $77.88. Mallinckrodt slumped 6.2% to $50.44. Not all drugmakers had a bad day. Merck rose 2.9% to $61.63 on news that the Food and Drug Administration will do a quick review of one of the company's drugs for its potential to treat a type of lung cancer. Big U.S. companies start reporting fourth-quarter earnings this week. On Friday, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America are to release their results. “As we look into 2017, we still expect equities are going to be able to grind higher, because we still have enough of an economic push to do that,” Dreiling said. “But a move up in equities is going to have to come from earnings. Otherwise, these valuations look pretty stretched, pretty rich at these levels.” Investors had their eye Wednesday on companies that released earnings or forecasts of their upcoming quarterly results. SuperValu slid 7.5% to $4.43 after the grocery store operator announced a weak third-quarter profit, partly because of falling food prices. Read more: Why cheaper food in 2016 was not necessarily good news » Traders bid up shares in several companies that projected strong fourth-quarter results. Intuitive Surgical climbed 2.4% to $678.16, and medical device maker Stryker advanced 1.4% to $123.66. Quarterly outlooks from other companies failed to impress investors. Signet Jewelers cut its profit forecast for the fourth quarter and current fiscal year, noting its sales fell 5% over the holidays. The stock fell 3.2% to $84.70. Auto parts supplier BorgWarner slid 1.6% to $40.12 after it issued a profit and sales forecast that fell short of what Wall Street was anticipating. Oil prices rose: Benchmark U.S. crude climbed $1.43, or 2.8%, to $52.25 a barrel. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, rose $1.46, or 2.7%, to $55.10 a barrel. Wholesale gasoline rose 5 cents to $1.59 a gallon, and heating oil rose 4 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas futures fell 5 cents to $3.22 per 1,000 cubic feet. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.36% from Tuesday's 2.38%. The dollar fell to 115.43 yen from 115.73 yen. The euro rose to $1.0576 from $1.0560. The pound, which has been declining amid concern that Britain might break completely from the European Union's single market, gained ground on the dollar, rising to $1.2208 from $1.2163. Gold rose $11.10 to $1,196.60 an ounce. Silver fell 2 cents to $16.83 an ounce. Copper was little changed at $2.61 a pound. Germany's DAX rose 0.5%, while France's CAC 40 was essentially flat. Britain's FTSE 100 gained 0.2%. A strong earnings forecast from Samsung Electronics helped drive gains on the South Korean stock market, where the Kospi rose 1.5% to its highest close in more than a year. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 0.3%. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.2%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.8%.  Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss What values does Hollywood promote? A storm that hit Northern California toppled the Pioneer Cabin Tree. Who should discipline police officers? Michelle King has made no big waves in her first year running Los Angeles Unified. A state watchdog agency is investigating political donations connected to real estate developer Samuel Leung.

Meet the Contributors → At Allergan And Other Pharmas, Price Transparency Has Limits Alex Lash January 11th, 2017 @alexlash @xconomy Like Us Xconomy National —  The first test of pharmaceutical giant Allergan’s promise to behave responsibly came last week. The firm acknowledged price hikes on several drugs that stayed—sometimes barely—under the 10 percent limit that CEO Brent Saunders pledged last September, in what he called a “social contract with patients.” In an interview at the annual J.P. Morgan healthcare investment conference in San Francisco, Saunders reiterated that the high single-digit price hikes would only bring Allergan (NYSE: AGN) a two or three percent net increase in revenues after middlemen like Express Scripts (NYSE: ESRX) and CVS Health (NYSE: CVS), called pharmacy benefit managers, negotiate discounts and rebates. Saunders also said that price transparency—explaining the factors that determine a drug’s cost—was an important part of regaining trust for an industry whose public reputation has scraped bottom for years. He chided other drug makers, particularly Biogen (NASDAQ: BIIB), which announced in December a $750,000 first-year price tag for nusinersen (Spinraza), a treatment for the rare disease spinal muscular atrophy. “Don’t just put the price out there without context,” he said. Nusinersen might provide value greater than the price tag, but without the justification, he said, “it looks ridiculous. We’re missing a common-sense gene in this industry.” (When asked to explain nusinersen’s price last month, Biogen spokesman Matt Fearer told Xconomy that the company balanced “a number of important factors, including its clinical value, its impact to patients and the health care system as a whole, and the need for Biogen to fund further research and development to make the next innovation possible.”) Saunders said Allergan would explain in detail the rationale behind list prices of newly launched drugs as they arrive. But transparency has its limits for Saunders and other pharma groups who were in town for the annual gathering. Saunders said Allergan would not reveal real-world prices, which drug companies negotiate in secret with insurers and their purchasing agents. One common estimate is that actual prices are, on average, 30 percent below list prices for private insurance plans. When presented with estimated figures, drug companies refuse to disclose actual prices, as Bloomberg reported last summer. Revealing the discounts that stem from negotiations with middlemen “would put us at a tremendous competitive disadvantage,” Saunders said. “We’d sign on only if everyone did it.” After Xconomy spoke with Saunders, Johnson & Johnson said it would soon publish the average increase in list prices for its products, as well as the average price after rebates—but, like Allergan, not the true costs of individual drugs. Speaking on a conference panel Tuesday, Merck executive vice president Julie Gerberding, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that the pricing system for drugs and other healthcare products was “capricious and obfuscated.” But she sided with Allergan and Merck, saying that revealing real-world prices for individual drugs would only benefit companies if there was “transparency across the board.” Saunders made headlines last year when he wrote that Allergan, one of the drug industry’s most aggressive acquirers, would only raise prices once a year and only make single-digit increases. His company is best known for the cosmetic drug botulinum (Botox) that also has several therapeutic uses. It also has substantial businesses in eye treatments, gastrointestinal disease, mood disorders, and women’s health. Headquartered in Ireland for tax purposes, the company is mainly based in the U.S. It turned a $15 billion profit in 2015 and $10.7 billion profit in the first three quarters of 2016. A few other companies were also “more or less exercising self-restraint” with similar increases, he said this week, citing new price data released last week by several analysts. Saunders was asked if the new pledge will require Allergan to expand its pipeline more aggressively and spread those smaller, once-a-year increases among more products to keep the income flowing. “With few exceptions, the social contract has nothing to do with how we think about R&D,” Saunders said. “If we do our job right and source innovation for true unmet medical need, and we price the value of those medicines appropriately at launch, the social contract shouldn’t be an issue.” Allergan has grown through a series of massive deals, although the biggest of all—its $160 billion merger with Pfizer (NYSE: PFE)—died before consummation last year. Saunders was widely considered to be the CEO-in-waiting of the combined company. Before the merger was scuttled, Allergan began more pointedly touting its innovative side, not through a big internal research effort, but by partnering with smaller biotechs. This year and last year it has gathered biotech venture capitalists at J.P. Morgan to remind them of its potential acquisition interests. Allergan last year made a big push into non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, an advanced form of liver disease, last year with the purchase of clinical-stage Tobira Therapeutics and preclinical Akarna Therapeutics. New drugs from Allergan and competitors, if approved, could command premium pricing because of the growing number of advanced cases—often requiring liver transplant—driven by obesity and diabetes. Two more deals Allergan announced Monday also showed a willingness to make selective investments in early-stage work. In one deal, Allergan took an option to buy Lysosomal Therapeutics, a developer following relatively new biological clues to develop a drug for Parkinson’s disease. At ths year’s breakfast, attendees had as many questions about Allergan’s pricing stance and the outlook under a Trump administration and Republican-led Congress. “To have a Republican-controlled government for the next four years, or perhaps just two, is a net positive for the industry,” said Saunders, citing favorable tax changes and … Next Page » Single PageCurrently on Page: 1 2 Alex Lash is Xconomy's National Biotech Editor.

Trump faces the press: President-elect Donald Trump is set to hold his first press conference since July. Investors are hoping Trump will provide more detail on his plans for trade, taxes, jobs and Obamacare. He canceled a previously scheduled press conference in December where he was expected to outline how he'd deal with conflicts of interest arising from his sprawling business dealings. Trump is also likely to face questions about allegations that Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about him. His comments at the conference -- much like his tweets -- will be closely dissected and have the potential to move markets around the world. 2. Rex Tillerson's confirmation: The U.S. Senate will hold a hearing today on the nomination of former ExxonMobil (XOM) CEO Rex Tillerson to be the next secretary of state. The confirmation hearing around 9:15 a.m. ET is likely to focus on the oilman's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Tillerson is likely to be quizzed on climate change and energy policy as well. There's also a confirmation hearing scheduled on Wednesday for Elaine Chao, Trump's pick to lead the Transportation Department. Before the Bell newsletter: Key market news. In your inbox.

Fresh all-time highs for the Nasdaq came as the Dow industrials failed to reach the psychologically significant level of 20,000 again, amid otherwise tepid enthusiasm for equities ahead of a news conference from President-elect Donald Trump set for Wednesday—his first since being elected on Nov. 8. But the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.48%  shined, finishing up 20.00 points, or 0.4%, at 5,551.82, for the sixth straight day in the green and marked its longest streak of all-time highs since Dec. 27, 1999, according to Dow Jones data. Meanwhile, The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.18%  ended at its flattest level in years, unchanged from Monday at 2,268.90. The broad-market gauge had been up by as many as 10 points earlier in the session. Five of the 11 main sectors closed lower, bookended by a 1.3% decline in the real-estate sector and a 0.4% gain in consumer-discretionary stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.03% which had traded up by as many as 70 points and within 43 of breaching the 20,000 mark earlier in the session, closed down 31.85 points, or 0.2%, at 19,855.53. Shares of Merck & Co. MRK, +0.21%  and Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, +0.01%  dragged on the benchmark. Beyond, Trump’s comments, which could add clarity to his legislative agenda, market participants are awaiting the kick off earnings season for some support for the recent rally in U.S. stocks. The market is looking for confirmation of stock valuations at current levels, and the only way to get that will be upbeat earnings, said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. Some of evidence of pre-Trump news conference jitters were on display in the dollar DXY, +0.02% which pulled back somewhat on Wednesday. The greenback was up about 0.1% against major currencies. The dollar has been rising on hopes that the new administration’s fiscal stimulus will boost the economy, but some analysts believe that bet may have been pushed too far, too fast. “In the near term, there are a lot of things to worry about. For example, we might hear some chatter from the corporations about the sharp rise in the dollar, which will have an impact on their earnings in the next few quarters,” said Maris Ogg, president at Tower Bridge Advisors. Ogg, however, isn't worried about stock markets over the next few years, in part because of expected deregulation.

Therefore, the upside risks prevail in the U.S. markets,” said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, in a note to investors. Read: Here’s why Trump’s inauguration could mark a near-term top for stocks “Basically Friday, we have two bank stocks coming up, and if they beat expectations both top and bottom line, I think we could see the Dow finally hit that 20,000 mark,” said Cardillo. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +0.53% and Bank of America Corp. BAC, +0.39% among banks due to report Friday, closed up 0.3% and 1.7%, respectively. Economic docket: No major economic reports were released Tuesday. The National Federation of Independent Business said its optimism index jumped 7.4 points to 105.8, the strongest reading since 2004. November job openings rose as did the number of people quitting jobs while wholesale inventories for November jumped 1%. Stocks to watch: Shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. VRX, -1.92%  shot up 6.8% after announcing a couple of deals.

Pharma Two charts capture the dark mood around Big Pharma in 2017 By Arundhati Parmar Post a comment / Jan 10, 2017 at 12:59 PM Shares66 Big Pharma is toast this year. Or at least that’s what these two charts from a small sample of attendee responses at a breakfast reception Tuesday during the ongoing J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference reveal. While the survey captured real-time responses of 30-plus people, it is a snapshot of the sentiment surrounding large pharmaceutical companies and their prospects in the next 12 months. Here’s what Mark Lubkeman, senior partner and managing director of BCG, the consulting firm hosting the reception asked a panel of medtech and pharma executives and the gathered audience: Which healthcare sector do you expect to show the best value creation in 2017? And here’s how the audience responded: Notice the 0% growth in pharma for this year. “Classic pharma companies are in trouble,” Lubkeman said to audience laughter as results of the real-time survey showed up. The next question was: Which healthcare sector do you expect to show the worst value in 2017? Here’s the chart that shows most people in the room were down on healthcare providers followed by large pharma companies. The panel chimed in with one large pharmaceutical company executive displaying wry humor. “I would like to thank everybody for their confidence in Merck & Co. – duly noted,” said Sunil Patel, vice president and head of corporate development at Merck, and the audience once again guffawed. Then, on a more serious note, Patel proceeded to describe the challenges ahead for this sector in 2017 and beyond. “I do think all the Big Pharmas will probably going to be challenged. Next year (read 2017) we might have a little bit of growth, but over the next two to three years”… he trailed off. Patent cliffs are looming, he pointed out. For Merck they involve Vytorin and Zetia, both cholesterol drugs. “The biosimilars are going to start rolling in and so you are going to see Big Pharma challenged for growth,” Patel said. He did, however, point out that even despite the challenges there are pockets of opportunity. “If you are in the I/O (immuno-oncology), you have a unique opportunity to see some growth,” Patel noted, adding that these assets involve a lot of “R&D burn.” And so how do you get the growth given that traditional revenue streams are drying up and high-quality drugs like I/O products eat up a lot of cash. “So then the corollary becomes, ‘what do you do to fix it’ and that’s when you pay too much for a biotech company,” Patel declared confirming the notion that biotechs are going to see good growth this year. And deal flow has already begun with Takeda announcing Monday that it is buying Ariad Pharma for $4.7 billion, or $24 per share. And Johnson & Johnson is attempting to buy Swiss biotech firm Actelion after initial discussions failed. Photo: Herianus, Getty Images Shares66 Topics #JPM17, Big Pharma, J.P.

Adimab Provides Annual Update on 2016 Partnerships and Milestones - 16 New Partner Agreements Signed - - Over 40 Milestones Achieved - - Multiple Partner Programs Advance in Clinical Trials - January 10, 2017 10:00 AM Eastern Standard Time LEBANON, N.H.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Adimab, LLC, the global leader in the discovery and optimization of fully human monoclonal and bispecific antibodies, today announced that it has entered into definitive agreements with nine new companies in 2016. In addition, Adimab announced the expansion of seven of its current partnerships and the achievement of over 40 technical and development milestones across multiple existing collaborations. Over the past eight years, Adimab has entered into over 40 partnerships for the discovery of therapeutic IgGs and bispecific antibodies, generating in excess of 150 therapeutic programs using the Adimab platform. The most advanced program is currently in Phase 2 clinical trials. New alliances for 2016 include collaborations with Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Iconic Therapeutics, Tizona Therapeutics, Scholar Rock, and iTeos Therapeutics, among others. In addition, Adimab expanded its partnerships with Innovent Biosciences and Jounce Therapeutics, and several others. “We are focused on being a premier technology company, not a product company,” commented Guy Van Meter, Vice President of Business Development at Adimab. “Our success is entirely dependent upon the success of our partners and, therefore, every program is very important to us. Speed is a critical aspect for many of our partners, but identifying a therapeutic lead that provides a competitive advantage is even more important.” “At Adimab, we are committed to continually improving and expanding our technical offering to provide the best antibody discovery platform in the industry,” added Tillman Gerngross, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Adimab. “We want our partners to have solutions for all of their therapeutic approaches so that Adimab is the partner of choice in turning their biological insights into transformative drugs.” Adimab also announced that it achieved over 40 technical and development milestones in 2016 with Merck, Kyowa Hakko Kirin, Kite Pharma, Surface Oncology, GSK, and several others. Adimab partners exercised a total of 13 commercial licenses in 2016, in addition to Mersana and Innovent filing INDs and Arsanis advancing its lead program into Phase 2 clinical trials. “Adimab was able to rapidly identify and screen a large number of antibodies that interact with HER2 in unique ways; this allowed us to select a lead antibody with superior ADC properties. XMT1522, our lead program, is comprised of this antibody conjugated to our highly differentiated Dolaflexin ADC platform, and has shown superior efficacy and tolerability in a broad range of pre-clinical models,” said Anna Protopapas, Chief Executive Officer of Mersana Therapeutics. ”Phase 1 trials for XMT1522 are ongoing.” “We have pursued numerous programs with Adimab and have experienced excellent success. Our anti-PD1 program has initiated clinical trials in 2016, a mere two years after completing our campaign with Adimab,” added Michael Wu, Chief Executive Officer at Innovent. “The speed of the Adimab technology has helped Innovent rapidly develop multiple products.” Adimab has established antibody discovery collaborations with many leading pharmaceutical companies, such as Merck, Novo Nordisk, Biogen, GSK, Roche, Novartis, Eli Lilly, Genentech, Celgene, Gilead, Kyowa Hakko Kirin, Takeda and Sanofi. In addition, Adimab has partnered with several smaller publicly traded companies, such as Acceleron, Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, Kite, Five Prime, as well as leading venture-backed companies including Jounce, Mersana, Alector, Arsanis, Surface Oncology, Potenza, Tizona, Tusk and several academic institutions such as Memorial Sloan Kettering and MD Anderson. The Adimab antibody discovery and optimization platform has also been internalized by several larger pharma partners; Adi-inside partners include Merck, Novo Nordisk, Biogen and GSK. About Adimab Adimab’s integrated antibody discovery and optimization platform provides unprecedented speed from antigen to purified, full-length human IgGs. Adimab offers fundamental advantages by delivering diverse panels of therapeutically relevant antibodies that meet the most aggressive standards for affinity, epitope coverage, species cross-reactivity and developability. Adimab enables its partners to rapidly expand their biologics pipelines through a broad spectrum of technology access arrangements. For more information, visit http://www.adimab.com.

The expansion, which includes the opening of two new process development centers in the U.S. and China, follows the commercial success of Merck's biodevelopment center in Martillac, France. The two new units will be located in close proximity to customers in the Shanghai and Boston metropolitan areas. Each will provide a full range of process development capabilities and services. This includes cell line development services, both upstream and downstream process development, as well as non-GMP clinical production. "We are seeing an increasing global demand for end-to-end process development solutions and Merck offers a one-stop shop for biopharma customers," said Udit Batra, Member of the Merck Executive Board and CEO, Life Science. "This expansion reinforces our position as the premier supplier of all process development and clinical stage manufacturing solutions, materials and services needed for the production of biologics. This is a strategic, high-potential investment for Merck specifically designed to meet customer needs on three continents." Merck's biodevelopment center in Martillac, France, is a fully operational single-use, GMP facility for manufacturing clinical stage batches. Equipped with a full suite of Merck technologies, including the 2000 liter single-use Mobius ® bioreactor, Martillac offers biopharma companies a complete solution to support their clinical development programs. Merck's end-to-end offering delivers important benefits and addresses key challenges for biopharmaceutical companies at all stages of molecule development and commercialization in any geography. In addition to the Mobius ® bioreactor, the end-to-end portfolio includes solutions such as Lynx ® CDR, Viresolve ® Process Area Modules, Pellicon ® and Centinel™ Intelligence Virus Defense. Early-stage companies with limited resources and infrastructure benefit from a partner with strong expertise and experience developing processes and GMP clinical manufacturing to help accelerate early clinical development programs. Companies in more advanced stages need to overcome the challenges of moving from late phase clinical development into commercial manufacturing, accelerating availability of affordable life-enhancing drugs.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) FILE - This July 16, 2013, file photo, shows a Wall Street street sign outside the New York Stock Exchange. The major U.S. stock indexes edged higher in early trading Wednesday, Jan. 11, 2017, as investors looked ahead to the start of corporate earnings reports later in the week. Energy stocks led the gainers as crude oil prices headed higher, while phone and real estate stocks lagged the most. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) Energy companies led U.S. stocks modestly higher Wednesday, nudging the Nasdaq composite to its fifth record-high close in a row. Rising crude oil prices gave energy companies a boost, including oil rig operator Transocean, which rose 4 percent. Traders also bid up shares in utilities. Health care stocks fell after President-elect Donald Trump spoke about the need for the government to stem drug costs by creating new bidding procedures. Pharmaceutical company Endo International led the decliners in the Standard & Poor's 500 index, sliding 8.5 percent. The stock market spent much of the day wavering between small gains and losses as investors sized up outlooks from several companies ahead of the latest batch of corporate earnings reports. VIDEOS TOP JOBS "The heavy load comes in the coming weeks," said Tim Dreiling, regional investment director for U.S. Bank's Private Client Reserve. "There's a little bit of a wait-and-see on what those earnings numbers look like." The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.75 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,954.28. The S&P 500 index added 6.42 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,275.32. The Nasdaq gained 11.83 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,563.65. The index has risen every day this year. During a press conference Wednesday morning, Trump said the government has to create new bidding procedures for the pharmaceutical industry "because they're getting away with murder." The remarks sent health care stocks broadly lower, particularly pharmaceutical companies. At one point, drugmakers and one prescription drug distributor accounted for the nine biggest losers in the S&P 500. Endo International posted the biggest loss, tumbling $1.30 to $14.01. Perrigo slid $5.77, or 6.9 percent, to $77.88. Mallinckrodt slumped $3.31, or 6.2 percent, to $50.44. Not all drugmakers had a bad day. Merck rose 2.9 percent on news that the Food and Drug Administration will do a quick review of one of the company's drugs for its potential to treat a type of lung cancer. The stock added $1.71 to $61.63. Big U.S. companies start reporting fourth-quarter earnings this week. On Friday JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America release their results. "As we look into 2017, we still expect equities are going to be able to grind higher, because we still have enough of an economic push to do that," Dreiling said. "But a move up in equities is going to have to come from earnings, otherwise, these valuations ... look pretty stretched, pretty rich at these levels." Investors had their eye Wednesday on companies that released earnings or forecasts of their upcoming quarterly results. SuperValu slid 7.5 percent after the grocery store operator announced a weak third-quarter profit, partly because of falling food prices. The stock shed 36 cents to $4.43. Traders bid up shares in several companies that projected strong fourth-quarter results. Intuitive Surgical gained $15.96, or 2.4 percent, to $678.16, while medical device maker Stryker added $1.76, or 1.4 percent, to $123.66. Quarterly outlooks from other companies failed to impress investors. Signet Jewelers cut its profit forecast for the fourth quarter and current fiscal year, noting its sales fell 5 percent over the holidays. The stock fell $2.76, or 3.2 percent, to $84.70. » Next page...

Posted 11 Jan 2017 20:30 Updated 12 Jan 2017 05:45 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) shortly after the opening bell in New York, U.S., January 9, 2017. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson - RTX2Y5P9 Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: U.S. stocks ended higher after a choppy day on Wednesday as energy and technology gains countered a drop in healthcare stocks after President-elect Donald Trump said pharmaceutical companies were "getting away with murder" by charging high prices. The Nasdaq ended the day with another record closing high after falling as much as 0.5 percent after Trump's first formal news conference since the Nov. 8 election. The S&P 500 healthcare index ended the session down 1 percent after falling as much as 1.9 percent earlier in the day and the Nasdaq biotechnology index sank 2.96 percent, ending a six-day winning streak for both indexes. "When somebody that high profile says something that negative, people do not want to invest in it. They view the sector as uninvestible, and withdraw their money," Brad Loncar, manager of the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF . However, the sector's pain eased as the session wore on as money managers noted that Trump gave no new specific details on his healthcare proposals, according to Michael Scanlon, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management in Boston. He cited the beginning of fourth-quarter earnings season on Friday and Trump's inauguration as President on Jan. 20 as reasons for investor caution. "Portfolio managers have every reason in the world to sit on their hands," said Scanlon. "You put those two factors together and I don't think you're going to see much movement in the market until maybe we get some fireworks on Friday with earnings." The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 98.75 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,954.28, the S&P 500 gained 6.42 points, or 0.28 percent, to 2,275.32 and the Nasdaq Composite added 11.83 points, or 0.21 percent, to 5,563.65.Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors ended the day higher. Energy stocks , ended 1.2 percent higher as crude oil prices rose. The S&P's technology index ended up 0.7 percent, boosted most by Microsoft Corp , Facebook Inc and Apple Inc . The biggest drag on the S&P's healthcare sector was Bristol-Meyers Squibb's with a 5.3 percent decline, after news that Merck & Co. leapfrogged its rivals in the race to combine immunotherapy with other drugs as a treatment for lung cancer. The next-biggest weights on the sector included Johnson & Johnson , with a 1.2 percent drop and Abbvie with a 3.6 percent decline. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.20-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.22-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 20 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 99 new highs and 18 new lows. About 7.2 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Wednesday compared with the 6.57 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

Posted 12 Jan 2017 05:38 Updated 12 Jan 2017 05:50 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. (Photo: AP/Richard Drew) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: US stocks finished higher on Wednesday (Jan 11) following a volatile session, with strong gains by energy shares offsetting the hit to the pharmaceutical sector following criticism by President-elect Donald Trump. Pharma shares quickly nosedived after Trump accused the industry of "getting away with murder" in offshoring production capacity and overcharging for drugs. He said he would push to change the bidding procedures for drugs. Pfizer fell 1.9 per cent, Celgene 2.3 per cent and Mylan 4.3 per cent, while Bristol-Myers fell 5.3 per cent. But those losses were countered by solid gains by petroleum-linked stocks after oil prices advanced. Apple and some other technology shares also pushed higher. The market is "bullish and hopeful that the new administration and Congress can deliver these new plans right away," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 98.75 points (0.50 per cent) to end at 19,954.28. The broad-based S&P 500 advanced 6.42 points (0.28 per cent) to 2,275.32, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index gained 11.83 points (0.21 per cent) to 5,563.65, another record. Merck bucked the tide among pharma companies, jumping 2.9 per cent on news the Food and Drug Administration accepted for review the drug giant's treatment for metastatic lung cancer. United Continental advanced 2.0 per cent after it released December performance estimates that bested expectations due to improved booking. American Airlines rose 0.3 per cent after it said improved results in December had boosted its fourth-quarter estimate for revenue per passenger mile travelled. Ford shed 1.4 per cent after it confirmed that it expects about US$10.2 billion in pre-tax 2016 profits. It said it expects "continued strong performance in 2017." - AFP/ec Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Connect Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2017 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

The major U.S. stock indexes edged higher in early trading Wednesday, Jan. 11, 2017, as investors looked ahead to the start of corporate earnings reports later in the week. Energy stocks led the gainers as crude oil prices headed higher, while phone and real estate stocks lagged the most. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Asian shares were mixed Thursday following President-elect Donald Trump's press conference. Trump offered scant details on policies, disappointing investors hoping for a clearer sense of his plans for trade and economic stimulus. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 shed 0.9 percent to 19,192.76. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dipped 0.1 percent to 22,916.85, and the Shanghai Composite was also down 0.1 percent at 3,133.80. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.2 percent to 5,784.40 and South Korea's Kospi gained 0.3 percent at 2,080.39. Shares in Southeast Asia were mostly higher. WALL STREET: The Nasdaq hit a fifth record-high close in a row, gaining 11.83 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,563.65. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.75 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,954.28. The S&P 500 index added 6.42 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,275.32. TRUMP NEWS: Trump's first news conference in nearly six months was an anti-climax, with scant details on his plans for infrastructure spending and tax reforms. Trump attacked U.S. intelligence services and big pharmaceutical companies, instead of outlining his platform. His comment that the government should change bidding procedures for the pharmaceutical industry "because they're getting away with murder," drove health care stocks lower THE QUOTE: "It is what he didn't mention - fiscal stimulus — that worries market participants. The U.S. dollar rally was based on the assumption that Trump's administration will push through a massive infrastructure building and fiscal stimulus package, which will lead to higher inflation in the future," said Margaret Yang Yan, market analyst with CMC Markets in Singapore. "The slump in the U.S. dollar index last night indicated that assumption is now unwinding because the president-elect never even mentioned that key word 'stimulus'." ENERGY: Benchmark crude oil dipped 8 cents to $52.17 a barrel. It rose $1.43, or 2.8 percent, to close at $52.25 a barrel in New York on Wednesday. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, fell 2 cents to $55.08. CURRENCIES: The dollar fell to 114.74 yen from 115.43 on Wednesday. The euro rose to $1.0603 from $1.0576.

FILE - This July 16, 2013, file photo, shows a Wall Street street sign outside the New York Stock Exchange. The major U.S. stock indexes edged higher in early trading Wednesday, Jan. 11, 2017, as investors looked ahead to the start of corporate earnings reports later in the week. Energy stocks led the gainers as crude oil prices headed higher, while phone and real estate stocks lagged the most. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) The major U.S. stock indexes veered slightly higher in late-afternoon trading after spending much of the day wavering between small gains and losses. Energy stocks led the gainers as crude oil prices closed higher. Health care stocks were down the most after President-elect Donald Trump said the government needs to overhaul how it buys drugs from pharmaceutical companies. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average was up 68 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 19,923 as of 3:22 p.m. Eastern Time. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index added 3 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 2,272. The Nasdaq composite index gained 5 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 5,557. The Nasdaq has closed at a record high the past four days in a row. THE QUOTE: The stock indexes have been drifting between small gains and losses for much of the day, likely because investors are looking ahead to the next wave of corporate earnings reports, which kick off Friday, noted Tim Dreiling, regional investment director for U.S. Bank’s Private Client Reserve. “The heavy load comes in the coming weeks,” Dreiling said. “There’s a little bit of a wait-and-see on what those earnings numbers look like.” TRUMP FACTOR: During a press conference Wednesday morning, Trump said the government has to create new bidding procedures for the pharmaceutical industry “because they’re getting away with murder.” The remarks sent health care stocks broadly lower. Several pharmaceutical companies slumped, with Endo International falling 7.6 per cent, the biggest decliner in the S&P 500. The stock slid $1.16 to $14.15. Perrigo lost $6.33, or 7.6 per cent, to $77.33. Mallinckrodt tumbled $3.24, or 6 per cent, to $50.51. UNAPPETIZING RESULTS: SuperValu slid 7.1 per cent after the grocery store operator announced a weak third-quarter profit, partly because of falling food prices. The stock shed 34 cents to $4.45. SALES SLUMP: Signet Jewelers fell 3.5 per cent after the company cut its profit forecast for the fourth quarter and current fiscal year. Signet said its total sales fell 5 per cent over the holidays, citing technical problems at its e-commerce business. The stock fell $3.09 to $84.37. DISAPPOINTING FORECAST: Auto parts supplier BorgWarner was down 1.7 per cent after it issued a profit and sales forecast that fell short of what Wall Street was anticipating. The stock shed 69 cents to $40.08. FASTER IS BETTER: Drugmaker Merck rose 2.3 per cent on news that the Food and Drug Administration will do a quick review of one of the company’s drugs for its potential to treat a type of lung cancer. The stock added $1.41 at $61.33. HEALTHY OUTLOOK: Intuitive Surgical gained 2.4 per cent after the robotic surgical systems maker delivered a strong fourth-quarter sales forecast. The stock rose $15.86 to $678.06. EARNINGS SEASON: Big U.S. companies start reporting fourth-quarter earnings this week. On Friday JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America release their results. Still, investors had their eye on a few companies that released quarterly results Wednesday. MARKETS OVERSEAS: Germany’s DAX rose 0.5 per cent, while France’s CAC 40 was essentially flat. Britain’s FTSE 100 gained 0.2 per cent. In Asia, a strong earnings forecast from Samsung Electronics helped drive gains on the South Korean stock market, where the Kospi added 1.5 per cent and hit its highest close in over a year. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 0.3 per cent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 added 0.2 per cent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 0.8 per cent. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.43, or 2.8 per cent, to close at $52.25 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, gained $1.46, or 2.7 per cent, at $55.10 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline added 5 cents to $1.59 a gallon and heating oil rose 4 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas futures slipped 5 cents to $3.22 per 1,000 cubic feet. BONDS: Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.37 per cent from 2.38 per cent late Tuesday. CURRENCIES: The pound continued to weaken amid concern that Britain might break off completely from the European Union’s single market. The currency was trading at $1.2201, up from $1.2163 the day before. The dollar fell to 115.49 yen from 115.73 yen late Tuesday. The euro rose to $1.0575 from $1.0560.

Britain intercepted, deciphered and shared the "Zimmermann Telegram."More >    By EILEEN NG Associated Press KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) - Asian shares were mixed Thursday following President-elect Donald Trump's press conference. Trump offered scant details on policies, disappointing investors hoping for a clearer sense of his plans for trade and economic stimulus. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 shed 0.9 percent to 19,192.76. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dipped 0.1 percent to 22,916.85, and the Shanghai Composite was also down 0.1 percent at 3,133.80. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.2 percent to 5,784.40 and South Korea's Kospi gained 0.3 percent at 2,080.39. Shares in Southeast Asia were mostly higher. WALL STREET: The Nasdaq hit a fifth record-high close in a row, gaining 11.83 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,563.65. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.75 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,954.28. The S&P 500 index added 6.42 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,275.32. TRUMP NEWS: Trump's first news conference in nearly six months was an anti-climax, with scant details on his plans for infrastructure spending and tax reforms. Trump attacked U.S. intelligence services and big pharmaceutical companies, instead of outlining his platform. His comment that the government should change bidding procedures for the pharmaceutical industry "because they're getting away with murder," drove health care stocks lower THE QUOTE: "It is what he didn't mention - fiscal stimulus - that worries market participants. The U.S. dollar rally was based on the assumption that Trump's administration will push through a massive infrastructure building and fiscal stimulus package, which will lead to higher inflation in the future," said Margaret Yang Yan, market analyst with CMC Markets in Singapore. "The slump in the U.S. dollar index last night indicated that assumption is now unwinding because the president-elect never even mentioned that key word 'stimulus'." ENERGY: Benchmark crude oil dipped 8 cents to $52.17 a barrel. It rose $1.43, or 2.8 percent, to close at $52.25 a barrel in New York on Wednesday. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, fell 2 cents to $55.08. CURRENCIES: The dollar fell to 114.74 yen from 115.43 on Wednesday. The euro rose to $1.0603 from $1.0576.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) comments KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — Asian shares were mixed Thursday following President-elect Donald Trump's press conference. Trump offered scant details on policies, disappointing investors hoping for a clearer sense of his plans for trade and economic stimulus. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 shed 0.9 percent to 19,192.76. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dipped 0.1 percent to 22,916.85, and the Shanghai Composite was also down 0.1 percent at 3,133.80.

TRUMP NEWS: Trump's first news conference in nearly six months was an anti-climax, with scant details on his plans for infrastructure spending and tax reforms. Trump attacked U.S. intelligence services and big pharmaceutical companies, instead of outlining his platform. His comment that the government should change bidding procedures for the pharmaceutical industry "because they're getting away with murder," drove health care stocks lower THE QUOTE: "It is what he didn't mention - fiscal stimulus — that worries market participants. The U.S. dollar rally was based on the assumption that Trump's administration will push through a massive infrastructure building and fiscal stimulus package, which will lead to higher inflation in the future," said Margaret Yang Yan, market analyst with CMC Markets in Singapore. "The slump in the U.S. dollar index last night indicated that assumption is now unwinding because the president-elect never even mentioned that key word 'stimulus'."

Trump offered scant details on policies, disappointing investors hoping for a clearer sense of his plans for trade and economic stimulus. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 shed 0.9 percent to 19,192.76. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dipped 0.1 percent to 22,916.85, and the Shanghai Composite was also down 0.1 percent at 3,133.80. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.2 percent to 5,784.40 and South Korea's Kospi gained 0.3 percent at 2,080.39. Shares in Southeast Asia were mostly higher. WALL STREET: The Nasdaq hit a fifth record-high close in a row, gaining 11.83 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,563.65. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.75 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,954.28. The S&P 500 index added 6.42 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,275.32. TRUMP NEWS: Trump's first news conference in nearly six months was an anti-climax, with scant details on his plans for infrastructure spending and tax reforms. Trump attacked U.S. intelligence services and big pharmaceutical companies, instead of outlining his platform. His comment that the government should change bidding procedures for the pharmaceutical industry "because they're getting away with murder," drove health care stocks lower THE QUOTE: "It is what he didn't mention - fiscal stimulus - that worries market participants. The U.S. dollar rally was based on the assumption that Trump's administration will push through a massive infrastructure building and fiscal stimulus package, which will lead to higher inflation in the future," said Margaret Yang Yan, market analyst with CMC Markets in Singapore. "The slump in the U.S. dollar index last night indicated that assumption is now unwinding because the president-elect never even mentioned that key word 'stimulus'." ENERGY: Benchmark crude oil dipped 8 cents to $52.17 a barrel. It rose $1.43, or 2.8 percent, to close at $52.25 a barrel in New York on Wednesday. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, fell 2 cents to $55.08. CURRENCIES: The dollar fell to 114.74 yen from 115.43 on Wednesday. The euro rose to $1.0603 from $1.0576.

FILE - This July 16, 2013, file photo, shows a Wall Street street sign outside the New York Stock Exchange. The major U.S. stock indexes edged higher in early trading Wednesday, Jan. 11, 2017, as investors looked ahead to the start of corporate earnings reports later in the week. Energy stocks led the gainers as crude oil prices headed higher, while phone and real estate stocks lagged the most. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) A steep slide in pharmaceutical companies pulled U.S. stock indexes mostly lower in afternoon trading Wednesday. The health care sector slumped after President-elect Donald Trump said the government needs to overhaul how it buys drugs from pharmaceutical companies. Energy companies rose the most as crude oil prices headed higher. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average was up 23 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 19,877 as of 1:36 p.m. Eastern Time. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index slid 5 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 2,263. The Nasdaq composite index fell 22 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 5,529. The Nasdaq has closed at a record high the past four days in a row. TRUMP FACTOR: During a press conference Wednesday morning, Trump said the government has to create new bidding procedures for the pharmaceutical industry “because they’re getting away with murder.” The remarks sent health care stocks broadly lower. Several pharmaceutical companies slumped, with Endo International falling 9.8 per cent, the biggest decliner in the S&P 500. The stock slid $1.51 to $13.81. Perrigo lost $6, or 7.2 per cent, to $77.65. Mallinckrodt tumbled $4.50, or 8.4 per cent, to $49.25. UNAPPETIZING RESULTS: SuperValu slid 7.6 per cent after the grocery store operator announced a weak third-quarter profit, partly because of falling food prices. The stock shed 37 cents to $4.43. SALES SLUMP: Signet Jewelers slid 4.2 per cent after the company cut its profit forecast for the fourth quarter and current fiscal year. Signet said its total sales fell 5 per cent over the holidays, citing technical problems at its e-commerce business. The stock fell $3.65 to $83.81. DISAPPOINTING FORECAST: Auto parts supplier BorgWarner was down 2.3 per cent after it issued a profit and sales forecast that fell short of what Wall Street was anticipating. The stock shed 93 cents to $39.84. FASTER IS BETTER: Drugmaker Merck rose 1.8 per cent on news that the Food and Drug Administration will do a quick review of one of the company’s drugs for its potential to treat a type of lung cancer. The stock added $1.06 at $60.98. HEALTHY OUTLOOK: Intuitive Surgical gained 1.6 per cent after the robotic surgical systems maker delivered a strong fourth-quarter sales forecast. The stock rose $10.75 to $672.95. EARNINGS SEASON: Big U.S. companies start reporting fourth-quarter earnings this week. On Friday JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America release their results. Still, investors had their eye on a few companies that released quarterly results Wednesday. MARKETS OVERSEAS: Germany’s DAX rose 0.5 per cent, while France’s CAC 40 was essentially flat. Britain’s FTSE 100 gained 0.2 per cent. In Asia, a strong earnings forecast from Samsung Electronics helped drive gains on the South Korean stock market, where the Kospi added 1.5 per cent and hit its highest close in over a year. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 0.3 per cent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 added 0.2 per cent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 0.8 per cent. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude was up $1.93, or 3.8 per cent, at $52.74 a barrel in New York, having lost $1.14 the day before. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, was up $1.99, or 3.7 per cent, at $55.63 a barrel in London. BONDS: Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.34 per cent from 2.38 per cent late Tuesday. CURRENCIES: The pound continued to weaken amid concern that Britain might break off completely from the European Union’s single market. The currency was trading at $1.2226, down from $1.2163 the day before. The dollar fell to 114.74 yen from 115.73 yen late Tuesday. The euro rose to $1.0595 from $1.0560. 000000 000000 Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply. You must be logged in to post a comment.

Energy stocks led the gainers as crude oil prices closed higher. Health care stocks were down the most after President-elect Donald Trump said the government needs to overhaul how it buys drugs from pharmaceutical companies. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average was up 68 points, or 0.3 percent, to 19,923 as of 1:22 p.m. Mountain time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index added 3 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,272. The Nasdaq composite index gained 5 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,557. The Nasdaq has closed at a record high the past four days in a row. VIDEOS TOP JOBS THE QUOTE: The stock indexes have been drifting between small gains and losses for much of the day, likely because investors are looking ahead to the next wave of corporate earnings reports, which kick off Friday, noted Tim Dreiling, regional investment director for U.S. Bank's Private Client Reserve. "The heavy load comes in the coming weeks," Dreiling said. "There's a little bit of a wait-and-see on what those earnings numbers look like." TRUMP FACTOR: During a press conference Wednesday morning, Trump said the government has to create new bidding procedures for the pharmaceutical industry "because they're getting away with murder." The remarks sent health care stocks broadly lower. Several pharmaceutical companies slumped, with Endo International falling 7.6 percent, the biggest decliner in the S&P 500. The stock slid $1.16 to $14.15. Perrigo lost $6.33, or 7.6 percent, to $77.33. Mallinckrodt tumbled $3.24, or 6 percent, to $50.51. UNAPPETIZING RESULTS: SuperValu slid 7.1 percent after the grocery store operator announced a weak third-quarter profit, partly because of falling food prices. The stock shed 34 cents to $4.45. SALES SLUMP: Signet Jewelers fell 3.5 percent after the company cut its profit forecast for the fourth quarter and current fiscal year. Signet said its total sales fell 5 percent over the holidays, citing technical problems at its e-commerce business. The stock fell $3.09 to $84.37. DISAPPOINTING FORECAST: Auto parts supplier BorgWarner was down 1.7 percent after it issued a profit and sales forecast that fell short of what Wall Street was anticipating. The stock shed 69 cents to $40.08. FASTER IS BETTER: Drugmaker Merck rose 2.3 percent on news that the Food and Drug Administration will do a quick review of one of the company's drugs for its potential to treat a type of lung cancer. The stock added $1.41 at $61.33. HEALTHY OUTLOOK: Intuitive Surgical gained 2.4 percent after the robotic surgical systems maker delivered a strong fourth-quarter sales forecast. The stock rose $15.86 to $678.06. EARNINGS SEASON: Big U.S. companies start reporting fourth-quarter earnings this week. On Friday JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America release their results. Still, investors had their eye on a few companies that released quarterly results Wednesday. MARKETS OVERSEAS: Germany's DAX rose 0.5 percent, while France's CAC 40 was essentially flat. Britain's FTSE 100 gained 0.2 percent. In Asia, a strong earnings forecast from Samsung Electronics helped drive gains on the South Korean stock market, where the Kospi added 1.5 percent and hit its highest close in over a year. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 0.3 percent. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.2 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.8 percent. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.43, or 2.8 percent, to close at $52.25 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, gained $1.46, or 2.7 percent, at $55.10 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline added 5 cents to $1.59 a gallon and heating oil rose 4 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas futures slipped 5 cents to $3.22 per 1,000 cubic feet. BONDS: Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.37 percent from 2.38 percent late Tuesday. CURRENCIES: The pound continued to weaken amid concern that Britain might break off completely from the European Union's single market. The currency was trading at $1.2201, up from $1.2163 the day before. The dollar fell to 115.49 yen from 115.73 yen late Tuesday. The euro rose to $1.0575 from $1.0560. METALS: The price of gold rose $11.10 to $1,196.60 an ounce. Silver slipped 2 cents to $16.83 an ounce.

Britain intercepted, deciphered and shared the "Zimmermann Telegram."More >    By EILEEN NG Associated Press KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) - Asian shares were mixed Thursday following President-elect Donald Trump's press conference. Trump offered scant details on policies, disappointing investors hoping for a clearer sense of his plans for trade and economic stimulus. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 shed 0.9 percent to 19,192.76. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dipped 0.1 percent to 22,916.85, and the Shanghai Composite was also down 0.1 percent at 3,133.80. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.2 percent to 5,784.40 and South Korea's Kospi gained 0.3 percent at 2,080.39. Shares in Southeast Asia were mostly higher. WALL STREET: The Nasdaq hit a fifth record-high close in a row, gaining 11.83 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,563.65. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.75 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,954.28. The S&P 500 index added 6.42 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,275.32. TRUMP NEWS: Trump's first news conference in nearly six months was an anti-climax, with scant details on his plans for infrastructure spending and tax reforms. Trump attacked U.S. intelligence services and big pharmaceutical companies, instead of outlining his platform. His comment that the government should change bidding procedures for the pharmaceutical industry "because they're getting away with murder," drove health care stocks lower THE QUOTE: "It is what he didn't mention - fiscal stimulus - that worries market participants. The U.S. dollar rally was based on the assumption that Trump's administration will push through a massive infrastructure building and fiscal stimulus package, which will lead to higher inflation in the future," said Margaret Yang Yan, market analyst with CMC Markets in Singapore. "The slump in the U.S. dollar index last night indicated that assumption is now unwinding because the president-elect never even mentioned that key word 'stimulus'." ENERGY: Benchmark crude oil dipped 8 cents to $52.17 a barrel. It rose $1.43, or 2.8 percent, to close at $52.25 a barrel in New York on Wednesday. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, fell 2 cents to $55.08. CURRENCIES: The dollar fell to 114.74 yen from 115.43 on Wednesday. The euro rose to $1.0603 from $1.0576.

By SueChang Markets reporter RyanVlastelica Markets reporter The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed less than 50 points from the psychologically-important 20,000 mark on Wednesday following President-elect Donald Trump’s first news conference in months. The Nasdaq also extended gains to its fifth straight record close. Major indexes oscillated between small gains and losses during the session while biotech stocks were notable losers after Trump said companies were “getting away with murder” with respect to drug prices. Energy shares were among the day’s biggest gainers, rising alongside a jump in the price of crude oil. Read: MarketWatch’s live blog on Donald Trump’s press conference The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.03% rose 98.75 points, or 0.5%, to close at 19,954.28, while the S&P 500 index ESH7, -0.19%  gained 6.42 points, or 0.3%, to end at 2,275.32. The Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.48% added 11.83 points, or 0.2%, to finish at a record 5,563.65. “The easy part for the Trump administration has been done. Now words have to be transformed into action and policies. The speed of this, more specifically regulatory relief and tax reform, may dictate the immediate direction of the markets,” said Kent Engelke, chief economic strategist at Capitol Securities Management Inc. “If his proposals [and] policies are thought to be bogging down, prices will suffer.” See: How U.S. stocks tend to perform after presidential inaugurations In a measure of how uncertainty wasn't alleviated by the news conference, the CBOE Volatility VIX, -2.69%  at one time rose more than 5%, though it remains well below its long-term average. Typically, the so-called “fear index” has an inverse correlation with stocks. “There’s a lot of indecisiveness in the market. We can’t seem to built on a rally or get any sustained momentum in a correction,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. “Investors are playing both sides, trying to figure out what earnings will look like, and what the Trump administration will look like in terms of actual policy.” Read: Why chasing after high-yield dividend stocks is bad news Markets have advanced since Trump’s election in early November, with key indexes hitting repeated records. That rally has shown signs of stalling of late, with some analysts worried that the gains have gotten overdone. Investors also watched the confirmation hearings of Rex Tillerson, Trump’s nominee to head the State Department. Russia and China were major topics of discussion in the hearings. Here's what Trump means for the tech industry(1:34) Why not all of Trump's proposed policies may have a harmful effect on Silicon Valley. Need to know: The biggest risk as markets shrug at the Trump-Russia imbroglio Joseph Quinlan, head of market and thematic strategy at Bank of America Private Wealth Management, said the coming administration has been more hard-line toward China while sympathetic to Russia. “The shifting U.S. policy stance towards Russia and China presents asymmetric risks to Corporate America,” he said in a report. “Of the two dance partners, U.S. economic/financial linkages with China are far thicker and critical to U.S. firms relative to shallow U.S.-Russian ties. What’s more, the market potential of China is infinitely more attractive than Russia.” Read: Trump’s game of chicken with China is a lose-lose situation Economic docket: Investors will hear from several Fed officials over the next two days, including Chairwoman Janet Yellen, and retail sales data are due Friday.

Business Stocks close up; drug firms dive after Trump says they're 'getting away with murder' New York Stock Exchange Mark Lennihan / Associated Press The New York Stock Exchange building in Lower Manhattan. The New York Stock Exchange building in Lower Manhattan. (Mark Lennihan / Associated Press) Associated Press Energy companies led U.S. stocks modestly higher Wednesday, nudging the Nasdaq composite index to its fifth record-high close in a row. Rising crude oil prices gave energy companies a boost, including oil rig operator Transocean, which rose 4%. Traders also bid up shares in utilities. Healthcare stocks fell after President-elect Donald Trump spoke about the need for the government to stem drug costs by creating new bidding procedures. The stock market spent much of the day wavering between small gains and losses as investors sized up outlooks from several companies ahead of the latest batch of corporate earnings reports. “The heavy load comes in the coming weeks,” said Tim Dreiling, regional investment director for U.S. Bank's Private Client Reserve. “There's a little bit of a wait-and-see on what those earnings numbers look like.” The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.75 points, or 0.5%, to 19,954.28. The Standard & Poor's 500 index advanced 6.42 points, or 0.3%, to 2,275.32. The Nasdaq gained 11.83 points, or 0.2%, to 5,563.65. The index has risen every day this year. During a news conference Wednesday morning, Trump said the government has to create new bidding procedures for the pharmaceutical industry “because they're getting away with murder.” The remarks sent healthcare stocks broadly lower, particularly pharmaceutical companies’ shares. At one point, drugmakers and one prescription drug distributor accounted for the nine biggest losers in the S&P 500. Pharmaceutical company Endo International led the decliners in the S&P 500 index, sliding 8.5% to $14.01. Perrigo slid 6.9% to $77.88. Mallinckrodt slumped 6.2% to $50.44. Not all drugmakers had a bad day. Merck rose 2.9% to $61.63 on news that the Food and Drug Administration will do a quick review of one of the company's drugs for its potential to treat a type of lung cancer. Big U.S. companies start reporting fourth-quarter earnings this week. On Friday, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America are to release their results. “As we look into 2017, we still expect equities are going to be able to grind higher, because we still have enough of an economic push to do that,” Dreiling said. “But a move up in equities is going to have to come from earnings. Otherwise, these valuations look pretty stretched, pretty rich at these levels.” Investors had their eye Wednesday on companies that released earnings or forecasts of their upcoming quarterly results. SuperValu slid 7.5% to $4.43 after the grocery store operator announced a weak third-quarter profit, partly because of falling food prices. Read more: Why cheaper food in 2016 was not necessarily good news » Traders bid up shares in several companies that projected strong fourth-quarter results. Intuitive Surgical climbed 2.4% to $678.16, and medical device maker Stryker advanced 1.4% to $123.66. Quarterly outlooks from other companies failed to impress investors. Signet Jewelers cut its profit forecast for the fourth quarter and current fiscal year, noting its sales fell 5% over the holidays. The stock fell 3.2% to $84.70. Auto parts supplier BorgWarner slid 1.6% to $40.12 after it issued a profit and sales forecast that fell short of what Wall Street was anticipating. Oil prices rose: Benchmark U.S. crude climbed $1.43, or 2.8%, to $52.25 a barrel. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, rose $1.46, or 2.7%, to $55.10 a barrel. Wholesale gasoline rose 5 cents to $1.59 a gallon, and heating oil rose 4 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas futures fell 5 cents to $3.22 per 1,000 cubic feet. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.36% from Tuesday's 2.38%. The dollar fell to 115.43 yen from 115.73 yen. The euro rose to $1.0576 from $1.0560. The pound, which has been declining amid concern that Britain might break completely from the European Union's single market, gained ground on the dollar, rising to $1.2208 from $1.2163. Gold rose $11.10 to $1,196.60 an ounce. Silver fell 2 cents to $16.83 an ounce. Copper was little changed at $2.61 a pound. Germany's DAX rose 0.5%, while France's CAC 40 was essentially flat. Britain's FTSE 100 gained 0.2%. A strong earnings forecast from Samsung Electronics helped drive gains on the South Korean stock market, where the Kospi rose 1.5% to its highest close in more than a year. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 0.3%. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.2%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.8%.  Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss What values does Hollywood promote? A storm that hit Northern California toppled the Pioneer Cabin Tree. Who should discipline police officers? Michelle King has made no big waves in her first year running Los Angeles Unified. A state watchdog agency is investigating political donations connected to real estate developer Samuel Leung.

Energy stocks led the gainers as crude oil prices headed higher, while phone and real estate stocks lagged the most. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Asian shares were mixed Thursday following President-elect Donald Trump's press conference. Trump offered scant details on policies, disappointing investors hoping for a clearer sense of his plans for trade and economic stimulus. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 shed 0.9 percent to 19,192.76. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dipped 0.1 percent to 22,916.85, and the Shanghai Composite was also down 0.1 percent at 3,133.80. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.2 percent to 5,784.40 and South Korea's Kospi gained 0.3 percent at 2,080.39. Shares in Southeast Asia were mostly higher. WALL STREET: The Nasdaq hit a fifth record-high close in a row, gaining 11.83 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,563.65. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.75 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,954.28. The S&P 500 index added 6.42 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,275.32. TRUMP NEWS: Trump's first news conference in nearly six months was an anti-climax, with scant details on his plans for infrastructure spending and tax reforms. Trump attacked U.S. intelligence services and big pharmaceutical companies, instead of outlining his platform. His comment that the government should change bidding procedures for the pharmaceutical industry "because they're getting away with murder," drove health care stocks lower THE QUOTE: "It is what he didn't mention - fiscal stimulus — that worries market participants. The U.S. dollar rally was based on the assumption that Trump's administration will push through a massive infrastructure building and fiscal stimulus package, which will lead to higher inflation in the future," said Margaret Yang Yan, market analyst with CMC Markets in Singapore. "The slump in the U.S. dollar index last night indicated that assumption is now unwinding because the president-elect never even mentioned that key word 'stimulus'." ENERGY: Benchmark crude oil dipped 8 cents to $52.17 a barrel. It rose $1.43, or 2.8 percent, to close at $52.25 a barrel in New York on Wednesday. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, fell 2 cents to $55.08. CURRENCIES: The dollar fell to 114.74 yen from 115.43 on Wednesday. The euro rose to $1.0603 from $1.0576.

Energy stocks led the gainers as crude oil prices headed higher, while phone and real estate stocks lagged the most. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Energy companies led U.S. stocks mostly higher in midday trading Wednesday as crude oil prices headed higher. Health care stocks slumped after President-elect Donald Trump said the government needs to overhaul its bidding process for drugs from pharmaceutical companies. Investors were looking ahead to the start of corporate earnings reports later this week. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average rose 73 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 19,928 as of 12 p.m. Eastern Time. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index gained 2 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 2,271. The Nasdaq composite index fell less than 1 point to 5,551. The Nasdaq has closed at a record high the past four days in a row. TRUMP FACTOR: During a press conference Wednesday morning, Trump said the government has to create new bidding procedures for the pharmaceutical drug industry “because they’re getting away with murder.” The remarks sent health care stocks broadly lower. Several pharmaceutical companies slumped, with Endo International falling 10.3 per cent, the biggest decliner in the S&P 500. The stock slid $1.58 to $13.73. Perrigo lost $7.12, or 8.5 per cent, to $76.53. Mallinckrodt tumbled $4.29, or 8 per cent, to $49.46. UNAPPETIZING RESULTS: SuperValu slid 8.4 per cent after the grocery store operator announced a weak third-quarter profit, partly because of falling food prices. The stock shed 40 cents to $4.39. SALES SLUMP: Signet Jewelers slid 3.7 per cent after the company cut its profit forecast for the fourth quarter and current fiscal year. Signet said its total sales fell 5 per cent over the holidays, citing technical problems at its e-commerce business. The stock fell $3.25 to $84.21. DISAPPOINTING FORECAST: Auto parts supplier BorgWarner was down 2.8 per cent after it issued a profit and sales forecast that fell short of what Wall Street was anticipating. The stock shed $1.13 to $39.64. FASTER IS BETTER: Drugmaker Merck rose 2.2 per cent on news that the Food and Drug Administration will do a quick review of one of the company’s drugs for its potential to treat a type of lung cancer. The stock added $1.31 at $61.23. HEALTHY OUTLOOK: Intuitive Surgical gained 1.6 per cent after the robotic surgical systems maker delivered a strong fourth-quarter sales forecast. The stock rose $10.77 to $672.97. EARNINGS SEASON: Big U.S. companies start reporting fourth-quarter earnings this week. On Friday JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America release their results. Still, investors had their eye on a few companies that released quarterly results Wednesday. MARKETS OVERSEAS: Germany’s DAX was up 0.5 per cent, while France’s CAC 40 was essentially flat. Britain’s FTSE 100 was up 0.2 per cent. In Asia, a strong earnings forecast from Samsung Electronics helped drive gains on the South Korean stock market, where the Kospi added 1.5 per cent and hit its highest close in over a year. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 0.3 per cent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 added 0.2 per cent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 0.8 per cent. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude was up $1.23, or 2.4 per cent, at $52.05 a barrel in New York, having lost $1.14 the day before. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, was up $1.28, or 2.4 per cent, at $54.92 a barrel in London. BONDS: Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.36 per cent from 2.38 per cent late Tuesday. CURRENCIES: The pound continued to weaken amid concern that Britain might break off completely from the European Union’s single market. The currency was trading at $1.2066, down from $1.2163 the day before. The dollar rose to 116.61 yen from 115.73 yen late Tuesday. The euro fell to $1.0476 from $1.0560. 000000 000000 Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply. You must be logged in to post a comment.

Britain intercepted, deciphered and shared the "Zimmermann Telegram."More >    By EILEEN NG Associated Press KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) - Asian shares were mixed Thursday following President-elect Donald Trump's press conference. Trump offered scant details on policies, disappointing investors hoping for a clearer sense of his plans for trade and economic stimulus. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 shed 0.9 percent to 19,192.76. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dipped 0.1 percent to 22,916.85, and the Shanghai Composite was also down 0.1 percent at 3,133.80. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.2 percent to 5,784.40 and South Korea's Kospi gained 0.3 percent at 2,080.39. Shares in Southeast Asia were mostly higher. WALL STREET: The Nasdaq hit a fifth record-high close in a row, gaining 11.83 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,563.65. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.75 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,954.28. The S&P 500 index added 6.42 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,275.32. TRUMP NEWS: Trump's first news conference in nearly six months was an anti-climax, with scant details on his plans for infrastructure spending and tax reforms. Trump attacked U.S. intelligence services and big pharmaceutical companies, instead of outlining his platform. His comment that the government should change bidding procedures for the pharmaceutical industry "because they're getting away with murder," drove health care stocks lower THE QUOTE: "It is what he didn't mention - fiscal stimulus - that worries market participants. The U.S. dollar rally was based on the assumption that Trump's administration will push through a massive infrastructure building and fiscal stimulus package, which will lead to higher inflation in the future," said Margaret Yang Yan, market analyst with CMC Markets in Singapore. "The slump in the U.S. dollar index last night indicated that assumption is now unwinding because the president-elect never even mentioned that key word 'stimulus'." ENERGY: Benchmark crude oil dipped 8 cents to $52.17 a barrel. It rose $1.43, or 2.8 percent, to close at $52.25 a barrel in New York on Wednesday. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, fell 2 cents to $55.08. CURRENCIES: The dollar fell to 114.74 yen from 115.43 on Wednesday. The euro rose to $1.0603 from $1.0576.

Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, is scheduled to speak in New York at 11:00 a.m. ET (1600 GMT). Trump's election in November sparked a record-setting rally. But, investors now want evidence on if and how he keeps his campaign-trail promises of stimulating the economy though increased public spending, tax cuts and repatriating U.S. companies' funds from overseas. The dollar, which has also basked in Trump's victory, was up against the yen. However, concerns of some of his protectionist statements have kept investors wary. Keeping futures afloat were oil prices, which edged up for the first time in three days after Saudi Arabia provided details of a February supply cut to some of its Asian customers. "The overall technical picture for the stock market remains firm and we look for commodities to be the market leaders of the day, thereby, keeping the markets upward trend in place," Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial, said in a note. Dow e-minis were up 2 points, or 0.01 percent at 8:47 a.m. ET, with 21,832 contracts changing hands. S&P 500 e-minis were down 2 points, or 0.09 percent, with 123,587 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 0.75 points, or 0.01 percent, on volume of 19,484 contracts. Investors are also closely watching the corporate earnings season, which kicks off with big banks on Friday, to see if financial results can support the lofty valuations Wall Street is trading at. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is estimated to have risen 5.8 percent in the fourth quarter - the best in three years - largely helped by financials stocks, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The S&P 500 ended flat on Tuesday, while the Nasdaq logged a record close due to gains in healthcare and technology stocks. New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley is expected to speak on banking regulations at 01:20 p.m. ET. Among stocks, Dow component Merck rose 3.2 percent to $61.84 premarket after the FDA agreed to a speedy review of the company's application to combine immunotherapy with other drugs to treat lung cancer. AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers, which are also developing similar therapies, were down 1.2 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively. Mylan rose nearly 2 percent to $39.72 after the FDA accepted a biologics license application for the company and Biocon's proposed biosimilar to treat breast cancer.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 11 January 2017 | MYT 11:19 PM Merck lifts Dow; S&P, Nasdaq flat ahead of Trump speech At 9:37am ET (Wednesday), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 26.22 points, or 0.13%, at 19,881.75. The AFP photo shows traders working on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. NEW YORK: Healthcare stocks boost the Dow early on Wednesday, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were flat ahead of Donald Trump’s first formal news conference, where he is expected to give more insight into his plans to boost economic growth. The US President-elect, who takes office on Jan 20, is scheduled to speak in New York at 11:00am ET (1600 GMT). Trump’s election in November sparked a record-setting rally. But, investors now want evidence on if and how he keeps his campaign-trail promises of stimulating the economy though increased public spending, tax cuts and repatriating US companies’ funds from overseas. The dollar, which has also basked in Trump’s victory, rose to 102.53. However, concerns over some of his protectionist statements have kept investors wary. Oil prices also helped keep the equity market afloat, rising for the first time in three days after Saudi Arabia provided details of a February supply cut to some of its Asian customers. “The overall technical picture for the stock market remains firm and we look for commodities to be the market leaders of the day, thereby, keeping the markets upward trend in place,” Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial, said in a note. Investors are also closely watching the corporate earnings season, which kicks off with big banks on Friday, to see if financial results can support the lofty valuations Wall Street is trading at. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is estimated to have risen 5.8% in the fourth quarter - the best in three years - largely helped by financials stocks, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. At 9:37am ET (1437 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was up 26.22 points, or 0.13%, at 19,881.75 and the S&P 500 was down 0.53 point, or 0.02%, at 2,268.37. The Nasdaq was down 1.58 points, or 0.03%, at 5,550.24. Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the healthcare sector’s 0.25% rise the biggest boost. The sector is set for its seventh straight day of gains. Merck surged nearly 5% to US$62.89 after the FDA agreed to a speedy review of the company’s application to combine immunotherapy with other drugs to treat lung cancer. The stock gave the biggest push to the S&P and the Dow. AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers, which are also developing similar therapies, dropped 0.7% and 1.4%, respectively. Rite Aid rose 3.8% to US$8.64 after the NY Post reported that the drugstore operator’s deal to be acquired by Walgreens would be approved this month. Walgreens rose 1.7%. New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley is expected to speak on banking regulations at 01:20pm ET. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,351 to 1,179. On the Nasdaq, 1,263 issues fell and 873 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed five new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 31 new highs and six new lows. - Reuters You May Be Interested Boosting women's libido Glass discards now included in waste separation law Better rates via online forex services Paying high interest rates for personal loans Purple should be your favourite CNY colour Chinese herb Dang Shen helps to boost strength Others Also Read Lebanese Ghaddar re-signs for third spell with Kelantan PCs on the rise Do we really need to fear China money?

REUTERS/Lucas JacksonMore By Sinead Carew NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended higher after a choppy day on Wednesday as energy and technology gains countered a drop in healthcare stocks after President-elect Donald Trump said pharmaceutical companies were "getting away with murder" by charging high prices. The Nasdaq ended the day with another record closing high after falling as much as 0.5 percent after Trump's first formal news conference since the Nov. 8 election. The S&P 500 healthcare index <.SPXHC> ended the session down 1 percent after falling as much as 1.9 percent earlier in the day and the Nasdaq biotechnology index <.NBI> sank 2.96 percent, ending a six-day winning streak for both indexes. "When somebody that high profile says something that negative, people do not want to invest in it. They view the sector as uninvestible, and withdraw their money," Brad Loncar, manager of the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF . However, the sector's pain eased as the session wore on as money managers noted that Trump gave no new specific details on his healthcare proposals, according to Michael Scanlon, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management in Boston. He cited the beginning of fourth-quarter earnings season on Friday and Trump's inauguration as President on Jan. 20 as reasons for investor caution. "Portfolio managers have every reason in the world to sit on their hands," said Scanlon. "You put those two factors together and I don't think you're going to see much movement in the market until maybe we get some fireworks on Friday with earnings." The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> closed up 98.75 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,954.28, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 6.42 points, or 0.28 percent, to 2,275.32 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.83 points, or 0.21 percent, to 5,563.65.Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors ended the day higher. Energy stocks <.SPNY>, ended 1.2 percent higher as crude oil prices rose. [O/R] The S&P's technology index <.SPLRCT> ended up 0.7 percent, boosted most by Microsoft Corp , Facebook Inc and Apple Inc . The biggest drag on the S&P's healthcare sector was Bristol-Meyers Squibb's with a 5.3 percent decline, after news that Merck & Co. leapfrogged its rivals in the race to combine immunotherapy with other drugs as a treatment for lung cancer. The next-biggest weights on the sector included Johnson & Johnson , with a 1.2 percent drop and Abbvie with a 3.6 percent decline. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.20-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.22-to-1 ratio favoured advancers. The S&P 500 posted 20 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 99 new highs and 18 new lows.

Meet the Contributors → Pain Drug Developer Adynxx Picks Up $16M for Another Clinical Trial Frank Vinluan January 10th, 2017 @frankvinluan @xconomy Like Us Xconomy San Francisco —  Despite the wide range of pain relievers available, many patients find these drugs fall short of easing pain after surgery and during rehabilitation. Drug developer Adynxx is trying to address that pain with a new treatment developed to be administered to patients during surgery. The San Francisco-based biotech now has $16 million to continue testing its approach. TPG Biotech, a new investor in the company, led the $16 million Series B round of funding. Domain Associates, which backed Adynxx’s $18 million Series A round in 2010, also participated in the latest financing. Adynxx’s lead drug, AYX1, is administered as a spinal injection. When the company began clinical trials in 2012, Adynxx CEO Rick Orr told Xconomy that the company’s drug works by blocking a protein that acts like a master switch for multiple pain signaling pathways. Orr said that this approach could have the effect of preventing pain, rather than just treating it. The idea of preventing post-surgical pain caught the eye of Cubist Pharmaceuticals, which paid $20 million in 2013 for the right to acquire Adynxx pending mid-stage clinical trial results. But after getting a look at those results in 2014, Cubist passed on its option to buy the company, saying that the “magnitude of the clinical response did not meet Cubist’s exercise criteria.” Cubist itself was acquired by Merck (NYSE: MRK) later that year. To date, Adynxx has completed two Phase 2 proof-of-concept studies. Following the most recent study in 2015, which enrolled 120 patients who had knee replacement surgery, Adynxx said that a statistically significant number of patients treated with the drug reported less pain in a walking test compared against those given a placebo. Adynxx also said its drug met the secondary goal of reducing pain while these patients were at rest. With no acquirer or partner standing by, Adynxx must go into Phase 3 clinical trials on its own. But first, the company is preparing yet another mid-stage study. The previous Phase 2 trials tested the Adynxx drug in different dosages. The company has now settled on a 660 milligram dose administered as a 6 milliliter injection, according to records filed on clinicaltrials.gov. Adynxx plans to test that dose in 200 knee replacement patients randomized to receive the Adynxx drug or a placebo. The $16 milion Series B round will help fund that study.

Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, is scheduled to speak in New York at 11:00 a.m. ET (1600 GMT). Trump's election in November sparked a record-setting rally. But, investors now want evidence on if and how he keeps his campaign-trail promises of stimulating the economy though increased public spending, tax cuts and repatriating U.S. companies' funds from overseas. The dollar, which has also basked in Trump's victory, was up against the yen. However, concerns of some of his protectionist statements have kept investors wary. Keeping futures afloat were oil prices, which edged up for the first time in three days after Saudi Arabia provided details of a February supply cut to some of its Asian customers. "The overall technical picture for the stock market remains firm and we look for commodities to be the market leaders of the day, thereby, keeping the markets upward trend in place," Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial, said in a note. Dow e-minis were up 2 points, or 0.01 percent at 8:47 a.m. ET, with 21,832 contracts changing hands. S&P 500 e-minis were down 2 points, or 0.09 percent, with 123,587 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 0.75 points, or 0.01 percent, on volume of 19,484 contracts. Investors are also closely watching the corporate earnings season, which kicks off with big banks on Friday, to see if financial results can support the lofty valuations Wall Street is trading at. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is estimated to have risen 5.8 percent in the fourth quarter - the best in three years - largely helped by financials stocks, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The S&P 500 ended flat on Tuesday, while the Nasdaq logged a record close due to gains in healthcare and technology stocks. New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley is expected to speak on banking regulations at 01:20 p.m. ET. Among stocks, Dow component Merck rose 3.2 percent to $61.84 premarket after the FDA agreed to a speedy review of the company's application to combine immunotherapy with other drugs to treat lung cancer. AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers, which are also developing similar therapies, were down 1.2 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively. Mylan rose nearly 2 percent to $39.72 after the FDA accepted a biologics license application for the company and Biocon's proposed biosimilar to treat breast cancer.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 8:30 PM, January 11, 2017 Updated: 7:00 AM, January 12, 2017 NEW YORK - U.S. stocks ended higher after a choppy day on Wednesday as energy and technology gains countered a drop in healthcare stocks after President-elect Donald Trump said pharmaceutical companies were "getting away with murder" by charging high prices. The Nasdaq ended the day with another record closing high after falling as much as 0.5 percent after Trump's first formal news conference since the Nov. 8 election. The S&P 500 healthcare index <.SPXHC> ended the session down 1 percent after falling as much as 1.9 percent earlier in the day and the Nasdaq biotechnology index <.NBI> sank 2.96 percent, ending a six-day winning streak for both indexes. "When somebody that high profile says something that negative, people do not want to invest in it. They view the sector as uninvestible, and withdraw their money," Brad Loncar, manager of the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF <CNCR.O>. However, the sector's pain eased as the session wore on as money managers noted that Trump gave no new specific details on his healthcare proposals, according to Michael Scanlon, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management in Boston. He cited the beginning of fourth-quarter earnings season on Friday and Trump's inauguration as President on Jan. 20 as reasons for investor caution. "Portfolio managers have every reason in the world to sit on their hands," said Scanlon. "You put those two factors together and I don't think you're going to see much movement in the market until maybe we get some fireworks on Friday with earnings." The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> closed up 98.75 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,954.28, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 6.42 points, or 0.28 percent, to 2,275.32 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.83 points, or 0.21 percent, to 5,563.65.Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors ended the day higher. Energy stocks <.SPNY>, ended 1.2 percent higher as crude oil <CLc1> <LCOc1> prices rose. The S&P's technology index <.SPLRCT> ended up 0.7 percent, boosted most by Microsoft Corp <MSFT.O>, Facebook Inc <FB.O> and Apple Inc <AAPL.O>. The biggest drag on the S&P's healthcare sector was Bristol-Meyers Squibb's <BMY.N> with a 5.3 percent decline, after news that Merck & Co. leapfrogged its rivals in the race to combine immunotherapy with other drugs as a treatment for lung cancer. The next-biggest weights on the sector included Johnson & Johnson <JNJ.N>, with a 1.2 percent drop and Abbvie <ABBV.N> with a 3.6 percent decline. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.20-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.22-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 20 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 99 new highs and 18 new lows. About 7.2 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Wednesday compared with the 6.57 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

But the fact of the matter is, with bond yields low and the bond proxy sectors like utilities and real estate investment trusts (REITS) set to underperform, the choices are limited. There is an investment vehicle that may offer investors a way to stay in equities, get paid solid dividends and have the potential for outperforming total return. A new research report from Merrill Lynch’s outstanding technical research analyst Stephen Suttmeier points outs some very interesting performance facts on the 10 highest yielding stocks that make up the Dogs of the Dow. The average yield for this year’s 2017 Dogs of the Dow is 3.56%. That figure is over a half percentage point or 50 basis points higher than the 30-year U.S. Treasury Bond. The Dogs of the Dow beat the S&P 500 soundly in 2016 with a total return of 20.5%, versus the venerable index’s 12%. Total return is the increase in share prices plus the dividend yield added together. All 10 stocks that made up the 2016 Dogs of the Dow had positive returns in 2016. Eight of those stocks in the group also beat the S&P 500. The Dow Jones High Yield Select 10 Total Return Index (MUTR), which is a proxy for the Dog of the Dow, has had an average annual total return of 9.2% going back to 2001. That compares with the S&P 500 total return figure for that same time period of 7.2%. Despite the outstanding returns of the Dogs of the Dow both collectively and individually last year, there are only two changes to the portfolio. A big reason for that of course is that the stocks are the highest yielding in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. We recently did an in-depth look at the stocks that make up this year’s Dogs of the Dow, carefully examining each of the stocks that are in the portfolio. Suttmeier is a technical research analyst at Merrill Lynch, so his work is concentrated on the technicals, which included trading volume, stock movement on a positive and negative basis, and overall chart activity. His work notes that most of the companies in the Dogs of the Dow are anywhere from so-so to very positive. He does point out that both Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO) and Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) are somewhat weaker technically than the other constituents. The good thing for investors, especially those with more conservative accounts, is this portfolio is chock full of large cap companies that have been around for years. The risk factor is far lower, and it is important to remember that these stocks are in the portfolio because they are the highest yielding in the 30 Dow components. Relative to their peers in the index, they should be lower priced. One good way for investors to own the Dogs of the Dow may be the ELEMENTS Dog of the Dow High Yield Select 10 Total Return Exchange Traded Note (NYSE: DOD). This is an ETN option that provides investors a pure play to the 10 highest dividend-yielding securities in Dow Jones Industrial Average in equal proportions, but will not pay the dividends. It closely replicates the Dow Jones High Yield Select 10 Total Return Index and charges 75 basis points, three-quarters of 1%, in annual fees. Buying all 10 stocks at a brokerage firm, even it’s a discount firm, would be very expensive, so this clearly makes the most sense. To own the actual stocks in the Dogs of the Dow, investors should consider a unit trust, which will own the stocks for a calendar year and then reset the portfolio every year as changes are made. Investors are charged once a year. Top companies like Invesco and First Trust offer these every year, and they can be purchased through full service or discount brokers. While there is no guarantee the Dogs of the Dow will outperform again, it is a great way for investors to own top high-quality stocks, receive dividends and have less volatility than other investment avenues.

The experiment which was conducted in Guinea indicates that the vaccine – rVSV-ZEBOV – is the first to prevent infection from one of the most lethal known pathogens. The vaccine was studied in a trial involving 1, 1841 people in Guinea during 2015. Among the 5,837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination. In comparison, there were 23 cases 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine. The trial was led by WHO, together with Guinea’s Ministry of Health, Medecins Sans Frontières and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, in collaboration with other international partners. “While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa’s Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless,” Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO’s Assistant Director-General for Health Systems & Innovation and the study’s lead author, said. The vaccine’s manufacturer, Merck, Sharpe & Dohme, this year received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration and PRIME status from the European Medicines Agency, enabling faster regulatory review of the vaccine once it is submitted. Since Ebola virus was first identified in 1976, sporadic outbreaks have been reported in Africa. But, the 2013–2016 West African Ebola outbreak which resulted in more than 11, 300 deaths highlighted the need for a vaccine. The trial took place in the coastal region of Basse-Guinée, the area of Guinea still experiencing new Ebola cases when the trial started in 2015. The trial used an innovative design, a so-called ‘ring vaccination’ approach – the same method used to eradicate small pox. In addition to showing high efficacy among those vaccinated, the trial also shows that unvaccinated people in the rings were indirectly protected from Ebola virus through the ring vaccination approach (so called ‘herd immunity’). “Ebola left a devastating legacy in our country. We are proud that we have been able to contribute to developing a vaccine that will prevent other nations from enduring what we endured,” Dr Keïta Sakoba, Coordinator of the Ebola Response and Director of the National Agency for Health Security in Guinea, said.  BY Jamila Akweley Okertchiri   Tags: health Share this article: Previous Post Meet Ete Dakitse… The ‘True Love’ Singer Next Post No NDC Kind Of Lawlessness - Trust H.E.

The Nasdaq ended the day with another record closing high after falling as much as 0.5 percent after Trump's first formal news conference since the Nov. 8 election. The S&P 500 healthcare index .SPXHC ended the session down 1 percent after falling as much as 1.9 percent earlier in the day and the Nasdaq biotechnology index .NBI sank 2.96 percent, ending a six-day winning streak for both indexes. "When somebody that high profile says something that negative, people do not want to invest in it. They view the sector as uninvestible, and withdraw their money," Brad Loncar, manager of the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF (CNCR.O). However, the sector's pain eased as the session wore on as money managers noted that Trump gave no new specific details on his healthcare proposals, according to Michael Scanlon, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management in Boston. He cited the beginning of fourth-quarter earnings season on Friday and Trump's inauguration as President on Jan. 20 as reasons for investor caution. "Portfolio managers have every reason in the world to sit on their hands," said Scanlon. "You put those two factors together and I don't think you're going to see much movement in the market until maybe we get some fireworks on Friday with earnings." The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI closed up 98.75 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,954.28, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 6.42 points, or 0.28 percent, to 2,275.32 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 11.83 points, or 0.21 percent, to 5,563.65.Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors ended the day higher. Energy stocks .SPNY, ended 1.2 percent higher as crude oil CLc1 LCOc1 prices rose. The S&P's technology index .SPLRCT ended up 0.7 percent, boosted most by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O). The biggest drag on the S&P's healthcare sector was Bristol-Meyers Squibb's (BMY.N) with a 5.3 percent decline, after news that Merck & Co. leapfrogged its rivals in the race to combine immunotherapy with other drugs as a treatment for lung cancer. The next-biggest weights on the sector included Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), with a 1.2 percent drop and Abbvie (ABBV.N) with a 3.6 percent decline. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.20-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.22-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 20 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 99 new highs and 18 new lows. About 7.2 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Wednesday compared with the 6.57 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

However, concerns of some of his protectionist statements have kept investors wary. * Keeping futures afloat were oil prices, which edged up for the first time in three days after Saudi Arabia provided details of a February supply cut to some of its Asian customers. * Investors are also closely watching the upcoming corporate earnings season, which kicks off with big banks on Friday, to see if financial results can support the lofty valuations Wall Street is trading at. * The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is estimated to have risen 5.8 percent in the fourth quarter - the best in three years - largely helped by financials stocks, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. * New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley is expected to speak on banking regulations at 01:20 p.m. ET. * Among stocks, Merck rose 1.85 percent to $61.03 premarket after the FDA agreed to a speedy review of the company's application to combine immunotherapy with other drugs to treat lung cancer. * AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers, which are also developing similar therapies, were down 1.5 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively. * Archer Daniels fell 5.6 percent to $41.96 after China increased punitive tariffs on U.S. imports of an animal feed which would affect the global ethanol trader. Futures snapshot at 6:53 a.m. ET: * Dow e-minis were up 13 points, or 0.07 percent, with 17,569 contracts changing hands. * S&P 500 e-minis were up 0.5 points, or 0.02 percent, with 91,723 contracts traded. * Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 4.5 points, or 0.09 percent, on volume of 15,161 contracts.

Bypassing sporting stadiums and race-car tracks, Biden's first official stop in the world's sporting capital was to open a $737 million cancer center. As head of America's cancer "moonshot" initiative, and having lost his son Beau to brain cancer, Biden has spent the last year of his term exploring ways to "end cancer as we know it." That his quest took him 10,000 miles to the Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre is an endorsement of Australia's medical-science prowess and a new plan to expand its reach. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Mining has been the growth engine for Australia's economy for years. As demand for the nation's mineral resources declines, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is boosting life-science research funds, offering tax breaks and wooing international talent to exploit the scientific capital that's enabled the country to claim more than a dozen Nobel laureates. "We were collecting pieces of intellectual property and just handing it over — 'here you are' — to investors," recalls Amanda Caples of her time working in drug development in Melbourne in the early 2000s. At the time, the life sciences industry was following mining's path of "digging it up and selling it," she said. Now, as lead scientist in Victoria, the state of which Melbourne is the capital, Caples has seen "a shift in aspirations," she said. "We're adding the 'on-shore processing'" by advancing research beyond the discovery stage. Doing so requires funds that often eluded inventors. Cervical cancer vaccines, for example, rely on groundbreaking research on the human papilloma virus from doctors in Brisbane, who collaborated with Melbourne-based CSL Ltd. on early studies. The shots were taken through late-stage clinical tests and commercialized abroad by pharmaceutical giants Merck & Co. and GlaxoSmithKline. Turnbull, a former Goldman Sachs Group executive, aims to avoid missing such money-making opportunities with the launch this month of A$250 million for a Biomedical Translational Fund. The funds were allocated in December to three venture capital firms: Brandon Capital Partners, OneVentures Management and BioScience Managers. The investments will help companies take their promising treatment candidates further along the three-stage clinical trial process instead of being forced to license them at early development stages to companies with more money, said Chris Nave, managing director of Melbourne-based Brandon Capital. Nave's fund received close to half of the government's allocation — A$115 million — which is being matched by its pension fund investors. "For the first time, the Australian biotech industry has access to sufficient amounts of capital to support late stage development," said Nave, a former scientist who switched to helping universities garner funding from external investors. "It's transformative." "There's a real opportunity that the next Genentech or Amgen will be built in Australia," Nave said, referring to the U.S. biotechnology giants. The nation is good at generating science-based intellectual property, for which there are few local competitors at least for now, he said. "We're not all walking down the same corridors, fighting for deals here," he added. The same advantage is felt at the headquarters of CSL, Asia-Pacific's biggest drugmaker by market value, which is located across a park from the cancer center Biden opened in Melbourne's medical precinct. » Next page...

Business Biotech Health care opportunities and perils in Trump presidency, panel says Jane Axlerad, a former FDA official, speaks at the 2017 Biotech Showcase in San Francisco. Bradley J.

FikesContact Reporter President-elect Donald Trump can make significant improvements in health by planning for emergencies such as Ebola and by following through on a new bipartisan law to improve development of new disease treatments, according to panelists at this week's massive biotech convention in San Francisco. While critical of Trump to varying degrees -- no one who endorsed Trump for the presidency were on the panel — the speakers said Trump has an unusual opportunity to fix important issues that have bedeviled both major parties. The panelists spoke Tuesday at the annual Biotech Showcase conference, one of the events that bring top life science executives and investors to San Francisco every January. Former Senator Norm Coleman moderated the discussion. The new bipartisan law, the 21st Century Cures Act, was passed by Congress and on Dec. 13 signed into law by President Obama. It provides the National Institutes of Health with billions in additional funding to advance President Obama’s Precision Medicine Initiative to more fully develop customized treatments for individuals, and to help Vice President Joe Biden’s cancer moonshot initiative. However, a number of key health care officials are leaving when President Obama’s term ends Jan. 20, said panelist Jane Axelrad, who recently retired from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. That means there will be a loss of continuity just as the new law is getting under way, said Axelrad, who was the FDA’s regulatory drug policy chief until she left the agency in April 2016. Expect the unexpected with epidemics Plan now for health emergencies such as Ebola, said Julie Geberding, M.D. an executive vice president at the pharmaceutical company Merck. Plan now for health emergencies such as Ebola, said Julie Geberding, M.D. an executive vice president at the pharmaceutical company Merck. See more videos “There’s going to be a need to recruit new staff,” Axelrad said. “I think that’s going to be difficult for the agency, which traditionally has had a very difficult time hiring and retained qualified people. This was one of the issues addressed in (the act), which gave the agency sweeping new hiring and pay authority. “But there’s a question of what that’s going to mean under the new administration. (Trump) has talked about imposing a government-wide hiring freeze. We don’t know whether there will be exceptions.” Trump can best deal with disease outbreaks by selecting an experienced health expert to craft a response plan, said Julie Geberding, M.D. an executive vice president at the pharmaceutical company Merck. Most of the recent secretaries of Health and Human Services have been hit with an unexpected crisis, Gerberding said, ticking off the names and crises. “Tommy Thompson (for George W. Bush) got anthrax, Secretary Sebelius (for President Obama) got a flu pandemic, and Secretary Burwell (also for Obama) got Ebola,” said Gerberding, an infectious disease specialist and former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). “And when you have new administrations, there’s a tendency to … over-promise and take control of situations with people who don’t know what they’re doing,” she added. “It would be naive to think that this president-elect won’t have to deal with some sort of biopreparedness issue,” she said. “Whether it’s intentional or natural doesn’t really matter. The apparatus of government needs to pull into action. It’s complex and requires a fairly sophisticated understanding of how agencies and departments can work together.” Geberding said Trump can use the infrastructure stimulus he has proposed to improve health while helping the economy. “When you’re building roads, build sidewalks and safe crosswalks. Put some of that incredible economic investment that will go into our cities and even some our rural areas into things that build a healthier environment and nudge people into better health.” Such a plan was considered with President Obama’s economic stimulus package, she said, but the idea wasn’t acted on.

Note that taken together, results from two trials failed to make a case for further investigation of cetuximab in combination with chemoradiation for anal cancer, according to the authors of an accompanying editorial. Patients with high-risk squamous cell anal cancer had a moderate reduction in locoregional failure but a substantial increase in toxicity with the addition of cetuximab (Erbitux) to standard chemoradiation, a multicenter clinical trial showed. A fourth of patients had locoregional failure at 3 years, as compared with an expected rate of 35% derived from historical data. A third of the 61 patients had grade 4 toxicity, and three treatment-related deaths occurred, reported Joseph A. Sparano, MD, of Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, and colleagues. "Although these findings suggest that the addition of cetuximab to chemoradiation therapy for anal cancer may reduce locoregional failure rates, toxicity was substantial, and locoregional failure still occurs in approximately 20%, indicating the continued need for more effective and less toxic therapies," they wrote online in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. "Although cetuximab improved clinical outcomes when added to radiation therapy in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, similar benefit was not observed when cetuximab was added to cisplatin plus radiation therapy in this population, suggesting that the evaluation of cetuximab plus radiation therapy without chemotherapy may also be considered an option in future trials." A small multicenter trial of patients with HIV-associated anal cancer, conducted by Sparano, Madhur Garg, MD, also of Montefiore, and colleagues, demonstrated a 3-year locoregional failure rate of 42% with the addition of cetuximab to chemoradiation, and a fourth of the patients had grade 4 toxicity. Taken together, the two trials failed to make a case for further investigation of cetuximab in combination with chemoradiation for anal cancer, according to the authors of an accompanying editorial, who also noted that chemoradiation is not standard of care for anal cancer. "The toxicity and 5% death rate in both studies will deter both wider adoption and further testing in larger phase III trials, despite the modestly encouraging locoregional failure rate," said Rob Glynne-Jones, MD, and Mark Harrison, MD, of the Center for Cancer Treatment and Mount Vernon Hospital in Northwood, England. "Future trials should be specifically designed for patients with both human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative and HPV-positive squamous cell carcinoma of the anus, stratified according to smoking habit and different TNM staging, and ideally should have different therapeutic goals," Glynne-Jones and Harrison added. "Successful validation of these approaches will allow for more effective selection of individualized treatment of patients, in both the context of routine care and clinical trials." Sphincter-sparing definitive chemoradiation offers a potential to cure squamous cell anal cancer. However, about a third of patients have locoregional failure, which is associated with significant morbidity, risk of distant recurrence, and mortality, the authors noted. The rationale for evaluating cetuximab in anal cancer came from observations that the EGFR inhibitor enhances radiation therapy activity in HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. About two-thirds of anal cancers occur in HPV-positive individuals. Sparano's group reported findings from a phase II cooperative group trial involving immunocompetent patients with stage I-III squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal. After accrual of 28 patients, investigators revised eligibility criteria to limit enrollment to patients with high-risk stage II, IIIA, or IIIB disease. The trial had a primary objective of locoregional failure, and investigators hypothesized that the addition of cetuximab would reduce the failure rate at 3 years by 50% as compared with a historical 3-year locoregional failure rate of 35%. Two-thirds of the patients had stage III disease, and most had other high-risk features. Women accounted for 80% of the study population. The results showed a 3-year locoregional failure rate of 23% (95% CI 13-36%, P=0.03) by binomial proportional estimate, using the prespecified endpoint. A post hoc Kaplan-Meier analysis yielded an estimated 3-year locoregional failure rate of 21%. The progression-free and overall survival at 3 years were 68% and 83%, respectively. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events among 62 patients who received at least one dose of treatment were diarrhea (68%, all grade 3), neutropenia (50%, 24% grade 4), nausea (32%), dehydration (32%, all grade 4), and hypokalemia (24%). The type and frequency of adverse events were generally similar between the first 28 patients and the 34 enrolled after the modification of eligibility criteria. The trial of HIV-associated anal cancer involved 45 patients with stage I-III disease. All patients received cetuximab concurrently with cisplatin-fluorouracil chemotherapy, along with irradiation of the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes. As in the trial of immunocompetent patients, investigators hypothesized that the addition of cetuximab would reduce locoregional failure by 50% at 3 years. The binomial proportional estimate of locoregional failure was 42%. Post hoc Kaplan-Meier analysis yielded a 3-year estimate of 20%. In addition to a 26% incidence of grade 4 toxicity, two (4%) treatment-related deaths occurred. The study of by Garg's group was supported by the National Cancer Institute and the NIH.

And in 2016, only 36 biotech and pharmaceutical companies went public in the U.S., compared with 68 in 2015 and a record 85 in 2014. The long drought comes ahead of the health care industry’s biggest gathering of companies and investors, the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, which began Monday. The week before the massive conference typically serves as a launchpad for fresh offerings. This year? Nothing. “Biotech had a difficult year generally from a performance perspective, and so a bunch of the generalists have exited the market and money’s become much tighter,” said Bryan Roberts, a partner at Venrock, a technology and health care venture capital firm with about $3.1 billion under management. “When people’s comfort with risk goes down, IPOs are one of the first things to fall off the edge of the cliff.” There are several reasons at play. The market has been in a slump: The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index of 164 companies was down 22 percent in 2016, the first yearlong losing streak since 2008 and the worst year since 2002. And with a new president taking office and promising to cut taxes and overhaul the health care system, bankers and investors may be choosing to wait and see. “I think in the 2014 to 2015 period we were a bit spoiled as an industry,” said David Sabow, a managing director at Silicon Valley Bank. “After two consecutive years of a very liquid market, we thought that may be the new normal, but 2016 showed us that was not the case.” Only $444.1 million was raised in U.S.-listed biotechnology and pharmaceutical IPOs during the fourth quarter of 2016 and seven companies went public, according to Bloomberg data. In 2016, seven U.S. biotechnology and drug companies announced their intent to go public in the first eight days of the year. Not a single one has raised their hand so far this January. Bruce Booth, a partner at investment firm Atlas Venture, said he’s not worried about that holdup. “If the ‘new normal’ is a steady flow of 25-plus biotech IPOs each year, that would be a sign of a very healthy, maturing sector,” Booth said. “We should start to see a few IPOs by the end of January or early February. I’d anticipate four to five of them by the end of February.” Booth’s fund, which manages around $700 million, has investments in gene-editing firm Intellia Therapeutics Inc. and cancer drugmaker Unum Therapeutics Inc. There could also be a pickup thanks to the broader stock market surge that has followed President-elect Donald Trump’s election victory. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index is up 6.4 percent since the Nov. 8 election day. “CEO confidence is a critical factor in driving M&A,” said Richard Landgarten, Barclays PLC’s head of health care and real estate banking. “Right now they feel good about the stock market broadly and, for example, the potential for pro-business tax reform from the new administration.” Several biotech names have been floated for 2017 IPOs, including Jounce Therapeutics and Braeburn Pharmaceuticals, which have announced their intention to go public in the coming year without giving an exact date. IPOs could also be prodded if takeovers increase in the industry. Big drugmakers have been sitting on cash left overseas, waiting on potential tax reform from Trump and Republicans in Congress. They’ve promised to lower rates, which could help repatriate $98 billion of overseas cash among large pharmaceutical companies, according to Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford. Johnson & Johnson has about $40 billion overseas, followed by Merck & Co. with about $20 billion, then Pfizer with nearly $15 billion, according Holford’s Nov. 9 note to clients. Some of that money will stay invested abroad, and the rest could be brought back for potential acquisitions. “The smartest money in this space is watching the first 100 days” of the Trump administration, said Sabow. Andy Weisenfeld, a partner at health care investment banking firm MTS Health Partners LP, said he expects 2017 to be similar to 2016, with drugmakers letting smaller biotechs take the risks of research and development, then stepping in to snap up experimental products once they’ve proved themselves. “Prices for the better targets might go up, but if something hasn’t been de-risked, I think for the most part these companies would rather pay more and have it de-risked than pay real money and have it fail,” Weisenfeld said.

The financial sector fell 0.8 percent today. It had risen almost 18 percent since the election, led by banking stocks. ASSOCIATED PRESS THE BLADE Buy This Image Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print NEW YORK — Declines in energy and financial stocks weighed on the S&P 500 today and helped stall the Dow's pursuit of the 20,000 milestone ahead of earnings season and expected U.S. policy changes under the Donald Trump presidency. The Nasdaq notched a record high close, extending its bullish run with help from healthcare stocks. The S&P's energy sector dropped 1.5 percent as oil prices slid on concerns that rising Iraqi exports and U.S. output could dampen the impact of a deal among major producers to limit output. THE BLADE Enlarge | Buy This Image RELATED: Searchable stock index Elsewhere, investors were taking a breather ahead of fourth-quarter earnings and the Jan. 20 presidential inauguration. The S&P 500 benchmark has risen more than 6 percent since the Nov. 8 election of Donald Trump, who has pledged tax cuts, lighter regulation and fiscal stimulus, but investors are now waiting to see if he can deliver on those promises. “People are waiting for more information. We're waiting for political news, we're waiting for earnings. There's a lot of uncertainty out there. As the month goes on I expect we'll see some movement,” said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. The financial sector fell 0.8 percent today. It had risen almost 18 percent since the election, led by banking stocks. Big banks will provide the first peek into how U.S. companies fared in the fourth quarter later this week. S&P 500 companies overall are expected to post a 5.8 percent increase in profit in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “There is some hope we'll see some movement upward. Investors want to see some of those reports come out first," said Jankovskis. Two-thirds of the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average components fell, keeping the psychologically significant 20,000 mark at bay. Goldman Sachs’ 0.8 percent fall was its biggest drag followed by International Business Machine's 0.9 percent drop and Exxon Mobil's 1.7 percent decline. The Dow had come tantalizingly close to the milestone on Friday, hitting a peak of 19,999.63, as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also touched records after a late pop in tech stocks. “Our view about the Dow (hitting) 20,000 is not a matter of if, but a matter of when,” said Matt Jones, U.S. head of equity strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 76.42 points, or 0.38 percent, to 19,887.38, the S&P 500 had lost 8.08 points, or 0.354856 percent, to 2,268.9 and the Nasdaq Composite had added 10.76 points, or 0.19 percent, to 5,531.82. Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower. The S&P's health sector was the biggest gainer with Merck & Co. the leading boost and Vertex Pharmaceuticals the biggest percentage gainer with a 4.4 pct jump after it issued guidance. Nasdaq's biggest drivers in the healthcare sector were Ariad Pharmaceuticals, which closed up 72.9 percent on a $5.20 billion buyout deal with Japan's Takeda 4502.T Incyte with a 9.4 percent jump after it announced advancements in its cancer drug program with Merck. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.77-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 6 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 55 new highs and 16 new lows. About 6.4 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges today compared with the 6.6 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

(Onvia Photo) Russ Mann, a longtime fixture in Seattle’s tech scene, is taking on another leading role. He was announced this morning as the new CEO of Seattle-based Onvia, a Seattle-based government business intelligence company.  Onvia provides a number of B2B services that serve to connect private businesses to government contracts, and provide a variety of data on government contracting to businesses in related fields. According to an Onvia press release, Mann will help accelerate the company’s growth in the coming years. “With the improved domestic economy and the incoming administration’s focus on accelerated infrastructure spending, Onvia is truly poised to expand its growth and leadership at the core of this B2G market,” D. Van Skilling, Chairman of Onvia’s Board of Directors, said in a press release. “With Russ at the helm, Onvia’s next years will be extraordinary.” Mann’s resume includes his previous position as CMO and senior vice president of e-commerce at Bellevue, Wash., based Outerwall as well as one year as the CMO of workplace automation company Nintex.

I’m excited to join Tableau on its mission.” “I’m delighted that Hilarie is joining Tableau on our mission to help people see and understand data,” Adam Selipsky, President and CEO at Tableau, said in the release. “Hilarie’s sales and marketing experience at leading SaaS companies and experience in bringing analytics technologies to IT markets will be great assets for Tableau as we work to bring data to more people at organizations all over the world.” Richard Henriques.

He is currently a senior fellow at the Center for High Impact Philanthropy and Wharton Social Impact at the University of Pennsylvania. Nativis’ technology uses ultra- low radio frequency energy to stimulate a cell’s metabolic pathways, which could potentially be used as a drug- and radiation-free therapy for cancers, among other diseases. The company is currently testing the device in brain cancer patients. “It is an honor to join Nativis’ diverse board of scientific and executive leaders. I believe that the company’s technology presents a unique opportunity for the treatment of cancers and other serious diseases,” Henriques said in a statement. “As the company advances and further develops its technology, I look forward to leveraging my experience from the Gates Foundation and Merck to help guide Nativis to a successful future.” David McShea.

These types of organizations exist for start-ups, but are few and far between for entrepreneurs who face common issues related to leading and growing their businesses.” Clare McGrane is a GeekWire reporter who covers life sciences, biotechnology and general assignment technology stories, in addition to producing the GeekWire radio show and podcast.

This report list all the medicine in clinical trial and their design and the population recruited.     Spread the Word Listed Under Tags: • Global Essential Oil Market • Pure Essential Oils • World Essential Oils Industry: • Medical Location: • Mumbai - Maharashtra - India Subject: • ReportsMUMBAI, India - Jan. 10, 2017 - PRLog -- Sales of Hepatitis C crossed ~$10bn in 2014 proving that treatments for liver disease could become mega-blockbusters and Non-Alcoholic SteatoHepatitis (NASH) is expected to be equally lucrative. Improved diagnosis rate and change in treatment guidelines along with defined clinical trials endpoint are the concerns for the emerging therapy. US FDA is expected to release guidelines for the clinical trial in CY16 and this should accelerate the development of the targeting NASH. NASH is the progressive form of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease – NAFLD. While NASH can reverse itself, in many cases, the resulting liver scarring causes a patient's liver to harden and failure to work properly. It is estimated that NASH affects 2 to 5% of the US population. Other developed countries such as Europe and Japan also have similar or higher incidence of NASH disease. Due to the varying physical and metabolism traits across various geographies, development  for Non-Alcoholic SteatoHepatitis(NASH) is facing difficulty. In Japan, the prevalence of NASH is rising although the population is not typically overweight. Countries like India and China with bigger population and changes in lifestyles face a greater risk of NASH along with other lifestyle diseases like Diabetes and Cardiovascular related complexities. As per the US Association of Liver Disease, of those who develop NASH, ~15-25% will progress to end stage liver disease (ESLD) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) over 10-20 years. Today, 1/3rd of Liver transplants and HCC are caused by NASH and the total cost burden of this on US is over ~$5 billion per year. Only new treatments in NASH could lead to a cut in this major cost burden along with improving quality of life. Since a new innovation in NASH has been enlightened, the interest in companies developing  for NASH has also gone up. In Jan. 2015, Gilead Sciences (GILD) acquired Phenex Pharma's Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) program comprising small molecule FXR agonists for the treatment of liver diseases including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and other Liver Diseases.  Merck-NGM Biopharma and Boehringer Ingelheim - Pharmaxis also entered into an exclusive agreement for the pipeline products which are being developed for NASH with a potential deal value of ~$450-600mn. This report will provide detailed analysis on NASH disease and in development in broader pharma market. This report list all the  in clinical trial and their design and the population recruited, also tells about the pathways representing possible targets for the treatment of NASH.

REUTERS/Andrew KellyMore By Sinead Carew (Reuters) - Declines in energy and financial stocks weighed on the S&P 500 on Monday and helped stall the Dow's pursuit of the 20,000 milestone ahead of earnings season and expected U.S. policy changes under the Donald Trump presidency. The Nasdaq notched a record high close, extending its bullish run with help from healthcare stocks. The S&P's energy sector <.SPNY> dropped 1.5 percent as oil prices slid on concerns that rising Iraqi exports and U.S. output could dampen the impact of a deal among major producers to limit output. [O/R] Elsewhere, investors were taking a breather ahead of fourth-quarter earnings and the Jan. 20 presidential inauguration. The S&P 500 benchmark has risen more than 6 percent since the Nov. 8 election of Donald Trump, who has pledged tax cuts, lighter regulation and fiscal stimulus, but investors are now waiting to see if he can deliver on those promises. "People are waiting for more information. We're waiting for political news, we're waiting for earnings. There's a lot of uncertainty out there. As the month goes on I expect we'll see some movement," said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. The financial sector <.SPSY> fell 0.8 percent on Monday. It had risen almost 18 percent since the election, led by banking stocks. Big banks will provide the first peek into how U.S. companies fared in the fourth quarter later this week. S&P 500 companies overall are expected to post a 5.8 percent increase in profit in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "There is some hope we'll see some movement upward. Investors want to see some of those reports come out first," said Jankovskis. Two-thirds of the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average components fell, keeping the psychologically significant 20,000 mark at bay. Goldman Sachs' 0.8 percent fall was its biggest drag followed by International Business Machine's 0.9 percent drop and Exxon Mobil's 1.7 percent decline. The Dow had come tantalisingly close to the milestone on Friday, hitting a peak of 19,999.63, as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also touched records after a late pop in tech stocks. "Our view about the Dow (hitting) 20,000 is not a matter of if, but a matter of when," said Matt Jones, U.S. head of equity strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> was down 76.42 points, or 0.38 percent, to 19,887.38, the S&P 500 <.SPX> had lost 8.08 points, or 0.354856 percent, to 2,268.9 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> had added 10.76 points, or 0.19 percent, to 5,531.82. Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower. The S&P's health sector <.SPXHC> was the biggest gainer with Merck & Co. the leading boost and Vertex Pharmaceuticals the biggest percentage gainer with a 4.4 pct jump after it issued guidance. Nasdaq's biggest drivers in the healthcare sector were Ariad Pharmaceuticals , which closed up 72.9 percent on a $5.20 billion buyout deal with Japan's Takeda 4502.T Incyte with a 9.4 percent jump after it announced advancements in its cancer drug programme with Merck. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.77-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favoured decliners. The S&P 500 posted 6 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 55 new highs and 16 new lows. About 6.4 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Monday compared with the 6.6 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

Home Industry Morgan Stanley rates Sun Pharmaceutical Industries ‘Equal-Weight’ Morgan Stanley rates Sun Pharmaceutical Industries ‘Equal-Weight’ Sun announced that its NCE drug Seciera has met phase 3 primary and secondary endpoints (in a study of 744 dry eye patients). By: Morgan Stanley | Published: January 10, 2017 6:09 AM Sun continues to bolster its specialty pipeline—Tildrakizumab (Merck), Odomzo (Novartis), MM-II (Moebius), Seciera (Ocular), Elepsia/Xelpros (SPARC), BromSite/DexaSite (Insite), Absorica (Ranbaxy), and Dusa drug products. Sun announced that its NCE drug Seciera has met phase 3 primary and secondary endpoints (in a study of 744 dry eye patients). Seciera is a patented, novel, clear, preservative-free, aqueous solution. Seciera is being developed by Ocular Technologies, a company recently acquired by Sun. It agreed to pay $40 million upfront, plus contingent development milestones and sales milestones as well as tiered royalties on sales of Seciera. Sun aims to commercialise this product in global markets including the US, Europe, and Japan, as well as several emerging markets. Clinical differentiation: The company has not yet disclosed the Phase III trials data (plus, it was not a head-to-head trial versus Restasis). Therefore, it is difficult to assess the medical benefits versus available drug options. However, according to Sun, Seciera is differentiated by early demonstration of efficacy (12 weeks) versus other approved dry eye drugs in the same class. We note that Xiidra has a faster onset of action (roughly 2 weeks, according to Shire). After 12 weeks of treatment, Seciera showed statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint, Schirmer’s score (a measurement of tear production) (p<0.0001). Adverse events reported in the trial were mild to moderate in nature and similar to those of other approved drugs in the category. Sun will continue to analyse the data and present findings at upcoming medical conferences. Roadmap ahead: Sun plans to discuss the Phase III data with the FDA to assess if more clinical work is required for this product. To note, historically, a few drug candidates have been discontinued in the regulatory pathway because data were insufficient to convince the FDA. Assuming all goes well for Sun, the company could file an NDA for Seciera in FY18 and launch the product in FY19. Sales ramp-up could take 2-3 years. In addition, based on clinical trials.gov, it is conducting more clinical studies. Completion is expected in June 2017. According to management, the global dry eye market is estimated to reach $5 bn by 2020. Our View: Sun continues to bolster its specialty pipeline—Tildrakizumab (Merck), Odomzo (Novartis), MM-II (Moebius), Seciera (Ocular), Elepsia/Xelpros (SPARC), BromSite/DexaSite (Insite), Absorica (Ranbaxy), and Dusa drug products. We remain EW on Sun in view of a slow earnings ramp-up (as gGleevec erodes and competitive intensity rises for the Taro portfolio), distant and modest upside from upcoming specialty portfolio, and full valuation. You May Also Want To Watch: Valuation methodology: Our price target of R762 is our base case scenario value, derived by applying a target multiple of 20x (~5%-10% discount to the large-cap industry average P/E) to our September 2018 EPS estimate of R38.1. This is in view of higher single-product profit concentration and slower base business sales growth progression due to US approval delays. We cite the following reasons to support our 20x target multiple: (i) FDA issuance of a warning letter at the Halol plant, leading to delay in new product approval. There could also be collateral damage in terms of brand equity with various stakeholders including customers in the US. (ii) Delay in the evolution of specialty business, especially the two lead candidates from SPARC (Elepsia XL and Xelpros) which are filed from Halol. (iii) Loss of some opportunities in the US due to now delayed ANDA approvals. (iv) Higher single-product dependence for near-term earnings growth. The aforementioned we cite versus (i) Solid base business, especially its domestic market leadership in chronic ailment therapies. This is being replicated in other emerging markets. (ii) Longer-term mid-teens US growth outlook driven by its portfolio of ~160 ANDAs pending FDA approval. (iii) New growth levers—SPARC, specialty products, Ranbaxy synergies, MK-3222. (iv) Sizable and growing net cash on the balance sheet, which could unlock value via inorganic means. (v) Deepening leadership team (Israel Makov, Kal Sundaram), which underlines Sun’s aspirations to continue to grow globally and profitably. Please Wait while comments are loading...

That code then instructs cells to make proteins to fight a disease or infection. Part of investors’ interest is the potential at Moderna and companies like it to create a whole new industry of drugs using the techniques. The company’s unveiling comes at a time of great excitement - and caution - in the sector. Venture investors have put more than $1.5bn every quarter into biotech start-ups since the end of 2014, according to data compiled by PricewaterhouseCoopers. Yet the industry has faced criticism over how new treatments are priced, and skepticism of breakthrough claims has risen following the discrediting of medical diagnostics company Theranos. Easier, cheaper Messenger RNA is relatively quick to create and can be easily mass-produced, and the hope is that mRNA therapies will be faster, cheaper alternatives to traditional biotechnology drugs, which are typically grown in labs or harvested from living organisms. "It’s almost plug-and-play," said Rick Bright, director of the US government’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, also known as BARDA. The agency, which develops countermeasures to bioterrorism, gave Moderna funding because it sees the platform as potentially being a fast responder in an emergency situation. “All you need is a sequence from a part of the virus you want to make, drop it into the basic machinery, and you could rapidly have dozens of vaccines,” Bright said. High promise It sounds simple, but to succeed Moderna will have to demonstrate that it can accurately target specific cells in different organs in the body. Moderna is working on the eye, lungs, joints and even the brain, said chief executive officer Stephane Bancel, though those programs are still in early research stages.   The company, which was was created in part by venture capital firm Flagship Pioneering, has financing to cover "three to four years" of operations and won’t seek an initial public offering this year, Bancel said. Its most advanced assets are for two strains of flu, H10N8 and H7N9, and the treatments are in early-stage human studies, the company said Monday. Both strains have barely affected humans at this point, but they have pandemic potential. "It’d be nice to have one ready to go," said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Normally, however, pharmaceutical companies don’t prepare vaccines ahead of time because there isn’t a market for them. "I’m not sure what their business plan would be," he said. Bancel said they picked the two influenzas because they’re good proof-of-concept cases with clear paths to approval by drug regulators. The company says it’s also working on vaccines for Zika, Chikungunya, human metapneumovirus and cytomegalovirus. Zika effort BARDA is backing a Zika vaccine the company is developing and Bright said he’s enthusiastic, but cautious about the potential. "There is no major safety concern," he said, "but because we have limited experience, we have to tread cautiously with the unknown." In cancer, Moderna has a previously disclosed collaboration with Merck & Company to develop personalized cancer vaccines. On Monday, it revealed two additional targets that are meant to help a patient’s immune system attack tumors, which often have developed ways of evading the body’s defences. The two targets are known as OX40L and IL-12. "The IL-12 can turn a cold tumour hot, and the OX40L decorates the tumour like a Christmas tree," said Bancel, making them vulnerable to attack. None of the cancer treatments have started human studies. Finally, Moderna is collaborating with London pharma giant AstraZeneca to develop an injection intended to stimulate blood vessel creation and improve blood supply in patients who have suffered heart failure or a heart attack. That program has started its first study in humans.Read Fin24's top stories trending on Twitter: Fin24’s top stories Follow Fin24 on Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and Pinterest. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Stocks Forex Commodities Gold & Silver Today's Pick Portfolio Tracker Oil drop stymies Dow’s march to 20,000; health stocks boost Nasdaq Reuters comments   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet Jan 9:   Declines in energy and financial stocks weighed on the S&P 500 on Monday and helped stall the Dow’s pursuit of the 20,000 milestone ahead of earnings season and expected US policy changes under the Donald Trump presidency. The Nasdaq notched a record high close, extending its bullish run with help from healthcare stocks. The S&P’s energy sector dropped 1.5 per cent as oil prices slid on concerns that rising Iraqi exports and US output could dampen the impact of a deal among major producers to limit output. Elsewhere, investors were taking a breather ahead of fourth-quarter earnings and the January 20 presidential inauguration. The S&P 500 benchmark has risen more than 6 per cent since the November 8 election of Donald Trump, who has pledged tax cuts, lighter regulation and fiscal stimulus, but investors are now waiting to see if he can deliver on those promises. “People are waiting for more information. We’re waiting for political news, we’re waiting for earnings. There’s a lot ofuncertainty out there. As the month goes on I expect we’ll see some movement,” said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. The financial sector fell 0.8 per cent on Monday. It had risen almost 18 per cent since the election, led by banking stocks. Big banks will provide the first peek into how US companies fared in the fourth quarter later this week. S&P 500companies overall are expected to post a 5.8 per cent increase in profit in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “There is some hope we’ll see some movement upward. Investors want to see some of those reports come out first,’’ said Jankovskis. Two-thirds of the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average components fell, keeping the psychologically significant 20,000 mark at bay. Goldman Sachs’ 0.8 per cent fall was its biggest drag followed by International Business Machine’s 0.9 per cent drop and Exxon Mobil’s 1.7 per cent decline. The Dow had come tantalisingly close to the milestone on Friday, hitting a peak of 19,999.63, as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also touched records after a late pop in tech stocks. “Our view about the Dow (hitting) 20,000 is not a matter ofif, but a matter of when,” said Matt Jones, US head of equity strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 76.42 points or 0.38 per cent at 19,887.38, the S&P 500 had lost 8.08 points or 0.354856 per cent to 2,268.9 and the Nasdaq Composite had added 10.76 points or 0.19 per cent to 5,531.82. Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower. The S&P’s health sector was the biggest gainer with Merck & Co., the leading boost, and Vertex Pharmaceuticals, the biggest percentage gainer, with a4.4 per cent jump after it issued guidance. Nasdaq’s biggest drivers in the healthcare sector were Ariad Pharmaceuticals, which closed up 72.9 per cent on a $5.20-billion buyout deal with Japan’s Takeda 4502.T Incyte with a 9.4 per cent jump after it announced advancements in its cancer drug programme with Merck. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a1.77-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favoured decliners. The S&P 500 posted 6 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 55 new highs and 16 new lows. About 6.4 billion shares changed hands on US exchanges on Monday compared with the 6.6 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based startup has about $1.3 billion in cash on hand from investors, pharmaceutical partners and government grants, according to a presentation Monday at the J.P.Morgan Chase & Co. Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. It’s privately valued at about $5 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the matter wasn’t public.
