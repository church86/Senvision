(MRK) Over Multiple Patent Infringements Merck denies the allegations Sep 19, 2016, 12:17 pm EST  |  By William White, InvestorPlace Writer     Sanofi SA (ADR) (NYSE:SNY) is suing Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) for what it claims are several instances of patent infringement. The Sanofi patent infringement lawsuit against Merck was filed on Monday in the the U.S. District Court of Delaware. The goal of the lawsuit is to keep the compay from launching its own rival version of SNY’s Lantus diabetes drug in the United States. Sanofi said that it started to take legal action after Merck submitted new drug applications to the U.S. Food & Drug Administration. It claims that as many as 10 of its patents are being infringed on by the healthcare company. A spokeswoman for MRK argues that it’s products don’t infringe on SNY’s patents. Lantus is Sanofi best-selling diabetes drug. The move to stop Merck from launching its own version of the diabetes drug comes as more insulin offerings cause its revenue to decline. SNY said it expects sales from diabetes drugs, which makes up about 20% of its revenue, to continue to decline, reports The Wall Street Journal. Sanofi isn’t likely to win its lawsuit against Merck. This is due to Lantus losing its patent protection in 2015. However, the healthcare company is likely hoping to pull in some extra revenue by delaying MRK’s drug. It did the same thing with Eli Lilly and Co (NYSE:LLY) and Boehringher Ingelheim in 2014 when the two tried to launch their own diabetes drugs in the United States. SNY stock was up 1% and MRK stock was down slightly as of Noon Monday.

The suit has been prompted by Merck's filing for approval of a biosimilar version of Lantus (insulin glargine) called MK-1293 last month, and alleges infringement of 10 patents covering the drug as well as Lilly's SoloStar pen injector device. The case looks like a re-run of Sanofi's earlier lawsuit against Eli Lilly, which was settled a year ago after Lilly agreed to pay royalties to the French pharma group in exchange for a license to certain Sanofi patents. Lilly also agreed to hold off on launching its pen injector formulation of the Basaglar product - already on the market as Abasaglar in Europe - until 15 December 2016. It was free to move ahead with the launch of a vial formulation of the biosimilar, although vials are thought to represent only around a third of total Lantus sales. Lantus made more than $7bn in sales last year but is already showing the effects of competition from biosimilars and other branded basal insulin rivals such as Novo Nordisk's Levemir (insulin detemir), with sales dropping 11%. That trend continued with another 15% decline in the first half of 2016, with the falls not fully compensated by growth for longer-acting insulin glargine follow-up Toujeo. Nevertheless, every additional month of exclusivity gained in the US market limits the decline in Lantus and allows Toujeo and Sanofi's other new products such as cholesterol-lowering therapy Praluent (alirocumab) to gain ground. Merck (known as MSD outside the US), which developed its biosimilar in partnership with Samsung Bioepis, has also filed for approval of the drug in Europe.

Angola has received around 4 million tablets for mass distribution to school children. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Angola is one of the most endemic countries for schistosomiasis worldwide. It is estimated that around 26% of the overall population requires treatment. Angola has been participating in the Merck Praziquantel Donation Program since 2008 and has received nearly 12 million tablets to date. “We want to contribute to eliminating the insidious worm disease in order to help infected children to take part in the economic development of their home countries. With our donation of approximately 4 million tablets to WHO for Angola approximately 1.6 million school children can be treated – covering half of the country’s school-aged population in need of treatment. This shows that we are on the right track. However, we know that we alone cannot solve the problem with our tablets,” said Eduardo Carvalho, General Manager of Merck in Angola. As part of its responsibility for society and within Health, one of its corporate responsibility strategic spheres of activity, Merck is supporting WHO in the fight against the worm disease schistosomiasis in Africa. Since 2007, more than 74 million patients, primarily school children, have been treated. To this end, Merck has donated over 340 million praziquantel tablets to WHO. Praziquantel is well tolerated and the most effective treatment to date for schistosomiasis. Merck is also supporting educational and awareness programs in Africa, developing schistosomiasis therapies for very young children and cooperating with partners in the Global Schistosomiasis Alliance.

These data and conclusions should be considered to be preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. Note that Merck is dropping further development of Odanacatib -- a cathepsin K inhibitor -- which had proved efficacious for fracture prevention in osteoporosis due to stroke risk. Be aware that the mechanism remains unclear, but the risk of stroke was clearly elevated among those taking odanacatib as part of the research program. ATLANTA -- Development of the investigational cathepsin K inhibitor odanacatib for the treatment of osteoporosis has been stopped by study sponsor Merck, after a safety analysis found an increased risk of stroke, researchers reported here. In the double-blind base phase of the large phase III clinical study known as LOFT, which enrolled more than 16,000 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, there were 240 strokes among patients receiving odanacatib, for a significant 32% greater risk of stroke versus placebo (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.02-1.70, P=0.03), according to Michelle O'Donoghue, MD, of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. And then, in the long-term extension phase of the trial, which enrolled more than 8,000 patients, the total number of strokes was 324, giving a hazard ratio of 1.37 (95% CI 1.10-1.71, P=0.005), which was "very significant," she said at the annual meeting of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research. There also was a trend towards an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or flutter, with a hazard ratio of 1.25 (95% CI 0.98-1.60, P=0.07) in the base phase and 1.22 (95% CI 0.99-1.50, P=0.06) during the extension phase. There had been a total of 306 atrial fibrillation or flutter events during the trial. She and her colleagues also considered whether there were subgroups of patients who were at particular risk. "We did not see any evidence on the basis of age, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack, or other risk factors for stroke such as diabetes, hypertension, or prior myocardial infarction," she said. "We observed that inhibition of cathepsin K in postmenopausal women appeared to increase the risk of stroke, and also was associated with a trend for an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or flutter. At this time, the mechanistic underpinnings to explain these findings remain unknown, but we believe warrant further investigation," O'Donoghue said. In contrast, when the study began, "preclinical data had suggested that inhibition of cathepsin K may actually interfere with or hinder atherogenesis and might promote plaque stability," she said. Beginning in 2007, the LOFT study randomized women whose T-score was -2.5 or lower at the total hip or femoral neck to 50 mg odanacatib per week or placebo. In July 2012, the data monitoring committee recommended that the study be stopped because of robust efficacy for the fracture data and a favorable benefit-risk profile, but also recommended that patients continue on treatment and that safety data collection be continued through 60 months. Following completion of the base phase of the trial, a preliminary assessment raised concerns about higher rates of some types of cardiovascular events among patients receiving odamacatib, O'Donoghue said. So the TIMI study group, an academic research organization based at Brigham and Women's Hospital, was asked to adjudicate the cardiovascular events for the LOFT program. They identified a total of 4,410 cardiovascular events and deaths and 1,100 cerebrovascular events during a mean 34.5 months of follow-up in the base period and an additional 9.7 months in the extension phase. For the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, there were 518 events during the base period, for an overall nonsignificant hazard ratio of 1.12 (95% CI 0.95-1.34, P=0.18). For all-cause mortality, there also was a nonsignificant hazard ratio of 1.13 (P=0.10). The long term efficacy data in the phase III LOFT trial were presented in a separate session at the meeting by Michael R. McClung, MD, of the Oregon Osteoporosis Center in Portland. A total of 16,071 patients had been randomized, 8,257 had entered the long term extension study, and 6,047 completed it. The study took place at 388 study sites in 40 countries. "This was a very large study," McClung pointed out. The mean age at the time of randomization was 73, and 47% had a prior vertebral fracture. Mean BMD T-scores were -2.7 at both the lumbar spine and the femoral neck. Mean follow-up was 44 months. Over the 5 years of follow-up, there were relative risk reductions of 52% for vertebral fractures, 48% for hip fractures, 26% for nonvertebral fractures, and 67% for clinical vertebral fractures (P<0.001 for all). In addition, compared with placebo, treatment with odanacatib was associated with increases in BMD of 10.9% (95% CI 10.5-11.2) at the lumbar spine and 10.3% (95% CI 10-10.6) at the total hip (P<0.001 for both). "Our results showed that odanacatib, over an interval of 5 years, significantly reduced the risk of vertebral, hip, nonvertebral, and clinical fractures. There also were substantial and progressive BMD improvements," he said. "Despite these very positive efficacy data, 2 weeks ago Merck made the announcement that because of a confirmed risk of stroke noted in the study, further development of odanacatib will not occur," McClung concluded. LOFT was sponsored by Merck. McClung disclosed financial relationships with Merck and Amgen. Reviewed by F.

Angola has received around 4 million tablets for mass distribution to school children. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Angola is one of the most endemic countries for schistosomiasis worldwide. It is estimated that around 26 percent of the overall population requires treatment. Angola has been participating in the Merck Praziquantel Donation Program since 2008 and has received nearly 12 million tablets to date. “We want to contribute to eliminating the insidious worm disease in order to help infected children to take part in the economic development of their home countries. With our donation of approximately 4 million tablets to WHO for Angola approximately 1.6 million school children can be treated – covering half of the country’s school-aged population in need of treatment. This shows that we are on the right track. However, we know that we alone cannot solve the problem with our tablets,” said Eduardo Carvalho, General Manager of Merck in Angola. As part of its responsibility for society and within Health, one of its corporate responsibility strategic spheres of activity, Merck is supporting WHO in the fight against the worm disease schistosomiasis in Africa. Since 2007, more than 74 million patients, primarily school children, have been treated. To this end, Merck has donated over 340 million praziquantel tablets to WHO. Praziquantel is well tolerated and the most effective treatment to date for schistosomiasis. Merck is also supporting educational and awareness programs in Africa, developing schistosomiasis therapies for very young children and cooperating with partners in the Global Schistosomiasis Alliance. — African Media Agency, AMA —  Sep 19, 2016 @ 14:35 GMT | No Comments Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

New York Ag News Headlines Poultry Pharmaceuticals Market to Reach $7.8 Billion by 2024 New York Ag Connection - 09/19/2016 The poultry pharmaceuticals market is dominated by Merck Animal Health and Zoetis Inc. and the two companies together accounted for over half the market in 2015. The rest of the market is, however, fragmented and is characterized by the presence of several large and small players. Transparency Market Research notes that the rivalry within the animal healthcare industry is quite high due to the existence of a large number of players and this trend is also reflected in the global poultry pharmaceutical market. "The high degree of competition ensures that poultry pharmaceutical companies maintain regular interaction and collaborations with drug retailers, governments, and poultry farmers," the author of the study states. The revenue generated by the global poultry pharmaceuticals market was pegged at US$3.7 bn in 2015 and is projected to reach US$7.8 bn by 2024, registering a healthy CAGR of 8.5% during the forecast period. Product innovation has also proven to be a successful strategy adopted by players in the poultry pharmaceutical market, TMR finds. For instance, in September 2015, Merial Animal Health globally launched its innovation in poultry vaccination technology, known as Merial Avinew. This move has strengthened Merial's position in the market. By type of product, vaccines held the leading share in the global poultry pharmaceuticals market in terms of revenue, accounting for just over 41% in 2016. Feed additive medications, on the other hand, will register an 8.8% CAGR during the forecast period, emerging as a highly lucrative product segment. Based on type of animal, chicken is the key contributor to the overall market and is likely to remain so through 2024. The segment will also register a higher growth rate than any other category. Geographically, while North America dominates the global poultry pharmaceutical market, accounting for just short of 36% in 2016, Latin America is forecast to clock in the highest CAGR of 9.2% from 2016 to 2024. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in the U.S states that the demand for food is expected to double due to the increase in global population, which is projected to be around 9.1 billion by 2050. In order to cater to this ever-rising demand for food, the number of poultry farming operations and franchises has increased significantly in recent years. China, Brazil, Mexico, India, Russia, and Argentina are among the leading countries with a high growth rate in terms of poultry animal ownership. This has benefited the poultry pharmaceutical market. Apart from this, the poultry pharmaceuticals market is fueled by the growing emphasis on wellness and preventive care by veterinarians and poultry animal owners, the rising consumption of animal protein, the increasing incidence of poultry diseases, and the support from government and private organizations in the form of vaccination initiatives. In contrast, the poultry pharmaceutical market is hampered by stringent regulations, lengthy product approval periods, and limited vaccination production. The growing concerns regarding the use of antibiotics and growth promoters in animal feed are also hindering the growth of the global market. This review is based on the findings of a TMR report titled "Poultry Pharmaceuticals Market - (By Product - Drugs, Vaccines, Feed Additive, and Medication; By Animal Type - Chicken, Turkey, Duck, Goose, and Others) - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecast 2016 - 2024."

Cattan Recovery Outreach Center. Opioid abuse is the third most common case the facility saw during the last year. The Billy T. Cattan Recovery Outreach Center is the only outpatient substance abuse facility in the Crossroads area.   Ana Ramirez for The Victoria Advocate TOP CONTRIBUTORS • Ted Cruz's biggest contributor was Pfizer, for $16,250 in 2012; however, $3,900 was returned in 2013. John Cornyn received $30,000 from Abbott Laboratories between 2007 and 2015. He also received $21,500 from the American Society of Anesthesiologists and $21,000 from the Pfizer. Lois Kolkhorst: Pfizer and Abbott Laboratories are two of her biggest contributors. She has several other smaller contributions. Blake Farenthold's biggest contributions come from American Society of Anesthesiologists with $16,500. • Geanie Morrison's contributions include Johnson & Johnson and Merck & Co. Read: Painkiller manufacturers adopt national strategy Dr. Sidney Ontai estimates about 20 percent of his patients were selling their prescription pain medication at his private practice in West Texas. Patients would come in and say whatever they needed for more pills, especially during an economic downturn. "They think it doesn't hurt anyone," he said. But the reality is that overdose deaths have spiked in communities across the country. An investigation by The Associated Press and the Center for Public Integrity discovered drugmakers that produce opioid painkillers and allied advocacy groups spent more than $880 million on campaign contributions and lobbying over the past decade as they worked to influence state and federal policies. The goal of pharmaceutical companies, the investigation shows, is to derail or weaken legislation aimed at stemming the tide of prescription opioids. The investigation comes as the number of overdose deaths from prescription painkillers has soared, claiming the lives of 165,000 people in the U.S. since 2000. Victoria's battle In the past nine months, the Victoria Fire Department has responded to 81 overdose/poisoning cases. Tracy Fox, assistant fire chief of EMS operations, said a drug called Naloxone was administered in 24 of those cases. Known by the brand name Narcan, the drug is used by first responders to counteract life-threatening depression of the central nervous system and respiratory system in an opioid overdose victim. Texas Senate Bill 1462 made Naloxone available without a prescription to anyone at pharmacies. This is one of several efforts to help curb opioid overdoses in Texas. Another effort is a state prescription drug database, which monitors controlled drugs to identify patients who may be misusing prescription opioids. Opioids are prescribed to relieve pain and include oxycodone, hydrocodone and fentanyl. "Opioid addiction has always been a pain in the butt for physicians," Ontai said. The family medicine physician moved to Victoria more than two years ago and is director of DeTar Healthcare System's physician residency program. Ontai said while opioids offer relief for a few hours, they shouldn't be a long-term option for those with moderate or chronic pain. "If I thought that, prescribing that, they'd actually get better, then I would prescribe it in a heartbeat," he said. One in four patients receiving long-term opioid therapy in a primary care setting struggles with opioid addiction, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. No inpatient help When access becomes an issue, some turn to heroin, said Daniel Barrientos, executive director of the Billy T. Cattan Recovery Outreach. He said he's seen addiction in professional people who were given an opioid prescription for an injury or dental work. But by the time his clients come to the outreach, many are uninsured and indigent and have burned bridges with family and friends. This makes treatment even more difficult. There are no inpatient facilities in the Crossroads where a patient can detox under medical supervision, Barrientos said. The staff members at the nonprofit offer outpatient counseling, and they do what they can to treat people with addiction. Mark Kelly, a licensed chemical dependency counselor, doesn't often share his personal experience, but he's overcome addiction. He was prescribed hydrocodone after an injury and used the drug for 10 years. Unlike alcoholics, those addicted to pain medication can often hide it for years. Kelly said he wants to help others through counseling because freedom from addiction can't be done alone. "This is a treatable illness," he said. "Don't be ashamed of it." Prescription opioid addictions account for at least 16 percent of the nonprofit's admissions during the past year. "This is something right at our door, and it's a major public health concern," Kelly said. According to the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps website, drug overdose deaths happen in Victoria County almost as frequently as motor vehicle crash deaths, which is about 14 deaths per 100,000 people. The CDC estimates the majority of drug overdose deaths - more than six out of 10 - involve an opioid. Unpopular alternatives Health experts agree that another approach is needed to help the 100 million Americans suffering from chronic pain. Part of the solution will be moving toward alternative therapies for pain such as physical therapy, acupuncture, chiropractic care, massage, yoga or even antidepressants. Ontai said physicians face challenges when they suggest non-drug options. He said, for example, when he talks to a patient who has had pain for 20 years and is unable to work, they often want a quick fix. Alternative therapies are often the road less traveled, he said. "You have to do all this work," Ontai said. "If you power through all of the pain, your body actually does heal."

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) FILE - This July 16, 2013, file photo, shows a Wall Street street sign outside the New York Stock Exchange. Global stock markets started the new trading week strongly Monday, Sept. 19, 2016, as investors appeared to put last week's jitters behind them as they awaited the outcome of the latest policy meetings of the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan later this week. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York • U.S. stocks wobbled and finished mostly lower Monday as investors waited for central bank meetings in the United States and Japan. Health care and technology companies took some of the biggest losses while banks rose. Investors were indecisive as leaders of the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan prepared to meet, and stocks swung several times between gains and losses. The Dow rose as much as 131 points early on, then fell as much as 30 points in the afternoon. Banks, utility companies and machinery makers rose. Bond yields edged higher and the dollar weakened. Russ Koesterich, head of asset allocation with BlackRock's Global Allocation Fund, said investors don't expect the Fed to raise interest rates. However he said investors have more questions about the Bank of Japan's plans. VIDEOS TOP JOBS "They could decide to introduce more stimulus, but it could take a lot of different forms," he said. "One of the questions ... is not only what will they do, but what would the market like to see?" While advancing stocks far outnumbered decliners, the Dow Jones industrial average dipped 3.63 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 18,120.17. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 0.04 points to 2,139.12. The Nasdaq composite fell 9.54 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,235.03. The Federal Reserve will meet Tuesday and announce its latest decision on interest rates the following day. Banks got a boost as some investors hoped that interest rates will rise, which would allow banks to make more money from lending. JPMorgan Chase rose 37 cents to $66.19 and Wells Fargo regained 58 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $46.01. Technology products distributor Tech Data jumped after it said it will buy the technology solutions business of Avnet for $2.6 billion in cash and stock. Tech Data says the deal will give it operations in 35 countries. Its stock rose $15.46, or 22.3 percent, to $84.80 and Avnet gained $2.68, or 6.8 percent, to $41.89. Meanwhile, network control company Infoblox agreed to be bought by Vista Equity Partners for $26.50 per share, or $1.51 billion. It surged $3.52, or 15.4 percent, to $26.35. Despite those gains, the broader technology sector gave up an early advance and finished mostly lower. Apple, which surged last week and reached its highest price this year, lost $1.34, or 1.2 percent, to $113.58 and Intel fell 51 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $37.16. Health care stocks also lagged the market. Merck fell 95 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $61.33 after rival Sanofi said it sued company. Sanofi says Merck infringed on patents protecting its insulin drug Lantus. Eye drug maker Regeneron Pharmaceuticals fell $5.80, or 1.4 percent, to $402.83. Sarepta Therapeutics soared $20.79, or 73.9 percent, to $48.94 after the Food and Drug Administration granted tentative approval to its drug Exondys 51, a treatment for a type of muscular dystrophy. The drug treats Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a rare and deadly inherited disease that causes muscle weakness and eventually the loss of all basic movement. It usually causes death by age 25. The FDA had hesitated to approve the drug because advisers said there was little evidence it worked. Its approval is based on a study of only 12 patients, and the FDA is ordering Sarepta to run a larger study. Isle of Capri Casinos agreed to be bought by Eldorado Resorts for $23 per share, or $950 million in cash and stock. Combined, the companies own 21 casinos and race tracks. Isle of Capri stock jumped $5.11, or 30.2 percent, to $22.04 while Eldorado Resorts stock lost 41 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $13.84. Health website operator WebMD slumped after it said CEO David Schlanger is leaving the company by mutual agreement. Schlanger is being replaced by President Steven Zatz, who is in charge of WebMD's advertising and sponsorship business. WebMD fell $2.95, or 5.7 percent, to $49.02 and it is down 27 percent since May 25. General Motors gained 75 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $31.72 after an analyst said auto sales, which are at record highs, should remain strong for several years. Analyst Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley raised his rating on GM to "Overweight" and raised his price target to $37 a share from $29. » Next page...

Big pharma spends millions to keep prices high for California agencies The Street 9/13/2016 Alicia McElhaney Click to expand Replay Video Ford moving smaller car production to Mexico The Ford Motor Company is moving ahead with plans to shift production of small cars to Mexico from Michigan. Ford CEO Mark Fields says they will move their production of the Ford Focus to Mexico to create room for "two very important products" coming to the Michigan factories. Fields states that this will not affect on jobs in Michigan what so ever. President-elect Donald Trump has criticized Ford for the decision to shift production to Mexico, and said he would consider levying tariffs on Mexican-made Fords.

Quotes in the article Merck KGaA 0O14 ▲ 94.23 +1.44 +1.55% Pfizer Inc PFZ ▲ 32.27 +0.06 +0.19% Johnson & Johnson JNJ ▲ 116.40 +0.08 +0.07% Amgen Inc AMGN ▲ 147.71 +0.65 +0.44% Proposition 61 is a proposal Californians will vote on in this November's election that requires state agencies to pay the same prices the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs pays for medication - approximately 50% less than list prices. The federal department already pays less for most prescription drugs, so the bill will likely be a boon to patients in the state. As a result, Proposal 61 has received overwhelming support from citizens and visible politicians like former Democratic presidential candidate and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, but not so much love from large drug companies. If the bill passes into law, drug manufacturers don't have to offer savings to the state. According to analyst David Larsen of healthcare-focused investment bank Leerink, the major drug companies could choose to extend the prices they offer to the Department of Veterans Affairs to the state, while offsetting the discounts by raising the prices of other drugs. "If drug manufacturers chose to extend [Veterans Affairs'] pricing to California, the state might realize savings but this could be partially offset by prices raised on drugs not purchased by the VA," Larsen wrote. "Additionally, drug companies could risk a domino effect of having to discount other states." This, though, is unlikely, as companies are not required by law to extend the prices. Instead, the state must pay those same prices, and if they can't, they can no longer offer to pay for the drug under insurance plans. Drug manufacturers could also decline to offer the Veterans Affairs prices to California agencies, which Larsen said is most likely. As a result, fewer drugs will be offered under state funded insurance programs. Finally, manufacturers could raise the prices they offer to the VA, which was threatened in 1992 when Congress considered doing something similar on a federal level. While drug companies stand to benefit politically from opposing this bill, they likely won't see an impact on their bottom lines if Proposition 61 passes - at least at first. "In our opinion, due to the fact that Prop 61 addresses such a narrow portion of the California population - state agencies and non MCO Medi-Cal, the revenue and earnings exposure for the distributors and PBMs is minimal," Larsen wrote. He added that down the line, it is likely that California's legislature will realize that companies can raise prices elsewhere, and will ultimately repeal the ballot measure. Merck, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson each contributed over $7 million to efforts opposing the proposition, while Amgen , Abbvie and Sanofi contributed over $5 million, according to the California Fair Political Practices Commission. In total, those opposing the bill have spent $70 million, seven times the amount those supporting the bill have spent. These numbers may seem small in comparison to each company's market cap, but it is important to note that this bill would only affect a sliver of the state's population--those using Medicare, Medicaid and other state-run healthcare programs. Still, it could encourage other states to attempt to pass similar bills, especially in the wake of recent drug pricing scandals, like Mylan's MYL decision to boost EpiPen prices 25% each year, resulting in a $600 pricetag for some patients.

While few expect Federal Open Market Committee to announce a rate hike this week, most bet they will do so later this calendar year. “Fears about the Fed increase and then dissipate, and all you can do is try to follow that news flow,” lan Higgins, chief investment officer at Coutts & Co in London, told Bloomberg. “The Fed is very aware of what the market is looking for and hopefully we’ll get no policy shock.” In 3.10pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index inched 0.01 percent higher. In 2.55pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.3 percent. "The market has been all over the place. It’s been driven by the threat of higher interest rates," Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, told Reuters. "Most people feel the most unloved bull market in recent memory will be cut off at the knees by higher interest rates and the Fed is certainly threatening that in the near term.” The Dow moved higher as advances in shares of 3M and those of Boeing, recently trading 1.2 percent and 1.1 higher respectively, outweighed slides in shares of Merck and those of Intel, down 1.3 percent and 1 percent respectively. Some are keen for the Fed to move now. "Let's get on with it already," Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, told Reuters. "It will cause some challenges to the market but I think that is healthy in context of a normal business cycle. It will increase the cost of capital, and flush out some riskier assets in the short term. But that is probably the right thing to do." Meanwhile, a report showed that a gauge of US home builder sentiment in September climbed to the highest level in almost a year, according to the National Association of Home Builders and Wells Fargo. “As household incomes rise, builders in many markets across the nation are reporting they are seeing more serious buyers, a positive sign that the housing market continues to move forward,” NAHB Chairman Ed Brady, a home builder and developer from Bloomington, Illinois, said in a statement. “The single-family market continues to make gradual gains and we expect this upward momentum will build throughout the remainder of the year and into 2017.” In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a gain of 1 percent from the previous close. Germany’s DAX index rose 1 percent, France’s CAC 40 index climbed 1.4 percent, while the UK’s FTSE 100 Index increased 1.5 percent.

Early gains were fueled by rising commodity prices, especially by the rebound in crude oil prices. Crude oil prices rose back above $43 a barrel after Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said on Sunday that a deal between OPEC and non-OPEC countries to stabilize oil markets could be announced this month. The upward move was tempered by the overall attitude of caution among investors ahead of the Bank of Japan and Federal Reserve announcements on Wednesday. Investors are speculating that the Bank of Japan will probably cut its rates on some bank reserves further below zero. However, recent soft economic data has led most analysts to predict that the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged, but the central bank could still surprise the markets. U.K. financial institutions stand to lose their "passporting" rights, which allows them to operate free across Europe, if the country opts for a radical exit from the EU, European Central Bank policymaker and Bundesbank Chief Jens Weidmann said. In a joint interview given to several European newspapers, including the British daily Guardian and the German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung, and published Monday, Weidmann said, "Passporting rights are tied to the single market and would automatically cease to apply if Great Britain is no longer at least part of the European Economic Area(EEA)." Passporting rights are crucial for British financial institutions, many of whom operate from London and provide services across the EU. These rights eliminate the need for individual licenses to operate in different European countries. The "hard" Brexit route touted by some Conservatives aims to sever all trading ties with the EU and end free movement between the country and the remaining 27 members. Losing passporting rights could deal a severe blow to London's status as a financial services hub and many institutions would consider relocating their headquarters, Weidmann said. The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index advanced 1.03 percent. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone blue chip stocks increased 1.13 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major U.K. companies, added 1.04 percent. The DAX of Germany climbed 0.95 percent and the CAC 40 of France rose 1.43 percent. The FTSE 100 of the U.K. gained 1.54 percent and the SMI of Switzerland finished higher by 0.80 percent. In Frankfurt, Deutsche Bank dropped 2.38 percent to extend Friday's losses on concerns over its fragile finances. ThyssenKrupp increased 2.66 percent and Salzgitter added 3.30 percent. In Paris, food services and facilities management group Sodexo rose 2.45 percent after an upgrade by analysts at Raymond James Financial Inc. Sanofi advanced 0.90 percent. The pharmaceutical giant has filed a patent infringement suit against Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp in the United States alleging infringement of ten patents. In London, Rolls Royce Holdings advanced 1.73 percent on reports that it is reducing more than 200 positions from its middle management. Weir Group gained 1.72 percent after analysts at JP Morgan upgraded their rating on the stock to 'Overweight.' Glencore jumped 6.22 percent, after Credit Suisse upgraded its rating on the miner to "Outperform" from "Neutral." Anglo American leaped 5.71 percent and Fresnillo advanced 3.34 percent. BHP Billiton gained 3.69 percent and Rio Tinto added 3.49 percent. Randgold Resources also increased 2.24 percent. Wm Morrison Supermarkets finished up by 1.61 percent after Deutsche Bank upgraded its rating on the stock to "Hold" from "Sell." Sky increased 2.26 percent after Morgan Stanley raised its rating on the stock to "Overweight" from "Equalweight." Outsourcing firm Mitie Group sank 28.88 percent after a profit warning. Novartis gained 1.35 percent in Zurich after the pharmaceutical firm released an analysis related to its heart failure drug Entresto. Eurozone construction output growth improved strongly in July, marking a second month of growth after a three months of decline, preliminary data from Eurostat showed Monday. Construction output increased a calendar-adjusted 3.1 percent year-on-year following 0.6 percent growth in June. The latest gain was the strongest since February, when output rose 3.6 percent. The euro area current account surplus declined notably in July from a month ago, the European Central Bank reported Monday. The seasonally and working-day-adjusted current account surplus fell to EUR 21.0 billion in July from EUR 29.5 billion in June, which was revised down from EUR 28.2 billion surplus reported earlier. The average asking price for a house in the United Kingdom was up 0.7 percent on month in September, property tracking website Rightmove said on Monday - coming in at 306,499 pounds. That follows the 1.2 percent contraction in August. With homebuilders seeing more serious buyers amid rising household incomes, the National Association of Home Builders released a report on Monday showing a jump in U.S. homebuilder confidence in the month of September. The report said the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index surged up to 65 in September from a downwardly revised 59 in August. Economists had expected the index to come in unchanged compared to the 60 originally reported for the previous month. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Market Analysis Top Ten Corporate Comeback Stories The Most Influential Books In Business Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 European Market news European Markets Pull Back As Investors Take Profits European Shares Ease After Two Days Of Gains FTSE 100 Slips Into Red As Jobless Benefit Claims Rise CAC 40 Marginally Higher In Lackluster Trade DAX Subdued In Early Trade; Bayer Shares Down 5% European Shares Seen Extending Gains European Markets Finish Mostly Higher, But Little Changed Overall European Shares Cling To Gains After Data Deluge FTSE 100 Breaches 6800 As Pound Extends Slide CAC 40 Extends Gains As Oil Rallies DAX Gives Up Early Gains European Shares Seen Higher On Trump Stimulus Hopes European Markets Pare Early Gains After Crude Oil Prices Turn Lower European Shares Rally As Investors Ponder Trump's Policies FTSE 100 Rallies As Pound Drifts Lower <<Previous        35 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Sanders Joins Democratic Leadership But Remains An Independent Poll Shows Most Americans Want Trump To Compromise Comeback Kid: Donald Trump Hugely Resilient In Business, Too Senate Democrats Elect Chuck Schumer As New Minority Leader Major Averages Stuck On Opposite Sides Of Unchanged Line - U.S. Commentary U.S. Homebuilder Confidence Holds Steady In November Trump Denies Transition Disarray, Says Organized Process Taking Place U.S. Industrial Production Unexpectedly Comes In Flat In October U.S. Producer Prices Unexpectedly Hold Steady In October Paul Ryan Unanimously Re-nominated As House Speaker Target Lifts Q4, FY16 Forecast As Q3 Results Top Estimates Snapchat Parent Confidentially Initiates IPO Process Wall Street Points To Lower Opening Wall Street Set To Open Mixed Rally May Stall For China Stock Market Wall Street Poised For Lower Opening Stocks Close Mostly Higher Following Upbeat Retail Sales Data - U.S. Commentary Wall Street Aims At Higher Opening European Shares Seen Higher On Trump Stimulus Hopes European Shares Rally As Investors Ponder Trump's Policies Stocks Close Mixed On The Day But Sharply Higher For The Week - U.S. Commentary Asian Markets Mostly Higher Amid Cautious Trades Canadian Stocks Are Sinking As Commodity Prices Drop -- Canadian Commentary Stocks Turning In Lackluster Performance In Morning Trading - U.S. Commentary European Shares Seen Flat To Slightly Lower Asian Shares Mostly Lower On Surging Bond Yields DAX Off Day's High; Allianz Shares Up 3% CAC 40 Gives Up Early Gains FTSE 100 Slips Into Red After Positive Start European Shares Mostly Lower As Trump Rally Falters Sensex Slumps 700 Points On Capital Outflow Fears; Nifty Ends Below 8,300 Wall Street Points To Lower Opening Dow May Pull Back Off Record Highs In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary Canadian Stocks Set For Weak Open -- Canadian Commentary Profit Taking May Lead To Early Weakness On Wall Street Stocks Turning In Lackluster Performance In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary Copyright © 2016 RTTNews.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 12:35 AM, September 20, 2016 Updated: 8:05 AM, September 20, 2016 NEW YORK - British Prime Minister Theresa May met business chiefs from firms including Goldman Sachs <GS.N>, IBM <IBM.N> and Amazon.com <AMZN.O> on Monday in an attempt to reassure investors after her country's shock vote to leave the European Union. The June 23 vote took many investors and chief executives by surprise, triggering the deepest political and financial turmoil in Britain since World War Two and the biggest ever one-day fall in sterling against the dollar. "Every working day in the United Kingdom one million people wake up and go to work for an American company. And every day in the United States one million people wake up and go to work for a UK company," May told the business leaders. "So you see there is reciprocity," said May, who is in New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly. "The UK is going to be out there. We will be looking ‎for business. And ladies and gentlemen, please feel free to invest in the UK." May said that she wanted to hear what issues business leaders wanted addressed in the Brexit negotiations, which she said would yield a good deal in the trade of goods and services with the EU. Chief executives from AECOM <ACM.N>, Morgan Stanley <MS.N>, BlackRock <BLK.N>, Merck & Co <MRK.N>, Sony Pictures and United Technologies Corp <UTX.N> also attended the meeting. The head of Thomson Reuters <TRI.TO>, the parent company of Reuters News, also attended. May first had a closed meeting with major investors and Wall Street banks before addressing dozens of other executives at a wider reception. Despite warnings before the vote that Brexit would shatter economic confidence, some positive economic data and SoftBank's $32 billion takeover of Britain's technology company ARM have stoked the perception that Britain could prosper outside the EU. Still, May and her ministers admit they need to reassure investors from the United States, Japan, China and India that the United Kingdom and London, the only financial capital to rival New York, are still good places to make money. The United States is the largest single inward investor into Britain, which currently attracts far more foreign direct investment than any other EU member. When asked what they wanted to hear from May, one business leader at the meeting who asked not to be named said: "Reassurance." "BREXIT MEANS BREXIT" Some investors have called for clarity about how much access foreign companies based or operating out of Britain will have to the European market, a concern for some U.S. banks and manufacturers which sell into the EU from Britain. Other issues include when and how Brexit will happen. May, who has repeatedly pledged that "Brexit means Brexit", has so far said only that she will not trigger the formal EU divorce process before the end of this year. "‎We will be getting the right deal for the United Kingdom and that is the right deal in terms of trade in goods and services because we recognize the importance of both," May said. "At the same time we want to scope out new deals around the world to further liberalize trade between the UK and other partners around the world," she added. U.S. President Barack Obama said this month that he wanted the Brexit process to be resolved in the least disruptive way possible, though both France and Germany face elections next year which could complicate the Brexit negotiations. Before the vote, some U.S. companies had warned that Brexit would complicate their lives and could cost jobs. Those included JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, who has 16,000 staff based in Britain. British companies reduced their investment plans in the month after Britain voted to leave the EU, a survey by Lloyds Bank showed on Monday, a further sign the decision is likely to have a lasting impact on the economy. Last month, the Bank of England left its forecast for British growth this year steady at 2.0 percent but cautioned that there might be little growth in the second half and sharply downgraded its forecast for 2017 to just 0.8 percent from a previous estimate of 2.3 percent. "What I really wanted to talk to you about tonight is just very simply to say this: Britain is open for business," May said.

Chief executives from AECOM <ACM.N>, Morgan Stanley <MS.N>, BlackRock <BLK.N>, Merck & Co <MRK.N>, Sony Pictures and United Technologies Corp <UTX.N> also attended the meeting. The head of Thomson Reuters <TRI.TO>, the parent company of Reuters News, also attended. May first had a closed meeting with major investors and Wall Street banks before addressing dozens of other executives at a wider reception. Despite warnings before the vote that Brexit would shatter economic confidence, some positive economic data and SoftBank's $32 billion takeover of Britain's technology company ARM have stoked the perception that Britain could prosper outside the EU. Still, May and her ministers admit they need to reassure investors from the United States, Japan, China and India that the United Kingdom and London, the only financial capital to rival New York, are still good places to make money. The United States is the largest single inward investor into Britain, which currently attracts far more foreign direct investment than any other EU member. When asked what they wanted to hear from May, one business leader at the meeting who asked not to be named said: "Reassurance." "BREXIT MEANS BREXIT" Some investors have called for clarity about how much access foreign companies based or operating out of Britain will have to the European market, a concern for some U.S. banks and manufacturers which sell into the EU from Britain. Other issues include when and how Brexit will happen. May, who has repeatedly pledged that "Brexit means Brexit", has so far said only that she will not trigger the formal EU divorce process before the end of this year. "‎We will be getting the right deal for the United Kingdom and that is the right deal in terms of trade in goods and services because we recognize the importance of both," May said. "At the same time we want to scope out new deals around the world to further liberalize trade between the UK and other partners around the world," she added. U.S. President Barack Obama said this month that he wanted the Brexit process to be resolved in the least disruptive way possible, though both France and Germany face elections next year which could complicate the Brexit negotiations. Before the vote, some U.S. companies had warned that Brexit would complicate their lives and could cost jobs. Those included JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, who has 16,000 staff based in Britain. British companies reduced their investment plans in the month after Britain voted to leave the EU, a survey by Lloyds Bank showed on Monday, a further sign the decision is likely to have a lasting impact on the economy. Last month, the Bank of England left its forecast for British growth this year steady at 2.0 percent but cautioned that there might be little growth in the second half and sharply downgraded its forecast for 2017 to just 0.8 percent from a previous estimate of 2.3 percent. "What I really wanted to talk to you about tonight is just very simply to say this: Britain is open for business," May said.

REUTERS/Toby Melville By Guy Faulconbridge | NEW YORK NEW YORK British Prime Minister Theresa May met business chiefs from firms including Goldman Sachs (GS.N), IBM (IBM.N) and Amazon.com (AMZN.O) on Monday in an attempt to reassure investors after her country's shock vote to leave the European Union. The June 23 vote took many investors and chief executives by surprise, triggering the deepest political and financial turmoil in Britain since World War Two and the biggest ever one-day fall in sterling against the dollar. "Every working day in the United Kingdom one million people wake up and go to work for an American company. And every day in the United States one million people wake up and go to work for a UK company," May told the business leaders. "So you see there is reciprocity," said May, who is in New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly. "The UK is going to be out there. We will be looking ‎for business. And ladies and gentlemen, please feel free to invest in the UK." May said that she wanted to hear what issues business leaders wanted addressed in the Brexit negotiations, which she said would yield a good deal in the trade of goods and services with the EU. Chief executives from AECOM (ACM.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N), BlackRock (BLK.N), Merck & Co (MRK.N), Sony Pictures and United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) also attended the meeting.

While most economists expect a status quo in Fed review, the Bank of Japan may consider expanding its monetary stimulus at the Sept. 20-21 meeting. Benchmark U.S. crude futures jumped about 2 percent during European hours on talk of an OPEC deal to limit output and reports of fighting at Libyan oil ports.

MUMBAI: A United Nations panel has recommended that punitive measures be taken against countries that use political and commercial pressure to undermine use of international trade agreements. In a report on access to drugs, the high-level panel has strongly urged the use of flexibility under Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) which provide for leeway to middle and low-income countries when it comes to imposing intellectual property rights, especially when it comes to medicines. "WTO members must make full use of TRIPS flexibilities as reaffirmed by the Doha Declaration to promote access to health technologies when necessary. In particular they must ensure patents are only awarded when genuine innovation has occurred and enable the expedient use of compulsory licensing to increase access to health technologies," the report said. The committee has asked governments to refrain from explicit or implicit threats, tactics or strategies that undermine the right of WTO members to use flexibility under TRIPS. "Instances of undue political and commercial pressure should be formally reported to the WTO Secretariat during the trade policy review of members. WTO members must register complaints against undue political and economic pressure, and take punitive measures against offending members," it said. The report cites the example of Thailand and Colombia, where political and commercial pressure was used to dissuade them from using the provisions of compulsory licensing, a WTO option that allows countries to grant licences to generic makers for patented drugs in times of emergency. In 2006 Thailand decided to import generic versions of Merck's antiretroviral drug from India, under compulsory licensing, which led the US and European government criticising the use of the provision. Colombia, this year, issued compulsory licensing for the anticancer drug imatinib, a move that the country said was criticised by several domestic and foreign parties. The recommendations come as a relief for India, which has come under severe pressure from the United States for its decision to issue compulsory licensing for German drug maker Bayer's kidney cancer drug Sorafenib a couple of years ago. This had led to trade tensions between India and the US. Since then, experts said, India has been cautious with matters pertaining to intellectual property rights. The report has, however, angered the big pharma that has accused the UN of "driving a narrow and extreme agenda". The Global Intellectual Property Centre of the US Chamber of Commerce said the report ignores decades of data that proves that intellectual property rights do not curtail access to drugs. The centre said the panel has ignored the real culprits that stand between patients and care - excessive tariffs and taxes on imported medicines, and weak healthcare infrastructures that hinder the effective distribution of medicines. "The irony is that by singling out patents, this report has attacked the innovative systems that have actually produced thousands of cures and saved millions of lives. Decades of research have shown that the private sector is responsible for as much as 97 percent of drug development. If adopted, these recommendations could prohibit the creation of future breakthrough treatments," the GIPC said. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

Opioid lobby spends big on Tennessee politics Mike Reicher , mreicher@tennessean.com 2:01 p.m. CDT September 20, 2016 Since 2006, Tennessee legislators have introduced at least 41 bills that dealt with opioids, about half of which passed. (Photo: Getty Images / Ingram Publishing) Tennessee politicians received more than $1.6 million in campaign contributions over the past decade from pharmaceutical companies and other members of the Pain Care Forum, a coalition that meets monthly to discuss opioid-related issues. An investigation by The Associated Press and the Center for Public Integrity examined the industry’s influence at statehouses around the nation. About $560,000 went to Tennessee state candidates and state political parties, and more than $1 million went to those running for federal office. Since 2006, Tennessee legislators have introduced at least 41 bills that dealt with opioids, about half of which passed. Here are the top five current Tennessee lawmakers who received the industry money from 2006 through 2015, according to a Tennessean analysis of data from the National Institute on Money in State Politics, the Center for Responsive Politics and the Federal Election Commission. THE TENNESSEAN Drugmakers fought state opioid limits amid crisis Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey, R- Blountville: $24,025 Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey  (Photo: Submitted) The outgoing lieutenant governor, Ramsey was seen as one of the most influential figures in state government whose support or opposition could easily determine the fate of bills. As speaker of the Senate since 2007, though, he could not introduce his own legislation. The pharma money, he said, was “a drop in the bucket” in his campaign coffers. And its influence on his votes? “None whatsoever.” Rep. Charles Sargent, Jr., R-Franklin: $16,425 Rep. Charles Sargent  (Photo: TN.gov) In 2010, Sargent sponsored a bill that authorized physicians to refer workers' compensation patients for “pain management” treatment and limited their treatment to one year. An amendment extended the time to two years. Sargent said his contributions didn’t play a role: “I couldn’t even tell you who makes the opioid drugs.” House Speaker Beth Harwell, R-Nashville: $10,000 House Speaker Beth Harwell  (Photo: Submitted) As speaker of the House of Representatives since 2011, Harwell doesn’t introduce her own bills, but her stance on legislation can prove pivotal. “I have a very strong record,” she said on combating the opioid addiction epidemic. Sen. Jack Johnson, R-Franklin: $9,925 Buy Photo Sen. Jack Johnson  (Photo: File / The Tennessean) In 2012 Johnson sponsored a bill that enabled physicians to prescribe pain medication to workers' compensation patients who experienced pain beyond the expected treatment time. “We take money from a lot of different people,” said Johnson, chairman of the powerful Commerce and Labor Committee. “I don’t keep track of it.” He added that he’s opposed some bills pushed by the drug industry. Sen. Randy McNally, R-Oak Ridge: $9,900 Buy Photo Sen. Randy McNally  (Photo: Jed DeKalb / File / The Tennessean) McNally has sponsored four opioid-related bills since 2006, two of which passed. The most recent required that all pain management clinics be licensed. In 2011 he introduced legislation that would have required insurers to cover “tamper-resistant” opioids. While that bill failed, it could have boosted drug company profits because most tamper-resistant opioids have no generic equivalent. Evidence, too, is mixed on whether those formulations actually prevent abuse. “You balance out the good effects against the bad,” he said. “Overall, we thought it was good.” Top 5 big pharma players in Tenn. politics While most opioids are made by large generics makers, some U.S. drug companies market opioids — and are active in state politics. Here are the top five contributors in Tennessee that also are members of the Pain Care Forum, an opioid advocacy group. To be sure, pharmaceutical companies donate to political campaigns and employ lobbyists for a range of legislative issues, including opioids. These totals include contributions to Tennessee candidates and state parties from 2006 to 2015. Pfizer, $227,150: The company promotes Embeda, which Pfizer acquired when it bought King Pharmaceuticals in 2011. Pfizer also is seeking FDA approval for a long-acting drug with abuse-resistant properties called Troxyca ER. Merck & Co., $102,900: Merck is not known for any major opioid-based drugs, but it's an active player behind the scenes on medical-related legislative issues. Abbott Laboratories, $97,025: The long-time maker of Vicodin, the widespread drug used to treat extreme pain. It’s a mixture of the opioid hydrocodone and the primary ingredient in Tylenol. Abbott spun off its pharmaceutical wing into an independent company called AbbVie in January 2013. King Pharmaceuticals, $73,500: Known primarily for its tamper-resistant formulations of opioids, Bristol, Tenn.-based King was acquired by Pfizer in 2011. Johnson & Johnson, $25,425: In 2015, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, announced that it sold the U.S. rights to license opioid-based Nucynta for $1.05 billion.

Pharmaceutical companies and allied groups belonging to the Pain Care Forum lobbying collective gave nearly $2.5 million to federal candidates from Ohio from 2006 through 2015, according to data analyzed by The Associated Press and the Center for Public Integrity. State-level giving of more than $1 million was directed at candidates of both parties, including governors, attorneys general, Ohio Supreme Court justices and legislative leaders, and committee chairs in power positions over Ohio health law. Republican Party committees received about $137,000, while Democratic ones got $41,000. A huge chunk of the Ohio campaign cash identified through the analysis went to former U.S. House Speaker John Boehner, of southwest Ohio, who received about $875,000 over the decade, according to the data. Boehner was speaker for about half the period reviewed, from 2011 to 2015. The investigation by AP and CPI found that the Pain Care Forum worked in Washington over the past decade to quietly derail efforts to curb U.S. consumption of pain-killing drugs, such as OxyContin, by promoting the vital role of prescription painkillers in Americans’ lives. That went hand in hand with a 50-state strategy. Participating drug companies, associations and alliances also have other business before Ohio’s Legislature, but a steady flow of contributions from forum participants – who employed, on average, 37 lobbyists a year in the state – has meant their interests remain well represented when pain care issues arise. Among state candidates, Republican Gov. John Kasich topped the list, with about $46,000. Top state givers among forum members were Pfizer, Abbott Labs, Merck and Johnson & Johnson. Abbott spun off its U.S. pharmaceutical operation in 2013 and no longer lobbies on related issues. Kasich has championed a host of remedies to Ohio’s opioid problem, including creation of the Governor’s Cabinet Opiate Action Team within days of his 2011 inauguration. He has worked with state leaders since then to extend access to treatments and increase availability of the overdose drug naloxone and launched an education campaign for schoolchildren called Start Talking, among other initiatives. In the wake of those efforts, data from the analysis shows, painkiller prescriptions in Ohio have fallen from 11,261,528 in 2013 to 9,955,858 last year.
