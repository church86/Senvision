College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Top Animal-Health Companies to Buy in 2017 Looking for top animal-health companies to buy? Check out Zoetis, Merck, and Lilly. Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) May 21, 2017 at 3:02PM Animal health is probably a bigger business than you think. The global market for animal health was around $34.5 billion in 2015. By 2025, it's expected to grow to more than $58 billion.  With this rapidly growing market, there are plenty of opportunities for investors. Zoetis (NYSE:ZTS), Merck (NYSE:MRK), and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) stand out as the top animal-health companies to buy in 2017. Here's why. Image source: Getty Images. Zoetis Zoetis ranks as the world's No. 1 animal-health company, with 2016 revenue of nearly $4.9 billion. The company's products include anti-infectives, vaccines, parasiticides, medicated feed additives, and other pharmaceuticals. Zoetis focuses on improving health for livestock (including cattle, swine, poultry, sheep, and fish) and companion animals (dogs, cats, and horses). Although Zoetis' sales have increased only 7% since being spun off from Pfizer in 2013, its stock price has nearly doubled. That's partly because the company's earnings have increased by nearly 63% during the period. Just as important, though, is that analysts project continued annual earnings growth in double-digit percentages for the future. While the economy doesn't appear to be in danger right now of slipping into a recession, Zoetis could be a good pick for weathering a downturn when it comes. Sales didn't slip much during the major recession of 2008 and 2009, probably because people still care for their pets and livestock regardless of what happens in the larger economy.  Zoetis' stock trades at more than 22 times expected earnings, which is a little pricey. The company pays a dividend, but its yield is a relatively low 0.7%. However, if you're looking for a pure-play investment in animal health, there's probably no better choice than Zoetis. Most other animal-health businesses are units within a large pharmaceutical companies. Merck One of those animal-health businesses within a large drugmaker is Merck. While Merck reported total revenue in 2016 of $39.8 billion, only $3.5 billion stemmed from its animal health segment. That was enough, though, for the company to rank as the second-largest animal-health business in terms of sales. Merck's animal-health unit focuses on development and marketing of livestock, poultry, companion-animal, and aquaculture products. These products include antibiotics, vaccines, fertility medications, anti-inflammatory drugs, diabetes drugs for cats and dogs, and parasiticides. One animal-health product especially helped Merck in the first quarter of 2017. Demand grew for its Bravecto line of products for killing fleas and ticks in dogs and cats. This helped Merck's animal-health business to post year-over-year growth of 13% during the quarter and come in second after diabetes drug Januvia in contribution to total revenue. Although the company's animal-health business hasn't grown sales as impressively in recent years, Merck could be attractive to investors because of its core pharmaceuticals business. Cancer drug Keytruda is expected to drive sales higher in the coming years. In addition, Merck's dividend yield of 2.95% is a plus for long-term investors.  Eli Lilly Eli Lilly posted revenue of $21.2 billion last year. Its animal-health business accounted for nearly $3.2 billion of that total, making Lilly's Elanco division the world's No. 3 animal-health company in 2016. Like Zoetis and Merck, Lilly makes products for livestock and companion animals. Its products include cattle-feed additives, anticoccidial agents for poultry, leanness and performance enhancers for cattle and swine, antibiotics, and parasiticides. Lilly will no doubt see higher revenue from its animal-health business this year. That's because the company acquired Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc.'s U.S. feline, canine, and rabies vaccines portfolio in January. This purchase further diversified Lilly's animal product lineup. The company's Elanco animal-health business should continue to be vitally important to Lilly as it faces increased competition for products that have lost or will soon lose patent exclusivity. Cash flow generated by Elanco will also be key to Lilly continuing to pay its dividend, which currently yields 2.63%.  Keith Speights owns shares of Pfizer.

Monday, May 22, 2017 Search Archive Chinese Chinese Japanese French Spanish Russian Arabic Korea German Portuguese HomeOpinionsBusinessMilitaryWorldSocietyCultureTravelScienceSportsSpecial CoveragePhotoVideo English>> Vaccine for HPV wins approval By ZHAO XINYING (China Daily)    10:23, May 22, 2017 (File photo) Gardasil is the second such drug to gain access to patients across China Pharmaceutical company Merck recently won approval from the China Food and Drug Administration to sell its human papillomavirus vaccine, Gardasil, to help women fight cervical cancer. Developed by the US-based company in 2006, the vaccine has proved effective in protecting against the virus, better known as HPV, the chief cause of cervical cancer. The virus is found in almost all cervical cancer cases. Gardasil is the first HPV vaccine in the world and the second to be licensed for use in China. In July, Cervarix, an HPV vaccine developed by pharmaceutical GlaxoSmithKline, received approval to be sold on the Chinese mainland after almost 10 years of seeking approval. Gardasil is expected to be commercially available on the mainland in three to six months, which means women will no longer have to seek vaccinations outside of the mainland, such as Hong Kong. After breast cancer, cervical cancer is the second-most common cancer in women ages 15 to 44 in China. Statistics from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention show China reports more than 130,000 cervical cancer cases a year, accounting for 28 percent of global total. The HPV vaccine, as the first anti-cancer vaccine in the world, has proved effective in preventing cervical cancer and is seen as a breakthrough in the fight against cancer. Gardasil offers protection against nine strains of HPV, including the two main cancer-causing varieties: type 16 and type 18. Cervarix offers protection only against types 16 and 18, which account for about 70 percent of all cervical cancer cases. Today, such vaccines are used in about 120 countries and regions, including the United States, Australia and most European countries. As HPV is sexually transmitted, the World Health Organization recommends routine vaccination of girls age 9 to 13 because they are not as likely to have begun sexual activity. Qiao Youlin, a professor of epidemiology at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences' Cancer Hospital in Beijing, said the main target group of Cervarix is females age 9 to 26, although it is theoretically effective for women of all ages. Clinical trials discovered the vaccine is effective for women as old as 45, he said. According to the Securities Times newspaper, Zhifei Biological Products Co in Chongqing will promote, supply and sell the vaccine in China for the next three years. As the exclusive distributor of the vaccine, the company plans to purchase 1.14 billion yuan ($166 million) worth of Gardasil vaccines in the first year, 1.48 billion yuan in the second year and 1.85 billion yuan in the third year, the newspaper said.

Developed by the US-based company in 2006, the vaccine has proved effective in protecting against the virus, better known as HPV, the chief cause of cervical cancer. The virus is found in almost all cervical cancer cases. Gardasil is the first HPV vaccine in the world and the second to be licensed for use in China. In July, Cervarix, an HPV vaccine developed by pharmaceutical GlaxoSmithKline, received approval to be sold on the Chinese mainland after almost 10 years of seeking approval. Gardasil is expected to be commercially available on the mainland in three to six months, which means women will no longer have to seek vaccinations outside of the mainland, such as Hong Kong. After breast cancer, cervical cancer is the second-most common cancer in women ages 15 to 44 in China. Statistics from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention show China reports more than 130,000 cervical cancer cases a year, accounting for 28 percent of global total. The HPV vaccine, as the first anti-cancer vaccine in the world, has proved effective in preventing cervical cancer and is seen as a breakthrough in the fight against cancer. Gardasil offers protection against nine strains of HPV, including the two main cancer-causing varieties: type 16 and type 18. Cervarix offers protection only against types 16 and 18, which account for about 70 percent of all cervical cancer cases. Today, such vaccines are used in about 120 countries and regions, including the United States, Australia and most European countries. As HPV is sexually transmitted, the World Health Organization recommends routine vaccination of girls age 9 to 13 because they are not as likely to have begun sexual activity. Qiao Youlin, a professor of epidemiology at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences' Cancer Hospital in Beijing, said the main target group of Cervarix is females age 9 to 26, although it is theoretically effective for women of all ages. Clinical trials discovered the vaccine is effective for women as old as 45, he said. According to the Securities Times newspaper, Zhifei Biological Products Co in Chongqing will promote, supply and sell the vaccine in China for the next three years. As the exclusive distributor of the vaccine, the company plans to purchase 1.14 billion yuan ($166 million) worth of Gardasil vaccines in the first year, 1.48 billion yuan in the second year and 1.85 billion yuan in the third year, the newspaper said.

REUTERS/Robert Galbraith/Files By Bill Berkrot Amgen Inc and UCB SA said on Sunday they did not expect their experimental osteoporosis drug to win U.S. approval this year after a higher rate of serious heart-related side effects were observed in a late-stage clinical trial. The drug, romosozumab, which would be sold under the brand name Evenity if approved, is awaiting an approval decision by the Food and Drug Administration. But the new safety data, which cropped up in an otherwise successful trial, will have to be taken into consideration, delaying any FDA decision. "The efficacy results from this study comparing Evenity to an active control are robust. At the same time, the newly observed cardiovascular safety signal will have to be assessed as part of the overall benefit/risk profile for Evenity," Amgen research chief Sean Harper said in a statement. Evenity is considered to be a potentially important future growth driver for Amgen, and the surprise heart problems and delay in approval will likely not sit well with Amgen investors. The drug is also being considered for approval in Canada and Japan, the companies said. ISI Evercore analyst Umer Raffat in a research note called the new data "clearly negative and very surprising." Raffat said he was removing all sales of romosozumab from his Amgen forecast models and expected company shares to trade 3 to 4 percent lower on Monday. Amgen shares closed at $156.51 on Nasdaq on Friday. Analysts on average were forecasting annual sales of the drug to reach about $720 million by 2023, according to Thomson Reuters data. The medicine met the primary and key secondary goals of a late-stage study. The imbalance in heart-related side effects had not been observed in an earlier Phase III study that had been the basis of the regulatory submission seeking approvals. In the new trial, romosozumab significantly reduced the incidence of new vertebral fractures through 24 months as well as non-vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture compared with Merck & Co's Fosomax. Serious heart problems were reported, however, in 2.5 percent of patients who received the Amgen drug, versus 1.9 percent in the Fosomax group. Patients in the study received romosozumab for 12 months followed by treatment with Fosomax, known chemically as alendronate, compared with those who received only Fosomax, a current standard of care.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Better Buy: Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. vs. Agenus Inc. Celldex Therapeutics and Agenus have promising oncology pipelines, but which is the better stock right now? Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) May 21, 2017 at 6:41AM Immuno-oncology (I-O) development is a sizzling-hot area of focus for drug development these days. While many major pharmaceutical companies have either launched or are testing I-O drugs, several clinical-stage biotechs also are developing promising candidates. Celldex Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CLDX) and Agenus (NASDAQ:AGEN) are key players in that group. So far in 2017, however, neither stock has performed very well. Both have fallen around 13% year to date. Over the long run, however, Celldex and Agenus could emerge as big winners. But which is the better pick for investors? Here's how Celldex and Agenus compare in the three most important categories for clinical-stage biotechs -- pipelines, partnerships, and cash positions. Image source: Getty Images. Pipelines The story for Celldex was much different early last year than it is now. In March 2016, the biotech announced that its lead candidate, Rintega, had failed in a late-stage clinical study targeting treatment of glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. Celldex's stock plunged on the news, but investors still had hope: Celldex wasn't solely dependent on one drug. Although Celldex didn't have another experimental drug as far along in development as Rintega, the biotech did (and still does) have a couple of phase 2 candidates. Glembatumumab vedotin (glemba for short) is being evaluated in two phase 2 studies, one focusing on treatment of triple-negative breast cancer and the other on treatment of metastatic melanoma. Varlilumab (varli) is also being evaluated in phase 2 studies for treatment of colorectal cancer, metastatic melanoma, ovarian cancer, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and glioblastoma.  Glemba is Celldex's best hope for a relatively near-term win. If the results from the breast cancer study are positive, the company plans to submit the drug for regulatory approval and potentially launch the drug in 2019.  In addition to glemba and varli, Celldex also has three other early-stage pipeline candidates. CDX-0158 is a KIT inhibitor that is being studied as a potential treatment for gastrointestinal stromal tumors and other KIT-positive tumors. CDX-3379 blocks the activity of the ErbB3 receptor and is being evaluated in treating several solid tumors. CDX-014 targets T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-1 (TIM-1) in potentially treating kidney cancer.  Agenus has one product that already awaits regulatory approval. The biotech's QS-21 Stimulon adjuvant is used in GlaxoSmithKline's (NYSE:GSK) shingles and malaria vaccines. GlaxoSmithKline will find out later this year if its Shingrix shingles vaccine wins U.S. approval. The second most advanced candidate in Agenus' pipeline is Prophage, which is being evaluated in a phase 2 study as a vaccine for glioblastoma. Prophage has a long history. It's been in development for 16 years and has failed in clinical studies targeting other types of cancer, including metastatic melanoma and adjuvant renal cell carcinoma.  Perhaps the most promising prospects for Agenus, however, are with its checkpoint antibodies. The company has four candidates in early-stage clinical studies using different mechanisms to target various types of cancer: CTLA-4 antagonist AGEN1884, PD-1 antagonist AGEN2034, GITR antagonist INCAGN1876, and OX40 agonist INCAGN1949. In addition, Agenus is evaluating experimental cancer vaccine AutoSynVax in an early-stage study for which results are expected later this year.  Image source: Getty Images. Partnerships Both of these small biotechs have partnerships with big drugmakers. Celldex is collaborating with Bristol-Myers Squibb to study varli in combination with Opdivo. The relationship with Bristol-Myers Squibb has been a big financial boost for Celldex in recent quarters. Agenus, meanwhile, partnered with GlaxoSmithKline on the shingles and malaria vaccines mentioned earlier. The company also inked a deal with Incyte to develop several checkpoint antibodies. Incyte is fully funding the GITR and OX40 clinical programs and gave Agenus a cash infusion of $80 million in the first quarter. Merck also has taken an interest in Agenus. In 2014, the big drugmaker entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Agenus to develop  fully human antibodies for two undisclosed target indications. Merck selected a lead candidate for one of those undisclosed indications last year.  Cash positions At the end of the first quarter of 2017, Celldex reported cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $167.0 million. Celldex thinks this amount should carry it through 2018. However, there are two things to note. First, the company also anticipates generating more cash by selling its stock under an existing agreement. Second, Celldex's guidance assumes it will be able to pay future contingent milestones relating to its acquisition of Kolltan in stock rather than cash.  As for Agenus, the biotech reported a cash position of $124 million at the end of the first quarter (including cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments). Like Celldex, Agenus should be able to fund operations through 2018 with its current reserves but might need to raise money through another stock offering at some point in the future.  Better buy So which of these two biotechs is the better pick for investors? It's a tough decision. The primary importance of the two companies' partnerships with big drugmakers is that it helps provide investors some reassurance that there's real potential. I wouldn't say that either Celldex or Agenus really has the advantage in this area, since they both have attracted attention (and money) from solid companies. Although Celldex has a larger cash position, it's also spending more money than Agenus. The two biotechs are roughly in the same shape when it comes to cash. That means the choice comes down to which biotech has the best pipeline. Agenus has already monetized part of the future royalties it might get from GlaxoSmithKline's vaccine sales. Prophage's history of failures makes its success as a glioblastoma vaccine questionable. I do like the potential for Agenus' checkpoint antibodies, but they're all either in early-stage or pre-clinical testing. Celldex's glemba and varli, on the other hand, are more advanced than Agenus' promising checkpoint antibodies. Glemba could actually be on the market within the next couple of years if all goes well. Because of these reasons, I'd give the edge ever so slightly to Celldex as the better pick for now. Keith Speights has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Analysts said Sunday Janssen appeared to be trying to delay a Samsung biosimilar drug's entry into the U.S. market. In April, Samsung won approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to sell Renflexis -- its biosimilar of Janssen's blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis medicine Remicade. It was expected to go on sale in the world's largest pharmaceutical market late this year. Samsung Bioepis said Janssen, a subsidy of healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of New Jersey last week, claiming Samsung has infringed on three of its patents. It also asks for damages. Remicade generates nearly $5 billion (5.59 trillion won) in sales a year. "Janssen's patent lawsuit is an anticipated step. We will continue to proceed with the U.S. launch of Renflexis as planned," a Samsung official said. "Janssen takes issue with the same patents as it did with Celltrion's Inflectra." Janssen last year filed a lawsuit against Celltrion, a cross-city rival of Samsung Bioepis, with another Remicade biosimilar named Inflectra. The Patent Trial and Appeal Board ruled in favor of the Korean company, which released the medicine in the U.S. market last November. Observers expect that the legal action would not delay or prevent the U.S. market launch of the Samsung product, which Merck will take to market in November at the earliest. ksw@ktimes.comMore articles by this reporter 'Human spider' successfully scales 555-meter skyscraper with bare hands [PHOTOS] OECD finds S.

Diago McClain, founder and CEO of Worcester Pay It Forward, who grew up in Worcester and attended Holy Name High School, where he now coaches basketball three nights a week. In the last eight years, McClain has improved the lives of more than 3,500 Worcester area youth ages 4-18 through mentoring, coaching and leadership provided by PIF. The organization is dedicated to the development of young boys and girls through the game of basketball. Its mission is to teach local youth life skills and positive values through athletics, in order for those children to maximize their individual and educational potential. Children from Holden, Auburn, Shrewsbury, Paxton and Worcester’s most challenged neighborhood have benefited from PIF’s mission and McClain’s leadership. In partnership with Holy Name High School, McClain and PIF provide a variety of programs including the Tiny Tots basketball, Rise Against Bullying, summer basketball league, school vacation camps, travel basketball and WSUP peer mentoring. The Renaissance Award was established as an endowed prize through a gift by the late John W. Lund to show the community’s appreciation to those who serve in nonprofit roles. The award will come with a $5,000 cash prize. The award is given to an individual, not an agency, and is intended to be used for personal renewal. Selection is based on a record of dedicated commitment to the nonprofit sector, professional accomplishments and talent in fostering collaborative relationships. The annual meeting also publicly released the foundation’s financial reporting for 2016. With total assets exceeding $139.2 million comprised of permanent charitable endowments that are available for local grantmaking, the foundation awarded $6.6 million in grants and scholarships and received more than $5 million in contributions. A complete annual report can be found at http://greaterworcester.org. Syndax Pharmaceuticals announces results Syndax Pharmaceuticals Inc., of Waltham, a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing entinostat and SNDX-6352 in multiple cancer indications, announced results from the melanoma cohort of the ongoing Phase 2 ENCORE 601 trial of entinostat in combination with KEYTRUDA, Merck's anti-programmed death receptor-1 therapy, which will be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting being held June 2-6 in Chicago, Illinois. The company recently reported that the first cohort of 13 melanoma patients who had progressed on or after prior immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in ENCORE 601 met the pre-specified objective response criteria, with a minimum of two patients demonstrating a confirmed or unconfirmed objective response, to advance into the second stage of the trial. Data from the first cohort of patients indicate that four patients achieved an objective response by irRECIST criteria. ENCORE 601 is a Phase 1b/2 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of entinostat in combination with KEYTRUDA in melanoma patients whose disease had progressed despite prior treatment with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. Responses were seen both in patients who had, as well as those who had not, received prior treatment with YERVOY in combination with an anti-PD-1 therapy. Canine Capers 4-H Dog Club announces service project Members of the Canine Capers 4-H Dog Club, of Franklin, have launched an ongoing service project to support the canine military operations in the far east. The club, which meets weekly at MasterPeace Dog Training in Franklin, is seeking donations of supplies for both canine and human soldiers.

The drug, romosozumab, which would be sold under the brand name Evenity if approved, is awaiting an approval decision by the Food and Drug Administration. But the new safety data, which cropped up in an otherwise successful trial, will have to be taken into consideration, delaying any FDA decision. "The efficacy results from this study comparing Evenity to an active control are robust. At the same time, the newly observed cardiovascular safety signal will have to be assessed as part of the overall benefit/risk profile for Evenity," Amgen research chief Sean Harper said in a statement. Evenity is considered to be a potentially important future growth driver for Amgen, and the surprise heart problems and delay in approval will likely not sit well with Amgen investors. The drug is also being considered for approval in Canada and Japan, the companies said. ISI Evercore analyst Umer Raffat in a research note called the new data "clearly negative and very surprising." Raffat said he was removing all sales of romosozumab from his Amgen forecast models and expected company shares to trade 3 to 4 percent lower on Monday. Amgen shares closed at $156.51 on Nasdaq on Friday. Analysts on average were forecasting annual sales of the drug to reach about $720 million by 2023, according to Thomson Reuters data. The medicine met the primary and key secondary goals of a late-stage study. The imbalance in heart-related side effects had not been observed in an earlier Phase III study that had been the basis of the regulatory submission seeking approvals. In the new trial, romosozumab significantly reduced the incidence of new vertebral fractures through 24 months as well as non-vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture compared with Merck & Co's Fosomax. Serious heart problems were reported, however, in 2.5 percent of patients who received the Amgen drug, versus 1.9 percent in the Fosomax group. Patients in the study received romosozumab for 12 months followed by treatment with Fosomax, known chemically as alendronate, compared with those who received only Fosomax, a current standard of care.
