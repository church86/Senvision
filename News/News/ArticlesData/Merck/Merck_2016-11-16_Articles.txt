Gidget™ is designed as an easy-to-use witnessing and tracking system to reduce the potential for error and improve lab workflows, and Geri™+ is the basis to combine the Geri™ embryo incubator and the innovative Eeva® algorithm. Both new products underline Merck's healthcare strategy to provide innovation to patients / customers through best-in-class products.      (Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161116/440269 )      (Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161116/440270 ) "As the worldwide leader in fertility treatments, Merck continues to focus on innovation, in order to enable clinics to make individualized treatment decisions with and for their patients," said Rehan Verjee, Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer at the biopharma business of Merck. "Both Gidget™ and Geri™+ increase embryologists' options to provide the best possible treatment solutions for women and couples wanting to have a baby, such as offering greater safety and assurance for IVF patients and enabling a personalized workflow management and patient tracking." Gidget™ and Geri™+ stem from the ARTinnovations development hub, which Merck formed in collaboration with Genea Biomedx Propriety Ltd., Sydney, Australia. ARTinnovations is an incubator for ideas and innovations for fertility treatment and technologies. It combines the commitment and know-how of both partners to develop ideas that can take root and grow into better outcomes for patients. Integrating bright- and dark-field imaging, the Geri™+ incubator now allows for combination with the Eeva® software and any Geri Assess version. Geri+ becomes a multifunctional incubator, which gives embryologists a multitude of possibilities around embryo analytics. It brings together the benefits of undisturbed incubation, while complying with the high control and safety standards of the GeriTM incubator and the analytics of the Eeva® software, the first automated algorithm clinically shown to improve embryo assessment.[1],[2],[3] Gidget™ is a hand-held device for the IVF laboratory that lets the embryologist focus on the science by eliminating any chance of mismatching, and includes unique tracking and workflow features. It provides electronic witnessing, lab workflow management and support for traceability and audit reporting. Both products will be available immediately in Europe and Canada, with Gidget™ also launching in the US, Japan and additional regions set to follow soon. References          1. VerMilyea MD, et al.

Throughout 2016 Merck's Gonal-f fertility drug has benefited from reduced competition from Ferring's Bravelle range, which was pulled from the US market last year because of quality issues. In the third quarter Gonal-f grew 10% to €182m, a lower rate than in the prior two quarters. Merck's chief financial officer Marcus Kuhnert said "at least one" withdrawn product has now been returned to the market and the company "does not expect … this accelerated growth momentum in 2017". That's important because Gonal-f has buoyed Merck's healthcare unit in the face of declining sales for its two biggest products - injectable multiple sclerosis therapy Rebif (interferon beta-1a) and colorectal cancer therapy Erbitux (cetuximab) - which fell 5.5% to €436m and 1.9% to €219m, respectively. Sales of another key product, the diabetes drug Glucophage (metformin) are also in decline, falling 13.5% to €89m in the third quarter, and Merck is now looking to its pipeline to deliver new products that will push growth. Top of that list is oral MS therapy cladribine, which was submitted for approval in the EU in June, and according to Kuhnert is proceeding through regulatory review as expected. The company said recently it expects to see €2bn in revenue from new launches between 2017 and 2022, with a new product or indication launch every year. A large chunk of that increase is expected to come from Pfizer-partnered PD-L1 inhibitor avelumab, which is in phase III trials for several types of cancer, as Merck's only other late-stage candidate is a biosimilar version of AbbVie's TNF inhibitor Humira (adalimumab). Last year, Merck abandoned plans to seek approval of evofosfamide in advanced soft tissue sarcoma and pancreatic cancer after phase III study failures. Meanwhile, Merck suffered a setback in its mid-stage pipeline recently after its systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) candidate atacicept failed to meet its objectives in a clinical trial, although it did show efficacy in a subgroup of patients with high disease activity. "We are currently in consultations with the regulatory authorities and the scientific advisors to decide upon concrete next steps" for that programme, said Kuhnert. Overall, Merck reported 19% group sales growth to €3.7bn - driven largely by its acquisition of chemicals business Sigma-Aldrich - and the company has raised its earnings forecasts for the year.

Asian Scientist Newsroom | November 16, 2016 | Pharma AsianScientist (Nov. 16, 2016) - On November 4, 2016, science and technology company Merck inaugurated its €170 million Nantong pharmaceutical plant, its largest plant outside of Europe. The first drugs from the plant, which is dedicated to producing high-quality pharmaceuticals on China’s Essential Drug List, are expected to be delivered to patients in the second half of 2017. At the inauguration ceremony, Merck also announced a further investment of around €80 million in a Life Science Center near the Nantong pharmaceutical plant to manufacture high-purity inorganic salts, cell culture media products as well as ready-to-use media. This brings the company's total of investment in the production value chain in China to €250 million. These strategic investments further support Merck's expansion in China, which is expected to become the world’s second-largest pharmaceutical market by 2018, and enables the company to support the goals of China’s 13th Five Year Plan by investing in technology and developing local talent. “China is of strategic importance to Merck as a key driver of our sustainable growth. In line with our long-term commitment to China, Merck has always been dedicated to localizing global expertise to make a meaningful difference to our patients and life science customers,” said Mr. Stefan Oschmann, Chairman of the Executive Board and CEO of Merck. “Combining the strengths of our two business sectors Healthcare and Life Science, the Nantong site is a pioneering initiative to foster a comprehensive value chain that will create better access to health, enabling Merck to support China’s evolving developmental and healthcare priorities.” The Nantong site is designed to comply with the highest international standards in terms of quality, environment, health and safety. The site has invested in standard-setting wastewater treatment and disposal aimed at minimizing the environmental footprint of its operation to the local communities. ——— Source: Merck.

The MSD imposes a seven-cent tax increase per $100 of property value in the Central Business District. The money will go toward safety ambassadors, cleaning and development in the area. Council member Paul Lawler was the only “no” vote. Lawler suggested approving the MSD on the condition there be a three-year sunset on it. Other council members disagreed, citing the requirement that the MSD be reviewed annually, and that council may modify or remove it. Nearly a dozen people spoke at the council meeting during the public hearing. Supporters said MSDs in other parts of the state have proven to be effective and improve downtown’s image. Opponents argued against raising taxes, and claimed some of the services provided by an MSD are unnecessary. One resident who spoke at the meeting said now that council has spoken, she would like to see a more concrete plan. "I want a more clear-cut vision of what they're proposing,” Shelia Gasquet. “Right now it seems a little broad to me. So let's make sure that those dollars are going to benefit people other than the first Front Street, you know Second and Third Street." Council will have to vote again at a second reading of the proposal to make the MSD official. That hearing is set for December. If approved, the MSD would become effective in July 2017. MSDs exist in more than 50 cities in the state, but the debate to establish one to Wilmington has lasted almost a year.  More than a dozen downtown business owners and residents spoke during the public hearing during a City Council meeting last month. The crowd was split between those in favor and against the MSD for the Central Business District. During a City Council agenda meeting in November, council member Kevin O'Grady brought up the concerns of a resident that lives on the very edge of the proposed district.  “The big residential properties in the middle of the district are clearly going to benefit because whatever services are provided will surround them," O'Grady said. "But these are really side streets, and I’m not certain how they benefit. They may benefit from the safety issues and the maybe the cleanliness issues. But I’d like some assurance that if they’re going to be included, services are going to reach these limits." Copyright 2016 WECT. All rights reserved.

The company topped the Access to Medicines Index for the fifth consecutive time after the biannual good practice report found it “the most access-oriented company” of the top 20 pharma firms. GSK has maintained its ranking thanks to a series of solo and collaborative R&D projects targeting high-priority product gaps in low- and middle-income countries. This is despite the lower commercial returns involved and the firm was one of six companies found to consistently address gaps in local healthcare infrastructures. The Access to Medicines ranking largely reflects this trend as GSK, Johnson & Johnson, Merck KGaA and Merck & Co take the top five places, joined by AstraZeneca, which climbed eight places to rank seventh. The Index also cited GSK's product donations - where it scored four out of a possible five points - and voluntary licensing, such as ViiV Healthcare's agreement with the Medicine Patent Pool to cover HIV drug dolutegravir in developing countries, as examples of good practice. However, the UK-based pharma company was found to fall back in compliance, where it picked up less than half the available points. The primary cause for GSK faltering in this area was the bribery and corruption scandal uncovered in 2013 that saw the firm fined $487m by the Chinese authorities. The report did, however, commend the company for its steps to prevent such breaches in future, which include eliminating individual sales targets and implementing a new revolving-door hiring policy to alleviate any conflict of interest risk. GSK's chief executive Sir Andrew Witty, said: “This is a testament to everyone at GSK, and our partners, who strive every day to research and deliver innovative medicines and vaccines. “These efforts mean that more children in the poorest countries are being immunised against deadly diseases; more patients can receive the HIV and asthma medicines they need; and essential healthcare is reaching the remotest communities.” Established in 2008, the Index is funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in partnership with the UK and Dutch governments and aims to encourage big pharma to play its part in delivering medicines to the two billion people who currently go without. Only 5% of products covered by pricing strategies currently meet affordability criteria in priority access countries, according to the 2016 Index, despite companies increasingly waiving patent rights in priority regions. Large, middle-income countries are particularly affected, with places like Mexico, Ukraine and Thailand that house the majority of the world's poor still excluded from access schemes and licensing. Seeking to address this, the Index found that collaborative research initiatives appeared most effective in engaging pharma in developing high-need, low-incentive therapies, with 67% of R&D projects in this area conducted in partnership. Once again GSK is leading the pack, with 32 pipeline projects in this area, followed by AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson with 19 and 17 respectively. Witty added: “As a business, and an industry, we must push ourselves to go further and faster in strengthening access to healthcare. This is a challenge we are willing a ready to take on.” The Access to Medicines Index 2016 View the Access to Medicines Index 2016 case studies Please enable JavaScript to view the comments.

As the global population grows and ages, the highest toll will be among women in poor and middle-income countries, it said, and much of it from cancers which are largely preventable. “Most of the deaths occur in young- and middle-aged adults,”, placing a heavy burden on families and national economies, said Sally Cowal, senior vice president of global health at the American Cancer Society, which compiled the report with pharmaceutical company Merck. The review “highlights the large geographic inequality in availability of resources and preventive measures and treatment to combat the growing burden of cancer,” she told AFP. Cancer is already killing one in seven women around the world, said the report — the second highest cause of death after cardiovascular disease. All four of the deadliest cancers — breast, colorectal, lung and cervical cancer — are mostly preventable or can be detected early, when treatment is more successful. In poorer countries, a much smaller proportion of cancer cases are diagnosed and treated than in rich ones, while a much bigger group dies. The relative burden is growing for developing countries as people live longer due to better basic healthcare. Women in these countries are also increasingly exposed to known cancer risk factors “associated with rapid economic transition,” said Cowal, “such as physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, obesity, and reproductive factors” such as postponing motherhood. “Due to these changes, cancers that were once common only in high-income countries are becoming more prevalent,” said the report entitled “The Global Burden of Cancer in Women.” It was presented Tuesday at the World Cancer Congress in Paris. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, there were 6.7 million new cancer cases and 3.5 million deaths among women worldwide in 2012. Of these, 56 percent of cases and 64 percent of deaths were in less developed countries. “These numbers are expected to increase to 9.9 million cases and 5.5 million deaths among females annually by 2030 as a result of the growth and ageing of the population,” said the new report. – Regional differences – The biggest concentration is in eastern Asia, with 1.7 million cases and a million deaths in 2012, mainly in China. The report said the highest ratio of cancer cases per population group are still reported in high-income countries in Europe, the Americas and Asia, but this was partly due to better access to screening and detection. Deaths, however, were proportionally much higher in low- and middle-income countries with reduced access to diagnosis and treatment. The countries with the highest death rate were Zimbabwe, Malawi, Kenya, Mongolia and Papua New Guinea. Breast and lung cancer are the two most common types in both rich and poor nations, with colorectal cancer the number three killer in developed countries, and cervical cancer in less developed ones. Cervical cancer can be staved off by vaccination against the cancer-causing Human papillomavirus (HPV), and can be easily detected through regular Papanicolaou (pap) test screens. “Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in 140 countries worldwide and cervical cancer is the most common in 39 countries, all of which are LMICs (low- and medium-income countries),” said the report. It said the global economic burden of cancer for both genders was about $286 billion (261 billion euros) in 2009, including costs for treatment and care, and loss of workforce productivity.

By MichaelBrush Columnist The Republican sweep of Washington has generated a ton of enthusiasm for biotech stocks. They’re up 10% to 15% since the elections. As a result, biotech analysts’ phones are ringing off the hook again after a depressingly bleak October. “I feel like a rejuvenated man,” says RBC Capital Markets biotech analyst Michael Yee. “Once again, people are coming back to talk about biotech. We are back in gear.” But can the Donald Trump biotech rally really last? In short, yes. Republican control of the White House and both branches of Congress brings such a fundamental shift for the sector that more gains inevitably lie ahead, with the normal volatility that always comes with biotech stocks, of course. “My sense is stay long,” says Yee. “Stay the course. The path of least resistance is higher.” Here are seven reasons why. Reason 1: The government drug-price-control threat is gone for now With Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton relegated to the sidelines, the days when they could shave billions in market value off the group with a single tweet against “high” drug prices are over. Also, California rejected a key initiative, Proposition 61, that would have benchmarked the state’s drug prices to those that the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs gets, essentially the lowest prices in the U.S. “If the most liberal state in the country voted against Prop 61, a model for what extreme government drug-pricing controls could look like, it certainly seems to us like Bernie Sanders’ pipe dream isn’t going to materialize,” says Baird biotech analyst Brian Skorney. He thinks the biggest beneficiaries of this shift will be companies with unique products that face minimal competition, but were hit the most by concerns about price controls. He cites Vertex Pharmaceuticals VRTX, -1.93% Sarepta Therapeutics SRPT, +0.03% BioMarin Pharmaceutical BMRN, -1.92% Celgene CELG, -0.09% and Alexion Pharmaceuticals ALXN, -2.54% To be sure, state pushback on drug pricing is not over. A measure similar to Proposition 61 is on the ballot in Ohio next year. But so far, only Vermont has passed a law pushing back on drug prices. In contrast, Prop 61-like legislation has failed in five states, points out Jefferies analyst Brian Abrahams. Reason 2: An “explosion” of mid-cap biotech buyouts is on the way “For a year and a half, people have recognized that the big pharmaceutical companies need to replenish their pipelines,” says Brad Loncar, of Loncar Investments, which specializes in biotech companies, particularly those looking for cancer cures. The toxic political environment and uncertainly about drug-price controls have probably held them back. Now those threats are diminished. And another huge mergers-and-acquisitions catalyst lies around the corner: Trump wants to change tax laws to make it easier for U.S. companies to repatriate foreign earnings stashed abroad. Jefferies analyst Steven DeSanctis estimates that $112 billion could flow back to U.S.-based pharma and biotech companies like Johnson & Johnson JNJ, -0.35% Pfizer PFE, -0.79% and Merck MRK, -1.32% as a result. The upshot is that any of them could engage in “large-scale” M&A in 2017. “We should see an explosion of deal activity,” says DeSanctis. “With Trump being more business-friendly, we feel that deal activity will persist for a long time.” Companies don’t actually have to wait for the money to arrive to arrange deals, as long as they see that tax-law changes are in the works to clear the way. “We believe these companies only need to have visibility into tax reform to begin to execute, as low-interest debt could be raised in the near term and paid down once the new legislation is passed,” says Skorney. Jay Silverman, who writes the Medical Technology Stock Letter, expects at least one deal before year-end. But that could be a modest estimate. The reason: November and December are historically the two biggest months for biotech M&A, says Jefferies’ Abrahams. Who will get bought out? No one really knows. But here are some educated guesses from the experts. * Yee, at RBC Capital Markets, puts Biogen BIIB, -0.72% Incyte INCY, -1.82% and BioMarin high on his list of potential buyout candidates. * Skorney, at Baird, cites Neurocrine Biosciences NBIX, -2.41% Axovant Sciences AXON, -2.33% Sarepta, BioMarin and Tesaro TSRO, -1.60% from his coverage universe. * Silverman, at the Medical Technology Stock Letter, cites Ionis Pharmaceuticals IONS, -2.76% Incyte and The Medicines Co. MDCO, -0.05% from among the names his publication covers. From my stock newsletter, Brush Up on Stocks, and my own personal holdings, I’ll cite Acadia Pharmaceuticals ACAD, +1.48% which has been frequently rumored as a buyout candidate in the press. Reason 3: The glass is half full again For too long, biotech investors have been damned if their companies do, and damned if they don’t. In other words, they got hammered if their companies’ drug candidates disappointed in study results. But biotech has been so widely hated, there were few buyers to reward companies for positive results. Biotech investing was a lose-lose. But now, with a lot of the political rhetoric against biotech companies off the table because Trump pushed Sanders and Clinton to the sidelines, biotech stocks can react to fundamentals again, points out Yee. “There is more positive risk-reward on clinical events,” he says. “Now fundamentals matter. It’s a glass-half-full market.” Positive clinical results can come from any company at any moment. Biomarin, Incyte and AstraZeneca AZN, -0.84% all have potentially good news coming out over the next several months, for example. But the big one everyone is watching is Eli Lilly LLY, -1.34% Between now and year-end, Lilly is expected to announce results in its studies on the use of a drug called solanezumab against Alzheimer’s disease. There’s no cure for this disease. So this could be a big catalyst for the group. Reason 4: Market-moving conferences are around the bend Market-moving study results also pop out at industry conferences. A few key meetings lie just around the corner. The American Society of Hematology (ASH) meeting will take place in early December. That will be followed by the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. Then there’s the Super Bowl of biotech, the J.P. Morgan 35th Annual Healthcare Conference 2017, in early January. Reason 5: Food & Drug Administration reform may help Trump has promised FDA reform “to put greater focus on the need of patients for new and innovative medical products.” It’s not entirely clear what he has in mind. But most likely this means less-stringent standards for drug approval. If this goes through, it could be a positive for biotech companies, though the timing is uncertain. Reason 6: A medical-device tax repeal is likely The Affordable Care Act (ACA), or Obamacare, imposed a 2.3% tax on medical-device manufacturers. That tax is now likely to be repealed next year, says Cowen analyst Eric Assaraf. This would benefit medical-device makers like Medtronic MDT, -1.06% Baxter International BAX, -0.25% Abbott Laboratories ABT, -1.36% and Johnson & Johnson. Hillary Clinton tells supporters to 'never, ever give up'(1:22) Reason 7: Mutual fund managers play catch-up in biotech Biotech was so despised for so much of 2016, thanks to Clinton’s and Sanders’ rhetoric against drug prices, that many fund managers were underweight. So they got burned badly by the recent biotech rally. That means they are more likely to underperform indices and benchmarks, which contain a lot of biotech. So now they have to play catch-up. “There’s a real sense that investors were completely caught offside with the election,” says Yee at RBC. “People have to start scurrying to get back on side. Generalists are still trying to figure it all out. That’s going to drive a lot of money to biotech.” In short, any pullbacks could be shallow as fund managers use retreats to increase exposure to the group. Biotech risks Of course, biotech being biotech, there are always risks. You can expect the typical roller-coaster ride with these stocks as a result, and you should not invest in this group unless you can deal with that, psychologically. * One of the key risks is that Trump has vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare. Since Obamacare has extended health insurance to over 20 million people, a repeal would cause a noticeable cutback in health-care spending. However, as I’ve argued, it’s pretty unlikely that Trump will be able to change Obamacare in a way that takes health insurance away from 20 million people. * There can be surprise headlines at any moment, like the recent news that the Department of Justice is investigating possible collusion on generic drug prices. * Biotech is a “high beta” group, another way of saying that if falls more than a lot of other groups in any broad market pullback, which can happen at any moment. * Finally, while Sanders and Clinton have been neutralized in their capacity to tank the sector with tweets, the drug-price issue has not gone away. Insurance companies will continue to resist high prices and demand follow-up studies from drug companies to prove that their products help patients. “The election does not mean the sector’s problems are going away, by any means,” says Loncar. “The government is only part of this story.” At the time of publication, Michael Brush held INCY and ACAD.

17, 2016, 08:00 ET Share this article LONDON, November 17, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Deborah I Friedman, US Neurology , 2016;12(2):84-9: https://doi.org/10.17925/USN.2016.12.02.84      (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151014/276718LOGO ) Published recently in US Neurology, the peer-reviewed journal from touchNEUROLOGY, Deborah I Friedman discusses a new treatment in migraine. This condition remains a common debilitating condition that exerts a high social and economic burden worldwide. Despite the widespread availability of various medications for migraine, many patients are dissatisfied with their treatment. Rapid and effective treatment at an early stage in an attack is vital in migraine to prevent central sensitization leading to attacks that are difficult to treat. Most migraineurs prefer oral medications but this is not always the most rapid or efficient route into the bloodstream. Intranasal administration of migraine treatment provides a rapid, convenient and reliable alternative to oral and other routes. AVP-825 is an intranasal medication delivery system approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in January 2016 as ONZETRA™ Xsail™ (sumatriptan nasal powder [Avanir Pharmaceuticals, Aliso Viejo, CA]) for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. AVP-825 contains low dose sumatriptan powder and takes advantage of some unique aspects of the nasal anatomy to confer rapid pain relief in the acute treatment of migraine. In two Phase III trials, AVP-825 was well tolerated and showed significantly faster migraine pain relief and relief from other symptoms including photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea than placebo or oral sumatriptan. This benefit was achieved with substantially lower drug exposure than oral sumatriptan. Additional analyses of data from the Phase III trials show that significantly more patients with migraine receiving AVP-825 reported clinically meaningful relief, sustained relief, pain freedom, lower migraine-related disability and more consistent relief across multiple attacks than those receiving oral sumatriptan. The rapid and sustained action of AVP-825 and its convenience creates the potential for this unique treatment to reduce the burden of migraine in many patients.

The tech sector was the day’s leading gainer, but was more than offset in the DJIA and S&P 500 indexes by financials and utilities which led the losers. WTI crude oil for December delivery settled at $45.57 a barrel, down 0.5% for the day. December gold dropped less than 0.1% on the day to settle at $1,223.90. Equities were headed for a mixed close before the bell as the DJIA traded down 0.32% for the day, the S&P 500 traded down 0.20%, and the Nasdaq Composite traded up 0.32%. The DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage loss ahead of the close Wednesday was JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) which traded down 2.81% at $77.13. The stock’s 52-week range is $52.50 to $80.44. Volume was roughly equal to the daily average of around 16 million shares. The big bank had no specific news. The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) traded down 2.32% at $206.28. The stock’s 52-week range is $138.20 to $211.77. Trading volume was about 35% above the daily average of around 3 million. Investors could have been taking some profits in financial stocks that have run up sharply since last week’s elections. Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) traded down 1.74% at $62.54. The stock’s 52-week range is $47.97to $65.46. Volume was about 25% below the daily average of around 6.8 million shares. The company had no specific news Wednesday, but pharmaceutical stocks, like financials, may have seen some profit-taking. Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) traded down 1.27% at $85.71. The stock’s 52-week range is $71.55 to $95.55. Volume was about half the daily average of around 10.7 million shares. The EIA report on oil inventories showed a bigger-than-expected build and a rather modest production decline. Of the Dow 30 stocks 12 are on track to close higher Wednesday and 18 are set to close lower.
