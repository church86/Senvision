Watson Labs raises a core substantive patent issue – does the on sale bar apply to secret sales? The defendant asks: Whether the “on sale” bar found in § 102(b) applies only to sales or offers of sale made available to the public, as Congress, this Court, and the United States have all made clear, or whether it also applies to non-public sales or offers of sale, as the Federal Circuit has held. The Merck petition is focused on pre-AIA patents.  The PTO (and patentees) are arguing more forcefully that the AIA certainly intended to exclude secret sales from the scope of prior art in cases now pending before the Federal Circuit. The second new substantive patent law case is Google v. Arendi that challenge’s the Federal Circuit’s limitations on the use of common sense in the obviousness analysis.  In its decision, the Federal Circuit limited KSR to combination patents and held that “common sense” cannot be used to supply missing limitations.  Google argues that the Federal Circuit’s approach is contrary to the broad and flexible obviousness analysis required by KSR.  Patentees bristle term “common sense” – they see an overly flexible analysis as providing opportunities to invalidate patents without evidence.  The question: “Did the Federal Circuit err in restricting the Board’s ability to rely on the common sense and common knowledge of skilled artisans to establish the obviousness of patent claims?” As these new petitions were being filed, the Supreme Court has also denied the pending obviousness, anticipation, and eligibility petitions.  In addition, Cooper v. Square has also been denied. Civil Procedure: In J&J v. Rembrandt, the defendant J&J won at trial. However, Rembrandt later learned that J&J’s expert had testified falsely and the Federal Circuit ordered the case re-opened under R.60(b)(3) that empowers district courts to revisit final judgments after a showing of “fraud …, misrepresentation, or misconduct by the opposing party.”  The various circuits follow different standards and procedures for analyzing process and J&J has asked the Supreme Court to reconcile these (in its favor).  Another CivPro petition was also filed by Eon Corp that questions whether an appellee needed to file a R.50 JMOL motion to overturn a jury verdict that was based upon a faulty legal conclusion by the district court (here claim construction).  The Question Presented is: Whether the Federal Circuit erred in ordering entry of judgment as a matter of law on a ground not presented in a Rule 50 motion in the district court, even though the ground presented a purely legal question. Both J&J and Eon are only marginally patent cases, the core procedure case now pending is TC Heartland that would substantially upset the status quo of patent lawsuit concentration in E.D. Texas. Briefing continues in TC Heartland. In recent weeks a set of seven amici briefs were filed on the top side. Next week Supreme Court conference includes review of the most likely-to-be-granted petition of Impression Products, Inc. v. Lexmark International, Inc. that focuses on important questions of post-sale exhaustion of patent rights.  The setup – If I buy a used product that was made and sold by the patentee, do I still need to worry that I might get sued for patent infringement?  The Federal Circuit says yes. The Supreme Court is likely to add some caveats to that.  The US Government (Obama Administration via DOJ) has argued that the case should be reviewed and that the Federal Circuit’s position should be rejected. Both parties then filed supplemental responsive briefs.  Lexmark’s best argument here is that these principles are well settled and that Congress can take on the role of tweaking them if needed.

Morgan says: November 14, 2016 at 5:59 pm I think there could be a lot clearer fact case in which to decide “secret sales” issues either before or after the AIA [two different questions] than Merck & Cie v. Watson Labs. Reply link does not work in your browser because JavaScript is disabled. Reply 3 Night Writer says: November 14, 2016 at 4:17 pm I predicted this long ago. Why? Because if the IPR was found to be unconstitutional, then all that IPR work would go back to the district courts. Basically, the question before the justices was whether they wanted more patent work.

Reply 2 MM says: November 14, 2016 at 4:09 pm Hey, let’s hear it for the poor, poor “small inventors” like Adrian Pelkus who weeps and moans that “patents are a liability” over at the Professional Entitled Whiner’s Club: link to wsj.com Adrian Pelkus, a San Marcos, Calif., business owner used home-equity loans to fund at least six start-up businesses in the past 15 years. He started his flagship company, A Squared Technologies Inc., which makes circuit boards for electronics manufacturers, with a $10,000 loan against his home in 1985. But Mr. Pelkus has been thwarted by the housing bust. In 2008, he says, he hit on his best idea yet—to generate power from ocean waves. He patented the idea and produced a prototype for the product, and planned to borrow against his home to do lab tests and market the idea to investors. But by 2009, Southern California prices had declined so far that Mr. Pelkus was underwater by more than $100,000 on the three houses he owns near San Diego. Oh, poor, poor Mr. “Small Inventor” Pelkus! He “only” owned three houses near San Diego! At least he could remember the number, unlike poor persecuted John “Every Sunday” McCain (R) … Life is so, so brutally tough for the “small” innovators. *sniffle* Reply link does not work in your browser because JavaScript is disabled.

Upcoming Supreme Court Oral Argument: Life Tech (export of components) set for December 6, 2016. This is going to be a very b0ring argument but at least the CAFC’s ridiculous decision will be quickly reversed. It’ll probably be a three page opinion by the Supremes.

Reply link does not work in your browser because JavaScript is disabled. Reply 1.1.2 Jonathan says: November 15, 2016 at 7:49 am As I pointed out previously on this blog, the Cooper et al. arguments challenging the constitutionality of the IPR were likely to fail. The cert. petitioners erroneous emphasize and focus in their challenge on a violation of the separation of power doctrine is not the route to go challenging the IPR .This is because the SC has held (several times) that Congress has plenary power related to the patents. According to the SC a patent is primary created by a federal statue (albeit with property rights elements). The only way to successfully challenge the constitutionality of the IPR is to look to the non-delegation doctrine and to argue that the IPR does not meet the “intelligible principle” test.

Reply 1.2.1 MM says: November 14, 2016 at 3:26 pm A disappointing result for an important and provocative question. Everyone should feel free to continue to ask and answer the “provocative questions” to their heart’s content. They never seemed very provocative to me. They seemed like desperate Hail Mary’s tossed by entitled people who wanted their junky patents to remain as valuable as possible for as long as possible. The result is awesome for those up looking for an efficient way to clean up the worst messes in our messed up patent system. Even better (and more efficient) would be some clarity from the Supreme as to whether logic and information can be protected by patents merely by salting the claim with references to conventional computer hardware. We already know that logic and information by themselves are ineligible for patent protection. Nobody’s seriously questioning that. Maybe someone should ask Trump what he thinks. Onwards!

But it is not taking into consideration all the various arguments made in professional amicus briefs that were variously filed in the three failed cert petitions challenging post-grant proceeding statutes, Including the NYC association. Furthermore, everyone had ample opportunity to contact parties or amici to proffer unconstitutionality arguments even if they were not already fully aware of them from numerous blog comments. “Not understanding the takings issue well enough” can hardly be said of the genuine constitutional law experts retained by these parties or participating in the amicus briefs.

Merck Diabetes Award as part of the Merck Capacity Advancement Programme was launched in April 2016 in partnership with African and Asian universities with the aim of building a platform of diabetes experts across the globe. “Merck plays an important role in building Diabetes Care capacity in partnership with African and Asian Universities. Today marks an important day in the fight against Diabetes as we celebrate World Diabetes Day. In this context, we have announced ten Diabetes Award Winners from Africa and Asia” Belen Garijo, member of Merck’s Executive Board and CEO Merck Healthcare, said. “This initiative fully illustrates our commitment to improving access to affordable Healthcare in Africa and other developing countries,” Garijo added. The scientific committee received over 500 concept submission applications from universities in Africa and Asia and 10 winners were selected for the award. The winner from each university has been granted a one year postgraduate diabetes diploma in South Wales University, United Kingdom. “Merck Diabetes Award marks another step in our long term commitment to support diabetes care strategies in developing countries through working with local governments, academia and relevant stakeholders in building healthcare capacity with a focus on Diabetes, hypertension and other non-communicable diseases in various countries in Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Africa and Latin America,” Rasha Kelej, chief social officer, Merck Healthcare, said when making the announcement of the winners. Merck invited all medical students to apply for the “Merck Diabetes Award” 2016 with the theme “Every Day is a Diabetes Day”. Students across African and Asian medical universities were asked to submit a concept paper on how to improve diabetes early detection and prevention in their countries and how to encourage their society, scientific community, local authorities, media and relevant stakeholders to think and act on diabetes every day. “Access to diabetic care in Africa will slowly grow with the initiation of this award, because it will create ‘diabetes scholars’ with more insight and knowledge on the best care needed for patients and how to facilitate it,” Dominic Oduro-Donkor, a Merck Diabetes Award winner, said from Cape Coast Teaching Hospital, Ghana. “The Merck Capacity Advancement Programme is a ground-breaking initiative to control this growing epidemic of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like diabetes, by motivating and sensitising undergraduate students and giving them a chance to gain an in-depth knowledge about every aspect of this disease,” Antara Bagchi, another winner and a student at the Indira Gandhi Medical College, India, said. Ahmed Reja, president of the International Diabetes Federation, Africa and President of Ethiopia Diabetes Association said: “We are very happy to partner with Merck to drive their strategy to build diabetes capacity and roll out the Merck Diabetes Award across the continent. The awards encourage the students to be more innovative and take a leadership position to fight diabetes in their own country.” In addition, as part of its recognition of the World Diabetes Day, the Merck Capacity Advancement Program also launched its European Accredited Clinical Diabetes and Hypertension management 2016 tour across Africa and Asia. The programme supports focused training to build diabetes healthcare capacity for medical undergraduates, postgraduates and healthcare providers in partnership with universities across the two continents. More than 5000 medical undergraduates have benefited from the fourth edition of the Merck Capacity Advancement Program which covered eight African countries and is in partnership with Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia; University of Nairobi, Kenya; Makerere University, Uganda; Muhimbili University, Tanzania; University of Ghana; University of Namibia; Eduardo Mondelane University in Mozambique and Agostinho Neto University, Angola. In Asia the tours are being conducted with Maharashtra University, India and University of Indonesia. In addition to building capacity among healthcare professionals to provide quality diabetes care, Merck runs a social media campaign providing diabetes patient education through videos and information materials in English, French, Portuguese, Spanish, and many local languages focusing on diabetes early symptoms and complications to raise awareness on diabetes and the importance of early detection and prevention among communities. — Nov 14, 2016 @ 15:40 GMT | No Comments Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Skip to content Military Technologies Military Press Releases OpGen Collaborates With Merck to Develop Novel Rapid Diagnostics and Informatics Tools to Combat Antibiotic Resistance GAITHERSBURG, M.d., Nov. 14, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — OpGen, Inc. (NASDAQ:OPGN) today announced it has entered into a research collaboration with Merck, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, to develop new rapid diagnostics and information technology products to help combat the threat of antimicrobial resistance. The companies will collaborate to support OpGen’s development of rapid DNA tests and a genomic knowledgebase of antibiotic-resistant pathogens for predicting antibiotic susceptibility based on test results. Under the terms of the agreement, Merck will provide access to its archive of over 200,000 bacterial pathogens gathered over the last 15 years through the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART), one of the world’s largest surveillance studies of antimicrobial resistance supported by Merck in collaboration with International Health Management Associates (IHMA). OpGen will perform genomic analysis, microbiology testing for drug resistance, and incorporate this information into its Acuitas® Lighthouse Knowledgebase and the development of rapid DNA tests. This new molecular testing and informatics approach is being developed to help transform antibiotic decision making for doctors managing acute care patients with blood, respiratory, urinary tract, and soft tissue infections. In addition to identifying resistance determinants to predict antibiotic failures, the OpGen technology is being evaluated as the foundation for utilizing molecular diagnostic tests to predict pathogen susceptibility and guide patient management choices to improve patient outcomes. “This collaboration builds upon the promise of our DNA-based genetic tests, Lighthouse Knowledgebase and antibiotic resistance decision making tools to make a significant impact on hospital infections,” said Evan Jones, chairman and CEO of OpGen. “Access to Merck’s SMART surveillance network data has the potential to greatly accelerate our internal development efforts in validating our rapid diagnostic tools and bolster data acquisition for our Lighthouse Knowledgebase.” Recent studies have indicated that antimicrobial resistant infections currently claim 50,000 lives each year across the United States and Europe alone, with many hundreds of thousands more dying in other areas of the world. In September, world leaders at the United Nations called rising antimicrobial resistance a fundamental threat to human health, development, and security. As a result, for the first time, Heads of State committed to taking a broad, coordinated approach to combat rising antimicrobial resistance including the development of new medicines and rapid diagnostics. “Rapid diagnostics for pathogen identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing are central to developing global solutions for antimicrobial resistance,” said Dr. Eliav Barr, senior vice president, Infectious Diseases and Vaccines Clinical Development, Merck Research Laboratories. “By providing OpGen with access to our archive of bacterial pathogens, we hope to expedite the development of rapid diagnostic tests and enable prompt and informed antibiotic prescribing to improve patient outcomes.” OpGen will initially perform molecular analyses on up to 10,000 pathogens to identify markers of resistance to support rapid decision making using the Acuitas Lighthouse® MDRO Management System (“Lighthouse Portal”), and to speed development of OpGen’s rapid diagnostic platforms. OpGen’s Lighthouse Portal and Knowledgebase are being developed to provide antibiotic stewardship and tracking information for drug resistant pathogens in hospitals and health systems. Merck will gain access to the high-resolution genotype data for the SMART isolates as well as access to OpGen’s Lighthouse Portal to support internal research and development programs. About the SMART Study The Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) was initiated by Merck in 2002 to monitor the in vitro susceptibility of clinical isolates to 12 commonly used antibiotics in different regions of the world to survey changing trends in antibiotic susceptibility. SMART currently monitors antibiotic activity against gram-negative bacteria isolated from two common types of infection: intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections. Isolates have been collected from patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections since 2002 and from patients with complicated urinary tract infections since 2010. In 2016, Merck anticipates that more than 41,000 isolates will be collected. This research agreement is executed between OpGen and Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Merck & Co. Inc. The Merck Global Health Innovation Fund, a venture capital arm of Merck, is an investor in OpGen Inc. About OpGen OpGen, Inc. is harnessing the power of informatics and genomic analysis to provide complete solutions for patient, hospital and network-wide infection prevention and treatment.

Merck Diabetes Award as part of the Merck Capacity Advancement Program (www.Merck-CAP.com) was launched in April 2016 in partnership with African and Asian universities with the aim of building a platform of diabetes experts across the globe. “Merck plays an important role in building Diabetes Care capacity in partnership with African and Asian Universities. Today marks an important day in the fight against Diabetes as we celebrate World Diabetes Day. In this context, we have announced ten Diabetes Award Winners from Africa and Asia” says Belen Garijo, Member of Merck's Executive Board and CEO Merck Healthcare. “This initiative fully illustrates our commitment to improving access to affordable Healthcare in Africa and other developing countries” Garijo added. The scientific committee received over 500 concept submission applications from universities in Africa and Asia and 10 winners were selected for the award. The winner from each university has been granted a one year postgraduate diabetes diploma in South Wales University, United Kingdom. “Merck Diabetes Award marks another step in our long term commitment to support diabetes care strategies in developing countries through working with local governments, academia and relevant stakeholders in building healthcare capacity with a focus on Diabetes, hypertension and other non-communicable diseases in various countries in Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Africa and Latin America” said Rasha Kelej, Chief Social Officer, Merck Healthcare when making the announcement of the winners. Merck invited all medical students to apply for the “Merck Diabetes Award” 2016 with the theme “Every Day is a Diabetes Day”. Students across African and Asian medical universities were asked to submit a concept paper on how to improve diabetes early detection and prevention in their countries and how to encourage their society, scientific community, local authorities, media and relevant stakeholders to think and act on diabetes every day. “Access to diabetic care in Africa will slowly grow with the initiation of this award, because it will create ‘diabetes scholars’ with more insight and knowledge on the best care needed for patients and how to facilitate it,” said Dominic Oduro-Donkor, from Cape Coast Teaching Hospital, Ghana and a Merck Diabetes Award winner. “The Merck Capacity Advancement Programme is a ground-breaking initiative to control this growing epidemic of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like diabetes, by motivating and sensitising undergraduate students and giving them a chance to gain an in-depth knowledge about every aspect of this disease,” emphasized one of the winners Antara Bagchi, a student at the Indira Gandhi Medical College, India. Ahmed Reja, the President of International Diabetes Federation, Africa and President of Ethiopia Diabetes Association emphasized: “We are very happy to partner with Merck to drive their strategy to build diabetes capacity and roll out the Merck Diabetes Award across the continent. The awards encourage the students to be more innovative and take a leadership position to fight diabetes in their own country.” In addition, as part of its recognition of the World Diabetes Day, the Merck Capacity Advancement Program also launched its European Accredited Clinical Diabetes and Hypertension management 2016 tour across Africa and Asia. The program supports focused training to build diabetes healthcare capacity for medical undergraduates, postgraduates and healthcare providers in partnership with universities across the two continents. More than 5000 medical undergraduates have benefited from the fourth edition of the Merck Capacity Advancement Program which covered eight African countries and is in partnership with Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia; University of Nairobi, Kenya; Makerere University, Uganda; Muhimbili University, Tanzania; University of Ghana; University of Namibia; Eduardo Mondelane University in Mozambique and Agostinho Neto University, Angola. In Asia the tours are being conducted with Maharashtra University, India and University of Indonesia. #MerckDiabetesTips In addition to building capacity among healthcare professionals to provide quality diabetes care, Merck runs a social media campaign providing diabetes patient education through videos and information materials in English, French, Portuguese, Spanish, and many local languages focusing on diabetes early symptoms and complications to raise awareness on diabetes and the importance of early detection and prevention among communities. To Know More about Merck Diabetes Award: Read below Meet the winners of Merck Diabetes Award 2016 from African and Asian universities: Elisha Kipkemoi Ngetich College of Health Sciences, University of Nairobi, Kenya “I am ecstatic at winning the Merck Diabetes Award 2016. I thank Merck for providing this wonderful platform where students can further their studies in non-communicable diseases. With the current surge in the prevalence of diabetes in Kenya and other developing countries, the timing of this award could not have been better. Over the years, I have developed an interest in diabetes because I have seen patients in the different stages of this disease. I have also seen the impact that early recognition and management of this disease can have and I am privileged to broaden my understanding of the disease through this postgraduate diploma course. This will also build me academically and professionally as well. This is the kind of initiative that Kenya and Africa at large needs, an initiative to empower young doctors and other healthcare professionals. This information then trickles down to the patients and ultimately we end up with a healthy Kenya and Africa. I am convinced that the knowledge I will gather during this experience will significantly impact on my practice in the near future and hence a better outcome for our diabetic patients.” Ralph Obure College of Health Sciences, University of Nairobi, Kenya “The Kenyan healthcare system faces new challenges in diabetes and other non-communicable diseases and so efforts by Merck to increase capacity are timely and highly welcome. I am honoured to receive the Merck Diabetes Award that will advance my medical career and enable me to provide the much needed expertise in diabetes management in Kenya.” Antara Bagchi Indira Gandhi Government Medical College, Nagpur, India “Merck is providing an opportunity for the care and control of diabetes in the community especially in Asia and Africa, where non-communicable diseases are becoming increasingly prevalent. The Merck Capacity Advancement Programme is a ground-breaking initiative to control this rampant and growing epidemic of NCDs like diabetes, by motivating and sensitising undergraduate students like us, and giving them a chance to gain an in-depth, holistic knowledge about every aspect of this disease. I am sure that this initiative will have a profound impact on the health scenario, and the incidence and morbidity of NCDs will be lowered significantly.”   Samuel Mucheru Aga Khan University, Kenya “This award is important to me because it marks the start of a future career in diabetes management which I am very passionate about. It will help build diabetes expertise in my country, which is badly needed due to the exponential increase in diabetes cases within the population. Moreover, it will help achieve the wider goal of building capacity in diabetes management especially in the low and middle income countries whose non-communicable disease burden is on an upward trend without a commensurate increase in the number of experts to deal with this pandemic.” Tinka George Makerere University College of Health Sciences, Uganda “I am grateful and happy that Merck has provided us with this great opportunity to advance our knowledge in diabetes. This opportunity of increasing the number of diabetes specialists will step up efforts in the fight against this 'silent killer', especially here in Africa where the burden of the disease is skyrocketing day and night. This will help save many lives.” Gloria Ani-asamoah Accra, Ghana “It is a privilege to acquire current knowledge in the management of diabetes. It is my hope that at the end of this course l will be a better advocate in diabetes prevention and offer comprehensive diabetes care. The time is now to curb the menace of disease.” Nujood Al Shirawi Intern, Dubai Health Authority, United Arab Emirates “Diabetes is a lifelong illness which affects the lives of more than 14% adults in UAE. With such a high percentage, everybody in the UAE knows individuals battling diabetes. I am grateful to Merck and Dubai Medical College for enabling the young doctors in the region to participate in such a program where a platform has been created for exchange of knowledge between national and international experts. I am looking forward to the diabetes diploma and believe it will add to my existing knowledge and help develop my understanding of this illness which affects nearly every organ in the body. It was a wonderful experience to be part of this award and I would encourage all my colleagues to participate in any future events.” Najmah Kuddah General Practitioner, University of Indonesia, Indonesia “Indonesia is the fifth largest population with diabetes, yet 73.7% is undiagnosed because of lack of awareness. One of them could be someone we love. This award means everything to me, so I can do something for my family, people and my country”. Dominic Oduro-Donkor Cape Coast Teaching Hospital, Ghana “In Ghana many people do not have access to healthcare services in order to identify, diagnose and treat diabetes and its complications. It is essential to achieve adequate diabetes care as the number of people living with the condition continues to escalate. There is also a need to commit resources to diabetes education across Ghana and the African continent at large. Until this happens large numbers of people will end up experiencing potentially preventable diabetes-related complications such as blindness, kidney failure and amputation. The reason why this award is important to me is because Merck has given me an opportunity to take my trade outside the consulting room and making it possible for me to help more people, to make my voice louder and to help those who can’t help themselves. Access to diabetic care in Africa will slowly grow with the initiation of this award, because it will create ‘diabetes scholars’ who will have more insight and knowledge on the best care needed for patients and how to facilitate it. Together, our voices will resonate the need for change and improved management strategies, which will change the face of diabetes care in Africa. The mobilization of professionals across the continent of Africa is the first step in forming a platform where ideas can be put across and shared to make diabetic care easily accessible.”   Ken Munene Nkonge University of Nairobi, Kenya “Similar to other countries in Africa, majority of people living with diabetes in Kenya are diagnosed late, when the options available for preventing complications of the disease are few and suboptimal. I strongly believe that community-based preventative measures alongside early diagnosis and management of prediabetes and related comorbidities such as obesity and hypertension are essential to reducing the burden of type 2 diabetes on Kenya’s health care system. The Merck Diabetes Award is important to me because it will empower me with the knowledge and skills needed to make this belief a reality across Kenya. As the recipient of this award, I look forward to this amazing opportunity.” Watch the below videos of diabetes patients from India, Indonesia and Africa sharing their experience with diabetes Watch Bhupendra Jaiswal, a diabetes patient in India as he talks about his experience: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON5q7i9pDlk Watch Suresh Varpe, a diabetes patient in India as he talks about his experience: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON5q7i9pDlk Watch Ibu Omik, an Indonesian diabetes patient as she shares her experience: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKSuclTCLcM      Watch Tego Wagimin, an Indonesian diabetes patient as he talks about his experience: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eBmGHfYnyI    Watch the experience of Zena Ali, a woman living with diabetes in Kibera, Kenya: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sucYtW5BVc Watch the below Diabetes Patient Awareness Videos #MerckDiabetesTips symptoms and complication in English, French, Portuguese, and local languages Watch Merck Africa-diabetes detection and prevention patient education tips in English: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeTip7eI30A   Merck Capacity Advancement Program-diabetes detection and prevention patient education tips in French: https://youtu.be/ecgC-xlZn90 Merck Capacity Advancement Program-diabetes detection & prevention patient education tips in Portuguese: https://youtu.be/nAyvXTTQIx0 Watch Merck India diabetes detection and prevention patient education tips in Hindi: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRDELKUjpac Watch Merck India diabetes detection and prevention patient education tips in Marathi: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4H7Z__LYlE Watch Merck Indonesia diabetes detection and prevention patient education tips in Bahasa: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3pC-64h-Xo Watch Merck Africa diabetes detection and prevention patient education tips in Kiswahili: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isi5ThqhNt8 Watch medical students’ testimonies about Merck Capacity Advancement Program and Merck Diabetes Award from United Arab Emirates, India and Africa Watch medical students at the Dubai Medical University as they share their ideas on how to improve diabetes awareness in United Arab Emirates to apply for Merck Diabetes Award: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFRcSEC6fRU Watch testimonies of Medical Students from India on the benefits of Merck Capacity Advancement Program: https://youtu.be/SvIF_JetKO4   Watch testimonies of students from the University of Nairobi, Kenya on the benefits of the Merck Capacity Advancement Program: http://youtu.be/JZVJwmtr7ng  Distributed by APO on behalf of Merck.

Vioxx, made by Merck, and Celebrex, made by Pfizer, could quell pain and inflammation just as well as drugs such as ibuprofen and naproxen, but they did not cause ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding. But then, the shocker. A Merck clinical trial asking if Vioxx could also prevent colon cancer revealed that the drug increased the risk of heart attacks, and the company pulled it off the market in 2004. Ever since, a question has hung over Celebrex. Did it cause heart attacks, too? A decade ago, the Food and Drug Administration asked Pfizer to find out. Now, at long last, the resulting clinical trial is done. Most medical researchers, including the study’s principal investigator, thought Celebrex would be riskier than either ibuprofen or naproxen. Instead, it was at least no worse and may even be safer than the alternatives. “This is definitely a striking finding,” said Dr. Michael Lauer, a cardiologist at the National Institutes of Health who was not associated with the study. An estimated 2 million people in the United States take Celebrex or generic celecoxib, said Dr. Milton Pressler, a cardiologist in charge of clinical affairs for Pfizer Essential Health. The drug is available only by prescription; as the trial dragged on, its patent expired, so now generic companies also sell it. The study involved 24,000 people with arthritis who were at high risk for heart disease or already had it. A third of them were randomly assigned to take Celebrex, a third to take naproxen and a third to take ibuprofen. The doses were equivalent and neither the participants nor the investigators knew who was taking what. The results were published Sunday online in the New England Journal of Medicine to coincide with a presentation at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association by Dr. Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic, who directed the new study. He and others emphasized that the findings only apply to people taking the drugs every day for months or years and who are at high risk for heart disease or already have it. They do not apply to someone who pops an occasional ibuprofen such as Advil for a pulled muscle or takes a naproxen such as Aleve for a headache. When the trial was designed, many thought, based on data from small studies, that naproxen was safest and celecoxib was likely to be the most risky. In fact, said Susan Ellenberg, a biostatistician at the University of Pennsylvania, some at the FDA wanted to label naproxen as being safest. But an advisory committee that met in 2015 said to wait for the results of the new trial and warned that none of the drugs were risk-free. The FDA declined to comment on the outcome of the study. Dr. Michael Joseph Blaha, director of clinical research for the Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease, said many of his heart patients also have arthritis. “This is a common question that people have: Is it safe to take these drugs?” said Dr. Blaha, who was not associated with the new study. The main purpose of the study was to investigate “noninferiority” — to see if celecoxib was at least as safe as the other two drugs. It was. Yet major questions remain, said Dr. Peter W.F. Wilson, of the Emory Clinical Cardiovascular Research Institute. There was no placebo, which made it hard to pick up an increase in heart risk if it occurs with all the drugs. Pfizer is now “sifting through more than 3 million pages of data and putting together a comprehensive report” to send to the FDA, Dr. Pressler said. Then, he said, it will be up to the agency to decide what changes, if any, should be made to the drug’s label, which currently warns against heart and gastrointestinal effects. The study found that, during the trial, 188 of the celecoxib patients (2.3 percent) died of heart disease or hemorrhage, or had a heart attack or a stroke, compared with 201 patients taking naproxen (2.5 percent) and 218 patients (2.7 percent) taking ibuprofen. The real surprise was in other outcomes the study investigated. Significantly more patients taking ibuprofen had worsening kidney function. Patients taking either ibuprofen or naproxen were significantly more likely to be hospitalized for high blood pressure. And despite the assumption that naproxen was the safest, there were 25 percent more total deaths with naproxen than celecoxib — 163 with naproxen compared with 132 with celecoxib. As expected, because celecoxib was intended to avoid bleeding problems, both ibuprofen and naproxen patients had significantly more gastrointestinal bleeding and ulcers. These other outcomes were not the primary focus of the study and could not be considered proof of harm, though did warrant further study, Dr. Nissen emphasized. Dr. Wilson took issue with stressing the secondary outcomes. The rules of clinical trial research say what counts is the outcome you designed your study to find. “To then drill into secondary endpoints and find superiority — that’s not really fair,” he said. Pfizer paid for the study — one of the largest it has ever done, Dr. Pressler said — but to avoid conflicts of interest, members of the study’s executive committee, who all were academic researchers, agreed to not accept payments from any maker of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the duration of the trial. The study did have some real weaknesses, said Dr. Elliott M. Antman, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a past president of the American Heart Association. Only a minority of the patients actually had documented heart disease, and it is those patients who are most worrisome. Many dropped out, making it hard to interpret the data. “They asked an important question, but the trial was hard to complete,” he said. The weaknesses of the study made him unable to be confident of its conclusions. Still, he said, “this is the best we will get,” adding “we will probably never see another study like this.” Dr. Antman said he would continue to advise that any of these drugs be taken only by the lowest-risk patients in the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time. Others, like Dr. Blaha, accepted the conclusions. “I would not feel comfortable saying it is perfectly safe to take celecoxib,” he said. “But if you need to take a daily pill, it might be safer to take this one than the other two.” The study, he said, convinced him to change his practice. “On average it looks like celecoxib is safer,” he said. “If you need to be on it for more than a couple of months, I would think strongly about celecoxib.” Sign up for free newsletters and get more of the Post-Gazette delivered to your inbox Most Read Most Emailed Advertisement Most Commented Your e-mail: Your Name: Friends e-mail: Friends Name: Message: Captcha Submit Advertisement Create a free PG account.

The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion for Lusduna (insulin glargine) for the treatment of diabetes mellitus, after it showed comparable quality, safety and efficacy to Lantus. An injected solution, the long-acting insulin analogue lowers high blood glucose by binding to the human insulin receptor to induce the same pharmacological effect as human insulin. Lusduna is now one step closer to European approval, but is facing a patent infringement lawsuit from Sanofi as the company moves to protect its big-selling product. Last year, Sanofi settled another Lantus patent infringement lawsuit with Lilly, after its Lantus 'follow-on' product Abasaglar won FDA approval in December. As part of that deal Lilly agreed to pay royalties to the French pharma group in exchange for a license to certain of its patents, and launched Abasaglar in the UK in August. Forteo biosimilars Meanwhile, the CHMP this month also issued positive opinions for two versions of Lilly's big-selling osteoporosis therapy Forteo (teriparatide). Hungarian pharmaceutical firm Gedeon Richter and Germany's Stada Arzneimittel received recommendations for Terrosa and Movymia respectively, for the treatment of postmenopausal women and men at increased risk of fracture. Both biosimilars are administered as an injected solution to increase bone mineral density in the lumbar spine and hip as well as reduce the risk of vertebral and non-vertebral fractures. Lilly's Forteo brought in $1.35bn in sales last year but its dominant position in the osteoporosis market has been increasingly under threat with the advent of biosimilar and generic competition. Furthermore, Amgen and UCB's rival osteoporosis drug romosozumab has demonstrated superior results to Forteo in phase III trials, and analysts have suggested the emerging anti-sclerostin antibody class will bring in well above $1bn in sales in the coming years.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Lenny Bernstein November 13 Follow @LennyMBernstein (iStock) In 2004, when drugmaker Merck voluntarily pulled the pain-reliever Vioxx off the market amid evidence that it increased the risk of heart attacks, concern naturally turned to its nearly identical rival, Celebrex. The medication works the same way, by inhibiting production of an enzyme that causes pain and inflammation — as do naproxen, ibuprofen and others in the class of widely used analgesics known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). Now the first large-scale study of the three drugs finds that Celebrex poses no greater risk of heart attack, stroke, other cardiovascular problems or death than naproxen or ibuprofen. More surprisingly, says Steven E. Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic, who led the nearly decade-long international research, there is evidence that Celebrex is less likely than the other two to cause  kidney and gastrointestinal problems associated with NSAIDS. “Do I think there’s a difference between these three drugs?” Nissen asked. “The answer is yes.” [How drugs intended for legitimate pain patients found their way to the black market] That statement may be more controversial than it sounds, because so many people take NSAIDS by prescription and via over-the-counter products such as Advil and Motrin. “Everyone on the planet takes these drugs,” he said. In the United States, about 70 percent of people ages 65 and older take NSAIDS once a week, with half of them taking at least seven doses each week, according to a 2013 study in the American Journal of Managed Care. More than 100 million prescriptions are written for the drugs each year in this country. But Nissen and other experts were quick to point out that the new findings are not easily applied to people using over-the-counter pain relief. The more than 24,000 participants in the study all had painful arthritis and elevated risk for cardiovascular problems. More importantly, they were given significantly higher doses of the three drugs than are found in over-the-counter versions. Nevertheless, the results may cause some people to reconsider NSAID pain relievers, especially those who take them frequently and in doses larger than the amounts recommended in over-the-counter formulations, Nissen said. [Pfizer agrees to truth in opioid marketing] “If you have pain that is sufficiently severe that you need these drugs to function, you should weigh the benefits of relieving pain versus the potential hazards,” he said. He and others said that users should take the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible time to avoid side effects. The study had a number of shortcomings. More than 27 percent of the participants left the trial before researchers could determine whether they had suffered any side effect, and more than 68 percent at some point discontinued their use of celecoxib, the generic version of Celebrex that was tested. Both developments are to be expected in research that involves people in pain, but the proportions are very large, said Colin Baigent, director of the Medical Research Council population health research unit at England’s Oxford University. In addition, Baigent said, the daily 200-milligram dose of celecoxib given to participants because of some countries’ health regulations is lower than the amount many people in other studies have received — which would tend to limit cardiovascular side effects. Previous research has shown that complications increase along with dosage, he said. [I had a big pain in the neck. Then I ate a bunch of tart cherries] Yet Baigent and Carlo Patrono, a professor of pharmacology at the Catholic University School of Medicine in Rome, said the study confirms conclusions they reached in an analysis of previous research and adds some significant new data. “It does not provide any surprises,” Patrono said. The study, which was mandated by the Food and Drug Administration after Vioxx’s withdrawal, was released Sunday at a meeting of the American Heart Association and in the New England Journal of Medicine. It was funded by Pfizer, which makes Celebrex and other NSAIDs, but numerous precautions were taken to preserve the researchers’ independence, Nissen said. An FDA spokeswoman said the agency would not comment on the results. Milton Pressler, vice president and head of clinical affairs for Pfizer, said the company is “pleased to have these results after many years” of waiting for the trial to conclude. The company also makes the Advil brand of over-the-counter ibuprofen, but Pressler said the results cannot be applied to that product because of the study’s much higher doses of ibuprofen, which were given for an average of 20 months. Similarly, Johnson & Johnson, which makes Motrin, said in a statement that “the study evaluated ibuprofen at doses and duration greater than the over-the-counter Motrin products sold in the U.S. … Consumers should always read and follow the label and talk to their health care professional if they have questions or health concerns.” The research looked at 24,081 people with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis at 926 medical centers in 13 countries between 2006 and 2014. About a third were given 100 milligrams of celecoxib twice a day, a third took 600 milligrams of ibuprofen three times a day and the rest took 375 milligrams of naproxen twice a day. Some patients with rheumatoid arthritis received higher doses. All had risks such as previous heart attacks or diabetes. Patients on celecoxib fared no worse than those taking naproxen or ibuprofen when most cardiovascular complications were tallied. And they suffered significantly fewer serious kidney problems and hospitalizations for hypertension than those taking ibuprofen. They also experienced fewer gastrointestinal complications than patients in the other two groups. national health-science to-your-health Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

"Following" : "Follow"}} November 14, 2016 4:57pm   Comments Share: Related GILD Several Key Catalysts Lay Ahead For Gilead Sciences In The Next Year Benzinga's Top Initiations FDA Approves Gilead's Next Generation HBV Treatment (Seeking Alpha) Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: GILD) recently reported a Q3 EPS miss, driven by lower than expected sales of its hepatitis C drugs Harvoni and Sovaldi. The poor performance may have been in response to increasing competition from companies like AbbVie Inc (NYSE: ABBV) and Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK), as well as pricing pressure. However, spending on Harvoni remains quite high. In fact, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) revealed that the drug with the highest total spending in Medicaid in 2015 was Harvoni. Source: CMS To shed some light on the issue, Benzinga contacted Gilead. “Gilead’s HCV therapies are medical breakthroughs that offer a cure to the vast majority of patients suffering from hepatitis C, a life threatening and debilitating disease,” the company stated. Harvoni and Sovaldi not only save lives, but also “provide long-term value and cost savings to the healthcare system as a whole,” they added, noting that one-time cost of Harvoni and Sovaldi is substantially lower than the costs associated with treating HCV for a lifetime. “Most payers receive substantial discounts off the list price, with the steepest discounts going to payers like Medicaid and the VA. Both the VA and Medicaid currently receive discounts in excess of 50% on Harvoni,” a statment from the companty concluded.

The industry also scored big in beating back the much-watched California ballot measure to cap prices on drugs for some state health programs. Story Continued Below It appears that Trump’s sights are set on repealing (or “amending”) Obamacare — not tangling with drug makers. The latest refresh of his health care policy web page includes no mention of the Medicare negotiations he occasionally talked about on the trail. In fact, it doesn’t mention drug costs at all, but it does pledge reform of the FDA “to put greater focus on the needs of patients for new and innovative medical products.” And there’s a must-pass vehicle coming next year for just that: the user fee reauthorization, which is also now seen as the likely home for many of the policies baked into 21st Century Cures. The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index has shot up about 10 percent since the election. Analysts note other benefits to the broader medical products sector, such as the two-year delay of the medical device tax through 2017, which is now likely to become permanent as part of the Obamacare repeal effort. BUT THE DRUG PRICE ISSUE IS NOT GOING AWAY — Recent polls show it’s still the top health care priority for voters. Pharma lobbyists see the likely policy response as much less threatening, especially in D.C., but they don’t expect the issue to vanish. “It’s going to continue to be a work stream on the Hill, but we’re not going to create an independent review board [on drug pricing], we’re not going to give [the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review] super powers,” a veteran GOP lobbyist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “All of those things that were going to be new and extremely aggressive aren’t going to happen.” Ian Spatz, former top lobbyist at Merck and now a drug industry consultant at Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLP, said the industry’s initial reaction to the election was “shock and surprise” and “caused everyone to go back to the drawing board and figure out what the strategy is.” Drug costs are “an important pocketbook issue for voters” and it’s not going away, he said. He expects states will likely be the “focus of action.” Politics aside, the pressure on prices will continue. GlaxoSmithKline’s CEO, Andrew Witty, said on the eve of the election that broader trends in the market, including insurer and hospital consolidation and efforts to expand value-based payment models, will continue to push prices down regardless of who wins. Obamacare repeal isn’t great for pharma, either. Despite the previous GOP repeal bill using reconciliation to roll back ACA taxes on the industry — an overall positive for pharma expected to appear again in future repeal efforts — drug companies are selling prescriptions to more than 20 million people who are insured under Obamacare, either through Medicaid expansion or the exchange plans. Happy Monday and welcome to the first Prescription PULSE of the Trump era. Here we go, folks. Send concerns, tips and transition news to bnorman@politico.com (@BrettNorman) and skarlin@politico.com (@SarahKarlin). TRANSITION UPDATE: CHRISTIE DEMOTED, ALONG WITH BAGGER — The Trump transition announced Friday that Vice President-elect, Mike Pence, would take charge of the D.C.-based transition team, with Rick Dearborn, a top policy adviser, running day-to-day. Pence replaces New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. And, Rich Bagger — the former Celgene and Pfizer executive and Christie loyalist — was downgraded from the No. 2 transition team official to a “transition adviser.” Bagger’s name had previously circulated as a possible Trump health care appointee. Read the announcement here. Note to Pros getting up to speed on the transition: Andrew Bremberg is overseeing the HHS transition and Jim Frogue advised the Trump campaign on health care issues out of Trump Tower. WHAT THE ELECTION MEANS FOR CURES — Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and House Speaker Paul Ryan, both said last week that 21st Century Cures would be a top priority for the lame duck. House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman, Fred Upton, was even spreading the word after the election that he aimed to bring a bill to the House floor this week. … But a number of Hill aides and Cures watchers who spoke to us seriously doubt it will get done this year. First, Republican and Democratic staff negotiators were still wrestling with the core problem that has dogged the effort all along: how to pay for it. The most recent package under negotiation would include about $4 billion in NIH funding, and additional money for a response to the opioid epidemic and the White House’s Cancer Moonshot Initiative. Second, Republicans continue to insist on including the REGROW Act — cited by McConnell as his top priority. The legislation would undermine FDA’s standards of approval for regenerative medicine treatments in an effort to speed them to market. It may well be a deal-breaker, as FDA and Democrats are flatly opposed. Third, there are Republicans in the House who have no interest in giving the Obama administration an outgoing legacy gift of helping the moonshot get off the ground. And perhaps most importantly, lobbyists on both sides of the aisle said a deal in the lame duck session was unlikely because there’s nothing so urgent in Cures that Republicans couldn’t wait to get it done as part of the user fee bill next year, when they will control the White House. NIH funding stays flat for now. Congress is widely expected to pass a short-term funding bill that keeps government funding flat into March. That would at least defer an expected bipartisan boost to NIH’s budget. TPP is a goner. With Trump’s election, the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal is off the table — likely for good. That puts an end to pharma’s fight to push for stronger biologic marketing exclusivity protections in the deal. It’s not clear that’s a win for the industry overall, however. Drug companies generally support and benefit from free trade and open borders, and the deal would have provided a host of protections in some markets that currently have none. Whither the Part B demo? CMS is still expected to finalize its controversial experiment in how to pay for drugs administered at doctors’ offices and hospitals under Medicare Part B. Whether it will ever take effect is another question. The proposed pilot drew fire from Republicans and Democrats, and any program finalized now could be rolled back or changed by a Trump administration using the Congressional Review Act. … CMS Acting Administrator, Andy Slavitt, said last week that one of his top priorities in his final days at the agency is protecting CMMI. However, putting the demonstration front and center could draw more unfavorable GOP attention and risk placing CMMI in their Obamacare repeal push next year. But there’s bipartisan consensus behind nudging the system to pay for value and broad authority for what the center can do. That makes it an attractive tool for the party in power — think a Medicare premium support demonstration, or perhaps even Medicaid block grants (though there's debate about whether CMMI could actually do that … ). More in Pro Health’s outlook for the lame duck. ** A message from The Biologics Prescribers Collaborative (BPC): Meaningful suffixes are important in medicine.

Physician groups call for biosimilar names that are easily distinguished and recognized. Learn more from http://biologicsprescribers.org ** FDA STILL LEARY OF OFF-LABEL PROMOTION — Anyone thinking the FDA is going to open the flood gates on drug industry promotion should listen to Commissioner Robert Califf’s opening remarks at last week’s two-day public hearing, which sound like a strong argument for the status quo. He outlined the agency’s renewed commitment to examining its off-label communication policies following key court cases that pushed back on the government’s ability to regulate and prosecute truthful speech. Califf started by ticking off stark reminders of why the framework was put in place by lawmakers in the first place — there have been tragic public health consequences when drug companies have been allowed to sell medicines without strong evidence of their safety and effectiveness. He also cited a study from earlier this year that found that drugs put into practice for unapproved uses are associated with a substantial increase in adverse events. And he took a jab at industry’s track record on promotion. “Historically, there are many examples in which the medical products industry has promoted either false or misleading information about their products to persuade doctors to use therapies inappropriately,” he said. Califf acknowledged there can be times when truthful scientific and medical information regarding a product’s unapproved use may help health care providers make better decisions for individual patients. However, he added that providers already have considerable access to off-label data. The burden for drug and device companies seems to be whether they can prove to the FDA that they have information doctors are otherwise having trouble getting. Of course, there is an all-important caveat here: the meeting occurred in the wake of the election. Given Trump’s victory, all of Califf’s points could now be moot. However, if there’s any area of the science-based FDA that could be affected by the political ideology of the Trump administration, it’s drug industry promotion. We’re guessing that whoever Trump picks to lead HHS, the Justice Department and FDA, is unlikely to see eye-to-eye with current leadership on this issue. Can the rank and file scientists at the FDA keep industry promotion in check? MORE RX PRICING INVESTIGATIONS — Buried in the chaos of election night, was an announcement by ARIAD Pharmaceuticals that it received a subpoena in early November from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts. The company must hand over documents related to its support of charities that provide financial assistance to Medicare patients and ARIAD patient support programs. Drug companies can risk kick-back violations when providing co-pay or discount support to Medicare patients. Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Elijah Cummings questioned the $80,000 increase in the price of ARIAD’s leukemia drug over the past five years in an October letter to the company. … Valeant also announced last week that it received a subpoena from the California Department of Insurance over its ties to pharmacies and marketing practices, Reuters reports. The company has received so much bad press for its high drug prices, it’s now considering changing its name, board member William Ackman told CNBC the same day. NEW HHS OIG WORK PLAN TACKLES DRUG COSTS — The Office of Inspector General 2017 work plan will look at the amount of money the government could collect if it implemented inflation-based rebates in Medicare Part B. OIG will also study the waste that occurs because of the size of drug vials sold in the U.S. Savings might be achieved if the vial sizes available in other countries — which tend to be smaller — were offered in the U.S., and if drug companies then marketed those smaller vials at lower prices. HHS is going to look at how much money it spends on drugs that end up being wasted due to large vial size. Other new drug studies on the agenda: — whether the government could save money if companies were required to pay rebates to Medicare Part D on prescriptions filled at 340B participating pharmacies. — questionable billing for compounded topical drugs in Part D. — Part D payments made for patients after their death INDUSTRY: VALUE-BASED DRUG PRICING WON’T WORK FOR ALL MEDS — Pay-for-value and pay-for-outcomes have both been pharma industry refrains in response to criticism on drug pricing. The idea is to charge different prices for medicines based on how well they work in specific patients, or tie prices to offsets in the cost of patient care down the line. But comments from Roche pricing head Jens Grueger to Reuters shows the industry is starting to walk back some of the hype. Grueger said that while flexible pricing models have worked well for cancer drugs abroad (his company often charges differently depending on the specific type cancer the product treats), it isn’t as likely to be implemented for other treatments, such as Roche’s forthcoming multiple sclerosis medicine, Ocrevus. There is no data available that would allow the company to create varied pricing for patients with different forms of the highly variable disease. Novartis’s CEO, Joe Jimenez, has also pointed out the limitations of these new pricing models. FDA FINALIZES RULE ON CITIZEN PETITIONS — The agency issued a final rule outlining how it will implement a 2007 law designed to ensure that drug companies don’t improperly use citizen petitions to delay approval of competing products. The rule outlines how these petitions, which if granted could delay approval of a pending generic drug application, must be submitted to the agency. The final rule also includes changes made to the law in 2012 that apply to biosimilars and shorten the time period FDA has to review the petitions from 180 days to 150 days. Still, FDA has said it remains concerned about the number of petitions it receives that are intended primarily to delay the agency’s approval of a competing drug product, and that don’t raise valid scientific or public health issues. QUICK HITS TAX HOLIDAY — A Donald Trump White House could be pharma’s golden ticket for a tax holiday, or perhaps a tax overhaul, worth billions. Analysts estimate that biopharma companies could have as much as $98 billion parked overseas, and bringing this money back home could mean an uptick in M&A, share repurchase programs and paying down debt. More from BioPharmaDive. TWITTER ADS — The FDA requests comments on a research study testing the effectiveness of drug advertising on Twitter. It wants to see whether consumers will read and understand safety information if they have to click on a link and go to a second webpage to view those warnings. NOT ENOUGH — The FDA has done little to stop the opioid epidemic, and has impeded pharma's ability to get products that treat substance-use disorders to the market, experts said at a workshop convened by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. They suggest the agency consider restricting the marketing and promotion of opioids, and call for better labeling to quantify their efficacy, MedPageToday reports. THORNY QUESTIONS — Johnson & Johnson’s unique approach to handling “compassionate use” requests for access to its experimental anti-cancer drug, daratumumab, raised hope but also questions on ethics and clinical trials. More from STAT on how this novel process may be replicated with other drugs. FDA/CMS LEADERSHIP LIKE ‘PRECISION,’ NOT ‘PERSONALIZED’ MEDICINE — Leadership at both agencies outline in JAMA how they are working together to bridge the gap between FDA’s approval of a product and CMS’s coverage determinations, including how they are adapting to evaluate both evidence generated through clinical trials and data from other sources. One interesting point: They take issue with use of the phrase “personalized medicine,” and warn of over-promising on the potential to customize therapies for individual patients without broader scientific data. “The FDA and CMS are concerned that this term could be misconstrued as implying that science will enable individual practitioners to accurately predict what will happen to patients without reference to a larger base of empirical evidence gathered from broader groups.” Their plea: Call it precision medicine. PFIZER LOWERS VACCINE PRICE IN CRISIS AREAS — The pharma giant announced Friday it will offer the lowest price on its pneumonia vaccine to humanitarian organizations working in emergency areas. The lowest price is now $3.10 per dose. Read the announcement here. PEOPLE Peter Stein will serve as deputy director of FDA’s new drugs office. Stein was most recently the vice president of late stage development, diabetes and endocrinology at Merck. CATCHING OUR ATTENTION: IS IT TOO SOON FOR A DRUG INDUSTRY CELEBRATION? While a GOP White House emboldened by a Republican-controlled Congress may mean less drug price regulation, Trump’s criticism of the industry and its lobby indicate that it’s too early to tell whether his victory is good news for the biopharmaceutical industry — so buckle up, Bloomberg reports. “Expecting doctrinaire Republican drug policy from a man who ran anything but a doctrinaire Republican campaign is risky,” Max Nisen writes. Trump’s win prompted a brief rally for drug companies in the stock market, but the future of the industry remains as uncertain as the details of Trump’s health care policies. Beyond health care, his trade and economic policies could create difficulty for companies that conduct lot of international business, and his anti-immigrant proposals could hamper an industry that employs many overseas workers. ** A message from The Biologics Prescribers Collaborative (BPC): Meaningful suffixes are important in medicine.

The biggest problem is that he has not fleshed out the slogans, threats and vague promises made during his campaign. Winners The pharmaceutical industry should be happy Hillary Clinton is not heading for the White House given that she had promised to crack down on what she called “excessive price increases”. The shares of firms like Pfizer and Merck rallied in relief. Tech firms like Apple, Microsoft and Google owner Alphabet have kept billions of dollars of profits out of the US rather than pay the current 39 percent corporation tax. Trump has proposed a one-off 10 percent rate for repatriated cash. Fossil fuel firms could benefit given the president elect has said global warming is “a hoax”. So might mining companies, steel manufacturers and builders from his infrastructure spending promises. Losers The likely losers include renewable energy companies as the Trump victory threatens to reverse US energy and environmental priorities. He has also pledged to pull the US out of the Paris agreement to cut emissions and fight climate changes. Share of Danish firm Vestas, the world’s second-largest wind turbine producer, fell along with those of Spain’s Gamesa and Germany company Siemens. US carmakers who have plants in Mexico to take advantage of lower labour costs would lose out from Trump’s threats to impose tariffs on vehicles shipped north. Toyota, Nissan and Volkswagen would also be hit as they too have factories south of the border. Oil drillers. Gas pipelines. Coal. The defense industry. These are the likely winners of a Trump administration. https://t.co/Zd7lay5sYX— nzherald Business (@nzheraldbiz) November 10, 2016 Read my FX op-ed FX Winners & Losers after a Trump victory on CNBC https://t.co/CbNJz5rHNb .CNBC</a> .<a href="https://twitter.com/business">business GlobalFX</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/fx?src=hash">#fx</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/fxtrading?src=hash">#fxtrading</a></p>&mdash; Keith Underwood (Underwood_FX) November 9, 2016 Share this article: More about: Business Google Donald Trump Elections USA presidential elections 2016 All views Get a different perspective Every story can be told in many ways: see the perspectives from Euronews journalists in our other language teams.

(Photo : Getty Images/Rick Friedman) Share This Tweet This A new study gives some relief to arthritis patients who want pain relief but are worried about its side effect.The study of arthritis drugs found that Pfizer Inc.'s painkiller Celebrex  posed no higher risk to a patient's heart than some other prescription pain pills that are much together on the stomach. According to two different analyses on 24,000- patient study, patients assigned to take Celebrex suffered numerically fewer heart-related problem, heart attacks, and strokes than naproxen and ibuprofen. Dr. Michael Lauer, a cardiologist at the National Institute of Health said it a very 'striking finding' Advertisement The drugs seemed miraculous when they were first introduced in 1999. But due to the allegation from Merck clinical trial that the drug increased the risk of heart diseases, and the company pulled it off the market in 2004, reported by The State. The researchers during the trial 188 of the celecoxib patients (2.3 percent) died of heart disease or had a heart attack, compared with 201 patients taking naproxen and 218 patients taking ibuprofen. The patients taking ibuprofen had worsening kidney function, increased high blood pressure and had significantly more gastrointestinal bleeding and ulcers. According to New York Times, there were 25 percent more total deaths with naproxen than celecoxib- 163 with naproxen compared with 132 with celecoxib. And the celecoxib was intended to avoid bleeding problems as well. The other outcome of the study could not consider proof of harm, though they did warrant of further study, emphasized by Dr. Steven Nissen, who directed the study of Cleveland Clinic. Advertisement "Celecoxib is safer. If you need to be on it for more than a couple of months. I would think strongly about celecoxib", reported by Dr. Blaha  The study has some real weaknesses, said by Dr. Elliott M. Antman. He argued that minority of patients had documented heart disease who are most worrisome.Making it hard to interpret the real data.     SEE ALSO Larger "supermoon" to loom over skies on November 14 Chocolates galore!

The findings challenge the common belief that the rival drugs provide superior cardiovascular health safety, researchers said.  ( Tim Boyle | Getty Images ) Advertisement After 10 years of research, scientists have affirmed the heart safety of Pfizer Inc.'s arthritis drug Celebrex (celecoxib), providing evidence that it is no more likely to cause stroke or heart attacks than its rivals. The arthritis drugs Celebrex, Ibuprofen and Naproxen are part of a group of painkillers known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). All pain killers work by preventing the production of the enzyme that triggers inflammation. In 2004, concerns toward the safety of Celebrex for the heart emerged when another pain killer named Vioxx was pulled off the market by pharmaceutical company Merck. Back then, evidence suggested that Vioxx had increased the likelihood of heart attacks among patients with arthritis. Safe For Heart Health Now, a large-scale study discovered that Celebrex does not pose higher risk of stroke, heart attack or other cardiovascular problems compared to Ibuprofen and Naproxen. Dr. Steven Nissen, lead researcher of the report and a cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic, said findings indicate that Celebrex is less likely to cause side effects such as gastrointestinal or kidney problems than its rivals. The 10-year clinical trial involved around 24,000 patients who took Celebrex, Ibuprofen or Naproxen for 20 months on average, and were followed for the next 14 months. All arthritis patients either had existing cardiovascular disease or were at greater risk. About a third of the participants were given 100 milligrams of Celebrex twice per day, a third received 600 milligrams of ibuprofen thrice a day, and the rest received 375 milligrams of naproxen twice per day. Nissen and his colleagues affirmed that those on Celebrex fared no worse than those on naproxen and ibuprofen when heart disease complications are considered. "These findings challenge the widely held view that naproxen provides superior cardiovascular safety," said Nissen. Limitations Of The Study The results of the research may help patients reconsider their NSAID pain relievers, particularly for those who take arthritis drugs more frequently and in larger doses, authors of the study said. Nissen advised arthritis patients with severe pain to weigh the benefits of pain relievers versus the potential hazards. He said users should take the lowest possible dosage to avoid side effects. "Everyone on the planet takes these drugs," said Nissen. In fact, at least 70 percent of elderly in the United States take NSAIDS once a week. Meanwhile, the research does contain several limitations. For instance, about 27 percent of patients left the trial before it was determined whether they experienced side effects, and another 68 percent discontinued the use of Celebrex. Additionally, the dose of Celebrex given to patients because of countries' regulations is lower than the amount that patients in other studies have received. Past studies have shown the cardiovascular complications increase along with the dosage. Details of the report are published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images Julia Kollewe Monday 14 November 2016 04.35 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger GlaxoSmithKline has come top of a league table that monitors the availability of medicine in developing countries, with fellow UK drugmaker AstraZeneca making it into the top 10. The non-profit Access to Medicine foundation, which compiles the biennial index of drug companies, warned that while the availability of medicines is improving, the industry needs to do more on affordable pricing and the fight against corruption. Jayasree Iyer, executive director of the foundation, said: “Now is the time to step up those efforts.” Overall, drugmakers have 850 products on the market for the 51 worst diseases in low and middle-income countries. They are developing another 420. But only 5% of products are covered by pricing strategies that were deemed affordable for different population groups within countries. Iyer said there was no area where drugmakers had gone backwards, but noted that affordable pricing and misconduct were “static”. Breaches of laws or codes relating to corruption, unethical marketing and anti-competitive behaviour continue to arise. GSK came first in the rankings for the fifth time, followed by Johnson & Johnson of the US, Swiss company Novartis and German group Merck. AstraZeneca jumped from 15th to seventh position after introducing a new affordability-based pricing strategy and expanding its Healthy Heart Africa programme, which aims to treat 10 million people for hypertension, or high blood pressure, over the next decade. The company was in sixth place in 2008 but then fell behind in several areas. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Access to Medicine Index. Photograph: Access to Medicine Foundation GSK accounted for the most research and development projects in areas of great need but with low commercial incentive, followed by AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson. The British drugmaker also topped the index for considering affordability when setting prices. Its top ranking came despite a damaging bribery scandal in China in 2014, for which it was fined £300m. The scandal prompted the company to overhaul its sales practices. Iyer expressed some concern about GSK chief executive Sir Andrew Witty’s departure next March and what it could mean for the company’s efforts. He will be succeeded by Emma Walmsley, who currently runs GSK’s consumer healthcare business. The index assesses the world’s 20 largest pharmaceutical companies on a range of measures, including their willingness to discount prices in poor countries, research on neglected tropical diseases, lobbying, patent policies, breaches of codes of conduct, corruption or bribery, transparency and conduct in clinical trials. The Access to Medicine foundation is funded by the UK and Dutch governments and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It says its framework is used by companies to draw up access to medicine strategies.

The study of arthritis sufferers is likely to raise eyebrows, given long-held concerns about Celebrex. Some 100 million prescriptions were written in the United States in 2013 alone for the type of painkiller known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDS, to which all three drugs belong. Celebrex, or celecoxib, belongs to a class of NSAID called Cox-2 inhibitors that were designed to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding common with many NSAIDs. The primary goal of the 24,000-patient trial was to demonstrate that Celebrex did not cause an increased risk of serious heart problems compared with the other two drugs. The main measures of heart attack, stroke or death occurred between 2 percent and 3 percent of patients for all three medicines, a statistically significant result for non-inferiority. "I think it's incontrovertible that celecoxib is not worse than these older NSAIDS," said Dr. Steven Nissen, the study's lead investigator. U.S. regulators ordered the study after pulling Merck & Co's blockbuster pain drug Vioxx from the market for causing heart attacks and deaths, leading many in the medical community to assume that the entire class of Cox-2 inhibitors was similarly tainted. Merck at one point offered the theory that naproxen, to which Vioxx was compared in studies, protected the heart. "Everybody thought: 'Oh, naproxen is the safest; Celebrex is probably like Vioxx,'" said Nissen, chief of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic, who presented the data at the American Heart Association's scientific meeting in New Orleans. "Everybody thought they knew the answer, and the entire world was wrong." Annual sales of Celebrex, which is now off patent, have declined to about $775 million for Pfizer. The drug is available as a generic from many companies, including Mylan NV and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. Celebrex sales were about $3 billion in 2014 and could have been far higher but for safety concerns. In 2005, U.S. regulators ordered Pfizer to withdraw another Cox-2 pain drug, Bextra, over a host of safety issues and added a safety warning to the Celebrex label. Naproxen is the active ingredient in Bayer AG's Aleve, while ibuprofen is the main component of Pfizer's Advil. The older drugs in the study were taken at higher doses and for far longer than the recommendations for the over-the-counter versions. Researchers stressed that safety issues seen in the study should not lead to conclusions about occasional use of the OTC products. Cardiology researchers also said it was unclear how these results might affect prescribing habits of the primary care doctors who most often treat arthritis patients. Patients in the study took the drugs for 20 months on average and were followed for another 14 months. But 27 percent of those enrolled dropped out. Researchers said many chronic pain patients seek additional or alternative therapy. On some secondary measures of the study, Celebrex actually fared better. Death for any reason was 25 percent higher with naproxen than Celebrex, although that did not quite reach statistical significance, while kidney problems were 64 percent higher with ibuprofen than Celebrex. "I was completely surprised at the excess of renal toxicity with ibuprofen," Nissen said. There was also a significant excess of gastrointestinal problems with ibuprofen and naproxen, such as severe anemia likely due to internal bleeding. Dr. Elliott Antman, a past AHA president who critiqued the study, noted several limitations, including that those taking ibuprofen or naproxen were allowed to increase their dosage but not the Celebrex group. He called for a much more detailed analysis of the data. Dr. Clyde Yancy, another past AHA president who also was not involved in the study, cited a need for better drugs. "Clearly we need an additional therapeutic option for patients who have known cardiovascular disease and a chronic pain syndrome," he said. Available therapies have enough limitations "that we're not where we need to be."

The president-elect has pledged to cut corporation tax for American companies and suggested that he could allow businesses to repatriate money earned overseas back into the US without having to pay hefty fines. “With the Republicans in control of the White House and both houses of Congress, the ability to adjust tax rates has increased significantly,” said Paul Cuddon, a healthcare analyst at Numis Securities. “The reasons why mega mergers were hot over the last two years was partly because US companies wanted to make tax savings, but if US rates become more competitive internationally and pharma companies are able to bring money in from offshore, you could see a return to mega mergers as companies awash with cash look to boost their pipeline and save costs.” Such policies would be a massive boon for the likes of Merck, Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer, which have tens of billions of dollars stashed overseas and are stuck paying high rates of corporation tax. Donald Trump FTSE “Even if they could get a tax break on say 10pc of repatriated earnings, it will go straight to the bottom line and in the US, when companies have cash, they tend to spend it,” said Ketan Patel, a fund manager at EdenTree Investment Management. Pfizer, in particular, needs acquisitions to boost it ageing pipeline, and flush with money, it could opt for a major acquisition.  Mick Cooper, an pharma specialist at Trinity Delta, said: “One reason Pfizer went after AstraZeneca was because it had a load of cash offshore, so in that sense there are definitely benefits for big pharma to Trump.” Overall, pharmaceutical and biotech stocks reacted positively to news that Donald Trump would be the next president, rather than Hillary Clinton, whose vociferous rehtoric on “price-goughing” was a major concern for the industry. Although his policies are less clear, Trump does advocate more price transparency in healthcare and a free-market approach to the sector. “He is pro-business fundamentally and pro-competition,” said Dr David Cox, of Panmure Gordon. “Pricing will still be an issue for the industry, but it will be less in the headlines than it would have been under Clinton.” Mr Trump has floated the idea of allowing health insurance to be bought and sold across state lines, which would increase competition and lower prices. Ironically, this is effectively what Obamacare does - a programme that Mr Trump has criticised heavily and promised to scrap. The future president has also suggested he wants to allow cheap generic drugs and other high-price medications to be imported from abroad where they are cheaper. This is called the 'parallel market’ and is currently restricted under US regulations. “I don’t think he will put pressure on innovative R&D driven companies,” said Dr Cox. “It’s more on the generic side I see him taking action. "What Trump is saying is that big pharma can do what they like, but in competition with each other, and that the American people will pay the fairest price.” Accordingly, generic drug makers, such as Mylan, Teva and UK-listed Hikma, could find they have a more difficult time. “I wouldn’t be investing heavily in generic companies,” Dr Cox added. “The safest stocks in pharma will be innovative players.” In brief | What Trump has promised to do on his first day in office Follow Telegraph Business READ MORE ABOUT: Health Health insurance Industry Drugs AstraZeneca Biotech Republicans Hillary Clinton Donald Trump Show more Business latest 15 Nov 2016, 5:24pm Italian growth overtakes Germany as the eurozone’s core slows down  01:46 15 Nov 2016, 5:24pm Pound edges back above $1.24 as Mark Carney calls attacks on central bankers a 'massive blame-deflection exercise' 15 Nov 2016, 5:03pm John Lewis sends perfect Christmas gift to long-suffering Twitter user John Lewis 15 Nov 2016, 4:51pm B&M bullish on store roll-outs despite sterling slump 15 Nov 2016, 4:45pm Wembley developer secures £800m loan from North American funds 15 Nov 2016, 4:09pm Revealed: where to move in the UK if you want to make your salary stretch further  15 Nov 2016, 3:15pm FirstGroup riding high on the dollar as its US businesses drive growth 01:15 15 Nov 2016, 3:01pm What date is Black Friday 2016?

Stroke rates were similar between the two groups, however. NEW ORLEANS -- After stenting patients with atrial fibrillation (Afib), a course of rivaroxaban (Xarelto) -- in combination with either a P2Y12 inhibitor or dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) -- was safer than a warfarin-DAPT combination, a late-breaking trial showed. At 1 year, clinically-significant bleeding was less frequent on rivaroxaban plus a P2Y12 inhibitor than with warfarin/DAPT (16.8% versus 26.7%, HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.47-0.76), the PIONEER AF-PCI investigators found. Bleeding was also less common among those who got a triple therapy regimen of rivaroxaban, a P2Y12 inhibitor, and aspirin (18.0% versus 26.7%, HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.50-0.80). However, the composite outcome of cardiac death, MI, and stroke was equally likely among groups (6.5% for rivaroxaban/single antiplatelet versus 5.6% for triple therapy versus 6.0% for warfarin/DAPT, P=N.S.), as was stent thrombosis (0.8% versus 0.9% versus 0.7%, P=N.S.), C. Michael Gibson, MD, of Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, told the audience at a late-breaking clinical trial session at the annual American Heart Association meeting here. But despite the similar efficacy rates, "the observed broad confidence intervals diminish the surety of any conclusions regarding efficacy," Gibson's group cautioned in the paper simultaneously published online in the New England Journal of Medicine. In particular, when compared to warfarin/DAPT, stroke was not less common with rivaroxaban and a single P2Y12 inhibitor (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.39-2.96) or with triple therapy (HR 1.36, 95% CI 0.52-3.58). However, "this trial does not establish noninferiority of rivaroxaban-based strategies vs vitamin K antagonists for stroke prevention," argued discussant Philippe Gabriel Steg, MD, of Hôpital Bichat in Paris, citing the wide confidence intervals for stroke. The PIONEER AF-PCI trial included 2,124 participants with nonvalvular Afib who had been stented. Patients were randomized to three groups: low-dose rivaroxaban (15 mg once daily) plus a P2Y12 inhibitor -- clopidogrel (Plavix) for more than 80%, or less commonly ticagrelor (Brilinta) or prasugrel (Effient) -- for 12 months; a "baby-dose" of rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) plus DAPT for 1, 6, or 12 months; or standard therapy with warfarin (once daily) plus DAPT for 1, 6, or 12 months. In a separate post hoc analysis of the trial published in Circulation, combined all-cause mortality or hospitalization was reduced in the rivaroxaban groups compared to the warfarin control, with an advantage in both the low-dose group (34.9% versus 41.9%, HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66-0.94, number needed to treat=15) and the "baby-dose" group (31.9% versus 41.9%, HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.90, number needed to treat=10). "This paper may be one of those rare circumstances where the secondary post hoc analysis is more insightful than the primary pre-specified analysis, having both greater statistical power and a more clinically relevant endpoint. Of course, from a statistical point of view this may be viewed as a heretical stance, but physicians in actual practice need to make complex decisions with the best available data," Deepak L. Bhatt, MD, MPH, of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, wrote in an accompanying editorial in Circulation. "From the PIONEER data to date, there seem to be significant benefits from abandoning the strategy of full dose triple therapy, with no apparent downside," he concluded. "For the time being, in patients not in clinical trials, full dose oral triple therapy with dual antiplatelet agents and full dose anticoagulation should be avoided as a routine practice." The trial had several limitations, its authors acknowledged. "First, the secondary analyses showed that the efficacy of each of the two doses of rivaroxaban was similar to that of standard therapy. However, the number of secondary efficacy end points in this study was small, and the trial was not powered to definitively establish either superiority or noninferiority." And because the rivaroxaban dose was reduced but not that of warfarin/DAPT, Steg asked: "Is this a fair comparison?" Furthermore, DAPT duration was a major potential confounder. "Stratification to 1, 6, or 12 months of DAPT was based on clinician choice, and patients were not randomly assigned to a duration of DAPT. As might be expected, patient characteristics were imbalanced across the strata of DAPT durations and within each stratum of DAPT durations across the three treatment groups," according to Gibson and colleagues. The study was funded by Janssen and Bayer. Gibson declared receiving grant support from Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Johnson & Johnson, Angel Medical Corporation, Bayer, CSL Behring, Ikaria, Portola Pharmaceuticals, Stealth Peptides, and St. Jude Medical; as well as receiving personal fees from The Medicines Company, Boston Clinical Research Institute, Cardiovascular Research Foundation, Eli Lilly, Gilead, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, WebMD, and UpToDate in Cardiovascular Medicine.

(Carlo Allegri/Reuters) Listen 7:36 more stories from this episode How a Trump presidency could affect health care in Canada Noisy hospitals are putting patients at risk. Here's why. Full Episode Donald Trump's surprise victory as U.S. President likely means big changes on the health file in the U.S. During the campaign, he called Canada's health care system a disaster. That got me wondering just how a Trump administration might affect health care in Canada. Obviously, the most immediate impact will be felt in the U.S., where, during the campaign, Trump promised to "repeal and replace" the Affordable Care Act - something Republican leaders in Congress have also pledged. That can't happen until the 115th Congress early in 2017. It won't be a complete repeal for three reasons. First, the Republicans hold 51 seats (barring recounts), well short of the 60 needed to prevent the Democrats from filibuster - effectively shutting Senate business down. Second, it's not one bill but many implementations that run more than 1,000 pages.  Third, and most important, repeal would mean canceling health care for millions of Americans. It would also mean the end of popular provisions of Obamacare that could get lots of pushback from the public. Late last week Trump said he's prepared to keep popular provisions such as providing coverage for pre-existing health conditions and allowing young adults to remain on their parents' plans until age 26. That signals to me he'll keep more of Obamacare than he's letting on. Assuming a complete repeal of Obamacare is unlikely, there are things Trump can do instead. A Congress controlled by Republicans is likely to phase out a planned expansion of Medicaid coverage.Medicaid is the agency that provides health care to Americans who can't afford it.  U.S. federal taxes were supposed to cover much of the cost of the expansion, but that could change under Trump.  Vox estimates that 15 million Americans have signed up for Medicaid coverage since the Obamacare's expansion began. Individual states that can't afford to expand Medicaid can apply for waivers in the rules - for instance, forcing people who receive Medicaid to pay premiums and requiring them to work in order to be eligible. Obama tended to reject these kinds of waivers, but Trump might be different. Trump has also vowed to get rid of red tape. The big thing he has proposed is to pay states a block of cash for Medicaid and allow states manage the money as they see fit.   Prior to the U.S. election, Americans and Canadians saw huge increases in the price of prescription drugs. No one is sure what a Trump administration is likely to do about that. On the one hand, Trump has proposed things that the American people may like but are opposed by drug companies. He is in favour of transparency for drug prices. He wants to import drugs from India and other countries. He wants Medicare (the agency the provides healthcare to U.S. seniors) to negotiate the prices it pays for prescription drugs. He has also promised to do battle with drug company lobbyists.   So why then are shares in drug companies like Pfizer and Merck up substantially? Perhaps it's because whatever populist ideas Trump has will be less onerous to deal with than the proposal of Hillary Clinton to set up a federal task force to evaluate increases in drug prices. According to a recent survey of investors, 80 percent believe that drug pricing reforms won't happen under a Trump administration.   The Zika virus could be another hot file during the Trump presidency. In August, Trump was asked how he would handle the Zika outbreak.  He said Congress should approve additional funding to combat the virus. Trump voiced approval of the plan by local officials in Florida to hand spray affected areas to control the virus.   I am speculating that Trump would also approve of the plan by a county in the Florida Keys to have the British biotech company Oxitec release millions of genetically-modified mosquitoes to combat the virus. The FDA approved a clinical trial in August, but to move forward in a plebiscite.  Last Tuesday, Monroe County voters gave the study its approval. But some communities voted the proposal down. Trump's impact on this situation is unclear. Canadians are watching events unfold in the U.S., and are wondering how might Trump have an impact on health care here in Canada. I think the spill-over effect could be enormous. In voting for Trump, Americans voted for a president who railed against the status quo.  If, under his watch, deregulation leads to faster approval of pharmaceutical drugs and cheaper drug prices because they're imported from countries such as India, there will be enormous pressure on Canada to follow the same path. I think his impact may be even bigger than that. I think we're coming to a time when an articulate politician in Canada could make the case that publicly-funded health care as currently set up has outlived its usefulness.That politician (likely provincial) might state that the provinces should stop being a provider of health care, and let the private sector pick up the slack. Trump is on record approving something called Health Savings Accounts. Basically, this a fund that Americans would contribute to tax-free - with the fund being used to pay for personal health expenditures.   I could see an advocate of private health care in Canada setting up Health Savings Accounts for all citizens regardless of their ability to pay, and providing a means-tested cash infusion to those below a certain income level. To get widespread buy-in and to ease the transition, there would likely be generous tax credits across most income groups. I don't agree with any of the foregoing. I believe that a publicly-funded health care system with the government as the provider of care is the most efficient and fairest system going. However, we'd be mistaken to think Canada's health care system is immune to massive upheaval and an appetite for change.

Treasury yields have launched through 3%. The U.S. dollar is very strong. Yes, investors were taken by surprise last week, when Donald Trump won the election. What you are seeing in the market is evidence of this. Investors are scrambling to adjust their positions to account for an entirely new set of expectations.  And what exactly are these new expectations? We have to sift through the market action and see which stocks are reacting to get a feel for these new expectations. That's my job, or at least, that's what I'm doing right now. I can tell you at the outset, some of the early signals the market is giving off seem misguided. But others look rock solid. Let's start with the rock-solid moves... The most solid move I'm seeing right now is coming from banks. Just look at this move for Bank of America (NYSE: BAC)... That's $17 to $20 in four days. And the volume bars along the bottom of that chart show the biggest surge in buying pressure the stock has seen since the beginning of 2014. I think it's legit... For one, Bank of America has been trading at a discount to tangible book value for years. If you don't know, tangible book value is "bricks and mortar" valuation that simply seeks to put a monetary value on the buildings and other assets of a company. Goodwill measures and earnings don't count toward tangible book value. I have recommended Bank of America here in Wealth Daily before, largely due to the fact that it has been the most undervalued bank out there.  I wrote last week that BofA and the other banks were rallying because "the 'break up the banks' duo of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have lost influence." But there's even more to it than that. It has to do with the Dodd-Frank banking regulation law.  Now, this law was passed to prevent banks from engaging in the type of behavior that helped bring about the financial crisis. The law basically says that banks have to have more ready cash on hand (Tier 1 capital) and can't make their business all about trading risky assets, like mortgage-backed securities.  Dodd-Frank has long been a target of Republicans. They don't like it because they believe it restricts a bank's ability to make money. And Republicans generally favor less regulation, and Dodd-Frank adds layers of compliance rules that banks have spent millions to understand and implement. Now, there's a very interesting proposal concerning Dodd-Frank. Some are suggesting that banks should have a "buyout" option. That is, banks that get their Tier 1 capital above Dodd-Frank requirements should be able to start adding some exposure to more risky assets (i.e. mortgage backed securities) to boost their earnings power.  This is a great idea because it rewards good behavior. If you simply let banks do what they want, they will absolutely put the economy at risk again. They did it in the late 1980s, giving us the S&L crisis, and they did it 20 years later with the housing bubble. So adding a "good behavior buyout" to Dodd-Frank is a reasonable compromise to keeping banks healthy and also letting them leverage their earnings.  I've had a $24 target for BofA. Because at $24, BofA would trade at book value and at about a 25% premium to tangible book value. Both of these valuations seem reasonable. And investors are buying the stock as fast as they can right now because not only are these valuations reasonable, but they are also realistic in the near future.  The Best Free Investment You'll Ever Make Stay on top of the hottest investment ideas before they hit Wall Street. Sign up for the Wealth Daily newsletter below. You'll also get our free report, "Five Techincal Analysis Tools for Investors." We never spam! View our Privacy Policy Another Solid Move I also think the rally for biotech and pharmaceuticals is legit. Yeah, Clinton had targeted drug prices in her campaign. Trump seems unlikely to go after any companies. So biotech drug prices are probably OK.  Biotechs have been sold steadily for six months. They are the very epitome of beaten down. So much so that they had already started to rally before the election. I think biotechs will continue to make up ground. And there's another catalyst that's not getting much play: a cash repatriation tax holiday. Here's the logic... Trump is a businessman. Not a very good one, but that's beside the point. The single best way he can get his administration off on a good foot is to get corporate America behind him. He can easily do this by simply offering U.S. companies the one-time opportunity to bring foreign cash home and pay a low tax rate, like 10%. And pharmaceuticals like Merck (NYSE: MRK) and Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) have a lot of money overseas.  Let them bring it back, and they are likely to put it to work — with acquisitions in the biotech space.  The BS Moves I'm gonna start this section with a question. What other group of companies has a lot of cash overseas?  Yeah, tech companies. And big tech companies have been creamed over the last few days. Facebook, Amazon, Apple — they are all off between 7% and 10%. Near as I can tell, investors are worried that Trump's immigration actions might keep these companies from attracting talent from overseas, and so their businesses might suffer. That just doesn't seem reasonable. Apple is the biggest company in the world. It's simply not going to get steamrolled by policy. And Apple could have a lot of cash to put to work if there is a tax holiday on overseas cash.  So, I think the big sell-off for tech stocks is overdone. Buying them now for a trade is probably a very good idea.  One More BS Move I do think Trump will get an infrastructure bill passed. Republicans have resisted increases in spending under Obama. But that's because they don't like him and they haven't wanted to help him succeed (regardless of what's good for the country). But now that there's a Republican in charge, you can bet they will open the purse strings.  Still, even with a big infrastructure spending bill, should shares of Caterpillar be trading near two-year highs? The forward P/E for CAT is now 29. And revenue is still expected to be flat from this year to next. Flat, as in no growth. Seems to me that CAT might sell a few more pieces of heavy machinery under a spending bill. But I don't see how they sell enough to justify a forward P/E of 29. Aren't there a bunch CAT machines sitting around idle right now?  I'm looking at buying some puts on CAT at the first sign of weakness.

My apologies to Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Minneapolis Fed president and former TARP director Neel Kashkari, but breaking up America's largest banks is a really dumb idea. Buy This Biotech Since July 2015, it's been a pretty consistent move lower for biotechs. But when you see a drop like this, you should start getting interested, especially if the overall stock market has been doing pretty well. Could a Peter Schiff and Donald Trump Economic Plan Work?

Comments Buffett's Envy: 50% Annual Returns, Guaranteed Warren Buffett once told investors at an annual shareholder meeting, "...it's a huge structural advantage not to have a lot of money. I think I could make you 50% a year on $1 million. No, I know I could. I guarantee that." Buffett later went on to talk about one incredible advantage that average, smaller investors have over Berkshire.

(NASDAQ:ANTH), Dynavax Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:DVAX) SHARE ON: Claudia Dawson — November 14, 2016 Shares of Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ANTH) added 2.63% by the end of trading session at $1.95. For the current quarter, the 3 brokerage firms issuing adjusted earnings per share outlook have a consensus forecast of -$0.42/share, which would compare with -$0.18 in the year-ago quarter. The net percentage change is -62.21% over the last 12 months. The trading range in the same period had a highest hit of $6.08 while lowest level was $1.72. At the moment the price is -31.65% below its 50-day moving average and -40.01% below its 200-day moving average. Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ANTH) on November 10, 2016 announced that the CHABLIS-SC1 clinical trial with blisibimod for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) failed to meet its primary endpoint based upon the SLE Responder Index-6 (SRI-6) at 52 weeks. Although 47% of patients in the blisibimod arm versus 42% of patients in the placebo arm achieved this endpoint, the difference was not statistically significant.  The SRI is a composite index comprised of SELENA-SLEDAI, BILAG and Physician Global Assessment criteria.  A SRI-6 response requires a decrease of at least 6 points in SELENA-SLEDAI.  The magnitude of blisibimod treatment effects for other SLE Response (SRI-4, and SRI-8) also did not achieve statistical significance. Serum biological markers including B-cells, immunoglobulins, and complement demonstrated statistically significant treatment effects consistent with expectations and previous blisibimod clinical studies in lupus and IgA nephropathy. Adverse events between the blisibimod and placebo treatment arms were well balanced and blisibimod was generally well tolerated. The Company will continue to analyze the data in the coming weeks from the CHABLIS-SC1 trial in consultation with key lupus disease thought leaders to expeditiously determine the future of the blisibimod lupus program including the on-going CHABLIS 7.5 clinical study.  As the pharmacological effects on immunological markers, such as B-cells and immunoglobulins, were as expected, the company is continuing the development of blisibimod for the treatment of IgA Nephropathy (IgAN) pending 48 week results from the ongoing phase 2 BRIGHT study.  IgAN has a very different pathogenesis than systemic lupus, and the pharmacological activity of blisibimod might prove effective in its treatment.  The Company expects to report 48-week data from the BRIGHT-SC IgAN study and topline data from the Sollpura™ SOLUTION phase 3 study later this year. Dynavax Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:DVAX) last exchanged hands at a price $11.6/share, registering a gain of 2.65%. Among 4 Wall Street analysts tracked by Thomson/First Call, the average PT for DVAX is $31 but some of them are predicting the price to move at the $45 level. If the most optimistic analysts are correct, the expected total return from the current price would be 287.93. The number of shares traded in most recent trading day was 1.13M shares which averages 1.58M shares a day. Its previous fifty two week high was $29.86 and moved down -52.98% over the same time frame, currently having a market cap around $448.92 million. Shares have risen -27.5% over the trailing six months. At the moment, the stock trades 5.08% above its 50-day moving average and -25.56% below its 200-day moving average. Dynavax Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:DVAX) on November 9, 2016 announced the presentation of findings from an ongoing Phase 1b/2 study investigating SD-101, Dynavax’s intratumoral TLR9 agonist, in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy. Early results investigating 13 patients with metastatic melanoma for efficacy and 19 patients for safety were reported. In patients naïve to anti-PD-1 treatment, objective responses were observed in four out of five (80%) patients, including one complete response (CR) and three partial responses (PR’s). Four patients with progressive disease, while receiving anti-PD-1 monotherapy prior to enrollment, were observed to have stable disease (SD) while receiving KEYTRUDA and SD-101. These data were presented by Dr. Antoni Ribas in the late-breaking clinical update session on Wednesday, November 9, at the Society for Melanoma Research (SMR) 13th International Congress in Boston, MA, USA. SD-101 in combination with KEYTRUDA was well-tolerated. No dose-limiting toxicities of the combination were observed in any dose cohort, and a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not identified. No immune-related adverse events were reported, and the most common treatment-emergent adverse events were grade 1 to 2 flu-like symptoms, including fever, chills and myalgia consistent with the engagement of TLR9 and production of interferon alpha. The study also included biomarker assessments, suggesting that treatment with SD-101 and KEYTRUDA resulted in elevation of gene signatures consistent with an increase in Th1 immune cell types as well as an increase in immune cell infiltrates such as CD8+ T-cells in the tumor microenvironment.

WALL STREET: Tech companies including Apple and Microsoft took big losses on concern Trump's policies might hurt their sales in China and other global markets. Bank stocks surged as bond yields rose, which allows them to make more money from lending. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 18,868.69, another all-time high. The Standard & Poor's 500 index dipped 0.25 points to 2,164.20 after it fell as much as 0.4 percent earlier. The Nasdaq composite sank 18.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,218.40. RISING DOLLAR: The dollar climbed as high as 108.30 yen from Monday's 107.87 yen as expectations of a U.S. rate hike rose. Trump's surprise election initially raised expectations the Federal Reserve might put off a rate hike until his plans were clear. But analysts say the latest comments from Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan indicate the Fed is sticking to plans to act in December. "There appears no stopping the U.S. dollar's recent ascent based on the current interest rate trajectory," Stephen Innes of OANDA said in a report. TRUMP WATCH: Investors were watching for signs of what Trump, who gave few details of his plans on the campaign trail, might do in office. Analysts say his promises of tax cuts and higher infrastructure spending could boost economic growth but also spur inflation. His threats of sanctions against China and other trading partners that he accuses of acting unfairly have rattled trade-dependent Asian economies. ANALYST'S TAKE: "Moving forward, the spotlight could shine on the contentious trade policy proposals that the president-elect had raised during his campaign," said Jingyi Pan of IG in a report. "The latest soundbite from outgoing President Barack Obama seems to suggest that the incoming president is 'ultimately pragmatic'," said Pan. "It is without a doubt that emerging Asian markets would be negatively impacted should a trade war break out between US and China, although the delayed address could mean that the President-elect may indeed be more pragmatic than we have known."

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks came back from an early loss and finished almost unchanged Monday. Technology companies like Apple and Microsoft took big losses on fears about their overseas revenue, but bank stocks continued to surge along with bond yields. Technology stocks have been weak since last week's election, and they fell further Monday as investors wonder if Donald Trump's policies as president will hurt their sales in China and other markets overseas. Bank stocks built on their post-election gains as bond yields continued to rise. That paves the way for banks to make more money from lending. Government bond yields are now at their highest levels since January. "The market is sniffing out the belief that some of these Trump policies may drive some better economic growth but also may in fact be somewhat inflationary," said PNC Chief Investment Strategist Bill Stone. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 18,868.69, another all-time high. The Standard & Poor's 500 index dipped 0.25 points to 2,164.20 after it fell as much as 0.4 percent earlier. The Nasdaq composite sank 18.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,218.40. Technology companies fell sharply, with familiar names taking some of the largest losses. Apple gave up $2.72, or 2.5 percent, to $105.71 while Facebook declined $3.94, or 3.3 percent, to $115.08 and Microsoft slid 90 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $58.12. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, slipped $18.53, or 2.4 percent, to $753.22. Bond prices fell and yields jumped as investors anticipated that Trump's spending plans would lead to higher inflation and more government borrowing. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note climbed to 2.25 percent from 2.14 percent late Thursday. Bond trading was closed Friday for the Veterans' Day holiday. The day before the Nov. 8 election, the yield was 1.83 percent. That's a huge move for that benchmark rate. Goldman Sachs rose $5.24 percent, to 2.6 percent, to $209.18 and Bank of America rose $1.06, or 5.6 percent, to $20.08. JPMorgan Chase picked up $2.82, or 3.7 percent, to $79.51. Stone said investors are focused on potential corporate and individual tax cuts, a "wave of deregulation" that eliminates some of the rules governing businesses like energy companies and banks, and more protectionism on trade, which could hurt sales for companies that do a lot of business overseas. Investors are also pleased at the prospect of looser regulation and bigger profits. For example, Trump's election could result in big changes to the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill or to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Stone added that corporate dealmaking could increase if Trump's administration takes a looser approach to antitrust regulation. Several companies announced deals or deal offers Monday. South Korean conglomerate Samsung said it will buy Harman International for $8 billion, or $112 a share. Harman makes electronics for cars including audio systems and safety and entertainment features. Its stock jumped $22.07, or 25.2 percent, to $109.72. German industrial equipment company Siemens agreed to buy software maker Mentor Graphics for $4.5 billion, or $37.25 a share. Mentor's stock rose $5.61, or 18.3 percent, to $36.29. Shares of communication adapter maker Digi International rose $1.75, or 15 percent, to $13.40 after the company said it received an offer from Belden, a communications equipment company. Digi said it rejected the bid of $13.82 a share, or about $359 million, because it's too low. Belden stock added $1.52, or 2.2 percent, to $71.22. The dollar rose against other currencies as U.S. interest rates rose. It jumped to 108.51 Japanese yen from 106.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0726 from $1.0845. Investors are also selling companies that pay big dividends like utilities and phone companies as bonds become more appealing to investors seeking income. Verizon fell 51 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $46.18 and American Electric Power lost $1.27, or 2.1 percent, to $58.72.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Alnylam Pharmaceuticals and The Medicines Company Announce Publication of Phase 1 Clinical Data with Inclisiran (ALN- PCSsc) in the New England Journal of Medicine Interim Results from ORION-1 Phase 2 Study of Inclisiran to be Presented in Late-Breaking Clinical Trial Session at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions on November 15, 2016 CAMBRIDGE, Mass. & PARSIPANY, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:ALNY), the leading RNAi therapeutics company, and The Medicines Company (Nasdaq:MDCO), a leading biopharmaceutical development and cardiovascular product company, today announced that results from the Phase 1 study of inclisiran (in-CLEE-si-ran), the recommended International Nonproprietary Name (INN) for ALN-PCSsc, were published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Inclisiran is an investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting PCSK9 – a genetically validated protein regulator of LDL receptor metabolism – being developed for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. The paper can be found online here. Results from the study showed doses ≥300 mg (single or multiple doses) significantly reduced PCSK9 and LDL cholesterol for at least 6 months. Moreover, inclisiran was found to be generally well tolerated. “The published findings from our Phase 1 trial with inclisiran add to the clinical evidence supporting PCSK9 as a therapeutic target for significantly lowering LDL cholesterol, as well as the ability of RNAi therapeutic candidates to inhibit synthesis of liver-derived target proteins in a potent and durable manner,” said Akshay Vaishnaw, M.D., Ph.D., Executive Vice President of R&D and Chief Medical Officer of Alnylam. “We believe that inclisiran represents an innovative and differentiated approach for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.” Inclisiran is currently being studied in the ORION-1 Phase 2 study by The Medicines Company. With more than 500 patients enrolled, ORION-1 is the largest study of a GalNAc-siRNA conjugate to date. The Medicines Company recently announced positive top-line results from the day 90 interim analysis of the Phase 2 study demonstrating significant and durable LDL-C reduction that validates the potential for a triannual or biannual dosing regimen. Top-line results also showed that inclisiran was generally well tolerated, with no evidence of drug-related elevations of liver enzymes, neuropathy adverse events, or changes in renal function. The Medicines Company plans to present complete interim results from the ongoing study in a Late-Breaking Clinical Trial Session at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions on November 15, 2016. “We look forward to presenting the interim results of the ORION-1 Phase 2 data at AHA this week including Day 90 follow-up results for all 501 patients and a preliminary analysis of Day 180 follow-up for up to 200 patients,” said David Kallend, MBBS, Vice President and Global Medical Director at The Medicines Company. “Based on the strong results from the Phase 1 study, we hope to further elucidate the hypothesis of triannual or biannual dosing of inclisiran with the ORION-1 results.” The NEJM publication highlights key results from the Phase 1 clinical trial of inclisiran, including safety and pharmacodynamic measures (PCSK9, LDL cholesterol, exploratory lipid parameters). In the single-ascending-dose (SAD) phase, pharmacodynamic measures showed: Doses ≥300 mg reduced PCSK9 at day 84 (up to a least-squares mean (LSM) reduction of 74.5%); Doses ≥100 mg reduced LDL cholesterol at day 84 (up to a LSM reduction of 50.6%); Reductions in PCSK9 and LDL cholesterol were maintained at day 180 with little variation over the 6-month period for doses ≥300 mg. In the multiple-dose (MD) phase, pharmacodynamic measures showed: Reduced PCSK9 (up to a LSM reduction of 83.8%) and LDL cholesterol (up to a LSM reduction of 59.7%) at day 84; Levels of PCSK9 and LDL cholesterol remained reduced in all the inclisiran cohorts at day 196. Safety and side effect profile evaluations showed: Inclisiran was generally well tolerated following single and multiple subcutaneous dose administration; No serious adverse events (SAEs) or discontinuations due to AEs were reported; All observed adverse events (AEs) were mild or moderate in severity; There was one Grade 3 GGT elevation considered related to statin therapy. The lead development responsibility for inclisiran transitioned from Alnylam to The Medicines Company in August 2015. The two companies are now working to advance inclisiran in the ORION development program, a comprehensive global clinical development plan designed to support regulatory approval and market access worldwide. About the Inclisiran Phase 1 Study The Phase 1 trial of inclisiran was conducted in the U.K. as a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending- and multi-dose, subcutaneous dose-escalation study. The study enrolled 69 volunteer subjects with elevated baseline LDL-C (≥ 100 mg/dL), with subjects randomized 3:1, drug: placebo. The study was performed in two phases: a single ascending dose (SAD) phase and a multiple dose (MD) phase. The MD phase also included subjects both on and off stable doses of statin co-medication. The primary objective of the Phase 1 study was to evaluate the safety, side effect profile, and pharmacodynamics effects of inclisiran. About Hypercholesterolemia Hypercholesterolemia is a condition characterized by very high levels of cholesterol in the blood which is known to increase the risk of coronary artery disease, the leading cause of death in the U.S. Some forms of hypercholesterolemia can be treated through dietary restrictions, lifestyle modifications (e.g., exercise and smoking cessation) and medicines such as statins. However, a large proportion of patients with hypercholesterolemia are not achieving adequate LDL-C levels with currently available therapies such as statins, including genetic familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) patients, acute coronary syndrome patients, high-risk patient populations (e.g., patients with coronary artery disease, diabetes, symptomatic carotid artery disease, etc.) and other patients that are statin intolerant. Severe forms of hypercholesterolemia are estimated to affect more than 500,000 patients worldwide, and as a result, there is a significant need for novel therapeutics to treat patients with hypercholesterolemia whose disease is inadequately managed by existing therapies. About GalNAc Conjugates and Enhanced Stabilization Chemistry (ESC)-GalNAc Conjugates GalNAc-siRNA conjugates are a proprietary Alnylam delivery platform and are designed to achieve targeted delivery of RNAi therapeutics to hepatocytes through uptake by the asialoglycoprotein receptor. Alnylam’s Enhanced Stabilization Chemistry (ESC)-GalNAc-conjugate technology enables subcutaneous dosing with increased potency and durability, and a wide therapeutic index. This ESC-GalNAc-conjugate delivery platform is being employed in nearly all of Alnylam’s pipeline programs, including inclisiran and several other programs in clinical development. About RNAi RNAi (RNA interference) is a revolution in biology, representing a breakthrough in understanding how genes are turned on and off in cells, and a completely new approach to drug discovery and development. Its discovery has been heralded as “a major scientific breakthrough that happens once every decade or so,” and represents one of the most promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug discovery today which was awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. RNAi is a natural process of gene silencing that occurs in organisms ranging from plants to mammals. By harnessing the natural biological process of RNAi occurring in our cells, the creation of a major new class of medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics, is on the horizon. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate RNAi and comprise Alnylam’s RNAi therapeutic platform, target the cause of diseases by potently silencing specific mRNAs, thereby preventing disease-causing proteins from being made. RNAi therapeutics have the potential to treat disease and help patients in a fundamentally new way. About Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Alnylam is a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics based on RNA interference, or RNAi. The company is leading the translation of RNAi as a new class of innovative medicines. Alnylam’s pipeline of investigational RNAi therapeutics is focused in 3 Strategic Therapeutic Areas (STArs): Genetic Medicines, with a broad pipeline of RNAi therapeutics for the treatment of rare diseases; Cardio-Metabolic Disease, with a pipeline of RNAi therapeutics toward genetically validated, liver-expressed disease targets for unmet needs in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; and Hepatic Infectious Disease, with a pipeline of RNAi therapeutics that address the major global health challenges of hepatic infectious diseases. In early 2015, Alnylam launched its “Alnylam 2020” guidance for the advancement and commercialization of RNAi therapeutics as a whole new class of innovative medicines. Specifically, by the end of 2020, Alnylam expects to achieve a company profile with 3 marketed products, 10 RNAi therapeutic clinical programs – including 4 in late stages of development – across its 3 STArs. The company’s demonstrated commitment to RNAi therapeutics has enabled it to form major alliances with leading companies including Ionis, Novartis, Roche, Takeda, Merck, Monsanto, The Medicines Company, and Sanofi Genzyme. In addition, Alnylam holds an equity position in Regulus Therapeutics Inc., a company focused on discovery, development, and commercialization of microRNA therapeutics. Alnylam scientists and collaborators have published their research on RNAi therapeutics in over 200 peer-reviewed papers, including many in the world’s top scientific journals such as Nature, Nature Medicine, Nature Biotechnology, Cell, New England Journal of Medicine, and The Lancet. Founded in 2002, Alnylam maintains headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. For more information about Alnylam’s pipeline of investigational RNAi therapeutics, please visit www.alnylam.com.

Moreover, inclisiran was found to be generally well tolerated. “The published findings from our Phase 1 trial with inclisiran add to the clinical evidence supporting PCSK9 as a therapeutic target for significantly lowering LDL cholesterol, as well as the ability of RNAi therapeutic candidates to inhibit synthesis of liver-derived target proteins in a potent and durable manner,” said Akshay Vaishnaw, M.D., Ph.D., Executive Vice President of R&D and Chief Medical Officer of Alnylam. “We believe that inclisiran represents an innovative and differentiated approach for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.” Inclisiran is currently being studied in the ORION-1 Phase 2 study by The Medicines Company. With more than 500 patients enrolled, ORION-1 is the largest study of a GalNAc-siRNA conjugate to date. The Medicines Company recently announced positive top-line results from the day 90 interim analysis of the Phase 2 study demonstrating significant and durable LDL-C reduction that validates the potential for a triannual or biannual dosing regimen. Top-line results also showed that inclisiran was generally well tolerated, with no evidence of drug-related elevations of liver enzymes, neuropathy adverse events, or changes in renal function. The Medicines Company plans to present complete interim results from the ongoing study in a Late-Breaking Clinical Trial Session at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions on November 15, 2016. “We look forward to presenting the interim results of the ORION-1 Phase 2 data at AHA this week including Day 90 follow-up results for all 501 patients and a preliminary analysis of Day 180 follow-up for up to 200 patients,” said David Kallend, MBBS, Vice President and Global Medical Director at The Medicines Company. “Based on the strong results from the Phase 1 study, we hope to further elucidate the hypothesis of triannual or biannual dosing of inclisiran with the ORION-1 results.” The NEJM publication highlights key results from the Phase 1 clinical trial of inclisiran, including safety and pharmacodynamic measures (PCSK9, LDL cholesterol, exploratory lipid parameters). In the single-ascending-dose (SAD) phase, pharmacodynamic measures showed: Doses ≥300 mg reduced PCSK9 at day 84 (up to a least-squares mean (LSM) reduction of 74.5%); Doses ≥100 mg reduced LDL cholesterol at day 84 (up to a LSM reduction of 50.6%); Reductions in PCSK9 and LDL cholesterol were maintained at day 180 with little variation over the 6-month period for doses ≥300 mg. In the multiple-dose (MD) phase, pharmacodynamic measures showed: Reduced PCSK9 (up to a LSM reduction of 83.8%) and LDL cholesterol (up to a LSM reduction of 59.7%) at day 84; Levels of PCSK9 and LDL cholesterol remained reduced in all the inclisiran cohorts at day 196. Safety and side effect profile evaluations showed: Inclisiran was generally well tolerated following single and multiple subcutaneous dose administration; No serious adverse events (SAEs) or discontinuations due to AEs were reported; All observed adverse events (AEs) were mild or moderate in severity; There was one Grade 3 GGT elevation considered related to statin therapy. The lead development responsibility for inclisiran transitioned from Alnylam to The Medicines Company in August 2015. The two companies are now working to advance inclisiran in the ORION development program, a comprehensive global clinical development plan designed to support regulatory approval and market access worldwide. About the Inclisiran Phase 1 Study The Phase 1 trial of inclisiran was conducted in the U.K. as a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending- and multi-dose, subcutaneous dose-escalation study. The study enrolled 69 volunteer subjects with elevated baseline LDL-C (≥ 100 mg/dL), with subjects randomized 3:1, drug: placebo. The study was performed in two phases: a single ascending dose (SAD) phase and a multiple dose (MD) phase. The MD phase also included subjects both on and off stable doses of statin co-medication. The primary objective of the Phase 1 study was to evaluate the safety, side effect profile, and pharmacodynamics effects of inclisiran. About Hypercholesterolemia Hypercholesterolemia is a condition characterized by very high levels of cholesterol in the blood which is known to increase the risk of coronary artery disease, the leading cause of death in the U.S. Some forms of hypercholesterolemia can be treated through dietary restrictions, lifestyle modifications (e.g., exercise and smoking cessation) and medicines such as statins. However, a large proportion of patients with hypercholesterolemia are not achieving adequate LDL-C levels with currently available therapies such as statins, including genetic familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) patients, acute coronary syndrome patients, high-risk patient populations (e.g., patients with coronary artery disease, diabetes, symptomatic carotid artery disease, etc.) and other patients that are statin intolerant. Severe forms of hypercholesterolemia are estimated to affect more than 500,000 patients worldwide, and as a result, there is a significant need for novel therapeutics to treat patients with hypercholesterolemia whose disease is inadequately managed by existing therapies. About GalNAc Conjugates and Enhanced Stabilization Chemistry (ESC)-GalNAc Conjugates GalNAc-siRNA conjugates are a proprietary Alnylam delivery platform and are designed to achieve targeted delivery of RNAi therapeutics to hepatocytes through uptake by the asialoglycoprotein receptor. Alnylam’s Enhanced Stabilization Chemistry (ESC)-GalNAc-conjugate technology enables subcutaneous dosing with increased potency and durability, and a wide therapeutic index. This ESC-GalNAc-conjugate delivery platform is being employed in nearly all of Alnylam’s pipeline programs, including inclisiran and several other programs in clinical development. About RNAi RNAi (RNA interference) is a revolution in biology, representing a breakthrough in understanding how genes are turned on and off in cells, and a completely new approach to drug discovery and development. Its discovery has been heralded as “a major scientific breakthrough that happens once every decade or so,” and represents one of the most promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug discovery today which was awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. RNAi is a natural process of gene silencing that occurs in organisms ranging from plants to mammals. By harnessing the natural biological process of RNAi occurring in our cells, the creation of a major new class of medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics, is on the horizon. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate RNAi and comprise Alnylam’s RNAi therapeutic platform, target the cause of diseases by potently silencing specific mRNAs, thereby preventing disease-causing proteins from being made. RNAi therapeutics have the potential to treat disease and help patients in a fundamentally new way. About Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Alnylam is a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics based on RNA interference, or RNAi. The company is leading the translation of RNAi as a new class of innovative medicines. Alnylam’s pipeline of investigational RNAi therapeutics is focused in 3 Strategic Therapeutic Areas (STArs): Genetic Medicines, with a broad pipeline of RNAi therapeutics for the treatment of rare diseases; Cardio-Metabolic Disease, with a pipeline of RNAi therapeutics toward genetically validated, liver-expressed disease targets for unmet needs in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; and Hepatic Infectious Disease, with a pipeline of RNAi therapeutics that address the major global health challenges of hepatic infectious diseases. In early 2015, Alnylam launched its “Alnylam 2020” guidance for the advancement and commercialization of RNAi therapeutics as a whole new class of innovative medicines. Specifically, by the end of 2020, Alnylam expects to achieve a company profile with 3 marketed products, 10 RNAi therapeutic clinical programs – including 4 in late stages of development – across its 3 STArs. The company’s demonstrated commitment to RNAi therapeutics has enabled it to form major alliances with leading companies including Ionis, Novartis, Roche, Takeda, Merck, Monsanto, The Medicines Company, and Sanofi Genzyme. In addition, Alnylam holds an equity position in Regulus Therapeutics Inc., a company focused on discovery, development, and commercialization of microRNA therapeutics.

E.S.T. Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story BEIJING — Asian stocks were mostly lower Tuesday as expectations of a U.S. rate hike boosted the dollar and investors watched President-elect Donald Trump for signs of policy direction. KEEPING SCORE: The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.2 percent to 3,204.31 points and Tokyo's Nikkei 225 was flat at 17,670.77. Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 tumbled 0.5 percent to 5,320.60 and Seoul's Kospi was almost unchanged at 1,974.27. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.4 percent to 22,314.62. Benchmarks in Southeast Asia and New Zealand were mixed. WALL STREET: Tech companies including Apple and Microsoft took big losses on concern Trump's policies might hurt their sales in China and other global markets. Bank stocks surged as bond yields rose, which allows them to make more money from lending. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 18,868.69, another all-time high. The Standard & Poor's 500 index dipped 0.25 points to 2,164.20 after it fell as much as 0.4 percent earlier. The Nasdaq composite sank 18.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,218.40. RISING DOLLAR: The dollar climbed as high as 108.30 yen from Monday's 107.87 yen as expectations of a U.S. rate hike rose. Trump's surprise election initially raised expectations the Federal Reserve might put off a rate hike until his plans were clear. But analysts say the latest comments from Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan indicate the Fed is sticking to plans to act in December. "There appears no stopping the U.S. dollar's recent ascent based on the current interest rate trajectory," Stephen Innes of OANDA said in a report. TRUMP WATCH: Investors were watching for signs of what Trump, who gave few details of his plans on the campaign trail, might do in office. Analysts say his promises of tax cuts and higher infrastructure spending could boost economic growth but also spur inflation. His threats of sanctions against China and other trading partners that he accuses of acting unfairly have rattled trade-dependent Asian economies. ANALYST'S TAKE: "Moving forward, the spotlight could shine on the contentious trade policy proposals that the president-elect had raised during his campaign," said Jingyi Pan of IG in a report. "The latest soundbite from outgoing President Barack Obama seems to suggest that the incoming president is 'ultimately pragmatic'," said Pan. "It is without a doubt that emerging Asian markets would be negatively impacted should a trade war break out between US and China, although the delayed address could mean that the President-elect may indeed be more pragmatic than we have known."

ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude gained 89 cents to $44.21 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract shed 9 cents on Monday to close at $43.32. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 75 cents to $45.19 in London. It lost 32 cents on Monday to $44.43. Continue reading the main story We’re interested in your feedback on this page.

The rally in global markets since the election of Donald Trump as the next U.S. president was showing signs of running out of steam Monday, Nov. 14, 2016, as bond investors fretted over the inflationary impact of his policies. That rise in U.S. bond yields saw the dollar notch up some further solid gains, though. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York • Bank stocks are climbing Monday morning as bond yields continue to rise. Bond yields are climbing to their highest levels this year, which points to higher interest rates and bigger profits for banks from lending money. Investors have been selling bonds, pushing yields higher, as they expect the spending plans of president-elect Donald Trump to lead to higher inflation. The big moves for financial firms are pulling the broader stock market higher. Investors are selling companies that pay big dividends like utilities and phone companies as bonds become more appealing to investors seeking income. The dollar is also rising. VIDEOS TOP JOBS KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average rose 79 points, or 0.4 percent, to 18,926 as of 8:20 a.m. Mountain time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 6 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,170. The Nasdaq composite added 3 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,240. BANK BONANZA: Bank stocks continued to surge. They're rising in part because of the big jump in bond yields since the election. Investors are also pleased at the prospect of looser regulation and bigger profits. Trump's election could result in big changes to the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill or to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Bank of America rose 98 cents, or 5.1 percent, to $20 and JPMorgan Chase picked up $2.96 percent, or 3.9 percent, to $79.65. DOING DEALS: South Korean conglomerate Samsung said it will buy Harman International for $8 billion, or $112 a share. Harman makes products for connected cars including audio systems and safety and entertainment features. Its stock jumped $22.08, or 25.2 percent, to $109.73. MENTORING: German industrial equipment company Siemens agreed to buy software maker Mentor Graphics for $4.5 billion, or $37.25 a share. Mentor's stock rose $5.67, or 18.5 percent, to $36.35. DIG IT: Shares of communication adapter maker Digi International rose $1.83, or 14.8 percent, to $13.38 after the company said it received an offer from Belden, a communications equipment company. Digi said it rejected the bid of $13.82 a share, or about $359 million, because it's too low. Belden stock added $1.88, or 2.7 percent, to $71.58. BONDS: Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.25 percent. Bond trading was closed Friday for the U.S. Veterans' Day holiday. The 10-year yield, which is a benchmark for interest rates on home mortgages and other kinds of loans, finished at 2.06 percent on Thursday. The day before the Nov. 8 presidential election the yield was 1.83 percent. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose sharply against other currencies as U.S. interest rates rose. It jumped to 108.41 Japanese yen from 106.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0714 from $1.0845. LAGGARDS: Stocks that pay large dividends, like phone and utility companies and real estate investment trusts, all traded lower. Those stocks are most appealing to investors when bond yields are low. American Tower fell $4.64, or 4.4 percent, to $101.07 and NextEra Energy lost $2.42, or 2.1 percent, to $111.12. TRUMP FACTOR: Stocks went into a long skid as the presidential campaign came to its conclusion, but in the last few days stocks have risen as investors hope a Trump presidency will mean cutbacks in regulations that affect energy and banks, among other businesses. The Dow has reached record highs, with the biggest recent gains going to financial firms Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, machinery maker Caterpillar and drug company Merck. ENERGY: With the dollar gaining strength, benchmark U.S. crude fell 59 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $42.82 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 55 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $44.20 a barrel in London. OVERSEAS: France's CAC 40 was up 0.4 percent and Germany's DAX rose 0.3 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was 0.3 percent higher. In Japan the Nikkei 225 jumped 1.7 percent after a strong reading on Japan's economic growth. The dollar has been particularly strong against the Japanese yen lately and that's helped the country's exporters. Most other Asian markets fell. The Kospi in South Korea lost 0.5 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 1.4 percent.   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES LDS Church 'retires' Mormon apostle's 'little factory' pamphlet Police: Multiple stabbings at Mountain View High School, suspect in custody Critics cringe at Trump strategist Bannon's ties to alt-right, rhetoric targeting Mormons Make a low calorie whipped cream from an unlikely source for your Thanksgiving pumpkin pie Democrat Elijah Cummings presses Jason Chaffetz to investigate Donald Trump's finances ELEVATE Life is a Peach at the SALT Awards   Salt Lake Regional Medical Center First in the U.S. to Perform Meniscus Replacement   From Wall St to Hawaii to Utah Valley: UVU Professor Cary Wasden Mentors MBA Finance Students   Contests and Promotions COMMENTS POST A COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

Login Register Public Release: 13-Nov-2016 Study finds following a healthy lifestyle can greatly reduce genetic heart attack risk Even among those at highest genetic risk, lifestyle factors can reduce incidence by one half Massachusetts General Hospital Share  Print  E-Mail It is well known that following a healthy lifestyle -- not smoking, avoiding excess weight and getting regular exercise - can reduce the risk of heart disease. But what about people who have inherited gene variants known to increase risk? A study led by Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) investigators has found that, even among those at high genetic risk, following a healthy lifestyle can cut in half the probability of a heart attack or similar event. Their report is receiving early online publication in the New England Journal of Medicine to coincide with a presentation at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions. "The basic message of our study is that DNA is not destiny," says Sekar Kathiresan, MD, director of the Center for Human Genetic Research at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), senior author of the NEJM report. "Many individuals - both physicians and members of the general public -- have looked on genetic risk as unavoidable, but for heart attack that does not appear to be the case." In order to investigate whether a healthy lifestyle can mitigate genetic risk, the multi-institutional research team analyzed genetic and clinical data from more than 55,000 participants in four large-scale studies. Three of these -- the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, the Women's Genome Health Study, and the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study -- are prospective studies that have followed participants for up to 20 years. The fourth, the BioImage Study, assessed a variety of risk factors, including the presence of atherosclerotic plaques in the coronary arteries when participants joined the study. Each participant in the current analysis was assigned a genetic risk score, based on whether they carried any of 50 gene variants that previous studies associated with elevated heart attack risk. Based on data gathered when participants entered each study, the investigators used four AHA-defined lifestyle factors -- no current smoking; lack of obesity, defined as a body mass index less than 30; physical exercise at least once a week, and a healthy dietary pattern -- to determine a lifestyle score, whether participants had a favorable (three or four healthy factors), intermediate (two factors) or unfavorable (one or no healthy factors) lifestyle. For participants in the prospective studies, the research team investigated how each individual's genetic risk score and lifestyle factors related to the incidence of heart attack, the need for procedures designed to open blocked coronary arteries, or sudden cardiac death. Among participants in the BioImage study, genetic and lifestyle factors were compared to the extent of atherosclerotic disease in the coronary arteries at baseline. Across all three prospective studies, a higher genetic risk score significantly increased the incidence of coronary events -- as much as 90 percent in those at highest risk. While known risk factors such as a family history and elevated LDL cholesterol were also associated with an elevated genetic risk score, genetic risk was the most powerful contributor to cardiac risk. Similarly, each healthy lifestyle factor reduced risk, and the unfavorable lifestyle group also had higher levels of hypertension, diabetes and other known risk factors upon entering the studies. Within each genetic risk category, the presence of lifestyle factors significantly altered the risk of coronary events to such an extent that following a favorable lifestyle could reduce the incidence of coronary events by 50 percent in those with the highest genetic risk scores. Among participants in the BioImage study, both genetic and lifestyle factors were independently associated with levels of calcium-containing plaque in the coronary arteries, and healthy lifestyle factors were associated with less extensive plaque within each genetic risk group. "Some people may feel they cannot escape a genetically determined risk for heart attack, but our findings indicate that following a healthy lifestyle can powerfully reduce genetic risk," says Kathiresan, who is director of the Cardiovascular Disease Initiative at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and an associate professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. "Now we need to investigate whether specific lifestyle factors have stronger impacts and conduct studies in more diverse populations, since most of the participants in these studies are white." ### The lead authors of the NEJM paper are Amit Khera, MD, MGH Cardiology and Center for Human Genetic Research (CHGR), and Connor Emdin, DPhil, Broad Institute.

'Field of ankylosing spondylitis management has suddenly come alive' MedpageToday savesaved register today Earn Free CME Credits by reading the latest medical news in your specialty.sign up by Nancy Walsh Nancy Walsh Senior Staff Writer, MedPage Today November 13, 2016 Action Points Note that this study was published as an abstract and presented at a conference. These data and conclusions should be considered to be preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. Tofacitinib, an oral JAK inhibitor, demonstrated greater clinical and imaging efficacy than placebo in reducing the signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in adults with active AS. Note that tofacitinib inhibits signaling mechanisms in the cell that are relevant to inflammation, but we do not fully understand which signaling mechanisms may be particularly important in spondylitis. When the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors came on the scene in the late 1990s as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, the biologic revolution began, and a formerly crippling disease was transformed into one with a treatment goal of sustained remission. The TNF inhibitors were followed by multiple other biologics that target various inflammatory pathways, with modes of administration ranging from intravenous infusions and subcutaneous injections to oral tablets. The successes seen in rheumatoid arthritis were then followed by use of these medications in other conditions including inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and psoriatic arthritis. And more recently, "the field of ankylosing spondylitis [AS] management has suddenly come alive," Atul Deodhar, MD, of Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, told MedPage Today in an interview. For instance, earlier this year the interleukin 17A inhibitor secukinumab (Cosentyx) was approved for use in AS, while trials also are exploring the possibility of targeting the IL-12/23 pathways with ustekinumab (Stelara) and also the JAK-STAT pathway, with agents such as the JAK 1/3 inhibitor tofacitinib (Xeljanz). Tofacitinib in Phase II At this year's annual meeting of the European League Against Rheumatism, Desiree van der Heijde, MD, PhD, of the University of Leiden in the Netherlands, presented the results of a phase II dose-ranging study of tofacitinib in AS. The trial included 207 patients who were randomized to receive placebo or tofacitinib in dosages of 2, 5, or 10 mg twice daily for 12 weeks, with follow-up continuing to week 16. More than two-thirds of the patients were men, mean age was 42, and mean disease duration was 6.3 years. The mean Bath AS Disease Activity Index at baseline was 6.7. The primary endpoint of a 20% improvement in the Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society (ASAS20) response criteria at week 12 was met by 40.1% of the placebo group, 56% of the tofacitinib 2-mg group, 63% of the 5-mg group, and 67.4% of the 10-mg group. The increased rates compared with placebo were 15.8% (95% CI 11.1-19.9), 22.9% (95% CI 17.8-28), and 27.3% (95% CI 21.8-33). Benefits also were seen on secondary endpoints. For instance, the ASAS40 response rates were 19.6% in the placebo group, 42.3% in the 2-mg group (P<0.05), 46.2% in the 5-mg group (P<0.01), and 38.5% in the 10-mg group (P<0.01). The changes from baseline on the AS Disease Activity Score in the 2-, 5-, and 10-mg groups were -1.2 (P<0.01), -1.4 (P<0.001), and -1.4 (P<0.001), respectively, compared with -0.7 in the placebo group. On the Bath AS Functional Index (BASFI), the changes from baseline in the 2-, 5-, and 10-mg groups were -1.9, -2.4, and -2.2, respectively, which was a statistically significant difference from placebo in the two higher-dose groups (P<0.05). Imaging findings also showed benefits. On the Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada scores, significant changes were seen on MRI of the sacroiliac joints for the 5-mg and 10-mg groups (-3.2 and -3.6, P<0.05 for both) and also for MRI of the spine (-5.5 and -6.6, P<0.001 for both). "The changes on MRI were quite impressive and comparable to what we've seen with TNF inhibitors," said Walter Maksymowych, MD, of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, who participated in the study. "Our past experience has shown that a good MRI response usually indicates that there's going to be a good clinical response. They don't always correlate, but it's usually an indication that the therapeutic strategy is going to work," he said in an interview. No AS-specific safety concerns were noted in the study, although "in the 16-week time frame there really wasn't any opportunity to seriously explore adverse events," Maksymowych said. "It seems to be a well tolerated agent in both rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis," he said. The Outlook Tofacitinib inhibits signaling mechanisms in the cell that are relevant to inflammation, Maksymowych explained. "We do not fully understand which signaling mechanisms may be particularly important in spondylitis. That's still an area of investigation," he said. As to efficacy, "It's early days yet," he said. "When we look at some of the major clinical response measures, like ASAS40 and BASFI, it's actually fairly comparable to the TNF inhibitors. So I'd have to say it looks like a promising approach, because it's an oral drug, and we don't have a lot of options for the use of oral agents in this condition," he said. The JAK pathway should be explored further, he stated. "There's still very much an unmet need in spondylitis because only about 50% of patients have major clinical responses. It affects young people, and is a common disease, but we don't have disease-modifying therapies that can prevent the progression of the ankylosis," Maksymowych said. "So there are still a lot of major challenges in this condition that have been overcome in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and to some degree in psoriatic arthritis," he said. However, the unmet needs in AS may persist. "I believe Pfizer will not pursue the indication," predicted John J. Cush, MD, of Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas. "This is largely because of disappointing results and crowded competition. They also are having trouble getting approval for psoriasis. If they can't get psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis approval, then AS isn't worth it -- not in this era of IL-17 drugs, IL-12/23, and IL-23 looming," Cush told MedPage Today.

Skip to content Military Technologies Military Press Releases Xencor Presents Preliminary Data from an Ongoing, Open-label, Phase 2 Study of XmAb®5871 in IgG4-Related Disease (IgG4-RD) at the American College of Rheumatology 2016 Annual Meeting “I am impressed by the steady ‘dialing down’ of the inflammatory response that XmAb5871 seems to exert in IgG4-RD and believe it is a promising potential therapy,” said Dr. John H. Stone, the principal investigator of the study. “We are learning a lot about how to study this disease in the context of this small trial.” As of a data cutoff of October 31, 2016, 12 patients with active IgG4-RD have been enrolled and dosed with XmAb5871 (median number of infusions = 7, range 1-12). Patients had a median IgG4-RD RI of 10 (range 2-30) with a median of four organs involved (range 1-10) at the time of study entry. Organ site involvement occurring at a frequency of greater than or equal to 50% included lymph nodes, submandibular glands, parotid glands and lacrimal glands. Preliminary Safety Data: Every other week intravenous administration of XmAb5871 has been well tolerated. As of October 31, 2016, no serious adverse events (AEs) have been reported. Treatment related AEs have occurred in five patients (42%). Treatment-related AEs that occurred in more than one patient were abdominal pain/discomfort in three patients (25%), occurring as part of Grade 1 (mild) infusion-related gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea and/or vomiting and/or diarrhea) during the first infusion, and Grade 1 (mild) headache in two patients (16.7%). One patient discontinued the study as the result of an AE. The patient developed a Grade 2 (moderate) hypersensitivity reaction with rash and arthritis, commonly referred to as serum sickness, following the fifth infusion. The event resolved quickly without the need for medical management. This patient was subsequently found to have developed anti-drug antibodies. Preliminary Efficacy Data: Eleven of the 12 patients dosed with XmAb5871 have had at least one IgG4-RD RI performed following dosing as of the data cutoff date. Nine of 11 patients (82%) have had an initial response to XmAb5871 therapy of at least a three-point reduction in the IgG4-RD RI within two weeks of the first dose. Five patients attained disease remission (an IgG4-RD RI of 0) during the study. Two patients entering the study on corticosteroids have been able to taper and discontinue steroid use during the study. In addition to the patient with early study termination due to an AE, two other patients have discontinued treatment prior to receipt of all 12 planned infusions. One patient had a response to therapy (IgG4-RD RI reduction of six points), but lost response following the sixth infusion, at which point this patient discontinued treatment. One patient had no response to therapy as defined by a greater than or equal to two-point decrease in the IgG4-RD RI. This patient had an atypical presentation of larynx involvement as the only organ involved. The patient discontinued the study after six infusions. Neither of these two patients have responded to subsequent rituximab treatment. The slide presentation will be available at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time today on the ‘Investors’ page of Xencor’s website under ‘Events and Presentations’ at www.xencor.com. Conference Call Information Xencor management will host a conference call and webcast today at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss data presented today. The live call may be accessed by dialing (877) 359-9508 for domestic callers or (224) 357-2393 for international callers, and providing the conference ID number 16658995. A live webcast of the conference call will be available online from the investors section of the Xencor website at www.xencor.com. The webcast will be archived on the Company’s website for 30 days. About XmAb®5871-03   XmAb5871-03 is an open-label, single-arm study of up to 15 patients with histopathologically proven IgG4-RD with active disease as defined by disease activity in one or more organ systems and an IgG4-RD RI of greater than or equal to three. Participants will receive XmAb5871 by intravenous infusion every other week for up to a total of 12 infusions. Primary and secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of every other week intravenous administration of XmAb5871 on the IgG4-RD RI in patients with active IgG4-RD and to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of XmAb5871 in patients with active IgG4-RD over an up to six-month period. The primary endpoint of the completed study will be the proportion of patients on Day 169 with an improvement of disease activity score as defined by a decrease of IgG4-RD RI of greater than or equal to two points from the Day 1 pre-dose disease activity score. About XmAb®5871    XmAb®5871 is a first-in-class monoclonal antibody that targets CD19 with its variable domain and that uses Xencor’s XmAb immune inhibitor Fc domain to target FcγRIIb, a receptor that inhibits B-cell function. XmAb5871 is the first drug candidate that Xencor is aware of that targets FcγRIIb inhibition. Xencor has demonstrated in multiple animal models and in initial human clinical trials that XmAb5871 inhibits B-cell function without destroying these important immune cells, and demonstrated promising treatment effect in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, as well as ex vivo results showing inhibition of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patient B-cell activation and humoral immunity. Complete data results from a Phase 1b/2a study of XmAb5871 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis were presented at the American College of Rheumatology 2015 Annual Meeting as well as at the EULAR 2015 Annual Meeting. Ex vivo studies of SLE patient B cells were published in Journal of Immunology, 2011, 186(7):4223. About IgG4-Related Disease  IgG4-Related Disease (IgG4-RD) is a rare fibro-inflammatory autoimmune disorder that is estimated to impact up to 40,000 patients in the United States. IgG4-RD affects multiple organ systems and is characterized by a distinct microscopic appearance of diseased organs, including the presence of IgG4-positive plasmablast cells. This objective diagnostic criterion is atypical for autoimmune diseases and offers advantages for accurately identifying patients. There are currently no approved therapies for this newly recognized disorder and corticosteroids are the current standard of care. John H. Stone, M.D, MPH, director, clinical rheumatology at Massachusetts General Hospital has developed and is validating the IgG4-RD Responder Index (RI), a proposed instrument to assess disease activity. About Xencor’s XmAb® Immune Inhibitor Technology FcγRIIb (IIb), also called CD32b, is a receptor for Fc domains on B cells and other immune cells. When engaged, the IIb receptor blocks immune activation pathways and traffics bound soluble antigens out of circulation. Xencor has discovered a series of Fc domain variants with up to a 400-fold increase in binding affinity to FcγRIIb derived from just two amino acid changes. These XmAb® Immune Inhibitor Fc domains greatly heighten the properties of IIb receptor engagement and have potential as building blocks for drug candidates in autoimmune, allergic and inflammatory diseases. About Xencor, Inc. Xencor is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing engineered monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, asthma and allergic diseases and cancer. Currently, 10 candidates engineered with Xencor’s XmAb® technology are in clinical development internally and with partners.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Xencor Presents Preliminary Data from an Ongoing, Open-label, Phase 2 Study of XmAb®5871 in IgG4-Related Disease (IgG4-RD) at the American College of Rheumatology 2016 Annual Meeting MONROVIA, Calif., Nov. 13, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — Xencor, Inc. (NASDAQ: XNCR), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing engineered monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, asthma and allergic diseases and cancer, today announced preliminary data from XmAb5871-03, an ongoing, open-label, pilot Phase 2 study of XmAb5871 in patients with active IgG4- RD. Data show that 82% of patients achieved an initial response to therapy within two weeks of their first dose. The data are being presented by John H. Stone, M.D., MPH, director of rheumatology at Massachusetts General Hospital, at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 2016 Annual Meeting in the Miscellaneous Rheumatic and Inflammatory Disease session on Sunday, November 13, 2016 (today) at 2:45 p.m. EST. “We are very encouraged by the rapid initial response in IgG4-RD disease activity observed in this preliminary data set, in which nine of the 11 patients evaluated for IgG4-RD Responder Index (RI) post-treatment achieved a response within two weeks of their first dose, with responses typically deepening over time,” said Paul Foster, M.D., chief medical officer of Xencor. “We expect to report complete study results in 2017.” “I am impressed by the steady ‘dialing down’ of the inflammatory response that XmAb5871 seems to exert in IgG4-RD and believe it is a promising potential therapy,” said Dr. John H. Stone, the principal investigator of the study. “We are learning a lot about how to study this disease in the context of this small trial.” As of a data cutoff of October 31, 2016, 12 patients with active IgG4-RD have been enrolled and dosed with XmAb5871 (median number of infusions = 7, range 1-12). Patients had a median IgG4-RD RI of 10 (range 2-30) with a median of four organs involved (range 1-10) at the time of study entry. Organ site involvement occurring at a frequency of greater than or equal to 50% included lymph nodes, submandibular glands, parotid glands and lacrimal glands. Preliminary Safety Data: Every other week intravenous administration of XmAb5871 has been well tolerated. As of October 31, 2016, no serious adverse events (AEs) have been reported. Treatment related AEs have occurred in five patients (42%). Treatment-related AEs that occurred in more than one patient were abdominal pain/discomfort in three patients (25%), occurring as part of Grade 1 (mild) infusion-related gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea and/or vomiting and/or diarrhea) during the first infusion, and Grade 1 (mild) headache in two patients (16.7%). One patient discontinued the study as the result of an AE. The patient developed a Grade 2 (moderate) hypersensitivity reaction with rash and arthritis, commonly referred to as serum sickness, following the fifth infusion. The event resolved quickly without the need for medical management. This patient was subsequently found to have developed anti-drug antibodies. Preliminary Efficacy Data: Eleven of the 12 patients dosed with XmAb5871 have had at least one IgG4-RD RI performed following dosing as of the data cutoff date. Nine of 11 patients (82%) have had an initial response to XmAb5871 therapy of at least a three-point reduction in the IgG4-RD RI within two weeks of the first dose. Five patients attained disease remission (an IgG4-RD RI of 0) during the study. Two patients entering the study on corticosteroids have been able to taper and discontinue steroid use during the study. In addition to the patient with early study termination due to an AE, two other patients have discontinued treatment prior to receipt of all 12 planned infusions. One patient had a response to therapy (IgG4-RD RI reduction of six points), but lost response following the sixth infusion, at which point this patient discontinued treatment. One patient had no response to therapy as defined by a greater than or equal to two-point decrease in the IgG4-RD RI. This patient had an atypical presentation of larynx involvement as the only organ involved. The patient discontinued the study after six infusions. Neither of these two patients have responded to subsequent rituximab treatment. The slide presentation will be available at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time today on the ‘Investors’ page of Xencor’s website under ‘Events and Presentations’ at www.xencor.com. Conference Call Information Xencor management will host a conference call and webcast today at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss data presented today. The live call may be accessed by dialing (877) 359-9508 for domestic callers or (224) 357-2393 for international callers, and providing the conference ID number 16658995. A live webcast of the conference call will be available online from the investors section of the Xencor website at www.xencor.com. The webcast will be archived on the Company’s website for 30 days. About XmAb®5871-03   XmAb5871-03 is an open-label, single-arm study of up to 15 patients with histopathologically proven IgG4-RD with active disease as defined by disease activity in one or more organ systems and an IgG4-RD RI of greater than or equal to three. Participants will receive XmAb5871 by intravenous infusion every other week for up to a total of 12 infusions. Primary and secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of every other week intravenous administration of XmAb5871 on the IgG4-RD RI in patients with active IgG4-RD and to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of XmAb5871 in patients with active IgG4-RD over an up to six-month period. The primary endpoint of the completed study will be the proportion of patients on Day 169 with an improvement of disease activity score as defined by a decrease of IgG4-RD RI of greater than or equal to two points from the Day 1 pre-dose disease activity score. About XmAb®5871    XmAb®5871 is a first-in-class monoclonal antibody that targets CD19 with its variable domain and that uses Xencor’s XmAb immune inhibitor Fc domain to target FcγRIIb, a receptor that inhibits B-cell function. XmAb5871 is the first drug candidate that Xencor is aware of that targets FcγRIIb inhibition. Xencor has demonstrated in multiple animal models and in initial human clinical trials that XmAb5871 inhibits B-cell function without destroying these important immune cells, and demonstrated promising treatment effect in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, as well as ex vivo results showing inhibition of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patient B-cell activation and humoral immunity. Complete data results from a Phase 1b/2a study of XmAb5871 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis were presented at the American College of Rheumatology 2015 Annual Meeting as well as at the EULAR 2015 Annual Meeting. Ex vivo studies of SLE patient B cells were published in Journal of Immunology, 2011, 186(7):4223. About IgG4-Related Disease  IgG4-Related Disease (IgG4-RD) is a rare fibro-inflammatory autoimmune disorder that is estimated to impact up to 40,000 patients in the United States. IgG4-RD affects multiple organ systems and is characterized by a distinct microscopic appearance of diseased organs, including the presence of IgG4-positive plasmablast cells. This objective diagnostic criterion is atypical for autoimmune diseases and offers advantages for accurately identifying patients. There are currently no approved therapies for this newly recognized disorder and corticosteroids are the current standard of care. John H. Stone, M.D, MPH, director, clinical rheumatology at Massachusetts General Hospital has developed and is validating the IgG4-RD Responder Index (RI), a proposed instrument to assess disease activity. About Xencor’s XmAb® Immune Inhibitor Technology FcγRIIb (IIb), also called CD32b, is a receptor for Fc domains on B cells and other immune cells. When engaged, the IIb receptor blocks immune activation pathways and traffics bound soluble antigens out of circulation. Xencor has discovered a series of Fc domain variants with up to a 400-fold increase in binding affinity to FcγRIIb derived from just two amino acid changes. These XmAb® Immune Inhibitor Fc domains greatly heighten the properties of IIb receptor engagement and have potential as building blocks for drug candidates in autoimmune, allergic and inflammatory diseases. About Xencor, Inc. Xencor is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing engineered monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, asthma and allergic diseases and cancer. Currently, 10 candidates engineered with Xencor’s XmAb® technology are in clinical development internally and with partners.

This is the fifth installment. -- Ed. Faced with the continued slowdown of its manufacturing sector, South Korea is eyeing new growth in the field of biotechnology, a promising industry expected for a sharp growth in the years ahead. Biotechnology broadly refers to the use of genetic engineering and molecular biology to modify living cells to produce novel substances that perform new functions. Its biggest applications are in “red biotechnology” -- the development of complex drugs based on living cells, proteins, blood components and other biochemicals. The Korean government has set medical biotechnology, particularly new drug development, as a key priority, investing 2.38 trillion won in the local biotech sector in 2015, according to the Korea Biotechnology Industry Organization. (123RF) Despite its potential, experts say Korea’s biotech sector faces many hurdles to growth, including risks and failures associated with new drug development, immense costs of research and development as well as insufficient workforce trained in the life sciences. Korea was recently reminded of the difficulties of new drug development through a case involving Hanmi Pharmaceutical, a pioneering local drugmaker that has successfully developed multiple new drugs and licensed them out to global pharmaceutical firms. In September, Hanmi announced that its partner Boehringer Ingelheim terminated a $730 million licensing deal it had entered with Hanmi over a new lung cancer therapy back in July 2015, after a patient died of the drug’s side effects during the drug’s phase 2 clinical trials overseas. Hanmi’s shares plunged by more than 18 percent on the day of the announcement. In addition to the apparent financial losses, the incident served as a humble reminder to Korean investors and the public of just how difficult it is to develop a new, safe and effective drug that can be approved and brought to the market. “Hanmi’s case sheds light on the immense difficulties of new drug development,” Shinhan Investment & Securities analyst Bae Ki-dal said in a research note on Hanmi’s setback. According to a June 2016 report by the US Food & Drug Administration on clinical success rates, there is only a 9.6 percent likelihood that a new drug in phase 1 clinical trials will be approved for sale. The figure is just slightly higher, 15.3 percent, for drugs in phase 2 trials. Moreover, a majority of developing drugs do not advance to the final clinical trial stage. Only 30.7 percent of developmental drug candidates in phase 2 trials advance to phase 3, according to the FDA’s report. In other words, new drug development demands immense time, R&D, money and patience. It is “a game of probability with low chances of clinical development success,” as described by Eugene Investment & Securities analyst Kwak Jin-hee. Given the high costs and difficulties of new drug development, some Korean firms have chosen to embark on the medical biotech business from a different entry point. For instance, Samsung BioLogics is pursuing the contract drug manufacturing business -- making drugs on behalf of other biopharma firms -- while Celltrion and Samsung Bioepis are developing biosimilars -- cheaper, near-replicas of expensive biologic drugs that have lost patent protection. However, whether it is new drug development or the production of existing biologic drugs and biosimilars, industry insiders agree on a key problem -- the lack of skilled employees specialized in the life sciences and biopharma production. A 2015 KBIO survey of biotech companies on the current state of the biotech workforce showed that 37.6 percent of companies feel that there is a shortage of applicants with the right, needed skills and 33.9 percent said that applicants lack the right level of experience needed for a given position. Eyeing this need, local universities and multinational companies have recently begun to take action, albeit on a small scale. It remains to be seen whether these efforts will help nurture Korea’s biotech workforce. Last month, GE Healthcare and German life sciences firm Merck opened a new training center in Incheon’s Songdo district to provide technical assistance to companies looking to develop and produce new biologic drugs and technologies. Throughout this year, Korean universities such as Incheon National University, Hanyang University, Dongguk University and Konkuk University have launched new academic programs focusing on field-based medical biotechnology such as biopharma production, product quality management, clinical trials as well as marketing and sales.
