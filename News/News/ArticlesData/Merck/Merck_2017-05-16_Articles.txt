Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 16 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Merck to Present New Phase 3 Data on Investigational Ertugliflozin, Additional Analyses of Studies of JANUVIA® (sitagliptin), and Real-World Evidence Research at the 77th Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that 19 scientific presentations from Merck’s diabetes pipeline and portfolio – including Phase 3 data for investigational ertugliflozin, additional analyses of JANUVIA® (sitagliptin), and real-world research – will be presented at the 77th Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) in San Diego, June 9-13, 2017.

Indications and Usage for JANUVIA (sitagliptin) 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg tablets JANUVIA is indicated, as an adjunct to diet and exercise, to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. JANUVIA should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. JANUVIA has not been studied in patients with a history of pancreatitis. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk of developing pancreatitis while taking JANUVIA. Selected Important Risk Information about JANUVIA JANUVIA is contraindicated in patients with a history of a serious hypersensitivity reaction to sitagliptin, such as anaphylaxis or angioedema. There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and nonfatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, in patients taking JANUVIA. After initiating JANUVIA, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue JANUVIA and initiate appropriate management. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk of developing pancreatitis while taking JANUVIA. Assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiating JANUVIA (sitagliptin) and periodically thereafter. A dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal insufficiency and in patients with end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Caution should be used to ensure that the correct dose of JANUVIA is prescribed. There have been postmarketing reports of worsening renal function, including acute renal failure, sometimes requiring dialysis. A subset of these reports involved patients with renal insufficiency, some of whom were prescribed inappropriate doses of sitagliptin. When JANUVIA was used in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin, medications known to cause hypoglycemia, the incidence of hypoglycemia was increased over that of placebo. Therefore, a lower dose of sulfonylurea or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. The incidence (and rate) of hypoglycemia based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia were: 12.2% (0.59 episodes/patient-year) for JANUVIA 100 mg in combination with glimepiride (with or without metformin), 1.8% (0.24 episodes/patient-year) for placebo in combination with glimepiride (with or without metformin), 15.5% (1.06 episodes/patient-year) for JANUVIA 100 mg in combination with insulin (with or without metformin), and 7.8% (0.51 episodes/patient-year) for placebo in combination with insulin (with or without metformin). There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA, such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens –Johnson syndrome. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with JANUVIA, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue JANUVIA, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes. Angioedema has also been reported with other dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema with another DPP-4 inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with JANUVIA. There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from 1 day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving JANUVIA (sitagliptin). If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, JANUVIA should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment. There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with JANUVIA or with any other antidiabetic drug. In clinical studies, the adverse reactions reported, regardless of investigator assessment of causality, in ≥5% of patients treated with JANUVIA as monotherapy and in combination therapy and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo, were upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, and headache.

ComVoices is pleased to learn that no personal data was mistakenly released but the report details a series of mistakes and inadequacy. ComVoices chair Brenda Pilott said that these errors were symptomatic of the implementation of this project to require community providers to collect and share personal information with MSD. “We have said from the outset that this process was being rushed and was not affording MSD time to consider all the issues. Nor have they engaged well with providers and other experts.” ComVoices has consistently advised the department and Minister to slow down. “The timeframe for this project was self-imposed and coincided with a period of major restructuring within MSD. No wonder mistakes were made”, said Brenda Pilott. “The Privacy Commissioner made four recommendations to MSD and its Minister, of which data security was just one. The other recommendations have not been addressed yet. Privacy considerations must be looked at carefully. Neither we nor MSD can give providers any reassurance that they can provide this sensitive data to MSD with full trust and confidence.” Brenda Pilott said: “My message to MSD is to slow down and to engage with provider groups in a co-design process. This is too important to get wrong again.” © Scoop Media   Tweet         Parliament Headlines | Politics Headlines | Regional Headlines NEW ZEALAND POLITICS Silver Fern Farms: Proposal To Close Fairton Sheepmeat Plant Silver Fern Farms has advised its people of the proposal to permanently close the site, and has discussed potential transfer options to its other sites in the region as part of the consultation process...

The settlement, disclosed in papers filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey on Monday, came in a class action filed in 2001 arising out of a settlement in patent litigation between Upsher-Smith and Schering-Plough Corp, now owned by Merck. That patent deal, plaintiffs in the antitrust class action said, was an example of a "pay-for-delay" settlement, in which brand-name drug makers pay generic companies to keep their products off the market for a longer period. Both companies continued to deny wrongdoing as part of the settlement, according to court papers. The settlement is subject to court approval. Neither Merck nor Upsher-Smith immediately responded to requests for comment on Tuesday. The lawsuit stemmed from a settlement between the companies in 1998 that resolved patent litigation in which Schering-Plough sought to block Upsher-Smith from marketing a planned generic version of K-Dur until a patent expired in 2006. Under that settlement, Upsher-Smith agreed not to market a generic version before 2001, at which point Schering would grant it a license, and Schering agreed to pay Upsher-Smith at least $60 million, according to court papers. The class action lawsuit, by direct purchasers of K-Dur including drug wholesalers and hospitals, said the companies violated antitrust laws through the unlawful delay of generic K-Dur. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission had also sued Schering-Plough in 2011 over payments to rivals to delay generic versions of K-Dur. The FTC ultimately lost that case. The case is In re K-Dur Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey, No. 01-cv-01652.

We stand ready to support the DRC Government in its fight against Ebola.” An agreement between Gavi and Merck, the developer of the Ebola vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV, ensures that the vaccine is available in case of an outbreak. The WHO and others will determine if and when deployment of vaccine into this outbreak is warranted. An agreement between Gavi and Merck, the developer of the Ebola vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV, ensures that the vaccine is available in case of an outbreak. The WHO and others will determine if and when deployment of vaccine into this outbreak is warranted. “Gavi’s work with Merck means there are 300,000 doses of Ebola vaccine available if needed to stop this outbreak becoming a pandemic,” Dr Seth Berkley confirmed. “The vaccine has shown high efficacy in clinical trials and could play a vital role in protecting the most vulnerable.” In January 2016, Gavi announced an Advance Purchase Commitment with Merck, committing US$ 5 million towards the eventual procurement of a vaccine once it is licensed, prequalified and WHO-recommended. As part of this commitment Merck agreed to create and store a stockpile of 300,000 doses in case of an outbreak while full licensure was secured. The DRC outbreak has been identified as the Zaire strain of Ebola, which is targeted by rVSV-ZEBOV.

THISDAY checks revealed that the screening of passengers began on Sunday, in order to avert a repeat of the 2014 scenario when a Liberian national infected with the Ebola virus flew into the country undetected, resulting in the infection of 20 persons and nine deaths. According to the acting General Manager, Corporate Affairs, Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), Henrietta Yakubu, “We have started the screening of passengers coming into the country. The move is to prevent any unforeseen circumstances. “The moment they arrive, we give them forms to fill. Before then, they go through the thermal scanner being installed by the Port Health Services.” Yakubu explained that if FAAN is not vigilant, it won’t be able to detect possible carriers of the disease and “you won’t know that they are there”. “The moment you pass through and your temperature is more than 38 degrees, you will be pulled aside and handed over to health personnel for further checks,” she said. She disclosed that with the assistance of the Port Help Services and the Federal Ministry of Health, the screening of passengers would be extended to the domestic wings of all airports in the country. But as Nigeria stepped up screening at entry points into the country, WHO on Monday confirmed that a second Ebola case had been detected in the DRC. “So far, there are 19 suspected cases, including three deaths and two lab-confirmed cases,” a WHO spokesperson in Geneva said via e-mail. The first case was confirmed on Friday in Bas-Uele province in the north-east of the country. WHO has said the outbreak appears to be limited to that remote area, and that there was no need for travel restrictions for the time being. The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, a continent-wide mechanism set up to monitor disease outbreaks, said it had activated its emergency operational centre to monitor the situation in DRC, reported the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). The Central African country has suffered seven previous outbreaks of Ebola since the virus was discovered in the country in 1976. The last outbreak in 2014 left 49 people dead. The haemorrhagic fever has been most detrimental in West Africa, where it claimed more than 11,000 lives in 2014 to 2015. WHO declared Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the three countries that had been most effected by the epidemic, free of Ebola in 2016. GAVI global vaccine alliance said on Friday that some 300,000 emergency doses of an Ebola vaccine developed by Merck could be available in case of a large-scale outbreak, after WHO confirmed a fatal case in Congo. The vaccine, known as “rVSV-ZEBOV”, was shown to be highly protective against Ebola in clinical trials published in December 2016. On December 23, 2016, an experimental Ebola vaccine was highly protective against the deadly virus in a major trial in Guinea, according to results published in The Lancet. The vaccine is the first to prevent infection from one of the most lethal known pathogens, and the findings add weight to early trial results published in 2016. The vaccine was studied in a trial involving 11,841 people in Guinea in 2015. Among the 5,837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination. In comparison, there were 23 cases 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine. The trial was led by WHO, together with Guinea’s Ministry of Health, Medecins sans Frontieres and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, in collaboration with other international partners. “While these compelling results is coming too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa’s Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless,” said Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO’s Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation, and the study’s lead author. The vaccine’s manufacturer, Merck, Sharpe & Dohme, this year received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and PRIME status from the European Medicines Agency, enabling faster regulatory review of the vaccine once it is submitted. Since Ebola virus was first identified in 1976, sporadic outbreaks have been reported in Africa. The 2013–2016 West African Ebola outbreak, which resulted in more than 11,300 deaths, highlighted the need for a vaccine. The trial took place in the coastal region of Basse-Guinée, the area of Guinea still experiencing new Ebola cases when the trial started in 2015. The trial used an innovative design, a so-called “ring vaccination” approach, the same method used to eradicate small pox. When a new Ebola case was diagnosed, the research team traced all people who may have been in contact with that case within the previous three weeks, such as people who lived in the same household, were visited by the patient, or were in close contact with the patient, their clothes or linen, as well as certain “contacts of contacts”. A total of 117 clusters (or “rings”) were identified, each made up of an average of 80 people. Meanwhile, the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) has called on the federal government to prepare a strong response to the recent outbreak of the virus in the DRC. The NMA in a statement issued on Monday by its President, Dr. Mike Ogirima, and National Secretary, Yusuf Tanko Sununu, called for vigilance, saying the recent outbreak of Ebola in the DRC was another major setback for the world. According to the medical body, “The devastation brought by the last outbreak still remains fresh in our minds,” noting that “West Africa was the worst affected with more than 11,000 deaths recorded in the Ebola outbreak in 2014-2015, mainly in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. “Efforts by the Government of Federal Republic of Nigeria have been acclaimed as one of the best moments the country demonstrated – that where there is political will, success is assured. “The role of our fallen heroes especially the late Dr. Stella Adadevoh in the control of the spread of the disease is not only worth remembering but reminds us of the need to make sacrifices for our country.” Against this backdrop, NMA called on the federal government to remain vigilant, strengthen its response team, borders and other international routes of entry surveillance. The association said it was ready to partner with the Ministry of Health to achieve another resounding success in the prevention and control of this fresh outbreak. “We also wish to call on all health teams to refresh their knowledge on the clinical presentation of Ebola, apply universal basic precautions in patients’ care and use the standard protocols of management and reporting of suspected cases. “The NMA also wishes to call on Nigerians not to panic and to cooperate with government in securing our nation, especially during surveillance at entry points if the need arises,” the body said. The NMA also assured all Nigerians of the readiness of its members to do more to safeguard the health of the nation.

"The side effects are real bad," he said, but the medication is effective. by Don Sapatkin, Inquirer Staff Writer Close icon Don Sapatkin Inquirer Staff Writer Roughly two million to three million baby boomers are chronically infected with hepatitis C, putting them at risk of serious liver damage if left untreated. Dramatic improvements in what is now a very unpleasant drug regimen are expected over the next several years. Should they wait? Before deciding that this story doesn't apply to you, note that chronic hepatitis C can lie dormant for decades with no symptoms. Most people who have it are unaware of the infection. So the first step is to get a blood test, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last month proposed recommending for everyone born from 1945 to 1965. If it's positive, the short answer about what to do next is - sorry - ask your doctor. People with significant liver disease need to be treated now while others may have reason to hold off. But physicians say that complexities of the condition, other medical issues, classes of drugs and their side effects mean that patients should not attempt to choose on their own. "This is a rapidly evolving field," said Rajender Reddy, director of hepatology for the University of Pennsylvania Health System, where about a dozen different drug combinations are in clinical trials. Baby boomers account for more than 75 percent of Americans infected with the blood-borne virus. That's partly because transfusions and blood products weren't screened until 1992 but mostly due to drug use with shared needles, even just once or twice, as teenagers or young adults. After years of chronic infection, more and more people are arriving at hepatologists' offices with advanced liver disease, which also makes the underlying virus harder to suppress. But there have been plenty of reasons to avoid treatment. The longtime standard regimen - weekly injections of immune-boosting pegylated interferon plus twice-daily ribavirin pills - takes 48 weeks, causes nasty side effects, and works less than 50 percent of the time. In May 2011, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first changes in a decade: adding to the standard either Merck's Victrelis (also called boceprevir) or Vertex Pharmaceuticals' Incivek (telaprevir). The direct-acting antivirals nearly doubled the percentage of patients whose virus was reduced to undetectable levels, essentially a cure. In the case of telaprevir, the duration of treatment for some patients was cut to 24 weeks or less. "They work well but many people either can't take them because of contraindications like depression or won't take them because of the side effects," said Mark Sulkowski, medical director of the Viral Hepatitis center at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, whose data on the next generation of drugs energized a conference in Barcelona, Spain, two months ago. Side effects, mostly from the interferon, include fatigue, flu-like symptoms, personality changes, sleep disturbances, and on and on. People with severe depression or anemia, autoimmune diseases, and decompensated cirrhosis are ineligible. So are the 25 percent of infected people in this country whose virus is not genotype 1. Hep C was not a big surprise for Samuel Morales, 55. He'd used heroin for much of his life and also has hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and HIV, all of which are more easily treated than hep C (there are vaccines against A and B). They often run together in high-risk groups like prisoners. Morales said he got clean in prison in 1993. The hepatitis infections were discovered when he got a liver biopsy around 2000. Because the treatments then were not very effective, he said, his doctor suggested he wait for something better. His genotype 2 infection, which is more common among intravenous drug users, ruled out the drugs approved last year. A biopsy several months ago that showed worsening cirrhosis - he has never felt symptoms - led his doctor to urge treatment with the old drugs now. "The side effects are real bad. You get depressed, you don't eat, you get diarrhea, you get cold, you get hot, like a woman going through PMS, it is really bad. Your joints, they hurt, you know," said Morales. His infectious-disease doctor at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center required weekly sessions with a therapist and monthly with a psychiatrist, who prescribed Celexa to manage depression. "But when you get the results back from the blood work and you see your body viral load is down to 'undetected,' it is worth all that struggle," said Morales, who is three months into what is likely to be nearly a yearlong course of treatment. He has been volunteering with organizations near his North Philadelphia home, encouraging people to get tested for hepatitis C. Many of those who are positive will have more options than he did. Dozens of drugs are in development, and researchers expect several to reach the market within two to five years. The first, like the two drugs approved last year, will probably be protease inhibitors for genotype 1; they will still require shots of interferon to help the immune system fight the virus. After that, however, are several drugs that in small trials have been powerful enough to work without the immune system booster, and with far fewer side effects. Like the drug "cocktails" used to treat HIV, these are given in combination, disrupting the virus' life cycle at different points, so that it cannot mutate and replicate. The most promising results presented at a recent liver conference in Barcelona were from a combination of GS-7977, a polymerase inhibitor owned by Gilead Sciences Inc., and daclatasivir, a Bristol-Myers Squibb drug that is part of a class known as NS5A inhibitors. One pill a day of each drove the virus to undetectable levels in all 29 patients with genotype 1, the most common in the U.S., and 28 out of 30 patients with genotypes 2 and 3. That finding, while dramatic, was just four weeks after a 24-week course of treatment (a 12-week course is being tested as well). Because of relapses, doctors don't normally consider a patient cured until 12 to 24 weeks after completion. But they are a sign of the future. Reddy, who is medical director of Penn's liver transplant program, said that deciding whether to get treated with the older drugs now or wait for a future generation is a balancing act. When a biopsy shows significant liver disease, "we say 'hey, you've got to get treated.' But if a patient has relatively mild disease," he said, the ordeal of current treatments may tip the scale. "The side effects are not easy to handle if you don't have a support system." Reddy was involved with trials of both drugs approved last year and is currently testing the most promising new drugs and others in various combinations in people infected with different genotypes who have failed previous treatments and in others who have never tried them. The complexity of the treatments, along with rising numbers of people who need them, have led the Penn, Temple and Jefferson health systems to create viral hepatitis centers, with others likely soon. Because these centers also run clinical trials, some patients who are weighing approved drugs now vs. later may have a third choice. "It's a good time to come out of the woodwork, get your diagnosis and get treated," said Jonathan Fenkel, director of the Hepatitis C Center at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital.   Coming Monday Researchers who are seeking to unravel the mysteries of aging have yet to find the legendary fountain of youth, but they have uncovered intriguing clues to living longer, healthier lives.

(Graphic: Business Wire) Download Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail ???pagination.previous??? ???pagination.next??? Technavio has published a new report on the global single-use bioprocessing system market from 2017-2021. (Graphic: Business Wire) Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail May 16, 2017 07:03 PM Eastern Daylight Time LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Technavio analysts forecast the global single-use bioprocessing systems market to grow at a CAGR of almost 8% during the forecast period, according to their latest report. The research study covers the present scenario and growth prospects of the global single-use bioprocessing systems market for 2017-2021. The market is segmented based on application (mAB production, vaccine production, plant cell cultivation, PSCTs, others), product type (bags and mixers, bioreactors and fermenters, filtration devices and sampling systems, bioprocess containers, and tubing), and end-user (pharmaceutical companies, CROs and CMOs, biotechnology companies, academic and research institutions). The market is further segmented based on geography (Americas, EMEA, and APAC). The global market for single-use bioprocessing systems was estimated at USD 3.67 billion in 2016 and is expected to grow moderately during the forecast period. The competition in the market is very high as the five key vendors, namely Sartorius, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Merck, Danaher, and GE Healthcare, occupy the major share of the market. Some of the reasons for the high adoption rates of single-use systems in biopharma manufacturing are reduced cost (manufacturing and set-up), increased flexibility (multiple productions), and quicker time to market. The emergence of disposable products such as the tangential flow filtration (TFF) devices in downstream applications and the importance of single-use technology in aiding continuous bioprocessing will boost the market demand for the global single-use bioprocessing system. Looking for more information on this market? Request a free sample report Technavio’s sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. Technavio analysts highlight the following three factors that are contributing to the growth of the global single-use bioprocessing systems market: SUT combats global drug shortage problem Increasing M&As Rise in production of affordable biologics SUT combats global drug shortage problem The biopharmaceutical industry is shifting toward single-use technology (SUTs) to combat the global drug shortage. The increasing evidence of sterility, along with regulatory organizations encouraging pharma companies to switch to single-use technologies, hints toward a transition. Companies that have integrated and shifted toward a single-use system have expressed their satisfaction regarding lower costs, reduced overall contamination rates, and enhanced production throughput efficiency. Companies spend lesser time with disassembly and clean-up of the system while using SUTs, which results in quicker turnaround time for new batches of medications. Amber Chourasia, a lead lab equipment research analyst at Technavio, says, “Single-use technology is gaining popularity as it is the most cost-efficient solution to increase rapidity in drug development, support larger batches of production, and achieve a quicker time to market the solutions.” Increasing M&As The market has witnessed intense activities in the single-use bioprocessing systems in terms of M&As. Small companies are acquired by the vendors with greater market share to boost their production and increase their product offerings or simply set up shop in the emerging markets and tap into the ever-increasing demand. “M&As support the strong financial growth of the key vendors, and this will continue to drive demand in the market as M&As would be a prevalent theme for key vendors looking to increase their market and develop their revenue generating assets,” asserts Amber. Rise in production of affordable biologics Increasing competition in new therapy areas and the launch of biosimilars have increased the demand and put pressure on manufacturers to produce at a lower cost and in lesser time. According to estimates, the global market for biologics is over USD 180 billion and represents a share of 15%-20% of the overall pharmaceuticals market. The technological advances in single-use process and facilities will aid in the reduction of drug substance manufacturing costs. Downstream processing improvements and chromatography resins make up a large portion of the costs. Therefore, changing a polishing step from resin chromatography to an SU membrane column can significantly reduce expenses. Several research studies have indicated that after using SUTs, unit operation cost is reduced by 20%-30% compared with traditional manufacturing practices.

Rise in production of affordable biologics Increasing competition in new therapy areas and the launch of biosimilars have increased the demand and put pressure on manufacturers to produce at a lower cost and in lesser time. According to estimates, the global market for biologics is over USD 180 billion and represents a share of 15%-20% of the overall pharmaceuticals market. The technological advances in single-use process and facilities will aid in the reduction of drug substance manufacturing costs. Downstream processing improvements and chromatography resins make up a large portion of the costs. Therefore, changing a polishing step from resin chromatography to an SU membrane column can significantly reduce expenses. Several research studies have indicated that after using SUTs, unit operation cost is reduced by 20%-30% compared with traditional manufacturing practices.

The research study covers the present scenario and growth prospects of the global single-use bioprocessing systems market for 2017-2021. The market is segmented based on application (mAB production, vaccine production, plant cell cultivation, PSCTs, others), product type (bags and mixers, bioreactors and fermenters, filtration devices and sampling systems, bioprocess containers, and tubing), and end-user (pharmaceutical companies, CROs and CMOs, biotechnology companies, academic and research institutions). The market is further segmented based on geography (Americas, EMEA, and APAC). The global market for single-use bioprocessing systems was estimated at USD 3.67 billion in 2016 and is expected to grow moderately during the forecast period. The competition in the market is very high as the five key vendors, namely Sartorius, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Merck, Danaher, and GE Healthcare, occupy the major share of the market. Some of the reasons for the high adoption rates of single-use systems in biopharma manufacturing are reduced cost (manufacturing and set-up), increased flexibility (multiple productions), and quicker time to market. The emergence of disposable products such as the tangential flow filtration (TFF) devices in downstream applications and the importance of single-use technology in aiding continuous bioprocessing will boost the market demand for the global single-use bioprocessing system.

Technavio analysts highlight the following three factors that are contributing to the growth of the global single-use bioprocessing systems market: SUT combats global drug shortage problem Increasing M&As Rise in production of affordable biologics SUT combats global drug shortage problem The biopharmaceutical industry is shifting toward single-use technology (SUTs) to combat the global drug shortage. The increasing evidence of sterility, along with regulatory organizations encouraging pharma companies to switch to single-use technologies, hints toward a transition. Companies that have integrated and shifted toward a single-use system have expressed their satisfaction regarding lower costs, reduced overall contamination rates, and enhanced production throughput efficiency. Companies spend lesser time with disassembly and clean-up of the system while using SUTs, which results in quicker turnaround time for new batches of medications. Amber Chourasia, a lead lab equipment research analyst at Technavio, says, “Single-use technology is gaining popularity as it is the most cost-efficient solution to increase rapidity in drug development, support larger batches of production, and achieve a quicker time to market the solutions.” Increasing M&As The market has witnessed intense activities in the single-use bioprocessing systems in terms of M&As.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 16 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Antihypertensive Drugs Market Research Report: Key Trends and Forecast Research Report 2023 Human health is being affected by various factors which include rapid urbanization, demographic ageing and the globalization of unhealthy lifestyles. Hypertension is one of the keyhealth issuesthat are observed in both developed as well as developing countries. It is a silent, invisible killer that rarely causes symptoms and is one of the key risk factors forcoronary heart disease and ischemic as well as hemorrhagic stroke. Hypertension can also lead to various other problemssuch as renal impairment, visual impairment, heart failure and retinal hemorrhage. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 7.5 million deaths globally are caused due to hypertension, and it accounts to 12.8% of the total deaths. Globally,in 2008 prevalence of hypertension was observed to be around 40% in adults aged 25. According to the National Health and Nutrition Evaluation Survey, ithas been noted that in United States from 2007 to 2010,81.5% of the population is aware of their hypertension condition, out of which 74% are being treated and only 52.5% are under control. Theantihypertensive drugs market based on the therapy area is classified into diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide and indapamide), calcium channel blockers (nifedipine, felodipine and diltiazem), angiotensin receptor blockers or ARBs (losartan), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)inhibitors (captopril, lisinopril and perindopril), beta blockers vasodilators (atenolol and propranolol), alpha blockers (clonidine, guanabenz), and renin inhibitors.Diuretics being the first line of treatment for hypertension holds the major share of the market. All these drug classes (drugs) have shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The drugs are administered either as a single or combined dose depending upon the stage of hypertension, whilethe choice of drugs depends upon the patients’ medical history and current conditions. View Report- www.transparencymarketresearch.com/antihypertensive-drugs… On the basis of the geography, the antihypertensive market can be segmented into North America, Europe, AsiaPacific, Latin America, and Middle East and Africa.The global antihypertensive market is dominated mainly by North America and Europe. According to the WHO, the prevalence of hypertension is highest in Africa and lowest in Americas. In Africa more than 40% of the adults suffer from hypertension and many of them remain undiagnosed due to the high cost of medications.The increased genericization by the local companies can be a challenge for the market. Similarly, in recent years, there has beena significant improvement in the management of hypertension contributing to a strong decline in the death rates in North America and Western Europe The change in lifestyle, elevated stress level, and rise in prevalent population, early detection and penetration of combined dose would be the main factors to drive the growth of antihypertensive market. The patent expiry for major drugs such as Diovan (Novartis), Cozaar (Merck),Revatio (Pfizer), Exforge (Novartis), Atacand (AstraZeneca), Avapro (Sanofi Aventis), BIopress(Takeda) and Benicar (Daiichi Sankyo), along with low diagnostics rate and increased generic penetration would result in the antihypertensive market slowdown, but the novel antihypertensive drugs in the pipeline can recover the losses of patent expiration. Some of the major key players in the global antihypertensive market includes Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., Sanofi S.A, Johnson & Johnson Ltd., Daiichi – Sankyo, Merck & Co., AstraZeneca Plc.,Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited and Lupin Limited.

The pharmaceutical market is fluid and at times can defy predictions of observers of today’s pipelines. In recent years, several ‚disruptors’ have hit the market and pushed aside the current standard treatment protocols. Consider these Two Cases: Gilead Sciences has turned the Hepatitis C (HCV) treatment market upside down, for its competitors at least. In 2013, Gilead began to rollout its new therapies for HCV, of which the company claimed were superior products to the established market. A bold claim considering it was going up against some of the biggest names in biopharmaceutical participation – mainly Merck and Roche. The market showed favor for Gilead’s products, which began to erode sales for Merck and Roche’s HCV products. By 2015, Gilead had a solid hold on the market with about 80% market share. In December 2014, Bristol-Myers Squibb was granted approval for its PD-1 monoclonal antibody Opdivo (nivolumab). Opdivo was originally granted approval for advanced melanoma; by the end of 2016, lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, lymphoma, and head & neck cancer were also approved. Approvals continue to be pursued and granted for 2017. What will be the next source of disruption in the market?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 16 May 2017 by Rahul Jadhav Global Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Drugs Market to grow at a Phenomenal CAGR of 7.07% during the period 2017-2021 Summary Orbis Research delivers key insights on the Global Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) Drugs Market 2017-2021 This New Report contains a comprehensive market and vendor landscape in addition to a SWOT analysis of the key vendors. Description Market Research Report – Global Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Drugs Market 2017-2021 The Following Companies As The Key Players In The Global Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Drugs Market: Astellas Pharma, Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline, and Sanofi. Other Prominent Vendors in the market are: ADC Therapeutics, Advaxis, Agennix, ANI Pharmaceuticals, Bayer HealthCare, BHR Pharma, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Boehringer Ingelheim, Dendreo (Valeant Pharmaceuticals), Eisai, Endo Pharmaceuticals, Ferring, Foresee Pharmaceuticals, Io Therapeutics, LIDDS, Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Merck, Novartis, Nymox Pharmaceutical, Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, and Urologix. Commenting on the report: “One trend in market is advancements in early-stage diagnosis through new diagnostic methods. New diagnostic methods for BPH are likely to boost the diagnosed patient pool, thereby fueling the market growth. The market has seen the emergence of novel diagnostic tests, which are expected to be more accurate than the conventional PSA blood test. Considering the failure of PSA test to detect early-stage BPH, researchers have been working on new diagnostic methods to improve diagnosis.” According to the report, one driver in market is growing geriatric male population. The presence of a large population with BPH symptoms is expected to drive the market growth. The risk of BPH increases exponentially with the rise in the age of an individual. Approximately, 80% of men who reach 60 years and above have mild to strong symptoms of BPH. This disorder affects one in 38 individuals in the age group of 40-59 years; however, in the age group of 60-69 years, it affects one in 14 individuals. However, the chances of developing this disorder among the population of under 40 years are rare. This indicates that rising aging male population is directly proportional to the risk of BPH. Currently, out of the total older population in the world, those aged above 65 years are the fastest-growing population group, accounting for 8.1% of the total population in 2014. This group is expected to reach 16% by 2050. This scenario is expected to drive the market growth. Get a PDF Sample of Global Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) Drugs Market Report at: http://www.orbisresearch.com/contacts/request-sample/283587   Further, the report states that one challenges in market is availability of minimally invasive surgery as a drug replacement. The growing popularity of minimally invasive surgeries as an alternative to the drug to cure BPH could hinder the market growth. The minimally invasive alternatives such as laser surgeries, transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT), transurethral needle ablation (TUNA), and open or laparoscopic subtotal prostatectomy require less recovery time with a minimum hospital stay. Since the maximum number of individuals are diagnosed at the chronic stages, the physicians prefer surgeries, which helps treat the indication effectively. Further, laparoscopic surgeries and robotic surgeries are gaining traction in the market, as they offer individuals a quicker and comfortable recovery option. In addition, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is one of the most common treatment approaches for enlarged prostate in which resectoscope equipped with small cutting tools is inserted into the urethra to remove blocking cells, thereby relieving the individual from BPH symptoms. The study was conducted using an objective combination of primary and secondary information including inputs from key participants in the industry. The report contains a comprehensive market and vendor landscape in addition to a SWOT analysis of the key vendors.

WHO said it was sending the team to the remote area in the north of the country near the border with Central African Republic. And a large vaccine nonprofit said it was ready to bring in Ebola vaccines if needed. Map showing the location of the Democratic Republic of Congo Google Maps "As of today, 11 suspected cases including three deaths have been reported," WHO said Saturday The #Ebola case in the Democratic Republic of Congo was confirmed by a national reference laboratory in Kinshasa #DRC— WHO (@WHO) May 12, 2017 "The health zone is situated in the remote, isolated and hard-to-reach northern part of the country, with limited transport and communication networks - factors that all impeded transmission of information about the suspected outbreak. Currently it takes about two to three days to reach the epicenter from Kinshasa," WHO said. "The full extent of the 2017 outbreak is still not yet clear." Related: Ebola Vaccine Works, Study Shows An Ebola epidemic in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia in 2013-2016 infected 28,000 people and killed more than 11,000 of them. It was the only epidemic of Ebola — usually, outbreaks are smaller and affect at the most a few hundred people. Vaccine developers rushed research on Ebola vaccines and there is an experimental vaccine that's been shown to be effective. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, has an agreement with vaccine maker Merck to have it ready. "Gavi's work with Merck means there are 300,000 doses of Ebola vaccine available if needed to stop this outbreak becoming a pandemic," Gavi CEO Dr. Seth Berkley said. "The vaccine has shown high efficacy in clinical trials and could play a vital role in protecting the most vulnerable." Related: Antibody Treatment Works Against Ebola Virus Cousin The Democratic Republic of Congo has had eight outbreaks but none in areas similar to the West Africa epidemic, which spread widely in part because of intense cross-border travel and trade in densely populated areas. The last one was in 2014, and killed 49 people. "It is a sad fact that the people of the DRC are all too familiar with this horrific disease," Berkley added in a statement. "The fact that this is a country that has experience dealing with Ebola should give us hope that we won't see a pandemic on the scale of the 2014 outbreak that hit West Africa. We stand ready to support the DRC Government in its fight against Ebola."

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Antidepressants Market: New Tech Developments and Advancements to Watch Out for 2024 Antidepressants are drugs used for the treatment of depressive disorders including dysthymia, obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety, chronic pain, eating disorders, and neuropathic pain. Depression is a medical disorder which is related to the brain. Symptoms of depression include feeling sad and tired, lacking energy, and having difficulty enjoying routine daily activities. According to CDC, depression affects about 1 in every 5 individuals in the U.S. According to WHO (World Health Organization), at present an estimated 350 million people worldwide are affected by depression. Depression affects 10% to 15% men and about 10% to 25% of women. Browse Market Research Report @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/antidepressants-market… The antidepressants market has been segmented based on the drug classes commonly used for the treatment of various types of depressive disorders. There are different types of antidepressant drugs available in the market such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (RIMA), tetracyclic antidepressants, etc. The different types of antidepressants are used in the treatment of depressive disorders. The different classes of antidepressants are as effective as each other, but some patients respond better to one antidepressant compared to another antidepressant. Side effects can also be different between these groups of antidepressants. Different types of depression disorders include dysthymic disorder, postpartum depression, psychotic depression, major or clinical depressive disorder, and seasonal affective disorder. Factors driving the antidepressants market are declining side effects and rising efficacy of drugs in various classes as well as growing geriatric population where rate of mental illness is higher. However, the overall antidepressants market growth would decrease due to patent expiry of key antidepressants, fragile pipeline of new drugs, increasing number of generic drug alternatives, and growing prevalence of treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders. Region wise, the global fermented ingredients market is segmented into five regions; North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East & Africa. North America is the most dominant market for antidepressants due to the presence of a large patient population suffering from various types of anxiety disorders and depression. However, the antidepressants market in the U.S. is currently saturated, as several antidepressant drugs are available on prescription for the same indication. Hence, the future growth of the market would depend on introduction of efficacious drugs for new indications. Moreover, loss of patent exclusivity, market maturity, generic infiltration, and shortened drug lifecycles are the additional factors that contribute to the decline in market growth in the region. Asia Pacific is expected to witness appreciable growth due to multiple factors such as high prevalence of psychiatric disorders and rapid economic growth in countries such as China, Japan, and Australia. Additionally, positive marketing approval for innovative medicines is likely to drive the market in the near future. For more information on this report, fill the form @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Currently, the market is highly fragmented and competitive in nature due to the involvement of both large and small pharmaceutical companies. AstraZeneca plc, Eli Lilly and Company, Forest Laboratories, GlaxoSmithKline plc, H. Lundbeck A/S, Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Co., Inc., Pfizer, Inc. and Sanofi S.A. are major companies operating in the antidepressants market. Majority of the market players are focusing on expanding distribution network as well as expanding geographical presence, as Asia Pacific, the Middle East& Africa, and Latin America are developing regions with an increasing prevalence of various types of depressive disorders and improving economic conditions. Differences in clinical efficacy between drugs are generally small because most modern antidepressants work through a common biological mechanism. As a result, drug makers use direct-to-consumer advertising and tweak side effect profiles in order to differentiate their products.

By Noel K. GallagherStaff Writer Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Email Writer 207-791-6387 Share Comment Read Article A Maine family with fourth-generation ties to Bates College has donated $50 million to the Lewiston school, the largest single gift in its history and probably the largest cash gift to a college in Maine, campus officials said. The donation came from Alison Grott Bonney and Michael Bonney, who both graduated from Bates in 1980. Alison Grott Bonney and Michael Bonney, 1980 Bates College graduates, gave the college $10 million last year, and now have donated a record $50 million. Related Headlines Bates College announces largest-ever single gift – $19 million Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → “I believe that never in the history of the liberal arts tradition has a liberal arts education been more critical, when one thinks about the future of our society, than today,” Michael Bonney said. The gift was announced as part of a five-year, $300 million capital campaign, the largest capital campaign in the school’s history. “This campaign will be transformational for Bates,” President Clayton Spencer said Tuesday night at a campaign kickoff event held at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. “The Bates Campaign provides us with the opportunity to secure the programs and values that have defined Bates for a century and a half and to shape new strategies for a new age,” she said. Last year the Bonneys gave a $10 million gift, which was the largest single gift in the history of Bates at the time. Other Maine colleges have received large donations, sometimes in objects, not cash. In February, the Colby College Museum of Art received its second gift of art valued at more than $100 million from longtime supporters Peter and Paula Lunder, which will launch the Lunder Institute for American Art. Also this year, Colby received $25 million from the Davis Family Foundation to fund study abroad opportunities, and $10 million from Portland developer Joseph Boulos toward a new athletic complex. Last year, Bowdoin College in Brunswick received a $10 million gift from college trustee David Roux and his wife, Barbara, to build a new center for studying the environment. The University of Maine and University of Southern Maine are both launching major capital campaigns this spring. Colby is also in fundraising mode this year, having recently announced it already had raised $100 million toward a $200 million state-of-the-art athletic center on campus that will include the state’s first Olympic-size swimming pool. Michael Bonney has served as a Bates trustee since 2002 and as board chairman since 2010. The Bonney family has ties to Bates going back to the 1920s, when Michael Bonney’s maternal grandfather graduated in 1927. Michael and Alison’s three children all graduated from Bates. Their $50 million gift, from the Bonneys’ family foundation, will help build new facilities and renovate existing science, technology, engineering and math facilities. After graduating from Bates with a degree in economics, Michael Bonney began his career with Maine-based Hannaford Brothers, working in the supermarket chain’s pharmacy operation. He worked at several pharmaceutical companies before retiring in 2014 as CEO and director of Cubist Pharmaceuticals, which was acquired by Merck for $9.5 billion. Bates spokeswoman Marjorie Hall said the college already has raised $168 million toward the capital campaign. Of the $300 million goal, $75 million is earmarked for financial aid; $100 million for academic programs, including $24 million for eight endowed professorships; $65 million for student programs, including $25 million for athletics and $24 million for internship and work-related programs; and $60 million for the endowment and annual fund. Bates’ endowment, as of last June, was $251 million, Hall said. Bates College has about 1,800 students, and tuition, fees, room and board are $66,720 a year. In the incoming class this year, 42 percent received need-based financial aid. Bates has been open to men and women from all racial, ethnic and religious backgrounds since its founding by Maine abolitionists in 1855. Noel K.

in 2015 to USD12.4 Billion in 2022 - Research and Markets News provided by Research and Markets 16 May, 2017, 08:30 ET Share this article DUBLIN, May 16, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Global Cancer Supportive Care Therapeutics Market to 2022 - Patent Expirations Create Opportunities for Biosimilars in the Chemotherapy Induced Anemia and Neutropenia Markets" report to their offering. The global cancer supportive care market is forecast to experience a low level of growth, with revenue increasing from USD11.7 Billion in 2015 to USD12.4 Billion in 2022 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 1.08%. Cancer is a disease characterized by abnormal cell growth and uncontrolled proliferation caused by a series of mutations that result in the formation of tumor, which can migrate around the body, in a process known as metastasis. There are more than 200 different types of cancers, which can have a range of different effects on the human body. However, most patients who die from cancer do so when their primary cancer metastasizes to another part of the body (NHS, 2016). The cancer supportive care therapy area comprises indications that are either a symptom of the patient's cancer, or a side effect of the treatment a patient receives to treat their cancer - primarily chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The six key indications analyzed in this report are chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (CIN), chemotherapy-induced anemia (CIA), chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), cancer pain, bone metastasis and oral mucositis.

The company's enterprise resource planning system will be divided into three bespoke versions for each division, the company said on Tuesday, adding that a split into separate legal entities could be the next step in 2018. Such moves are often seen as a prelude to possible changes in ownership, including separate stock market listings, but a company spokesman denied this is the intention. "The rationale is a different one," he said. "It's primarily about better taking into account the specific needs of the businesses and how they are being run. "Our portfolio has changed massively over the years, due to innovation and organic growth, but also via takeovers." The group, which traces its roots to a 17th-century pharmacy and is 70 percent owned by the holding company of its founder's descendants, has pursued a diversified business model to reduce the risk of the family being heavily invested in one area. It has built a global biotech laboratory supplies business with takeovers of Millipore and Sigma-Aldrich in 2010 and 2016, respectively. Merck's healthcare business includes cancer drugs, where it collaborates with Pfizer, fertility treatments, allergy drugs and consumer care products, while its chemicals division makes liquid crystals for TV screens, high-tech chemicals for electronics and pearlescent pigments.

GET SAMPLE REPORT @ https://www.wiseguyreports.com/sample-request/33800-countryfocus-healthcare-regulatory-and-reimbursement-landscape-spain The pharmaceutical market was worth approximately $25.1 billion in 2008, and declined to approximately $23.7 billion in 2016 and is expected to reach $25.1 billion in 2021, registering a CAGR of 0.9% between 2017 and 2021.

(Paris:ALNOX) (Alternext Paris: ALNOX), a biotechnology company whose core focus is on improving cancer treatment by targeting the tumor microenvironment, today announced the signing of an agreement with the National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) in Heidelberg under which the NCT will conduct a trial evaluating NOXXONs lead product candidate NOX-A12 in combination with Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) in metastatic pancreatic and colorectal cancer. In some preclinical studies, NOX-A12 has shown an ability to make the immediate area surrounding a model tumor, the so-called tumor microenvironment, more accessible to the immune system. The ability of many tumors to use the tumor microenvironment to hide from the immune system is believed to contribute to the insensitivity of some tumors towards checkpoint inhibitors, such as Keytruda®. The NCT is a leading center for cancer research and treatment, located in Heidelberg, Germany. It was jointly founded by the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg University Hospital, Medical Faculty Heidelberg and German Cancer Aid (Deutsche Krebshilfe) in 2004 to conduct interdisciplinary research for preventing and treating cancer to ultimately benefit patients. The NCT investigators leading the clinical trial include Prof. Dr. Dirk Jäger, Managing Director, head of the clinical and tumor immunology research groups, and Dr. Niels Halama, Group Leader, both recognized leaders in clinical cancer research with significant experience in studying the tumor microenvironment in a clinical setting. Throughout his career, Prof. Dr. Jäger has focused on tumor and immunology as well as the interdisciplinary connections between both fields, both scientifically and clinically. NOXXONs Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Jarl Ulf Jungnelius, commented: "Dr. Jäger and Dr. Halama are experts in the treatment of metastatic cancer patients as well as the tumor microenvironment. We are extremely pleased that they will be collaborating with NOXXON on this groundbreaking study. Prof. Dr. Jäger, Managing Director of the NCT Heidelberg, commented: "This trial will enable us to explore the potential of NOX-A12 in combination with Keytruda® to benefit patients with few viable treatment options. Importantly, the trial will help us to better understand the ability of NOX-A12 to modify the tumor microenvironment and make it more accessible to the immune system to facilitate tumor destruction. About NOXXON NOXXON Pharma N.V. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on cancer treatment. NOXXONs goal is to significantly enhance the effectiveness of cancer treatments including immuno-oncology approaches (such as immune checkpoint inhibitors) and current standards of care (such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy). NOXXONs Spiegelmer® platform has generated a proprietary pipeline of clinical-stage product candidates including its lead cancer drug candidate NOX-A12, which is the subject of a clinical immuno-oncology collaboration agreement with Merck & Co. / MSD (NYSE: MRK) to study NOX-A12 combined with Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) in pancreatic and colorectal cancer. NOXXON is supported by a strong group of leading international investors, including TVM Capital, Sofinnova Partners, Edmond de Rothschild Investment Partners, DEWB, NGN and Seventure. NOXXON has its statutory seat in Amsterdam, The Netherlands and its office in Berlin, Germany. Further information can be found at: www.noxxon.com About the National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) Heidelberg The NCT Heidelberg is a joint institution of the German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg University Hospital and German Cancer Aid. The NCT's goal is to link promising approaches from cancer research with patient care from diagnosis to treatment, aftercare and prevention. The interdisciplinary tumor outpatient clinic is the central element of the NCT. Here the patients benefit from an individual treatment plan prepared in a timely manner in interdisciplinary expert rounds, the so-called tumor boards. Participation in clinical studies provides access to innovative therapies. The NCT thereby acts as a pioneering platform that translates novel research results from the laboratory into clinical practice. The NCT cooperates with self-help groups and supports them in their work. Since 2015, a second site for the NCT beside Heidelberg has been under development in Dresden.

(Paris:ALNOX) (Alternext Paris: ALNOX), a biotechnology company whose core focus is on improving cancer treatment by targeting the tumor microenvironment, today announced the signing of an agreement with the National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) in Heidelberg under which the NCT will conduct a trial evaluating NOXXON’s lead product candidate NOX-A12 in combination with Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) in metastatic pancreatic and colorectal cancer. In some preclinical studies, NOX-A12 has shown an ability to make the immediate area surrounding a model tumor, the so-called tumor microenvironment, more accessible to the immune system. The ability of many tumors to use the tumor microenvironment to hide from the immune system is believed to contribute to the insensitivity of some tumors towards checkpoint inhibitors, such as Keytruda®. The NCT is a leading center for cancer research and treatment, located in Heidelberg, Germany. It was jointly founded by the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg University Hospital, Medical Faculty Heidelberg and German Cancer Aid (Deutsche Krebshilfe) in 2004 to conduct interdisciplinary research for preventing and treating cancer to ultimately benefit patients. The NCT investigators leading the clinical trial include Prof. Dr. Dirk Jäger, Managing Director, head of the clinical and tumor immunology research groups, and Dr. Niels Halama, Group Leader, both recognized leaders in clinical cancer research with significant experience in studying the tumor microenvironment in a clinical setting. Throughout his career, Prof. Dr. Jäger has focused on tumor and immunology as well as the interdisciplinary connections between both fields, both scientifically and clinically. NOXXON’s Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Jarl Ulf Jungnelius, commented: “Dr. Jäger and Dr. Halama are experts in the treatment of metastatic cancer patients as well as the tumor microenvironment. We are extremely pleased that they will be collaborating with NOXXON on this groundbreaking study.” Prof. Dr. Jäger, Managing Director of the NCT Heidelberg, commented: “This trial will enable us to explore the potential of NOX-A12 in combination with Keytruda® to benefit patients with few viable treatment options. Importantly, the trial will help us to better understand the ability of NOX-A12 to modify the tumor microenvironment and make it more accessible to the immune system to facilitate tumor destruction.” About NOXXON NOXXON Pharma N.V. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on cancer treatment. NOXXON’s goal is to significantly enhance the effectiveness of cancer treatments including immuno-oncology approaches (such as immune checkpoint inhibitors) and current standards of care (such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy). NOXXON’s Spiegelmer® platform has generated a proprietary pipeline of clinical-stage product candidates including its lead cancer drug candidate NOX-A12, which is the subject of a clinical immuno-oncology collaboration agreement with Merck & Co. / MSD (NYSE: MRK) to study NOX-A12 combined with Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) in pancreatic and colorectal cancer. NOXXON is supported by a strong group of leading international investors, including TVM Capital, Sofinnova Partners, Edmond de Rothschild Investment Partners, DEWB, NGN and Seventure. NOXXON has its statutory seat in Amsterdam, The Netherlands and its office in Berlin, Germany. Further information can be found at: www.noxxon.com About the National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) Heidelberg The NCT Heidelberg is a joint institution of the German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg University Hospital and German Cancer Aid. The NCT’s goal is to link promising approaches from cancer research with patient care from diagnosis to treatment, aftercare and prevention. The interdisciplinary tumor outpatient clinic is the central element of the NCT. Here the patients benefit from an individual treatment plan prepared in a timely manner in interdisciplinary expert rounds, the so-called tumor boards. Participation in clinical studies provides access to innovative therapies. The NCT thereby acts as a pioneering platform that translates novel research results from the laboratory into clinical practice. The NCT cooperates with self-help groups and supports them in their work. Since 2015, a second site for the NCT beside Heidelberg has been under development in Dresden.

Oncology investing can certainly be intimidating. Here, the Investing News Network looks at companies in the space and other ways to invest. « 5 Top NASDAQ Biotech Stoc… Why Consider Investing in… » Bryan Mc Govern • May 15, 2017 Add Comment Oncology relates to cancer as a way to study prevention methods, proper diagnosis, and effective treatment. Investing in this sector can push a company towards achieving significant developments in the fight against cancer. Cancer treatment is a complicated matter for companies due to the varying types of the disease. When a life science company conducts research or seeks to develop a product for this market, it is more likely than not that they set on a very specific type of cancer to fight. As with any life science company, investors need to remember the risks are always going to be high, and with serious treatments and novel therapies, patience is one of the key allies for investors. In that regard, here the Investing News Network looks at some oncology companies active in the space, oncology approvals from the FDA, and stem cell research against cancer. Through this, the answer to “what is oncology investing?” can be better understood. “Trump’s victory could mean the end of Obamacare. Is right now a good time to invest in pharmaceutical stocks?” Learn everything an investor needs to know about investing in pharmaceuticals. Get My Free Report Click here to download for free What is oncology investing? An overview As mentioned above, cancer treatments are complicated in that not only is there a large number of cancer types, there’s varying treatments for the same disease. In that regard, there is no single cure for cancer, and the number of new cancer cases is expected to reach 25 million by 2030, according to the latest World Cancer Report published in 2014. Still, discoveries and advancements towards finding cures are being made all the time. In early 2017, the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) released a forecast for cancer research and treatment advances and touched base on immunotherapy. In the report, Elizabeth  Jaffee, a former board member of the AACR, said that in the area of immunotherapy, more is being learned about the signals tumors send “to inhibit an effective immune response against them.” “We have already turned this knowledge into therapeutics that inhibit some of these signals (checkpoint inhibitors) so the T cells can be effective in attacking the cancer cells, and developing therapeutics that can activate certain other cells within the tumor microenvironment (checkpoint agonists) to help further activate the T cells,” she said in the report. In short, Jaffee said that with those methods, they have been able to give patients with weeks to live a better quality of life. When it comes to investing in oncology, it can certainly be intimidating due to the large volume of technologies, medicine and research being done. In short, knowledge is key when it comes to choosing how and where to invest. “Trump’s victory could mean the end of Obamacare.

Get My Free Report Click here to download for free Oncology companies When it comes to investing in oncology companies, there is certainly no shortage of them conducting research and working to fight against cancer. Here INN takes a glance at a select few with market caps of less than $500 million. Champions Oncology (NASDAQ:CSBR) Market cap: $27.45 million Champions Oncology focused on developing and selling technology solutions and products to personalize the development and use of oncology drugs, particularly in the biotech and pharmaceuticals sector. In particular, the company’s two segments include Personalized Oncology Solutions (POS) and Translational Oncology Solutions (TOS). The former gives doctors and patients information to help with the decision of treatment plans, while the latter provides services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies looking for personalized approaches to drug development. Oncolytics Biotech (TSX:ONC, OTCQX:ONCYF) Market cap: $106 million Oncolytics Biotech is an interesting prospect in this area that thanks to some recent funding this year seems poised to elevate the cancer therapeutic market. The company is developing their cancer therapeutic Reolysin, which has undergone a variety of clinical trials in various stages completed by itself or in combination with biologics, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. OncoCyte (NYSE:OCX) Market cap: $179.41 million This company is working on prevention rather than treatment. Instead of the potentially long term play of care, OncoCyte focuses on their liquid biopsies with blood and urine samples to find better results and improve the life expectancy of patients. Q BioMed (OTCQB:QBIO) Market cap: $42 million Q BioMed is a biomedical acceleration and development company, meaning they seek to acquire other companies with interesting technology or products. In 2017, the company has shared new developments from their cancer division. To start with, in February Q BioMed secured a partnership with the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation and the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology in order to develop a chemotherapeutics technology. “Our ultimate goal is to use it as an effective chemotherapeutic against liver cancer, which currently has very few therapeutic options,” Q BioMed CEO Denis Corin said in the release. This proposal comes from a study published last year in Scientific Reports on the use of uttroside B in the fight against liver cancer. By March, the company had collected a total of $2.5 million to date in funding, from its originally announced $4 million agreement with Yorkville Advisors Global. Thanks to this funding Q BioMed is moving forward with the production of their cancer pain palliation drug. Sierra Oncology (NASDAQ:SRRA) Market cap: $63.28 million Sierra Oncology is a clinical stage drug development company whose lead product is a small molecule inhibitor Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) which mediates the DNA Damage Response network. The company is in the middle of a trial for SRA737, for which they recently received approval to upgrade by adding prospectively selected patients dealing with tumors “identified to have genetic aberrations hypothesized to confer sensitivity to Chk1 inhibition.” Oncology approvals As such the US Food and Drug Administration has approved drugs that actively target many variations of cancer, which may spread to different parts of the body. This year has already seen a strong and consistent stream of advances and approvals from the FDA. EMD Serono, a biopharmaceutical in partnership with Merck (NYSE:MRK) and Pfzer (NYSE:PFE), received an accelerated approval for BAVENCIO. This is used to treat patients with advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma with disease progression even with chemotherapy. Similarly, Novartis Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:NVS) received approval for Kisqali as a result of  an international clinical trial with 668 patients. This treatment is set to target metastatic breast cancer. Thanks to Kisqali, 53 percent of women in this trial saw a 30 percent tumor burden reduction. Other ways to invest Like many other sectors, investors looking to get into the oncology sector can do so by way of an ETF. For many, ETFs are an attractive way to strengthen portfolios, especially to those who are interested in a specific market rather than individual companies. On that note, there is one cancer ETF for consideration:  the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF (NASDAQ:CNCR) tracks companies in the biotech space, particularly those that treat cancer by using drugs that don’t impact the body’s immune response. As of May 12, 2017, the Loncar ETF currently tracks 31 holdings, which can be found here. Did we miss a company that should be included? Let us know in the comments!

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Rising Competition from Generics Compel Players to Aim at Comprehensive Pharmaceutical Product Lifecycle Management (LCM) Strategies Albany, NY — (SBWIRE) — 05/16/2017 — MarketResearchReports.biz has announced the addition of a report, titled „Pharmaceutical Lifecycle Management Strategies in 2017”, to its large depository. It provides a detailed analysis of product lifecycle (LCM) management strategies that are being implemented and are expected to come into force later this year by pharmaceutical companies worldwide. In recent times, the global pharmaceutical industry has witnessed rapidly changing healthcare landscape, stiff competition from generic and biosimilar manufacturers, and declining research and development productivity. To grow and stay relevant in this fast-changing marketplace, participants are looking at holistic approaches to improve processes that can escalate innovative product development while cutting down operational costs. View Report @ http://www.marketresearchreports.biz/analysis/1065938 One such holistic approach is to resort to pharmaceutical product lifecycle management strategies (LCM), which manage pharmaceutical products and related information across the enterprise. However, with the prevailing landscape, these strategies can no longer focus solely on the period between launch and patent expiry. The influx of generics is making the conventional LCM approach insufficient today. Determining apt LCM strategies is, therefore, imperative for manufacturers. To appeal more diverse and global customer base, players are focusing towards stepping up their game in creating, packaging, and quickly delivering consumer products. They are adopting LCM strategies that encompass the whole lifecycle of a pharmaceutical product from discovery through development and commercialization and on into post-market exclusivity. Through these strategies, they are also including planning for competition from generic forms in the initial stages of the development phase, instead of focusing on this area after the product is launched. Get Sample Copy Of this Report @ http://www.marketresearchreports.biz/sample/sample/1065938 In the process of following more comprehensive life cycle management model, several pharmaceutical companies have discovered that inputs from different verticals within the business must be considered. A cross-functional LCM model includes representatives from marketing, regulatory, research and development, process engineering, manufacturing, and other verticals across all therapeutic areas. This type of team can help formulate an overall company-wide strategy as well as product-focused strategies. Branded drug manufacturers that aim at new approaches to LCM strategies often rely on contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) with experience in the designing and execution of LCM solutions. CDMOs not only help in boosting the efficiency of processes of production, they also help in reducing the risks pertaining to product development and commercialization. View Press Release @ http://www.marketresearchreports.biz/pressrelease/4411 The report also sheds light on different aspects of development strategies, including introduction and classification, indication expansion, reformulation, and next-generation products. It includes case studies of various pharmaceutical giants who have implemented LCM strategies, successfully and unsuccessfully. The list of successful implementers includes Pfizer, Teva, Roche & GSK, Cipla, AbbVie, and AstraZeneca. It also offers insights into LCM strategies for pipeline products by companies, including Johnson & Johnson, Merck &Co, Takeda, Eisai, and AbbVie.

Considerable progress in the animal health biotechnology took place recently when biotechnology applications were utilized in both detecting and treating various infectious and parasitic diseases of animals. This has led to the development of a range of applications and procedures, which will benefit both domestic and wild animals. This will also improve the health of various companion animals, help in improving sporting animals’ performance and the productivity of farm animals. However, the globalised trade in live animals, animal products, and their feeds is leading to a continuously increasing threat of infectious diseases worldwide. Thus, to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) emphasizes the importance of very rapid, accurate, highly specific and sensitive detection and identification of infectious agents; and prompt and effective control of those diseases. Obtain Report Details @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/animal-health-biotechn… Animal Health Biotechnology Market: Current Outlook Presently, various reagents and diagnostic techniques have been developed, which are more specific, sensitive, rapid, reproducible and robust that have been updated through recent discoveries in biochemistry, immunology and molecular biology (monoclonal antibodies, nucleic probes, DNA amplification and others). The development of new vaccines, such as subunit vaccines, synthetic vaccines, recombinant vaccines and anti-idiotype vaccines, which combine efficacy, innocuity, duration of protection, ease of use, stability and multivalence. The availability of new anti-parasitic and anti-infective agents and immunomodulatory therapeutic agents specifies that biotechnology is continuing to find new applications in the field of animal health. These new vaccines, diagnostic techniques, and therapeutic substances will add to the knowledge, which, in future, will extend to the development of transgenic animals with improved genetic potential and will be more disease resistant and more productive at the same time. Thus, the most important objective of animal health biotechnology is to serve human healthcare as well as its environment at the same time.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 16 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman North America Porcine Vaccine Market Analysis and Forecasts, 2016 – 2024 North America Porcine Vaccine Market: Snapshot For several decades, vaccination has remained one of the most important interventions for disease prevention among humans and animals. In veterinary medicine, vaccination has proven to be a boon for animal health. Diseases such as diarrhoea, swine influenza, porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSV), porcine circovirus associated disease (PCVAD), have been greatly reduced from spreading endemic in several cases. Some diseases such as foot and mouth disease and cholera high fever in swines have been significantly eliminated in North America with the help of vaccination. The market for porcine vaccine in the region is expected to exhibit healthy growth in the next few years as well. The rising demand for meat and gelatin and concerns regarding the rising pace of occurrence of zoonotic diseases will be the key factors driving the market in the near future. Transparency Market Research estimates that the North America porcine vaccine market will expand at a 5.3% CAGR from 2016 to 2024. As a result, the market, which valued at US$540.9 mn in 2015, will rise to US$926.2 mn by 2024. This 131 page report gives readers a comprehensive overview of the porcine vaccine market. Browse through 10 data tables and 43 figures to unlock the hidden opportunities in this market: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/north-america-porcine-… Inactivated Vaccines to Remain Most Preferred In terms of the technology used to develop vaccines, the North America porcine vaccines market has been segmented into inactivated vaccines, live attenuated vaccines, recombinant vaccines, toxoid vaccines, DNA vaccines, and conjugate vaccines. Of these, the segment of inactivated vaccines dominated the market in 2015 and is expected to account for a 53.3% of the North America veterinary vaccine market in 2016. The segment is also expected to exhibit the most promising growth in the near future, expanding at a 6.7% CAGR over the period between 2016 and 2024. The segment of live attenuated vaccines will exhibit a strong 5.9% CAGR over the said period. Rise in the number of swine farms, rising prevalence of zoonotic disease, and increase in investments by key players are likely to drive the live attenuated vaccine segment. The DNA vaccine segment is projected to emerge as a high-growth segment owing to rise in demand and increase in R&D investments. DNA vaccines have shown excellent results in granting strong immunity against homologous infections and have a good score in terms of approval from regulatory bodies in the region. As a result, the demand for these vaccines is expected to rise at a healthy pace in the region over the forecast period. Request a sample of this report to know what opportunities will emerge in the rapidly evolving porcine vaccine market during 2016 – 2024: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… U.S. Market to Continue to Account for Dominant Chunk in Sales The North America porcine vaccine market has been examined for two countries in the region: the U.S. and Canada. The U.S. market for porcine vaccines accounted for a larger 63% share in the North America market in 2015. The U.S. porcine vaccine market is expected to exhibit the most lucrative 6.6% CAGR over the period between 2016 and 2024.
