These top vendors, namely Zoetis, Inc., Merck & Co., Sanofi-Aventis, Boehringer Ingelheim, and Eli Lilly and Company hold commanding positions owing to their wide geographic presence and a strong financial backing allowing increased focus on research and development activities. Top companies in the market aim to strengthen their positions with strategies such as targeted in-licensing, acquisition, and innovative marketing. Use of the digital medium to reach out to an extended consumer base and serve the consumer more effectively has also started becoming a popular strategy. An instance is the recent update made to Bayer's BCS cowdition smartphone application in July 2016. The enhanced application is expected to help veterinarians to track the current and future hurdles regarding cattle health, which will help minimize the impact of metabolic diseases on dairy cows. Download PDF Brochure of Research Report - http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=16682 Transparency Market Research estimates that the global clostridium vaccines market will exhibit a healthy 4.9% CAGR over the period between 2016 and 2024. Rising at this rate, the market, which valued at US$418.0 mn in 2015, is expected to reach US$643.5 mn by 2024. In terms of animal species, the swine segment presently leads but is expected to be outpaced by the growth of the ovine segment. In terms of geography, the global market is dominated by North America, which accounted for over 37% of the global market in 2015. Rising Intervention by Government Bodies to Play Key Role in Market Development  Government initiatives play a key role the development of animal health care markets. For instance, the China market for veterinary healthcare is chiefly driven by compulsory immunization policy, several animal health awareness programs, the easy availability of affordable veterinary vaccines, and fund for research and development in the field. In several other developed as well as developing economies, funds invested by government bodies for the research and development of veterinary vaccines and medications play a key role in boosting the demand for clostridium vaccines. Along with this, the rising global demand for animal products such as cattle milk, meat, and eggs is also a key factor driving the global market for clostridium vaccines. Animal products such as milk, pork, beef, and chicken collectively account for nearly 40% of global agricultural GDP and generated revenues valuing nearly US$600 bn in 2015. The market for these products in developing countries is growing rapidly due to the rising population and increased disposable incomes. The resultant rise in awareness regarding the need for maintaining the excellent health of animals is expected to further drive the clostridium vaccines market in the near future. Get Discounts on Report Purchase: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=D&rep_id=16682     High Consumer Dependence on Government Distribution Channels to Hamper Growth  In emerging economies, especially, government bodies play the central role in the distribution of vaccines. The Government of India, for instance, buys clostridium vaccines in bulk from manufacturers and supply them in different regions of the country. Bulk purchase of clostridium vaccines results in reduced prices, resulting in the low profitability of the market thus hampering its overall rate of development. Moreover, the market's growth is also restrained to vast extent owing to the short exclusivity span of clostridium vaccines. Product exclusivity period in the animal health care industry is mostly only about three years to five years. Shorter exclusivity periods lead to a vast rise in competition from generics and over-the-counter (OTC) products. The increase in generic competition lowers product sales and significantly affects the profitability of the market. This review of the market is based on a recent market research report published by Transparency Market Research, titled "Clostridium Vaccine (Animal Health) Market - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast 2016 - 2024."

Dow Jones futures fell more than 4 percent after the real-estate mogul's victory was confirmed in the wee hours of Wednesday, yet the Dow Jones industrial average was up about 0.5 percent at 11:20 am. Pharmaceutical stocks were up sharply, with Pfizer up nearly 7 percent and Merck around 5.6 percent higher. Heavy equipment maker Caterpillar and financial services giant JPMorgan Chase also saw strong gains before midday, up 6.1 percent and 4 percent, respectively, while investment bank Goldman Sachs was up nearly 3 percent, consumer goods manufacturer Johnson & Johnson climbed 2.4 percent and financial services corporation American Express was 1.1 percent higher. By contrast, insurance company Travelers, down 1.63 percent; consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble, off 1.9 percent; and Coca-Cola, which had fallen 1.9 percent, were among a group of stocks that lost ground in morning trading. The S&P 500 was up around 0.3 percent, while the Nasdaq composite was up 0.15 percent.   Print   Email   Share   Comments Recommend Tweet Share This Article View Article Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Health-care shares and lenders surged as investors unwound bets that a win by Hillary Clinton would bring stronger regulatory scrutiny. The SPDR S&P Biotech exchange-traded fund rose the most since 2008, while Pfizer Inc. and Merck & Co. jumped at least 6 per cent. JPMorgan Chase & Co. rose 4.6 per cent to a record, and Goldman Sachs had its best one-day gain in 4 1/2 years. The S&P 500 rose 1.1 per cent to 2,163.11 at 4 p.m. in New York, extending its advance after rising above its average prices during the past 50 and 100 days. The Dow rallied 1.4 per cent, to a two-month high. “Our base case is we’re more likely to see a more moderate president than we saw as a candidate and the market’s agreeing with that,” said Lowell Yura, head of multi-asset solutions for BMO Global Asset Management in Chicago, which oversees US$238 billion. “We don’t see a huge impact to short-term earnings and short-term economic growth.” A knee-jerk selloff in global stocks and a rally in haven assets reversed on wagers that Trump would increase fiscal spending to spur economic growth, and as he struck a more conciliatory tone in his first speech as president-elect. A Trump victory had been portrayed by analysts as having the potential to unhinge markets banking on a continuation of policies that coincided with the second-longest bull market in S&P 500 history. While Republican control of both houses of Congress may enable the party to enact sweeping legislation that would be considered pro-business, concern persists over the impact from Trump’s pledges to clamp down on immigration to the US and renegotiate free-trade agreements with countries including Mexico. “People focus on the fact that his acceptance speech kind of changed the direction of the market,” said Krishna Memani, New York-based chief investment officer at Oppenheimer Funds Inc., which oversees $223 billion. “It was far more conciliatory and far more fiscal-focused than these acceptances typically are -- that made a world of difference.” Election over, Donald Trump must now change his tune A basket of stocks identified by Morgan Stanley that are most likely to benefit from a Trump win surged 6.4 per cent. The group includes 53 companies ranging from drugmaker Alexion Pharmaceuticals to construction-materials producer Martin Marietta Materials Inc. Among other shares boosted by the Republican’s win, prison operators soared on speculation the new administration will rescind a government contract phase-out. Corrections Corp. and Geo Group Inc. jumped more than 21 per cent. Companies gaining on Trump’s plans to boost infrastructure spending included equipment provider United Rentals Inc., capped its steepest advance in almost eight years, while Caterpillar Inc. added 7.7 per cent, the most since 2011. Vulcan Materials Co. climbed to an all-time high. Along with the potential for a lighter regulatory burden, banks were also boosted by soaring bond yields as investors’ inflation expectations climbed on speculation a Trump administration and Republican Congress will ramp up spending to lift growth. Wells Fargo & Co. and Bank of America Corp. gained more than 5 per cent, with Wells Fargo jumping the most since 2012. As the initial turbulence eased, odds for a Federal Reserve interest-rate hike in December climbed back to levels seen before Trump’s victory, after plunging below 50 per cent as the outcome unfolded. The market-implied chance of a move next month is 86 per cent, the same as the probability on Tuesday afternoon. “The US that Trump inherits is doing pretty well economically,” said Nandini Ramakrishnan, a strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management in London. “From an investment perspective, this is not something that we would say is entirely negative as the market may see just this morning. There may be potential opportunities with some of these selloffs.” In the 22 elections going back to 1928, the S&P 500 has fallen 15 times the day after polls close, for an average loss of 1.8 per cent. Stocks reversed course and moved higher over the next 12 months in nine of those instances, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.   Most Popular Viewed 1 Hillary Clinton is pretty much a slam dunk to become the next US President 2 Protectionist policies laid out by the Trump campaign point to hard times ahead for Hong Kong and China 3 President Trump: How did the polls get U.S. election so wrong? 4 Hillary Clinton: the world’s best investor or an out-and-out crook? 5 Brace for Singles’ Day as Chinese consumers click and swipe to shop Shared 1 Hillary Clinton is pretty much a slam dunk to become the next US President 2 Protectionist policies laid out by the Trump campaign point to hard times ahead for Hong Kong and China 3 President Trump: How did the polls get U.S. election so wrong? 4 Brace for Singles’ Day as Chinese consumers click and swipe to shop 5 This one predictable trend will emerge from Donald Trump’s shock election victory Commented 1 First two, now 15 Hong Kong lawmakers face prospect of being expelled from Legislative Council 2 Legco meeting suspended as Hong Kong lawmaker asks for debate on Beijing’s Basic Law ruling 3 Defying pundits and pollsters, Donald Trump is the next US president.

No pesky price regulation over drugs like EpiPen! No pesky safety regulation over blood thinning drugs like drug Xarelto, linked to 500 deaths. No speed bumps when Pfizer et al seeks to dodge U.S. taxes by incorporating overseas--the same taxes that fund their drugs in Medicare, TRICARE and other U.S. programs. Pharma is gleeful about a Trump presidency by Martha Rosenberg Of course, Pharma did not need a Trump presidency. Its profit party began in earnest with the nomination and confirmation earlier this year of Robert Califf as FDA Commissioner despite financial links to 23 Pharma companies including Johnson & Johnson, Lilly, Merck, Schering Plough and GSK according to a statement on the website of Duke Clinical Research Institute which he directed. In disclosure information for an article in Circulation, Califf also lists financial links to Gambro, Regeneron, Gilead, AstraZeneca, Roche and other companies and equity positions in four medical companies. Califf "served as a director, officer, partner, employee, advisor, consultant or trustee for Genentech," said the Medscape website. This is an FDA Commissioner? In the past, someone so heavily funded by industry would not be considered for a government position regulating that very industry. Yet on PBS, Califf saw no problem with doctors and researchers receiving Pharma money and actually thought it desirable. "Many of us consult with the pharmaceutical industry, which I think is a very good thing," he told host Susan Dentzer. Two government institutes are also happily feeding the Pharma beast. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), says the institute is looking to Pharma to find a "vaccine" for drug addiction. What? Shouldn't Volkow know, as head of the Institute, there is no "cure" or vaccine for addiction--that it is widely viewed as a physical, psychological and spiritual disease? Especially as opioid addiction-related deaths number in the thousands each year? Has she ever talked to Michael Botticelli, director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy who, as an addict himself, advocates non-drug, non-Pharma, peer treatment for addiction? And shouldn't NIDA replace the very dated term "drug abuse" with the non-judgmental term "addiction"?) Animal lovers will be appalled at what Volkow has done to primates in the lab only to conclude that maternal drug use affects offspring. No sh*t, Volkow. - Advertisement - Under the leadership of industry-friendly Thomas Insel, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has also been feeding the Pharma beast. Non-drug research is no longer even fundable, lamented a recent New York Times editorial. Insel, an early proponent of SSRI antidepressants which he said worked better and faster than non-drug psychotherapy, left government to work at a billion dollar, semi-secret private venture between Google and Pharma last year that few are even aware of. The CEO of the new Google life sciences venture is former Genentech chairman Art Levinson. Insel, while NIMH director, said that not enough toddlers were on stimulants for ADHD even as the nation was aghast at how many children are dosed. As Trump moves toward the Oval Office, many feel his election does not represent popular sentiment--the same disconnect seen with Pharma. Public anger at Pharma and its outrageous prices is at a peak but regulatory firewalls are evaporating and alarming conflicts of interest tolerated. In February a smirking Martin Shkreli, founder of Turing Pharmaceuticals, refused to explain or defend his price hike of the antiparasitic drug Daraprim from $13.50 to $750 on the Hill, a price hike that could put the life-saving drug out of reach for some. With clear derision for regulators and the public itself, he tweeted that lawmakers were "imbeciles" after he testified. Then Mylan jacked the price of its EpiPen, an emergency allergy treatment that saves lives, to $600 up from the $100 almost overnight this summer. After public uproar, Mylan offered EpiPen cost breaks to low-income people--a common Pharma ruse that simply shifts costs to others while letting Pharma keep its prices. Meanwhile hepatitis C drugs that cost $84,000 a course of treatment are looting our Medicaid tax dollars in strapped states. No, Pharma did not need a Trump presidency for a profit party--but the rejoicing will be merrier.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Clostridium Vaccine (Animal Health) Market is Expected to Reach US$643.5 Million by 2024 ALBANY, New York, November 9, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — The global Clostridium Vaccine (Animal Health) Market features a largely consolidated competitive landscape, with the top five companies collectively accounting for a share of over 63% of the overall market in 2015, observes a recent report by Transparency Market Research (TMR). These top vendors, namely Zoetis, Inc., Merck & Co., Sanofi-Aventis, Boehringer Ingelheim, and Eli Lilly and Company hold commanding positions owing to their wide geographic presence and a strong financial backing allowing increased focus on research and development activities. Top companies in the market aim to strengthen their positions with strategies such as targeted in-licensing, acquisition, and innovative marketing. Use of the digital medium to reach out to an extended consumer base and serve the consumer more effectively has also started becoming a popular strategy. An instance is the recent update made to Bayer’s BCS cowdition smartphone application in July 2016. The enhanced application is expected to help veterinarians to track the current and future hurdles regarding cattle health, which will help minimize the impact of metabolic diseases on dairy cows. Download PDF Brochure of Research Report – http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=16682 Transparency Market Research estimates that the global clostridium vaccines market will exhibit a healthy 4.9% CAGR over the period between 2016 and 2024. Rising at this rate, the market, which valued at US$418.0 mn in 2015, is expected to reach US$643.5 mn by 2024. In terms of animal species, the swine segment presently leads but is expected to be outpaced by the growth of the ovine segment. In terms of geography, the global market is dominated by North America, which accounted for over 37% of the global market in 2015. Rising Intervention by Government Bodies to Play Key Role in Market Development  Government initiatives play a key role the development of animal health care markets. For instance, the China market for veterinary healthcare is chiefly driven by compulsory immunization policy, several animal health awareness programs, the easy availability of affordable veterinary vaccines, and fund for research and development in the field. In several other developed as well as developing economies, funds invested by government bodies for the research and development of veterinary vaccines and medications play a key role in boosting the demand for clostridium vaccines. Along with this, the rising global demand for animal products such as cattle milk, meat, and eggs is also a key factor driving the global market for clostridium vaccines. Animal products such as milk, pork, beef, and chicken collectively account for nearly 40% of global agricultural GDP and generated revenues valuing nearly US$600 bn in 2015. The market for these products in developing countries is growing rapidly due to the rising population and increased disposable incomes. The resultant rise in awareness regarding the need for maintaining the excellent health of animals is expected to further drive the clostridium vaccines market in the near future. Get Discounts on Report Purchase: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=D&rep_id=16682     High Consumer Dependence on Government Distribution Channels to Hamper Growth  In emerging economies, especially, government bodies play the central role in the distribution of vaccines. The Government of India, for instance, buys clostridium vaccines in bulk from manufacturers and supply them in different regions of the country. Bulk purchase of clostridium vaccines results in reduced prices, resulting in the low profitability of the market thus hampering its overall rate of development. Moreover, the market’s growth is also restrained to vast extent owing to the short exclusivity span of clostridium vaccines. Product exclusivity period in the animal health care industry is mostly only about three years to five years. Shorter exclusivity periods lead to a vast rise in competition from generics and over-the-counter (OTC) products. The increase in generic competition lowers product sales and significantly affects the profitability of the market. This review of the market is based on a recent market research report published by Transparency Market Research, titled “Clostridium Vaccine (Animal Health) Market – Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast 2016 – 2024.” For the study, the market has been segmented as follows:  The global Clostridium Vaccine (Animal Health) market is segmented as follows:  Global Clostridium Vaccine (Animal Health) Market Revenue, by Animal Species  Bovine Ovine Caprine Swine Poultry Others Global Clostridium Vaccine (Animal Health) Market Revenue, by Distribution Channel  Veterinary Clinic Veterinary Hospital Veterinary Research institute Retail Pharmacy Global Clostridium Vaccine (Animal Health) Market Revenue, by Geography  North America US Canada Europe Germany France Italy Spain UK Rest of Europe Asia Pacific China India Australia New Zealand Rest of Asia Pacific Latin America Brazil Mexico Rest of Latin America Middle East and Africa Saudi Arabia South Africa Rest of Middle East & Africa Browse Related Research Report:  Veterinary Vaccines Market (Animal Type – Companion Animals (Equine, Canine, and Feline) and Livestock Animals (Bovine, Ovine, Porcine, and Poultry); Technology Type – Inactivated Vaccines, Live Attenuated Vaccines, Conjugate Vaccines, and Toxoid Vaccines) – Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecast 2016 – 2024 http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/veterinary-vaccines-market.html Human Vaccines Market (Vaccine Type – Conjugate, Recombinant, Inactivated, Combination, and Attenuated; Product – Pneumococcal, Influenza, Hepatitis, HPV, Meningococcal, Rotavirus, Measles, Typhoid, and Combination; Age Group – Pediatrics, Adolescents, Adults, and Geriatrics; Distribution Channel – Hospital Pharmacies and Drugstores) – Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecast 2016 – 2024 http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/human-vaccines-market.html U.S. Vaccine Market (Human Vaccines: Hepatitis, Influenza, Meningococcal, Pneumococcal, HPV, Combination Vaccines; Animal Vaccines: Canine, Feline, Porcine, Bovine, Ovine, Poultry and Equine) – Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast 2014 – 2020 http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/us-vaccine-market.html About Us:  Transparency Market Research (TMR) is a U.S. based provider of syndicated research, customized research, and consulting services.

Who We Are Healthcare Article Comments Your Email Recipient's Email Message (Optional) Send Cancel Patients Play Growing Role in Developing Treatments for Rare Diseases Lilo H. Stainton | November 9, 2016 Pharmaceutical companies say advocates and families are changing how they work State Trooper Wayne Blanchard (left), Assemblywoman Annette Quijano, Ciara, and her father, Trooper Brian Kerrigan. Hours had passed and the hearing room had nearly emptied by the time New Jersey State Trooper Brian Kerrigan finally got his chance to tell state lawmakers about the devastating impact Prader-Willi disease has on his daughter, Ciara, and their family. But Kerrigan patiently described the challenges of raising a child with a complex genetic disorder that impacts growth and development and calmly urged the panel to support a resolution designed to build awareness of the condition, which affects fewer than 15,000 people nationwide, including many children. “Without awareness, there is no funding; without funding, there is no research; without research, there is no cure; without a cure, there is no hope,” he testified. “We need to work together to make sure there is always hope.” While it may be a lonely journey, patients, family members, and other advocates are having a growing impact on the work of pharmaceutical companies, especially those pursuing treatments and cures for rare diseases. Collaborations between those who speak for the suffering and companies pursuing cures can help connect patients with greater options for care, while enabling drug companies to better target their resources, according to those involved. On Friday, BioNJ, an organization that represents more than 400 life-science companies in the Garden State, hosted its first patient advocacy conference at Celgene Corp. in Summit. The event featured representatives from a number of New Jersey’s pharma giants, including Merck and Pfizer; advocacy experts from the Hyacinth Foundation, which represents those with AIDS; patients working to raise awareness about their own conditions; and state lawmakers, including Assemblyman Herb Conaway, (D-Gloucester), who chairs the health committee. “It was a highly interactive day where industry and patient advocates of all types were able to network and discuss the need for patient input throughout the drug development process,” said Debbie Hart, the president and CEO of BioNJ. Jayne Gershkowitz, chief patient advocate for Amicus Therapeutics, who moderated the morning session, said the summit was the latest development in an ongoing movement to better involve patients in drug creation, testing, and marketing. In 2012, BioNJ launched a series of discussions on this topic, held a webinar, and drafted a white paper that outlined the growing role of patient advocacy. Some companies, like Amicus — whose CEO John Crowley’s quest to find a cure for his two children, who suffer from Pompe Disease, inspired the 2009 movie “Extraordinary Measures” — have long focused on patient needs, Gershkowitz said. The Cranbury-based company is working primarily on treatments for a trio of rare diseases: Fabry Disease, Pompe Disease, and Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB). “We place the patient and caregivers at the center of our model,” Gershkowitz said. Patient advocates — including sick individuals, their loved ones, and the organization they have come together to found in hopes of finding better treatment options — have for years played a critical role in finding solutions to rare or “orphan” diseases, Gershkowitz added. In the early 1980s, when HIV and AIDs were largely unknown outside the gay community, the passionate personal stories of those affected were critical to securing attention and funding for research, she said. “Patient advocacy has really come from the rare disease space,” she said. According to the National Organization for Rare Disorders, or NORD, a rare disease is one that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. With more than 7,000 conditions that fall into this category, one in 10 Americans, some 30 million, face a lifelong health challenge as a result. Patients are frequently undiagnosed or misdiagnosed and only 5 percent of these rare diseases have identified treatments, NORD reports. That dynamic is starting to change, in part due to patient advocacy. In recent years, one-third of all new drugs approved by the Federal Drug Administration have targeted rare conditions, according to NORD. Pharmaceutical companies pursuing treatments for more common maladies are also seeking greater patient participation, experts said. In its 2012 white paper, BioNJ noted that a survey of 75 of its members found more than three-fourths had established a patient advocacy program or were considering such an effort. But not all these pharma companies had followed through on this concept; fewer than one in five had dedicated staffing to the cause, and two in five spent less than $50,000 on the program. While patients gain access to new therapies and other resources, pharma companies also benefit from collaborating with patients on the development, trial, and launch of new products, experts noted. Patients can help companies identify unmet healthcare needs — especially when these relate to rare conditions focus their investment, define clinical trials, and encourage participation. And regardless of the disease, patients can inspire scientists with their personal stories, help the company manage patient expectations, and create a network for future feedback. As the life-science industry continues to advance the discovery and development of new therapies and cures, research-based companies are faced with tackling even more complex and difficult-to-treat diseases. As part of their efforts, companies are beginning to recognize the value of bringing together researchers, patients, caregivers, and advocacy groups in a unified and comprehensive way to meet a common goal,” wrote BioNJ president Hart and board chairman Dr. Francois Nader in the white paper’s introduction. “Developing these relationships among all these parties is vital for advancing drug discovery and development — because patients can’t wait.” There is no cure yet for Prader-Willi, and treatment largely involves behavior modification and constant supervision, Kerrigan told the Assembly health committee in September. The condition, which leaves patients feeling chronically hungry, can impact growth, metabolism, and cognitive function, and often leads to severe obesity. It is usually caused by a little-understood genetic error that occurs equally in both sexes and all races. But in New Jersey, support is building for a resolution to designate May as Prader-Willi Awareness Month. The Assembly panel passed the measure (AJR-111), sponsored by Assemblyman Jay Webber (R-Morris) and Annette Quijano (D-Union), with unanimous support; a Senate version was introduced by Sen. Joseph Vitale (D-Middlesex). “This disorder is often misdiagnosed because the medical community is unfamiliar with the syndrome,” Webber said after the vote. “That’s why this resolution is important. Delaying early diagnosis and treatment may increase the number of challenges children experience, so increasing the public’s awareness about PWS is critical.” Prader-Willi is not alone. NORD maintains a database of thousands of rare diseases, dozens of which have been recognized with their own month or day. And February 28 is Rare Disease Day, designed to raise awareness about the need for treatments for the tens of millions of patients and families impacted by these less well-known conditions.

As the global population grows and ages, the highest toll will be among women in poor and middle-income countries, it said, and much of it from cancers which are largely preventable. "Most of the deaths occur in young- and middle-aged adults,", placing a heavy burden on families and national economies, said Sally Cowal, senior vice president of global health at the American Cancer Society, which compiled the report with pharmaceutical company Merck. The review "highlights the large geographic inequality in availability of resources and preventive measures and treatment to combat the growing burden of cancer," she told AFP. Cancer is already killing one in seven women around the world, said the report -- the second highest cause of death after cardiovascular disease. All four of the deadliest cancers -- breast, colorectal, lung and cervical cancer -- are mostly preventable or can be detected early, when treatment is more successful. In poorer countries, a much smaller proportion of cancer cases are diagnosed and treated than in rich ones, while a much bigger group dies. The relative burden is growing for developing countries as people live longer due to better basic healthcare. Women in these countries are also increasingly exposed to known cancer risk factors "associated with rapid economic transition," said Cowal, "such as physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, obesity, and reproductive factors" such as postponing motherhood. "Due to these changes, cancers that were once common only in high-income countries are becoming more prevalent," said the report entitled "The Global Burden of Cancer in Women." It was presented Tuesday at the World Cancer Congress in Paris. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, there were 6.7 million new cancer cases and 3.5 million deaths among women worldwide in 2012. Of these, 56 percent of cases and 64 percent of deaths were in less developed countries. "These numbers are expected to increase to 9.9 million cases and 5.5 million deaths among females annually by 2030 as a result of the growth and ageing of the population," said the new report. Regional differences  The biggest concentration is in eastern Asia, with 1.7 million cases and a million deaths in 2012, mainly in China. The report said the highest ratio of cancer cases per population group are still reported in high-income countries in Europe, the Americas and Asia, but this was partly due to better access to screening and detection. Deaths, however, were proportionally much higher in low- and middle-income countries with reduced access to diagnosis and treatment. The countries with the highest death rate were Zimbabwe, Malawi, Kenya, Mongolia and Papua New Guinea. Breast and lung cancer are the two most common types in both rich and poor nations, with colorectal cancer the number three killer in developed countries, and cervical cancer in less developed ones. Cervical cancer can be staved off by vaccination against the cancer-causing Human papillomavirus (HPV), and can be easily detected through regular Papanicolaou (pap) test screens. "Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in 140 countries worldwide and cervical cancer is the most common in 39 countries, all of which are LMICs (low- and medium-income countries)," said the report. It said the global economic burden of cancer for both genders was about $286 billion (261 billion euros) in 2009, including costs for treatment and care, and loss of workforce productivity.

Big Pharma will tell you that their high drug prices are necessary for the research and development of new drugs. That is far from the truth. In actuality, data shows that pharmaceutical’s obscenely high prices are used mostly for sales and marketing. Accordingly, statistics show that most pharmaceutical companies spend much less for research and development than they do for marketing and sales. A 2013 accounting included a report on spending by Johnson and Johnson (USA), Novartis (CH), Pfizer (USA), Glaxosmithkline (GB), Merck, Sanofi, Roche, AstraZeneca, Lilly and Abbvie among the Big Pharma companies. For example, 9 out of 10 spent less on R and D than they did on sales and marketing, some far less. The biggest gulf between the two spending categories belonged to Johnson and Johnson which spent $17.5 billion for sales and marketing and $8.2 billion for research and development, well over twice as much, which meant that R and D accounted for only 32% of the total.  The remaining nine spent from 40.4% to 50.8% on R and D of a combined R and D and sales and marketing costs, from Novartis to Roche, respectively. Overall, $98.3 billion was spent on sales and marketing and 65.9 billion on R and D, making a total of $164.1 billion for the two categories. Another survey of fifteen representatives of Big Pharma show the same trend in 2014, and, in fact, their emphasis is veering from finding innovative cures to that of a consumer goods company – building brands and creating needs for these brands to make profits. There is a reason that pharmaceuticals, like many monolithic corporations, is poorly regulated and monitored by government agencies.  Pharma’s needs a small lobbying investment each year ($229 million in 2014) to assure that politicians deliver. Thus Pharma is totally free to charge what the market will bear, which means it comes out of our pockets in the form of co-pays, premiums, and bloated tax spending by government for drugs. That extra money for Pharma means less is available for other human needs, like anti-poverty programs and education. The only example of healthcare negotiating drug prices is the Veterans Administration (VA). Otherwise, pharmaceutics have their way with us. In 2014 Big Pharma spent 1.7 times more on sales and marketing (S and M) than on R and D. S and M includes a whole array of promotional tools: detailing, meetings, mailings, samples to doctors, journal and web ads, direct-to-consumer ads, medical education (cozy seminars with drug dispensers like doctors) and grants to health advocacy organizations. With this line-up it’s easy to see why R and D falls far behind in expenses, especially considering the competitive focus on promoting sales over new drugs. Our familiarity with one category of S and M is TV advertising for prescription drugs that will probably surpass $6 billion in 2016, this to build a consumer following and bolster sales. It follows that manufactured demand through advertising leads to higher prices as well. A Youtube video provides rather humorous outtakes from commercials featuring maladies and side effects we have seen ourselves with the deluge of pill-pushing on TV ads. As the video clip winds to a close, it adds to the banal and comical content by making up imaginary maladies and totally ludicrous side effects, side effects we might conjure up ourselves with equally frivolous friends. But seeing the humor does not change the power or the intent of Big Pharma. Selling drugs and making a huge profit is the number one goal, so much so that when sales of drugs flag for one illness, they invent new illnesses for the same drug. Unfortunately, the huge prices they charge have real victims. For example, NBC News told the story of Lauren Baumann, a healthy single mom who at age 26 discovered she had leukemia.  She learned that Gleevec was a medicine that would help her live. Having a full time job and health insurance, the once-a-day pill sold by Novartis would save her without endless expenses – so she thought. Even with insurance, she found, her co-pay for the drug amounted to $24,000 per year.  Such price obscenities, of course, are promoted by Big Pharma with its focus of pushing up demand in a market they totally control. Patent life for drugs is 20 years, after the drug is identified as viable in clinical trials. No one else can make or sell the medication for those 20 years. Big Parma can extend the patent period by negotiating with generic drug manufacturers, allegedly, paying them not to release their generic version. They can also find a new indication for it, giving it another life cycle as a brand name drug selling at full price for another use. If you followed drug commercials for years, you would see that Pharma finds it profitable to create new illnesses to treat with existing drugs. Eli Lilly’s example is Prozac which treated depression. In the US, annual sales the first year were $350 million and peaked at $2.6 billion a year. Then sales representative pushed doctors to prescribe Prozac for other “off label” uses like obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD),  post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), or social anxiety disorder. Before Prozac, PMDD was not even known as a disorder. With Prozac’s generic version, fluoxetine, other disorders have been added through the years like bulimia, post-partum depression, pathological laughter or crying. And we can add to that premature ejaculation because Prozac impedes sexual function. Ads selling illnesses and drugs do tend to give many viewers a sense of unease regarding their well-being.  Many critics, including conscientious doctors, feel that thousands, if not millions, are taking drugs they don’t need. This would suggest that over $100 billion now spent for sales and marketing only adds to the angst of average Americans’ lives. But for patients who need the drugs for survival, Big Pharma adds financial distress with their extremely high prices, which forces a choice between buying life-saving drugs and paying for necessities like food and shelter. For many Americans, it is a heartless choice that feckless politicians force too many of them to make. James Hoover is a recently retired systems engineer. He has advanced degrees in Economics and English. Prior to his aerospace career, he taught high school, and he has also taught college courses.

Competitor Adapt Pharma, which makes the only FDA-approved naloxone nasal spray, was quick to issue a press release that its Narcan device wasn't affected. (CNN) Merck's BACE1 inhibitor verubecestat showed early signs that it can cut production of beta amyloid in a phase I trial published in Science Translational Medicine. The drug is currently being evaluated in two phase III studies. In more BACE inhibitor news, Alzforum has coverage of the Kloster Seeon meeting in Germany. New emails divulge further details as to just how upset some FDA officials were by Janet Woodcock's decision to approve the Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug eteplirsen (Exondys 51). The loudest criticisms came from Office of Drug Evaluation director Ellis Unger, followed by Acting Chief Scientist Luciana Borio. (STAT News) And The Pink Sheet reports that eteplirsen sponsor Sarepta claimed "dire" financial pressures while pleading with the FDA for quick approval, even as it was telling investors something else entirely. The National Academies has issued a brief report on the first workshop it held since the FDA asked it for advice on how to address opioid overuse while considering the need for pain control. Biogen's nusinirsen for spinal muscular atrophy met its primary endpoint in an interim analysis of a phase III trial, the company said. The company has filed for marketing approval of the drug with both U.S. and European regulators.

All three awards, totaling around $195 million, were handed down in state court in St. Louis, Missouri, with the same judge presiding. Women or their families have filed 2,500 similar claims, the vast majority in the same court, which is one of several in the United States that attracts consumer lawsuits. The plaintiffs claim studies show J&J’s Baby Powder and Shower to Shower products, when used in the vaginal area, increase the risk of ovarian cancer. The company counters that larger, more comprehensive studies show no such link. In a court filing in August, J&J argued the case should be dismissed because plaintiffs’ lawyers tainted the St. Louis jury pool. The company said the other side spent almost $10 million on national and local television commercials in the previous year, with a disproportionate share of them running in St. Louis. The women’s lawyers have denied J&J’s claim. The company also contended that, because most of them are not from St. Louis and the New Jersey-based company has no strong ties to the area, the cases should not have been heard there. The judge rejected both arguments. John Beisner, one of the top lawyers representing J&J, said the company plans to make the same arguments to the Missouri Court of Appeals. If the St. Louis court is found not to have jurisdiction, the cases would have to be refiled elsewhere. Beisner compared the St. Louis verdicts to a favorable ruling in September from a state court judge in New Jersey. That judge, who is presiding over some 200 talc cases, disqualified the plaintiffs’ experts on the grounds that their scientific testimony was too speculative. In the same decision, he dismissed the first two cases set for trial and the ruling is being appealed. J&J unsuccessfully tried to block the testimony of the experts in St. Louis on similar grounds. The company will make the same challenge on appeal, Beisner said. Last week’s $70 million verdict followed Missouri jury awards of $72 million in February and $55 million in May. The first big talc verdict in February was won by the family of Jacqueline Fox, who died in October 2015. Their lawyers said she used J&J Baby Powder and Shower to Shower Powder daily for 35 years for genital hygiene before she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2013. Jere Beasley, whose firm has filed hundreds of talc cases, including the three Missouri wins and two New Jersey dismissals, said the verdicts should prompt J&J to make a deal. “If I were representing them, I would say, folks, we need to sit down and regroup and start trying to settle these cases,” he said. LARGE VERDICTS Large verdicts are relatively common in major product liability cases, and they are often reduced or overturned on appeal. One lawsuit against Merck & Co. over its recalled painkiller Vioxx produced a $253 million verdict in 2005, which was thrown out three years later. Merck eventually settled most Vioxx cases for $4.85 billion in 2007. Shareholders in J&J, which had sales of $70 billion last year, have so far shrugged off the three talc verdicts, the first of the cases to go to trial. But if the trend continues, liability could mount. The company has not reported setting aside any litigation reserve to deal with talc cases, as it has with previous claims over antipsychotic drug Rispardal and recalled hip implants. J&J no longer sells Shower to Shower, which was acquired by Valeant Pharmaceuticals in 2012. Though not a major seller on its own, Baby Powder is a recognized symbol of J&J’s baby care line, which brought in $2 billion in revenue in 2015. Some legal experts said it made sense for J&J to fight on. “Ordinarily I would say three verdicts like that would prompt you to think about settlement,” said University of Georgia Law School professor Elizabeth Burch, who researches product liability cases, but she said J&J’s case is somewhat different. A settlement would not necessarily cap J&J’s liability, Burch said, because its talc products are still on the market, unlike companies whose products have been recalled. Howard Erichson, a professor at Fordham School of Law, said the company also had valid concerns about the impact of a settlement on its position in the market. “This is not Vioxx. This is not asbestos,” Erichson said. “This is a case where the company wants to defend its brand, and is not going to be anxious to announce a big settlement that appears to concede that the product is harmful.

The report forecasts the global animal antibacterial and antibiotics market to grow at a CAGR of 6.5% during the period 2016-2020. Increase in investments is one of the popular trends of this market. The market is witnessing an increase in investments by various government and non-government organizations such as animal welfare associations. For instance, in 2012, the Animal Health Institute member companies invested $747 million in the R&D of new medicines for animals and the maintenance of existing products. Increased investments, especially in the underdeveloped markets of Asia and Africa, are expected to double the growth rate of the market in these regions. According to the report, demand for protein-rich diet will drive growth in the market. Globally, animal products such as milk, eggs, and meat serve a large proportion of the human population. The increase in population is fueling the growth in the demand for food, including animal-based food. Further, the rise in urbanization has created a shift in consumption patterns. Demand for nutrient-dense foods such as animal-based meat and related food items such as milk, egg, and dairy products is on a rise. Further, the report states that stringent regulatory guidelines for obtaining market approvals of animal drugs are a major hindrance to market growth. In the EU, distinct product supply rules for animal products and language barriers among member states affect the efficient and timely distribution of these drugs. For instance, in Italy, the regulations for the animal healthcare sector are more stringent than for the human healthcare sector, which hinders the regulatory approval process.

While you were sleeping: UPDATED Trump win boosts stocks, greenback Margreet Dietz Thursday November 10, 2016 Share Play NBR radio on Wall Street rose, bolstered by pharmaceutical stocks, after an upset victory for Republican candidate Donald Trump in the US presidential election. Republicans won the White House as well as both houses of Congress. "The markets were also not pricing in a Republican sweep, but now the victory makes you think maybe something can get done and the Republicans historically are against governments meddling in businesses and that's what you seeing played out today," New York-based JP Morgan Private Bank US equity strategist Nadia Lovell told Reuters. The US dollar also gained, rebounding from an overnight slide. About 85% of 62 respondents in a Reuters survey taken on Wednesday said they expected the Federal Reserve was on track to raise its key interest rate next month, its first hike in a year. At the Wall Street close,, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 256.95 points, or 1.4%, to 18,589.69. The Nasdaq Composite Index and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index both rose 1.1% to 5251.07 and 2163.26 respectively. Investors focus on benefits Investors chose to focus on the benefits from a Trump presidency, some analysts said. "At this point it is almost a Rorschach picture. If you want to be positive you can say at face value his policies are reflationary and less regulatory," David Lefkowitz, senior equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management Americas in New York, told Reuters. "The sectors that benefit from that would be in terms of reflation, it is going to be financials, and less regulation it is going to be healthcare and financials." Rallies in Pfizer and Merck shares, up 7.4% and 7% respectively, led the Dow higher. Pharmaceutical stocks posted a relief rally. The election outcome "substantially diminishes the likelihood of significant pricing reform emanating from Washington," JP Morgan analysts said. Shares of Caterpillar also surged, up 7%. Meanwhile, US Treasurys dropped amid expectations that a Trump presidency will boost spending and inflation. Yields on the 10-year note jumped 15 basis points to 2% at noon in New York. "The long end of the curve is under significant pressure for what the market believes to be the Trump platform: protectionism, retaliatory tariffs and fiscal stimulus, all of which are inflationary and bad for the dollar," Ian Lyngen, the New York-based head of US rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, told Bloomberg. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the session with a 1.5% advance from the previous close, underpinned by gains in shares of drugmakers.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 10 November 2016 | MYT 2:48 AM US stocks up 1% after shock Trump election triumph (Update 1) At midday (Wednesday), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.0%, or 185 points, at 18,518.50. The Reuters photo shows an electoral poster of Donald Trump being displayed on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange the morning after the US presidential election. NEW YORK: Wall Street stocks move solidly higher by midday Wednesday, to shrug off early losses in the wake of Republican Donald Trump’s stunning victory in the US presidential election. Markets turned positive after hesitant selling following the opening, as hopes of a pro-business agenda partially blunted the higher uncertainty. At midday (1700 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.0%, or 185 points, at 18,518.50.  The broad-based S & P 500 rose 0.7% to 2,155.48, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.6% at 5,226.00. It was a stark picture from the panic that struck futures trading just after the election results were known overnight and before the US markets opened, when Dow futures fell more than 700 points. ”The market feels the uncertainty is now over, even though many people are not happy with who won,” said Sam Stovall of CFRA. ”That ends up representing a good buying opportunity, as a lot of people have been recommending buying the dip, and when that happens, you just don’t get any dip.” Shares in sectors threatened by more regulation from a Democratic administration, like drugmakers, soared. Pfizer jumped 7.8%, Merck 6.4%, and Novartis 3.7%. Bank shares also jumped for the same reason, with JPMorgan Chase surging 4.9%, Goldman Sachs 3.4%, and Wells Fargo 5.0%. Also at the top of blue chip gainers was heavy equipment maker Caterpillar, which rocketed 7.4%, likely on hopes it would benefit from a Trump administration’s plans to sharply increase spending on US infrastructure development. Trump is also expected to offer more supportive policies to the energy industry, but oil share gains were modest, in part because oil prices remain depressed on global oversupply. Exxon Mobil rose 0.5% and Chevron gained 0.2%. ”Energy is doing better than the market but is not skyrocketing, mainly because it’s a demand issue and not a political issue that kept oil prices down,” said Stovall. Analysts remained cautious about what a Trump administration would deliver after taking office in late January. ”What people promise on the campaign trail and what actually happens are two different things,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. ”So we’re still speculating until he actually takes office and the new Congress comes.” - AFP * See also Stock market 'Trump slump' turns into rally Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Stocks , Wall Street Related Stories Trump rally falters as investors seek more clarity Post-election rally halts as energy, health stocks drag (Update 1) Losses in health, energy stocks weigh on Wall Street Nasdaq loses ground as heavyweights slump (Update 1) Dow hits new record as Trump victory drives up blue chips You May Be Interested US shale firms go back to work buoyed by Opec deal, Trump victory Oil rebounds from three-month lows on renewed hopes for OPEC cut BNM, Bank of Thailand conference on currency settlement framework Where are you on the journey to financial freedom?

Republicans won the White House as well as both chambers of Congress. "The markets were also not pricing in a Republican sweep, but now the victory makes you think maybe something can get done and the Republicans historically are against governments meddling in businesses, and that's what you seeing played out today," Nadia Lovell, US Equity Strategist at JP Morgan Private Bank in New York, told Reuters. The US dollar also gained, rebounding from an overnight slide. About 85 percent of 62 respondents in a Reuters survey taken on Wednesday they expect the Federal Reserve is on track to raise its key interest rate next month, its first hike in a year. In 1.11pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.7 percent. In 12.56pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.8 percent. Investors chose to focus on the benefits from a Trump presidency, some analysts said. “At this point it is almost a Rorschach picture. If you want to be positive you can say at face value his policies are reflationary and less regulation," David Lefkowitz, senior equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management Americas in New York, told Reuters. "The sectors that benefit from that would be in terms of reflation, it is going to be financials, and less regulation it is going to be healthcare and financials,” Lefkowitz noted. Rallies in shares of Pfizer and those of Merck, up 7.4 percent and 7 percent respectively, led the the Dow higher. Pharmaceutical stocks posted a relief rally. The election outcome “substantially diminishes the likelihood of significant pricing reform emanating from Washington," JP Morgan analysts said in a research note, according to the Wall Street Journal. Shares of Caterpillar also surged, up 7 percent. Meanwhile, US Treasuries dropped amid expectations that a Trump presidency will boost spending and inflation. Yields on the 10-year note jumped 15 basis points to 2 percent as of noon in New York. “The long end of the curve is under significant pressure for what the market believes to be the Trump platform: protectionism, retaliatory tariffs and fiscal stimulus, all of which are inflationary and bad for the dollar,” Ian Lyngen, the New York-based head of US rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, a primary dealer, told Bloomberg. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the session with a 1.5 percent advance from the previous close, underpinned by gains in shares of drugmakers. Germany’s DAX Index rose 1.6 percent, France’s CAC 40 Index increased 1.5 percent, while the UK’s FTSE 100 Index gained 1 percent.

Posted 10 Nov 2016 00:17 Updated 10 Nov 2016 01:36 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) the morning after Donald Trump won a major upset in the US presidential election. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images/AFP) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: Wall Street stocks move solidly higher by midday on Wednesday (Nov 9), to shrug off early losses in the wake of Republican Donald Trump's stunning victory in the US presidential election. Markets turned positive after hesitant selling following the opening, as hopes of a pro-business agenda partially blunted the higher uncertainty. At midday (1700 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.0 per cent, or 185 points, at 18,518.50. The broad-based S&P 500 rose 0.7 per cent to 2,155.48, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.6 per cent at 5,226.00. It was a stark picture from the panic that struck futures trading just after the election results were known overnight and before the US markets opened, when Dow futures fell more than 700 points. "The market feels the uncertainty is now over, even though many people are not happy with who won," said Sam Stovall of CFRA. "That ends up representing a good buying opportunity, as a lot of people have been recommending buying the dip, and when that happens, you just don't get any dip." Shares in sectors threatened by more regulation from a Democratic administration, like drugmakers, soared. Pfizer jumped 7.8 per cent, Merck 6.4 per cent, and Novartis 3.7 per cent. Bank shares also jumped for the same reason, with JPMorgan Chase surging 4.9 per cent, Goldman Sachs 3.4 per cent, and Wells Fargo 5.0 per cent. Also at the top of blue chip gainers was heavy equipment maker Caterpillar, which rocketed 7.4 per cent, likely on hopes it would benefit from a Trump administration's plans to sharply increase spending on US infrastructure development. Trump is also expected to offer more supportive policies to the energy industry, but oil share gains were modest, in part because oil prices remain depressed on global oversupply. Exxon Mobil rose 0.5 per cent and Chevron gained 0.2 per cent. "Energy is doing better than the market but is not skyrocketing, mainly because it's a demand issue and not a political issue that kept oil prices down," said Stovall. Analysts remained cautious about what a Trump administration would deliver after taking office in late January. "What people promise on the campaign trail and what actually happens are two different things," said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. "So we're still speculating until he actually takes office and the new Congress comes." - AFP/de Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2016 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

And while Silicon Valley may be concerned about forthcoming national tech policy, there is at least some good news within a mixed bag of results at the local level. In Florida, voters rejected an amendment that would have limited rooftop solar expansion. The proposed tweak to the state’s constitution sought to stop blanket charging for grid upkeep relating to solar installations, which could have meant that anyone with domestic solar had to pay more, or even forfeit payments for electricity fed back into the grid. The vote’s result will help ensure that solar continues to pervade in the state. Meanwhile in Nevada, voters chose to deregulate the state’s electrical market. Currently, both domestic and commercial energy supplies are provided by a single utility, NV Energy. The vote to deregulate could ultimately break its monopoly, though a second vote in 2018 is required to enact the policy. The impact of some issues that were on the ballot remains unclear. Voters in Monroe County, Florida, for example, appear to be torn over a decision on whether to approve the release of genetically modified mosquitoes to fight Zika. Initial results show that 65 percent of voters in Key Haven, the town in Monroe where the trial would take place, rejected the idea, while a countywide vote tallied 58 percent in favor of it. The vote is non-binding, so the Florida Keys Mosquito Control Board will now ultimately decide whether to proceed. Early indications also suggest that Seattle looks likely to approve its Sound Transit 3 plan. The $54 billion scheme is an ambitious proposal to reform the city’s transport systems, laying 62 new miles of new light rail network and building 37 new train stations in order to cut congestion and pollution. But some critics have argued that the plan may turn out to be obsolete before it even gets started if autonomous cars deliver on their promise of transforming city traffic problems. And then, of course, some states have voted against measures that may have created a positive impact. While the final results aren’t yet in, predictions suggest that California appears to have defied expectations and voted against a policy intended to cut drug prices. The state’s Proposition 61 was meant to stop health plans from paying any more than the discounted prices that are offered to the Department of Veterans Affairs by pharmaceutical companies. (A $109 million campaign funded by Merck, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson probably helped as well.) Perhaps most disappointing, though, is the news that Washington State voters chose to reject the country’s first carbon tax. The levy, the likes of which has already been approved in Canada, would have started at $15 per metric ton of carbon dioxide, steadily rising to $100 in the coming years. But the policy proved controversial. In fact, even environmentalists had chosen to oppose the measure, partly over concerns that it didn’t go far enough in raising money for renewable energy schemes. A mixed result for innovation policy among the states, then. Now we just need to see what happens at the federal level.

(Reuters/Carlo Allegri) Share Written by Leslie Josephs Obsession 2016 November 09, 2016 Investors are sending a signal about Donald Trump’s campaign promises: We believe. Markets have steadied from an overnight tumble that kicked off when the Republican nominee began to morph into the president-elect of the United States. But drama is gripping some very particular sectors: pharma, guns, steel and coal. Coal and steel producers surged. Trump pushed aggressively into US coal country, which he handedly won and has complained about cheap foreign steel and aluminum undercutting US producers, despite questions about supplies used to build Trump-branded hotels. US Steel shares jumped more than 14%. Coal producer Alliance Resource Partners rose 12%. Aluminium producer Alcoa rose nearly 5%. Trump has also promised to spend big on infrastructure, sending shares of construction companies and equipment makers higher. For example, Caterpillar shares rose more than 6%. Drugmakers also surged. Shares of pharmaceutical companies had plunged last year following comments from Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton on price gouging in the sector. Pfizer rose 7% and Merck gained 3.4%. But gun shares tumbled as Trump’s victory all but scraps the chances for significant curbs on sales. Smith & Wesson shares shed nearly 12% by mid-morning trade; Sturm, Ruger fell close to 13%. These stocks often rise on the heels of mass shootings, such as the Orlando nightclub shooting in June, since such acts of violence drum up worries of stricter rules governing gun control, a shift that could cause consumers to stockpile weapons. One of Trump’s biggest supporters has been the National Rifle Association. Gun sales surged, to two million a month (paywall), following Barack Obama’s re-election and the Sandy Hook massacre. Do keep in mind: the day after the election is a day for knee-jerk reactions. Without a highly-detailed plan on how Trump will follow through on these promises, these sectors could easily turn.

Ogg November 9, 2016 8:40 am EST Print Email Tweet The world is more than surprised that Donald Trump has scored an upset victory over rival Hillary Clinton. Many brokerage firms and economists said that a Trump victory would be awful for stocks, with an immediate correction, but the initial 700-point Dow Jones Industrial Average selling in overnight futures was last seen down only 290 points. UPDATE: This post was edited for closing bell prices as many prices changed for even stronger gains. 24/7 Wall St. has identified several immediate winners from a Donald Trump presidency. These are all surging higher, but there are other winners as well. Trump is deemed to be positive for gold over uncertainty and positive for defense stocks based on the promise to rebuild America’s military. Then there are the infrastructure stocks, and the metals stocks that will theoretically win if they are treated fairly inside and outside of America. Pharmaceuticals may do well selectively also, if the ability for a Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton attack over pricing is off the table. Coal and Energy were not moving as much as some investors might have expected. There are of course other companies that should be viewed positively, but there are probably too many to count in the wee hours of the morning. There will also be the list of big losers that would have surged under a Clinton victory. Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: ARIA) saw its shares slide after Bernie Sanders went after it for price hikes. While many drug or pharmaceutical stocks will be up, Sanders had effectively gone after Ariad over greed when the reality is that it is still losing money. Ariad also has about $1.4 billion worth of negative retained earnings. The stock has a 52-week trading range of $4.37 to $14.34, with a consensus analyst price target of $13.05. Update for close: closed up 23% at $11.43 on 19.5 million shares. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) was the first and most obvious winner of our prior Trump-Clinton infrastructure winners. Caterpillar shares were last seen up 2.5% at $86.85, after having risen 1.1% the prior day. Caterpillar has a consensus price target of $80.70 and a 52-week range of $56.36 to $89.87. Update for close: Caterpillar closed up 7.7% at $91.20 on 18.7 million shares. Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE: LMT) was last seen up 4% at $248.75 after Trump’s win as he has said numerous times that he wants to rebuild America’s military. With recent plane contracts in a take it or leave it mode, there are hopes or assumptions the JSF contract will be more favorable now. Lockheed Martin has a consensus price target of $267.76. The 52-week range is $200.47 to $266.93. Update for close: Lockheed Martin closed up 5.9% at $253.36 on almost 4 million shares. Nucor Corp. (NYSE: NUE) was another obvious winner due to steel and infrastructure. Nucor is also considered an advanced metals company, and the company should be prepared to win if tariffs and other protections are afforded to U.S. companies over foreign companies. Nucor has a 52-week range of $33.90 to $57.08. The consensus price target is $52.25. Update for close: Nucor closed up 12.1% at $57.60 on over 8.7 million shares.

By CiaraLinnane Corporate news editor EmmaCourt Reporter Early-morning election results upended health care stocks in Wednesday morning trade, lifting drug manufacturers and sending health insurers down in a reversal of trends and Wall Street expectations prior to the election. President-elect Donald Trump has said he plans to “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act, though his specific replacement plan remains unclear, fomenting uncertainty for health insurers. The president-elect’s position on regulating drug prices similarly remains uncertain. Still, Trump’s victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton — who has been very critical of drug companies and was expected to pursue sector regulation — along with the Republican party’s Congressional sweep were a boon for pharmaceutical and biotech companies’ stocks early Wednesday. Biotech investors had previously been cautious about the sector, fearing a Democratic sweep on election day, according to a Leerink Partners report. The Republican Party’s triple win means “the worst possible outcome for [health care] stocks is a reality,” said Mizuho analyst Sheryl Skolnick, since eliminating the ACA would have tremendous implications across “virtually every sub-sector“ and “we have no idea what will replace it.” “The unthinkable has happened,” said Leerink analyst Ana Gupte. An ACA repeal would also leave 20 million people without health insurance, and end popular provisions such as free birth control and young adults’ coverage on their parents’ health insurance plans through age 26. Despite some hints during the campaign, the effects of a Trump presidency on health care are ultimately anyone’s guess, many Wednesday reports concluded. “Trump’s candidacy raised more questions about his healthcare proposals than it provided answers,” said a PwC report. “These economic uncertainties place significant cost pressures on industry stakeholders.” Republican political control does not necessarily mean “that the healthcare regulatory landscape will return to a 2008-like reality,” said a Height Securities report Wednesday. “The burden of governance means that Republicans must replace the ACA with something as it is political suicide to kick 20 million Americans...to the proverbial curb.” Mylan CEO: EpiPen $608 Price Was 'Fair'(3:04) Mylan CEO Heather Bresch responds to questions from the House Oversight Committee regarding costs of the EpiPen. The company raised the list price of the allergy medication 548% over the last nine years, reigniting public outrage over drug prices. Photo: Getty In addition, “we believe the ongoing debate in Washington over drug pricing is essentially over,” the Height Securities report said. See: Donald Trump’s ‘Access Hollywood’ tape may have cost biotech investors $50 billion Trump has also said that he would allow health insurers to compete across state lines, which he said would keep costs down and allow Americans with pre-existing conditions — who have gained coverage thanks to the ACA — to continue to have health insurance. Health experts have disagreed with his assessment. Legalizing interstate competition would have far-reaching implications for the sector, said Mickey Levy, chief economist for the Americas and Asia at Berenberg. Read more: Donald Trump had the answer to that debate question about Obamacare... on his website Though health care and other sectors are “poised for a sell-off,” Leerink’s Gupte recommended buying “on weakness” stocks such as Humana HUM, +2.92% UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH, +4.00% Cigna CI, +1.83%  and Universal Health Services Inc. UHS, +2.03% Anthem Inc. ANTM, +3.68% Centene Corp. CNC, +1.76%  and Molina Healthcare Inc. MOH, +5.05%  should “face uncertainty and policy headwinds...in the years ahead,” Gupte said. Among Dow Jones Industrial Average components, Pfizer Inc. PFE, -0.64% was the biggest gainer, rallying 8.0%, Merck & Co. Inc. MRK, -0.66%  jumped 4.4% and Johnson & JNJ, -1.58%  gained 4.2%. The health care subsector of the S&P 500 rose 2.9% , and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF XLV, -0.31%  was up 2.9%. Hospital operator Tenet Healthcare THC, +12.71% which operates acute care hospitals, plummeted 23.7%. Acute care facilities, which “already face multiple headwinds under the current policy and political environment, will now become further disadvantaged as ObamaCare unravels,” Leerink’s Gupte said. UnitedHealth, the nation’s biggest health insurer, tumbled as much as 4% pre-market, subsequently evening out to a 0.7% decline in morning trade. UnitedHealth said earlier this year it would retreat from most ACA marketplaces next year. Away from the Dow, Mylan N.V. MYL, +1.34% the maker of the EpiPen that has been under heavy fire for hiking the price of that lifesaving allergic-reaction treatment, rallied 5.7%. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. VRX, -2.50% jumped as much as 4.8% pre-market, and was up 1.3% in morning trade. By comparison, S&P SPX, -0.01%  futures were down 1.2%.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Non-Insulin Therapies for Diabetes: GLP-1 Agonists, DPP4 Inhibitors and SGLT2 Inhibitors, 2016 – 2026 LONDON, Nov. 8, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — INTRODUCTION Diabetes, considered to be the most common metabolic disorder in humans, is ranked among the top ten fatal diseases in the US. The increasing incidence, growing prevalence and the progressive nature of the disease has spurred several pharmaceutical companies to develop novel approaches / therapies to provide better treatment options for diabetic patients worldwide. While insulin supplements and insulin based therapies represent a major portion of the anti-diabetic drugs market, non-insulin therapies are first line therapies designed especially for patients suffering from type II diabetes. Sulfonylureas, biguanides, glinides, TZDs and alpha- glucosidase inhibitors were the first classes of non-insulin therapies to hit the market. Subsequently, incretin based therapies, such as GLP-1 agonists and DPP4 inhibitors, emerged as the standard of care for the treatment of type II diabetes. More recently, SGLT2 inhibitors have also been identified as an effective treatment solution for the same patient population. These three classes have captured a significant portion of the overall anti-diabetes market in a relatively short time span. GLP-1 agonists and DPP4 inhibitors were introduced in the market over a decade ago while the first SGLT2 inhibitor was approved only in 2012. A number of drugs have emerged as blockbusters; examples include VICTOZA® (GLP-1 agonist), JANUVIA® / JANUMET® (DPP4 inhibitor) and INVOKANA® / INVOKAMET® (SGLT2 inhibitor). Several companies, including both big pharmaceutical players and small to mid-sized companies, are active in this area. Companies engaged in developing anti-diabetic drug classes have actively entered into collaborations with other stakeholders to either acquire / develop / commercialize candidate therapies or for technology licensing. For instance, Tobira acquired the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize evogliptin from Dong-A ST in April 2016; Eli Lilly and Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma entered into a sales collaboration agreement for Trulicity® in July 2015; Novo Nordisk in-licensed Zosano’s technology to develop a transdermal patch formulation of Novo’s GLP-1 analogs, including semaglutide in February 2014; Takeda and Sanofi signed a co-promotion agreement for alogliptin in China in April 2013. Recently issued FDA warnings specifically for DPP4 and SGLT2 inhibitors are likely to impact their adoption. However, new advances in drug development and the introduction of novel technologies are expected to help stakeholders operate within a proper framework and work towards eliminating the current gaps. SCOPE OF THE REPORT The “Non-Insulin Therapies for Diabetes: GLP-1 Agonists, DPP4 Inhibitors and SGLT2 Inhibitors, 2016-2026” report provides a comprehensive analysis of the current market landscape of these therapies and an informed opinion on how the market is likely to evolve over the next decade. The anti-diabetic drugs market broadly comprises of insulin and non-insulin therapies. Non-insulin therapies are further classified under various categories based on their respective mechanisms of action. Of the different types of non-insulin therapies, GLP-1 agonists, DPP4 inhibitors and SGLT2 inhibitors have been the most popular in the last few years. As mentioned earlier, these therapeutic classes have captured the attention of a number of pharmaceutical companies and drug developers worldwide. Several companies, including pharmaceutical giants, mid-sized players and start-ups, have come up with innovative technologies and novel formulations of these drug classes. Such advances have generated and sustained significant momentum in this segment of the industry. Specifically, GLP-1 agonists, which have been researched for several years, have a rich pipeline of clinical and preclinical molecules. DPP4 inhibitors currently have a relatively larger market share; however, they are now giving way to other relatively newer and emerging classes such as SGLT2 inhibitors. During the course of our study, we identified over 80 molecules belonging to these three drugs classes. More than 70% of the candidates are currently under clinical / preclinical development; the efforts are actively being led by several companies. Focused primarily on these three classes of drugs, this report features: – An overview of the market landscape highlighting important details on each molecule such as key players, current phase of product development, route of administration and dosage regime. – Detailed profiles of drugs that have been recently approved / marketed or are in the late stages of development. – A list of key opinion leaders (KOLs) who were involved in the discovery and development of GLP-1 agonists, DPP4 inhibitors and SGLT2 inhibitors. – An analysis of recently published clinical trial data depicting the prevalent trends and technical developments that have taken place in the industry. – A discussion on the potential side effects and warnings issued by regulatory authorities suggesting areas of improvement / guidance for future drug development. – A list of upcoming non-insulin novel therapies that are currently in early stages of development and likely to become a part of the anti-diabetic drugs market in the near future. The report also provides an estimate of the likely future size of the non-insulin therapies for diabetes.

With a current total / combined share of more than 70% in the overall non-insulin market, GLP-1 agonists, DPP4 inhibitors and SGLT2 inhibitors represent the three most prominent anti-diabetic drug classes. In terms of size, currently, the market of GLP-1 agonists, DPP4 inhibitors and SGLT2 inhibitors is worth over USD 4 billion, USD 10 billion and USD 2 billion respectively. Overall, the market is highly fragmented and well distributed across different regions. 2. Combined, the three drug classes have over 20 approved drugs (accounting around 40 different formulations / fixed-dose combinations) for the treatment of type II diabetes. In addition, the clinical / preclinical pipeline is rich and has over 70 molecules in different stages of development. Of the three classes, DPP4 inhibitors currently has the maximum number of marketed drugs (over 10, excluding fixed-dose combinations). On the other hand, GLP-1 agonists represent the most active class of drugs with over 40 molecules under development. SGLT2 inhibitors are also emerging at a rapid pace and already have six marketed drugs across different regions. Semaglutide (Novo Nordisk), ITCA 650 (Intarcia Therapeutics), sotagliflozin (Sanofi / Lexicon Pharmaceuticals), ertugliflozin (Merck / Pfizer), retagliptin (Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine) and gosogliptin (SatRx / Pfizer) are examples of late stage drugs that are likely to receive approval in the near future. 3. Overall we came across over 80 pharmaceutical companies actively engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of non-insulin therapies. Established pharmaceutical players have captured a major share of the non-insulin anti-diabetic drugs market. In fact, AstraZeneca, BMS, Eli Lilly and Sanofi are developing non-insulin therapies across all the three drug classes. Several other companies such as Daiichi Sankyo, Janssen, Merck, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, Sanofi, Takeda and Zealand Pharma have invested heavily in the development of multiple molecules belonging to these drug classes. A number of start-ups / small companies such as (in alphabetical order) Alteogen, Amunix, ArisGen, C4XD, Diartis Pharmaceuticals, Oramed Pharmaceutical, PegBio, Poxel, Rani Therapeutics, Receptos, SatRx, Sirona Biochem and Spitfire Pharma have entered this space and are also competing to gain a significant share in the overall non-insulin therapies market. 4. In addition to increased competition of such therapies in the major geographies such as the US and EU, some stakeholders have focused on tapping a localized opportunity. Drugs such as teneligliptin (Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma), trelagliptin (Takeda), ipragliflozin (Astellas Pharma/ Kotobuki Pharmaceutical) and luseogliflozin (Taisho Pharmaceutical) have been approved only in Japan. Similarly, retagliptin (Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine) and Uni-E4 (Uni-Bio Science Group) are in Phase III clinical development in China only. 5. With a vision to increase patient compliance, several pharmaceutical companies have introduced fixed-dose formulations of different drugs. Prominent examples include Eucreas® / Galvumet® / Galvus Met® / Icandra® / Zomarist® (vildagliptin + metformin) (Novartis), INVOKAMET® / VOKANAMET® (canagliflozin + metformin) (Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies / Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma / Daiichi Sankyo), JANUMET® / Velmetia® (sitagliptin + metformin) (Merck), Xigdua® (dapagliflozin + metformin) (Astra Zeneca / BMS) and Xultophy® / IDegLira (liraglutide + insulin degludec) (Novo Nordisk). 6. Technological advancements are amongst the key future growth drivers. Drug developers are investigating new routes of administration using several innovative technology platforms, such as Axcess™ (Diabetology), Eligen® (Emisphere Technologies), PharmFilm® Technology (MonoSol Rx) and the Protein Oral Delivery (POD™) technology (Oramed Pharmaceuticals), to facilitate the oral administration of GLP-1 agonists. Other innovative technologies such as the Intravail® drug delivery platform are attempting to facilitate nasal administration. Companies such as ScinoPharm and Panacea Biotech are developing oral capsule formulations of DPP4 inhibitors. Their molecules, DBPR108 and PBL 1427, respectively, are still in the early stages of clinical development. SGLT2 inhibitors, primarily used to treat type II diabetes, are also being developed for the treatment of type I diabetes. Examples include sotagliflozin (Theracos) and remogliflozin (BHV Pharma). 7. Dual agonist drugs are also being developed to provide more effective treatment options. Examples of molecules that target both the GLP-1 receptor and glucagon receptor include MK-8521 (Merck), TTP401 / LY2944876 (Transition Therapeutics / Eli Lilly), MEDI0382 (AstraZeneca), SAR425899 (Sanofi) and MOD-6030 / MOD-6031 (OPKO Biologics). On the other hand, NN9709 (Novo Nordisk) and SAR438335 (Sanofi) are being developed to act on both GLP-1 and GIP receptors. 8. Several research institutes, companies and organization have made significant contribution to the discovery and overall development of these therapies. During the study, we identified over 400 key opinion leaders who have played critical role in the development of GLP-1 agonists, DPP4 inhibitors and SGLT2 inhibitors. In addition, we identified over 50 articles, published during the 12 months beginning January 2015, which focused on these three drug classes. The design of these studies primarily focussed on evaluating the safety, efficacy, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drugs. 9. Extensive efforts are being made by pharmaceutical companies to explore new and innovative therapeutic strategies and agents that are safer and more effective than the already available options. Many novel non-insulin therapies are under clinical development. Examples of these new anti-diabetic drug classes include glucokinase activators, GPR119 agonists, GCGR antagonists, 11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 inhibitors, glycogen phosphorylase inhibitors and PTP-1B antagonists. 10. It is important to highlight that nearing patent expiries of currently available drugs and the potential health hazards associated with the use of some of these inhibitors are going to negatively impact the market growth. However, our overall outlook is highly promising. We believe that SGLT2 inhibitors are likely to grow at an annualized growth rate of ~17%, followed by GLP-1 agonists (expected growth rate of ~13.4%).

The increasing incidence, growing prevalence and the progressive nature of the disease has spurred several pharmaceutical companies to develop novel approaches / therapies to provide better treatment options for diabetic patients worldwide. While insulin supplements and insulin based therapies represent a major portion of the anti-diabetic drugs market, non-insulin therapies are first line therapies designed especially for patients suffering from type II diabetes. Sulfonylureas, biguanides, glinides, TZDs and alpha- glucosidase inhibitors were the first classes of non-insulin therapies to hit the market. Subsequently, incretin based therapies, such as GLP-1 agonists and DPP4 inhibitors, emerged as the standard of care for the treatment of type II diabetes. More recently, SGLT2 inhibitors have also been identified as an effective treatment solution for the same patient population. These three classes have captured a significant portion of the overall anti-diabetes market in a relatively short time span. GLP-1 agonists and DPP4 inhibitors were introduced in the market over a decade ago while the first SGLT2 inhibitor was approved only in 2012. A number of drugs have emerged as blockbusters; examples include VICTOZA® (GLP-1 agonist), JANUVIA® / JANUMET® (DPP4 inhibitor) and INVOKANA® / INVOKAMET® (SGLT2 inhibitor). Several companies, including both big pharmaceutical players and small to mid-sized companies, are active in this area. Companies engaged in developing anti-diabetic drug classes have actively entered into collaborations with other stakeholders to either acquire / develop / commercialize candidate therapies or for technology licensing. For instance, Tobira acquired the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize evogliptin from Dong-A ST in April 2016; Eli Lilly and Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma entered into a sales collaboration agreement for Trulicity® in July 2015; Novo Nordisk in-licensed Zosano's technology to develop a transdermal patch formulation of Novo's GLP-1 analogs, including semaglutide in February 2014; Takeda and Sanofi signed a co-promotion agreement for alogliptin in China in April 2013. Recently issued FDA warnings specifically for DPP4 and SGLT2 inhibitors are likely to impact their adoption. However, new advances in drug development and the introduction of novel technologies are expected to help stakeholders operate within a proper framework and work towards eliminating the current gaps. SCOPE OF THE REPORT The "Non-Insulin Therapies for Diabetes: GLP-1 Agonists, DPP4 Inhibitors and SGLT2 Inhibitors, 2016-2026" report provides a comprehensive analysis of the current market landscape of these therapies and an informed opinion on how the market is likely to evolve over the next decade. The anti-diabetic drugs market broadly comprises of insulin and non-insulin therapies. Non-insulin therapies are further classified under various categories based on their respective mechanisms of action. Of the different types of non-insulin therapies, GLP-1 agonists, DPP4 inhibitors and SGLT2 inhibitors have been the most popular in the last few years. As mentioned earlier, these therapeutic classes have captured the attention of a number of pharmaceutical companies and drug developers worldwide. Several companies, including pharmaceutical giants, mid-sized players and start-ups, have come up with innovative technologies and novel formulations of these drug classes. Such advances have generated and sustained significant momentum in this segment of the industry. Specifically, GLP-1 agonists, which have been researched for several years, have a rich pipeline of clinical and preclinical molecules. DPP4 inhibitors currently have a relatively larger market share; however, they are now giving way to other relatively newer and emerging classes such as SGLT2 inhibitors. During the course of our study, we identified over 80 molecules belonging to these three drugs classes. More than 70% of the candidates are currently under clinical / preclinical development; the efforts are actively being led by several companies. Focused primarily on these three classes of drugs, this report features: - An overview of the market landscape highlighting important details on each molecule such as key players, current phase of product development, route of administration and dosage regime. - Detailed profiles of drugs that have been recently approved / marketed or are in the late stages of development. - A list of key opinion leaders (KOLs) who were involved in the discovery and development of GLP-1 agonists, DPP4 inhibitors and SGLT2 inhibitors. - An analysis of recently published clinical trial data depicting the prevalent trends and technical developments that have taken place in the industry. - A discussion on the potential side effects and warnings issued by regulatory authorities suggesting areas of improvement / guidance for future drug development. - A list of upcoming non-insulin novel therapies that are currently in early stages of development and likely to become a part of the anti-diabetic drugs market in the near future.

With a current total / combined share of more than 70% in the overall non-insulin market, GLP-1 agonists, DPP4 inhibitors and SGLT2 inhibitors represent the three most prominent anti-diabetic drug classes. In terms of size, currently, the market of GLP-1 agonists, DPP4 inhibitors and SGLT2 inhibitors is worth over USD 4 billion, USD 10 billion and USD 2 billion respectively. Overall, the market is highly fragmented and well distributed across different regions. 2. Combined, the three drug classes have over 20 approved drugs (accounting around 40 different formulations / fixed-dose combinations) for the treatment of type II diabetes. In addition, the clinical / preclinical pipeline is rich and has over 70 molecules in different stages of development. Of the three classes, DPP4 inhibitors currently has the maximum number of marketed drugs (over 10, excluding fixed-dose combinations). On the other hand, GLP-1 agonists represent the most active class of drugs with over 40 molecules under development. SGLT2 inhibitors are also emerging at a rapid pace and already have six marketed drugs across different regions. Semaglutide (Novo Nordisk), ITCA 650 (Intarcia Therapeutics), sotagliflozin (Sanofi / Lexicon Pharmaceuticals), ertugliflozin (Merck / Pfizer), retagliptin (Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine) and gosogliptin (SatRx / Pfizer) are examples of late stage drugs that are likely to receive approval in the near future. 3. Overall we came across over 80 pharmaceutical companies actively engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of non-insulin therapies. Established pharmaceutical players have captured a major share of the non-insulin anti-diabetic drugs market. In fact, AstraZeneca, BMS, Eli Lilly and Sanofi are developing non-insulin therapies across all the three drug classes. Several other companies such as Daiichi Sankyo, Janssen, Merck, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, Sanofi, Takeda and Zealand Pharma have invested heavily in the development of multiple molecules belonging to these drug classes. A number of start-ups / small companies such as (in alphabetical order) Alteogen, Amunix, ArisGen, C4XD, Diartis Pharmaceuticals, Oramed Pharmaceutical, PegBio, Poxel, Rani Therapeutics, Receptos, SatRx, Sirona Biochem and Spitfire Pharma have entered this space and are also competing to gain a significant share in the overall non-insulin therapies market. 4. In addition to increased competition of such therapies in the major geographies such as the US and EU, some stakeholders have focused on tapping a localized opportunity. Drugs such as teneligliptin (Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma), trelagliptin (Takeda), ipragliflozin (Astellas Pharma/ Kotobuki Pharmaceutical) and luseogliflozin (Taisho Pharmaceutical) have been approved only in Japan. Similarly, retagliptin (Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine) and Uni-E4 (Uni-Bio Science Group) are in Phase III clinical development in China only. 5. With a vision to increase patient compliance, several pharmaceutical companies have introduced fixed-dose formulations of different drugs. Prominent examples include Eucreas® / Galvumet® / Galvus Met® / Icandra® / Zomarist® (vildagliptin + metformin) (Novartis), INVOKAMET® / VOKANAMET® (canagliflozin + metformin) (Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies / Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma / Daiichi Sankyo), JANUMET® / Velmetia® (sitagliptin + metformin) (Merck), Xigdua® (dapagliflozin + metformin) (Astra Zeneca / BMS) and Xultophy® / IDegLira (liraglutide + insulin degludec) (Novo Nordisk). 6. Technological advancements are amongst the key future growth drivers. Drug developers are investigating new routes of administration using several innovative technology platforms, such as Axcess™ (Diabetology), Eligen® (Emisphere Technologies), PharmFilm® Technology (MonoSol Rx) and the Protein Oral Delivery (POD™) technology (Oramed Pharmaceuticals), to facilitate the oral administration of GLP-1 agonists. Other innovative technologies such as the Intravail® drug delivery platform are attempting to facilitate nasal administration. Companies such as ScinoPharm and Panacea Biotech are developing oral capsule formulations of DPP4 inhibitors. Their molecules, DBPR108 and PBL 1427, respectively, are still in the early stages of clinical development. SGLT2 inhibitors, primarily used to treat type II diabetes, are also being developed for the treatment of type I diabetes. Examples include sotagliflozin (Theracos) and remogliflozin (BHV Pharma). 7. Dual agonist drugs are also being developed to provide more effective treatment options. Examples of molecules that target both the GLP-1 receptor and glucagon receptor include MK-8521 (Merck), TTP401 / LY2944876 (Transition Therapeutics / Eli Lilly), MEDI0382 (AstraZeneca), SAR425899 (Sanofi) and MOD-6030 / MOD-6031 (OPKO Biologics). On the other hand, NN9709 (Novo Nordisk) and SAR438335 (Sanofi) are being developed to act on both GLP-1 and GIP receptors. 8. Several research institutes, companies and organization have made significant contribution to the discovery and overall development of these therapies. During the study, we identified over 400 key opinion leaders who have played critical role in the development of GLP-1 agonists, DPP4 inhibitors and SGLT2 inhibitors. In addition, we identified over 50 articles, published during the 12 months beginning January 2015, which focused on these three drug classes. The design of these studies primarily focussed on evaluating the safety, efficacy, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drugs. 9. Extensive efforts are being made by pharmaceutical companies to explore new and innovative therapeutic strategies and agents that are safer and more effective than the already available options. Many novel non-insulin therapies are under clinical development. Examples of these new anti-diabetic drug classes include glucokinase activators, GPR119 agonists, GCGR antagonists, 11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 inhibitors, glycogen phosphorylase inhibitors and PTP-1B antagonists. 10. It is important to highlight that nearing patent expiries of currently available drugs and the potential health hazards associated with the use of some of these inhibitors are going to negatively impact the market growth. However, our overall outlook is highly promising. We believe that SGLT2 inhibitors are likely to grow at an annualized growth rate of ~17%, followed by GLP-1 agonists (expected growth rate of ~13.4%).

Johnson November 8 Follow @carolynyjohnson The ballot initiative drawing the most spending on the November ballot would not affect the average Californian, but drug companies have a major stake and are spending heavily to defeat it. (Alicia Chang/AP) The pharmaceutical industry will be closely watching a different tight election race today — a California drug price referendum that has drawn $109 million in opposition funding and could have ripple effects beyond the state if it passes. The ballot initiative, Proposition 61, seeks to piggyback on the prescription drug discounts enjoyed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, requiring most state-funded health insurance programs to pay no more for drugs than VA. The ballot measure affects only drug coverage for a fraction of Californians, who account for about $3.8 billion in drug spending. But its merits and potential unintended consequences have been fiercely debated because of the possibility that the measure could be replicated in other states or trigger more efforts to control drug prices. Proposition 61 has been the most searched state measure in the past day, according to Google. Pharmaceutical companies have bankrolled a large part of the opposition campaign, and they've outspent supporters mightily, raising about six times as much money. But recent polling on the measure revealed that voters are sharply divided. The rhetoric is high on both sides, and there are many uncertainties about the potential effects of the legislation — including the basic question of how much money it would actually save, if any — and how it would be implemented. [Bernie Sanders wants to know why this cancer drug costs nearly $200,000 a year] Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) has supported the measure, calling it a “chance to stand up to the pharmaceutical industry's greed and spark a national movement” in an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times. Meanwhile, drugmakers are fighting it “tooth and nail,” Eli Lilly chief executive John Lechleiter said in an earnings call in October. “It's not only bad legislation, it's bad for your health,” Lechleiter said. “And we're trying to impress that on the voters.” Beyond drug companies, a large coalition of organizations opposes the legislation, as well as many newspaper editorial boards. VA is entitled to a rebate of at least 24 percent off the average manufacturer price and is insulated against price increases that outpace inflation. A brief analysis published in the British Medical Journal  last month examined the possible cost savings, if the measure passed, for one of the state-funded health programs, Medi-Cal fee-for-service, which spent roughly $1.8 billion on drugs in 2014. Harvard Medical School researchers studied the top 200 drugs used in the program. A third of those drugs would be cheaper if VA price were applied, and they estimated that getting VA price applied to those drugs could save about $100 to $125 million in 2014. But the authors also noted that the long-term effects of the legislation were unclear since the pharmaceutical industry could respond by raising prices on VA and others. The state's Legislative Analyst's Office, a nonpartisan agency that provides fiscal advice to the legislature, concluded in an analysis that the measure could generate an “unknown” amount of savings that could range from “relatively little effect to significant annual savings.” The effect of the measure was deemed uncertain because of implementation challenges and the possibility that drugmakers would raise other prices in response. [Why treating diabetes keeps getting more expensive] The initiative would apply to only a relatively small portion of California's population — about 5 million people — but it's being closely watched because of California's position as a leader in policy reform. “If every other state followed California's example, we’re talking about a substantially bigger potential impact, and then the other issue is . . . could you extend this logic to Medicare, another public payer,” said Thomas Hwang, a researcher at Harvard Medical School. “So the fear of a precedent is one way to contextualize” it. In recent earnings calls, drug companies have called out the legislation. Merck chief executive Kenneth Frazier said, “We're very active in opposing it.” Joaquin Duato, executive vice president of Johnson & Johnson, said it would create “access barriers” for patients. Pfizer's chief executive, Ian Read, said it was “basically untenable.” “It's asking for an industry that has given noncommercial prices to the veterans for a very good reason — they are a special part of our society, and we've given noncommercial prices to that part of society.

About Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Syndax is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing an innovative pipeline of combination therapies in multiple cancer indications. Our lead product candidate, entinostat, which was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA following positive results from our Phase 2b clinical trial, ENCORE 301, is currently being evaluated in a Phase 3 registration clinical trial for advanced hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative breast cancer. Syndax is developing entinostat, which has direct effects on both cancer cells and immune regulatory cells, and SNDX-6352, an anti-CSF-1R monoclonal antibody, to potentially enhance the body’s immune response on tumors that have shown sensitivity to immunotherapy. Entinostat is being evaluated as a combination therapeutic in Phase 1b/2 clinical trials with Merck & Co., Inc. for non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma, with Genentech, Inc. for TNBC, and with Pfizer Inc. and Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, for ovarian cancer. SNDX-6352 is expected to begin clinical trials during the fourth quarter of 2016 and to be developed to treat a variety of cancers. For more information on Syndax, please visit www.syndax.com.

If readers look at the above chart, "Health Care Distributors" looks to be the trouble spot, with companies in that category reporting just 25% of those company's reporting better-than-consensus revenue. 75% of thise companies missed their revenue estimates. The real issue is what happens to Health Care in 2017: here is a quick table of the Health Care sectors "expected" 2017 earnings growth: 11/4/16: +8.8% 10/28/16: +9.5% 10/21/16: +10% 10/14/16: +10.1% 10/7/16: +10.2% 9/30/16: +10.2% 9/23/16: +10.3% While there is some downward pressure as long as the numbers stay above "mid-single-digits" HealthCare should be ok. CVS's guide-down this morning was a shocker. Although the stock is found in Consumer Staples, CVS is tied to the Health Care sector, and the warning around the retail drug segment for 2017 wasn't good. I expected the PBM to be under pressure, not the retail drug segment, Clients are currently "underweight" Health care with the largest position being Pfizer (PFE). Clients do own a little IBB, and some IHE, and PPH, but the positions are small right now. How Prop 61 does tonight in California and the composition of the Senate, will matter. It is price controls that is the biggest risk over the next year. Bristol-Meyers (BMY) has gotten crushed, Pfizer is down from $38 to $31, and testing its uptrend line, Merck is acting very well, I do think there is value in the old-school large-cap pharma stocks.
