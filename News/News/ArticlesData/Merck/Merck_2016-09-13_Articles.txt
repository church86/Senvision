This decision comes after last summer’s announcement that NMPF and Merck Animal Health would collaborate to help ensure a comprehensive, dairy industry-wide approach to employee training and animal care. This partnership has given dairy producers across the country unprecedented access to the tools, resources and workshops available through the Merck Animal Health Dairy C.A.R.E. Initiative, and it will also produce 10 upcoming webinars on various animal care topics, including calf care, stockmanship, antimicrobial stewardship and more. “Merck’s proactive, engaging partnership has greatly strengthened the FARM Animal Care Program and we are grateful for their support for the program again this year,” said NMPF Chief of Staff Emily Meredith, who also leads the FARM Program. “These webinars, hosted by Merck Animal Health and leading animal health and welfare experts, will provide valuable training resources to producers and their employees.” “Dairy C.A.R.E. was developed to help producers provide the best animal care by maintaining sound policies, hiring the right people and making sure they are properly trained – and our partnership with NMPF is a natural fit,” said Rick Jackson, Merck Animal Health U.S. dairy product manager. “The new webinar series helps us meet our goal of offering supplemental materials dairy farmers can use to meet the new requirements under FARM Version 3.0 while supporting the significant efforts of dairy producers to continuously improve the care and handling of their animals.” The video topics and release dates are available here.

The objective of the DiViNe project is to create an integrated, cost-effective purification programme specifically tailored for vaccines that achieves higher yields while preserving product integrity. Mercks specific focus will be on simplifying the process of vaccine purification that typically relies on affinity chromatography, a method of capturing antibodies. In support of this goal, the company will be providing chromatographic materials and coupling technologies. 'Purification steps represent significant manufacturing costs for most biological drugs,' said Udit Batra, CEO of the life science business at Merck KGaA. 'In targeting these inefficiencies we have an excellent opportunity to drastically improve rates of recovery. 'As an industry leader in chromatography, we look forward to contributing our expertise to the DiViNe consortium, helping to identify process efficiencies and supporting expanded access to affordable vaccines.' The DiViNe projects integrated purification platform will first be tested with diverse, heterogeneous vaccines, including glycoconjugates, protein antigens and viruses. Once validated with vaccines, the consortium plans to implement its purification platform in downstream processes for other biologics, including recombinant proteins, gene therapy vectors and blood products. Merck will be joined in the consortium by Affilogic (France), Aquaporin (Denmark), GenIbet Biopharmaceuticals (Portugal) and GlaxoSmithKline (Italy). The project will be co-ordinated by iBET (Portugal) and has received funding from the EUs Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme.

Facebook Google Investing Analyst Upgrades Bankruptcy Buffett Corporate Governance Corporate Performance Dividends and Buybacks Earnings ETFs and Mutual Funds International Markets IPOs and Secondaries Mergers and Acquisitions Personal Finance Rumors Value Investing Economy Energy Government Regulation Healthcare Housing Jobs Special Report Brands and Products Cities Countries States Jefferies Issues Top Pharma and Biohealth Stocks to Buy By Chris Lange September 13, 2016 10:25 am EST Print Email Tweet Despite recent market headwinds and volatility, there are strong underlying fundamentals among the large cap pharmaceuticals that are continuing to drive them forward. One key analyst issued a few of its top picks for the industry, considering the current market situation, election season and all. Jefferies now sees a more even balance between the overhang around U.S. pricing from the upcoming election and the search for yield, post-Brexit, which could benefit many companies in its universe. Ultimately the firm noted that AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV) remains its top pick globally, followed by Eli Lilly and Co. (NYSE: LLY), Novartis A.G. (NYSE: NVS), AstaZeneca PLC (NYSE: AZN) and Zoetis Inc. (NYSE: ZTS). Jefferies also explained that there could be more risk with Some of the U.S. companies that have been supported by dividend yields, such as Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), Merck & Co. (NYSE: MRK) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), which could suffer if the Federal Reserve raises rates faster and further than expected. Investors have become more engaged discussing large cap pharmaceuticals again, following a volatile end to third-quarter earnings with Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO), the CM-026 data and fresh proposals from the Clinton camp. Buy-side sentiment has cooled on Novo and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (NYSE: BMY), though there still seems room for downside to expectations for both. Jefferies gets most bullish incoming calls on AstraZeneca, Bayer and Sanofi, with the latter feeling most like a value trap near term. Sentiment on the sector has turned more negative, with a renewed focus on U.S. pricing, though most investors are not clear on exactly what proposals trouble them the most. The firm sees the European Society for Medical Oncology in early October as likely positive for Merck and negative for Bristol-Myers as comparisons at the 50% cut-off likely favor Merck. Jefferies expects Novartis to show better data for LEE011 in MONALEESA-2 compared to Ibrance, which could act as a strong driver of more positive investor sentiment for Novartis. Roche’s OAK data in 2/3L non-small cell lung cancer could act as a positive catalyst, whilst putting further pressure on Bristol-Myers as Opdivo likely faces increasing pressure in this setting. Novartis shares did not react to the surprise positive read out of BAF312 in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, likely because investors still expect the need for additional Phase 3 studies before it can be filed. However, the magnitude of the benefit seen at ECTRIMS could change this and the company is also discussing the potential for an early filing with regulators. Shares of AbbVie were trading at $64.08 on Tuesday, with a consensus analyst price target of $71.47 and a 52-week trading range of $45.45 to $68.12. Jefferies has a Buy rating for AbbVie with a $90 price target. Eli Lilly was trading at $79.08 a share. The consensus price target is $96.70, and the 52-week range is $67.88 to $92.85. Jefferies has a Buy rating and a $105 price target. Novartis shares were last seen at $80.28, within a 52-week range of $69.90 to $98.95. The consensus price target is $94.75. Shares of AstraZeneca recently traded at $33.24. The consensus price target is $35.50. The 52-week range is $26.97 to $35.04. Zoetis was changing hands at $51.15, with a consensus price target of $54.50 and a 52-week range of $38.26 to $52.64. Jefferies has a Buy rating and a $60 price target on Zoetis.

Nov 11 HIV antibody treatment shows promise, but has a ways to go Nov 11 More from Marie McCullough Arrow icon Last month, Kiran Shelat let University of Pennsylvania surgeons replace his failing kidneys with one that they knew would infect him with hepatitis C, a virus that could slowly destroy his liver. Slideshow Penn researchers: Hep C drugs make more kidneys safe for transplant Advertisment of Gallery: Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon Normally, a kidney infected with hep C would be offered only to transplant patients who already have the disease -- or it would be thrown away. But the advent of new hep C drugs, with cure rates of 95 percent or more, has led Penn transplant specialists to see infected kidneys as a small but valuable opportunity to expand the pool of organs for which 100,000 Americans are waiting. Two days after Shelat's transplant, tests confirmed that the Yardley civil engineer was hep C positive. He began a 12-week course of Zepatier, Merck's $55,000 therapy. Although it is too soon to say Shelat is cured,  the virus is now undetectable in his blood, the Penn team announced Tuesday morning. And he is free of peritoneal dialysis, the nightly 10-hour blood-cleansing process that was barely controlling the downward spiral caused by his autoimmune kidney disease. "Walking from the parking lot to my office was an ordeal," he recalled. "Only after the transplant, when I started feeling better, did I realize how bad I felt before. Now I’m walking. I’m breathing better.  I go up and down steps. It’s like being altogether a different person." David S. Goldberg, a Penn liver transplant specialist, is coleading the pilot study of 10 patients  with Penn kidney transplant specialist Peter P. Reese. Since it began in May, at least one other patient, Irma Hendricks of East Stroudsburg, Pa.,  has received a hep C-positive kidney, then eradicated her resulting infection with Zepatier. If effective, the new approach could make a dent in the kidney-transplant waiting list, where about 5 percent of patients die each year. "Last year, about 12,000 people in the U.S. got a deceased donor kidney transplant. There could be, at a minimum, maybe 1,000 more transplants if this is successful," Goldberg said.  "That's  not an insignificant number of people who get off dialysis and get their lives back." Patients who are candidates for the Penn trial go through an unusually intensive informed consent process, including an information session that family members are encouraged to attend. Shelat and his wife, Chetana, and daughter Reshma, who is a nurse, were impressed by the thoroughness and frankness of the researchers. "They said, 'Quite definitely you will get hepatitis C,' " Shelat recalled. "I thought, 'What if I do this, and take a chance, and get into some serious trouble later on?' But as I listened more, and they showed me Zepatier’s [cure] numbers, I saw they were confident. It allowed me to relax."  Although Penn was the trailblazer, Johns Hopkins University last month launched a similar clinical trial. The first of 10 patients has received a transplant, been treated with Zepatier, and now has no detectable virus, said Niraj Desai, director of Hopkins' kidney transplant program. "We were throwing these kidneys away," Desai said. "Organs from young donors.  We’re throwing them away while wait-list patients are dying." Merck is donating its drug for the trials, but costs are a major concern. Gilead Sciences' hep C drug, Harvoni,  costs about $94,000 for a treatment course.  That's in addition to the cost of a transplant and medications to prevent organ rejection. "But a year of dialysis is close to $75,000," Goldberg said. "If people survive three years, studies show a kidney transplant is cost effective." Kidney recipients also have one of the highest transplant-survival rates, averaging 15 years, he said. Besides making use of otherwise wasted organs, transplanting hep C-positive kidneys could help mitigate the horror of the growing opioid epidemic, Goldberg and Reese believe. Many people who become addicted to opioid painkillers go on to inject heroin in order to prevent agonizing withdrawal symptoms. Many wind up with hep C because it is easily transmitted among injectors who share syringes. "It’s a tragedy, obviously, but there has been a huge increase in donors who die of a drug overdose [and are hep C positive]," Goldberg said. "One bit of solace for the family may be that the kidneys could be used." Shelat, for one, is eager to become a champion of the approach. "When I feel better, I would love to take part in this effort and spread the word," he said. "If a patient has even the smallest doubt, here I am, the proof. I’m grateful. I’m blessed."

for old. Old for young." (PRNewsFoto/Merck)     Facebook Twitter Pinterest Merck Logo (PRNewsFoto/Merck)     Facebook Twitter Pinterest × The WE100 movement's motto is "Young for old. Old for young." (PRNewsFoto/Merck) Merck Logo (PRNewsFoto/Merck) DARMSTADT, Germany, September 13, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- "WE100" movement will promote activities to prepare society for 100 healthy years across generations  Merck, a leading science and technology company, revealed the new purpose "Prepare society for a new era of humans living 100 healthy years" for its Consumer Health business. The purpose will be brought to life through the movement "WE100®" aimed at raising awareness of healthy living, all the way from children's age to 100 years. The WE100 movement with its motto "Young for old. Old for young." will also coordinate concrete actions to help prepare society for humans living 100 healthy years.      (Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160913/406890 ) The new purpose of the Consumer Health business of Merck has been presented along with the WE100 movement by Uta Kemmerich-Keil, President and CEO of the Consumer Health Business, who commented "Our main objective is to change perceptions of society and take concrete action to articulate the next steps on our journey toward 100 healthy years. This initiative is equally aimed at the younger population, which needs to be educated now about the right approach to healthy ageing." Kemmerich-Keil added "We decided to launch a new purpose and WE100 as a neutral movement so that everybody sharing the goal of preparing society to live 100 healthy years could join," Kemmerich-Keil concluded. The WE100 movement was also recently presented at Cannes Creativity Festival by Atilla Cansun, Chief Marketing Officer of the Consumer Health business of Merck, who explained "We believe age does not influence how much one has to offer. Our first step will be to eliminate the barriers preventing the older generation to be fully involved and integrated in society. We want to set the bar high and we welcome anyone sharing our goal to prepare society for humans living 100 healthy years to join us as the WE100 movement develops." As life expectancy continues to increase dramatically across the world since 1945, surveys show that society is not yet prepared for the prospect of humans living 100 years.[1] According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the world's population over 60 years will nearly double from 12% to 22% by 2050. As a first step of the WE100 movement, the Consumer Health business of Merck conducted a survey on ageing and the perception of ageing across society, which showed that 80% of interviewees think that society needs to dramatically change its perception and attitude towards ageing. The survey also showed that 95% of interviewees believe governments are not taking a proactive role in findings solutions to trigger greater involvement in the society after retirement. In addition, 80% of those interviewed think they have lower chances to find jobs at age 50+ versus younger generations. Finally, when asked whether children are prepared to live 100 healthy years, 93% of survey respondents say current education is falling short of providing the necessary information to prepare children early on to live a long healthy life. As part of the WE100 movement pilots, activities in schools are planned in 2017 to help children prepare for healthy ageing. Finally, as of October 2016, WE100 will start working on establishing partnerships with public and private organizations around the theme of living 100 healthy years to involve relevant stakeholders in the movement.

The purpose will be brought to life through the movement "WE100®" aimed at raising awareness of healthy living, all the way from children's age to 100 years. The WE100 movement with its motto "Young for old. Old for young." will also coordinate concrete actions to help prepare society for humans living 100 healthy years. (Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160913/406890 ) The new purpose of the Consumer Health business of Merck has been presented along with the WE100 movement by Uta Kemmerich-Keil, President and CEO of the Consumer Health Business, who commented "Our main objective is to change perceptions of society and take concrete action to articulate the next steps on our journey toward 100 healthy years. This initiative is equally aimed at the younger population, which needs to be educated now about the right approach to healthy ageing." Kemmerich-Keil added "We decided to launch a new purpose and WE100 as a neutral movement so that everybody sharing the goal of preparing society to live 100 healthy years could join," Kemmerich-Keil concluded. The WE100 movement was also recently presented at Cannes Creativity Festival by Atilla Cansun, Chief Marketing Officer of the Consumer Health business of Merck, who explained "We believe age does not influence how much one has to offer. Our first step will be to eliminate the barriers preventing the older generation to be fully involved and integrated in society. We want to set the bar high and we welcome anyone sharing our goal to prepare society for humans living 100 healthy years to join us as the WE100 movement develops." As life expectancy continues to increase dramatically across the world since 1945, surveys show that society is not yet prepared for the prospect of humans living 100 years.[1] According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the world's population over 60 years will nearly double from 12% to 22% by 2050. As a first step of the WE100 movement, the Consumer Health business of Merck conducted a survey on ageing and the perception of ageing across society, which showed that 80% of interviewees think that society needs to dramatically change its perception and attitude towards ageing. The survey also showed that 95% of interviewees believe governments are not taking a proactive role in findings solutions to trigger greater involvement in the society after retirement. In addition, 80% of those interviewed think they have lower chances to find jobs at age 50+ versus younger generations. Finally, when asked whether children are prepared to live 100 healthy years, 93% of survey respondents say current education is falling short of providing the necessary information to prepare children early on to live a long healthy life. As part of the WE100 movement pilots, activities in schools are planned in 2017 to help children prepare for healthy ageing. Finally, as of October 2016, WE100 will start working on establishing partnerships with public and private organizations around the theme of living 100 healthy years to involve relevant stakeholders in the movement.

"Merck is committed to advancing patient care and offering therapeutic options that help address unmet medical needs for people with MS, with a focus on efficacy, dosing, durability and safety," said Luciano Rossetti, Global Head of Research & Development for Merck's biopharma business. "We look forward to sharing additional data on Rebif® and Cladribine Tablets with the scientific community at this year's ECTRIMS Congress." Oral presentations include a comparison of the CLARITY and the CLARITY EXTENSION studies, which sought to examine the duration of clinical outcome response to Cladribine Tablets, and results of the SOLAR study, which examined the effects of adding high-dose cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) to Rebif® therapy for patients with RRMS. Poster presentations will report on clinical and magnetic resonance imaging outcomes in patients treated with Cladribine Tablets or Rebif® and patient-reported outcomes in patients being treated with Rebif®. Several health economics outcomes research presentations will highlight key issues facing people with MS, including pregnancy outcomes. In addition to data presentations, a Merck-sponsored satellite symposium, "Reimagining the MS Treatment Journey," will take place Wednesday, September 14, 18:45-19:45 BST in Hall A at the ExCel. The panel session will feature distinguished experts in MS who will debate whether unmet needs in MS care remain, consider what an ideal MS therapy might look like, and review current and potential future therapies. On Thursday, September 15, Merck will hold its fourth annual Grant for Multiple Sclerosis Innovations (GMSI) Awards symposium. Up to €1 million will be awarded to one or more researchers to support work that aims to improve the understanding of MS for the ultimate benefit of patients. The symposium will take place in the South Gallery 19 at the ExCel from 19:30-20:30 BST. For more information about the data to be presented, please review the ECTRIMS website. Also, visit Merck's booth at this year's Congress to learn more about the company's programs and commitment to advancing MS care. About Cladribine Tablets Cladribine Tablets is an oral small molecule prodrug that selectively and periodically targets lymphocytes thought to be integral to the pathological process of MS. Cladribine Tablets is currently under clinical investigation and not approved for any use in the United States, Canada and Europe. About Rebif® Rebif® (interferon beta-1a) is a disease-modifying drug used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) and is similar to the interferon beta protein produced by the human body. The efficacy of Rebif® in chronic progressive MS has not been established. Interferon ß is thought to help reduce inflammation. The exact mechanism is unknown. Rebif®, which was approved in Europe in 1998 and in the US in 2002, is registered in more than 90 countries worldwide. Rebif® has been proven to delay the progression of disability, reduce the frequency of relapses and reduce MRI lesion activity and area*. Rebif® can be administrated with the RebiSmart® electronic auto-injection device (not approved in the US), or with the RebiDose® single-use disposable pen, or the manual multidose injection pen RebiSlide™. Rebif® can also be administered with the autoinjector Rebiject II® or by manual injection using ready-to-use pre-filled syringes. These injection devices are not approved in all countries. In January 2012, the European commission approved the extension of the indication of Rebif® in early multiple sclerosis. The extension of the indication of Rebif® has not been submitted in the United States. Rebif® should be used with caution in patients with a history of depression, liver disease, thyroid abnormalities and seizures. Most commonly reported side effects are flu-like symptoms, injection site disorders, elevation of liver enzymes and blood cell abnormalities. Patients, especially those with depression, seizure disorders, or liver problems, should discuss treatment with Rebif® with their doctors. *The exact correlation between MRI findings and the current or future clinical status of patients, including disability progression, is unknown. Rebif® (interferon beta-1a) is approved in the United States for relapsing forms of MS. RebiSmart®, an electronic device for self-injection of Rebif®, is also not approved in the United States. Cladribine Tablets is an investigational product and not approved for use in any indication in the United States. About Multiple Sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory condition of the central nervous system and is the most common, non-traumatic, disabling neurological disease in young adults. It is estimated that approximately 2.3 million people have MS worldwide. While symptoms can vary, the most common symptoms of MS include blurred vision, numbness or tingling in the limbs and problems with strength and coordination. The relapsing forms of MS are the most common. All Merck Press Releases are distributed by e-mail at the same time they become available on the Merck Website.

The rest of the market is, however, fragmented and is characterized by the presence of several large and small players. Transparency Market Research notes that the rivalry within the animal healthcare industry is quite high due to the existence of a large number of players and this trend is also reflected in the global poultry pharmaceutical market. “The high degree of competition ensures that poultry pharmaceutical companies maintain regular interaction and collaborations with drug retailers, governments, and poultry farmers,” the author of the study states. The revenue generated by the global poultry pharmaceuticals market was pegged at US$3.7 bn in 2015 and is projected to reach US$7.8 bn by 2024, registering a healthy CAGR of 8.5% during the forecast period. Interpret a Competitive outlook Analysis Report with free PDF Brochure: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_id=11486 Product innovation has also proven to be a successful strategy adopted by players in the poultry pharmaceutical market, TMR finds. For instance, in September 2015, Merial Animal Health globally launched its innovation in poultry vaccination technology, known as Merial Avinew. This move has strengthened Merial’s position in the market. North America and Latin America Emerge as Most Promising Markets for Poultry Pharmaceuticals  By type of product, vaccines held the leading share in the global poultry pharmaceuticals market in terms of revenue, accounting for just over 41% in 2016. Feed additive medications, on the other hand, will register an 8.8% CAGR during the forecast period, emerging as a highly lucrative product segment. Based on type of animal, chicken is the key contributor to the overall market and is likely to remain so through 2024. The segment will also register a higher growth rate than any other category. Geographically, while North America dominates the global poultry pharmaceutical market, accounting for just short of 36% in 2016, Latin America is forecast to clock in the highest CAGR of 9.2% from 2016 to 2024. View exclusive Global Strategic Business report: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/poultry-pharmaceuticals-market.html Rising Poultry Franchises in Emerging Nations a Key Growth Driver  The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in the U.S states that the demand for food is expected to double due to the increase in global population, which is projected to be around 9.1 billion by 2050. In order to cater to this ever-rising demand for food, the number of poultry farming operations and franchises has increased significantly in recent years. China, Brazil, Mexico, India, Russia, and Argentina are among the leading countries with a high growth rate in terms of poultry animal ownership. This has benefited the poultry pharmaceutical market. Apart from this, the poultry pharmaceuticals market is fueled by the growing emphasis on wellness and preventive care by veterinarians and poultry animal owners, the rising consumption of animal protein, the increasing incidence of poultry diseases, and the support from government and private organizations in the form of vaccination initiatives. In contrast, the poultry pharmaceutical market is hampered by stringent regulations, lengthy product approval periods, and limited vaccination production. The growing concerns regarding the use of antibiotics and growth promoters in animal feed are also hindering the growth of the global market. This review is based on the findings of a TMR report titled “Poultry Pharmaceuticals Market – (By Product – Drugs, Vaccines, Feed Additive, and Medication; By Animal Type – Chicken, Turkey, Duck, Goose, and Others) – Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecast 2016 – 2024.” Browse Global Industry PR:  http://www.europlat.org/poultry-pharmaceuticals-market.htm Global Poultry Pharmaceuticals Market, by Product Type  – Drugs – VETRIMOXIN – Other Drug Products – Vaccines – INNOVAX – NOBILIS – Poulvac – Other Vaccine Products – Feed Additive Medication – VIGOSINE – Amnovit – Other Feed Additive Medication Global Poultry Pharmaceuticals Market, by Animal Type  – Chicken – Turkey – Duck – Goose – Others Global Poultry Pharmaceuticals Market, by Geography  – North America – U.S. – Canada – Europe – U.K. – Germany – Rest of Europe – Asia Pacific – China – India – Rest of Asia Pacific – Latin America – Brazil – Rest of Latin America – Middle East & Africa – South Africa – Rest of Middle East & Africa Browse Other Latest Research Reports:   – Companion Animal Vaccines Market: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/companion-animal-vaccines-market.html – Small Animal Imaging Market: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/small-animal-imaging.html – U.S. Pet Medication Market: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/us-pet-medication-market.html About Us:  Transparency Market Research (TMR) is a U.S. based provider of syndicated research, customized research, and consulting services.

The rest of the market is, however, fragmented and is characterized by the presence of several large and small players. Transparency Market Research notes that the rivalry within the animal healthcare industry is quite high due to the existence of a large number of players and this trend is also reflected in the global poultry pharmaceutical market. "The high degree of competition ensures that poultry pharmaceutical companies maintain regular interaction and collaborations with drug retailers, governments, and poultry farmers," the author of the study states. The revenue generated by the global poultry pharmaceuticals market was pegged at US$3.7 bn in 2015 and is projected to reach US$7.8 bn by 2024, registering a healthy CAGR of 8.5% during the forecast period. Interpret a Competitive outlook Analysis Report with free PDF Brochure: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_id=11486 Product innovation has also proven to be a successful strategy adopted by players in the poultry pharmaceutical market, TMR finds. For instance, in September 2015, Merial Animal Health globally launched its innovation in poultry vaccination technology, known as Merial Avinew. This move has strengthened Merial's position in the market. North America and Latin America Emerge as Most Promising Markets for Poultry Pharmaceuticals  By type of product, vaccines held the leading share in the global poultry pharmaceuticals market in terms of revenue, accounting for just over 41% in 2016. Feed additive medications, on the other hand, will register an 8.8% CAGR during the forecast period, emerging as a highly lucrative product segment. Based on type of animal, chicken is the key contributor to the overall market and is likely to remain so through 2024. The segment will also register a higher growth rate than any other category. Geographically, while North America dominates the global poultry pharmaceutical market, accounting for just short of 36% in 2016, Latin America is forecast to clock in the highest CAGR of 9.2% from 2016 to 2024. View exclusive Global Strategic Business report: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/poultry-pharmaceuticals-market.html Rising Poultry Franchises in Emerging Nations a Key Growth Driver  The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in the U.S states that the demand for food is expected to double due to the increase in global population, which is projected to be around 9.1 billion by 2050. In order to cater to this ever-rising demand for food, the number of poultry farming operations and franchises has increased significantly in recent years. China, Brazil, Mexico, India, Russia, and Argentina are among the leading countries with a high growth rate in terms of poultry animal ownership. This has benefited the poultry pharmaceutical market. Apart from this, the poultry pharmaceuticals market is fueled by the growing emphasis on wellness and preventive care by veterinarians and poultry animal owners, the rising consumption of animal protein, the increasing incidence of poultry diseases, and the support from government and private organizations in the form of vaccination initiatives. In contrast, the poultry pharmaceutical market is hampered by stringent regulations, lengthy product approval periods, and limited vaccination production. The growing concerns regarding the use of antibiotics and growth promoters in animal feed are also hindering the growth of the global market. This review is based on the findings of a TMR report titled "Poultry Pharmaceuticals Market - (By Product - Drugs, Vaccines, Feed Additive, and Medication; By Animal Type - Chicken, Turkey, Duck, Goose, and Others) - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecast 2016 - 2024."

(COTI) September 13, 2016 08:30 ET Critical Outcome Appoints Dr. Bharatt Chowrira to Its Board of Directors Seasoned Biopharmaceutical Executive Brings Unique Blend of Life Science, Legal, Business and Operational Expertise to the Board LONDON, ON--(Marketwired - September 13, 2016) - Critical Outcome Technologies Inc. (TSX VENTURE: COT) (OTCQB: COTQF) ("COTI" or the "Company") a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company advancing innovative and targeted therapies for the treatment of cancer, announced today that it has appointed Dr. Bharatt Chowrira to its Board of Directors. Dr. Chowrira has more than 20 years of industry experience that spans progressively senior management positions serving on and working with the boards of private and public companies. "We are pleased to welcome such an accomplished biopharmaceutical executive to our Board," said Mr. John Drake, Chairman of the Board. "During his career, Bharatt has been instrumental in several licensing and collaboration partnerships, and in raising significant amounts of equity for private and public companies. He is well-versed in pipeline development, portfolio evaluation and prioritization, and intellectual property law matters. We look forward to leveraging his expertise at the Board level." Dr. Chowrira is currently the President of Synlogic Inc, a U.S. biopharmaceutical company focused on synthetic biotics, where he has overseen and managed corporate and business development, alliance management, and financial and legal operations since September 2015. Prior to joining Synlogic, Dr. Chowrira was the Chief Operating Officer of Auspex Pharmaceuticals, which was acquired by Teva Pharmaceuticals in the spring of 2015. Previously, he was President and Chief Executive Officer of Addex Therapeutics, a biotechnology company publicly-traded on the SIX Swiss Exchange. Before that, he held various leadership and management positions at Nektar Therapeutics, Merck & Co., Sirna Therapeutics, (acquired by Merck & Co.) and Ribozyme Pharmaceuticals. Dr. Chowrira has a J.D. from the University of Denver's Sturm College of Law, a Ph.D. in Molecular Biology from the University of Vermont College of Medicine, a M.S. in Molecular Biology from Illinois State University, and a B.S. in Microbiology from the University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore, India. "I am thrilled to be joining the COTI Board. I have been very impressed with the Company's innovative approach to addressing difficult to treat gynecological cancers," said Dr. Chowrira. "Selective targeting of the mutant forms of p53 protein, a central switch in a number of cancers, has been the focus of intense research in the field for a number of years with limited success. COTI scientists may potentially have solved this puzzle and are currently evaluating their lead oral small molecule candidate in women with gynecological cancers. If this compound is able to achieve efficacy in these patients, in my opinion this would be a major advance in this field. I am looking forward to working with the rest of the Board and management team at COTI to help grow the business as they continue to make significant progress." About Critical Outcome Technologies Inc. COTI is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company advancing the treatment of cancer through targeted therapeutics. The Company's lead compound, COTI-2, has a novel p53-dependent mechanism of action with selective and potent anti-cancer activity. The initial therapeutic indication is in gynecologic cancers, which includes ovarian, cervical, and endometrial cancers; treatment of patients in a Phase 1 clinical trial began at MD Anderson Cancer Center in February 2016. The Company has secured orphan drug status for the ovarian indication in the U.S. and is planning additional studies in other cancer indications such as head and neck, Li-Fraumeni Syndrome, and acute myelogenous leukemia, based upon more than ten animal xenograft models showing both single and combination agent activity of COTI-2 with other leading cancer drugs. Preclinical data provides evidence to suggest a potentially dramatic change in the treatment of cancers with mutations of the p53 gene.

Merck's Consumer Health Business Presents New Purpose to Help Prepare Society for 100 Healthy Years Merck's Consumer Health Business Presents New Purpose to Help Prepare Society for 100 Healthy Years CHIMICA E FARMACIA Tweet Condividi su WhatsApp Pubblicato il: 13/09/2016 09:16 DARMSTADT, Germany, September 13, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Merck, a leading science and technology company, revealed the new purpose "Prepare society for a new era of humans living 100 healthy years" for its Consumer Health business. The purpose will be brought to life through the movement "WE100®" aimed at raising awareness of healthy living, all the way from children's age to 100 years. The WE100 movement with its motto "Young for old. Old for young." will also coordinate concrete actions to help prepare society for humans living 100 healthy years.      (Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160913/406890 ) The new purpose of the Consumer Health business of Merck has been presented along with the WE100 movement by Uta Kemmerich-Keil, President and CEO of the Consumer Health Business, who commented "Our main objective is to change perceptions of society and take concrete action to articulate the next steps on our journey toward 100 healthy years. This initiative is equally aimed at the younger population, which needs to be educated now about the right approach to healthy ageing." Kemmerich-Keil added "We decided to launch a new purpose and WE100 as a neutral movement so that everybody sharing the goal of preparing society to live 100 healthy years could join," Kemmerich-Keil concluded. The WE100 movement was also recently presented at Cannes Creativity Festival by Atilla Cansun, Chief Marketing Officer of the Consumer Health business of Merck, who explained "We believe age does not influence how much one has to offer. Our first step will be to eliminate the barriers preventing the older generation to be fully involved and integrated in society. We want to set the bar high and we welcome anyone sharing our goal to prepare society for humans living 100 healthy years to join us as the WE100 movement develops." As life expectancy continues to increase dramatically across the world since 1945, surveys show that society is not yet prepared for the prospect of humans living 100 years.[1] According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the world's population over 60 years will nearly double from 12% to 22% by 2050. As a first step of the WE100 movement, the Consumer Health business of Merck conducted a survey on ageing and the perception of ageing across society, which showed that 80% of interviewees think that society needs to dramatically change its perception and attitude towards ageing. The survey also showed that 95% of interviewees believe governments are not taking a proactive role in findings solutions to trigger greater involvement in the society after retirement. In addition, 80% of those interviewed think they have lower chances to find jobs at age 50+ versus younger generations. Finally, when asked whether children are prepared to live 100 healthy years, 93% of survey respondents say current education is falling short of providing the necessary information to prepare children early on to live a long healthy life. As part of the WE100 movement pilots, activities in schools are planned in 2017 to help children prepare for healthy ageing. Finally, as of October 2016, WE100 will start working on establishing partnerships with public and private organizations around the theme of living 100 healthy years to involve relevant stakeholders in the movement.

CEO Of EpiPen Maker Mylan To Face Congressional Hearing Next Week Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share CEO Of EpiPen Maker Mylan To Face Congressional Hearing Next Week Image courtesy of M September 14, 2016 12:31 pm EST By Chris Morran@themorrancave a little oversight epipen Mylan heather bresch drugs teva In recent weeks, members of both the House and Senate have raised questions about the soaring price of — and potential antitrust concerns surrounding — emergency allergy treatment EpiPen. A congressional committee confirmed this morning that it will soon hold a hearing on the issue, and that Heather Bresch, CEO of EpiPen maker Mylan, has been called to testify. The House Oversight Committee will hold the hearing — titled “Reviewing the Rising Price of EpiPens” — on Wed. Sept. 21 at 10 a.m. ET. Bresch — whose father is Joe Manchin, current U.S. Senator from West Virginia and former governor of that state — is expected to be joined by Dr. Doug Throckmorton, the FDA’s Deputy Director at the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. Mylan has come under fire for raising the price on EpiPen — a critical emergency treatment for anaphylaxis — by as much as 600% since acquiring the drug when it purchased Merck’s generics division nearly a decade ago. “There is justified outrage from families and schools across the country struggling to afford the high cost of EpiPens,” reads a joint statement from committee Ranking Member Rep. Elijah Cummings (GA) and committee Chair Rep. Jason Chaffetz (UT). “We look forward to receiving answers next week from Mylan about its dramatic price hike for this life-saving medication.” The price issue wouldn’t be so contentious is there was sufficient competition in the marketplace. Reps. Chaffetz and Cummings say the committee will “examine ways to encourage greater competition in the EpiPen market and to speed FDA’s approval of acceptable new generic applications.” One lower-price competitor, AdrenaClick, is not as widely available and some pharmacies that do stock the product charge around the same price as they do for EpiPen. Mylan has announced plans for a generic version of EpiPen, but the sticker price on a two-pack of the drug would still be $300. Teva Pharmaceuticals has been working on a competing product, but the FDA rejected this application in February for “major deficiencies.” However, Teva recently stated that it hopes to address those concerns and get its EpiPen alternative on the market by 2018. Some emergency medical technicians have taken to creating their own Epi-Kits that provide them with everything they need to treat a patient in an emergency — at a cost of only around $20 each. Lawmakers have also raised potential antitrust concerns regarding the EpiPen4Schools program, which provides participating schools with some of the epinephrine injectors at a discount price, but which also appears to prohibit these schools from purchasing any products that compete with EpiPen. The New York attorney general’s office has already confirmed that it is investigating this issue. Meanwhile members of congress and consumer advocates — including our colleagues at Consumers Union — have called for a federal antitrust investigation.

Listeria monocytogenes is a bacterial pathogen capable of causing severe infections in humans, often with fatal outcomes. According to USFDA, published studies suggest that 1- 8% of humans may be intestinal carriers of Listeria. According to Unites States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Listeria causes about 280 cases of illness in newborns in a typical year, resulting in 60 deaths and stillbirths. Infants can be infected before birth, and this infection can cause serious disability in newborns. About 35 infants are disabled as a result of infection from Listeria each year. The key factors assisting the growth of Listeria monocytogenes infections treatment market are rise in prevalence of foodborne diseases, stringent laws and policies issued by FDA, rising demand for healthy and microbial-free food, and high public awareness related to foodborne diseases in developed countries.

A 75 percent higher proportion of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients reached "no evidence of disease activity" status with Ocrevus in a head-to-head trial against Merck's Rebif, Roche said in a statement. Additionally, doctors found no evidence of disease progression in a 47 percent higher proportion of primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) patients compared with a placebo. There are no approved treatments for PPMS. More on this... How one neurologist diagnosed with multiple sclerosis is using his experience to treat MS patients Using chemo to treat MS shows 'remarkable' promise Social networking site connects multiple sclerosis patients Earlier this year, Roche accelerated its timeline for Ocrevus approval, saying it could come in 2016 after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave it fast-track review status. Analysts estimate Ocrevus, whose generic name is ocrelizumab, could generate annual sales of nearly 4 billion Swiss francs ($4.09 billion) by 2022, according to Thomson Reuters data. "These new data suggest that ocrelizumab consistently impacts disease progression and has the potential to change how we approach treating both relapsing and primary progressive MS," Gavin Giovannoni, who heads up neurology at The London School of Medicine and Dentistry and is on the committee leading the Roche study, said in the statement. Ocrevus is among several new drugs that Roche hopes can offset patent expiries among older medicines that will leave it more vulnerable to competition from cheaper generic or biosimilar medicines.

Proposition 61, the Drug Price Relief Act, is the Los Angeles-based AIDS Healthcare Foundation’s response to a controversy over the dramatic price increase of some prescription drugs—most notably EpiPen, a lifesaving anti-allergic reaction device. For Deia Davis-Williams of Beaumont, a 400 percent increase in the price of EpiPen threatens her life. Davis-Williams says she has used EpiPen for 14 years to combat a fatal allergy to latex and never received notice of a price change from her healthcare provider. She now pays $400 for an injector she’d routinely buy with a co-pay of $20, since her health insurances no longer covers EpiPen. “I had a refill that I needed due to an attack in May and my pens were defective, the needle broke on one and the other pen did not work as well, so I had no pens at all,” Davis-Williams said. “I had to go for a refill and that’s when I found out it wasn’t covered with my insurance anymore, and I was going to have to pay full price and I didn’t have the money.” EpiPen users won’t be the only group affected by the price increase. Last January, a bill took effect requiring all California schools to stock at least one injector. Taxpayers will have to foot the bill. California’s Prop. 61 promises to deal directly with lowering prescription drug prices. It would prohibit state programs such as Medicaid from paying more for a drug than the lowest price paid by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, which typically receives discounts. It is reported the pharmaceutical industry has spent nearly $70 million to defeat the initiative. Mylan, the generics and specialty pharmaceutical company, is responsible for raising prices on the product they acquired in 2007 from pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck. Back then, the price for a pack of two EpiPens was $100. Now it costs nearly $600. Last week, Mylan announced the expansion of existing cost-cutting programs to patients for out-of-pocket costs and issued savings cards, but coupons may not be enough to satisfy users and lawmakers. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Connecticut) said this step by the pharmaceutical giant seems more like a public relations drill than an actual remedy. “What’s needed is robust, real action to lower the price for everyone, not just a select few,” said Blumenthal. Mylan Chief Executive Officer Heather Bresch, who also oversees the lobbying group Generic Pharmaceutical Association, said the price increase was necessary for the company to recoup its investment in EpiPen. According to the company, this includes raising awareness for severe allergic reactions and making improvements to how the product works. But critics argue the price increase isn’t driven by Mylan’s costs. Just $1 worth of epinephrine, the active ingredient, is used in the injector and manufacturing costs are pennies per device. Director of the Center for Healthcare Research and Transformation at the University of Michigan, Marianne Udow-Phillips, said Mylan knew they had a monopoly on the product. “Congress does need to do something to change this picture,” said Udow-Phillips.”This is a perfect demonstration of the complexity and real problems with pharmaceutical pricing in this country.” Bresch’s father, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-West Virginia), weighed in on the onslaught of criticism over EpiPen price increase. “I am aware of the questions my colleagues and many parents are asking, and frankly, I share their concerns about the skyrocketing prices of prescription drugs,” he said. “I look forward to reviewing their response in detail and working with my colleagues, and all interested parties to lower the price of prescription drugs and to continue to improve our healthcare system.” Bresch vigorously defended the price hikes, arguing the U.S. healthcare framework incentivizes higher prices through a complex thicket of drug companies, insurers, healthcare providers and pharmacy benefit managers. “There’s no question, the system is broken,” she said. “There’s no transparency, there’s no clarity and no one knows what anything costs.” Prescription drug prices have become a huge concern for the public, with a growing awareness that prescription drug costs are often significantly lower in countries such as Canada. Davis-Williams said she considers moving out of the country in order to afford the lifesaving device. “I don’t want to die and leave my kids without a mother all because I can’t get a medication to keep me from dying because someone has decided that my life is not worth saving or anyone else’s,” she said. Pfizer Canada is the sole distributor of EpiPens through a licensing agreement with Mylan. Prices for the device have remained the same for the past few years. Patients can obtain two EpiPens for $210 without a prescription. Mylan says in the U.S. they receive $274 on the sale of two EpiPens, claiming the other $400 goes to U.S. insurers and wholesalers. After much scrutiny, this week Mylan announced they would introduce a generic EpiPen identical to the existing product with a wholesale list price of $300. “We understand the deep frustration and concerns associated with the cost of EpiPen to the patient, and have always shared the public’s desire to ensure that this important product be accessible to anyone who needs it,” Bresch said, in a statement. “Our decision to launch a generic alternative to EpiPen is an extraordinary commercial response, which required the cooperation of our partner.” But Davis-Williams doesn’t believe the generic substitute will contain the same potency as the original EpiPen. “Any medication that you decide you’re going to make a generic version of, you don’t know if you’re getting the full strength or not,” Davis-Williams said. “Like Claritin, when they made a store brand available, it was not as strong as it was and my kids are on it. I ended up having to get a doctor’s prescription for the medication because the one being sold over the counter wasn’t helping my kids’ allergies at all.” _____ By Madlen Grgodjaian California Black Media Follow Filed Under: featured, Health Tagged With: CBM, Epipen Connect With Us!

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Dale Wyngarden: Big pharma controls Congress Tuesday Sep 13, 2016 at 2:01 AM By Dale WyngardenCommunity Columnist The EpiPen story is familiar to anyone who reads by now. An automated injector for a dose of epinephrin (adrenaline) to counteract anaphylactic shock, usually triggered by severe allergic reactions, was developed in the 1970s, and licensed for sale by the FDA in 1987. For two decades, it produced a steady stream of revenue for several pharmaceutical companies licensed to market it.  When Mylan Pharmaceutical bought distribution rights from Merck in 2007, it generated $200 million in sales. The same year, the Mylan CEO received compensation of $2.4 million and Mylan stock traded at $13.29 a share. Nine years later, sales topped $1 billion, CEO compensation skyrocketed to $18.9 million and stock values reached $47.59. This prosperity was fueled by a steady stream of price escalation that quintupled the wholesale price and drove the retail price from less than $100 to nearly $600. All of this on the backs of families desperate to protect the vulnerable from deadly allergic reactions, and on the backs of taxpayers cursed with a federal government that is complicit.  It's just business. Free enterprise, claims Mylan. Free enterprise, my posterior. We know what free enterprise looks like in Holland. Look at the office furniture industry. Four world leaders in our backyard. All of them seemingly prosperous. All competing with each other. Mylan enjoys a virtual monopoly, thanks to our federal Food and Drug Administration and patent protection, and you and I pay dearly for it.  Europe counts as many as nine different products delivering epinephrin, but our FDA keeps foreign drugs out of our market, supposedly to protect the quality and integrity of American made pharmaceuticals, This, despite the fact that on any global ranking of health care system we always come in as the most expensive and somewhere between the 24th and 36th most effective. We're consistently behind almost every European country.  EpiPens in Europe sell in a range from $75 to $100. National health care systems sit at table with pharmaceutical suppliers that enjoy a virtual monopoly and negotiate a price that is fair to both manufacturers and taxpayers. We, on the other hand, not only don't, but our Congress, ever appreciative of the cash cow the pharmaceutical industry has been to our political process, has even enacted a law prohibiting our largest medical insurance program, Medicare, from negotiating prices. While protecting Mylan's monopoly, our government responds to obscene price escalation by simply paying. At our expense, of course.  This doesn't come without some cost to the industry. In 2008, Mylan's lobbying expenses climbed from $270,000 to $1.2 million. Last year Pfizer reportedly spent over $10 million on lobbying. Tracking lobbying spending over the past 18 years, the Center for Responsive Politics finds the pharmaceutical and health products industries top all others at nearly $3.4 billion. There have got to be a lot of lobster thermador lunches and luxury golf outings buried in that pile. And can contributions to politicians be far behind? So far, presidential candidates have raked in nearly $9.5 million from the pharmaceutical industry. Ideology seems to make scant difference. Money flows to all candidates, on both sides of the aisle. Mylan's abject greed and wanton disregard for the American people, whose government has protected them with a virtual monopoly, grieves me. So also does the perception that the loyalties of our Congress and federal agencies have been bought by the sea of dollars from the pharmaceutical industry rather than the votes of hometown constituents. Washington seems broken, and nobody we send there seems much interested in fixing it. We may get a congressional hearing, but don't hope for much more. — Dale Wyngarden is a resident of the city of Holland. He can be reached at wyngarden@ameritech.net.

The research study covers the present scenario and growth prospects of the global musculoskeletal disorders therapeutics marketfor 2016-2020. To calculate the market size, the report considers revenue generated from the sales of branded, generic, and off-label drugs used to treat musculoskeletal disorders including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and fibromyalgia. The report also considers the revenues to be generated from the sales of drugs that are expected to be launched into the market along with the decline in revenues from the patent expiries of the marketed drugs during the forecast period. Request a sample report: http://www.technavio.com/request-a-sample?report=52671 Technavio's sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. Technavio healthcare and life sciences analysts highlight the following four factors that are contributing to the growth of the global musculoskeletal disorders therapeutics market: High growth potential of mAbs Unmet needs of therapeutics Tentative approval of advanced drugs Technological advancements in medical imaging Ask an analyst: http://www.technavio.com/content/ask-analyst?report=52671 Ask Technavio's lead analysts a question about this market and they will have your answer within 24 hours. High growth potential of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) The understanding of a disease at the molecular level increases the development and use of biologics in treating it. Biologics have a high affinity toward specific disease cells. They account for over 18% of the global pharmaceutical sales, outpacing the sales of branded pharmaceuticals. These drugs will continue to out-perform pharmaceuticals in terms of product sales, as there is an increasing need for effective treatment options. Biologics that treat musculoskeletal disorders are made from proteins. They work by blocking the action of key chemicals or cells involved in the inflammation of joints. A few mAbs used to treat musculoskeletal disorders include adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab, and infliximab. "Apart from the approved mAbs, there are other mAbs in various stages of the pipeline, for the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders," says Barath Palada, a lead analyst at Technavio for cardiovascular and metabolic disorders research. Unmet needs of therapeutics The growing unmet medical needs in the global musculoskeletal disorder market is a major factor driving the market. For instance, psoriatic arthritis has an elusive etiology, making it difficult for drug makers to develop and manufacture a targeted therapy for it. There is, as yet, no cure for the condition, and treatment depends on the symptoms of the disease. Similarly, tolerability and the method of drug administration are important factors influencing compliance with the treatment plan. Many effective pharmacologic options are available to prevent and treat osteoporosis. However, a few can slow down the rate of bone resorption or reverse the long-term loss of bone mass. These unmet medical needs, in terms of safety, efficacy, and compliance, have inspired researchers to develop drugs that increase bone density, replace lost bone, and rebuild bone strength. To gain a competitive advantage, market players should develop cost-competitive drugs with ease of administration that promote bone building effectively. For instance, Pfizer is expected to lead the market because of the launch of bazedoxifene (third-generation SERM) in late 2013. The company obtained the US FDA's approval for bazedoxifene as part of the combination drug Duavee in the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Moreover, biologic drugs have serious adverse effects. Therefore, many patients opt out of the treatment regimen. All these factors further extend the unmet medical needs of the market, presenting vendors with an opportunity to develop therapies that have better efficacy and safety profiles than currently available drugs. Tentative approval of advanced drugs Despite the availability of effective treatments, long-term patient compliance, and persistence with osteoporosis drugs is often suboptimal, resulting in reduced protection from fractures. There have been encouraging developments in the osteoporosis drug pipeline. Novel agents may offer superior benefit-risk profiles and improved safety profiles compared with conventional treatment options. Many drugs have obtained approval while others are in different phases of development. For instance, drugs such as odanacatib (MK-0822) by Merck exert their pharmacological action by inhibiting the enzyme cathepsin K, which is primarily responsible for the degradation of the bone matrix by osteoclasts. Unlike the antiresorptive drugs in the market, odanacatib targets the resorption process only and does not interfere with osteoclast stimulation during bone formation. Blosozumab (LY2541546) by Eli Lilly binds and neutralizes sclerostin. Blosozumab and odanacatib are some of the late-stage pipeline molecules expected to be launched during the forecast period. Similarly, the rheumatoid arthritis drugs market will witness the entry of novel molecules during the forecast period. The market entry of these advanced drug molecules is expected to increase their uptake due to improved efficacy, and would thus help in market growth. Technological advancements in medical imaging Early diagnosis of diseases is an important parameter to increase life expectancy. The availability of advanced medical imaging equipment has helped offer better medical outcomes. The technological advancements in medical imaging have improved the diagnosis of musculoskeletal disorders. The accurate diagnosis of a musculoskeletal disorder can influence 60% of physician's decision-making process to prescribe a treatment regimen for patients. Advances in the medical imaging field will indirectly increase the treatment-seeking population and can decrease the undiagnosed population, thereby increasing the penetration rate of drugs. The medical imaging methods used to diagnose musculoskeletal disorders include MRI, CT, and X-rays. Vendors are developing 2D, 3D, and 4D equipment in the area of medical imaging. These devices help minimize distortion in images and offer accurate real-time visualization of the anatomy. "Thus, with the availability of automated, versatile, and easy to use medical imaging equipment, physicians can diagnose the exact cause and nature of a disease accurately, thereby increasing the treatment- seeking population," says Barath.

That’s Just Silly. Buffett Bails on Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) Stock. Should You? Fight Deflation With United States Steel Corporation (X), AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS) View All Posts Bayer AG (ADR) (OTCMKTS:BAYRY) rose 3% in early Wednesday trade after its $66 billion, $128-per-share bid  for Monsanto Company (NYSE:MON) was accepted. Top executives appeared on TV to say they expect regulators to approve it, and Bayer stock was lifted in response. Monsanto stock barely reacted to the deal on Wednesday morning, still hovering near the pre-bid price of $107, a value of $46.2 billion. That is doubtless due to the regulatory juggernaut that Bayer’s deal still has to go through, with both European and American agencies showing increased skepticism toward big deals of any sort. The deal would consolidate a global farming chemical-and-seed business at a time of global glut in farm commodities. I drove through the Midwest several times in the last month, and the corn really was as high as an elephant’s eye, the soybeans super-abundant in the fields. This is thanks in large part to genetically-modified seed and fertilizers made by Monsanto. But if it goes through, expect good things from Bayer and BAYRY stock. The Terms of the Deal The terms of the deal, announced in a press release, include $19 billion in new Bayer stock, in the form of mandatory convertible shares with subscription rights, and $47 billion in cash, to be financed through a $57 billion bridge loan which has already been obtained. If the deal falls through, Monsanto gets a $2 billion break-up fee. 10 Growth Stocks That Will Outrun Google The price is 44% more than Monsanto was worth in May, and 19% above the $106 per share it was worth before the deal was announced. Assuming the deal does go through, the shareholders are going to do very well. The question becomes whether there can be big farming profits in a world of GMO, and whether BAYRY can capture them at the hefty price it is paying. The answer, of course, is yes. Making It Work What is working with grains can work with other agricultural commodities. Genetic engineering is really just an acceleration in the cross-breeding technology we have been using for centuries, techniques we’ve been using on cats and dogs for millennia. Ironically, Bayer becomes the largest player in GMOs at a time when the German government is among the most skeptical in the world about them. Before this deal, Bayer was basically a medical company. The soccer team it launched in 1904 still has a Bayer aspirin tablet on its club shield. Its drugs include Cipro, Levitra, Xarelto and the Yaz line of birth control products. It’s more heavily involved in consumer products, like Aleve, Claritin, One-a-Day, and in and animal health products like Advantix. Regulators may protest that Monsanto makes GMOs a two-way race between Bayer, a German company, and Syngenta AG (ADR) (NYSE:SYT), whose sale to ChemChina is now being finalized. Monsanto would give Bayer a market cap north of $130 billion — hefty, but still well short of pharmaceutical giants like Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Johnson & Johnson Inc. (NYSE:JNJ). That’s part of the hope here — that Monsanto’s roughly $15 billion in annual sales, and $3.5 billion in net income, can deliver to Bayer the financial kick it needs to play in those big leagues of drug discovery. This deal would more than double Bayer’s sales, and triple its net income. However, it may take up to two years to close, and would meanwhile occupy all of management’s time. More Deals On The Way Given the price, and what this does to the Bayer balance sheet, it seems inevitable that more deals are going to follow this one. The whole crop unit could become a new company, the consumer health units might be sold, or the pharmaceutical units could go on the market. Either way, it’s going to be interesting times for Bayer shareholders. My personal view is it’s going to be a profitable time, that the combined company, and its pieces, are going to be worth a lot more in two years than they are now.

He joins its roster of leaders from the private sector, academia and civil society, who are committed to accelerating the world’s transition to inclusive and sustainable growth. The Business Commission’s mission is to make a powerful case, supported by sound evidence, rigorous research and compelling real-world examples, for why business leaders should seize upon sustainable development as the greatest opportunity of a lifetime. Its purpose is to show how the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide the private sector with a framework for making a real difference in addressing the major developmental challenges that face us this century. Lord Mark Malloch-Brown, Chair of the Business Commission said: “The world cannot achieve sustainable development without the full engagement of the food and agriculture sectors, which are critical to achieving not just one, but the majority of the Global Goals. “Sunny’s leadership in agri-business will be essential to increasing the number of leaders who understand the incredible opportunity for both growth and sustainability in this sector.” The SDGs, launched in 2015, are 17 ambitious targets for ending hunger and poverty, reducing inequality and tackling climate change by 2030. The goals most clearly related to food and agriculture include Goal 2, which calls for an end to hunger, while Goal 12 calls for sustainable consumption and production, and Goal 13 which calls for mitigating the impacts of climate change. Other goals—ensuring decent work, health and well-being, gender equality and education—however, are also related to the food and agriculture sectors. Olam’s Co-Founder & Group CEO Sunny Verghese said: “One of the meanings of the word Olam is ‘enduring’ or ‘everlasting’. I believe the only way we can build an enduring business is to put sustainability at the heart of our business. This is reflected in ‘Growing Responsibly,’ our core purpose, which guides us to pursue profitable growth in an ethical, socially responsible and environmentally sustainable way. We have recently been recognised for this approach in Fortune “Change the World” list of 50 global companies. “As the world grapples with major developmental challenges including poverty, inequality, hunger, climate change impacts, depletion of natural capital and more, it is now critical for businesses, both large and small, to ensure that values and value creation are not traded off in the long run,” he said. “I am excited to join the Business Commission, as it seeks to inspire and catalyse companies to embed sustainability at the core of their businesses and aims to foster collaborations to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.” Sunny Verghese joins 31 other Commissioners, including CEOs Paul Polman, Unilever; Mads Nipper, Grundfos; Ken Frazier, Merck; John Fallon, Pearson; Ho Ching, Temasek; and Helen Hai, Made in Africa; as well as leaders from major business organisations including Lise Kingo, UN Global Compact; Peter Bakker, the World Business Council on Sustainable Development; Sharon Burrow, International Trade Union Confederation, and many others. Their expertise will be essential to shaping the Business Commission’s flagship report, to be published in January 2017, which will serve as the foundation for a number of activities to mobilise business leaders to align their companies with social and environmental impact.

The drugs discovery and developer noted in its stock market statement that it had indicated back in March, at the time of its full-year results, that it intended to focus more on the discovery side of things, and the implication is that this has been the reason behind the parting of the ways with Self. "Steve joined e-Therapeutics in December 2010 following a distinguished career at The Wellcome Foundation, Boots Healthcare and as R&D Director of Merck's Generic Global business. We thank him for his significant contribution to our activities and wish him continuing success in his new endeavours," said Iain Ross, executive chairman of e-Therapeutics. The company is clearly going through a transitional phase as the two most advanced of its discovery compounds approach the lead candidate selection process, ahead of entering pre-clinical development in the coming months. Professor Malcolm Young, who founded the company, stood down as chief executive in July, with chairman Ross assuming executive duties until a replacement can be found.

Several organisms are present in and on human bodies. Some organisms are normally harmless and even helpful. However, under certain circumstances, some organisms cause diseases. Infectious diseases spread from one person to another. Moreover, some are transmitted by bites from insects and animals. Infectious diseases also occur by consumption of contaminated food and water. For more information visit: https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/infectious-disease-treatment Signs and symptoms of infectious diseases depend on the type of organism and infection. Some of the most common symptoms of infectious diseases include fatigue and fever. Mild complaints of infectious diseases treated from rest and home remedies, while some life-threatening infections require hospitalization. Infectious diseases, such chickenpox and measles are prevented by vaccination. Frequent and thorough hand-washing also protect human body from infectious diseases. Moreover, anti-infective drugs play a vital role in the treatment of infectious diseases. Anti-infective drugs are used to kill and stop growth of microorganism. These drugs can act as a defense system for human body and neutralize the action of disease causative agents. Based on microorganism, anti-infective drugs are mainly categorized into antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal and antiparasitic drugs. The global infectious disease treatment market (https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/infectio...) is segmented into antibacterial drugs, antifungal drugs, antiviral drugs and antiparasitic drugs. Antibacterial drugs segment covers tetracyclines, beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, macrolides, phenicols, sulfonamides and quinolones. Antifungal segment includes azoles, echinodians, pyrimidines, polyenes and allylamines. Antiviral drugs segment covers HIV, hepatitis B and C treatment drugs. North America dominates the global infectious disease treatment market followed by Europe. The U.S., followed by Canada, is the largest market for infectious disease treatment in the North American region. Key driving factor for infectious disease treatment market in the region is increasing research activities on various types of diseases. Germany, France and the U.K. are some of the largest markets for infectious diseases in Europe. However, Asia-Pacific represents the fastest growing region in the global infectious disease treatment market. This is due to minimal wages and availability of skilled professionals in the region. These factors attract drug manufacturing companies to invest in the Asian countries. In addition, in developing countries, such as China and India, government has launched several programs and initiatives to increase awareness about infectious diseases. China, Japan and India are largest infectious disease treatment markets in the region. Request for Table of Content: https://www.psmarketresearch.com/enquiry-form.php?enqid=1... Some of the major competitors in the global infectious disease treatment market are F. Hoffmann-La Roche, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Gilead Sciences,  Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, AstraZeneca, Bayer AG, Novartis, Sanofi, AbbVie and Auritec Pharmaceuticals.

Cheryl Swanson (CherylSwanson) Sep 13, 2016 at 9:22AM Image source: Getty Images. Since the failure of Pfizer's (NYSE:PFE) $160 billion megadeal to buy Allergan and move its headquarters, on paper, to lower-tax Ireland, shares of the pharmaceutical giant have been moving upward. In fact, the stock is up around 12% since early April, when the likelihood of the merger being called off became apparent. More recently, Pfizer has announced some eye-popping deals to boost profits and sales quickly, including the $14 billion buyout of cancer biotech Medivation (NASDAQ:MDVN) and its blockbuster prostate cancer drug Xtandi. While I'm optimistic about Pfizer's future, the company needs to play its cards carefully in the next few quarters because big risks are lurking under the surface. In particular, here are three wild cards that could propel the big pharma's shares sharply downward in the next few months. The first wild card: Management scuttles the idea of a company split The idea of Pfizer splitting into two entities is front and center on shareholders' minds this year, with management saying a definitive decision should come by the end of 2016. Advocates of a split believe it would unlock significant shareholder value trapped in Pfizer's conglomerate structure. In particular, top revenue-generating assets, such as Ibrance, Enbrel, Lyrica, Eliquis, and Xeljanz, could be unchained from Pfizer's slower-moving product lines. Since Pfizer's top-line growth has been sagging, in part due to the difficulty of meaningfully growing revenues once a company exceeds $50 billion a year in revenue, it seems likely the market will punish the stock if the split doesn't happen. Add to that the fact the split is expected, with many analysts citing Pfizer's $17 billion deal to buy intravenous-drug maker Hospira, as well as the recent Medivation deal, being all about juicing up its divisions in preparation for a split. Pfizer has fended off years of relentless pressure from analysts and others to break up. In addition, the new acquisitions could just as easily indicate that management has now found ways to accelerate growth and profit without a split. That being said, I don't personally think it's likely the split will be called off -- but it's still a risk. The joker in the deck: Pipeline failures Pfizer's pipeline is one of the largest in the world, with over 90 drugs in clinical trials or beyond trials and registered with the FDA for approval. Of those, nine drugs are in the headline-generating registration phase. Given so many shots on goal, it's not just possible, but probable, that one or more drugs disappoint. One drug that could either shoot to stardom or flame out is avelumab. The oncology drug, co-developed with Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK), could be filed with the FDA as soon as the second half of 2016. Pfizer rates it as a significant pipeline opportunity, with estimated peak sales at $1.9 billion. With the expectations behind this drug, it needs to stay on its timeline. And then there's Ibrance, Pfizer's breast cancer-treating superstar. The drug is up for EU evaluation by the end of this year. Since this drug has immense potential, anything but a full-on approval would likely hurt Pfizer's stock. Also up for approval is a med from Pfizer's $5.5 billion deal to buy California-based Anacor Pharmaceuticals. The topical gel crisaborole, for eczema treatment, is currently under FDA review. Pfizer believes crisaborole could reach or exceed annual sales of $2 billion. A regulatory decision is expected by January 2017. The ace of spades: The acquisition spree doesn't pay off M&A deals are not a prescription that always works in a shareholder's favor. While Medivation fits well with Pfizer's bid to conquer cancer, pricing power in this therapy area could be winding down. While cancer drug prices have held up thus far, things could erode rapidly if the federal government goes beyond taking potshots at high-priced drugs and starts playing hardball. In addition, the current market frenzy around oncology assets is leading to acquirers paying top dollar. Indeed, all the jockeying with other drugmakers led to the Medivation deal costing Pfizer more than 14 times Medivation's revenue guidance for 2016. Medivation's lead drug, Xtandi, had $2.2 billion in revenue in the last four quarters, and it is projected to reach $4 billion in five years. But it may fall well short, since Xtandi faces competition from Johnson and Johnson's Zytiga. Worse, Medivation's two clinical-stage oncology assets, PARP inhibitor talazoparib and antibody pidilizumab, share the risk of any investigational drug -- they still have to run the FDA gauntlet. Always play cards close to chest, because no safe stocks exist Big pharma companies are often regarded as safe stocks, but that's an illusion. They can still present big risks for investors: Drugs in development often don't work, drugs fail in clinical trials, and the FDA can drop the ax. Even if drugs are approved, their addressable market can be snared by a competitor, or they may become targets for cost-conscious regulators. Let's not end on a gloomy note, because Pfizer looks to be on a good trajectory right now. In particular, Ibrance is a fantastic cornerstone to a growing cancer franchise, and the drugmaker's rising price in a listless market looks promising. But there's always the chance of a messy surprise coming, so keep your powder dry.   Cheryl Swanson owns shares of Allergan and Johnson and Johnson.

Also up for approval is a med from Pfizer's $5.5 billion deal to buy California-based Anacor Pharmaceuticals. The topical gel crisaborole, for eczema treatment, is currently under FDA review. Pfizer believes crisaborole could reach or exceed annual sales of $2 billion. A regulatory decision is expected by January 2017. The ace of spades: The acquisition spree doesn't pay off M&A deals are not a prescription that always works in a shareholder's favor. While Medivation fits well with Pfizer's bid to conquer cancer, pricing power in this therapy area could be winding down. While cancer drug prices have held up thus far, things could erode rapidly if the federal government goes beyond taking potshots at high-priced drugs and starts playing hardball. In addition, the current market frenzy around oncology assets is leading to acquirers paying top dollar. Indeed, all the jockeying with other drugmakers led to the Medivation deal costing Pfizer more than 14 times Medivation's revenue guidance for 2016. Medivation's lead drug, Xtandi, had $2.2 billion in revenue in the last four quarters, and it is projected to reach $4 billion in five years. But it may fall well short, since Xtandi faces competition from Johnson and Johnson's Zytiga. Worse, Medivation's two clinical-stage oncology assets, PARP inhibitor talazoparib and antibody pidilizumab, share the risk of any investigational drug -- they still have to run the FDA gauntlet. Always play cards close to chest, because no safe stocks exist Big pharma companies are often regarded as safe stocks, but that's an illusion. They can still present big risks for investors: Drugs in development often don't work, drugs fail in clinical trials, and the FDA can drop the ax. Even if drugs are approved, their addressable market can be snared by a competitor, or they may become targets for cost-conscious regulators. Let's not end on a gloomy note, because Pfizer looks to be on a good trajectory right now. In particular, Ibrance is a fantastic cornerstone to a growing cancer franchise, and the drugmaker's rising price in a listless market looks promising. But there's always the chance of a messy surprise coming, so keep your powder dry.   Cheryl Swanson owns shares of Allergan and Johnson and Johnson.

Login Register Public Release: 13-Sep-2016 Five ways to tackle the reproducibility crisis in biomedical research Cell Press Share  Print  E-Mail IMAGE: This figure shows issues contributing to suboptimal reproducibility of preclinical research. view more Credit: Daniel Drucker/Cell Metabolism 2016 Daniel Drucker's unofficial laboratory slogan is "I'd rather be third and right, than first and wrong." As a clinician-scientist who has spent 30 years developing new drugs for diabetes, gastrointestinal disease, and obesity, he has seen high-profile journal article after article proclaim the beginning of the end for these diseases, only for the findings to never be discussed again. This isn't dishonesty or fraud, he says, but the irreproducibility of these amazing discoveries reflects a culture that supports invalidated materials, unreported negative data, and authors overgeneralizing their results. In an op-ed published September 13 in Cell Metabolism, Drucker, of the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mt. Sinai Hospital in Toronto, discusses the chasm between biomedical scientists' astounding preclinical success and the meager clinical translatability. He also suggests ways that researchers can improve and standardize experiments so that the joy of exciting results can come with a rigorous scientific story. These include: 1. Apply Rules for Clinical Trials to Preclinical Research "If you did a clinical trial where you studied 100 patients and only reported data on those patients that fit your hypothesis, I can tell you that you would be fired," Drucker says. "Yet it is common practice to carry out dozens of basic science experiments and not report the majority of them--only the ones that the principle investigator is particularly smitten by are published." As a consequence, the results of many papers are indeed reproducible, if the experiment is precisely conducted with the same mice, which are the same age and the same sex, from the identical supplier, in the same location, with the same microbiota, etc. Failed experiments often don't get mentioned in the paper because it weakens the story that the researcher wants to send to the journal, he says. Negative results, even with slightly different experimental conditions, often mean a mid-tier publication, which is a cultural issue that fosters irreproducibility. 2. Test Hypotheses in More Than One Animal Model Drucker requires his students and postdocs to replicate the effects of a potential therapeutic in several animal models of diabetes or obesity before going on to explore the potential mechanism in tissue and cell cultures. This is a slow approach, and not always fruitful, but it does temper underdeveloped conclusions. An opposite strategy, used in many labs, is to search for an interesting elegant molecular mechanism using molecular and biochemical techniques ex vivo and then generate an animal model that supports these findings. These fast discoveries often come with publication in a top-tier journal and other accolades, but they can be more challenging to apply to human disease. "We would be serving the community better if we could reproduce really cool results in multiple animal models and not just report the ones that work," Drucker says. "We never even hear about the experiments that didn't work until someone else tries and fails to reproduce the findings in a different model. But there is no penalty or reward for producing more or less reproducible research, and no one keeps track of it." 3. Hold Reproducibility Symposia It is rare to see sessions at scientific meetings dedicated to reproducibility issues in research. These discussions do take place, Drucker says, but in hallways or bars, not a formal atmosphere. Having an honest public discussion of common problems and solution, and encouraging everyone to be more accountable for their work, would also set a positive example for young researchers. New methods and techniques are constantly available, and so there will likely always be ways for investigators to improve their practices. 4. Develop Reproducibility Reporting To improve accountability, Drucker envisions a future where an academic independent body develops a basic algorithm that could compute how reproducible or irreproducible a scientific paper proved to be. However, such an index could prove damaging, he says, as no one would want to be known as the king or queen of irreproducibility. "There are much more feasible ways to discuss the reproducibility of one's work that would be less challenging to arbitrate," he says. "For example, let's make it a feature, and the National Institutes of Health has started to do this but many grant agencies have not, to have a mandatory part of grant applications to track a senior researcher's record--allow them to present the most well-cited papers they've published and show examples of how the key findings within have been reproduced." 5. Improve Methods Reporting Another strategy for enabling research to be more easily reproduced is to include sufficient experimental detail, such as description of and source of reagents, cell lines, and animals used in each experiment, Drucker says. Simply enhancing journal requirements for more detailed reporting would increase the likelihood that future scientists can follow the same steps described in a paper. (Cell Press journals recently introduced STAR Methods, 10.1016/j.cell.2016.08.021, which consider such recommendations.) Drucker doesn't anticipate everyone will agree with his recommendations, but he and many others do think it is time to have regular, robust conversations about reproducibility. We can start to fix the problem by quantifying and keeping track of reproducibility while building policies that enforce good scientific practices, he says. ### Daniel Drucker is supported in part by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, a Canada Research Chair in Regulatory Peptides, and a Banting and Best Diabetes Centre-Novo Nordisk Chair in Incretin Biology. He has served as an advisor or consultant to Arisaph Pharmaceuticals, Intarcia, MedImmune, Merck Research Laboratories, Novo Nordisk, and Receptos Inc.
