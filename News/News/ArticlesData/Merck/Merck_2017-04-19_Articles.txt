Originally published at Health Care Renewal Perceptions that the US health care system is dysfunctional and needs major reform go way back.  A timeline from the Tampa Bay Times noted President Theodore Roosevelt’s proposal for a national health service in 1912.  Nonetheless, as we have discussed endlessly, most attempts at reform failed, and health care dysfunction seems to be getting worse. One big problem may be that we don’t understand how much discussion of health care reform is driven by those who benefit from the status quo. A Personal Anecdote When I began my academic career in 1983, I was often in the audience for talks about how to fix health care by people billed as experts.  Often these talks seemed oddly disconnected from the realities on the ground for a junior assistant professor with a lot of clinical and teaching responsbilities.  Worse, many of the solutions they offered seemed to entail greater burdens for health care professionals, with no obvious compensation other than the warm feeling that we would be benefiting society.  Who else these solutions might benefit was not discussed. One talk given a bit later stands out in my memory. On November 29, 2001, one Dr John W Rowe gave the prestigious Levinger Lecture at Brown University entitled “Good Health: Can we Afford It?” (referenced here, see items for 11/14 and 11/16)  As I recall, Dr Rowe spent considerable time scolding us hard working physicians for overuse of medical interventions leading to endless increases in health care costs, and promising more burdensome bureaucratic interventions to rein in our follies.  While promising more burdens on physicians, Dr Rowe did not dwell on how the resulting cost savings might benefit him in his role as CEO and Chairman of Aetna Inc.  Aetna had purchased the notoriously physician-unfriendly US Healthcare, and thus had become a big for-profit health care insurer already known for imposing bureaucratic burdens on physicians in hopes of decreasing their utilization, while increasing the company’s revenues (look here).  Were Dr Rowe’s pontifications really about improving health care for all Americans, or about justifying his previous management behavior, and perhaps supporting the price of his shares in Aetna? Why was Aetna’s public relations given the patina of an academic lecture? These days, health care professionals continue to be exhorted about health care reform.  Many such pontifications may be not so much about true health care reform as about preserving the fundamental status quo which has benefited and enriched so many insiders. The interests of the pontificators are often less obvious than those of Dr Rowe.  Maybe that is so why there has been so little real reform, and what little reform there has been seems to be under continuous attack. Two Examples of How Hard It Is to Discover the Interests of Health Care Policy Pontificators In the last few weeks I posted about two recent ostensibly authoritative pontifications.  One was about ways to address the worsening problem of physician burn-out (see this post). It was written by the CEOs of large, non-profit hospital systems, joined by the CEO of the American Medical Association.  The other was about a health care reform proposal from the prestigious National Academy of Medicine (see this post).  A rather uncritical article in the Washington Post hailed it as a “radical idea” because it was written by “doctors.” In both cases, I was skeptical, mainly because many of the proponents had conflicts of interest, mostly undisclosed, that suggested they were already benefiting mightily from the current system. However, it gets worse.  While I thought my posts were based on reasonable efforts to find undisclosed conflicts of interest affecting the authors of these exhortations, within a few weeks I realized I had missed one important item affecting each.  The lesson is that the web of conflicts of interest that ensnares the insiders who run most of US health care is even more complex and adherent than any of us realizes. Dr John Noseworthy, Author of the Health Affairs Post on Reducing Physician Burnout: CEO of the Mayo Clinic, But Also Now Nominated to be a Director of Merck Dr Noseworthy, CEO of the Mayo Clinic, was the lead author of a post in HealthAffairs about reducing physician burnout.  (Oddly enough, none of the proposed action items seemed to involve increasing physician autonomy by reducing the power of managers over health care professionals.) Two weeks after Noseworthy and colleagues’ post appeared, an article on the Minnesota Public Radio website reported that Dr Noseworthy has just been nominated to a seat on the Merck board of directors.  Presumably the possibility of this nomination had been known at the time the post was published. I had previously written that two of the authors of the Health Affairs post were on corporate boards.  One, Dr Paul Rothman, was already on the board of Merck.  As corporate directors, they have fiduciary responsibilties to promote the revenues of their corporations.  Now it turns out there were at least three such board members among the health system CEOs who had pontificated to physicians about how to reduce their burn-out. Yet the power of such health care systems, whose management is often mission-hostile, and who often put revenue ahead of physicians’ professional values (per the shareholder value theory), is arguably a major cause of physician burnout.  Furthermore, Merck, in particular, has had its share of management misbehavior as demonstrated by a recent $830 million settlement for deceiving shareholders, a mere $5.9 million 2015 settlement for deceptive marketing, and multiple setttlements, cumulatively totaling more than $1 billion, plus one guilty plea for the historic deceptive marketing of Vioxx (see this post). So to what extent are the authors of this pontification about reducing physician burnout (without really giving physicians much new autonomy) insiders benefiting from the status quo in health care?  It may be more than what we think, even now. Mr Leonard Schaeffer, Author of National Academy of Medicine Article on Health Care Reform: Member of the Boards of Wahlgreen Boots, Quintiles, scPharmaceuticals, but Also Long-Term Director of Amgen Mr Schaeffer was an author of the National Academy of Medicine article, now published online in JAMA, about health care reform.  (Oddly enough, none of the “vital directions issue areas” mentioned in the article involved real challenges to the power of large health care organizations, particularly for-profit corporations, or increased autonomy for health care professionals.) The version of the article published online by the NAM did not include any explicit disclosures of conflicts of interest.  It did note that two authors were full-time employees of health care corporations, one was a consultant to health care corporations, one was a lobbyist for health care corporations, and one was on the boards of health care corporations.  The online JAMA version added more disclosures, but these were incomplete.  In my post, I noted that fully 13 of the 19 authors had major ties to large health care corporations, as employees, lobbyists, consultants or  board members. In particular, Mr Leonard D Schaeffer was listed in the NAM version as simply affiliated with the University of Southern California, but I found was actually on the boards of Wahlgreens Boots Alliance, Quintiles Transnational, and scPharmaceuticals Inc.  That was still an incomplete picture of his conflicts of interest. A ProPublica article from February, 2017 recounted how big pharmaceutical companies engaged Precision Health Economics to wage public relations campaigns to try to justify high pharmaceutical prices.  The article noted the following about Mr Schaeffer. Amgen has ties to all three founders of Precision Health Economics. Working for other firms, Philipson has twice testified as an expert witness for Amgen, defending the company’s rights to drug patents, according to his curriculum vitae. The other two founders, Goldman and Lakdawalla, are principals at the Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics at USC, which received $500,000 in late 2016 from Amgen for an ‘innovation initiative,’ according to public disclosures. Goldman said the funds were unrestricted and could be used at the center’s discretion. Robert Bradway, the CEO and chair of Amgen, is on the advisory board of the university center, and Leonard Schaeffer, a professor at USC and the namesake of the center, sat on Amgen’s board of directors for nearly a decade. With funding from Amgen, the Schaeffer Center hosted a forum in Washington, D.C., in October 2015 on the affordability of specialty drugs. Before a panel focused on the new cholesterol treatment, Goldman cautioned against lowering drug prices. So Mr Schaeffer, in addition to his current board positions, turns out to have had a long relationship with Amgen.  Given that according to the 2013 Amgen proxy statement, Mr Schaeffer retired from the board with at least 28,277 shares of Amgen stock and options for 15,000 more, he may have current financial ties to the company. So once again, to what extent were the authors of the 2017 NAM report on health care reform (which did not challenge the influence of large health care corporations over the health of US citizens) insiders benefiting from the status quo in health care?  It may be more than what we think, even now. Summary Health care professionals, policy makers, and the public are constantly harangued by apparently unbaised experts about health care reform.  Yet many of these authorities are insiders who benefit from the status quo.  Many of their financial connections to the corporations that make the most money from the US commercialized health care system are not disclosed.  It may take considerable investigation to determine their involvement in a web of conflicts of interest that drapes over the US health care system. Meanwhile, audiences should demand that those who lecture us about health care reform disclose all their financial conflicts of interest.  Any whiff of deception about their personal interests should suggest intense skepticism. True health care reform requires honest discussion of the issues.  Honesty in this case entails complete and detailed disclosure of the discussants’ conflicts of interest. Until such honest is the rule, be very, very careful about taking sanctimonious spiels at face value. 00001 This entry was posted in Banana republic, Free markets and their discontents, Guest Post, Health care, Media watch, Ridiculously obvious scams, The destruction of the middle class on April 20, 2017 by Yves Smith.

The NHS grew out of the Emergency Medical Service of WWII handling civilian casualties of bombing and keeping a healthy population for fighting and national stability. Most European countries (except Switzerland) were combat zones with displaced population and disease. The need to provide full cover to protect against cross-infection was the basis of total cover. The USA has not faced such a situation since 1865. No Japanese invasion or bombing on Mainland USA Reply ↓ Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Merck Underscores Continued Commitment to Fighting Infectious Diseases With More than 25 Data Presentations at ECCMID 2017 KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that researchers are scheduled to provide more than 25 scientific data presentations on the company’s established and investigational infectious disease medicines at this year’s 27th European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ECCMID), April 22-25 in Vienna, Austria. “Infectious diseases remain one of the great public health threats in the world today. At Merck, we have never wavered in our commitment to invest in developing anti-infective therapies that prevent and treat serious infectious diseases,” said Dr. Nicholas Kartsonis, vice president, infectious disease clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. “We also continue to collaborate with researchers, clinicians and other stakeholders worldwide to advocate for responsible use of these important medicines.” Presentations at ECCMID 2017 will include topline data from the pivotal Phase 3 clinical study of letermovir, Merck’s investigational antiviral medicine for prevention of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection or disease in adult CMV-seropositive recipients of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Researchers also will present “real-world use” data as well as data on the in vitro activity of ZERBAXA® 1.5 g (ceftolozane 1 g and tazobactam 0.5 g). ZERBAXA is indicated for the treatment of adults with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), including pyelonephritis, and in combination with metronidazole, complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) caused by designated susceptible Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Other studies to be presented include data on the in vitro activity of relebactam, Merck’s investigational beta-lactamase inhibitor, in combination with imipenem/cilastatin (an approved carbapenem antibiotic), collected as part of the SMART (Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends) surveillance program. SMART was initiated by Merck in 2002 to monitor the in vitro susceptibility of clinical isolates to several commonly used antibiotics in different regions of the world to monitor changing trends in antibiotic susceptibility. Bacterial samples have been collected and characterized from patients with intra-abdominal, urinary tract and lower-respiratory tract infections.

Merck’s commitment to infectious diseases For more than 80 years, Merck has contributed to the discovery and development of novel medicines and vaccines to combat infectious diseases. In addition to a combined portfolio of antibiotic and antifungal medicines, vaccines, and medicines for HIV and HCV, Merck has multiple programs that span discovery through late-stage development. Merck currently has nine compounds in Phase 2/Phase 3 clinical trials for the potential treatment or prevention of infectious diseases. About ZERBAXA ZERBAXA (ceftolozane and tazobactam) is an antibacterial combination product for intravenous infusion consisting of the cephalosporin antibacterial drug ceftolozane sulfate and the beta-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam sodium. ZERBAXA is approved in the United States and is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), including pyelonephritis, caused by the following Gram-negative microorganisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. ZERBAXA used in combination with metronidazole is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) caused by the following Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms: Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus salivarius. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ZERBAXA and other antibacterial drugs, ZERBAXA should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Important Safety Information about ZERBAXA Patients with renal impairment: Decreased efficacy of ZERBAXA has been observed in patients with baseline CrCl of 30 to ≤50 mL/min. In a clinical trial, patients with cIAIs with CrCl >50 mL/min had a clinical cure rate of 85.2% when treated with ZERBAXA plus metronidazole vs. 87.9% when treated with meropenem. In the same trial, patients with CrCl 30 to ≤50 mL/min had a clinical cure rate of 47.8% when treated with ZERBAXA (ceftolozane and tazobactam) plus metronidazole vs. 69.2% when treated with meropenem. A similar trend was also seen in the cUTI trial. Monitor CrCl at least daily in patients with changing renal function and adjust the dose of ZERBAXA accordingly. Hypersensitivity: ZERBAXA is contraindicated in patients with known serious hypersensitivity to ceftolozane/tazobactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, or other members of the beta-lactam class. Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactam antibacterials. Before initiating therapy with ZERBAXA, make careful inquiry about previous hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins, penicillins, or other beta-lactams. If an anaphylactic reaction to ZERBAXA occurs, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. Clostridium difficile–associated diarrhea (CDAD), ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis, has been reported with nearly all systemic antibacterial agents, including ZERBAXA. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is confirmed, antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile should be discontinued, if possible. Development of drug-resistant bacteria: Prescribing ZERBAXA in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Adverse reactions: The most common adverse reactions occurring in ≥5% of patients were headache (5.8%) in the cUTI trial, and nausea (7.9%), diarrhea (6.2%) and pyrexia (5.6%) in the cIAI trial.

Cardiovascular Players Could Be Eyeing Esperion Asset Planning Services, Ltd. Buys Merck, iShares Core S&P Total U.S. ... (GuruFocus) Leading Biosciences is a small biopharmaceutical company focused on addressing the breakdown of the intestinal mucosal barrier using a simple technology platform. While privately held, this firm has been around for more than a decade. Benzinga met with CEO Tom Hallam, Ph.D., and Chief Financial Officer JD Finley recently and had the chance to shoot a few questions. What Leading Biosciences Does BZ: Can you tell our readers what you do? Tom Hallam: Our technology is amazing, and very simple. It’s about the digestive enzymes in our body and all of our gastrointestinal tract. Sometimes they leak out — which they shouldn’t, and when that happens [...] they basically digest our bodies on a really small scale, and that causes a lot of chronic diseases, and in some cases, when it’s really bad, a lot of acute crises for patients. So, we’re focused on this idea that we can stop that. BZ: So, you’re precommercial? Hallam: We’re a precommercial company. We’re currently in two different ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials. The first is a trial that’s ongoing in Asia right now; we’re enrolling cardiovascular surgery patients. The second is a clinical trial in the United States that is enrolling patients for gastrointestinal surgery. In addition, we’ll soon have a small investigator-sponsored study looking at septic shock. BZ: Which indications are you targeting? Hallam: There are a lot of different indications we’re looking at, but most importantly we’re really talking about GI [gastro intestinal] surgery. That is the big value driver for the company.  Let me back up; I’ll show you why. There is a moment in every GI surgery where the surgeon takes a scalpel and he makes an incision into the bowel, the GI tract in particular. What happens in that moment is all of those digestive enzymes in the GI tract spill into abdominal cavity [...] They attack the muscles that disrupt the motility in the intestine and it causes this big inflammatory response in the body [...] so the bowel basically stops moving; it has to repair itself for a few days. That’s a really big problem for patients [...] because once the surgery is finished, the patient can’t be discharged from the hospital until he/she has had a bowel movement. If you look at the numbers, they say that if you’re an average person getting bowel surgery, particularly with a couple co-morbidities, you’re going to be in the hospital for one week to two weeks. And that length of stay is just waiting for that bowel function to return. What we’ve shown in all of our preclinical studies is that we can have a very rapid return of bowel function, like as early as on the same day as the GI surgery. The Potential BZ: What is the market potential here? Hallam: What we believe is that we can pretreat patients with our drug, which inhibits those digestive enzymes before they spill into the cavity. So, they’re going to still spill, but they’re not going to be active when they do it. By preventing that damage, the motility will still be there; the bowel will kick back into gear in a couple days, and the patient will be discharged from the hospital in a day or two. This has an impact for the hospitals, from the fact that they can have a higher level of turnover and help patients get home faster. And, it helps the patient because they’re not waiting in a hospital to go home BZ: Do you have a number for the savings that you can generate for each patient for this drug? Also, what is the size of the addressable market? JD Finley: The savings from the hospitals perspective is very large.  For acute care hospital stay, it averages $3,500 a day. So, if you shave one day of hospital stay off of that patient’s stay in the hospital and taking into account that there are 10 million abdominal surgeries annually, that translates into multimillion-dollar savings. If we price our drug at a very conservative price of $500 per dose, and assuming we only capture about 10 percent or 20 percent of the market, that could translate into over $1 billion of annual sales from the drug. BZ: You said you’re Phase 2 right now. Where do you stand in the FDA process? Hallam: From the FDA process, we have this great thing that came before us. Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) has a drug that’s currently approved for return of bowel function; it’s basically, an m-opioid receptor antagonist. And, this is what we know about that drug: when that drug was originally bought, the company that bought it basically spent $417 million for that acquisition. The drug delivers a one-day improvement in return of bowel function, and has some really bad side effects; it causes an increase in heart attacks and cardiovascular events, and it is only available through a special FDA program that restricts use to special hospitals. So, most hospitals don’t use the drug. But the great thing is, that drug paved the pathway for how to get there. They created this entire community of investigators that know how to run these clinical trials, the key opinion leaders that understand the right patient endpoints and how to treat the patients in the clinical trials from that perspective. We are currently partnering with the Cleveland Clinic in Florida, the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Mt. Sinai here in New York City, and the University of California, San Diego, and the University of California, Irvine for running our clinical trials. By having them design and participate in our trial, they not only know how to get there in the best way, and enroll the patients, but they know how to hit the bar to get to the FDA approval. From our conversations with the FDA, we likely only need this single Phase 2 clinical trial, and one Phase 3 trial to get to approval, basically because our drug is made of components that are already approved by the FDA. The active ingredient has been used in over 30,000 different clinical trials. BZ: Do you have an estimated timeline for the FDA process? Hallam: From the company perspective, we expect to finish enrollment of our clinical trials in 2017, and then we would go and start enrollment of the Phase 3, likely in 2018. Those would wrap up in 2019 and ideally, we would have a drug on the market in 2020 Financials BZ: Do you have any plans to raise capital and/or go public? Finley: Right now we’re in the market for a very small bridge round to get to a $15 to $25 million private round. Following that we’ll evaluate our options for funding the Phase 3 trial; one of the options we are examining is taking the company public at that point. BZ: Who are the competitors in the space? Hallam: The biggest competitor is Entereg, produced by Merck, and the process to use it is quite complex and requires specialized training. The FDA has set up a high bar use, which has led to a very low adoption. Instead, what our drug is and how it competes with that in particular is, we have a safety profile that is well known; we have a single treatment that we think will be at a relatively good price point; and that it basically flows into the bowel prep process for the patient. BZ: JD, what’s one goal you have as a CFO for 2017? Finley: For 2017, the major goal is to complete the funding to get us through the end of the Phase 2 clinical trials so we can be prepared for Phase 3 next year. BZ: Tom, what’s one goal you have as a CEO for 2017? Hallam: To keep our clinical trial engines moving. We deliver value to our shareholders really be doing two things: by protecting our discoveries with intellectual property (and we’ve got great intellectual property patent fortresses around our lead drug), and then we deliver shareholder value by delivering the data in our clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our drug. This is really that year where I see we will have a big proof of concept for our lead drug and clinical trials. A Proven Management Team BZ: We’ve heard good things about your background, Tom. Would you tell us about it? Hallam: Well, thanks. Over my career, I’ve been lucky and fortunate to be part of a number of different clinical trials. Out of 27 trials I’ve been a part of, 25 hit their efficacy endpoints. So basically, I have experienced delivering over and over again success in the clinic. We have a management team that’s been successful at delivering trials in the clinic. We have the key opinion leaders that have already done trials in this space and they know how to run them and do them. We have a drug that’s proven to be very efficacious in preclinical studies and we have some early clinical data in our Phase 1 study that says we’re going to hit this endpoint as well. All the indications are that it’s a little de-risked opportunity and that we’ve got all the team and processes in place to make this a big success.

The Merck-AGITG Research Fellowship has been established by the Australasian Gastro-Intestinal Trials Group (AGITG) with Merck’s support. This Fellowship will provide a candidate with the opportunity to study for 12 months at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London. Managing Director, Merck Biopharma, Australia and New Zealand, Mr Drew Young said, "Merck is very proud to be supporting this important initiative which encourages Australian research and knowledge in the specialist area of gastrointestinal cancer. "Unfortunately, Australia has one of the highest rates of colorectal cancer in the world and we all need to do more to address this devastating disease. Merck supplies specialised medicines for the treatment of several cancers and has a firm commitment to working with research organisations, clinicians and patients to achieve better outcomes in oncology. This new Fellowship grant is another example of our contribution." Professor Tim Price, Chair of the AGITG said, "The overall objective of the Research Fellowship is to increase collaboration between the UK, Australia and New Zealand. Our collaborative efforts will be enhanced by this opportunity for an Australian or New Zealand senior Medical Oncology trainee to work at the Royal Marden Hospital in London. The Fellow will further their clinical research training and exposure to GI cancer research while working in this dedicated cancer institution with opportunities to develop additional contacts and links with major cancer units around the UK and in Europe". "Merck’s generous support will enable the Fellow to not only be immersed in a UK cancer care unit but will also potentially allow for AGITG clinical trial research to be further developed in the UK. Furthermore the links that will develop by working within the UK system and Europe will also be of great value both for the individual and the AGITG in the future, enhancing future clinical research collaboration." An initial cheque for $75,000 has been formally presented to AGITG by Mr Young on behalf of Merck (picture below). Fellowship candidates can now apply via the AGITG website https://agitg.org.au/ Candidates will be subject to peer review with the successful applicant notified by early July at the latest and formally announced by the AGITG at its annual conference from 4-6 October 2017. Merck is also a proud sponsor of the AGITG Kristian Anderson Award, named in honour of Kristian Anderson who died in 2012 after waging an international campaign in support of better and more affordable treatments for people with bowel cancer. The 2-year award totalling $36,700 supports an Australian clinician undertaking a higher degree (MD, PhD) to research an aspect of personalised medicine in the area of colorectal cancer. Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. Merck Oncology promotes, and continues to develop, novel cancer-specific therapies that provide beneficial therapeutic outcomes and new options for cancer patients.

Inc. vs. Johnson & Johnson Does Merck's sizzling-hot cancer drug Keytruda give it a leg up over longtime winner Johnson & Johnson? Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) Apr 19, 2017 at 3:47PM If you'd been given the choice between buying either Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) stock or Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock 10 years ago, the smart choice would have definitely been J&J. The healthcare giant's stock proved to be a much bigger winner. But that was then. Which of these two stocks is the better pick for investors now? Here's how Merck and Johnson & Johnson compare. Image source: Getty Images. The case for Merck Merck lays claim to an asset that it didn't have a decade ago -- Keytruda. The cancer drug first won FDA approval in 2014 for treating advanced melanoma. Since then, Keytruda has been approved for four other indications plus expanded approval as a first-line treatment for melanoma. Keytruda is the cornerstone of the investing argument for Merck. Sales for the drug topped $1.4 billion last year. Analysts think Keytruda can reach peak annual sales of close to $8 billion, so there should be plenty of growth potential remaining.  Although Keytruda is definitely the most important component for Merck's growth strategy, the company thinks its pipeline can produce more winners. Experimental diabetes drug ertugliflozin, which Merck is co-developing with Pfizer, appears to have huge potential.  Some of Merck's pipeline candidates could have much lower chances of success. Results are expected from a late-stage study of experimental cardiovascular drug anacetrapib within the next few months. Two other pharmaceutical companies failed in their attempts to advance drugs that use a similar mechanism of action. Merck is crossing its fingers for positive results in a late-stage study of verubecestat in treating Alzheimer's disease, but the drug has already flopped in another study for the indication.  Merck also faces declining sales for several of its top-selling products, including autoimmune-disease drug Remicade and cholesterol drug Vytorin. However, the company should still be able to grow earnings by nearly 7% annually over the next few years, thanks largely to climbing sales for Keytruda. In addition, Merck's dividend yield of 2.98% provides a nice bonus for investors. The case for Johnson & Johnson Johnson & Johnson has a cancer drug with fast-growing sales and considerable potential as well. However, J&J partner AbbVie takes a bigger chunk of sales from Imbruvica than Johnson & Johnson does.  It's the same story with another of Johnson & Johnson's current winners. J&J made nearly $2.3 billion on anticoagulant Xarelto last year -- up almost 23% from the prior year. However, Bayer received around $3.1 billion from the drug. But growth is growth, and Johnson & Johnson should get plenty of growth from other current drugs. Darzalex appears to have solid potential. It's already approved as a second-line treatment for multiple melanoma in combination with Revlimid or Velcade. The drug is being evaluated in late-stage clinical studies in combination with other drugs as a first-line treatment for the indication. Niraparib, which J&J licensed from Tesaro, recently won approval as a maintenance treatment for recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. The drug could become another blockbuster for Johnson & Johnson. Like Merck, Johnson & Johnson has a few challenges. One stems from a product that the two companies have a partnership -- Remicade. J&J is being hurt by declining Remicade sales even worse than Merck is. Also, Johnson & Johnson's consumer and medical device business segments aren't contributing much growth for the company. Despite these headwinds, Wall Street analysts think that Johnson & Johnson will grow earnings by an average annual rate of nearly 6% over the next few years. As is the case with Merck, J&J's dividend yield of 2.6% along with its stellar track record of increasing its dividend gives investors an added reason to like the stock. Better buy All the numbers point to Merck being the better buy between these two healthcare leaders. Merck should have slightly better earnings growth. It boasts a higher dividend yield. Merck's valuation also looks more attractive than J&J's does. My instinct, however, is to give the nod to Johnson & Johnson. The company's planned acquisition of Actelion should strengthen its pipeline. There's also an intangible factor with J&J: Long-term investors just love the stock. Johnson & Johnson outperformed every other big pharma stock last year, despite having lower earnings growth than several others (including Merck). Both of these stocks are solid picks, in my view. If I could only buy one, though, I'd go with Johnson & Johnson. Investing isn't always merely a numbers game.   Keith Speights owns shares of AbbVie and Pfizer.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Hospital Acquired Infection Treatment Market Research Report : Forecast upto 2024 The global market for hospital acquired infection (HAI) treatment features an exceedingly fragmented vendor landscape, with no leading vendor accounting for a dominant share in the market in 2015, observes Transparency Market Research in a recent report. Notable players in the market, including Merck & Co., Inc., Abbott, Bayer AG, and Pfizer, Inc., struggle for profitable returns amid the emerging threat of generics following patent expirations of several blockbuster drugs. Although strict barriers in form of complex approval procedures and stringent regulatory framework in several regional markets exist, the market has witnessed the entry of a large number of new players in the past few years. The threat of new entrants remains high in the near future owing to the promising market for generics and a slew of new players is expected to enter the global HAI treatment market in the next few years, further intensifying the level of competition. Transparency Market Research states that the global HAI treatment market will exhibit a moderate 2.7% CAGR from 2016 through 2024, rising from a valuation of US$28.99 bn in 2015 to US$36.61 bn in 2024. Browse full report on Hospital Acquired Infection Treatment Market – www.transparencymarketresearch.com/hospital-acquired-infe… North America Market to Retain Dominance Of the key HAI treatment types examined in the report, the segment of antibacterial treatment takes the lead in terms of demand and consumption. The rising prevalence of hospital acquired bacterial infections across the globe is likely to allow the segment of antibacterial treatment retain its dominance in the global HAI treatment market over the forecast period. From a geographical perspective, the global HAI treatment market is dominated by North America, followed by Europe. The regional market valued at US$10,272.70 mn in 2016 and is expected to retain its dominant position over the forecast period as well. The rapidly rising pool of geriatric patients and the presence of some of the world’s leading pharmaceutical companies will allow the region to remain dominant. Rising Geriatric Population and Increased Demand across Emerging Economies to Propel Market Some of the chief factors that are presently driving the global demand for effective HAI treatments are the rising geriatric population and the increased focus on improving healthcare infrastructures in developing and less-developed economies. The geriatric population is more prone to a number of infections and are a demographic that account for a massive share in the overall expenditure on healthcare and wellness spent by any society. The threat of developing nosocomial infections is significantly high in elderly people owing to their low immunity to diseases. Therefore, as the world’s population ages, the demand for HAI treatment methods is also expected to rise at a significant pace in the next few years. Rising Numbers of Multidrug Resistance Microorganisms Drive Demand for Alternative Treatments One of the key factor hindering the growth of the global HAI treatment market is the steadily rising numbers of multidrug resistance (MDR) microorganisms that resist multiple antimicrobial drugs. Resistance to most available treatment methods and drugs is threatening the public health and pressuring the healthcare industry to find alternative treatments, restricting the adoption of standard nosocomial infection drugs to a notable extent. Nevertheless, the market could benefit from the several drug candidates for treating hospital acquired infections that are presently in the pipelines of some of the leading pharmaceutical companies of the globe. The increasing focus on the rising prevalence of HAIs in emerging economies has generated vast untapped growth opportunities in the form of elderly population from the lower and middle income categories. These opportunities can prove to be beneficial for established players as well as new entrants in regions such as Asia Pacific and Latin America.

Central to AstraZeneca's case is a trial called MYSTIC which is testing the drugs durvalumab and tremelimumab in lung cancer. If initial results to be reported at mid-year indicate success, this could confirm the company's place at oncology's top table. But the market for medicines boosting the immune system's ability to fight tumours is increasingly competitive and the science is moving fast, raising questions as to whether AstraZeneca can produce a knock-out win. Merck & Co, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Roche already have similar drugs approved in lung cancer and the race is on to launch effective combinations for previously untreated disease in patients - a potentially huge market. "I think there will be multiple approvals in the first-line (untreated) space," Naiyer Rizvi, head of thoracic oncology at Columbia University Medical Center, told Reuters. "The question is going to be how do you position all these different options." Durvalumab and tremelimumab are immuno-oncology (I-O) drugs which, by helping the body's immune cells kill cancer, offer an alternative to toxic chemotherapy. While not without side effects, I-O is a kinder option that also promises longer-lasting efficacy, although the high cost is a concern. Analysts at Jefferies see a $20 billion opportunity for I-O drugs in first-line non-small cell lung cancer, with sales split between I-O monotherapy (administering one such medicine on its own); I-O plus conventional chemotherapy; and combinations of two I-O drugs, as in AstraZeneca's approach. "There's a critical unmet need, which is why there is so much excitement about immunotherapies and so much activity," said Rob Iannone, AstraZeneca's head of late-stage I-O development. "Current outcomes are still very, very poor." As experience builds with using the new agents, rival drugmakers have been busily amending clinical trial plans to keep up with a shifting landscape, while also launching new studies to exploit a coming second generation of I-O medicines. The issue has been further complicated by doubts over how to identify patients who will benefit. The latest data suggests that the level of mutation in tumours may be a better biomarker than the current widely used benchmark, a protein called PDL-1. "PDL-1 is a bit of a blunt instrument," said Rizvi. "In future, I think you will see a lot better science around identifying patients based on their genetics." BIG SHARE PRICE SWING AstraZeneca shares, which at around 46 pounds still trail the 55 pounds offered by Pfizer in 2014, are expected to move sharply up or down on the MYSTIC data. But the result may not be as clear-cut as some investors hope because the full data will emerge in stages. Headline news on progression-free survival (PFS), or extending the time before cancer worsens, is due in June or July, with details following later, possibly at the European Society for Medical Oncology congress in Madrid in September. Doctors, patients and investors may have to wait until 2018 to learn whether durvalumab and tremelimumab actually help patients live longer by extending overall survival (OS). Given the competitive landscape, the pressure is on to achieve both PFS and OS. "In the first-line setting, I think it is important to hit both," said Rizvi, who is principal investigator for the MYSTIC trial. Indeed, a miss on PFS could be enough to mark AstraZeneca as a likely loser in the multibillion-dollar I-O race, according to UBS analysts. AstraZeneca's Iannone sees it rather differently, arguing that the durable response generated by I-O drugs makes long-term survival, not PFS, the gold standard test. "It looks as if OS is a more robust endpoint," he said. "We want to preserve PFS, even if we know that the study might ultimately have to wait for OS to appreciate the full benefit." Importantly, AstraZeneca has built multiple options into its trial design, with potential to prove that durva/treme can help all patients or a subset with high levels of PDL-1. In addition, durvalumab is being tested on its own. Back in 2014, AstraZeneca predicted durvalumab could have peak sales of $6.5 billion, including combination therapies, making it the biggest contributor to revenue growth. Current analyst forecasts are only around half this level, according to Thomson Reuters data, making the next few weeks pivotal in building or eroding expectations. AstraZeneca has two chances to build confidence ahead of MYSTIC, with durvalumab potentially winning approval in bladder cancer - a relatively small market - and data also due from a lower-profile lung cancer trial called ARCTIC. But rivals are moving fast. Merck is expected to get a U.S. green light to sell a combination of its I-O drug Keytruda and chemotherapy in first-line lung cancer by May 10, while Bristol-Myers and Roche also have important upcoming combination data. All of this makes success critical for AstraZeneca, which is struggling with falling sales from loss of patents on blockbusters such as cholesterol drug Crestor and is doing external deals to help fund new-drug research. Pfizer may have left the stage but some analysts and bankers believe AstraZeneca could become a target again in any future wave of pharmaceutical industry consolidation.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Global Pharmerging Market: Increasing Government Expenditure on Healthcare to Boost Growth According to a new study by Transparency Market Research (TMR), the global pharmerging market is highly competitive in nature. Led by Johnson & Johnson, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Novartis AG, and Merck & Co. Inc., the market demonstrates an extremely fragmented structure. The leading players are focusing on product innovation to strengthen their market presence, which, consequently, is increasing research and development activities in the market. Over the coming years, the involvement of these players will increase in mergers and acquisitions directed towards the expansion of their businesses, states the research report. Obtain Report Details @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/pharmerging-market.html As per TMR’s estimations, the global market for pharmerging stood at US$552.8 mn in 2015. Researchers expect it to rise at a CAGR of 11.30% during the period from 2016 to 2024 and reach a value of US$1.40 bn by the end of the forecast period. The market has been witnessing a higher demand for pharmaceuticals products and the trend is expected to continue over the next few years, thanks to the growing requirement of branded as well as generic drugs. Hospitals to Emerge as Key Distribution Channel Hospitals, clinics, retail pharmacies, e-commerce, and drug stores have been considered as the key types of distribution channels in the global market for pharmerging in this research report. The hospitals segment has surfaced as the most attractive distribution channel among these, thanks to the increased emphasis on establishing hospitals as primary care providers and the rising number of state-of-art hospital chains across the world. With the rise in the government investments to improve the accessibility to medicine at affordable price, this segment is likely to retain its position during the forecast period. On the geographical front, the research report has classified the worldwide pharmerging market into Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, Asia Pacific, North America, and Europe. Asia Pacific dominated this market in 2016 with a share of 53%. Supported by the swift urbanization, infrastructural advancements in the medical and healthcare industry, and the rising investments for medical research, this regional market is likely to remain on the top throughout the forecast period. Driven by technological advancements, the markets for pharmerging in Europe and Latin America are also expected to experience a substantial rise in the near future. Fill the Form for an Exclusive Sample of this Report @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Constant Research and Development to Drive Market “The global market for pharmerging is heavily driven by the increasing expenditure by various governments across the world on healthcare,” says an analyst at TMR. The increasing prevalence of various diseases and the rise in healthcare issues have increased the government interventions in terms of providing healthcare services, which are accessible to all at affordable prices, reflecting positively on the growth of this market. The constant research and development in the field of pharmerging is also adding substantially to this market. Currently, the market looks thriving and its future looks bright. However, it may face challenges in the years to come from the weakening of the economy in emerging regions, especially Africa, notes the research study. The study presented here is based on a report by Transparency Market Research (TMR), titled “Pharmerging Market (Product Type – Pharmaceuticals (Branded Prescription Drugs, Generic Drugs (Branded Generics, Unbranded Generics, and OTC Drugs) and Healthcare (Medical Devices, Diagnostic Instruments, and IT and Record Management); Economic Growth Levels – Tier – 1, Tier – 2, and Tier – 3; Indications – Lifestyle Diseases, Cancer and Autoimmune Diseases, and Infectious Diseases; Distribution Channel – Hospitals, Clinics, Retail Pharmacies, E-commerce, and Drug Stores) – Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecast 2016 – 2024.” About Us Transparency Market Research (TMR) is a global market intelligence company providing business information reports and services.

 The world’s largest health agency is asking big pharma to step up its donations for diseases that affect 1 billion people Stephanie Nebehay, Reuters Apr. 19, 2017, 9:28 AM 367 facebook linkedin twitter email print Bill Gates, co-founder of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, speaks during a news conference on Neglected Tropical Diseases in Geneva Thomson Reuters GENEVA (Reuters) - Progress has been made in tackling diseases that blind, disable and disfigure millions of poor in tropical areas each year, but drug companies need to step up donations of medicines, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday. One billion people, mainly in Asia, Africa and Latin America, are still treated each year for at least one of 18 neglected tropical diseases known as NTDs, it said. Dengue, onchocerciasis (river blindness), and sleeping sickness are among those carried by mosquitoes or flies that are spreading from rural areas to urban slums, the WHO warned. "There is no group of diseases that is so intimately linked to poverty," Dr. Dirk Engels, director of WHO's department of control of neglected tropic diseases, told a news briefing. "A number of companies have accompanied us in the scaling up by making more medicines available. Is that enough? No, there are still diseases that are neglected and we still have problems with access to basic medicines," he said. GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis and Sanofi are among major donors, WHO says. Merck said earlier it was developing a children's formula of its drug to treat schistosomiasis, a parasitic worm disease which kills 280,000 a year in Africa. New products need an access plan for patients "because just counting on the commercial mechanisms won’t work", Enders said. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is backing research and development into NTDs. Bill Gates met with CEOs of major pharmaceutical companies in Geneva on Tuesday. "Good progress, some of these diseases are on track to be done (eliminated) by 2020, some by 2025. Some will take longer than that," Gates told a news conference, noting that there were only 3,000 cases of sleeping sickness last year.  Expensive medicines Needs remain huge despite the fight over the past decade and a 2012 London meeting to galvanize attention and set targets, WHO said. "Cutaneous leishmaniasis, for instance. It doesn’t kill so it attracts less attention, but it is really disfiguring and it causes a lot of stigma and a lot of mental problems," Engels said of the disease spread by female sandflies. "The medicines exist...They are too expensive and (neither) people nor countries have the ability to pay." Drugs companies currently have 109 research and development projects for medicines or vaccines for NTDs, which typically take 10-15 years to develop, the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA) said. "There are quite a number of new medicines and diagnostics in the pipeline, which may actually further change the perspective for these neglected tropical diseases and hopefully allow us to go further towards eliminating or near eliminating these diseases by 2030," Enders said. Only 25 human cases of Guinea worm disease were reported last year, "putting eradication within reach", he added. "We have just acknowledged the first African country that has eliminated lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem – Togo – so that may be a start of a number of them," Enders said.

These activities, according to Persistence Market Research, will boost the overall status of the market in near future. – Merck & Co. and Johnson & Johnson are concentrating on new product development, such as nasal sprays. – Boehringer Ingelheim will continue to contribute a major share to the market through an increased focus on R&D and a strong distribution network. – Sanofi S.A. is also focusing more on increasing R&D investments directed to expanded sales. – In addition to growing R&D efforts, AstraZeneca is also emphasizing on innovation of technologically advanced products and acquisition of selective regional players. – GlaxoSmithKline PLC and Alcon (Novartis AG) are prioritising cost-effective product development for long-term profits; Alcon specifically aims to tap into emerging markets. – Acquisition of players from the same segment and different region will be a key strategy of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., which targets production capacity expansion. – By disease type, perennial AR segment will remain dominant with around 47% market value share in 2024, gaining around 123 BPS throughout the forecast period. On the other hand, despite losing over 30 BPS over 2016-2024, occupational AR will continue to be the second largest segment with over 35% revenue share at the end of the assessment period. While the revenues of the former are expected to surpass US$ 7.0 Bn, the latter will possibly exceed a value of US$ 5.0 Bn by the end of 2024. By treatment type, immunotherapy treatment segment is expected to be the fastest growing segment over the forecast owing to introduction of new immunotherapy based products, followed by antihistamines segment. However, antihistamines will continue to be the leading treatment type segment with over 50% share in 2024, followed by corticosteroids with over 31% share. Based on route of administration, oral route of administration segment will cover nearly half of the market in terms of value, whereas nasal route of administration segment is anticipated to capture around 38% share of the total market value in 2024. Intravenous segment is foreseen to witness a higher CAGR compared to others, which can uplift the sales revenues of this segment to cross US$ 1.25 Bn in 2024.

Central to AstraZeneca's case is a trial called MYSTIC which is testing the drugs durvalumab and tremelimumab in lung cancer. If initial results to be reported at mid-year indicate success, this could confirm the company's place at oncology's top table. But the market for medicines boosting the immune system's ability to fight tumours is increasingly competitive and the science is moving fast, raising questions as to whether AstraZeneca can produce a knock-out win. Merck & Co, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Roche already have similar drugs approved in lung cancer and the race is on to launch effective combinations for previously untreated disease in patients - a potentially huge market. "I think there will be multiple approvals in the first-line (untreated) space," Naiyer Rizvi, head of thoracic oncology at Columbia University Medical Center, told Reuters. "The question is going to be how do you position all these different options." Durvalumab and tremelimumab are immuno-oncology (I-O) drugs which, by helping the body's immune cells kill cancer, offer an alternative to toxic chemotherapy. While not without side effects, I-O is a kinder option that also promises longer-lasting efficacy, although the high cost is a concern. Analysts at Jefferies see a $20 billion opportunity for I-O drugs in first-line non-small cell lung cancer, with sales split between I-O monotherapy (administering one such medicine on its own); I-O plus conventional chemotherapy; and combinations of two I-O drugs, as in AstraZeneca's approach. "There's a critical unmet need, which is why there is so much excitement about immunotherapies and so much activity," said Rob Iannone, AstraZeneca's head of late-stage I-O development. "Current outcomes are still very, very poor." As experience builds with using the new agents, rival drugmakers have been busily amending clinical trial plans to keep up with a shifting landscape, while also launching new studies to exploit a coming second generation of I-O medicines. The issue has been further complicated by doubts over how to identify patients who will benefit. The latest data suggests that the level of mutation in tumours may be a better biomarker than the current widely used benchmark, a protein called PDL-1. "PDL-1 is a bit of a blunt instrument," said Rizvi. "In future, I think you will see a lot better science around identifying patients based on their genetics." BIG SHARE PRICE SWING AstraZeneca shares, which at around 46 pounds still trail the 55 pounds offered by Pfizer in 2014, are expected to move sharply up or down on the MYSTIC data. But the result may not be as clear-cut as some investors hope because the full data will emerge in stages. Headline news on progression-free survival (PFS), or extending the time before cancer worsens, is due in June or July, with details following later, possibly at the European Society for Medical Oncology congress in Madrid in September. Doctors, patients and investors may have to wait until 2018 to learn whether durvalumab and tremelimumab actually help patients live longer by extending overall survival (OS). Given the competitive landscape, the pressure is on to achieve both PFS and OS. "In the first-line setting, I think it is important to hit both," said Rizvi, who is principal investigator for the MYSTIC trial. Indeed, a miss on PFS could be enough to mark AstraZeneca as a likely loser in the multibillion-dollar I-O race, according to UBS analysts. AstraZeneca's Iannone sees it rather differently, arguing that the durable response generated by I-O drugs makes long-term survival, not PFS, the gold standard test. "It looks as if OS is a more robust endpoint," he said. "We want to preserve PFS, even if we know that the study might ultimately have to wait for OS to appreciate the full benefit." Importantly, AstraZeneca has built multiple options into its trial design, with potential to prove that durva/treme can help all patients or a subset with high levels of PDL-1. In addition, durvalumab is being tested on its own. Back in 2014, AstraZeneca predicted durvalumab could have peak sales of $6.5 billion, including combination therapies, making it the biggest contributor to revenue growth. Current analyst forecasts are only around half this level, according to Thomson Reuters data, making the next few weeks pivotal in building or eroding expectations. AstraZeneca has two chances to build confidence ahead of MYSTIC, with durvalumab potentially winning approval in bladder cancer - a relatively small market - and data also due from a lower-profile lung cancer trial called ARCTIC. But rivals are moving fast. Merck is expected to get a U.S. green light to sell a combination of its I-O drug Keytruda and chemotherapy in first-line lung cancer by May 10, while Bristol-Myers and Roche also have important upcoming combination data. All of this makes success critical for AstraZeneca, which is struggling with falling sales from loss of patents on blockbusters such as cholesterol drug Crestor and is doing external deals to help fund new-drug research. Pfizer may have left the stage but some analysts and bankers believe AstraZeneca could become a target again in any future wave of pharmaceutical industry consolidation.

If initial results to be reported at mid-year indicate success, this could confirm the company's place at oncology's top table. But the market for medicines boosting the immune system's ability to fight tumours is increasingly competitive and the science is moving fast, raising questions as to whether AstraZeneca can produce a knock-out win. Merck & Co, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Roche already have similar drugs approved in lung cancer and the race is on to launch effective combinations for previously untreated disease in patients - a potentially huge market. "I think there will be multiple approvals in the first-line (untreated) space," Naiyer Rizvi, head of thoracic oncology at Columbia University Medical Center, told Reuters. "The question is going to be how do you position all these different options." Durvalumab and tremelimumab are immuno-oncology (I-O) drugs which, by helping the body's immune cells kill cancer, offer an alternative to toxic chemotherapy. While not without side effects, I-O is a kinder option that also promises longer-lasting efficacy, although the high cost is a concern. Analysts at Jefferies see a $20 billion opportunity for I-O drugs in first-line non-small cell lung cancer, with sales split between I-O monotherapy (administering one such medicine on its own); I-O plus conventional chemotherapy; and combinations of two I-O drugs, as in AstraZeneca's approach. "There's a critical unmet need, which is why there is so much excitement about immunotherapies and so much activity," said Rob Iannone, AstraZeneca's head of late-stage I-O development. "Current outcomes are still very, very poor." As experience builds with using the new agents, rival drugmakers have been busily amending clinical trial plans to keep up with a shifting landscape, while also launching new studies to exploit a coming second generation of I-O medicines. The issue has been further complicated by doubts over how to identify patients who will benefit. The latest data suggests that the level of mutation in tumours may be a better biomarker than the current widely used benchmark, a protein called PDL-1. "PDL-1 is a bit of a blunt instrument," said Rizvi. "In future, I think you will see a lot better science around identifying patients based on their genetics." BIG SHARE PRICE SWING AstraZeneca shares, which at around 46 pounds still trail the 55 pounds offered by Pfizer in 2014, are expected to move sharply up or down on the MYSTIC data. But the result may not be as clear-cut as some investors hope because the full data will emerge in stages. Headline news on progression-free survival (PFS), or extending the time before cancer worsens, is due in June or July, with details following later, possibly at the European Society for Medical Oncology congress in Madrid in September. Doctors, patients and investors may have to wait until 2018 to learn whether durvalumab and tremelimumab actually help patients live longer by extending overall survival (OS). Given the competitive landscape, the pressure is on to achieve both PFS and OS. "In the first-line setting, I think it is important to hit both," said Rizvi, who is principal investigator for the MYSTIC trial. Indeed, a miss on PFS could be enough to mark AstraZeneca as a likely loser in the multibillion-dollar I-O race, according to UBS analysts. AstraZeneca's Iannone sees it rather differently, arguing that the durable response generated by I-O drugs makes long-term survival, not PFS, the gold standard test. "It looks as if OS is a more robust endpoint," he said. "We want to preserve PFS, even if we know that the study might ultimately have to wait for OS to appreciate the full benefit." Importantly, AstraZeneca has built multiple options into its trial design, with potential to prove that durva/treme can help all patients or a subset with high levels of PDL-1. In addition, durvalumab is being tested on its own. Back in 2014, AstraZeneca predicted durvalumab could have peak sales of $6.5 billion, including combination therapies, making it the biggest contributor to revenue growth. Current analyst forecasts are only around half this level, according to Thomson Reuters data, making the next few weeks pivotal in building or eroding expectations. AstraZeneca has two chances to build confidence ahead of MYSTIC, with durvalumab potentially winning approval in bladder cancer - a relatively small market - and data also due from a lower-profile lung cancer trial called ARCTIC. But rivals are moving fast. Merck is expected to get a U.S. green light to sell a combination of its I-O drug Keytruda and chemotherapy in first-line lung cancer by May 10, while Bristol-Myers and Roche also have important upcoming combination data. All of this makes success critical for AstraZeneca, which is struggling with falling sales from loss of patents on blockbusters such as cholesterol drug Crestor and is doing external deals to help fund new-drug research. Pfizer may have left the stage but some analysts and bankers believe AstraZeneca could become a target again in any future wave of pharmaceutical industry consolidation.

Startup Atomwise Has a Deal for Researchers Hunting for New Drugs Bernadette Tansey April 19th, 2017 @Tansey_Xconomy @xconomy Like Us Xconomy San Francisco —  Artificial intelligence company Atomwise is offering a shortcut for as many as 100 university scientists who are searching for new drugs to fight disease. The San Francisco-based startup, which uses deep learning algorithms to ferret out drug candidates by sifting through masses of data, wants to send each researcher 72 compounds that might work. Atomwise has two motives for launching its Artificial Intelligence Molecular Screen (AIMS) awards program. The first goal is to help scientists leap over a gap in government funding, which covers basic research on the molecular mechanisms behind illnesses, as well as clinical trials on experimental drugs, but doesn’t support the hunt for drugs to test, says former UC Berkeley researcher Han Lim, who manages academic partnerships for Atomwise. The second objective for Atomwise is to further field-test its AI-enhanced drug screening system, AtomNet, on a broader class of research projects on numerous diseases. “That could produce case studies that allow us to demonstrate what we can do,” Atomwise co-founder and chief operating officer Alexander Levy says. Levy co-founded the company in 2012 with former fellow researchers at the University of Toronto, a hotbed of AI innovation. Their idea was to apply the techniques of AI—already proven powerful in the analysis of images and speech—to the complex mysteries of chemistry and biology. Atomwise was a 2015 participant in Y Combinator’s accelerator program and raised $6 million in seed funding that year. It has collaborated with 27 research institutions and companies, including Stanford University, IBM, and Merck. About 14 of those projects are still ongoing, and the company is earning revenues, Levy says. Atomwise’s virtual drug screening system is part of a long-running drive to find quicker ways to identify compounds that could block off-kilter processes on the molecular level that lead to illness. Researchers looking for the causes behind a disease often have strong suspects in mind. The culprits are usually biologically active proteins in the body that are knocking essential functions out of whack. While discovering a disease’s molecular cause does reveal it as a possible target for therapeutic drugs, that’s only part of the path toward a medical treatment. Scientists still need to identify compounds that might counteract the malign effects of the suspect protein. Finding those drug candidates is one of the most challenging tasks in medical research. The compounds most likely to succeed are those that will bind with the target molecule. In the first attempts at automated mass drug screening, companies such as Exelixis did physical binding tests by exposing millions of compounds to the target. Such empirical studies are now part of the mass of data that AI companies such as Atomwise and Numerate—along with big players like IBM and Google—can rifle through with deep learning software. Levy says the inputs for Atomwise’s analysis include chemical descriptions of the small molecule compounds it evaluates as drugs, and X-ray crystallography images of the target proteins—which can reveal their structure and possible binding sites. Atomwise also scans data on the known interactions between small molecules and targets. Atomwise is inviting university researchers to send in a short application for the AIMS program by June 12, stating the disease they’re working on, their target molecule, and any particular requirements for their drug candidate. For example, if the drug must reach a target molecule in the brain, it would need to be able to cross the blood-brain barrier. Atomwise will study the feasibility of each applicant’s project, and notify those chosen for the program in September. Levy says Atomwise might screen as many as 10 million molecules to find the six dozen best compounds for a single scientist’s needs. Lim and Levy acknowledge that some scientists might be reluctant to reveal the target molecule they think is causing a disease, if that causal link is an original discovery that might become extremely valuable if it leads to lucrative drugs. It’s up to the scientists to decide whether to identify their targets, Lim and Levy say, but … Next Page » Single PageCurrently on Page: 1 2 Bernadette Tansey is Xconomy's San Francisco Editor.

Central to AstraZeneca's case is a trial called MYSTIC which is testing the drugs durvalumab and tremelimumab in lung cancer. If initial results to be reported at mid-year indicate success, this could confirm the company's place at oncology's top table. But the market for medicines boosting the immune system's ability to fight tumours is increasingly competitive and the science is moving fast, raising questions as to whether AstraZeneca can produce a knock-out win. Merck &amp; Co, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Roche already have similar drugs approved in lung cancer and the race is on to launch effective combinations for previously untreated disease in patients - a potentially huge market. "I think there will be multiple approvals in the first-line (untreated) space," Naiyer Rizvi, head of thoracic oncology at Columbia University Medical Center, told Reuters. "The question is going to be how do you position all these different options." Durvalumab and tremelimumab are immuno-oncology (I-O) drugs which, by helping the body's immune cells kill cancer, offer an alternative to toxic chemotherapy. While not without side effects, I-O is a kinder option that also promises longer-lasting efficacy, although the high cost is a concern. Analysts at Jefferies see a $20 billion opportunity for I-O drugs in first-line non-small cell lung cancer, with sales split between I-O monotherapy (administering one such medicine on its own); I-O plus conventional chemotherapy; and combinations of two I-O drugs, as in AstraZeneca's approach. "There's a critical unmet need, which is why there is so much excitement about immunotherapies and so much activity," said Rob Iannone, AstraZeneca's head of late-stage I-O development. "Current outcomes are still very, very poor." As experience builds with using the new agents, rival drugmakers have been busily amending clinical trial plans to keep up with a shifting landscape, while also launching new studies to exploit a coming second generation of I-O medicines. The issue has been further complicated by doubts over how to identify patients who will benefit. The latest data suggests that the level of mutation in tumours may be a better biomarker than the current widely used benchmark, a protein called PDL-1. "PDL-1 is a bit of a blunt instrument," said Rizvi. "In future, I think you will see a lot better science around identifying patients based on their genetics." BIG SHARE PRICE SWING AstraZeneca shares, which at around 46 pounds still trail the 55 pounds offered by Pfizer in 2014, are expected to move sharply up or down on the MYSTIC data. But the result may not be as clear-cut as some investors hope because the full data will emerge in stages. Headline news on progression-free survival (PFS), or extending the time before cancer worsens, is due in June or July, with details following later, possibly at the European Society for Medical Oncology congress in Madrid in September. Doctors, patients and investors may have to wait until 2018 to learn whether durvalumab and tremelimumab actually help patients live longer by extending overall survival (OS). Given the competitive landscape, the pressure is on to achieve both PFS and OS. "In the first-line setting, I think it is important to hit both," said Rizvi, who is principal investigator for the MYSTIC trial. Indeed, a miss on PFS could be enough to mark AstraZeneca as a likely loser in the multibillion-dollar I-O race, according to UBS analysts. AstraZeneca's Iannone sees it rather differently, arguing that the durable response generated by I-O drugs makes long-term survival, not PFS, the gold standard test. "It looks as if OS is a more robust endpoint," he said. "We want to preserve PFS, even if we know that the study might ultimately have to wait for OS to appreciate the full benefit." Importantly, AstraZeneca has built multiple options into its trial design, with potential to prove that durva/treme can help all patients or a subset with high levels of PDL-1. In addition, durvalumab is being tested on its own. Back in 2014, AstraZeneca predicted durvalumab could have peak sales of $6.5 billion, including combination therapies, making it the biggest contributor to revenue growth. Current analyst forecasts are only around half this level, according to Thomson Reuters data, making the next few weeks pivotal in building or eroding expectations. AstraZeneca has two chances to build confidence ahead of MYSTIC, with durvalumab potentially winning approval in bladder cancer - a relatively small market - and data also due from a lower-profile lung cancer trial called ARCTIC. But rivals are moving fast. Merck is expected to get a U.S. green light to sell a combination of its I-O drug Keytruda and chemotherapy in first-line lung cancer by May 10, while Bristol-Myers and Roche also have important upcoming combination data. All of this makes success critical for AstraZeneca, which is struggling with falling sales from loss of patents on blockbusters such as cholesterol drug Crestor and is doing external deals to help fund new-drug research. Pfizer may have left the stage but some analysts and bankers believe AstraZeneca could become a target again in any future wave of pharmaceutical industry consolidation.

Scroll Staff Published Yesterday · 05:45 pm.   Ala'a Najjar/Wikimedia Commons [Licenced under CC BY 4.0] Yesterday · 05:45 pm.   Scroll Staff Share Tweet Email Reddit Print Share Tweet Email Reddit Print Dracunculiasis, onchocerciasis, echinococcosis, schistosomiasis – these almost unpronounceable words are names of neglected tropical diseases that affect billions of people. A global collaboration headed by the World Health Organisation has been working for the last 10 years to control these diseases. One billion people were treated for at least one neglected tropical disease in 2015 alone, the World Health Organisation reported on Wednesday. The organisation is calling the progress over the last 10 years towards eliminating these diseases “record-breaking”. Neglected tropical diseases are a group of communicable diseases that are found tropical and subtropical regions across 149. These diseases affect more than one billion people, mainly those living in poverty, and cost developing economies billions of dollars every year. Neglected tropical diseases found in India include dengue, rabies, leprosy, kala azar and filariasis. Large populations across Africa are also affected by neglected tropical diseases. Play While celebrating 10 years of a global collaboration against neglected tropical diseases, the WHO noted its achievements. For instance, only 25 human cases of guinea-worm disease were recorded in 2016, putting eradication of the disease within reach. More than 114 million people received treatment for onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness. Cases of sleeping sickness or African trypanosomiasis have been reduced from 37,000 new cases in 1999 to less than 3,000 cases in 2015. In India, visceral leishmaniasis or kala azar was eliminated in 82% of the sub-districts where the disease was endemic. This video, partly funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that supports the WHO’s programme against neglected tropical diseases, why these diseases are neglected and the sustained efforts needed to eliminate them. Play Much of the success in controlling the diseases has been attributed to mass drug distribution with donations of free medicines from pharmaceutical companies. In fact, nine drug companies including Merck, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis and Sanofi have pledged to continue to donate drugs and treatments till the WHO’s elimination targets are met.

After catching up on email, she connects with her colleagues to discuss, exchange notes and crunch numbers coming in from across India and the world. Shreya who works out of the café most of the time, is employed with an MNC and is a ‘remote worker’. At her company headquarters, there are many who defy the stereotype of a big company workforce - the marketing professional who by necessity is a ‘meeting-hopper’ on the office campus or those who have no fixed desks and are often found hobnobbing with their colleagues in the corridors for work. There are also the typical deskbound knowledge workers. These represent a new breed of professionals in India. Gone are the days when an employee was bound to a desk and the timings of the workplace – the new set of professionals thrive on flexibility which leads to better creativity and productivity as well as work-life balance. There is one common thread to all of them – technology, tailored to their work styles, which delivers on speed and ease of interactions. Several influential industry studies and economists have predicted that digital technologies have been as impactful as the Industrial Revolution in shaping the way people work. India is at the forefront of this change because of the lack of legacy barriers, a fast-growing economy and young workers. Five factors are enabling the birth of this new workforce: Smart is the way forward According to the Future Workforce Study conducted by Dell, three in five working Indians surveyed said that they were likely to quit their job if their work technology did not meet their standards. Everyone knows the frustration caused by slow or broken technology – in fact 41% of the working Indians surveyed identified this as the biggest waste of time at work. A ‘Smart workplace’ translates into fast, efficient and anytime-anywhere access to data, applications and other resources. Technology adoption is thus a major factor in an employee’s choice of place of work. Openness to new technologies While young professionals want their companies to get the basics right, they are also open to new technologies like Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality and Artificial Intelligence. The Dell study clearly reflects this trend — 93% of Indians surveyed are willing to use Augmented/Virtual Reality at work and 90% say Artificial Intelligence would make their jobs easier. The use of these technologies is no longer just a novelty project at firms. For example, ThysenKrupp, the elevator manufacturer uses VR to help its maintenance technician visualize an elevator repair job before he reaches the site. In India, startups such as vPhrase and Fluid AI are evolving AI solutions in the field of data processing and predictive analysis. Desire for flexibility  A majority of Indians surveyed rate freedom to bring their own devices (laptops, tablets, smartphones etc.) to work very highly. This should not be surprising, personal devices are usually highly customized to an individual’s requirements and help increase their productivity. For example, some may prefer a high-performance system while others may prioritize portability over anything else. Half the working Indians surveyed also feel that the flexibility of work location enhances productivity and enables better work-life balance. Work-life balance is fast emerging as one of the top drivers of workplace happiness for employees and initiatives aimed at it are finding their way to the priority list of business leaders. Maintaining close collaboration  While flexible working is here to stay, there is great value in collaborating in person in the office. When people work face to face, they can pick up verbal and body language cues, respond to each other better and build connections. Thus, companies are trying to implement technology that boosts seamless collaboration, even when teams are working remotely. Work place collaboration tools like Slack and Trello help employees keep in touch and manage projects from different locations. The usage of Skype has also become common. Companies like Dell are also working on hi-tech tools such as devices which boost connectivity in the most remote locations and responsive videos screens which make people across geographies feel like they are interacting face to face. Rise of Data Security  All these trends involve a massive amount of data being stored and exchanged online. With this comes the inevitable anxiety around data security. Apart from more data being online, security threats have also evolved to become sophisticated cyber-attacks which traditional security systems cannot handle. The Dell study shows that about 74% of those surveyed ranked data security measures as their number one priority. This level of concern about data security has made the new Indian workforce very willing to consider new solutions such as biometric authentication and advanced encryption in work systems. Technology is at the core of change, whether in the context of an enterprise as a whole, the workforce or the individual employee. Dell, in their study of working professionals, identified five distinct personas — the Remote Workers, the On-The-Go Workers, the Desk-centric Workers, the Corridor Warriors and the Specialized Workers. Dell has developed a range of laptops in the Dell Latitude series to suit each of these personas and match their requirements in terms of ease, speed and power.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Eisai Announces Continued Support of Initiatives for the Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis 5-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF LONDON DECLARATION ON NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES WOODCLIFF LAKE, N.J., April 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Eisai Inc. announced today that its parent company Tokyo, Japan-based Eisai Co., Ltd. has pledged the continuing support of its initiatives for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis (LF), a parasitic disease that is transmitted to humans by the bite of a mosquito. This announcement was made at an event held in Geneva, Switzerland, on April 18, marking the 5th anniversary of the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs), an international public-private partnership. Under the London Declaration, Eisai signed an agreement with the World Health Organization (WHO) to supply 2.2 billion high-quality diethylcarbamazine (DEC) tablets for the treatment of LF, which were running in short supply worldwide, at Price Zero (free of charge) by the year 2020. As of the end of March 2017, 1 billion tablets, which were manufactured at Eisai's Vizag Plant in India, have been supplied to 27 countries. In addition to the supply of DEC tablets, local Eisai employees in LF endemic countries have been cooperating with WHO, local governments, and non-governmental organization (NGO) partners to support local elimination efforts, through Mass Drug Administrations (MDA), disease awareness campaigns, improvements in sanitation, and other activities. Furthermore, Eisai has collaborated with other pharmaceutical companies, WHO, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to develop and freely provide new, low-cost diagnostic kits for LF, which do not require a temperature-controlled supply chain. "Eisai is proud to be one of the member companies that signed the London Declaration," said Haruo Naito, CEO, Eisai Co., Ltd. "Working together, with industry, government and NGO partners over the last five years, we have made tremendous progress towards our goal of eliminating devastating and horrific NTDs. The impact that these efforts have had on thousands of patients in need affects not only their health, but also the prosperity of the entire community and future development in these areas." Announced in January 2012, the London Declaration is the largest public-private partnership in the field of global health, and represents a coordinated effort by global pharmaceutical companies, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, WHO, the United States, United Kingdom and NTD-endemic country governments, as well as other partners, to eliminate 10 NTDs by the year 2020. Since the signing of the London Declaration, donations of medical treatments by pharmaceutical companies have increased by 70 percent, and these treatments contribute to the prevention and cure of disease in approximately 1 billion people every year. As a result of these activities under the London Declaration, a total of eight out of 73 endemic countries have eliminated LF as a public health threat, with another 10 currently waiting on results to verify elimination. Eisai will continue to supply DEC tablets to the endemic countries that need them beyond 2020, as well as promote comprehensive support activities so that even more countries can achieve elimination by 2020. Eisai seeks to contribute to the health and welfare of people in developing and emerging countries, as it considers this to be a long-term investment in creating the markets of the future. Once they have recovered their health, they can resume productive activities, which will in turn contribute to economic development and expansion of the middle-income class. In addition to supplying DEC tablets free of charge, Eisai is also actively engaged in partnerships with governments, international organizations, academia, and NGOs to develop new drugs for NTDs, tuberculosis and malaria. Through these initiatives, Eisai seeks to make further contributions to patients and their families worldwide and increase the benefits that health care provides them. [Notes to editors] 1.     About Neglected Tropic Diseases (NTDs) According to the World Health Organization (WHO), NTDs blight the lives of more than 1 billion people in 149 countries, the majority of which are living in poverty.1 These diseases not only survive and spread in conditions of poverty but are also a cause of poverty in many countries and regions. Neglected tropical diseases can cause blindness and deform in ways that hinder economic productivity and prevent a normal social life. In serious cases, they may lead to death. The consequences are costly for societies and for health care. The following 18 NTDs have been designated by WHO for control or elimination: dengue / severe dengue, rabies, trachoma, buruli ulcer, yaws [endemic treponematoses], leprosy, Chagas disease, human African trypanosomiasis [sleeping sickness], the leishmaniases, cysticercosis / teniasis, dracunculiasis [guinea-worm disease], echinococcosis, food-borne trematodiases [fascioliasis], lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis [river blindness], schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminthiases, and mycetoma. 1 http://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/diseases/en/ 2.     About London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases On January 30, 2012, the CEOs of 13 global pharmaceutical companies*1, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the U.K. Department For International Development (DFID), the World Bank, and officials from NTD-endemic countries gathered in London to pledge their support for a coordinated effort to combat 10 Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs)*2 over the next ten years. The London Declaration represents the largest international public-private partnership to date, and unlike past approaches undertaken by an individual organization or for a single disease, the group has committed itself to working collaboratively in an effort to comprehensively tackle issues pertaining to drug supply, distribution, development, and implementation programs as it seeks to more effectively combat NTDs. *1 Abbvie, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eisai, GlaxoSmithKline, Gilead, Johnson & Johnson, Merck (Merck KGaA: Germany), Merck Sharp & Dhome, Novartis, Pfizer, Sanofi *2 Guinea worm, lymphatic filariasis, blinding trachoma, sleeping sickness, leprosy, soil-transmitted helminthes, schistosomiasis, river blindness, Chagas, and visceral leishmaniasis 3.     About lymphatic filariasis Lymphatic filariasis is a parasitic disease that is transmitted to humans by the bite of a mosquito. Once transmitted, it causes lymphatic dysfunction. While infection is usually acquired during childhood, symptoms gradually appear over several years, with the most serious manifestations of the disease occurring in adulthood. The most serious manifestation, known as elephantiasis, is a permanent physical disability in which a patient's lower extremities swell to resemble those of an elephant. In addition to impacting a patient's ability to perform everyday tasks, it has historically led to many patients falling victim to social persecution due to biases against the disease. The disease also causes patients and their families much emotional distress. The disease has been proven to have existed in Japan since the Heian Period (794-1184). However, Japan succeeded in eliminating lymphatic filariasis in the late 1970s as a result of initiatives carried out by a government-lead public-private partnership, becoming the first country in the world to demonstrate the successful achievement of lymphatic filariasis elimination using DEC. 4.     About Eisai's initiatives for developing new drugs for NTDs Eisai is currently promoting various projects aimed at developing new treatments for Chagas disease, filariasis, leishimaniasis and mycetoma as well as malaria and tuberculosis. For this R&D, Eisai is engaging in collaborations, such as partnerships with governments, international organizations, and NGOs. For example: Eisai is aiming to develop a new treatment for Chagas disease (a disease spread by the assassin bug that is endemic in 21 countries in Latin America). To this purpose, we are currently conducting a Phase II trial of our in-house developed anti-fungal agent fosravuconazole in partnership with Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi). Phase II clinical trials in collaboration with DNDi for the treatment of mycetoma (a disease which causes massive tumour-like lesions and is caused by fungal penetration of the skin) are also underway. In addition, Eisai co-established the Tuberculosis Drug Accelerator (TBDA) together with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and several other global pharmaceutical companies and research organizations, with the aim of discovering innovative new treatments for tuberculosis. Furthermore, Eisai is participating in several exploratory research consortiums such as the Macrofilaricide Drug Accelerator (MacDA), for developing macrofilaricidal drugs to combat filarial diseases, and the NTD Drug Discovery Booster, for more efficient development of drugs for leishmaniasis and Chagas disease, with the aim of fulfilling the high unmet needs of patients suffering from these diseases. 5.     About the Global Health Innovative Technology Fund The Global Health Innovative Technology Fund (GHIT Fund) is a Japanese public-private partnership, co-established by a consortium of pharmaceutical companies (including Eisai), the Japanese government and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The GHIT Fund promotes new drug discovery for treatment of NTDs in emerging and developing countries. Eisai Inc. At Eisai Inc., human health care (hhc) is our goal.

The US regulator has given the go-ahead to Tecentriq (atezolizumab) for use in locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) patients who are not eligible for cisplatin chemotherapy, based on the results of the mid-stage IMvigor210 study. Last year the FDA granted conditional approval to Tecentriq or mUC patients whose disease has progressed during or after platinum-based chemotherapy. The new OK is a stepwise increase in the number of bladder cancer patients eligible for treatment with Tecentriq and keeps the product's nose ahead of rival checkpoint inhibitors from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck & Co, which both reached the market ahead of Roche's drug for other cancer indications. Tecentriq had a few months as the only immuno-oncology drug available for bladder cancer but BMS claimed a second-line approval in mUC for its Opdivo (nivolumab) drug from the FDA in February, while Merck's Keytruda (pembrolizumab) has been filed for approval in first-line platinum-ineligible mUC patients as well as second-line after chemotherapy. Roche is going all out to try to maintain its lead in the fifth most common form of cancer and is also conducting a phase III trial (IMvigor211) comparing the drug directly to first-line chemotherapy in mUC. Results from that trial are due in November and if positive Tecentriq could become an option for most first-line patients. Bladder cancer affects almost 400,000 people a year and kills around 150,000 but has proved to be remarkably resistant to new drug therapy. Prior to the advent of immuno-oncology drugs, there had been no new treatments for patients with metastatic bladder cancer whose disease progressed despite platinum-based chemotherapy for 30 years. Meanwhile Tecentriq has also started to muscle into territory held by Opdivo and Keytruda, getting an FDA approval last October in second-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The reality is that in time the three drugs - along with newer entrants such as Merck KGaA and Pfizer's Bavencio (avelumab) - will be competing across multiple indications for a share of a market predicted to reach at tens of billions of dollars in the coming years.

One billion people, mainly in Asia, Africa and Latin America, are still treated each year for at least one of 18 neglected tropical diseases known as NTDs, it said. Dengue, onchocerciasis (river blindness), and sleeping sickness are among those carried by mosquitoes or flies that are spreading from rural areas to urban slums, the WHO warned. "There is no group of diseases that is so intimately linked to poverty," Dr. Dirk Engels, director of WHO's department of control of neglected tropic diseases, told a news briefing. "A number of companies have accompanied us in the scaling up by making more medicines available. Is that enough? No, there are still diseases that are neglected and we still have problems with access to basic medicines," he said. GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis and Sanofi are among major donors, WHO says. Merck said earlier it was developing a children's formula of its drug to treat schistosomiasis, a parasitic worm disease which kills 280,000 a year in Africa. New products need an access plan for patients "because just counting on the commercial mechanisms won't work", Enders said. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is backing research and development into NTDs. Bill Gates met with CEOs of major pharmaceutical companies in Geneva on Tuesday. "Good progress, some of these diseases are on track to be done (eliminated) by 2020, some by 2025. Some will take longer than that," Gates told a news conference, noting that there were only 3,000 cases of sleeping sickness last year. EXPENSIVE MEDICINES Needs remain huge despite the fight over the past decade and a 2012 London meeting to galvanise attention and set targets, WHO said. "Cutaneous leishmaniasis, for instance. It doesn't kill so it attracts less attention, but it is really disfiguring and it causes a lot of stigma and a lot of mental problems," Engels said of the disease spread by female sandflies. "The medicines exist...They are too expensive and (neither) people nor countries have the ability to pay." Drugs companies currently have 109 research and development projects for medicines or vaccines for NTDs, which typically take 10-15 years to develop, the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA) said. "There are quite a number of new medicines and diagnostics in the pipeline, which may actually further change the perspective for these neglected tropical diseases and hopefully allow us to go further towards eliminating or near eliminating these diseases by 2030," Enders said. Only 25 human cases of Guinea worm disease were reported last year, "putting eradication within reach", he added. "We have just acknowledged the first African country that has eliminated lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem – Togo – so that may be a start of a number of them," Enders said. The mosquito-borne infection, also known as elephantiasis, causes enlargement of limbs and genitals from adult worms in the lymphatic system.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 April 2017 by Monika Donimirska Controlled-Release Drug Delivery Technology Market 2017-2027 by Segmentation: Based on Product, Application and Region Specific focus on the quality-by-design (QbD) approaches for the robust design of dosage forms is expected to change the future landscape of controlled-release drug delivery technologies.  While conventional hydrophilic matrix based technologies such as Accuform are being used in the market for several years, recent advancements in the development of oral drug delivery systems such as gastro-retentive drug delivery for controlled release, buoyant systems, mucoadhesive systems for regulated release of anti-viral medications etc. would increase the penetration of controlled-release drug delivery technologies in the global pharmaceuticals market. Acuform polymer-based patented technology is widely being used in a number of controlled-release formulations such as NUCYNTA ER, Gralise (Depomed Inc.), Janumet XR (Merck), Glumetza (Salix Pharmaceuticals) etc. Wurster coating technology is being used in the drug coating for controlled release of drug since 1976. Corplex transdermal technology has largely been commercialized in P&G’s Crest product line. Plenty of new controlled-release technologies are in phase to be commercialized in next few years. For instance, MicroCor PTH using MicroCor transdermal technology is being evaluated in phase IIa.  OROS technology which delivers drug in controlled manneris being used in more than 17 commercially available drugs. In case of oral controlled drug delivery, elderly persons and pediatrics constitute the large proportion of consumers for controlled-release drugs due to increase adherence to dosage regime. Some of the commercially available medications using controlled-release drug delivery technology include Prozac (polymer matrix based system), Avinza (polymer coating), Capoten (enzyme activated system), GLUCOPHAGE XR (polymer matrix based system), Alza (osmotically activated system) etc. Controlled-Release Drug Delivery Technology Market: Drivers and Restraints The global market for controlled-release drug delivery technology is driven by increasing the need for pediatric controlled release dosage forms, high acceptance of CR dosage forms due to once-a-daily dosing nature, etc. However, some of the major factors restraining the global market for controlled-release drug delivery technology are fewer excipients are deemed acceptable for pediatric use, the requirement of a high dose of API, promising development of CR dosage forms that impart abuse resistance, a higher price of controlled-release systems compared with traditional pharmaceutical formulations, etc. Moreover, some of the biopharmaceutical challenges for development of controlled-release drug delivery systems such as establishing desired release profiles for new chemical entities, risk management of dose dumping, selection of biocompatible and biodegradable materials with desired controlled-release properties, etc. Request For Report Sample@  http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-gb-2833 Controlled-Release Drug Delivery Technology Market: Segmentation The global controlled-release drug delivery technology market has been segmented on the basis of technology, release mechanism, application, and geography.

REUTERS/Pierre Albouy 3/3 By Stephanie Nebehay | GENEVA GENEVA Progress has been made in tackling diseases that blind, disable and disfigure millions of poor in tropical areas each year, but drug companies need to step up donations of medicines, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday. One billion people, mainly in Asia, Africa and Latin America, are still treated each year for at least one of 18 neglected tropical diseases known as NTDs, it said. Dengue, onchocerciasis (river blindness), and sleeping sickness are among those carried by mosquitoes or flies that are spreading from rural areas to urban slums, the WHO warned. "There is no group of diseases that is so intimately linked to poverty," Dr. Dirk Engels, director of WHO's department of control of neglected tropic diseases, told a news briefing. "A number of companies have accompanied us in the scaling up by making more medicines available. Is that enough? No, there are still diseases that are neglected and we still have problems with access to basic medicines," he said. GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis and Sanofi are among major donors, WHO says. Merck said earlier it was developing a children's formula of its drug to treat schistosomiasis, a parasitic worm disease which kills 280,000 a year in Africa. New products need an access plan for patients "because just counting on the commercial mechanisms won’t work", Enders said. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is backing research and development into NTDs. Bill Gates met with CEOs of major pharmaceutical companies in Geneva on Tuesday. "Good progress, some of these diseases are on track to be done (eliminated) by 2020, some by 2025. Some will take longer than that," Gates told a news conference, noting that there were only 3,000 cases of sleeping sickness last year. EXPENSIVE MEDICINES Needs remain huge despite the fight over the past decade and a 2012 London meeting to galvanise attention and set targets, WHO said. "Cutaneous leishmaniasis, for instance. It doesn’t kill so it attracts less attention, but it is really disfiguring and it causes a lot of stigma and a lot of mental problems," Engels said of the disease spread by female sandflies. "The medicines exist...They are too expensive and (neither) people nor countries have the ability to pay." Drugs companies currently have 109 research and development projects for medicines or vaccines for NTDs, which typically take 10-15 years to develop, the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA) said. "There are quite a number of new medicines and diagnostics in the pipeline, which may actually further change the perspective for these neglected tropical diseases and hopefully allow us to go further towards eliminating or near eliminating these diseases by 2030," Enders said. Only 25 human cases of Guinea worm disease were reported last year, "putting eradication within reach", he added. "We have just acknowledged the first African country that has eliminated lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem – Togo – so that may be a start of a number of them," Enders said. The mosquito-borne infection, also known as elephantiasis, causes enlargement of limbs and genitals from adult worms in the lymphatic system.

Veeva Vault SiteExchange will improve efficiencies and allow clinical trial investigators, sites, and participating sponsors to have immediate and centralized access to critical documents, eliminating one of the burdens that exists at investigator sites. “Veeva is a proven technology innovator and cloud leader with an excellent track record in driving greater efficiency in clinical operations,” said Janice Chang, senior vice president of global operations at TransCelerate. “The integration of Veeva Vault SiteExchange with the Shared Investigator Platform further simplifies site administrative efforts, which is core to one of our strategic priorities to improve site experience.” “TransCelerate is doing exciting work to promote enhanced industry collaboration and introduce efficient ways companies can accelerate treatments to market,” said Jennifer Goldsmith, senior vice president of Veeva Vault strategy. “We’re honored to work with TransCelerate and help clinical sites and sponsors effectively manage trial documentation to get medicine to patients more quickly.” Veeva Vault SiteExchange is a cloud application that will help sites consolidate study document requests, alerts, and notifications across sponsors in the TransCelerate-sponsored SIP. Now investigators can spend less time on administrative tasks and focus more on clinical research.

REUTERS/Pierre Albouy Enlarge Caption  Email More A A GENEVA: The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Western countries and drug companies pledged fresh support on Wednesday to wipe out diseases that blind, disable and disfigure millions of poor in tropical areas each year and urged new donors to join the fight. Some 1.5 billion people, mainly in Asia, Africa and Latin America, are infected with one of 18 neglected tropical diseases known as NTDs, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said. One billion of them are receiving treatment, half of them children. "The best thing with these diseases is not to debate whether they are neglected or not, but to proceed to make them history," Bill Gates told a global partners' meeting held at WHO. "We need a broader, deeper bench of investors... so that by 2030 we can achieve the goal of reaching 90 percent of the people who need treatment. I know this is achievable." Gates, who has supported the initiative for over a decade with US$1 billion, pledged US$335 million over the next 4 years, including US$42 million to continue efforts to wipe out Guinea-worm disease. The crippling disease, transmitted by contaminated water, can lead to a 100 cm long (40-inch) worm growing in the body. "Guinea worm is one of our great success stories, even though we're not absolutely at zero, we are down to very small numbers. Thirty years ago over 3 million people in over 20 countries were afflicted," Gates said. Only 25 cases of Guinea-worm disease were reported in six countries last year, "putting eradication within reach", the WHO says. The Carter Center, set up by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, has worked for more than 20 years to wipe it out. "We are close to finishing off this debilitating disease," Carter said, speaking by video from Atlanta, Georgia. "We cannot be complacent, we must be creative and persistent. The Carter Center will not give up until the last Guinea worm is gone." Dengue, onchocerciasis (river blindness), and sleeping sickness are among those carried by mosquitoes or flies that are spreading from rural areas to urban slums, the WHO warned. "NTDs are really the diseases of neglected people, they are diseases of poverty and inequality that affect the most vulnerable among us," World Bank President Jim Kim said by video. "Now we have the largest drug donation program in history with 1.5 billion treatments in 2015 alone," he said. GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis and Sanofi are among major donors, WHO says. Merck said on Tuesday it was developing a children's formula of its drug to treat schistosomiasis, a parasitic worm disease which kills 280,000 a year in Africa. Britain's Minister of State for International Development, Lord Bates, said the UK government was committing an additional 250 million pounds (US$321.35 million) to NTD programs. Belgium's deputy prime minister Alexander de Croo pledged 25 million euros (US$26.81 million) through 2025 to eradicate African sleeping sickness. "Today the stars are aligned to eradicate it completely," de Croo told the talks. "The pay-off is huge".

"The best thing with these diseases is not to debate whether they are neglected or not, but to proceed to make them history," Bill Gates told a global partners' meeting held at WHO. "We need a broader, deeper bench of investors... so that by 2030 we can achieve the goal of reaching 90 percent of the people who need treatment. I know this is achievable." Gates, who has supported the initiative for over a decade with $1 billion, pledged $335 million over the next 4 years, including $42 million to continue efforts to wipe out Guinea-worm disease. The crippling disease, transmitted by contaminated water, can lead to a 100 cm long (40-inch) worm growing in the body. "Guinea worm is one of our great success stories, even though we're not absolutely at zero, we are down to very small numbers. Thirty years ago over 3 million people in over 20 countries were afflicted," Gates said. Only 25 cases of Guinea-worm disease were reported in six countries last year, "putting eradication within reach", the WHO says. The Carter Center, set up by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, has worked for more than 20 years to wipe it out. "We are close to finishing off this debilitating disease," Carter said, speaking by video from Atlanta, Georgia. "We cannot be complacent, we must be creative and persistent. The Carter Center will not give up until the last Guinea worm is gone." Dengue, onchocerciasis (river blindness), and sleeping sickness are among those carried by mosquitoes or flies that are spreading from rural areas to urban slums, the WHO warned. "NTDs are really the diseases of neglected people, they are diseases of poverty and inequality that affect the most vulnerable among us," World Bank President Jim Kim said by video. "Now we have the largest drug donation program in history with 1.5 billion treatments in 2015 alone," he said. GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis and Sanofi are among major donors, WHO says. Merck said on Tuesday it was developing a children's formula of its drug to treat schistosomiasis, a parasitic worm disease which kills 280,000 a year in Africa. Britain's Minister of State for International Development, Lord Bates, said the UK government was committing an additional 250 million pounds ($321.35 million) to NTD programs. Belgium's deputy prime minister Alexander de Croo pledged 25 million euros ($26.81 million) through 2025 to eradicate African sleeping sickness. "Today the stars are aligned to eradicate it completely," de Croo told the talks. "The pay-off is huge".

The summit coincided with the launch of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Fourth Report on NTDs, showing By Maxwell Awumah, GNA Geneva, April 19, GNA - Leaders from governments, pharmaceutical companies and charitable organizations have congregated at a five-day summit in Geneva to pledge new commitments to the collective effort to control and eliminate Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). The summit coincided with the launch of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Fourth Report on NTDs, showing transformational progress against these debilitating diseases, and a commitment by the United Kingdom to more than double its funding for NTDs. The meeting comes five years after the launch of the London Declaration on NTDs, a commitment by the public and private sectors to achieve the WHO goals for the control, elimination and eradication of 10 NTDs. Currently, billions worth of treatments have been donated by pharmaceutical companies and delivered to impoverished communities in nearly 150 countries, reaching nearly a billion people in 2015. NTDs are some of the oldest and most painful diseases, afflicting the world’s poorest communities. One in six people suffer from NTDs worldwide, including more than half a billion children. NTDs disable, debilitate and perpetuate cycles of poverty, keeping children out of school, parents out of work, and dampening hope of any chance of an economic future. New Report Shows Dramatic Progress A new report titled Integrating Neglected Tropical Diseases in Global Health and Development by the WHO revealed that more people are being reached with the needed NTD interventions than ever before. In 2015, nearly a billion people received treatments donated by pharmaceutical companies for at least one NTD, representing a 36 percent increase since 2011, the year before the launch of the London Declaration. As more districts, countries and regions eliminate NTDs, the number of people requiring treatments has decreased from 2 billion in 2010 to 1.6 billion in 2015. “WHO has observed record-breaking progress towards bringing ancient scourges like sleeping sickness and elephantiasis to their knees,” says WHO Director-General, Dr Margaret Chan. “Over the past 10 years, millions of people have been rescued from disability and poverty, thanks to one of the most effective global partnerships in modern public health.” The report detailed progress against each disease, citing countries and regions that are reaching the control and elimination goals for specific NTDs. Highlights include: Lymphatic Filariasis (LF): In the last year, eight countries (Cambodia, Cook Islands, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Niue, Sri Lanka, Togo and Vanuatu) eliminated LF, and 10 other countries are waiting on surveillance results to verify elimination. Thanks to strong programs, the number of people globally requiring preventative treatment has dropped from 1.4 billion in 2011 to fewer than 950 million in 2015. Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT, or sleeping sickness): in 2015, there were fewer reported cases of sleeping sickness than any other year in history, with fewer than 3,000 cases worldwide – an 89 percent reduction since 2000. Innovative vector control and diagnostic technologies, supported by increasing numbers of product development partnerships, are revolutionizing sleeping sickness diagnosis, prevention and treatment. There was an eighty-two percent decrease in Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) cases in India, Nepal and Bangladesh: Since 2008, cases of VL across India, Nepal and Bangladesh have decreased by 82 percent due to improvements in vector control, social mobilization of village volunteers, collaboration with other NTD programs and drug donations from industry partners. Guinea worm disease nearing eradication: Cases of Guinea worm disease have reduced from an estimated 3.5 million in 1986 to just 25 human cases in 2016 in just three countries – Chad, Ethiopia and South Sudan. Global Donors Pledge Additional Support Governments and other donors announced new commitments at the summit to expand the reach and impact of NTD programs around the world. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation committed $335 million in grants over the next four years to support a diverse group of NTD programs focused on drug development and delivery, disease surveillance and vector control. The commitment includes $42 million to support The Carter Center’s guinea worm eradication initiative, as well as dedicated funding to accelerate the elimination of African sleeping sickness. “NTDs are some of the most painful, debilitating and stigmatizing diseases that affect the world’s poorest communities. That’s why we helped launch the London Declaration, a historic milestone that led to significant progress in treating and reducing the spread of NTDs and demonstrated the impact that the public sector, the private sector, communities and NGOs can have by working together,” said Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. “Thanks to this partnership, these neglected diseases are now getting the attention they deserve so fewer people have to suffer from these treatable conditions. There have been many successes in the past five years, but the job is not done yet. We have set ambitious targets for 2020 that require the continued commitment of pharmaceutical companies, donor and recipient governments, and frontline health workers to ensure drugs are available and delivered to the hardest to reach people.” The Belgian government also pledged an additional $27 million, spread equally over the next nine years, toward the elimination of sleeping sickness in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This amount will be matched for the next three years by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, establishing a platform for increased collaboration between Belgium, the DRC and the broader NTD partnership. As part of its commitment to eliminating HAT, Vestergaard pledged to donate 20 percent of its insecticide-treated “tiny targets” used to control the tsetse flies that carry the disease, scaling over the next three years towards 100 percent as elimination nears. These commitments build on the UK Government’s announcement earlier this week, in which it pledged almost $450 million over 5 years to support NTD control and elimination efforts around the world. Industry Contributions Expand Scale and Reach of NTD Program Progress against NTDs has been enabled by the large-scale donation of medicines by 10 pharmaceutical companies. In the five years since the London Declaration, companies have donated over 7 billion treatments that, with the support of partners, now reach nearly 1 billion people every year. These donations, worth an estimated $19 billion from 2012 through 2020, greatly multiply the impact of donor investments; USAID estimates that each dollar invested in delivery leverages $26 worth of donated drugs. Industry leaders in a statement reaffirmed their 2012 pledge to do their part to beat these diseases and encouraged other sectors to maintain their commitments as well. “The London Declaration is a powerful example of the impact of successful partnerships,” said Haruo Naito, CEO of Eisai, an original signatory of the London Declaration. “By leveraging our resources and focusing on a common goal, we are already making unprecedented progress towards eliminating these horrific diseases. The work we are doing today is a long-term investment into a healthier and more prosperous future.” In addition to donations, pharmaceutical companies are working together with research institutes to discover and develop new tools to prevent, diagnose and treat NTDs. A report released today by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations collected the full scope of industry investment in NTD R&D, including: Sanofi and the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) are developing a new oral drug candidate for HAT called Exinidazole, which would replace the current mixed oral-intravenous drug regimen. Fexinidazole could represent a therapeutic breakthrough which will support sustainable elimination efforts as per the WHO roadmap for 2020. The drug is expected to be submitted for regulatory approval later in 2017. Several companies are working to develop pediatric formulations of existing NTD medicines, including Bayer (Nifurtimox, for Chagas disease), Merck KGaA (Praziquantel, for schistosomiasis), and Elea/Mundo Sano (who are working with DNDi to develop a second pediatric source of benznidazole, for Chagas disease), while Johnson & Johnson (mebendazole, for soil-transmitted helminths) developed a new chewable form of mebendazole, recently approved by the FDA, for children too young to swallow. AbbVie, Bayer, Eisai, Johnson & Johnson and Merck KGaA are part of the Macrofilaricide Drug Accelerator Program, an initiative aimed at identifying and generating new drug compounds that can kill the adult worms that cause onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis. Bayer is working with DNDi to develop Emodepside, an oral treatment for lymphatic filariasis and river blindness Eisai is working with DNDi to develop Ravuconazole, a new oral drug currently in clinical trials for Chagas disease, and is partnering with DNDi to develop Ravuconazole in a new disease area, mycetoma. GlaxoSmithKline and DNDi have agreed to jointly pursue the pre-clinical development of the two novel candidates for the treatment of Visceral Leishmaniasis; the candidates were developed by a collaboration between GSK and the University of Dundee’s Drug Discovery Unit, and the work was funded by Wellcome. The agreement for pre-clinical development will be conditional on signing an additional agreement. In 2015, Eisai, Shionogi, Takeda, AstraZeneca and DNDi launched the NTD Drug Discovery Booster, a multi-company effort to accelerate the discovery of new drugs for Leishmaniasis and Chagas disease. In 2016 they were joined by Celgene Global Health. Merck KGaA announced today that it will join the consortium. Many companies – including AbbVie, Astra Zeneca, Bayer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Celgene, Chemo, Daiichi Sankyo, Eisai, Elea, Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Merck KGaA, MSD, Novartis, Pfizer, Sanofi, Shionogi, and Takeda – have given DNDi and other non-profits access to their compound libraries and/or contribute scientific and technical expertise to DNDi and conduct pre-clinical and clinical studies to facilitate the development of new drugs to combat various NTDs. Gilead is collaborating with the US Department of Defense, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and National Institutes of Health as well as multiple academic institutions to discover and develop novel antiviral drugs for highly pathogenic infections and neglected/emerging viral diseases, including dengue fever. GS-5734, Gilead’s most advanced investigational agent, is currently being studied in Ebola survivors. Companies are also working with partners to solve supply chain problems, develop program strategies and build in-country capacity to ensure that drugs, tools and other interventions reach those who need them most. Addressing the Challenges Ahead Though tremendous progress has been made in reducing the burden of NTDs, global control and elimination targets cannot be met without increased financial support, stronger political commitment and better tools to prevent, diagnose and treat the diseases. This week, partners from private philanthropy, affected country governments and cross-sector partnerships recommitted to leveraging their respective resources and expertise to fill critical gaps. Financial Resources Although nearly a billion people received NTD treatments in 2015, more funding is needed to ensure that NTD programs reach all people and communities affected by the diseases. WHO estimates that 340 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa could be covered by new investments of $150 million per year through the year 2020. In addition to government commitments, private philanthropy is helping to address these gaps by supporting drug delivery and surveillance programs, as well as research and development into new medicines, diagnostics and other health tools. The END Fund, founded shortly after the London Declaration, has raised over $75 million to target the five most common NTDs, helping to treat over 145 million people around the world. Political Commitment Strong leadership from affected countries is vital to sustaining progress against NTDs, particularly in the face of shifting economic climates and competing health priorities. Despite these challenges, some countries are increasing financing for NTD programs and integrating them into national health systems. Among other countries, Ethiopia has made significant strides in fighting trachoma by including progress against the disease as a target in its national health plan, providing significant domestic funding, participating in the Global Trachoma Mapping Project and training surgeons to conduct eye-lid surgeries to correct the effects of trachoma. “Ethiopia is fully committed to realizing ambitious, yet achievable, elimination targets for trachoma and other NTDs with proactive program coordination,” said H.E Professor Yifru Berhan Mitke, Ethiopian Minister of Health. “An increased direct program financial contribution by the government to NTDs, as high as 3 million USD by 2016, is a big step forward in alleviating the burden and stigma of these diseases.” New Tools and Innovations To meet control and elimination targets, more research and development is needed to provide NTD programs with improved tools to prevent, detect and treat the diseases. Promising new therapies are in the pipeline: A new three-drug regimen for LF known as triple therapy has the potential to dramatically accelerate the pace of elimination in affected countries and is currently on large-scale safety trials in India. R&D organizations such as PATH and partnerships like DNDi and the Global Health Innovative Technology Fund have catalyzed the development of better and more cost-effective tools. These innovations, which include new drugs and rapid diagnostic tests for sleeping sickness and river blindness, are especially critical in the low-resource settings most burdened by NTDs. Several new vector control tools are under development and being piloted to address the growing problem of diseases transmitted by the Aedes mosquito. Rest of NTDs are: Onchocerciasis (River blindness); Schistosomiasis; soil-transmitted helminths; Chagas and Leprosy.

2014-2017 & 2025 - Research and Markets News provided by Research and Markets Apr 19, 2017, 09:45 ET Share this article DUBLIN, Apr. 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Brain Tumor Diagnosis And Therapeutics Market Analysis By Type (MRI, CT Scan, Tissue Sampling, PET-CT Scan, Cerebral Arteriogram, Lumbar Puncture, Molecular Testing, And EEG), By Region, And Segment Forecasts, 2014 - 2025" report to their offering. The global brain tumor diagnosis and therapeutics market is expected to reach USD 773.1 million by 2025 The market is expected to pose lucrative growth over the forecast period, owing to increasing incidence of various brain cancers, particularly glioblastoma, coupled with rising geriatric population. Increasing Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in the health sector, which are modernizing diagnostic imaging and radiology services, are supporting the expansion of this industry. Emerging technologies like Sodium Magnetic Resonance Imaging(23Na MRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), and Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) are used to detect the response of brain tumors in multicenter clinical trial settings. In addition, these technologies are helpful in quantitatively imaging tumor response to therapies, thereby promoting their use during treatment. These technologies have the potential to extend MRI beyond anatomical imaging by providing information on physiology and cellular metabolism, thereby increasing the efficiency of diagnosis. Hence, the market is expected to witness productive growth over the forecast period. Moreover, ongoing research in molecular diagnostics to understand cell biology at cellular level of malignancy and identification of gene mutations associated with malignancy is anticipated to significantly contribute toward the growth of the industry. On the other hand, high cost of diagnosing brain tumors, which ranges from USD 450 to 12,200, is likely to hinder the growth of the global brain tumor diagnosis market. Further Key Findings From the Study Suggest: CT scan segment held a lucrative revenue share in 2015 and is also likely to grow at a significant rate during the forecast period Chemotherapy is anticipated to witness the fastest growth over the forecast period owing to presence of a large research pipeline by the industry players. North America is expected to dominate the brain tumor diagnosis and therapeutics market, owing to developed healthcare infrastructure coupled with rising awareness regarding advanced technologies amongst the population in this region. In addition, increasing consumer disposable income supported by healthcare insurance and reimbursement policies in the U.S. is expected to spur growth.

Some 1.5 billion people, mainly in Asia, Africa and Latin America, are infected with one of 18 neglected tropical diseases known as NTDs, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said. One billion of them are receiving treatment, half of them children. “The best thing with these diseases is not to debate whether they are neglected or not, but to proceed to make them history,” Bill Gates told a global partners’ meeting held at WHO. “We need a broader, deeper bench of investors… so that by 2030 we can achieve the goal of reaching 90 percent of the people who need treatment. I know this is achievable.” Gates, who has supported the initiative for over a decade with $1 billion, pledged $335 million over the next 4 years, including $42 million to continue efforts to wipe out Guinea-worm disease. The crippling disease, transmitted by contaminated water, can lead to a 100 cm long (40-inch) worm growing in the body. “Guinea worm is one of our great success stories, even though we’re not absolutely at zero, we are down to very small numbers. Thirty years ago over 3 million people in over 20 countries were afflicted,” Gates said. Only 25 cases of Guinea-worm disease were reported in six countries last year, “putting eradication within reach”, the WHO says. The Carter Center, set up by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, has worked for more than 20 years to wipe it out. “We are close to finishing off this debilitating disease,” Carter said, speaking by video from Atlanta, Georgia. “We cannot be complacent, we must be creative and persistent. The Carter Center will not give up until the last Guinea worm is gone.” Dengue, onchocerciasis (river blindness), and sleeping sickness are among those carried by mosquitoes or flies that are spreading from rural areas to urban slums, the WHO warned. “NTDs are really the diseases of neglected people, they are diseases of poverty and inequality that affect the most vulnerable among us,” World Bank President Jim Kim said by video. “Now we have the largest drug donation programme in history with 1.5 billion treatments in 2015 alone,” he said. GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis and Sanofi are among major donors, WHO says. Merck said on Tuesday it was developing a children’s formula of its drug to treat schistosomiasis, a parasitic worm disease which kills 280,000 a year in Africa. Britain’s Minister of State for International Development, Lord Bates, said the UK government was committing an additional 250 million pounds ($321.35 million) to NTD programmes. Belgium’s deputy prime minister Alexander de Croo pledged 25 million euros ($26.81 million) through 2025 to eradicate African sleeping sickness. “Today the stars are aligned to eradicate it completely,” de Croo told the talks. “The pay-off is huge”.

These diseases, which include kala azar, leprosy, lymphatic filariasis, intestinal worms such as hookworm, roundworms and whipworms, affect the poor and marginalised, are controllable and curable infections that deform, disable and kill if left untreated. “WHO has observed record-breaking progress towards bringing ancient scourges like sleeping sickness and elephantiasis to their knees,” said WHO Director-General, Dr Margaret Chan. “Over the past 10 years, millions have been rescued from disability and poverty, thanks to one of the most effective global partnerships in modern public health”. In 2012, international partners endorsed a WHO NTD Roadmap, committing additional support and resources to control, eliminate and eradicate of 10 of the most common diseases. “Good progress, some of these diseases are on track to be done (eliminated) by 2020, some by 2025. Some will take longer than that,” said Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which pledged $335 million over the next four years to fight NTDs. Over the five day conference, governments and donors pledged US$ 812, with nine drug companies including Merck, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis and Sanofi pledging to donate drugs and treatments till WHO’s NTDs elimination and eradication targets are met. Once widely prevalent, these diseases are now restricted to tropical and sub-tropical regions with unsafe water, inadequate hygiene and sanitation, and poor housing conditions. Poor people living in remote, rural areas, urban slums or conflict zones are most at risk, with more than 70% of countries reporting NTDs being low or lower-middle income economies. Around 556 million people received preventive treatment for lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis), more than 114 million people for river blindness (onchocerciasis) and 56 million for trachoma, the world’s leading cause of blindness that was eliminated in Mexico, Oman and Morocco. Only 25 human cases of Guinea-worm disease were reported in 2016, putting eradication within reach; sleeping sickness (human African trypanosomiasis) fell from 37,000 new cases in 1999 to well under 3,000 cases in 2015; and rabies deaths was brought down to in the Americas in 2015, bringing the region close to its target of eliminating rabies in humans. “Vector control, safe water and sanitation are key to control,” said Dr Dirk Engels, Director of the Department of Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases. The WHO estimates that 2.4 billion people still lack basic sanitation facilities such as toilets and latrines, while more than 660 million continue to drink water from “unimproved” sources, such as surface water.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 April 2017 by Monika Donimirska Global Hypercholesterolemia Treatment Market to Witness a Pronounce Growth by 2021 Hypercholesterolemia is caused due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Environmental factors include excessive diet intake and obesity. In case of genetic factors, the number of copies of the gene determines the severity of the disease. People with the homozygous form (two copies of the gene) generally suffer from severe cardiovascular diseases during childhood, while those with the heterozygous form (with a single copy of the gene) suffer from heart diseases in their 30s or 40s. The hypercholesterolemia treatment market is growing at a significant rate due to technological advancements in this field as well as the growing awareness about different cardiovascular diseases and the availability of their treatment options. Cholesterol is measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl) of blood. Treatment for hypercholesterolemia includes intake of statins and switching to a healthy lifestyle. A sample of this report is available upon request @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/4485 Hypercholesterolemia is a genetic disorder characterized by very high levels of cholesterol in the blood. Hypercholesterolemia, also termed as dyslipidemia, is a form of hyperlipidemia and hyperlipoproteinemia in the body. Presence of low-density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) or bad cholesterol in the blood, may lead to cardiovascular diseases. North America dominates the global market for hypercholesterolemia treatment due to the increasing prevalence of heart diseases and related complications in the region. In addition, technological advancements in the field are driving hypercholesterolemia treatment in North America. Asia, followed by Europe, is expected to witness a high growth rate in the next few years in the hypercholesterolemia treatment market. China and India are expected to be the fastest growing markets for treatment of hypercholesterolemia in Asia. Some of the key driving forces for the hypercholesterolemia treatment market in emerging countries are the presence of a large pool of patients and rising government initiatives in the form of funding and strict laws. In addition, increasing awareness in the field of cardiology is driving the market further. One of the major factors that have been driving the global card hypercholesterolemia treatment market is the significant increase in the prevalence of disorders related to disturbed cholesterol levels in the blood. In addition, factors such as rising awareness, technological advancements, government initiatives, and improvement in the reimbursement scenario in the field are driving the global hypercholesterolemia treatment market. However, factors such as high costs involved in the treatment and lack of experienced professionals for proper diagnosis of the disease are restraining the global hypercholesterolemia treatment market. In addition, lesser adoption rate of the available hypercholesterolemia treatment options is further restraining the market. Growing demographics and economies in the developing countries such as India and China are expected to offer good opportunities for the global hypercholesterolemia treatment market. Innovation of some new products with better efficiency is also expected to create good opportunities for the market. Rising number of mergers and acquisitions, new product launches, and increasing number of collaborations and partnerships are some of the latest trends that have been observed in the global hypercholesterolemia treatment market. Side effects associated with intake of statins are a challenge for the market.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 April 2017 by Monika Donimirska Global DPP IV Inhibitors Market to Surge at a Robust Pace in Terms of Revenue Over 2021 DPP IV inhibitors are a class of hypoglycemic agents that block the enzyme named dipeptidyl peptidase IV. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzyme break down the proteins that are responsible for stimulating the insulin producing cells that slows down gastric secretion. Proteins can activate the release of insulin and can control the blood sugar level if DPP IV is inhibited in our body. Moreover, DPP IV inhibitors restrict the formation of glucagon, a hormone that increases blood glucose level and thereby control the glucose levels in the body. DPP IV inhibitors are widely utilized as a treatment for type 2 diabetes. Sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin and linagliptin are included in the drug class DPP IV. Nasopharyngitis, headache, nausea and hypersensitivity are some of the adverse effects due to the utilization of DPP IV. A sample of this report is available upon request @ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/5453 Increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes is a major public health concern worldwide. National Centre for Biotechnology Information in 2011 stated that in the U.S. more than 8% of the total population is diagnosed with diabetes. Diabetes is associated with a number of complications that includes cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy. Thus, the above mentioned factors derives the global DPP IV inhibitors market. However, the cost for DPP IV inhibitors is very high that might hinder the global DPP IV inhibitors market. Geographically, North America and Europe dominates the global market for DPP IV inhibitors due to high prevalence rate and rising awareness among people about the DPP IV inhibitors. Asia – Pacific is considered as a fastest growing market due to increasing obese population. To view TOC of this report is available upon request @ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/toc/5453 Various key players contributing to the global DPP IV inhibitors market comprises Arisaph Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Eli Lilly And Company, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck & Co, Inc., AstraZeneca Plc, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited and Novartis AG.

They are also used in few cases of meningitis, pneumonia, and sepsis. The 2 types of vaccines available in the market are polysaccharide vaccines and conjugate vaccines. The vaccines are given intramuscular or subcutaneous. WHO has recommended using conjugated vaccine in routine immunization of children including those suffering from HIV/AIDS. In the 1980s, the first pneumococcal vaccine was developed and they are on WHO’s essential medicines list since then. The vaccines works well but cannot prevent 100% of cases. Research has shown that 1 dose of conjugated pneumococcal vaccine protects at least 80% of babies from pneumococcal disease, at least 75 % of adults above 65 years of age from pneumococcal disease, 45% of adults above 65 years of age from pneumococcal pneumonia. 1 dose of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine protects 50 to 85% OF healthy adults from pneumococcal disease. The polysaccharide vaccine is given in a single dose with one or two booster doses if required. Conjugate vaccine is given to babies in 3 doses at 2 month, 12 month and 15 months. Have Any Query? Ask Our Expert: www.qyresearchreports.us/send-an-enquiry/global-pneumococ… Research Pneumococcal bacteria have many serotypes which are geographically scattered throughout the world. Hence more R&D is required to find out the most effective vaccines, especially in developing countries. Research is being done, to develop a vaccine which can be administered through nose instead of skin or muscles. Also, antibodies which are serotype-specific, anticapsular and monoclonal are being studied recently and they have shown prolonged survival rates, decrease in inflammatory response and reduction of bacterial loads in mouse. Bill and Melinda Gates foundation and 5 countries across the world have invested 1.5 billion US dollars for research on the disease and reduce child mortality because of the same.

Human papillomavirus, or HPV, is the most common sexually transmitted disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which along with the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the three-dose (over a period of six months) vaccine at that age, meaning before kids generally become sexually active. More than 25 speakers — including doctors, researchers, executives from health-care foundations, high school students, cancer survivors and even a dentist — addressed Dr. Karen Hacker, head of the Allegheny County Health Department, and council members. Dr. Liz Miller, director of community health at Children's Hospital at Pittsburgh and a professor of pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh's School of Medicine, called the vaccine mandate "critically important" for "bridging the gap" in parts of Allegheny County where parents might not be educated on HPV, or where access to primary care is less likely. "The HPV vaccine is frankly a no-brainer," she said. According to the CDC, in most cases HPV will go away on its own. But when it doesn't, it can cause genital warts and cancers, including cervical cancer, cancer of the vulva, vagina, penis or anus. Cancer caused by HPV can also manifest itself in the throat, tongue and tonsils. Currently the vaccine is mandatory for school entry in Rhode Island, Virginia and Washington, D.C. "We have spoken with all three states to better understand their perspectives and experience," Hacker wrote in an email to City Paper. She says the vaccine is covered by most health-insurance plans and is included in the Affordable Care Act's preventive measures. John Rhodes, a 50-year-old assistant basketball coach for the Duquesne University Dukes, testified as a throat- and neck-cancer survivor. He called himself a "6-foot-9 walking billboard" for the HPV vaccine. He has been in remission for seven months after being treated for stage-four cancer that settled in his lymph nodes and was caused by HPV.  "My kids are vaccinated," he said. "As a coach and a competitive person, I challenge you [to mandate the vaccine]." Several doctors shared concern for the pain and complications their patients feel once they are diagnosed with a cancer caused by HPV. Dr. Umamaheswar Duvvuri, a head- and neck-cancer surgeon at UPMC and the local VA hospital, told the crowd about his 55-year-old male patient from Dubois, Pa., who found a lump on his neck. "I spent the day removing a large portion of this man's tongue," he said. "That could've been prevented." After the meeting, he explained that he and colleagues will be operating on six patients and treating four others for "oropharyngeal" cancers — head and neck cancers — and that those types of cancers are predicted to rise by 2020. Sixteen-year-old Sydney Reyes, of Riverview Junior-Senior High School, addressed another common argument against the vaccine — that it will encourage sexual promiscuity in teenagers. "This assumption can be resolved by having a proper discussion with your teen, not by blocking a vaccination," Reyes said. "Why should we risk a life like this when we really don't have to?" A few speakers against the vaccine mandate expressed their concerns to the councilors. A parent named Amy Rafferty read a letter from a friend whose daughter allegedly suffered severe hypertonia — muscles spasms — to the point where she couldn't walk anymore after receiving Gardasil, the HPV vaccine from Merck. James Lyons-Weiler, who formerly worked at the Hillman Cancer Center and who started his own research group entitled the "Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge," told the crowd he was concerned that the current vaccine would allow for stronger virus strains to attack humans in the future. Yesterday, Lyons-Weiler posted a 3,000-word essay on his blog denouncing the medical professionals who asked Allegheny County to mandate the vaccine. He also mentioned that he met Rafferty because she organized the local screening of VAXXED — an anti-vaccine documentary that was kicked off the Tribeca Film Festival schedule, and which City Paper's film critic Al Hoff said came "across as an infomercial by way of a conspiracy theory for a discredited argument." Speakers who followed opponents of the vaccine mandate contradicted their arguments. Hacker says the comments gathered at the hearing will be presented to the board of health in July. "They wanted us to consider what the public felt [about an HPV-vaccine mandate]," Hacker said by phone today.  If the board decides to recommend a mandate, a public-comment period would follow. Editor's note: This post has been udpated to include comments from Dr. Karen Hacker.

The trial, dubbed ADAPT, evaluated Rocapuldencel-T in combination with sunitinib/standard-of-care for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. In February of this year, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee, based on its planned interim data analysis, recommended that the study be discontinued as it was unlikely to meet the endpoints. However, the Company continued to keep the ADAPT trial open while it conducted data review. A post-hoc subgroup analysis of overall survival in the first one third of patients enrolled in the study, for whom generally the longest follow-up data was available, the estimated median overall survival for the combination arm was 30.1 months compared to 22.2 months for the control arm. It should be noted that at the time of the interim analysis by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee in February of this year, the estimated median overall survival for the combination arm was 27.7 months compared to 32.4 months for the control arm. Based on the data it has reviewed, the Company is of the view that the ADAPT trial should be continued until completion. Argos plans to meet with the FDA in May 2017. ARGS closed Tuesday's trading at $0.39, down 5.55%. In after-hours, the stock was up 68.75% to $0.66. Shares of Nivalis Therapeutics Inc. (NVLS) jumped more than 21% in extended trading on Tuesday after it agreed to merge with privately-held Alpine Immune Sciences Inc. The merger is expected to close in the third quarter of 2017. Following the merger, current Alpine shareholders will own approximately 74 percent of the combined company and current Nivalis shareholders will own approximately 26 percent of the combined company. The exchange ratio is based on a valuation of Nivalis equal to $50 million, which includes approximately $44 million in cash expected to be held by Nivalis at the time of closing. The combined company is expected to have approximately $90 million in cash and cash equivalents at the closing of the transaction, according to a Press Release by Nivalis. NVLS closed Tuesday's trading at $0.39, down 5.55%. In after-hours, the stock was up 68.75% to $0.66. Prima BioMed Ltd (PBMD) has been given the go-ahead for the third cohort of its phase I clinical trial for IMP321 in combination with Merck's KEYTRUDA being conducted in Australia. The third cohort will recruit six patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The first patient cohort results were released in December 2016. The data showed that IMP321 at the 1mg dose level is safe and well tolerated. PBMD closed Tuesday's trading at $2.42, down 2.81%. Shares of Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (RARE) were up more than 18% in extended trading on Tuesday, following positive 24-week data from its phase III study of Burosumab (KRN23) in adults with X-linked hypophosphatemia. X-linked hypophosphatemia, or XLH, is a rare, hereditary renal phosphate-wasting disorder characterized by hypophosphatemia, rickets and/or osteomalacia, and diminished growth. The study, which had enrolled 134 patients, met the primary endpoint of serum phosphorus response and key secondary endpoint of stiffness improvement. RARE closed Tuesday's trading at $60.08, down 2.23%. In after-hours, the stock was up 18.92% to $71.45. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Top Grossing foreign films in US Unhappy Campers: The 10 Most Miserable Nations on Earth Feeling Groovy: The 10 Countries With the Best Healthcare Previous Story Next Story Corporate News Nestle Q1 Sales Up 0.4%; Confirms 2017 Guidance Rio Tinto Q1 Iron Ore Production Down 3% Gainers & Losers Of Apr.19: SNGX, IMGN, CBLI, SSH, AKTX...

Browse the full report Global Pharmacogenomics Market – Growth, Share, Opportunities, Competitive Analysis, and Forecast, 2016 – 2024 at http://www.credenceresearch.com/report/pharmacogenomic-market Market Insights Pharmacogenomics or personalized medicine is defined as “the tailoring of medical treatment to the specific characteristics of each patient.” This concept in reality involves the ability to classify individuals into subpopulations that are uniquely or disproportionately susceptible to a particular disease or responsive to a specific treatment. Personalized medicine emphasizes on paradigm shift in medicine from reaction to prevention. The individual response to the drug varies according to the genetic composition. Most of the responses are positive and show improvement while few face the side effects. To address those variations, it is necessary to study how the drug processing is affected by the genes. So when the genetic variation is affecting the drug processing and response, there is scope of the clinical study to be conducted and based on the result, adjust the dosage or to find a different drug according to the genetic composition of an individual. Browse All Reports of This Category @ http://www.credenceresearch.com/industry/biotechnology-market Genetic study of an individual helps in predicting the susceptibility to disease, its progression and overall improves the diseases detection.

One billion people, mainly in Asia, Africa and Latin America, are still treated each year for at least one of 18 neglected tropical diseases known as NTDs, it said, Reuters reported. Dengue, onchocerciasis (river blindness), and sleeping sickness are among those carried by mosquitoes or flies that are spreading from rural areas to urban slums, the WHO warned. "There is no group of diseases that is so intimately linked to poverty," Dr. Dirk Engels, director of WHO's department of control of neglected tropic diseases, told a news briefing. "A number of companies have accompanied us in the scaling up by making more medicines available. Is that enough? No, there are still diseases that are neglected and we still have problems with access to basic medicines," he said. GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis and Sanofi are among major donors, WHO says. Merck said earlier it was developing a children's formula of its drug to treat schistosomiasis, a parasitic worm disease which kills 280,000 a year in Africa. New products need an access plan for patients "because just counting on the commercial mechanisms won’t work", Enders said. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is backing research and development into NTDs. Bill Gates met with CEOs of major pharmaceutical companies in Geneva on Tuesday. "Good progress, some of these diseases are on track to be done (eliminated) by 2020, some by 2025.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Companion Animal Vaccines Market: Emerging niche segments and regional markets Companion Animal Vaccines Market: Overview As sweeping societal changes occur worldwide, the trend of having animals as companions is on the rise. Many lonely aged people, nuclear families, and single persons are choosing to have an animal in their household. Estimates show that in the United States alone, about 62% of all households have a pet. Pet ownership numbers are also rising in other countries worldwide. However, animals are also the carriers of various diseases and infections that could be contracted by humans around them. Likewise, companion animals also stand the risk of contracting infections or diseases from humans around them. Vaccination is thus an important aspect that pet owners are urged not to neglect – for the safety of both the pets and owners alike. The companion animal vaccines market has seen an uptick in revenues in keeping with the growing popularity of keeping pets at home. Regular planned vaccinations are now regarded as being integral to the entire pet rearing and maintenance process. Consequently, the formulation of newer varieties of companion animal vaccines is helping this progress. Companion animal vaccines are administered not just to pets such as dogs, cats, pet reptiles, and the like, but also to livestock. Obtain Report Details: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/companion-animal-vacci… TMR projects a positive outlook for the global companion animal vaccines market in the near future. The market is expected to grow on account of the burgeoning number of pet owners in developing regions as well. The report is a comprehensive compilation of the emergent trends that are projected to palpably impact the future of this market and how companies are responding to this change. Global Companion Animal Vaccines Market: Key Drivers and Restraints Concerns associated with the rising prevalence of zoonotic diseases and the discovery of new diseases among animals are providing a push to the companion animal vaccines market. Besides this high-impact driver, the market is also gaining from the growing focus on implementing animal welfare initiatives and governments laying more emphasis on keeping animal-related diseases in check. However, developing animal vaccines is a rather lengthy and expensive process – the impact of which can be seen in the form of the high prices that these vaccines command. That puts them beyond the reach of some consumer classes, especially if suitable reimbursement schemes are not available to them. The other factor that is negatively impacting the companion animal vaccines market for livestock is the growing number of vegetarians in the world who may consume dairy products but not meat. Global Companion Animal Vaccines Market: Key Segments The report classifies the global companion animal vaccines market basis the following criteria: diseases, product, and technology. Based on product type, the market is segmented into feline, canine, bovine, and others. Likewise, the diseases for which companion animal vaccines are available include: Rabies, hepatitis, leukemia, and others. By technology used for the development and formulation of the vaccine, the global companion animal vaccines market has been segmented thus: DNA, recombinant, inactivated, toxoid, conjugate, and other vaccines. Considerable research is being undertaken to formulate more effective vaccines with lower price tags. Fill the form for an exclusive sample of this report: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Global Companion Animal Vaccines Market: Regional Outlook The global market for companion animal vaccines has been segmented as follows: Asia Pacific, North America, Europe, and Rest of the World. TMR projects the market to fare well in North America and Europe, where pet ownership numbers as well as meat consumption have been traditionally high. Europe currently accounts for a sizeable share in the global companion animal vaccines market. In Latin American and Asian countries, a new class of affluent consumers is emerging.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman U.S. Pet Medication Market: Current trends/opportunities/challenges Pet Medication is a branch of medicine that deals with the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease, disorder and injury in pet animals. The U.S. pet medication market is majorly driven by changing socio economic and cultural factors that have led to domestic pets being regarded as member of family. This in turn increases pet owner’s spending from innovative and specialized premium product and grooming expenses to medication drugs. Moreover, with the increasing trend of nuclear family and increasing disposable income the ownership of pets among middle class family is growing exponentially. The increasing number of pet owners and their growing concern towards pets, in turn is also expected to boost the U.S. pet medication market. However, the rising incident of pet allergy and increasing prices of pet medications products acts as restraining factor for the growth of pet care market. In addition, strict government regulations regarding pet ownership also hinders the growth of U.S. pet care market. The United States federal agency regulates the manufacturing and distribution of drugs and medications that are prescribed the veterinary animals. Veterinary prescription drugs are labeled for use only by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian. All veterinary prescription drugs must be properly labeled when dispensed. A complete label should include all the information set forth under the section on Basic Information for Records, Prescriptions, and Labels. Obtain Report Details: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/us-pet-medication-mark… The U.S. pet market has been segmented on the basis of pet type, type of medication and type of disease. On the basis of pet type the market is categorized into canine care medications, feline care medications, fish care medications, bird care medications and others pets. The canine care medication segment held the largest share in the U.S. pet medication market and is anticipated to experience a constant growth during the focus period. The rise in the number of canine owners and high spending on canine care, coupled with high adoption rate of canines for companionship and for security purpose is expected to further boost the demand for medications for canine care. The canine care medication market is followed by feline care medication market. On the basis of type of disease, the market can be segmented into parasite prevention and control (flea, tick, heartworm, etc.), cancer, pain management, behavioral health, diabetes, heart health, ear care and allergies. The parasite prevention and control segment held the largest share during the forecast period. Parasite attacks and itching problems is the most common problem of the pet animals. Merial’s Frontline Plus and Nexgard are the market leaders for the parasite and control drug. On the type of medication, the U.S. pet medication market can be segmented into antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, opioid pain relievers, steroids, antiparasitics, behavior-modifying drugs and sedatives and chemotherapeutics. The antiparasitic drugs held the largest share in this segment. These products are intended to prevent, repel or kill internal or external parasites such as intestinal worms, intestinal protozoans (Giardia, etc.), heartworms, fleas and ticks. Chemotherapeutics is anticipated to be the fastest growing segment in the U.S. pet medication market during the forecast period of 2015-2023. Fill the form for an exclusive sample of this report: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Some of the major companies participating in the U.S. pet medications market include Bayer Animal Health, Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Ceva Sante Animale, Novartis Animal Health, Elanco, Merial, Merck Animal Health, Zoetis and others.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Antiemetic Drugs Market: Advanced Technologies & Growth Opportunities in Global Industry by 2023 Nausea and vomiting are symptoms of some medical conditions like pregnancy, motion sickness, food poisoning, dizziness. They are also known to be the side effects of chemotherapy, radiation, anesthesia or opioid analgesics. Post-operative nausea and vomiting is one of the common complication after surgery whereas chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting is the most feared side effect of chemotherapy. Nausea and vomiting are not life threatening but may lead to other complications like weight loss, dehydration, erosion of the tooth and loss of appetite. If not treated they can interfere with the daily activity and can affect the quality of life. Nausea and vomiting are known as emesis and the drugs used in the management of nausea and vomiting are known as Antiemetic. Browse Market Research Report @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/antiemetic-drugs-marke… The Antiemetic drug market is segmented on the basis of drug class and geography. On the basis of class it is classified as 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, Dopamine antagonists, NK1 receptor antagonist, Antihistamines, Cannabinoids and Others. According to few studies carried out it was seen that 5-HT3 antagonist are found to be very effective preventing nausea and vomiting in chemotherapy and radiations. Recently U.S. Food and Drug Administration sanctioned Varubi (rolapitant -NK-1 receptor antagonist) to stop delayed phase chemotherapy-induced emesis. It is accepted in adults and need to be given in combination with other antiemetic drugs that prevent emesis related with early and recurrence courses of vomit-inducing cancer chemotherapy. Domperidone leads the dopamine antagonists while Dronabinols is the biggest selling drug from Cannabinoid. On the basis of the geography, the artificial organ market can be segmented into North America), Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Rest of the World. Asia pacific has reported to be the fastest growing market due to large number of cancer patients. Fill the form to gain deeper insights on this market @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… The antiemetic drug market will grow strongly in the coming years due to the increasing number of cancer patients. Nausea and vomiting can result from surgery and radiation also but cancer induced nausea and vomiting are severe and disturbing. In chemotherapy more than 60% of patients suffer from nausea and vomiting. Chemotherapeutic agents such as Cisplatin and Carmustine causes nausea and vomiting in more than 90% of the patients. Also the research activities carried out to innovate the therapy are responsible to drive the market. The lack of appropriate animal model to imitate the human reaction is a restraint for the antiemetic drug market. Use of novel drug deliveries and several drugs in the pipelines will act as an opportunity for the manufacturers and can increase the market share of antiemetic drugs. Some of the major players in the antiemetic drug market are GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited, Johnson & Johnson, Sanofi, Merck & Co., Novartis AG,Bristol-Myers Squibb, Astellas Pharma, Inc., Eli Lilly, Abbott, Cipla Ltd, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd, Baxter International, IPCA Labs and others.

Health World World Leaders Recommit to Ending Neglected Tropical Diseases, Citing Remarkable Progress Since 2012 By DTN - April 19, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter This week, leaders from governments, pharmaceutical companies and charitable organizations convened at a five-day summit in Geneva to pledge new commitments to the collective efforts to control and eliminate neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). The summit coincided with the launch of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Fourth Report on NTDs, showing transformational progress against these debilitating diseases, and a commitment by the United Kingdom to more than double its funding for NTDs. The meeting comes five years after the launch of the London Declaration on NTDs, a commitment by the public and private sectors to achieve the WHO goals for control, elimination and eradication of 10 NTDs. In that time, billions of treatments have been donated by pharmaceutical companies and delivered to impoverished communities in nearly 150 countries, reaching nearly a billion people in 2015. NTDs are some of the oldest and most painful diseases, afflicting the world’s poorest communities. One in six people suffer from NTDs worldwide, including more than half a billion children. NTDs disable, debilitate and perpetuate cycles of poverty, keeping children out of school, parents out of work, and dampening hope of any chance of an economic future. New Report Shows Dramatic Progress A new report titled Integrating Neglected Tropical Diseases in Global Health and Development (http://APO.af/GaR2bN) by the WHO revealed that more people are being reached with needed NTD interventions than ever before. In 2015, nearly a billion people received treatments donated by pharmaceutical companies for at least one NTD, representing a 36 percent increase since 2011, the year before the launch of the London Declaration. As more districts, countries and regions eliminate NTDs, the number of people requiring treatments has decreased from 2 billion in 2010 to 1.6 billion in 2015. “WHO has observed record-breaking progress towards bringing ancient scourges like sleeping sickness and elephantiasis to their knees,” says WHO Director-General, Dr. Margaret Chan. “Over the past 10 years, millions of people have been rescued from disability and poverty, thanks to one of the most effective global partnerships in modern public health.” The report detailed progress against each disease, citing countries and regions that are reaching control and elimination goals for specific NTDs. Highlights include: Lymphatic filariasis (LF) racing toward finish line: In the last year, eight countries (Cambodia, Cook Islands, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Niue, Sri Lanka, Togo and Vanuatu) eliminated LF, and 10 other countries are waiting on surveillance results to verify elimination. Thanks to strong programs, the number of people globally requiring preventative treatment has dropped from 1.4 billion in 2011 to fewer than 950 million in 2015. Fewest-ever cases of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT, or sleeping sickness): In 2015, there were fewer reported cases of sleeping sickness than any other year in history, with fewer than 3,000 cases worldwide – an 89 percent reduction since 2000. Innovative vector control and diagnostic technologies, supported by increasing numbers of product development partnerships, are revolutionizing sleeping sickness diagnosis, prevention and treatment. Eighty-two percent decrease in visceral leishmaniasis (VL) cases in India, Nepal and Bangladesh: Since 2008, cases of VL across India, Nepal and Bangladesh have decreased by 82 percent due to improvements in vector control, social mobilization of village volunteers, collaboration with other NTD programs and drug donations from industry partners. Guinea worm disease nearing eradication: Cases of Guinea worm disease have reduced from an estimated 3.5 million in 1986 to just 25 human cases in 2016 in just three countries – Chad, Ethiopia and South Sudan. Global Donors Pledge Additional Support Governments and other donors announced new commitments at the summit to expand the reach and impact of NTD programs around the world. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation committed $335 million in grants over the next four years to support a diverse group of NTD programs focused on drug development and delivery, disease surveillance and vector control. The commitment includes $42 million to support The Carter Center’s guinea worm eradication initiative, as well as dedicated funding to accelerate the elimination of African sleeping sickness. “NTDs are some of the most painful, debilitating and stigmatizing diseases that affect the world’s poorest communities. That’s why we helped launch the London Declaration, a historic milestone that led to significant progress in treating and reducing the spread of NTDs and demonstrated the impact that the public sector, the private sector, communities and NGOs can have by working together,” said Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. “Thanks to this partnership, these neglected diseases are now getting the attention they deserve so fewer people have to suffer from these treatable conditions. There have been many successes in the past five years, but the job is not done yet. We have set ambitious targets for 2020 that require the continued commitment of pharmaceutical companies, donor and recipient governments, and frontline health workers to ensure drugs are available and delivered to the hardest to reach people.” The Belgian government also pledged an additional $27 million, spread equally over the next nine years, toward the elimination of sleeping sickness in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This amount will be matched for the next three years by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, establishing a platform for increased collaboration between Belgium, the DRC and the broader NTD partnership. As part of its commitment to eliminating HAT, Vestergaard pledged to donate 20 percent of its insecticide-treated “tiny targets” used to control the tsetse flies that carry the disease, scaling over the next three years towards 100 percent as elimination nears. These commitments build on the UK Government’s announcement earlier this week, in which it pledged almost $450 million over 5 years to support NTD control and elimination efforts around the world. Industry Contributions Expand Scale and Reach of NTD Program Progress against NTDs has been enabled by the large-scale donation of medicines by 10 pharmaceutical companies. In the five years since the London Declaration, companies have donated over 7 billion treatments that, with the support of partners, now reach nearly 1 billion people every year. These donations, worth an estimated $19 billion from 2012 through 2020, greatly multiply the impact of donor investments; USAID estimates that each dollar invested in delivery leverages $26 worth of donated drugs. In a statement (http://APO.af/55buit) released today, industry leaders reaffirmed their 2012 pledge to do their part to beat these diseases, and encouraged other sectors to maintain their commitments as well. “The London Declaration is a powerful example of the impact of successful partnerships,” said Haruo Naito, CEO of Eisai and an original signatory of the London Declaration. “By leveraging our resources and focusing on a common goal, we are already making unprecedented progress towards eliminating these horrific diseases. The work we are doing today is a long-term investment into a healthier and more prosperous future.” In addition to donations, pharmaceutical companies are working together and with research institutes to discover and develop new tools to prevent, diagnose and treat NTDs. A report (http://APO.af/YkMskp) released today by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations collected the full scope of industry investment in NTD R&D, including: Sanofi and the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) are developing a new oral drug candidate for HAT, fexinidazole, which would replace the current mixed oral-intravenous drug regimen. Fexinidazole could represent a therapeutic breakthrough which will support sustainable elimination efforts as per the WHO roadmap for 2020. The drug is expected to be submitted for regulatory approval later in 2017. Several companies are working to develop pediatric formulations of existing NTD medicines, including Bayer (nifurtimox, for Chagas disease), Merck KGaA (praziquantel, for schistosomiasis), and Elea/Mundo Sano (who are working with DNDi to develop a second pediatric source of benznidazole, for Chagas disease), while Johnson & Johnson (mebendazole, for soil-transmitted helminths) developed a new chewable form of mebendazole, recently approved by the FDA, for children too young to swallow. AbbVie, Bayer, Eisai, Johnson & Johnson and Merck KGaA are part of the Macrofilaricide Drug Accelerator Program, an initiative aimed at identifying and generating new drug compounds that can kill the adult worms that cause onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis. Bayer is working with DNDi to develop emodepside, an oral treatment for lymphatic filariasis and river blindness Eisai is working with DNDi to develop ravuconazole, a new oral drug currently in clinical trials for Chagas disease, and is partnering with DNDi to develop ravuconazole in a new disease area, mycetoma. GlaxoSmithKline and DNDi have agreed to jointly pursue the pre-clinical development of the two novel candidates for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis; the candidates were developed by a collaboration between GSK and the University of Dundee’s Drug Discovery Unit, and the work was funded by Wellcome. The agreement for pre-clinical development will be conditional on signing an additional agreement. In 2015, Eisai, Shionogi, Takeda, AstraZeneca and DNDi launched the NTD Drug Discovery Booster, a multi-company effort to accelerate the discovery of new drugs for leishmaniasis and Chagas disease. In 2016 they were joined by Celgene Global Health. Merck KGaA announced today that it will join the consortium. Many companies – including AbbVie, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Celgene, Chemo, Daiichi Sankyo, Eisai, Elea, Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Merck KGaA, MSD, Novartis, Pfizer, Sanofi, Shionogi, and Takeda – have given DNDi and other non-profits access to their compound libraries and/or contribute scientific and technical expertise to DNDi and conduct pre-clinical and clinical studies to facilitate the development of new drugs to combat various NTDs. Gilead is collaborating with the US Department of Defense, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and National Institutes of Health as well as multiple academic institutions to discover and develop novel antivirals for highly pathogenic infections and neglected/emerging viral diseases, including dengue fever. GS-5734, Gilead’s most advanced investigational agent, is currently being studied in Ebola survivors. Companies are also working with partners to solve supply chain problems, develop program strategies and build in-country capacity to ensure that drugs, tools and other interventions reach those who need them most. Addressing the Challenges Ahead Though tremendous progress has been made in reducing the burden of NTDs, global control and elimination targets cannot be met without increased financial support, stronger political commitment and better tools to prevent, diagnose and treat the diseases. This week, partners from private philanthropy, affected country governments and cross-sector partnerships recommitted to leveraging their respective resources and expertise to fill critical gaps. Financial Resources Although nearly a billion people received NTD treatments in 2015, more funding is needed to ensure that NTD programs reach all people and communities affected by the diseases. WHO estimates that 340 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa could be covered by new investments of $150 million per year through the year 2020. In addition to government commitments, private philanthropy is helping to address these gaps by supporting drug delivery and surveillance programs, as well as research and development into new medicines, diagnostics and other health tools. The END Fund (www.END.org), founded shortly after the London Declaration, has raised over $75 million to target the five most common NTDs, helping to treat over 145 million people around the world. Political Commitment Strong leadership from affected countries is vital to sustaining progress against NTDs, particularly in the face of shifting economic climates and competing health priorities. Despite these challenges, some countries are increasing financing for NTD programs and integrating them into national health systems. Among other countries, Ethiopia has made significant strides in fighting trachoma by including progress against the disease as a target in its national health plan, providing significant domestic funding, participating in the Global Trachoma Mapping Project and training surgeons to conduct eye-lid surgeries to correct the effects of trachoma. “Ethiopia is fully committed to realizing ambitious, yet achievable, elimination targets for trachoma and other NTDs with proactive program coordination,” said H.E Professor Yifru Berhan Mitke, Ethiopian Minister of Health. “An increased direct program financial contribution by the government to NTDs, as high as 3 million USD by 2016, is a big step forward in alleviating the burden and stigma of these diseases.” New Tools and Innovations To meet control and elimination targets, more research and development is needed to provide NTD programs with improved tools to prevent, detect and treat the diseases. Promising new therapies are in the pipeline: A new three-drug regimen for LF known as triple therapy has the potential to dramatically accelerate the pace of elimination in affected countries, and is currently in large-scale safety trials in India. R&D organizations such as PATH and partnerships like DNDi and the Global Health Innovative Technology Fund have catalyzed the development of better and more cost-effective tools. These innovations, which include new drugs and rapid diagnostic tests for sleeping sickness and river blindness, are especially critical in the low-resource settings most burdened by NTDs. Several new vector control tools are under development and being piloted to address the growing problem of diseases transmitted by Aedes mosquitos. The Global Partners Meeting on Neglected Tropical Diseases (http://APO.af/oloCnt) will be hosted by the World Health Organization on 19 April 2017. From 20-22 April, Uniting to Combat NTDs and the global NTD community will host the NTD Summit (http://APO.af/mEY60y), which will feature technical discussions on the best strategies to reach the NTD control and elimination goals.

(26: 50 ) – Episode Round Up: Podcast@Zacks.com Welcome to Episode #78 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast. Every week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life. In this episode, Tracey is joined by Kevin Cook, Zacks Senior Strategist and the editor of the newly launched newsletter service the Healthcare Innovators . Healthcare stocks have gotten a bad rap over the last few years as the biotech rally faltered and on worries about drug pricing and the repeal of Obamacare. But healthcare covers many industries. Zacks includes 800 stocks in its medical sector including those involved in devices, eye care, dentistry, staffing, rehabilitation, information systems and nursing homes. While there have been disruptive technologies in tech, social media and even in retail, few are paying any attention to the possibilities in healthcare. That means there is an opening for investors. Uncovering the Hidden Gems in Healthcare Some companies get a lot of publicity for their medical breakthroughs, and rightly so. But there are a group of smaller companies that are creating devices and therapies that are enhancing patient lives that you might never have even heard of. Tracey recently stumbled across two of those: 1.       While doing a Hidden Gem video, she ran across BioTelemetry (BEAT) which makes wireless cardiac monitoring devices. It’s expected to see double digit earnings growth in 2017 and 2018. 2.       She came across Insulet (PODD), the maker of insulin management systems, after insiders bought shares. Tracey held it in her Insider Trader portfolio for several months. It’s not yet profitable, but it’s also expected to see double digit earnings growth the next 2 years. Immuno-oncology Could Be Huge An area that Kevin is watching closely, as is the rest of the world, is immune-oncology. This is a technique of using the body’s own immune system to fight cancer. Several companies are involved in this hot area including Incyte (INCY), Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb. There are several Phase III trials ongoing which is the critical juncture for these treatments. (Fingers crossed.) What Other Companies Are Pushing the Envelope? 1.       Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is looking to break out to new highs again. It makes robotic surgical systems. The stock isn’t cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of 38 but you’re buying it for the growth story. 2.       Edwards Lifesciences (EW) is a leading manufacturer of heart valves. Shares are trading at 28x but earnings are expected to grow in the double digits in 2017 and 2018. 3.       Neurocrine Biosciences (NBIX) researches drugs for neurological and endocrine disorders. It’s been in the news lately because the FDA approved its first drug for movement disorder tardive dyskinesia, or TD. There are a lot of opportunities in the healthcare stocks. How do you narrow down the choices? Kevin discusses his methods for picking stocks, starting with the Zacks Rank, and how he will pick the 20 or so companies that will make up his Healthcare Innovators portfolio. What other exciting breakthroughs could be on the way in healthcare and how can you invest in it? Find out the answer to this and more on this week’s podcast. Interested in Healthcare Innovators?

Some 1.5 billion people, mainly in Asia, Africa and Latin America, are infected with one of 18 neglected tropical diseases known as NTDs, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said. One billion of them are receiving treatment, half of them children. "The best thing with these diseases is not to debate whether they are neglected or not, but to proceed to make them history," Bill Gates told a global partners' meeting held at WHO. "We need a broader, deeper bench of investors... so that by 2030 we can achieve the goal of reaching 90 percent of the people who need treatment. I know this is achievable." Gates, who has supported the initiative for over a decade with $1 billion, pledged $335 million over the next 4 years, including $42 million to continue efforts to wipe out Guinea-worm disease. The crippling disease, transmitted by contaminated water, can lead to a 100 cm long (40-inch) worm growing in the body. "Guinea worm is one of our great success stories, even though we're not absolutely at zero, we are down to very small numbers. Thirty years ago over 3 million people in over 20 countries were afflicted," Gates said. Only 25 cases of Guinea-worm disease were reported in six countries last year, "putting eradication within reach", the WHO says. The Carter Center, set up by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, has worked for more than 20 years to wipe it out. "We are close to finishing off this debilitating disease," Carter said, speaking by video from Atlanta, Georgia. "We cannot be complacent, we must be creative and persistent. The Carter Center will not give up until the last Guinea worm is gone." Dengue, onchocerciasis (river blindness), and sleeping sickness are among those carried by mosquitoes or flies that are spreading from rural areas to urban slums, the WHO warned. "NTDs are really the diseases of neglected people, they are diseases of poverty and inequality that affect the most vulnerable among us," World Bank President Jim Kim said by video. "Now we have the largest drug donation programme in history with 1.5 billion treatments in 2015 alone," he said. GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis and Sanofi are among major donors, WHO says. Merck said on Tuesday it was developing a children's formula of its drug to treat schistosomiasis, a parasitic worm disease which kills 280,000 a year in Africa. Britain's Minister of State for International Development, Lord Bates, said the UK government was committing an additional 250 million pounds ($321.35 million) to NTD programmes. Belgium's deputy prime minister Alexander de Croo pledged 25 million euros ($26.81 million) through 2025 to eradicate African sleeping sickness. "Today the stars are aligned to eradicate it completely," de Croo told the talks. "The pay-off is huge".

Personalized medicine emphasizes on paradigm shift in medicine from reaction to prevention. The individual response to the drug varies according to the genetic composition. Most of the responses are positive and show improvement while few face the side effects. To address those variations, it is necessary to study how the drug processing is affected by the genes. So when the genetic variation is affecting the drug processing and response, there is scope of the clinical study to be conducted and based on the result, adjust the dosage or to find a different drug according to the genetic composition of an individual. Browse All Reports of This Category @ http://www.credenceresearch.com/industry/biotechnology-market Genetic study of an individual helps in predicting the susceptibility to disease, its progression and overall improves the diseases detection.

This may lead to an uncontrolled spread of cancer tumors in the body. These cancer tumors are benign or malignant type. Benign tumors are non-cancerous and do not spread to other parts of the body. Malignant tumors spread throughout the body through lymph and blood. There are more than 100 types of cancers and most of them are named based on the organ or types of the cell where they occur. For example, thyroid cancer refers to the cancer of thyroid gland, pancreatic cancer is the cancer in the tissue of pancreas and lung cancer refers to the cancer in the tissue of lungs. Cancer vaccines enables to prevent the growth of cancer or reduce the risk of an individual.

Also, it is predicted that annual cancer cases will rise to 14 million to 22 million in next two decades. In addition, it is stated by National Cancer Institute that there are approximately 1,660,290 cases reported in the United States in year 2013. These increasing incidences of cancer cases drives the market of cancer vaccines during the forecast period. The major driving factor of cancer vaccines is that these are low cost treatment as compared to the high cost cancer therapies which are commercially available. Moreover, increasing use of tobacco, alcohol and unhealthy dietary habits are leading risk factors for increasing number of cancer cases that will further propel the growth of cancer vaccines market. However, less number of commercially available vaccines for the treatment of cancer might restrain the market growth. Geographically, North America and Europe dominates the global cancer vaccines market due to large patient base and rise in treatment seeking population in these regions. Also, with the rise in geriatric population the number of people diagnosed with cancer also increases that ultimately impacts the growth of cancer vaccines in these markets. The market of cancer vaccines in Asia-Pacific holds a strong growth as there is a rise in total number of newly diagnosed patient population in this region. According to World Health Organization, 60% of the world’s annual cases occur in Africa, Asia and South America.
