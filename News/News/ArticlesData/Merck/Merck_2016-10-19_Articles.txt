Dr. Mike Bolton, DVM, a member of Merck’s Dairy Technical Services team, sat down for an interview during this year’s Dairy Expo. He talked some of the features available as the series has updated and how they fit nicely into the increasing regulations and requirements facing dairy producers in the next year. The Dairy Care365 program is part of a partnership between Merck and the National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF), the creators of the National Dairy FARM Program for animal care. Two of the programs newest videos in the series are part of a two-episode module on bio-awarism, which focuses on providing farm employees with a diverse overview of proper biosecurity protocol. “Bio-awarism is a combination of biosecurity, threats from outside of your farm and threats from within your operation, and the videos explain to workers why they have to follow these requirements and what is important to keep the disease within your farm on a controlled level by managing flow and traffic on your farm,” said Dr. Bolton. “The videos talk a lot about things that aren’t rocket science but definitely bear repeating: Things like proper vaccine handling, impressing on employees why its not a good idea to take a shortcut through the sick pen to feed the calves, things that like that, which are common sense ideas that they may not have had much education on.” Learn more in Jamie’s full interview with Dr. Bolton here: Interview with Dr. Mike Bolton, DVM, Merck View and download photos from the event here: 2016 World Dairy Expo Photo Album.

(MRK) Stock Now MRK stock's momentum isn't going to end anytime soon By Ryan Fuhrmann, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Oct 20, 2016, 12:49 pm EST     View All   Popular Posts: 3 Beaten-Down Healthcare Stocks to Buy Recent Posts: 3 Beaten-Down Healthcare Stocks to Buy 3 Blue-Chip Stocks With Hidden Benefits Nothing Can Stop Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) Stock Now View All Posts Shares of pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) have been on a roll lately. MRK stock jumped last week and reached its highest levels over the past year. It also returned to highs last seen in 2001, a distant memory considering this was back when the dot-com bubble was still bursting. Returning to its all-time highs of nearly two decades ago will still take time, but Merck stock’s momentum could easily continue. Source: Ryan via Wikimedia (Modified) The positive news for MRK stemmed from favorable results for a cancer drug called Keytruda that treats non-small cell lung cancer. The drug is in a category of revolutionary treatments known as immunoncology that use the body’s own immune system to tackle even the most serious cancerous tumors. More on that below. Pharma rival Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY) offers a competing treatment called Opdivo, which also focuses on NSCLC but targets a larger class of patients. Merck & Co.’s drug is more targeted to patients with a higher level of a protein called PD-L1, and the recent results confirmed it works better in patients with these higher levels. Bristol also released results to indicate this to be the case. The market’s recent excitement about MRK is certainly warranted and continues a trend of positive news for Keytruda over Opdivo. However, the case can be made that both drugs stand a good chance of generating several billions of dollars in new sales within a couple of years for both firms. 7 Tech Stocks That Will Ride Healthcare to Riches The emphasis on Keytruda is also overshadowing Merck’s overall appeal as a worthy investment candidate in the pharmaceutical industry. Merck & Co. and the Overall Appeal of Pharma Overall, the pharmaceutical industry is a great place to find appealing individual investment opportunities. Patent expiration of major “blockbuster” drugs meant lost revenue for many years, but that appeared to bottom out last year. For all of 2016, the industry is projected to report positive sales. The immunoncology space has perhaps the best potential for investment upside. In addition to MRK and Bristol, biotechnology (closely related to pharma, especially the larger players) firm Amgen, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) sells IO-based drug Blincyto to combat leukemia. AstraZeneca plc (ADR) (NYSE:AZN) is looking to beef up its IO research over time. Kite Pharma Inc (NASDAQ:KITE) is a smaller biotech firm competing in the space and is focused on blood cancers, including leukemia and lymphomas. Pharma stocks are also trading at very reasonable P/E ratios right now. Many are well below market multiples, which currently stand at 24.3 on a trailing basis and 18.1 on a forward basis. This basic measure of a stock’s value is simple, but important, and as we’ll see with MRK stock, looking at both the historical and prospective level can be important. Finally, the prospect of higher interest rates could be having an adverse effect on the share prices of firms in industries with above-average dividend yields. This is because investors are starting to shift back to bonds at the expense of income-producing stocks. Yields are still low, but the prices of bonds are much less volatile than stocks. This could explain the recent tepid performance of pharma stocks. Most of the key players again sport yields above 3%, which is well above the market average of 2.1%. Merck Stock in Focus MRK stock has momentum right now. It operates in an appealing industry, and is a first mover in the IO space. Merck & Co. stock is currently riding high, while Bristol’s stock has fallen to $50 per share, or 35% below its highs in the past year. In addition to Keytruda, Merck has an appealing offering of new and existing drugs, and those in the pipeline have strong potential. Januvia is Merck & Co.’s top selling drug and treats diabetes. Bridion is an anesthetic. Zepatier treats hepatitis C and will start competing with offerings from Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) and AbbVie Inc (NYSE:ABBV). MRK also has a sizeable offering to treat HIV and a promising pipeline in the space.

Debio 1143 is currently in Phase II development for Head & Neck and Ovarian Cancer. Avelumab is under clinical investigation across a broad range of tumor types by the Merck-Pfizer Alliance. Under the terms of the agreement, Debiopharm will be responsible for conducting the Phase I/Ib clinical trial in NSCLC. "We are delighted to initiate this collaboration in immuno-oncology with the Merck-Pfizer Alliance. It is a great opportunity to explore in the clinic the immunomodulatory properties of Debio 1143 observed in preclinical studies," said Dr Chris Freitag, Vice President, Clinical Research & Development, Debiopharm International SA. "We are hopeful that the immunosensitizing effect of our compound in combination with avelumab may translate into a potentially better treatment outcome for patients suffering from this major debilitating disease." Globally, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women, responsible for more deaths than colon, breast and prostate cancer combined.[1] NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for 80-85% of all lung cancers.[2] The 5-year survival rate for people diagnosed with late-stage lung cancer that has spread (metastasized) to other areas of the body is 4%.[3] "Inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has shown promising activity in patients with advanced NSCLC," said Alise Reicin, M.D., Head of Global Clinical Development in the biopharma business of Merck. "We hope that our exploration of avelumab as a combination therapy with Debio 1143 will generate results that could potentially one day make a real difference to patients fighting this deadly cancer." "Investigating the potential of combination therapy is an important strategic focus for the Merck-Pfizer Alliance," said Chris Boshoff, M.D., Ph.D., Head of Immuno-Oncology, Early Development, and Translational Oncology at Pfizer. "This collaboration with Debiopharm provides a significant opportunity to explore the potential synergistic effects of these two agents in combination." About Debio 1143  Debio 1143 is an oral, small molecule inhibitor of IAPs (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins) that promotes apoptosis of cancer cells by mimicking the activity of the natural Second Mitochondrial-derived Activator of Caspases (SMAC). Evasion of apoptosis is a hallmark of cancer and a common mechanism of resistance to current treatments and Debio 1143 is being investigated as chemo- and radio-sensitizer in Ovarian Cancer and Head & Neck Cancer. In addition, like other members of the class, Debio 1143 displays strong immunomodulatory properties that make it a natural candidate for combination with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors. About Avelumab  Avelumab (also known as MSB0010718C) is an investigational, fully human antibody specific for a protein found on tumor cells called PD-L1, or programmed death ligand-1. Avelumab is thought to have a dual mechanism of action which may enable the immune system to find and attack cancer cells. By binding to PD-L1, avelumab is thought to prevent tumor cells from using PD-L1 for protection against white blood cells such as T-cells, exposing them to anti-tumor responses. Avelumab is also thought to help white blood cells such as natural killer (NK) cells find and attack tumors in a process known as ADCC, or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In November 2014, Merck, the science and technology company, and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab. About Debiopharm International SA  Debiopharm Group(TM) is a Swiss-based global biopharmaceutical group of five companies active in the development and manufacture of drugs and diagnostics tools. Debiopharm focuses on developing prescription drugs that target unmet medical needs. The group in-licenses and develops promising drug candidates. The products are commercialized by pharmaceutical out-licensing partners to give access to the largest number of patients worldwide.

Avelumab is thought to have a dual mechanism of action which may enable the immune system to find and attack cancer cells. By binding to PD-L1, avelumab is thought to prevent tumor cells from using PD-L1 for protection against white blood cells such as T-cells, exposing them to anti-tumor responses. Avelumab is also thought to help white blood cells such as natural killer (NK) cells find and attack tumors in a process known as ADCC, or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In November 2014, Merck, the science and technology company, and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab.

Debio1143 is currently in Phase II development for Head & Neck and Ovarian Cancer. Avelumab is under clinical investigation across a broad range of tumor types by the Merck-Pfizer Alliance. Under the terms of the agreement, Debiopharm will be responsible for conducting the Phase I/Ib clinical trial in NSCLC. "We are delighted to initiate this collaboration in immuno-oncology with the Merck-Pfizer Alliance. It is a great opportunity to explore in the clinic the immunomodulatory properties of Debio1143 observed in preclinical studies," said Dr Chris Freitag, Vice President, Clinical Research & Development, DebiopharmInternationalSA. "We are hopeful that the immunosensitizing effect of our compound in combination with avelumab may translate into a potentially better treatment outcome for patients suffering from this major debilitating disease." Globally, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women, responsible for more deaths than colon, breast and prostate cancer combined.[1] NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for 80-85% of all lung cancers.[2] The 5-year survival rate for people diagnosed with late-stage lung cancer that has spread (metastasized) to other areas of the body is 4%.[3] "Inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has shown promising activity in patients with advanced NSCLC," said Alise Reicin, M.D., Head of Global Clinical Development in the biopharma business of Merck. "We hope that our exploration of avelumab as a combination therapy with Debio1143 will generate results that could potentially one day make a real difference to patients fighting this deadly cancer." "Investigating the potential of combination therapy is an important strategic focus for the Merck-Pfizer Alliance," said Chris Boshoff, M.D., Ph.D., Head of Immuno-Oncology, Early Development, and Translational Oncology at Pfizer. "This collaboration with Debiopharm provides a significant opportunity to explore the potential synergistic effects of these two agents in combination." About Debio1143 Debio1143 is an oral, small molecule inhibitor of IAPs (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins) that promotes apoptosis of cancer cells by mimicking the activity of the natural Second Mitochondrial-derived Activator of Caspases (SMAC). Evasion of apoptosis is a hallmark of cancer and a common mechanism of resistance to current treatments and Debio1143 is being investigated as chemo- and radio-sensitizer in Ovarian Cancer and Head & Neck Cancer. In addition, like other members of the class, Debio1143 displays strong immunomodulatory properties that make it a natural candidate for combination with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors.

Letermovir (AIC426) is being tested for prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus (CMV) activation in patients receiving haematopoietic stem cell transplants - an indication which according to Credit Suisse forecasts could make it a $350m market by the end of the decade. Letermovir has been granted orphan drug status in the EU and the US, and has also been earmarked for fast-track review by the FDA. There is a significant need for additional medicines for the treatment of CMV infection, which is one of the most common viral infections affecting transplant patients. CMV is a herpes virus, infecting 50-90% of the adult population, with a majority remaining without symptoms. However, without preventive drugs approximately 80% of CMV-seropositive patients experience CMV infection after an allogeneic (donor) HSCT, which can lead to organ damage and symptoms such as visual impairment, pneumonia and hepatitis. Current drugs such as valganciclovir target CMV DNA polymerase and tend to be associated with poor oral bioavailability, the development of resistance and dose-limiting toxicities such as kidney damage and anaemia. Letermovir goes after another enzyme - viral terminase - and so could provide another line of therapy for resistant infections, while data from a phase II trial suggests it also has a good tolerability profile. Merck licensed the rights to develop and commercialize letermovir - along with a back-up candidate and other early-stage candidates that act against CMV via an alternate mechanism - from Germany's AiCuris in 2012. AiCuris - which was formed as a spin-out from Bayer's anti-infectives unit in 2006 - pocketed an upfront payment of €110m and - with milestone payments - could get up to €442.5m plus royalties from Merck. Merck hasn't given any details yet on the phase III trial results, saying it will submit them for presentation at a future medical conference. The company's good news comes after another CMV drug developer - Chimerix - reported that its brincidofovir CMV candidate failed a pair of pivotal trials. Other companies developing CMV-targeting drugs include Atara Biotherapeutics and ViraCyte, which have CMV-specific T-cell therapies in development, while Shire has a small-molecule drug called maribavir heading into phase III testing that it acquired along with ViroPharma in 2013. Meanwhile, Sanofi, GlaxoSmithKline/AlphaVax, Astellas, Helocyte, Vical and VBI Vaccines have preventive vaccines against the virus in clinical testing. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments.

On Wednesday, Oct. 19, 2016, a government panel said preteens need only get two doses of HPV vaccine instead of three -- a move some hope will raise languishing HPV vaccination rates. Health officials say fewer than a third of 13-year-old U.S. boys and girls get all the necessary shots to protect them against human papillomaviruses (Merck via AP) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........NEW YORK — It’s now easier for preteens to get the cervical cancer vaccine. The government on Wednesday quickly adopted a recommendation that preteens get two shots instead of three and space them further apart. Health officials hope that will boost the number of girls and boys who get vaccinated. “It will be simpler now for parents to get their kids the HPV vaccine series, and protect their kids from HPV cancers,” said Dr. Nancy Messonnier of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The vaccine protects against human papillomavirus — or HPV — which can cause cervical cancer, certain other cancers and genital warts. It is commonly spread through sex and, in most cases, the virus doesn’t cause any problems. But some infections gradually lead to cancer. Advertisement Continue reading Health officials want kids to get HPV vaccinations at age 11 or 12, well before most first have sex and before they could be infected. But less than one-third of 13-year-old U.S. boys and girls have gotten three doses. Busy parents have struggled with the old schedule, which called for three trips to the doctor within six months. “I know people who say ‘I can’t do that. Why even start?'” said Cynthia Pellegrini, a March of Dimes official who sits on the panel. Recent studies have shown two doses of the current HPV vaccine — Gardasil 9 — work just as well in kids ages 9 to 14. The Food and Drug Administration two weeks ago said it could be given in two doses. What’s more, two doses apparently work better when spaced six to 12 months apart. That means they could be given at annual checkups. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices made the recommendation at a meeting in Atlanta. The panel stuck with three doses for anyone who doesn’t get their first shot until they turn 15. That’s because they didn’t have enough data on how well two doses worked in older kids. The vaccine was first recommended in 2006 for girls, and then for boys in 2011 — partly to reduce the spread of HPV to girls. Vaccination rates have risen very slowly, and health officials have lamented the underuse of a potent cancer prevention tool. Too many doctors have been timid about promoting the shots, experts say. That’s at least partly because some parents have worried the vaccination seems like they are greenlighting their kids to have sex. But the onerous schedule sure didn’t help. “I think it was the icing on the cake” for parents already hesitant about HPV shots, said Dr. William Schaffner, a vaccines expert at Vanderbilt University. Until recently, there were three HPV vaccines on the market. Now there’s only one — Merck & Co.’s Gardasil 9. This month, the company stopped selling an older version. GlaxoSmithKline phased out its vaccine, Cervarix, in the U.S. because of poor sales. Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe More News Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

L.A.'s leading sportscaster, Derrin Horton, appears in a public service announcement designed to encourage those aged 50+ to join the online registry. Researchers are seeking a larger pool of potential participants from Southern California, including those in under-represented minority groups, with the goal of helping to accelerate the evaluation of investigational treatments for Alzheimer's disease. The Los Angeles area has six sites that are actively enrolling participants for the Amyloid Production and Effects on Cognition Study (APECS).  This study, sponsored by Merck, is evaluating the effects an investigational oral medication and its effects on the progression of early stage Alzheimer's disease. "I'm pleased to help increase participation in Alzheimer's clinical trials any way I can. This devastating disease touches the lives of so many in the Los Angeles area - patients, caregivers and families. I'm hoping that by getting the word out about clinical trials, we can speed development of potential treatments for Alzheimer's," stated Derrick Horton. Local Support – Why LA? According to a report from the Alzheimer's Association, in 2015 there were 177,000 people aged 55+ living with Alzheimer's in Los Angeles County, and is projected to increase. Los Angeles is a key research center for brain health and Alzheimer's. There are 6 sites currently enrolling in the APECS study throughout Los Angeles County. Join the Cause Those who wish to join the research efforts in the fight against Alzheimer's disease can register free at www.la.brainhealthregistry.org. How Registering with Brain Health Registry Can Help to Support Research The clinical trial process is a necessary step to researching and developing potential new treatments for Alzheimer's and any other disease. A critical part of the drug discovery process is recruiting volunteers for clinical trials. This process can sometimes take years. With more than 45,000 volunteers enrolled nationwide, the purpose of the Brain Health Registry is to build a large pool of volunteers who complete questionnaires and take cognitive tests online. Data collected from these volunteers helps scientists track brain function over time, thus enabling them to identify potential candidates for specific clinical trials and research studies.

During his inauguration speech, Frank Stangenberg-Haverkamp, Chairman of the Executive Board and Family Board of E.Merck KG emphasized “Merck is a value driven company and that is one of the reasons why Merck is committed to support the social and economic development of Africa by improving access to innovative and equitable healthcare in the continent.” Belén Garijo, Member of Executive Board and CEO of Merck Healthcare emphasized: “Merck is pleased to partner with the Ministry of Health and Government of Côte d’Ivoire to provide improved access to healthcare as part of our long term commitment to the social and economic development in this country and in Africa at large.

During the Merck Africa Luminary, Merck launched the “Merck More than a Mother” campaign for Francophone African countries. The launch took place during a high-level panel officiated by Her Excellency Madame Brigitte Touadera, the first lady of the Central African Republic. The initiative aims to empower infertile women in Africa by improving their access to information, education and healthcare, and by changing mind-sets to de-stigmatize infertility. ”I am happy to champion the “Merck More than a Mother” initiative as it seeks to expand into Francophone Africa. I believe this initiative will contribute significantly towards eliminating the social suffering and stigmatization of infertile women and raise awareness about infertility prevention, male infertility and the necessity for a team approach to family building among couples. This is very critical for my country and for Africa at large” said Madame Brigitte Touadera. At this year’s Luminary Merck also announced the start of their “Cancer Access Program”. This aims to increase the number of qualified oncologists through providing an African medical oncology fellowship program in partnership with the University of Nairobi and Tata Memorial Hospital in India.

The company is increasingly tapping into the continent’s innovative spirit to create health awareness and help respond to unmet medical needs. To underscore its commitment to Africa and in recognition of the continent’s rising importance, Merck has opened an office in Abidjan to serve as a hub for its business activities in Francophone Africa. Merck Africa Luminary is an annual forum where African healthcare providers, policy makers and researchers meet to discuss and develop different strategies and programs to build healthcare capacity and improve access to innovative and equitable healthcare solutions across the continent. The first Merck Africa Luminary was held in Darmstadt, Germany in 2014 and the second in Nairobi, Kenya in 2015.  Distributed by APO on behalf of Merck.

The dti is the custodian of key consumer and corporate regulation policy such as the Consumer Protection Act which bequeaths on South Africans eight fundamental consumer rights which businesses must uphold when they transact with consumers, and the National Regulator for Compulsory Specifications Act which forbids the sale of non-compliant products. According to the Minister of Trade and Industry, Dr Rob Davies the campaign is aimed at educating poor and vulnerable consumers about the importance of using approved appliances that comply with quality and safety and to remove non-compliant appliances from communities in and around Kimberley that pose a risk to their safety and socio-economic wellbeing. “Consumers must be aware of the laws that protect them, and should demand fair value, and good quality from retailers when they transact,” asserts Davies.  “As part of this campaign I have instructed both the NCC and the NRCS to conduct inspections at retailers in Kimberley, to seize all appliances that do not comply with their respective legislation, and to destroy them,” he added. The partnership by the respective government organisations follows an initial winter safety campaign which was kick-started in June 2015 by the NRCS and the NCC, aimed at educating consumers about the importance of using approved appliances such as paraffin stoves and heaters to prevent shack fires which often result in loss of lives and property.

Media files Download logo A statement by the UK on peaceful elections in Ghana The British Government expresses its concern at recent incidents of political violence in Ghana in the run-up to the presidential and parliamentary elections on 7 December. We condemn all violent acts by the supporters of any political party, including any occurring as a result of holding electoral campaign events close to the private homes of rival candidates. The UK is a great supporter of Ghana’s democracy and of maintaining its electoral record. We admire the open and energetic nature of its campaigns. We believe that violence has absolutely no place in the electoral process. We therefore call on all Ghana’s political actors to promote peace, and to respect Ghana’s electoral and constitutional processes. All political parties should strongly urge their supporters to refrain from, and indeed actively to condemn, any violence, incitement or intimidation which only serve to undermine democracy. The UK reserves the right to take action against anyone engaging in or inciting political violence, including considering refusing or revoking visas. The UK will continue to work with Ghanaian institutions, including the Electoral Commission, Police, Judiciary, National Peace Council, civil society groups and the media to support Ghana’s efforts to hold credible, peaceful and fair elections. The UK remains entirely neutral in those elections. Distributed by APO on behalf of British High Commission Accra.

Media files Download logo Joint op-ed by Faustin-Archange Touadéra (President of the Central African Republic), Federica Mogherini (High Representative of the European Union for Foreign and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission), Jan Eliasson (Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations), Makhtar Diop (Vice-President of the World Bank) Three years ago the Central African Republic was on the brink of collapse. But today, the country has changed course. The people of the Central African Republic have chosen to turn the page through free and democratic elections. The international community has accompanied each step of the transition, so that the crisis can be overcome for good. There is now hope for the country to embark on a journey to recovery and renewal. The main factor for this emerging success is the Central Africans themselves, their desire for peace, prosperity and security. But the international community also has a fundamental role to play. Total reconstruction needs are estimated at $1.5 billion over the next three years. At the Brussels Conference for CAR, on November 17th, we will commit together to keeping the Central African Republic at the core of the international agenda, to supporting an ambitious plan for peace and growth, and to advance the reforms the country needs in the years to come. The challenges ahead are immense. Recent tensions have shown that the road towards national reconciliation and reconstruction will still be fraught with obstacles. The security situation, while improving, remains fragile because of attempts by spoilers to incite violence. It is getting harder for humanitarian agencies to reach some 2.3 million people who remain in need – that is, half of the country’s population. More than 380,000 men, women and children are internally displaced: attacks against camps where they are sheltering, as well as attacks against humanitarian partners, have added to a dire situation. To break the cycle of fragility, the country needs long-term investments. Peace, social cohesion and national unity can only be achieved through long-term development. For this reason the Central African Republic, along with its international partners, has engaged in an unprecedented collective effort to chart a sustainable way forward for the country.   A five-year national plan for recovery and peace-building – prepared by the government together with the United Nations, the European Union and the World Bank, in consultation with the population – will be presented at the Brussels conference. This roadmap can help materialise the hopes and aspirations of the Central Africans: from peace and security to economic recovery; from improving the country’s infrastructure to the provision of essential services, such as health, sanitation and education. The programme foresees a strategy for disarmament, demobilisation, reintegration and repatriation; a much needed security and justice sector reform; and a strategy for the return of displaced people. The international community can and must support the government in the implementation of the plan. Over the last three years we have already demonstrated that together we are stronger. A UN peacekeeping mission followed an African Union-led regional force in 2014: ever since it has been protecting civilians, providing security and strengthening the national authorities. The World Bank is helping to improve public finances management, providing employment to vulnerable communities, and restoring basic services and infrastructure. The European Union has deployed the full range of its foreign policy tools, with three military missions and as the largest international provider of relief assistance. And together we are all ready to do even more in the years ahead. In Brussels we will ask our international partners to do their part and also invest in the future of CAR. We now have a far-reaching, forward-looking agenda owned by the government and the people of the Central African Republic. The return of investment will be beneficial not only to the country, but to the entire region – which is now affected by volatility and has been hosting approximately half a million refugees. The Central African Republic can be a land of opportunities. This is not simply about the country’s natural resources, or its strategic position as a hub for regional connectivity. The people of the Central African Republic want to get back to their lives and rebuild their country. The priests, the imams and the community leaders are playing a vital role in the process of national reconciliation. Sixty per cent of the country’s population is under the age of 25: there is incredible energy and desire for regeneration, but they need jobs and economic opportunities to embrace the future. On November 17th, in Brussels, we can help the people of the Central African Republic finally unleash their immense untapped potential. Distributed by APO on behalf of EU Delegation to Rwanda. Media files Download logo Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Mykkänen to visit Tanzania and Kenya Minister of Foreign Trade and Development Kai Mykkänen will visit Tanzania and Kenya on 14–19 November 2016. The two countries are Finland’s long-term partners in development cooperation but now they are hoping for more investments and trade with Finland. The Minister will be accompanied by a delegation of 24 Finnish companies and organisations. “Trade will not replace development aid but without a strong input from the private sector there is a risk that the UN global sustainable development goals will not be reached. Finland will devote particular attention to reinforcing the private sector in the partner countries because that will create new jobs, tax revenue and sustainable solutions to energy, water and other basic necessities,” Mykkänen says. The Finnish delegation will have the opportunity to showcase their solutions to ministers and state institutions in the two host countries. In Tanzania Mykkänen will also attend a forestry investment conference and inaugurate a central control room for electricity supply built in Finnish-Tanzanian cooperation. The Minister will also open a geospatial business event organised by the universities of Turku and Dar es Salaam. In Kenya Mykkänen will attend three events dealing with clean energy, water as well as construction and architecture. In both countries the Minister will also visit Finland’s development cooperation projects. “Tanzania and Kenya are among the biggest economies in East Africa with an annual growth rate of 4–7%. Kenya has succeeded in becoming a lower middle income economy, while Tanzania still has the lowest income level. The business environment has improved in both countries partly as a result of development aid. As an old development cooperation partner, Finland has good opportunities to increase trade in the East African market of 170 million consumers,” Mykkänen says. The visit is organised together with Finpro, which is part of Team Finland.

The trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of the drug, letermovir, for prevention of cytomegalovirus infection in adult recipients of a stem cell transplant. The drug was administered once daily, either in oral tablet or IV formulation, to patients and continued for about 100 days after the transplant. Cytomegalovirus is a member of the herpes virus family and remains a significant cause of viral infections in transplant recipients.

Mark Warren national frontiers Science Date of Publication: 10.19.16. 10.19.16 Time of Publication: 6:55 am. 6:55 am The Cure for Cancer Is Data—Mountains of Data Lola Dupre A few years ago Eric Schadt met a woman who had cancer. It was an aggressive form of colon cancer that had come on quickly and metastasized to her liver. She was a young war widow from Mississippi, the mother of two girls she was raising alone, and she had only the health care that her husband’s death benefits afforded her—an overburdened oncologist at a military hospital, the lowest rung on the health care ladder. The polar opposite of cutting-edge medicine. To walk into such a facility with stage 4 metastatic disease is to walk back in time to the world of the unmapped human genome, when “colon cancer” was understood to have a single cause instead of millions of causes resulting in unique variations, when treatment was the same bag of poison, whether you were in Ocean Springs, Mississippi, or Timbuktu. A time without big data, machine learning, or hope. Schadt had just started the Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology at Mount Sinai Hospital, and when he heard about the woman in Mississippi, he said, simply, “That’s exactly the kind of patient we take.” By that he meant patients for whom the current standard of care would fail, for whom the future of medicine—one in which supercomputers sift through masses of genetic data for patterns that could lead to new treatments and cures—could not arrive fast enough. Related Stories Matt Simon Genes Might Be Helping the Tasmanian Devil Fight Off Face Cancer Emma Grey Ellis and Nick Stockton You Need More Than Rat Tumors to Prove Phones Cause Cancer Gabriel Popkin The Mystery of How Cancer Cells Barrel Through Your Body Schadt isn’t a cancer specialist or even a medical doctor. He’s a mathematician and a specialist in molecular and computational biology, and he had never had a single patient in his life. Yet through his new lab at Sinai, Schadt would generate a terabyte of data on this woman’s cancer, thousands of times what she could have expected in a conventional medical setting, in the hope of finding new ways to combat it. Toward the end, Schadt would sit at her bedside, distraught. They had become close, and the scientist who had never had patients before was seeing the implications of scientific ambition and failure. She died last year. Seated at his desk at Mount Sinai, Schadt is direct and disarming. At 51, he wears a short-sleeved polo shirt and shorts everywhere he goes, even to black-tie galas or in New York winters, which gives him the unassailable air of a true eccentric, or a high-school football coach. For any medical researcher, it’s easier to be bullish when you’re publishing papers or developing drugs, layers removed from the human impact of your work. But living the effect of your work and watching someone slowly die in front of you, well, “that’s a deeper humbling than I’d ever experienced before,” Schadt says today. “We’re on this exponential growth curve, where your mind naturally projects all the way into the future, and you think: We’re going to figure this out,” he says. “In the end, we will know what all these cells are doing, what all these perturbations do. The humbling part is that as we are on this growth curve, we are continually struck by the increasing complexity that is revealed.” For a decade we’ve been talking about the potential of gene sequencing and personalized medicine, how advances in computer processing power combined with an increasingly intimate understanding of our individual genomes has put us on the threshold of an age of miracles. With enough data, the theory goes, there’s not a disease that isn’t druggable. But as Schadt has learned, it’s not enough to plumb the depths of an individual’s DNA. It requires a universe of data—exabytes worth—to detect patterns in a population, apply machine learning, find the network of mutations responsible for disease, and do something about it. The bigger these data sets become, the more accurate and powerful the models and the predictors become. You must convince the medical centers and genetic companies that collect our data to not hoard it for their own profit. The problem is getting these exabytes of genetic data. Turns out you can’t just walk up to people, millions of them, and say, “Your data, please.” You must first persuade them that you’ll only do good things with it and won’t let it fall into the wrong hands. (We do like our privacy.) You must then convince the medical centers and genetic companies that collect this data that, rather than hoard it for their own profit, they should share it so the entire research community can attain the economies of scale—the critical mass of data, individual sets eventually numbering in the millions—that Schadt and many others believe is necessary to understand the causes of diseases and engineer new treatments and cures. Right now, that volume of information is simply not available. But companies ranging from tech behemoths to biomedical startups are racing to solve these issues of scale. And Schadt wants in. If human biological complexity can be likened to an animated movie, then a hundred years ago we had about one pixel’s worth of understanding of that complexity. With a single pixel, you have no idea what the story is. But with more pixels, hundreds or thousands—or say, 1 percent of the whole in pixels—patterns and themes begin to emerge. The beginning of a narrative. This was the thinking that compelled Schadt to set up the Icahn Institute in 2011 after a decade of developing drugs for Merck. (At one point, half of Merck’s metabolic drugs, which treat ailments like heart disease, diabetes, and obesity, were derived from Schadt’s research.) In the face of widely held assumptions based on the single-gene model of disease and drug development, he came to believe that genes worked not alone but in vast networks to enable disease to penetrate our natural defenses, and we could understand these networks only through deep bioinformatic spelunking. To explore his complexity model, Schadt arrived at Mount Sinai with $150 million of financier–philanthropist Carl Icahn’s money and built a supercomputer named Minerva in the basement to analyze the thousands of genomes collected at Mount Sinai each year. He hired other quants, including Jeffrey Hammerbacher, who had created Facebook’s first-ever data team. According to an esteemed oncologist at the medical school, “All of a sudden you had all these math nerds running around, people who looked like they should be programming videogames.” “We need 100 Mount Sinais to achieve the scale required to recognize the patterns in patient data that guide you to diagnoses and treatments.” It didn’t take long for Schadt to realize that he was going to need a bigger boat. In 2014 the Icahn Institute started a joint venture with Sage Bionetworks to try to cure rare childhood diseases—cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, Tay-Sachs—170 in all. They called it the Resilience Project, and researchers set out to find individuals in the population who carried the DNA variants for those diseases but somehow, through some inoculating buffer, didn’t have the disease. In their search for these “resilient individuals,” Schadt and his team amassed a pool of genetic data from 600,000 people, then the largest such genetic study ever conducted, with data assembled from a dozen sources (23andMe, the Beijing Genomics Institute, and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, most notably). But in searching the 600,000 genomes, the researchers found potentially resilient individuals for only eight of the 170 diseases they were targeting. The study size was too small. By calculating the frequency of the disease-causing mutations in the population, Schadt and his team came to believe that the number of subjects they’d need to be useful wasn’t 600,000—it was more on the order of 10 million. For all the computational power behind the Resilience Project and what seemed like a wealth of data, Schadt still lacked the quantity and quality of patient information required to crack the genetic code behind resilience. “We need 100 Mount Sinais to achieve the scale required to recognize the patterns in patient data that guide you to diagnoses and treatments,” Schadt says. “In the five years that I’ve been here, I’ve realized that’s just not going to happen within the medical centers. They’re too isolated from each other, too competitive, and they’re not woven together into a coherent framework that enables the kind of advancements we’re seeing in nearly all other industries.” Since the major medical centers hold an effective monopoly over their patients’ data and have little economic incentive to collaborate with one another in critical research areas, Schadt says, “the disruption is gonna happen outside the medical establishment.” So that’s what Schadt is aiming to build by establishing his own genetic data company, Sema4. The New York–based venture will focus on acquiring and expanding companies that specialize in genetic testing—–think cancer-carrier screenings and noninvasive prenatal tests—in order to collect and share millions of individual data sets. On Sema4’s searchable platform, doctors will have instant access to a world of genomes to help diagnose their patients. Pharmaceutical companies will pay to use the system to find patient populations for clinical trials. And scientists, their current analytic arsenals amplified through ever more powerful computers and machine-learning algorithms, will finally possess enough genetic data to fuel ambitious research. Though a handful of tech giants are venturing into the life sciences (see “Big Bets on Biodata,” below) and the National Institutes of Health is asking for a million volunteers to create its own massive biobank, Schadt believes that Sema4 and other startups like it—Craig Venter’s Human Longevity and Patrick Soon-Shiong’s Nant-Health chief among them—are the most committed to achieving the optimal scale of genetic data. While these companies will compete with one another to collect ever greater stores of high–quality biodata, Sema4 will stand out by making its genetic library accessible and free of charge to academic medical centers and nonprofit researchers around the world. Should any of Sema4’s competitors need to harvest information from a subset of Schadt’s data populations, he says, they could simply pay to access the Sema4 search platform. Or Sema4 and other companies could join forces to assemble large data sets for ambitious endeavors like the Resilience Project—only bigger. Big Bets on Biodata How four tech heavyweights are going all-in on life science. —Gregory Barber Alphabet Using machine learning for their Baseline study, Alphabet’s Verily Life Sciences team will pore over genomic, clinical, and imaging data from thousands of healthy volunteers in the hope of better understanding what makes them healthy—knowledge that might help keep people from getting sick in the first place. IBM In the 1970s, the World Health Organization used IBM hardware to hunt down the last vestiges of smallpox. Today IBM is partnering with hospitals to funnel health data into Watson, its Jeopardy!-winning AI system. The goal is to predict disease, personalize treatment, and even power virtual medical assistants to sift through records and research. Apple Using Apple’s ResearchKit, scientists can recruit clinical study subjects en masse and collect real-time health data from participants’ iPhones. Last spring the company added CareKit, which lets Apple users share health data directly with their personal doctors. Microsoft The company is developing tiny sensors to be worn on the skin that can transmit biometric data to remote health monitors (and, potentially, large-scale data aggregators). Microsoft also just announced its plan to use machine learning and biological data to “solve” cancer. Still, Schadt argues, the problem of scale can’t be solved by companies simply pooling their data. “It’s about getting the data from the patients themselves.” Based on his experience at Mount Sinai, he’s seen a leap in recent years in the number of people who are coming around to his belief that there is more upside than down to having a physician know their genetic predisposition to certain conditions. He says that when he got to Mount Sinai in 2011, the hospital was screening a few thousand genetic samples a year. This year, they could screen up to 150,000, most of them collected from patients in the New York region, and at Sema4, Schadt says, “we intend to scale that up to 500,000 to a million samples a year.” That growth will occur by buying and expanding existing genetic testing companies all over the country, most of which are now independent from each other but under Sema4 will combine to create a massive network of genetic information governed by a uniform standard of security and consent. Schadt acknowledges that it’s no simple task to ask a person to give up their biodata to an anonymous corporation. Even though billions of public- and private-sector dollars have been spent to modernize and secure existing data networks, breaches and leaks remain a fact of life. At Sema4, patients will be told, in detail, how their data will be encrypted, anonymized, and scrubbed of identifying information (except for an encryption key). Even in the event of a breach, the chance of someone being identified and exposed is exceedingly low. There is also the issue of informed consent—the patients’ understanding and approval of the whats, hows, whys, and how longs of whatever they’re asked to endure—which impacts both the quality and the quantity of the data being collected. “There are companies today that claim access to millions of patient records,” Schadt explains. “But from the standpoint of what we intend to do, the data is meaningless. It’s often inaccurate, incomplete, and not easily linked across systems. Plus, that data doesn’t typically include access to DNA or to the genomic data generated on their DNA.” To take the example of the Resilience Project, it wasn’t simply that the universe of data was too small—it was also that the 600,000 genomes were governed under a hash of various consenting arrangements. If something vital was discovered, hundreds of thousands of participants could not be recontacted or tracked, making the data useless from a practical research standpoint. Today, most consent forms are designed to be as quick and uninformative as possible, but rather than make it easier for researchers to get high-quality data, this approach actually makes it harder. Studies have shown that the more informed the consent, the better the information, since patients are more willing to participate in follow-up exams and interviews when they appreciate the purpose of the research. (This also allows scientists to track health and wellness over time.) At Sema4, Schadt is adopting a multistage informational process—which includes a mandatory, must-pass quiz—so it will be clear that patients understand the full scope of what they’re consenting to. This will require more of a patient’s time, but Schadt is betting that as more patients understand, more of them will consent to sharing their genetic information. With this digital infrastructure in place, Schadt envisions a future in which more and more patients share not only their genomes but also medical and lifestyle information collected by monitoring devices like glucometers, blood-pressure trackers, and inhalers. The hope is that, ultimately, these increasingly sophisticated, increasingly patient-friendly tests will be so comprehensive that a patient’s microbiome can be regularly sequenced, their RNA frequently examined, and their blood cells constantly monitored for signs of trouble. The virtual monopoly that medical centers like Mount Sinai now exercise over patient data will be smashed, and researchers will finally have the masses of genetic data that the medical breakthroughs of the future require. “Can we do better for human well-being if information is more broadly accessible, where you’re leveraging the mindshare of the entire planet to evolve the models of disease?” Schadt asks. “Absolutely.” This is medicine as math, not guesswork, and every disease—even stage 4 cancer—might one day be druggable.

The government on Wednesday quickly adopted a recommendation that preteens get two shots instead of three and space them further apart. Health officials hope that will boost the number of girls and boys who get vaccinated. "It will be simpler now for parents to get their kids the HPV vaccine series, and protect their kids from HPV cancers," said Dr. Nancy Messonnier of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The vaccine protects against human papillomavirus — or HPV — which can cause cervical cancer, certain other cancers and genital warts. It is commonly spread through sex and, in most cases, the virus doesn't cause any problems. But some infections gradually lead to cancer. Health officials want kids to get HPV vaccinations at age 11 or 12, well before most first have sex and before they could be infected. But less than one-third of 13-year-old U.S. boys and girls have gotten three doses. Busy parents have struggled with the old schedule, which called for three trips to the doctor within six months. "I know people who say 'I can't do that. Why even start?'" said Cynthia Pellegrini, a March of Dimes official who sits on the panel. Recent studies have shown two doses of the current HPV vaccine — Gardasil 9 — work just as well in kids ages 9 to 14. The Food and Drug Administration two weeks ago said it could be given in two doses. What's more, two doses apparently work better when spaced six to 12 months apart. That means they could be given at annual checkups. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices made the recommendation at a meeting in Atlanta. The panel stuck with three doses for anyone who doesn't get their first shot until they turn 15. That's because they didn't have enough data on how well two doses worked in older kids. The vaccine was first recommended in 2006 for girls, and then for boys in 2011 — partly to reduce the spread of HPV to girls. Vaccination rates have risen very slowly, and health officials have lamented the underuse of a potent cancer prevention tool. Too many doctors have been timid about promoting the shots, experts say. That's at least partly because some parents have worried the vaccination seems like they are greenlighting their kids to have sex. But the onerous schedule sure didn't help. "I think it was the icing on the cake" for parents already hesitant about HPV shots, said Dr. William Schaffner, a vaccines expert at Vanderbilt University. Until recently, there were three HPV vaccines on the market. Now there's only one — Merck & Co.'s Gardasil 9. This month, the company stopped selling an older version. GlaxoSmithKline phased out its vaccine, Cervarix, in the U.S. because of poor sales.

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/files By Kate Kelland LONDON, Reuters) - The World Health Organization, drugmakers and humanitarian groups are hammering out details of a new vaccine supply system aimed at getting vital shots to vulnerable people in crises such as wars or natural disasters. The mechanism, which so far has British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline signed up to provide its pneumonia vaccine at the lowest possible price, will ask other major pharmaceutical firms including Pfizer and Merck to make similar cut-price agreements for emergencies only. "The idea is that this will set a model in place for other manufacturers to put their vaccines on the table," said Greg Elder, a medical coordinator with the international charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) which joined talks on the issue at the WHO's Geneva headquarters last week. A spokesman for the WHO said the humanitarian vaccine mechanism - which would only be used in crisis situations - could mean reaching millions of vulnerable people with protective shots against potential killers such as measles, yellow fever and pneumonia. For now, GSK has pledged to make its PCV-10 vaccine for pneumococcal infection available at its lowest possible price, he said, and other manufacturers are considering which of their shots might also be included. Signing up would mean drugmakers agreeing to supply the shots at a price equivalent to that paid by the United Nations children's fund UNICEF for vaccines supplied under the GAVI Vaccines Alliance to low and middle-income countries who can't afford to pay full price. Yet unlike GAVI, the cheaper emergency vaccines would be accessible only to non-governmental organisations such as MSF and other charities and humanitarian groups - not to health ministries or national authorities. This, said MSF's Elder, will ensure drugmakers are not exposed to having to supply large quantities of vaccines at rock-bottom prices that could dent their profits. "We're talking about a very specific cohort - refugees, displaced populations, people who have gone through a lot of trauma and have had to flee their homes," Elder said. "It's a small group of people who are caught in the middle of emergencies and can fall through the gaps. And it's a minute fraction of their (the drug companies') global market." The International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA) and the Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers Network (DCVMN), who took part in the talks "expressed great interest" and said they would take the idea to their members, according to Noni MacDonald, an immunisation specialist and professor of paediatrics at Canada's Dalhousie Medical School, who chaired the meeting. Philippe Duclos, a senior WHO expert on immunisation, said the hope is that the mechanism will ultimately cover some 23 shots against diseases ranging from cholera to rabies to polio to hepatitis to yellow fever. "Of course some vaccines are more important in certain emergencies than in others," he said. "What we need is to rationalise, quickly, in each emergency, which ones are needed." MacDonald said that while there is a way to go to agree prices and supplies, she is confident that starting with GSK's pneumococcal shot will show how the system can work for others. "It's rare to have such disparate groups come together so solidly to support the way forward," she told Reuters. "It's going to take a lot of effort and education to make this process work, but we're all agreed it's important – and failure to deliver is not an option because lives depend upon getting this done right."

Tecentriq (atezolizumab) was first approved in May for treatment of bladder cancer, an indication not yet targeted by the two PD-1 inhibitors on the market - Merck & Co's Keytruda (pembrolizumab) and Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo (nivolumab). Now, the three checkpoint inhibitors will battle toe to toe for the much larger NSCLC sector, although Roche will have to work hard to displace Opdivo and Keytruda given their long lead in the lung cancer market. The Swiss group's strong presence in cancer therapy and strong links with oncologists are however expected to help it catch the leaders, and Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson recently predicted the drug could make almost $5bn in sales in 2021 if it also picks up an approval in colon cancer. That still keeps Tecentriq in third place behind Opdivo (with predicted 2021 sales of $8.1bn) and Keytruda ($6.5bn) but ahead of AstraZeneca's PD-L1 inhibitor durvalumab ($1.8bn). The green light comes on the back of the phase III OAK trial which showed that patients treated with Roche's drug lived almost 14 months on average - around four months longer than those on docetaxel - as well as the phase II POPLAR study. Tecentriq's chances of making a strong showing in NSCLC are helped by a broad label. The FDA has cleared the drug for NSCLC patients whose disease has progressed during or after platinum-containing chemotherapy or a targeted therapy if their tumours have EGFR or ALK mutations. That gives it an equivalent label claim to Opdivo, which has been dominant in the second-line NSCLC treatment setting thanks to a broader label than Keytruda, which required that patients be tested to see if their tumours express high levels of the PD-L1 protein. The first-line NSCLC category is however developing very differently. Opdivo stumbled badly in its Checkmate-026 first-line study, while Merck's drug aced its Keynote-024 trial and is now on course for a swift approval. Roche has a phase III trial ongoing in previously-untreated NSCLC patients but this is not due to generate results until 2018. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments.

Mark Warren national frontiers Science Date of Publication: 10.19.16. 10.19.16 Time of Publication: 6:55 am. 6:55 am The Cure for Cancer Is Data—Mountains of Data Lola Dupre A few years ago Eric Schadt met a woman who had cancer. It was an aggressive form of colon cancer that had come on quickly and metastasized to her liver. She was a young war widow from Mississippi, the mother of two girls she was raising alone, and she had only the health care that her husband’s death benefits afforded her—an overburdened oncologist at a military hospital, the lowest rung on the health care ladder. The polar opposite of cutting-edge medicine. To walk into such a facility with stage 4 metastatic disease is to walk back in time to the world of the unmapped human genome, when “colon cancer” was understood to have a single cause instead of millions of causes resulting in unique variations, when treatment was the same bag of poison, whether you were in Ocean Springs, Mississippi, or Timbuktu. A time without big data, machine learning, or hope. Schadt had just started the Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology at Mount Sinai Hospital, and when he heard about the woman in Mississippi, he said, simply, “That’s exactly the kind of patient we take.” By that he meant patients for whom the current standard of care would fail, for whom the future of medicine—one in which supercomputers sift through masses of genetic data for patterns that could lead to new treatments and cures—could not arrive fast enough. Related Stories Matt Simon Genes Might Be Helping the Tasmanian Devil Fight Off Face Cancer Emma Grey Ellis and Nick Stockton You Need More Than Rat Tumors to Prove Phones Cause Cancer Gabriel Popkin The Mystery of How Cancer Cells Barrel Through Your Body Schadt isn’t a cancer specialist or even a medical doctor. He’s a mathematician and a specialist in molecular and computational biology, and he had never had a single patient in his life. Yet through his new lab at Sinai, Schadt would generate a terabyte of data on this woman’s cancer, thousands of times what she could have expected in a conventional medical setting, in the hope of finding new ways to combat it. Toward the end, Schadt would sit at her bedside, distraught. They had become close, and the scientist who had never had patients before was seeing the implications of scientific ambition and failure. She died last year. Seated at his desk at Mount Sinai, Schadt is direct and disarming. At 51, he wears a short-sleeved polo shirt and shorts everywhere he goes, even to black-tie galas or in New York winters, which gives him the unassailable air of a true eccentric, or a high-school football coach. For any medical researcher, it’s easier to be bullish when you’re publishing papers or developing drugs, layers removed from the human impact of your work. But living the effect of your work and watching someone slowly die in front of you, well, “that’s a deeper humbling than I’d ever experienced before,” Schadt says today. “We’re on this exponential growth curve, where your mind naturally projects all the way into the future, and you think: We’re going to figure this out,” he says. “In the end, we will know what all these cells are doing, what all these perturbations do. The humbling part is that as we are on this growth curve, we are continually struck by the increasing complexity that is revealed.” For a decade we’ve been talking about the potential of gene sequencing and personalized medicine, how advances in computer processing power combined with an increasingly intimate understanding of our individual genomes has put us on the threshold of an age of miracles. With enough data, the theory goes, there’s not a disease that isn’t druggable. But as Schadt has learned, it’s not enough to plumb the depths of an individual’s DNA. It requires a universe of data—exabytes worth—to detect patterns in a population, apply machine learning, find the network of mutations responsible for disease, and do something about it. The bigger these data sets become, the more accurate and powerful the models and the predictors become. You must convince the medical centers and genetic companies that collect our data to not hoard it for their own profit. The problem is getting these exabytes of genetic data. Turns out you can’t just walk up to people, millions of them, and say, “Your data, please.” You must first persuade them that you’ll only do good things with it and won’t let it fall into the wrong hands. (We do like our privacy.) You must then convince the medical centers and genetic companies that collect this data that, rather than hoard it for their own profit, they should share it so the entire research community can attain the economies of scale—the critical mass of data, individual sets eventually numbering in the millions—that Schadt and many others believe is necessary to understand the causes of diseases and engineer new treatments and cures. Right now, that volume of information is simply not available. But companies ranging from tech behemoths to biomedical startups are racing to solve these issues of scale. And Schadt wants in. If human biological complexity can be likened to an animated movie, then a hundred years ago we had about one pixel’s worth of understanding of that complexity. With a single pixel, you have no idea what the story is. But with more pixels, hundreds or thousands—or say, 1 percent of the whole in pixels—patterns and themes begin to emerge. The beginning of a narrative. This was the thinking that compelled Schadt to set up the Icahn Institute in 2011 after a decade of developing drugs for Merck. (At one point, half of Merck’s metabolic drugs, which treat ailments like heart disease, diabetes, and obesity, were derived from Schadt’s research.) In the face of widely held assumptions based on the single-gene model of disease and drug development, he came to believe that genes worked not alone but in vast networks to enable disease to penetrate our natural defenses, and we could understand these networks only through deep bioinformatic spelunking. To explore his complexity model, Schadt arrived at Mount Sinai with $150 million of financier–philanthropist Carl Icahn’s money and built a supercomputer named Minerva in the basement to analyze the thousands of genomes collected at Mount Sinai each year. He hired other quants, including Jeffrey Hammerbacher, who had created Facebook’s first-ever data team. According to an esteemed oncologist at the medical school, “All of a sudden you had all these math nerds running around, people who looked like they should be programming videogames.” “We need 100 Mount Sinais to achieve the scale required to recognize the patterns in patient data that guide you to diagnoses and treatments.” It didn’t take long for Schadt to realize that he was going to need a bigger boat. In 2014 the Icahn Institute started a joint venture with Sage Bionetworks to try to cure rare childhood diseases—cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, Tay-Sachs—170 in all. They called it the Resilience Project, and researchers set out to find individuals in the population who carried the DNA variants for those diseases but somehow, through some inoculating buffer, didn’t have the disease. In their search for these “resilient individuals,” Schadt and his team amassed a pool of genetic data from 600,000 people, then the largest such genetic study ever conducted, with data assembled from a dozen sources (23andMe, the Beijing Genomics Institute, and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, most notably). But in searching the 600,000 genomes, the researchers found potentially resilient individuals for only eight of the 170 diseases they were targeting. The study size was too small. By calculating the frequency of the disease-causing mutations in the population, Schadt and his team came to believe that the number of subjects they’d need to be useful wasn’t 600,000—it was more on the order of 10 million. For all the computational power behind the Resilience Project and what seemed like a wealth of data, Schadt still lacked the quantity and quality of patient information required to crack the genetic code behind resilience. “We need 100 Mount Sinais to achieve the scale required to recognize the patterns in patient data that guide you to diagnoses and treatments,” Schadt says. “In the five years that I’ve been here, I’ve realized that’s just not going to happen within the medical centers. They’re too isolated from each other, too competitive, and they’re not woven together into a coherent framework that enables the kind of advancements we’re seeing in nearly all other industries.” Since the major medical centers hold an effective monopoly over their patients’ data and have little economic incentive to collaborate with one another in critical research areas, Schadt says, “the disruption is gonna happen outside the medical establishment.” So that’s what Schadt is aiming to build by establishing his own genetic data company, Sema4. The New York–based venture will focus on acquiring and expanding companies that specialize in genetic testing—–think cancer-carrier screenings and noninvasive prenatal tests—in order to collect and share millions of individual data sets. On Sema4’s searchable platform, doctors will have instant access to a world of genomes to help diagnose their patients. Pharmaceutical companies will pay to use the system to find patient populations for clinical trials. And scientists, their current analytic arsenals amplified through ever more powerful computers and machine-learning algorithms, will finally possess enough genetic data to fuel ambitious research. Though a handful of tech giants are venturing into the life sciences (see “Big Bets on Biodata,” below) and the National Institutes of Health is asking for a million volunteers to create its own massive biobank, Schadt believes that Sema4 and other startups like it—Craig Venter’s Human Longevity and Patrick Soon-Shiong’s Nant-Health chief among them—are the most committed to achieving the optimal scale of genetic data. While these companies will compete with one another to collect ever greater stores of high–quality biodata, Sema4 will stand out by making its genetic library accessible and free of charge to academic medical centers and nonprofit researchers around the world. Should any of Sema4’s competitors need to harvest information from a subset of Schadt’s data populations, he says, they could simply pay to access the Sema4 search platform. Or Sema4 and other companies could join forces to assemble large data sets for ambitious endeavors like the Resilience Project—only bigger. Big Bets on Biodata How four tech heavyweights are going all-in on life science. —Gregory Barber Alphabet Using machine learning for their Baseline study, Alphabet’s Verily Life Sciences team will pore over genomic, clinical, and imaging data from thousands of healthy volunteers in the hope of better understanding what makes them healthy—knowledge that might help keep people from getting sick in the first place. IBM In the 1970s, the World Health Organization used IBM hardware to hunt down the last vestiges of smallpox. Today IBM is partnering with hospitals to funnel health data into Watson, its Jeopardy!-winning AI system. The goal is to predict disease, personalize treatment, and even power virtual medical assistants to sift through records and research. Apple Using Apple’s ResearchKit, scientists can recruit clinical study subjects en masse and collect real-time health data from participants’ iPhones. Last spring the company added CareKit, which lets Apple users share health data directly with their personal doctors. Microsoft The company is developing tiny sensors to be worn on the skin that can transmit biometric data to remote health monitors (and, potentially, large-scale data aggregators). Microsoft also just announced its plan to use machine learning and biological data to “solve” cancer. Still, Schadt argues, the problem of scale can’t be solved by companies simply pooling their data. “It’s about getting the data from the patients themselves.” Based on his experience at Mount Sinai, he’s seen a leap in recent years in the number of people who are coming around to his belief that there is more upside than down to having a physician know their genetic predisposition to certain conditions. He says that when he got to Mount Sinai in 2011, the hospital was screening a few thousand genetic samples a year. This year, they could screen up to 150,000, most of them collected from patients in the New York region, and at Sema4, Schadt says, “we intend to scale that up to 500,000 to a million samples a year.” That growth will occur by buying and expanding existing genetic testing companies all over the country, most of which are now independent from each other but under Sema4 will combine to create a massive network of genetic information governed by a uniform standard of security and consent. Schadt acknowledges that it’s no simple task to ask a person to give up their biodata to an anonymous corporation. Even though billions of public- and private-sector dollars have been spent to modernize and secure existing data networks, breaches and leaks remain a fact of life. At Sema4, patients will be told, in detail, how their data will be encrypted, anonymized, and scrubbed of identifying information (except for an encryption key). Even in the event of a breach, the chance of someone being identified and exposed is exceedingly low. There is also the issue of informed consent—the patients’ understanding and approval of the whats, hows, whys, and how longs of whatever they’re asked to endure—which impacts both the quality and the quantity of the data being collected. “There are companies today that claim access to millions of patient records,” Schadt explains. “But from the standpoint of what we intend to do, the data is meaningless. It’s often inaccurate, incomplete, and not easily linked across systems. Plus, that data doesn’t typically include access to DNA or to the genomic data generated on their DNA.” To take the example of the Resilience Project, it wasn’t simply that the universe of data was too small—it was also that the 600,000 genomes were governed under a hash of various consenting arrangements. If something vital was discovered, hundreds of thousands of participants could not be recontacted or tracked, making the data useless from a practical research standpoint. Today, most consent forms are designed to be as quick and uninformative as possible, but rather than make it easier for researchers to get high-quality data, this approach actually makes it harder. Studies have shown that the more informed the consent, the better the information, since patients are more willing to participate in follow-up exams and interviews when they appreciate the purpose of the research. (This also allows scientists to track health and wellness over time.) At Sema4, Schadt is adopting a multistage informational process—which includes a mandatory, must-pass quiz—so it will be clear that patients understand the full scope of what they’re consenting to. This will require more of a patient’s time, but Schadt is betting that as more patients understand, more of them will consent to sharing their genetic information. With this digital infrastructure in place, Schadt envisions a future in which more and more patients share not only their genomes but also medical and lifestyle information collected by monitoring devices like glucometers, blood-pressure trackers, and inhalers. The hope is that, ultimately, these increasingly sophisticated, increasingly patient-friendly tests will be so comprehensive that a patient’s microbiome can be regularly sequenced, their RNA frequently examined, and their blood cells constantly monitored for signs of trouble. The virtual monopoly that medical centers like Mount Sinai now exercise over patient data will be smashed, and researchers will finally have the masses of genetic data that the medical breakthroughs of the future require. “Can we do better for human well-being if information is more broadly accessible, where you’re leveraging the mindshare of the entire planet to evolve the models of disease?” Schadt asks. “Absolutely.” This is medicine as math, not guesswork, and every disease—even stage 4 cancer—might one day be druggable.

The mechanism, which so far has British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline signed up to provide its pneumonia vaccine at the lowest possible price, will ask other major pharmaceutical firms including Pfizer and Merck to make similar cut-price agreements for emergencies only. "The idea is that this will set a model in place for other manufacturers to put their vaccines on the table," said Greg Elder, a medical coordinator with the international charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) which joined talks on the issue at the WHO's Geneva headquarters last week.

FDA expands use of Pfizer's best-selling pneumonia vaccine UNICEF clinches vaccine deal to protect children from five diseases Congo, Angola begin mass vaccination drive against yellow fever A spokesman for the WHO said the humanitarian vaccine mechanism - which would only be used in crisis situations - could mean reaching millions of vulnerable people with protective shots against potential killers such as measles, yellow fever and pneumonia. For now, GSK has pledged to make its PCV-10 vaccine for pneumococcal infection available at its lowest possible price, he said, and other manufacturers are considering which of their shots might also be included. Signing up would mean drugmakers agreeing to supply the shots at a price equivalent to that paid by the United Nations children's fund UNICEF for vaccines supplied under the GAVI Vaccines Alliance to low and middle-income countries who can't afford to pay full price. Yet unlike GAVI, the cheaper emergency vaccines would be accessible only to non-governmental organizations such as MSF and other charities and humanitarian groups - not to health ministries or national authorities. This, said MSF's Elder, will ensure drugmakers are not exposed to having to supply large quantities of vaccines at rock-bottom prices that could dent their profits. "We're talking about a very specific cohort - refugees, displaced populations, people who have gone through a lot of trauma and have had to flee their homes," Elder said. "It's a small group of people who are caught in the middle of emergencies and can fall through the gaps. And it's a minute fraction of their (the drug companies') global market." The International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA) and the Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers Network (DCVMN), who took part in the talks "expressed great interest" and said they would take the idea to their members, according to Noni MacDonald, an immunization specialist and professor of pediatrics at Canada's Dalhousie Medical School, who chaired the meeting. Philippe Duclos, a senior WHO expert on immunization, said the hope is that the mechanism will ultimately cover some 23 shots against diseases ranging from cholera to rabies to polio to hepatitis to yellow fever. "Of course some vaccines are more important in certain emergencies than in others," he said. "What we need is to rationalize, quickly, in each emergency, which ones are needed." MacDonald said that while there is a way to go to agree prices and supplies, she is confident that starting with GSK's pneumococcal shot will show how the system can work for others. "It's rare to have such disparate groups come together so solidly to support the way forward," she told Reuters. "It's going to take a lot of effort and education to make this process work, but we're all agreed it's important - and failure to deliver is not an option because lives depend upon getting this done right."

Debiopharm International SA Announces Clinical Collaboration with the Merck-Pfizer Alliance in Cancer Immunotherapy Debiopharm International SA Announces Clinical Collaboration with the Merck-Pfizer Alliance in Cancer Immunotherapy PR NEWSWIRE Tweet Condividi su WhatsApp Pubblicato il: 20/10/2016 14:01 LAUSANNE, Switzerland, October 20, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- This joint effort will initially focus on aPhase I/Ib trialin patients withLung Cancerto assess safety and preliminary efficacyofDebio 1143 in combination with avelumab  Debiopharm International (Debiopharm - http://www.debiopharm.com) today announced that it has entered into a collaboration agreement with Merck and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) to evaluate Debio 1143, an oral, small molecule inhibitor of IAPs (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins), in combination with avelumab, an investigational fully human anti-PD-L1 IgG1 monoclonal antibody, in patients with advanced or metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Debio 1143 is currently in Phase II development for Head & Neck and Ovarian Cancer. Avelumab is under clinical investigation across a broad range of tumor types by the Merck-Pfizer Alliance. Under the terms of the agreement, Debiopharm will be responsible for conducting the Phase I/Ib clinical trial in NSCLC. "We are delighted to initiate this collaboration in immuno-oncology with the Merck-Pfizer Alliance. It is a great opportunity to explore in the clinic the immunomodulatory properties of Debio 1143 observed in preclinical studies," said Dr Chris Freitag, Vice President, Clinical Research & Development, Debiopharm International SA. "We are hopeful that the immunosensitizing effect of our compound in combination with avelumab may translate into a potentially better treatment outcome for patients suffering from this major debilitating disease." Globally, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women, responsible for more deaths than colon, breast and prostate cancer combined. [ 1 ] NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for 80-85% of all lung cancers. [ 2 ] The 5-year survival rate for people diagnosed with late-stage lung cancer that has spread (metastasized) to other areas of the body is 4%. [ 3 ] "Inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has shown promising activity in patients with advanced NSCLC," said Alise Reicin, M.D., Head of Global Clinical Development in the biopharma business of Merck. "We hope that our exploration of avelumab as a combination therapy with Debio 1143 will generate results that could potentially one day make a real difference to patients fighting this deadly cancer." "Investigating the potential of combination therapy is an important strategic focus for the Merck-Pfizer Alliance," said Chris Boshoff, M.D., Ph.D., Head of Immuno-Oncology, Early Development, and Translational Oncology at Pfizer. "This collaboration with Debiopharm provides a significant opportunity to explore the potential synergistic effects of these two agents in combination." AboutDebio 1143  Debio 1143 is an oral, small molecule inhibitor of IAPs (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins) that promotes apoptosis of cancer cells by mimicking the activity of the natural Second Mitochondrial-derived Activator of Caspases (SMAC). Evasion of apoptosis is a hallmark of cancer and a common mechanism of resistance to current treatments and Debio 1143 is being investigated as chemo- and radio-sensitizer in Ovarian Cancer and Head & Neck Cancer. In addition, like other members of the class, Debio 1143 displays strong immunomodulatory properties that make it a natural candidate for combination with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors. About Avelumab  Avelumab (also known as MSB0010718C) is an investigational, fully human antibody specific for a protein found on tumor cells called PD-L1, or programmed death ligand-1. Avelumab is thought to have a dual mechanism of action which may enable the immune system to find and attack cancer cells. By binding to PD-L1, avelumab is thought to prevent tumor cells from using PD-L1 for protection against white blood cells such as T-cells, exposing them to anti-tumor responses. Avelumab is also thought to help white blood cells such as natural killer (NK) cells find and attack tumors in a process known as ADCC, or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In November 2014, Merck, the science and technology company, and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab. About Debiopharm International SA  Debiopharm Group™ is a Swiss-based global biopharmaceutical group of five companies active in the development and manufacture of drugs and diagnostics tools. Debiopharm focuses on developing prescription drugs that target unmet medical needs. The group in-licenses and develops promising drug candidates.

More by Marie McCullough HIV antibody treatment shows promise, but has a ways to go Nov 11 Simple mineral could be cure for complex disease Nov 11 Cancer network campaigns to prevent deadly chemotherapy error Nov 10 More from Marie McCullough Arrow icon In a move that could boost HPV vaccination rates, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday said younger adolescents need only two doses of the vaccine, rather than three as previously recommended. The human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV), introduced a decade ago, was hailed as a breakthrough in cancer prevention because it wards off infection with sexually-transmitted strains of the virus that cause cervical cancer and some rarer head, neck and genital cancers.  But doctors and parents of adolescents have been slow to embrace the immunization, put off by its novelty, link to sexual activity, and the complexity of the three-shot regimen, which is covered by insurance. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which counsels the CDC on vaccinations, voted to Wednesday to make the change to two doses. CDC director Tom Frieden accepted the recommendation hours later. The change fits with the Food and Drug Administration's approval earlier this month of a 2-dose schedule for younger adolescents who get the improved version of Merck's Gardasil vaccine. The new version protects against nine cancer-causing strains of HPV (the original protected against four) plus strains that cause genital warts. Gardasil is the most widely used HPV vaccine, but GlaxoSmithKline markets Cervarix, which does not protect against genital warts. Under the new schedule, the first of two shots of the HPV vaccine should be administered to boys and girls at ages 11 or 12, although it could be given as early as age 9, as under the previous guidance. The second shot would be given six to 12 months after the first shot. The new recommendation says young people who get vaccinated between ages 15 and 26 should continue to get three shots to build an adequate immune response against the virus. HPV vaccination rates have been improving, but remain far below that of other childhood vaccines. Last year, about half of boys and 63 percent of girls ages 13 to 17 had gotten at least one HPV shot. Only 13 percent of boys and 37 percent of boys had gotten all three doses. “By reducing the number of doses needed to complete HPV vaccination, it should lead to an increase in the percentage of eligible boys and girls who get vaccinated,” said Douglas Lowy, acting director of the National Cancer Institute. Lowy and his NCI colleague John Schiller developed the technology that underlies the HPV vaccine. The CDC says that about 80 million Americans are infected with HPV; in most cases, the immune system clears the infection. Still, more than 38,000 cases of HPV-associated cancers occur in the United States every year. The Washington Post contributed to this report.

Vaccines against the human papillomavirus, or HPV, Merck & Co Inc's Gardasil and GlaxoSmithKline Plc's Cervarix, have been available for years, but acceptance by the public has been slow. "Safe, effective, and long-lasting protection against HPV cancers with two visits instead of three means more Americans will be protected from cancer," CDC Director Tom Frieden said in a statement. "This recommendation will make it simpler for parents to get their children protected in time." The CDC now recommends that 11- to 12-year-olds receive two doses of HPV vaccine at least six months apart. Adolescents aged 13 and 14 can also receive the two-dose schedule, but teens and young adults who start the series later, at ages 15 through 26 years, will continue to need three doses, the agency said. HPV is among the most common sexually transmitted diseases. Most infections do not cause symptoms and go away on their own, but the virus is still a leading cause of cancer deaths among women worldwide. Since the virus can also cause genital warts and cancers of the anus and mouth/throat, the vaccine is recommended for both sexes. In the United States, the HPV vaccine is recommended for children aged 11 or 12, with the goal of protecting them against the virus before they become sexually active, and also for teens and young adults who may not have previously been vaccinated.

The global, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of letermovir for the prevention of clinically-significant cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in adult (18 years and older) CMV-seropositive recipients of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). MSD will present top line results from this study at an upcoming scientific conference. Since foundation in 2006, AiCuris has been developing letermovir through phase II studies prior to licensing the antiviral medicine to MSD in 2012. Dr. Holger Zimmermann, CEO of AiCuris Anti-infective Cures GmbH comments: "The positive outcome of this study is an important milestone for our company. It's a long journey with many challenges to develop new drugs. Today's news validates our scientific expertise and our capabilities to discover and develop new therapies. These results make me proud of our team, which has worked hard for many years with great commitment and dedication and I am very thankful for the confidence our investors place in us." Dr. Thomas Strüngmann, who, together with his brother has been the main investor in the Company, is very pleased with the AiCuris team about these positive results. "Taking such long term investment strategies is often considered risky. We look forward to further good news from the other projects of our Company's pipeline." Thomas wants also to take the opportunity to thank Bayer for the good long-term relationship and trust when he took over the anti-infective spin-out which became AiCuris. Prof. Dr. Helga Rübsamen-Schaeff, the founding CEO of AiCuris Anti-infective Cures GmbH and current Chair of the Scientific Advisory Board, noted: "The letermovir program is a good example of our dedicated research and development strategy, which over many years was committed to finding novel mechanisms of action against CMV. This resulted in the innovative chemical molecule under investigation, letermovir, which targets the viral terminase protein. I am very happy that the pivotal phase III study with letermovir met its primary endpoint." AiCuris received a EUR110 million upfront payment in 2012 under the licensing agreement with MSD, and under the terms of the agreement, will receive future payments if specific milestones are achieved as well as post approval and market launch royalty payments. Please follow the link to the news release issued today by MSD: http://www.mercknewsroom.com/news-release/corporate-news/merck-announces-piv otal-phase-3-study-letermovir-investigational-antivir [1] *About Letermovir* Letermovir is an investigational once-daily antiviral medicine under development for the prevention of CMV infection and disease. It is a member of a new class of non-nucleoside CMV inhibitors (3,4 dihydro-quinazolines) and inhibits viral replication by targeting the viral terminase complex. Letermovir has been granted orphan designation by the European Medicines Agency, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for the prevention of CMV infection and disease in at-risk populations. Letermovir also has been granted Fast Track designation by the FDA. In 2012, AiCuris granted worldwide rights to further develop and commercialize letermovir (AIC246) to MSD after successful completion of a clinical phase IIb trial. *About HCMV* The Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is widely spread in the human population and represents an important pathogen for immunocompromised individuals. HCMV infection is characterized by fever, leucopenia (very low white blood cell count) and thrombocytopenia (very low platelet numbers) with or without specific organ dysfunction. Two main strategies to prevent HCMV infection have been adopted: anti-HCMV drug prophylaxis or pre-emptive treatment of transplant recipients who are at risk and have evidence of HCMV infection upon screening. *About AiCuris Anti-infective Cures GmbH* AiCuris was founded in 2006 as a spin-off from Bayer and focuses on the discovery and development of drugs against infectious diseases. The company's majority investor is SANTO Holding. The company is developing drugs for the treatment of viruses such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and adenovirus. In the field of antibacterials, AiCuris seeks to develop innovative treatment options for life-threatening, (multidrug-)resistant hospital-treated pathogens. In 2012, AiCuris signed a license agreement with MSD, one of the largest agreements of its kind in the European biotech industry. The agreement covers the development and commercialization of novel drug candidates against HCMV. Letermovir, the most advanced compound under this agreement, met the primary endpoint in a pivotal phase III clinical trial in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation. *Contact:* *Media Relations* AiCuris Anti-infective Cures MC Services AG GmbH Katja Woestenhemke Anne Hennecke Friedrich-Ebert-Str. 475/Geb.

By Mike Stobbe / Associated Press NEW YORK — It’s now easier for preteens to get the cervical cancer vaccine. The government on Wednesday quickly adopted a recommendation that preteens get two shots instead of three and space them further apart. Health officials hope that will boost the number of girls and boys who get vaccinated. “It will be simpler now for parents to get their kids the HPV vaccine series, and protect their kids from HPV cancers,” said Nancy Messonnier of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The vaccine protects against human papillomavirus — or HPV — which can cause cervical cancer, certain other cancers and genital warts. It is commonly spread through sex and, in most cases, the virus doesn’t cause any problems. But some infections gradually lead to cancer. Health officials want kids to get HPV vaccinations at age 11 or 12, well before most first have sex and before they could be infected. But less than one-third of 13-year-old U.S. boys and girls have gotten three doses. Busy parents have struggled with the old schedule, which called for three trips to the doctor within six months. “I know people who say, ‘I can’t do that. Why even start?’ ” said Cynthia Pellegrini, a March of Dimes official who sits on the panel. Recent studies have shown two doses of the current HPV vaccine — Gardasil 9 — work just as well in kids ages 9 to 14. The Food and Drug Administration two weeks ago said it could be given in two doses. What’s more, two doses apparently work better when spaced six to 12 months apart. That means they could be given at annual checkups. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices made the recommendation at a meeting in Atlanta. The panel stuck with three doses for anyone who doesn’t get their first shot until they turn 15. That’s because it didn’t have enough data on how well two doses worked in older kids. The vaccine was first recommended in 2006 for girls, and then for boys in 2011 — partly to reduce the spread of HPV to girls. Vaccination rates have risen very slowly, and health officials have lamented the underuse of a potent cancer prevention tool. Too many doctors have been timid about promoting the shots, experts say. That’s at least partly because some parents have worried the vaccination seems like they are greenlighting their kids to have sex. But the onerous schedule sure didn’t help. “I think it was the icing on the cake” for parents already hesitant about HPV shots, said William Schaffner, a vaccines expert at Vanderbilt University. Until recently, there were three HPV vaccines on the market. Now there’s only one — Merck & Co.‘s Gardasil 9. This month, the company stopped selling an older version. GlaxoSmithKline phased out its vaccine, Cervarix, in the U.S. because of poor sales. In other news, the CDC on Wednesday also reported that infections from three sexually spread diseases — chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis — reached another new high last year. Chlamydia was the most common. More than 1.5 million cases were reported in the U.S. last year, up 6 percent from the year before. Nearly 400,000 gonorrhea cases were reported, up 13 percent. And there were about 24,000 cases of the most contagious forms of syphilis, up 19 percent. The three infections are treatable with antibiotics. Officials at the CDC say part of the growth may be due to better testing and diagnosis, but much of it is a real increase. They’re not sure why.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Laurie McGinley October 19 Follow @lauriemcginley2 A doctor in Chicago holds the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine Gardasil. (Charles Rex Arbogast/AP) Children who start getting vaccinated against human papillomavirus before 15 need only two doses, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention decided Wednesday. Its previous recommendation was for a three-shot regimen, but studies have shown that two doses work just as well. Experts predict that the simpler, more flexible timeline will result in higher rates of HPV vaccination, which has lagged among both girls and boys. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which counsels the CDC on the nation’s vaccine schedule, voted Wednesday for the change. Several hours later, CDC Director Tom Frieden accepted the panel's action. Under the new schedule, the first of two doses of the HPV vaccine should be administered at 11 or 12, although it could be given as early as 9, as under the previous guidance. The second dose would be administered six to 12 months after the first dose. [Cancer doctors press pediatricians and parents to have children vaccinated with the HPV vaccine] The new recommendation does not apply to adolescents who begin getting vaccinated after they turn 15. They should still get three shots over a six-month period, the panel said. The HPV vaccine prevents cervical, vaginal, anal, and head and neck cancers, as well as precancerous lesions and genital warts. The most widely used vaccine is Gardasil, manufactured by Merck. The rate of HPV inoculation, while increasing in the past year or so, remains below that of other childhood vaccines. Last year, for example, about half of boys ages 13 to 17 had gotten at least one of the recommended three doses, while about 63 percent of girls had gotten at least one dose, according to the CDC. Cancer experts and public health officials hope a two-shot regimen will boost those figures. “By reducing the number of doses needed to complete HPV vaccination, it should lead to an increase in the percentage of eligible boys and girls who get vaccinated,” said Douglas Lowy, acting director of the National Cancer Institute. Lowy and his NCI colleague John Schiller developed the technology that underlies the HPV vaccine. The CDC says that about 80 million Americans are infected with HPV; in most cases, the immune system clears the infection. Still, more than 38,000 cases of HPV-associated cancers occur in the United States every year. The vaccine is recommended for preteens to ensure protection before they are potentially exposed to the virus by sexual contact. Approved more than a decade ago, it has long been controversial. Some critics have raised safety concerns, while others have suggested that inoculating preteens and adolescents might encourage them to become sexually active early. Subsequent research, however, has shown both issues to be groundless. Here's why the Center for Disease Control is pushing the flu shot this year.

"Following" : "Follow"}} October 19, 2016 12:38pm   Comments Share: Related MS Todd Gordon's Morgan Stanley Trade: Election Volatility Technical Alert: Morgan Stanley Tests Resistance Regional Banks Dominate New Highs; Argan, Airgain Break Out (Investor's Business Daily) Another morning and another big bank with a blowout earnings report. But the overall market doesn’t seem to be getting much of a boost from the news. This time the bank is Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS), which reported a sharp jump in trading revenue, following in the path of other banks reporting so far. While MS took center stage first thing, it looks to be a busy day in the markets, with a string of earnings reports, the Fed’s Beige Book release, and Fed speakers on the prowl. Stocks were just a little above unchanged early. Each of the major banks reporting so far this earnings season came in with big leaps in trading revenue, and MS was no exception. Bond trading at MS rose 61%, and it appears the business got a lift from demand centered around a possible Fed rate hike and concerns about the effects of Brexit. Overall, MS reported earnings of 81 cents a share, easily surpassing Wall Street analyst consensus of 63 cents. Revenue climbed 15% to $8.91 billion, compared with projections of $8.13 billion. Financials continue to do well, and that includes regional banks, too, with U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB) also reporting earnings that exceeded expectations early Wednesday. Fixed income trading is adding to banks’ bottom lines after many years of struggle, and that may be a good sign not just for big banks but for market participants overall. After the close Wednesday, stay on the lookout for more earnings from some key companies, (see below). About 20% of S&P 500 companies report this week, so this week and next really represent the true heart of earnings season. Investors may want to look beyond earnings today to monitor what Fed officials have to say. San Francisco Fed President John Williams is scheduled to speak about diversity in the financial system in Newark, N.J., at 8:45 a.m. ET, while Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan will make a speech in Fort Worth, Texas, at 1:30 p.m. On Wednesday evening, New York Fed President William Dudley will speak in New York. Odds of a December rate hike remained at close to 70% early Wednesday, according to Fed funds futures at the CME Group. And don’t forget to keep an eye out for overseas central bank news Thursday, when the European Central Bank (ECB) holds a meeting to discuss its monetary policy program. The Fed is scheduled to release its Beige Book at 2 p.m. ET today, offering a look at how U.S. regional economies are performing. The thing to look for there is whether we’re seeing a consistent message in terms of business conditions improving. Crude oil futures stayed above $50 a barrel after the American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a 3.8 million barrel decline in U.S. crude supplies for the week ended Oct. 14. That was in contrast to analysts’ estimates for a rise of 2.5 million barrels, MarketWatch reported, and may reinforce concerns expressed by some analysts earlier this week that supplies aren’t rising as quickly as normal heading into the last months of the year. Nevertheless, crude didn’t seem to be giving the stock market much of a boost, despite the correlation being back between crude and the S&P 500 Index (SPX). The Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) weekly supply data is scheduled for later today. In the energy sector, Halliburton Company (NYSE: HAL) reported better than expected earnings, which could mean that stronger crude oil prices may improve prospects for energy companies overall, something to watch as earnings season continues. Health Care In Recovery Room: The embattled health care sector, the weakest-performing sector year to date with a 3.6% loss, was back on its feet Tuesday, jumping more than 1% to lead all sectors thanks in part to earnings results from some big names. Among these were UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE: UNH) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ). Both exceeded analysts’ expectations, and UNH got a particular boost from the strong performance of its health benefits business. JNJ reported strong sales of its pharmaceutical products and raised guidance. Other than these two, and Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT), which reports Wednesday, this week seems relatively quiet from the health care earnings standpoint. Investors with their eyes on health care may want to stay tuned for next week, with earnings from Baxter International Inc (NYSE: BAX) and Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) scheduled for Tuesday. Health care has been under pressure lately, in part due to the coming presidential election. Concerns are building about how each candidate might change health policy if they win. Biotech has been especially hard hit the last few weeks. Earnings to Watch Wednesday and Later This Week: This afternoon, stay on the lookout for earnings from some consumer names, including eBay Inc (NASDAQ: EBAY), Mattel, Inc. (NASDAQ: MAT), and American Express Company (NYSE: AXP). The early earnings news has been dominated by financials, but now we may start getting a look at how consumers did during the quarter. One of the bigger companies catering directly to consumers is McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE: MCD), and that behemoth reports before the open Friday. Another key company with earnings on the way later this week is General Electric Company (NYSE: GE), also on Friday morning. Analysts polled by Briefing.com now expect MCD to exceed its year ago earnings per share, with the consensus estimate at $1.48, vs. $1.40 a year ago. But analysts see GE’s earnings per share dropping to 30 cents, down from 32 cents a year ago. Inflation Stays Muted; What are Rate Implications? Though it was almost lost amid all the earnings reports this week, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for September came out Tuesday basically as analysts had expected, showing 0.3% growth overall but only 0.1% for core CPI excluding energy and food. Seeing the total figure go up 0.3% is no surprise, because energy prices rose last month. Looking at the core figure, it’s on the positive side of the ledger, which is good from the Fed’s perspective, but perhaps still not as high as the Fed might like. And the core reading was actually down from August’s 0.3%. The Fed has said its target is for 2% annual inflation growth, though it also monitors inflation indicators other than CPI. The overall CPI was up 1.5% year over year in September, the biggest year-over-year jump in nearly two years. And core CPI rose 2.2% year-over-year. What do these inflation figures mean when it comes to interest rates? It might be interesting to see if today’s Fed speakers have anything to say on the topic.   TD Ameritrade and all third parties mentioned are separate and unaffiliated companies, and are not responsible for each other’s policies or services.

The government on Wednesday quickly adopted a recommendation that preteens get two shots instead of three and space them further apart. Health officials hope that will boost the number of girls and boys who get vaccinated. "It will be simpler now for parents to get their kids the HPV vaccine series, and protect their kids from HPV cancers," said Dr. Nancy Messonnier of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This image made available by Merck in October 2016 shows a vial and package for their GARDASIL 9 human papillomavirus vaccine. On Wednesday, Oct. 19, 2016, a government panel said preteens need only get two doses of HPV vaccine instead of three _ a move some hope will raise languishing HPV vaccination rates. Health officials say fewer than a third of 13-year-old U.S. boys and girls get all the necessary shots to protect them against human papillomaviruses (Merck via AP) The vaccine protects against human papillomavirus — or HPV — which can cause cervical cancer, certain other cancers and genital warts. It is commonly spread through sex and, in most cases, the virus doesn't cause any problems. But some infections gradually lead to cancer. Health officials want kids to get HPV vaccinations at age 11 or 12, well before most first have sex and before they could be infected. But less than one-third of 13-year-old U.S. boys and girls have gotten three doses. Busy parents have struggled with the old schedule, which called for three trips to the doctor within six months. "I know people who say 'I can't do that. Why even start?'" said Cynthia Pellegrini, a March of Dimes official who sits on the panel. Recent studies have shown two doses of the current HPV vaccine — Gardasil 9 — work just as well in kids ages 9 to 14. The Food and Drug Administration two weeks ago said it could be given in two doses. What's more, two doses apparently work better when spaced six to 12 months apart. That means they could be given at annual checkups. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices made the recommendation at a meeting in Atlanta. The panel stuck with three doses for anyone who doesn't get their first shot until they turn 15. That's because they didn't have enough data on how well two doses worked in older kids. The vaccine was first recommended in 2006 for girls, and then for boys in 2011 — partly to reduce the spread of HPV to girls. Vaccination rates have risen very slowly, and health officials have lamented the underuse of a potent cancer prevention tool. Too many doctors have been timid about promoting the shots, experts say. That's at least partly because some parents have worried the vaccination seems like they are greenlighting their kids to have sex. But the onerous schedule sure didn't help. "I think it was the icing on the cake" for parents already hesitant about HPV shots, said Dr. William Schaffner, a vaccines expert at Vanderbilt University. Until recently, there were three HPV vaccines on the market. Now there's only one — Merck & Co.'s Gardasil 9. This month, the company stopped selling an older version. GlaxoSmithKline phased out its vaccine, Cervarix, in the U.S. because of poor sales. Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Tecentriq to be used in non-small cell lung cancer patients previously treated with chemotherapy, regardless of whether their tumors express a protein called PD-L1. People with high PD-L1 levels are generally more receptive to immunotherapy. In study results released this month, patients getting Tecentriq lived on average 4.2 months longer than those taking chemotherapy. Tecentriq is aiming for a share of the treatment market now dominated by Bristol's Opdivo, a drug which doctors can also prescribe for patients regardless of their levels of immune-system suppressing PD-L1 expression. In the first half, Opdivo sales hit $1.58 billion, about three times that of Merck & Co's drug, Keytruda, that is prescribed only for people who express a certain level of PD-L1. More on this... Immunotherapy drug sustains father of 5 living with stage 4 bladder cancer Roche therapy helps 24 percent of untreated bladder cancer patients: study Georgia man to complete half Ironman as he battles incurable lung cancer Analysts estimate Tecentriq's annual sales across all cancers - it is already approved for bladder cancer and will seek approval for more indications - will reach $4 billion in 2021, according to consensus figures compiled by Thomson Reuters. Tecentriq, Opdivo and Keytruda are the initial entrants in a highly promising class of immunotherapy drugs now transforming cancer treatment and are jockeying for pole position, either for use alone or in combination with other drugs. Lung cancer, responsible for 20 percent of the annual 8 million annual cancer deaths worldwide, is the top commercial opportunity.

By David Dayen October 19, 2016 Last Friday, Bernie Sanders held a rally in a parking lot across the street from a Hollywood studio. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were not mentioned, nor was any other politician on the 2016 ballot. Sanders was there as part of an effort to lower runaway prescription drug prices. “The pharmaceutical industry has become a major health hazard to the American people!” Sanders thundered in front of about 500 supporters. “This is the most significant proposition in the country today to end pharmaceutical greed.” Bernie’s crusade is known as Prop 61, and it manages to be both modest and earth-shaking, a minor element in reforming drug-purchasing that would set a critical precedent to stop price-gouging by Big Pharma. If the referendum is passed this November, the majority of Californians will see no relief other than as taxpayers; their drug prices might even rise as an indirect result. But at a time when Americans are deeply concerned about the cost of medicine, any measure with the potential to alleviate the burdens of the current system deserves support. Written by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, Prop 61 would require state agencies in California that make prescription drug purchases to only pay what the Department of Veterans Affairs pays. The VA enjoys the lowest prices for drugs in the nation, in part because it is protected by a federal law that prohibits it from paying above 76 percent of the average wholesale price. Polls show significant support for Prop 61, but that’s before gauging the full impact of a drug industry opposition campaign that could total $100 million, making this one of the costliest ballot measures in California history. If Prop 61 were passed, it would affect a fairly small population. California purchases drugs for current and retired state employees, students at public universities, prison inmates, and low-income beneficiaries of Medi-Cal, the state Medicaid program. However, Medi-Cal managed care plans, which serve 75 percent of all enrollees, are exempt from the rule (probably because the AIDS Healthcare Foundation runs a Medi-Cal managed care program itself). So while California spent $3.8 billion on prescription drugs in the 2014-2015 fiscal year, Prop 61 would cover less than that. Furthermore, the savings are hard to model. The VA does not publicly disclose how much it pays for medications; it’s assumed that it gets additional discounts beyond the federal ceiling, but nobody knows how much on every drug. State agencies would have to file a Freedom of Information Act request just to know how much to charge the drug companies, and the VA could invoke a trade secret or financial information exemption. Furthermore, the VA has a limited formulary, while Medi-Cal must offer any drug approved by the FDA. On those drugs that the VA doesn’t buy, Prop 61 will have no effect. Then there’s the fear that drug companies will compensate for their losses by raising drug prices on ordinary Californians or the VA, a prospect that has led most major veterans groups to oppose Prop 61. This response is a bit overblown, given the unknown effect of Prop 61 and the fact that the VA represents only 2 to 3 percent of pharmaceutical sales. But practically every “No on 61” ad has a spokesman in full military uniform—and you don’t discover until the end that the ad is funded by Pfizer and Merck. But there are a couple reasons Prop 61 has received high-level support from folks like Sanders. First, the measure would set a precedent that governments have the power to lower prescription drug prices. This is already standard in virtually every industrialized nation, but the United States has followed a weird hands-off policy, giving drug companies carte blanche to gouge customers for life-saving medications. The Valeant, Mylan, and Turing Pharmaceuticals scandals this year show what a misguided choice that has been. We don’t let Medicare negotiate prescription drug prices, and we don’t allow re-importation of drugs from abroad that are often made in the same factories as the ones offered domestically. We deliberately fragment the purchasing pool—splitting them into veterans and civilians, for example—to the detriment of patients. This is a first step to re-integrate that purchasing pool. And as Sanders said, “If we win here in California, other states will be following very, very quickly.” An identical measure is scheduled for the Ohio ballot next year. In fact, states might not need to make the effort. The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office points out that federal law allows all state Medicaid programs to receive the same price for prescription drugs as the lowest payer in the U.S. If Prop 61 passes, that lowest price could well be the VA-tied drugs in California. So all Medicaid agencies could request the same deal, lowering prices for tens of millions of poor patients. (Including, ironically, Medi-Cal managed care, which was carved out of this proposition.) This would likely require defeating industry-initiated legal action. But the result would be chaotic—a chaos we actually need, I would argue. Under the current system, lawmakers are unwilling to do anything but scream about high drug prices. Prop 61 would give them a hammer, one that could be employed to create a fairer system for all Americans. Congress already has the power to do this; lawmakers did it for the VA, setting a price ceiling and limiting increases to the rate of inflation. The threat of transferring those benefits to virtually all Americans on government-run health care (and it says a lot that we have to call that a threat) could be the needed spur for a larger bargain, whether that includes faster FDA approval, federalization of research and development, changes to the patent laws, or value-based medicine that rewards providers for preventing the need for drugs in the first place. Without such a prod, drug companies will likely use their prodigious political influence to halt progress. That’s why Sanders likely sees Prop 61 as a worthwhile target for his political revolution. He has used the formidable base of support that he developed during the presidential campaign to target Big Pharma. Billboards across Los Angeles tout his Prop 61 endorsement; he cut a TV ad for the measure as well. The day of the rally, Sanders joked that a single tweet of his about Ariad Pharmaceuticals jacking up the price of a leukemia drug sent the company’s stock into free fall. Sanders recognizes that, when the status quo leaves Americans exposed, change can only come from the bottom up. In this case, one ballot measure could transform what we pay for drugs in America. “The entire nation is looking at California,” Sanders said. “Let’s go forward together.” Read More Politics, Bernie Sanders, Big Pharma, Prop 61, Health Care, Drugs Sign up for your daily dose of politics, culture, and big ideas.

Meet the Contributors → Eli Lilly Commits $15M More to Seattle Institute’s TB Drug Search Frank Vinluan October 18th, 2016 @frankvinluan @xconomy Like Us Xconomy Indiana —  Eli Lilly unveiled plans today to expand its work treating disease in the developing world, pledging $90 million to improve access to healthcare for 30 million people worldwide by 2030. Nestled in Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly’s (NYSE: LLY) plan is $15 million earmarked for the Infectious Disease Research Institute in Seattle. Though that sum is a small piece of Lilly’s overall $90 million commitment, it’s the company’s largest financial pledge to date in an eight-year partnership with the Seattle institute researching new tuberculosis drugs. Tuberculosis is a highly contagious bacterial infection affecting the lungs. Of the 10.4 million people infected by the disease in 2015, 1.8 million died, according to the World Health Organization. The WHO lists TB as one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide, with the overwhelming majority of those deaths occurring in the developing world. TB is typically treated with antibiotics. The challenge with this standard of care is the emergence of drug resistant TB strains, the IDRI told Xconomy in 2008. The institute has been researching drug candidates that show activity against drug-resistant strains of TB. So far, those efforts are still in preclinical studies. Immunologist Steve Reed founded the nonprofit IDRI in 1993. A mix of public, private, and nonprofit money funds the institute, which has a $22.5 million budget this year. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is a longtime backer of IDRI; besides Lilly, the institute also counts GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK) as a pharma industry supporter. Lilly began its collaboration with the IDRI following its 2007 acquisition of Bothell, WA-based drug developer Icos for about $2.3 billion. The pharma giant then donated to the institute $9 million worth of Icos drug-screening equipment it no longer needed along with another $6 million in cash. This partnership with IDRI, called the Lilly TB Drug Discovery Initiative, also hired some former Icos scientists. The initiative’s search for potential TB drug candidates started by screening compounds from Lilly as well as Merck (NYSE: MRK). In 2011, Lilly committed another $4.2 million to support the IDRI’s TB drug research. Eli Lilly is splitting the $90 million, five-year commitment to its “Global Health Partnership” evenly between company dollars and Eli Lilly and Company Foundation, its philanthropic arm. Lilly CEO John Leichleiter says the funding slated for the IDRI will be used to continue the institute’s TB drug discovery and development efforts. He adds that the $90 million Global Health Initiative builds on two Lilly corporate efforts already underway: a $170 million collaboration with drug manufacturers started in 2003 to increase the availability of antibiotics in countries that have high rates of TB; and a $30 million commitment in 2011 to address the rise of non-communicable diseases in developing countries. The latter partnership, which initially focused on diabetes, is now adding cancer as an area of therapeutic focus. Lilly says the partnership will work toward the company’s goal of improving the health of 30 million people by expanding its efforts and its partners in Brazil, China, India, Kenya, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and the United States. Community partners have not been finalized, but in Lilly’s hometown, the company plans to work with local public health officials.

 Roche's lung cancer drug wins U.S. approval Reuters Oct. 18, 2016, 5:40 PM 179 facebook linkedin twitter email print The logo of Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche is seen outside their headquarters in Basel Thomson Reuters By John Miller (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG's new immunotherapy, Tecentriq, won approval on Tuesday from U.S. health regulators as a second-line lung cancer treatment, a decision seen likely to erode Bristol-Myers Squibb's position in this hotly contested market. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Tecentriq to be used in non-small cell lung cancer patients previously treated with chemotherapy, regardless of whether their tumors express a protein called PD-L1. People with high PD-L1 levels are generally more receptive to immunotherapy. In study results released this month, patients getting Tecentriq lived on average 4.2 months longer than those taking chemotherapy. Tecentriq is aiming for a share of the treatment market now dominated by Bristol's Opdivo, a drug which doctors can also prescribe for patients regardless of their levels of immune-system suppressing PD-L1 expression. In the first half, Opdivo sales hit $1.58 billion, about three times that of Merck & Co's drug, Keytruda, that is prescribed only for people who express a certain level of PD-L1. Analysts estimate Tecentriq's annual sales across all cancers - it is already approved for bladder cancer and will seek approval for more indications - will reach $4 billion in 2021, according to consensus figures compiled by Thomson Reuters. Tecentriq, Opdivo and Keytruda are the initial entrants in a highly promising class of immunotherapy drugs now transforming cancer treatment and are jockeying for pole position, either for use alone or in combination with other drugs. Lung cancer, responsible for 20 percent of the annual 8 million annual cancer deaths worldwide, is the top commercial opportunity.

Commenting further Nigel Gaunt said that while confident the future for incentive, conference & event (ICE) industry is bright, it will be very challenging and demanding for practitioners with client expectations requiring high standard events to be delivered in ever-decreasing time frames. The Challenge of Change is one of the key topics to be addressed in Singapore next month at the ICESAP Conference to be held November 30 to December 2. Nigel Gaunt is adamant that ICE practitioners and organisations must stay ahead of the curve by embracing change and the very latest industry developments as well as advances in technology and communication processes.  All in an era in which budgets and timelines are being squeezed and expectations are escalating. "When bringing an organisation's people together, technology advances and the latest service offerings, actually open up the potential for events to be increasingly powerful platforms for businesses to achieve their strategic objectives and growth aspirations", said Nigel Gaunt. "The key is audience engagement through creativity and open-mindedness in the way events are structured to maximise P2P and B2P interaction.  That's what incentives, conferences and events are all about!" ICESAP has brought together an outstanding panel of industry leaders to provide thought provoking high powered presentations and Q & A session on The Challenge of Change. The moderator is Robin Lokerman, Board-member, ICESAP, and Group President, MCI-Group and the panel will consist of – Charles Robinson, SVP & MD, Jack Morton Worldwide (Singapore) Ramesh Daryanani, VP, Global Sales, Asia Pacific, Marriot International Meredith Smith, Exec Director, Enterprise Shared Services, Merck Sharp & Dohme The expert industry panel will address – -  How can innovation help the evolution of procurement departments, especially in the face of ever tougher targets? -  What will the impact of technology and the 'sharing economy' have on the industry landscape? -  How to keep up with the increasing pace of change despite the varying speeds of the Asian economies? Nigel Gaunt concluded, "ICESAP members are dedicated to finding effective incentive, conference and event solutions for clients.  Attendees at the upcoming 2016 ICESAP Conference in Singapore will benefit with insights and strategies on how best to succeed and prosper in the modern Asia Pacific ICE era".

Trial subanalysis suggests effect, but consistency questioned MedpageToday savesaved register today Earn Free CME Credits by reading the latest medical news in your specialty.sign up by Nicole Lou Reporter, MedPage Today/CRTonline.org October 18, 2016 Action Points Vorapaxar (Zontivity) was associated with reduced need to revascularize patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). Note that the current FDA approval is for reduction in cardiovascular events among patients with history of MI or PAD, and no history of stroke or transient ischemic attacks. Vorapaxar (Zontivity) was associated with reduced need to revascularize patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD), a randomized trial substudy found. In the TRA 2ºP–TIMI 50 trial, patients on the protease-activated receptor-1 antagonist vorapaxar had fewer peripheral revascularizations at 3 years (15.4% versus 19.3% for placebo, HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72-0.93), particularly surgical procedures (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.48-0.74) Marc P. Bonaca, MD, of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, and colleagues noted that the difference was "directionally consistent across type of procedure and indication" in their study appearing online in JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions: Acute limb ischemia (2.6% versus 3.5%, HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.96) Asymptomatic severe stenosis (1.0% versus 1.6%, HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.41-1.06) Critical limb ischemia (4.8% versus 5.7%, HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.67-1.07) Claudication (11.5% versus 13.5%, HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.76-1.03) "We have reported previously that vorapaxar reduced peripheral revascularization in patients randomized with symptomatic PAD," the group wrote in a nod to the original study that led to the drug's FDA approval in 2014. "The present study adds to this observation by demonstrating that the pattern of efficacy was consistent across the spectrum of indications and types of procedures, ranging from acute thrombotic events such as acute limb ischemia to progressive atherosclerotic vascular disease including worsening claudication and critical limb ischemia." "These data support PAR-1 as a therapeutic target for the reduction of limb morbidity in patients with PAD," Bonaca's group concluded. Not so fast, suggested Robert D. Safian, MD, of Beaumont Health in Royal Oak, Mich., noting that the reduction in major adverse limb events was not significant for endovascular intervention or amputation or for patients with acute limb ischemia, critical (chronic) limb ischemia, or asymptomatic severe stenosis and only a nonsignificant trend in patients with progressive claudication. "The main limitation of this study is that the authors have obscured these findings by emphasizing the directional consistency of their results, in the absence of significant differences," he wrote in an accompanying editorial. Furthermore, TRA 2ºP–TIMI 50 originally showed that "vorapaxar caused a significant increase in the risk of moderate or severe bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage, resulting in early termination in patients with a history of stroke," according to Safian, who noted that the current FDA approval is for reduction in cardiovascular events among patients with history of MI or PAD, and no history of stroke or transient ischemic attacks. Bonaca's trial randomized 26,449 patients to vorapaxar or placebo on a background of standard therapy. Participants had histories of MI, stroke, or symptomatic PAD -- with a known history of PAD recorded in 5,845 individuals at randomization. Patients with known PAD had a 16% rate of revascularization over a median of 2.5 years. The procedures were done for worsening claudication (55%), critical limb ischemia (24%), acute limb ischemia (16%), and asymptomatic severe stenosis (4%). The investigators acknowledged that peripheral revascularization was site reported and not adjudicated. It is also unknown whether patients received other therapies -- such as supervised exercise programs -- which raises the potential for confounding in the study. Nevertheless, the totality of the vorapaxar data published to date seem to agree on several fronts, according to the editorialist. "First, as is true of some studies of aspirin and clopidogrel [Plavix], vorapaxar does not seem to be useful for secondary prevention of major adverse cardiovascular events in PAD patients, although there is benefit in patients with prior MI." "Second, given issues about cost and bleeding complications, it seems unlikely that there will be much enthusiasm for vorapaxar for triple antiplatelet therapy after routine MI or stenting. However, studies of vorapaxar alone or in combination with a single antiplatelet agent might prove beneficial, possibly without the risk of major bleeding," Safian wrote. "Alternatively, there may be subgroups of high-risk patients who might benefit from triple therapy." He suggested that vorapaxar may have potential value in patients with coronary artery bypass grafts, who are also at high risk for early thrombosis and accelerated atherosclerosis. "Finally, further studies are needed to determine the value of vorapaxar in patients with aspirin hypersensitivity or low on-treatment platelet reactivity with other antiplatelet agents." The TRA 2ºP–TIMI 50 Trial was supported by Merck. Bonaca declared consulting for Merck, AstraZeneca, and Bayer. The TIMI Study Group disclosed support from Accumetrics, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Beckman Coulter, Bristol-Myers Squibb, CV Therapeutics, Daiichi-Sankyo, Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline, Integrated Therapeutics, Merck, Nanosphere, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Nuvelo, Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Pfizer, Roche Diagnostics, Sanofi, Sanofi-Synthelabo, Siemens Medical Solutions, and Singulex. Safian reported no relevant conflicts of interest.

Set aside even cancer, diabetes, and traffic accidents. The No. 1 threat to civilization might very well be good old bacteria. At the conclusion of his December 11, 1945, Nobel Lecture, Sir Alexander Fleming hypothesized about an “ignorant man” giving himself “not enough to kill the streptococci but enough to educate them to resist penicillin.” The man who shared the 1945 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Ernst Boris Chain and Sir Howard Walter Florey “for the discovery of penicillin and its curative effect in various infectious diseases” warned of what we now refer to as “antimicrobial resistance” (AMR). Random changes in organisms’ DNA can have no effect, they can be helpful, and they can be harmful. How you describe such effects is all a matter of perspective. Take bacteria. Here, courtesy of BoingBoing and Harvard Medical School, you can “watch bacteria become resistant to antibiotics in a matter of days.” That’s good for the bacteria. But at the very best, that’s neutral for us humans. And it may indeed signal something really, really bad. The Harvard Medical School video is titled “The Evolution of Bacteria on a ‘Mega-Plate’ Petri Dish.” This mega-plate petri dish measures two feet by four feet. Random changes in organisms’ DNA can have no effect, they can be helpful, and they can be harmful. How you describe such effects is all a matter of perspective. Researchers divided the petri dish into nine bands and lined the base of it with normal levels of agar. The background is black, while the bacteria — Escherichia coli, or E. coli — are white. In the two outside bands, the researchers put no antibiotic. In the next two bands, “there’s barely more than E. coli can survive,” with a value of one for purposes of the experiment. The next two bands contained 10 times as much, the next two after that 100 times as much. The center band contained 1,000 times as much antibiotic as E. coli can survive. After 11 days, the bacteria penetrated and dominated the center band. The experiment illustrates “the process of accumulating successive mutations” that allows the bacteria “normally sensitive to an antibiotic” to “evolve resistance to extremely high concentrations in a short period of time.” We’ve been using antibiotics and similar drugs — collectively known as “antimicrobial agents” — for more than seven decades. Such drugs are used to treat patients who have infectious diseases. But their use has proliferated to an extent that we’re now confronting a novel challenge: AMR. According to an October 2015 study published by the journal PLoS Biology, “Antibiotics are commonly used in animal husbandry, beekeeping, fish-farming and other forms of aquaculture, ethanol production, horticulture, anti-fouling paints, food preservation, and domestically. This provides multiple opportunities for the selection and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.” These are what are commonly referred to now as “superbugs.” Dame Sally Davies, currently Chief Medical Officer for England and formerly a professor with the London School of Medicine, framed the problem during a September 23, 2016, conversation with William Karesh of the Council on Foreign Relations: We misuse antibiotics everywhere. So over 50% of antibiotics worldwide are used in animals and agriculture, including fish farming, actually. In the States, about 80% of your antibiotics are used in animal production. They’re used for growth promotion and in well animals. So they’re actually substituting for good hygiene and sanitation. And as a result, infections — drug-resistant infections — are more prevalent in the States. My working assumption is that your waste disposal is effective, your sewage is effective. But if you go to big farms in China, where they also use antibiotics for growth promotion, the runoff from those farms is full of antibiotics because when animals, including the human animal, eat antibiotics and/or take them, we excrete 70% to 80% of the antibiotics as they are. The rest is residue. So it goes straight into the environment, unless you’ve got good waste management. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “at least 2 million people per year in the United States become infected with bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics, and at least 23,000 people die as a direct result of these infections.” These are what are commonly referred to now as “superbugs.” Worldwide, the number is more than 700,000. By 2050, we could be looking at 10 million AMR-related deaths per year. For reference’s sake, cancer kills about 8.2 million worldwide annually. We’re doing fantastic things in medical science and biotechnology these days — immunotherapy holds significant cancer-cure promise, gene editing could help us solve Alzheimer’s, robotic surgery will make operations less invasive and more precise, we’re helping quadriplegics “feel” things via neural implants. But we’ve fallen behind on some of the basics. One problem is that the market for antibiotics just isn’t very lucrative. There’s much more money in cancer drugs, for example, or diabetes and hypertension drugs, which have small margins but generate profits over the long haul because patients use them for life. And that’s where pharmaceutical companies’ research and development dollars are going. We can treat cancer, but a cancer patient might, along the way, develop an infection for which there is no antibiotic. So they survive the cancer but die from the infection. Vaccination — which is just a way to stimulate the body’s natural immune response in order to fight infection — is another alternative to widespread human use of antibiotics. Right now, the problem is a lack of access to antibiotics, rather than resistance of bacteria to antibiotics. But that could change. And it will change we continue to prescribe antibiotics without a diagnosis supporting that prescription. Persistent overuse in agriculture is also a significant problem. Government entities can wave the flag for “new antibiotics and better diagnostics and better ways of surveillance,” as Dame Sally Davies put it. At the same time, “It’s not in our hands to impact the veterinary use or the fish-farm use. It’s not in our hands to do more than to comment and advise on the environmental contamination.” We can treat cancer, but a cancer patient might, along the way, develop an infection for which there is no antibiotic. So they survive the cancer but die from the infection. Innovation is now getting a jump-start in the AMR race. France-based Eligo Bioscience recently secured 2 million euros from Seventure Partners to fund research into a potential CRISPR-based solution to the AMR problem. And Iterum Therapeutics will use $40 million in Series A funding to launch an antibiotic licensed from another, unnamed company. Iterum was founded by former executives of Durata, the subject of a November 2014 $675 million buyout by Actavis, which itself was subsequently acquired by Allergan. Durata’s antibiotic Dalvance is used to treat adults with skin infections. Heavyweights are also making their presence felt, as Allergan Plc (AGN), AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Merck & Co. Inc. (MRK), Novartis AG (NVS), Pfizer Inc. (PFE), and Sanofi SA (SNY) are among the “signatory companies” to a “roadmap to combat antimicrobial resistance” announced September 20, 2016. Mutations — the “raw materials of evolution” — are what made us. But mutations may, ultimately, be the death of us, too. NBNBC A group of undergraduate students at Stanford University’s Chemistry, Engineering & Medicine for Human Health institute (ChEM-H) are working on “novel antibiotics from scratch that might one day stand up to superbugs.” The students are focusing on two bacteria with high mortality rates that are resistant to nearly all antibiotics, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Their plan has already attracted a $10,000 grant from the ChEM-H institute. Filsinger Interrante, one of the students, told Stanford News, “We believe that these diseases are so bad that if we develop something that actually works, doctors will use it and hospitals will want to have it.” Smart Investing, David Dittman Editorial Director, Wall Street Daily Editorial Director David Dittman is an investment newsletter professional with more than 10 years' experience at staff, management, and strategic levels.
