Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Story highlights The fines stem from both a criminal and a civil case The company promoted Vioxx for rheumatoid arthritis before it had approval Vioxx was not approved for that use until April 2002 Washington (CNN)Pharmaceutical giant Merck will plead guilty to charges related to illegal promotional activity for the painkiller Vioxx and pay fines and settlement costs totaling nearly a billion dollars, the Justice Department announced Tuesday. Justice officials said Merck, Sharp and Dohme Corp. has agreed to the massive settlement to resolve criminal charges and civil claims stemming from its promotion and marketing of Vioxx. The drug was withdrawn from the marketplace in September 2004. Under the agreement, Merck will plead to a misdemeanor charge for the illegal promotion and pay a $321 million criminal fine. The firm also agreed to a civil settlement under which it will pay $628 million to resolve allegations of off-label marketing and false statements about the cardiovascular safety of Vioxx. The federal government will receive $426 million from the civil settlement and the remaining $202 million will be distributed to the participating Medicaid states, the Justice Department said. Read More "When a pharmaceutical company ignores FDA rules aimed at keeping our medicines safe and effective, that company undermines the ability of health care providers to make the best medical decisions on behalf of their patients," Assistant Attorney General Tony West said. The FDA approved Vioxx for three medical purposes in 1999 but did not approve its use against rheumatoid arthritis until April 2002. The government says that for nearly three years in the interim, Merck promoted Vioxx for rheumatoid arthritis. An FDA warning letter was sent to Merck in 2001 for making the claims. Officials say that while this is not a record settlement, the $950 million agreement places it among the top five on record. Content by LendingTree Rates hit 2.75% APR (15 yr).

Infectious diseases and women health and empowering women in research will be the focus of the 2nd UNESCO-Merck Africa Research Summit – MARS 2016 to be held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia from November 28-29, 2016. The UNESCO – MARS 2016 will be inaugurated by Getchaw Engida, deputy director-general, UNESCO; Yifru Berhane, minister for Health, Ethiopia, and Frank Stangenberg-Haverkamp, chairman of the executive board and family board of E. Merck KG. UNESCO – MARS 2016 will bring together more than 200 researchers from more than 35 African countries to discuss the generation, sharing and dissemination of research data and to prepare for the road ahead in developing Africa as an international hub for research excellence and scientific innovation. UNESCO – MARS 2016 has attracted 15 African ministers of Health; Education; Science and Technology and Gender & Social Development to participate in two ministerial high level panels on: “defining interventions to advance research capacity and empower women in research to improve women health in Africa” and “research and policy making gap in Africa – challenges and opportunities – Africa as a new international hub for research excellence and scientific information,” emphasized Rasha Kelej, chief social officer, Merck Healthcare. “The theme of the Summit Infectious diseases and women health is informed by the fact that for many infectious diseases, women are at higher risk and have a more severe course of illness than men for many reasons including biological differences, social inequities, and restrictive cultural norms. Therefore, efforts to recognize and reduce health disparities among women have particular relevance for global health,” Kelej emphasised. “The Summit will focus on the relation between infectious diseases and cancer in women, untreated infectious diseases and the high prevalence of infertility in Africa,” Kelej added. It will also aim to identify the scientific research priorities for evolving health needs to address infectious diseases such as; Malaria, Schistosomiasis and Zika in relation to women heath. On the second day of UNESCO – MARS 2016, Merck on-line research community blog will be launched to enable young researchers to exchange experience and knowledge with their peers and with established researchers in Africa and beyond. Of the 200 researchers attending the Summit 60 percent are women. This is contributing to one of the main objectives of the UNESCO-MARS which is; empowering women who in research. “In addition, the UNESCO – MARS 2016  will launch for the first time the ‘Best African Woman Research Awards’ to recognize the outstanding contribution of African women researchers and scientists with the aim of promoting women in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics),” Rasha Kelej said. During the Summit, Young African Researchers who have submitted outstanding abstracts will be recognised. The first three young African Researchers will be eligible for a number of research awards, while a further research awards will be dedicated for the ‘Best African Women Researchers’. This year’s Summit has attracted 15 African Ministers of Health; Education; Science and Technology; Gender and Social Development to participate in two ministerial high level panels.

The second UNESCO – MARS Summit is a unique opportunity for Africa’s young and talented scientists to share their research output and findings with the top echelon of scientists from Africa and abroad. It is also an opportunity for networking and career development. The Summit will present a platform where young scientists will be able to discuss the enabling environment for better research among others. During the 2015 Summit, several participants were recognized and awarded for excellence in research, in which, two scientists were awarded six-month fellowships in Merck’s Biotechnology R&D hub in Germany. The first award of a six month fellowship at the Merck R&D hub was granted to Benard Kulohoma, Kenya and Rebecca Chukwuanukwu, Nigeria. Both of them have actively contributed towards the preparation of the 2nd UNESCO – MARS 2016. The first UNESCO-Merck Africa Research Summit 2015 was successfully organized and held in Geneva, Switzerland in October 2015 with the focus on emergent infectious diseases such as Ebola.

Here is what two of our regulator healthcare contributors had to say. George Budwell (TMFGBudwell) Nov 11, 2016 at 8:02AM Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) undoubtedly deserves its place among the pantheon of top big pharma stocks with its nearly $40 billion in annual sales. However, the drugmaker has yet to put the so-called patent cliff in the rearview mirror, with top-selling medicines Remicade, Cubicin, and Zetia all set to lose patent protection over the next year or so. With this looming headwind in mind, we asked two of our regular healthcare contributors why investors should buy -- or avoid -- this blue chip stock right now. Here's what they had to say. Image source: Getty Images Buy this big pharma stock for the dividend, stay for the long-term growth George Budwell: Although Merck's top line is forecast to come in flat next year, there are several solid reasons to stay patient with this big pharma stock. Merck's Keytruda, after all, recently won a critical battle with Bristol-Myers Squibb's (NYSE:BMY) star immuno-oncology drug, Opdivo. Digging into the details reveals that the FDA approved Keytruda on Oct. 24 as a first-line treatment for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients with high PD-L1 expression. And, as an added bonus, the agency also expanded the drug's label in the second-line metastatic NSCLC setting to include patients whose tumors express PD-L1 at 1% with disease progression during or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. As a reminder, the pivotal trial assessing competitor Opdivo's effectiveness in the front-line setting for NSCLC missed the mark, paving the way for Keytruda to dominate this high-value indication going forward. Perhaps equally important, though, Keytruda is now expected to steal a significant chunk of the second-line setting away from Bristol's drug, as oncologists become more familiar with Keytruda due to its approval in the front-line arena, combined with its less restrictive labeling for this indication. Taken together, these two positive regulatory developments are expected to add around $2.5 billion to Keytruda's peak sales.  Looking ahead, Merck is attempting to push Keytruda into rarefied air in terms of commercial potential with over 200 studies currently underway across more than 30 different tumor types. Keytruda's peak sales could reach an astronomical $15 billion within the next decade, making it one of the best-selling drugs of all time.  Beyond Keytruda, Merck sports a vast pipeline of immuno-oncology drugs that should widen its footprint in this ultrahigh-growth market. Now, of course, there will be clinical and regulatory setbacks along the way. But I'm willing to go out on a limb and say that Merck will be able to overcome these forthcoming patent headwinds to return to growth no later than 2018. Until then, investors can enjoy the drugmaker's healthy dividend yield of 3.13%.  Impending losses to offset Cory Renauer: Merck & Co. may have a multibillion-dollar blockbuster on its hands, but I'm not sure Keytruda alone can offset losses to incoming competition for some of the company's best-selling products. Brand Name Q3 2016 Sales Percentage of Total Q3 2016 Sales Main Patent Expirations Remicade $311 Million 3% Feb. 2015 (EU) Cubicin $320 Million 3% 2016 Zostavax $190 Million 1.8% 2016 Zetia $671 Million 6.4% 2017 Januvia/Janumet $1.55 Billion 14.7% 2022 Data source: Merck & Co. financial statements. Table by author. Patents in U.S. Region, except Remicade. Last February the company lost exclusivity for Remicade in the EU, where it has a license to sell Johnson & Johnson's popular anti-inflammatory injection. Merck's annual Remicade revenue peaked at $2.37 billion in 2014, but biosimilar competition is steadily eating into sales of the key product. Additional versions of Remicade have started a slow but steady race to the bottom. In 2015 Merck shelled out $9.5 billion to acquire Cubist Pharmaceuticals for rights to Cubicin and other antibiotics. Unfortunately, its attempt to block generic competition in the courts didn't work out. In the U.S., sales of the antibiotic have already started falling, along with sales for its shingles vaccine, Zostavax. Sales of Merck's big cholesterol buster, Zetia, are still on the rise, but will probably reverse course soon. The patent expires next April, and a previous legal settlement should allow India's Glenmark Pharmaceuticals to begin selling a generic version this December. Diabetes drug Januvia isn't facing a loss of exclusivity, but growth of Merck's best-selling product has ground to a halt worldwide and started sliding in the U.S., based on year-to-date sales. I expect Januvia losses to accelerate as the aging DPP-4 drug loses ground to increasingly popular GLP-1 agonists, such as Eli Lilly's Trulicity, and SLGT2 inhibitors like Invokana from Johnson & Johnson. With products responsible for roughly 29% of total sales under threat, achieving growth in the years ahead won't be easy for Merck. At about 17 times forward earnings, Merck shares aren't terribly expensive, but I think you can find better bargains in the healthcare sector. Cory Renauer owns shares of Johnson and Johnson.

Merck Wins R&D 100 Award for Top Invention Merck Wins R&D 100 Award for Top Invention CHIMICA E FARMACIA Tweet Condividi su WhatsApp Pubblicato il: 11/11/2016 14:01 - Sanger Arrayed Lentiviral CRISPR Libraries wins in Analytical/Test category DARMSTADT, Germany, Nov. 11, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Merck, a leading science and technology company, received a prestigious R&D 100 Award for its Sanger Arrayed Lentiviral CRISPR Libraries—the first of its kind CRISPR libraries. R&D Magazine announced the awards at its 54th Annual R&D 100 Awards Dinner on Nov. 3 in Washington D.C. Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161110/437980 "Advancements in gene editing with tools like CRISPR are helping our customers discover and manufacture new treatments for the most difficult conditions," said Udit Batra, member of the Merck Executive Board and CEO, Life Science. "We will continue to collaborate with the global scientific community to deliver the promise of their innovations faster and work to accelerate access to health for people everywhere." Recognition of these world-class products showcases Merck's commitment to empowering scientists and researchers with the solutions they need to develop new tools that can improve human health. The awards, known as the "Oscars of Invention," honor the year's 100 most innovative scientific and technological breakthroughs. Merck's Sanger Arrayed Lentiviral CRISPR Libraries won in the Analytical/Test category. These libraries are the first human and mouse arrayed lentiviral CRISPR libraries for knocking out and screening gene function. The library allows discovery of genes involved in drug resistance, human disease and a wide variety of biological processes. Researchers can use the entire library to screen the entire genome or they can select specific genes and pathways to screen using the associated clones. This is Merck's fifth year in a row receiving an R&D 100 Award. In 2015, the AFS water purification systems and Simplicon RNA Reprogramming Technology were named in the process/prototyping and analytical/test categories, respectively. The R&D 100 Awards span industry, academia and government-sponsored research. All Merck news releases are distributed by email at the same time they become available on the Merck Website.

FACEBOOKEMAILDRUCKEN Kommentare Kommentar schreiben Top Themen Heute Tesla - ein Übernahmekandidat? Diese Unternehmen könnten Interesse habenAnleger aufgepasst! Was Fonds-Anteilen nach Silvester drohtWarum die Apple-Aktie besonders unter Präsident Trump leidet Der überraschende Sieg von Donald Trump bei der Wahl zum US-Präsidenten hatte zur Wochenmitte wie zu vermuten zunächst zu einer extremen “Risk-off”-Bewegung an den globalen Finanzmärkten geführt. Doch stellte sich die anfängliche Panikreaktion als erstaunlich kurzlebig heraus. Der deutsche Aktienmarkt konnte sich nach einer deutlichen Abwärtslücke zur Eröffnung dynamisch erholen und beendete den Handelstag dann sogar mit deutlichen Zugewinnen. Der DAX schloss 1,56 Prozent höher bei 10.646 Punkten. Das Tief hatte der Leitindex bei 10.175 Punkten markiert. MDAX und TecDAX verbesserten sich um 0,23 beziehungsweise 1,18 Prozent. Unter den 110 größten Aktien gab es 75 Gewinner und 35 Verlierer. Das Aufwärtsvolumen lag bei 67 Prozent. Das Gesamtvolumen war extrem hoch. Im DAX wurden 173,8 Millionen Aktien im Wert von 6,47 Milliarden EUR (5-Tages-Durchschnitt: 2,92) umgesetzt. Am deutlichsten stiegen die Aktien aus den Bereichen Pharma + Healthcare sowie Bauwerte. Versorger und Immobilienwerte wurden hingegen gemieden. Als stärkster DAX-Wert haussierte Fresenius SE um 7,10 Prozent. Bayer verteuerte sich um 5,16 Prozent. Merck schloss 4,86 Prozent fester. Volkswagen büßte am Indexende 2,06 Prozent ein. Beiersdorf und Vonovia verloren 1,36 beziehungsweise 1,30 Prozent. An der Wall Street legte der Dow Jones Industrial um 1,40 Prozent auf 18.590 Punkte zu. Der von Technologiewerten geprägte Nasdaq 100 verbesserte sich um 0,42 Prozent auf 4.825 Punkte. 54 Prozent der Werte an der NYSE verzeichneten Zugewinne. 202 neue 52-Wochen-Hochs standen 119 neuen Tiefs gegenüber. Mit Blick auf die Sektorenperformance lagen Finanzwerte und Werte aus dem Gesundheitsbereich ganz vorne. Die größten Verlierer waren Versorger und Immobilienwerte. Um 7,69 Prozent sprang die Aktie von Caterpillar und setzte sich damit die Dow-Spitze. Dahinter folgten Pfizer (+7,06%) und Merck (+6,06%). Am anderen Indexende verloren die multinational agierenden Konzerne Procter & Gamble und Coca-Cola 1,74 respektive 1,42 Prozent. Auch am Währungsmarkt folgte einer anfänglichen Flucht in die sicheren Häfen eine beeindruckende Umkehrbewegung hin zu mehr Risikofreude. Der Dollar-Index notierte gegen Ende des New Yorker Handels mit 0,53 Prozent im Plus bei 98,48 Punkten. Im asiatischen Handel war er auf ein 5-Wochen-Tief bei 95,88 Punkten eingebrochen. Der Euro wertete gegenüber allen anderen Hauptwährungen mit Ausnahme des Austral-Dollars ab. EUR/USD fiel um 0,77 Prozent auf ein 2-Wochen-Tief bei 1,0941 USD. In der Spitze hatte das Währungspaar ein 2-Monats-Hoch bei 1,1300 USD markiert. Mit Blick auf die anderen Majors fielen das Pfund Sterling mit Stärke und der Austral-Dollar mit Schwäche auf. Trotz des am Ende des Tages festeren US-Dollars verteuerten sich die meisten Rohstoffe. Der S&P GSCI für 24 Spotpreise schloss 0,55 Prozent höher bei 356,58 Punkten. Ein etwas stärker als erwarteter Aufbau der Rohöllagerbestände in den USA belastete am Nachmittag nur kurzzeitig. Brent-Öl notierte gegen Ende des New Yorker Handels 0,93 Prozent höher bei 46,47 USD. Die US-Sorte WTI stieg um 0,67 Prozent auf 45,28 USD. Beide Sorten hatten am Morgen mit der allgemeinen “Risk-off”-Bewegung an den Märkten noch deutliche Abschläge gezeigt und neue Korrektur-Tiefs markiert. Der Preis für US-Erdgas stieg um 2,92 Prozent auf 2,71 USD. Kupfer haussierte an der Comex um 3,53 Prozent auf ein 14-Monats-Hoch bei 2,46 USD und bestätigte damit das Ausbruchssignal des Vortages. Gold war am Morgen als sicherer Hafen noch um rund 5 Prozent über 1.330 USD nach oben gesprungen, notierte jedoch am Abend knapp im Minus bei 1.273 USD (1.171 EUR). Platin verlor 0,75 Prozent. Silber und Palladium konnten um 0,10 beziehungsweise 1,98 Prozent zulegen. Auch am Rentenmarkt kam es zu extremen Kursausschlägen in beide Richtungen. Die Umlaufrendite stieg um zwei Basispunkte auf 0,00 Prozent. Die Rendite zehnjähriger Bundesanleihen war am Morgen auf ein Tief bei 0,09 Prozent gefallen. Die anschließende Rückkehr der Risikofreude beförderte sie am Ende um zwei Basispunkte nach oben auf 0,21 Prozent. Dies war der höchste Tagesschluss in 6 Monaten. Der Euro-Bund-Future schloss 0,53 Prozent niedriger bei 160,94 Punkten, einem neuen Kontrakt-Tief. Am Morgen war er noch mit der Flucht in die sicheren Häfen auf ein 2-Wochen-Hoch bei 163,19 Punkten geklettert. Die Rendite zehnjähriger US-Treasury Notes stieg um 19 Basispunkte beziehungsweise 10 Prozent auf ein 10-Monats-Hoch bei 2,07 Prozent. Die asiatischen Aktienmärkte tendierten heute früh auf breiter Front kräftig nordwärts. Der MSCI Asia Pacific Index sprang um 3,17 Prozent auf 137,67 Punkte. Für den Nikkei 225 ging es als regionalen Spitzenreiter um rund 6,6 Prozent nach oben. Schwache japanische Core-Machinery-Orders im September (-3,3%) wirkten sich nicht auf das Kursgeschehen aus. Heute richtet sich der Blick auf eine Flut an Quartalszahlen. Es berichten unter anderem Deutsche Telekom, Siemens, Continental, Unicredit, Enel, Engie, Astrazeneca, Generali, K+S, TAG Immobilien, Aareal Bank, Lanxess, Hannover Rück, Bilfinger, Evotec, SMA Solar, Stada, Salzgitter, Nordex, Puma, Zalando, Hamborner Reit, Ströer, GFT Technologies, Jenoptik, RTL Group, Cancom, Dürr, SGL Carbon, Hamburger Hafen und Logistik, SLM Solutions Group, Wacker Neuson, König & Bauer und Ferratum Oyi.

How to Invest in Health Care in a Trump Presidency U.S. News & World Report - Money 4 days ago Matt Whittaker © (NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images) US President-elect Donald Trump (C) and his wife Melania walk at the US Capitol in Washington, DC, on November 10, 2016. Stocks of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies got a boost Wednesday as investors expressed relief for President-elect Donald Trump, who is expected to less aggressively pursue price controls for drug makers than Democrat Hillary Clinton. Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 106.63 +0.92 +0.87% Bank of America Corporation BAC ▼ 19.88 -0.21 -1.02% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▲ 58.91 +0.79 +1.35% General Electric Co GE ▼ 30.33 -0.18 -0.59% However, publicly traded hospital companies took hits over investor concerns about the potential fate of the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare, which brought them a new wave of customers. Until Trump's health care policies become clear, investors should take a wait-and-see approach before taking actions in the broad sector, investing experts say. [See: 10 Ways to Invest in Pharmaceuticals With ETFs.] Despite an overnight selloff in global markets as it became clear that Trump would win, sparking uncertainty, U.S. equities markets on moved higher after the election. The impact on health care stocks is not just coming from the results of the presidential election, says Ernie Cecilia, chief investment officer with Bryn Mawr Trust. Cecilia notes that Republicans maintained control of Congress, and a proposition in California that would have capped prices paid by most state-funded health insurance programs was defeated. He says if that measure had passed in California, similar measures would have found their way into other states. Big pharmaceutical names are substantially higher on the strength of Trump's victory. Pfizer (ticker: PFE) is up 10.2 percent this week, while Merck & Co. (MRK) rallied 8.2 percent. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology exchange-traded fund (IBB) rose nearly 11 percent. Both Clinton and Trump talked about measures aimed at controlling high prices for drugs during a year that saw debate over Mylan's (MYL) price increases on EpiPen injectors for allergic reactions and Turing Pharmaceuticals announced a price hike on an HIV/AIDS drug. John Conlon chief equity strategist at People's United Bank, says a Clinton presidency would have had a more severe impact on drug makers' pricing power and revenue. Health care stocks had been under pressure from worry about what would be the mechanism for price control, Conlon says. Meanwhile, hospitals did not fare so well. HCA Holdings (HCA) fell nearly 10 percent this week; Tenet Healthcare Corp. (THC) was down nearly 27 percent and Community Health Systems (CYH) shed 18 percent. The selloff in hospitals comes amid fears that Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress will repeal at least parts of the Affordable Care Act and leave hospitals with fewer customers, says Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist with Brown Brothers Harriman. Trump said repeatedly during the campaign he would seek to repeal Obamacare. Investors were repositioning portfolios on Wednesday, Clemons says. But retail investors should wait and see, he says. "In this kind of environment of heightened uncertainty, investors should take a long-term view," Clemons says. Clemons also notes that this surprise election result is similar to Britain's recent decision to leave the European Union, which was also a stunner, in that there will be a period of unknowns. "What we're embarking on now is a process," he says. While political policies do matter for a company's stock price, they matter less when it comes to underlying fundamentals, he says. For example, the need for what large market capitalized pharmaceutical companies produce is not going away as the developed world ages, becomes more wealthy and tends to spend more on quality of life, Clemons says. "There's a natural increase in the underlying fundamental demand for health care," he says. Also, if a company is based in multiple locations, it may be able to weather political changes in one area, he says. Clemons compares short-term market rebalancing to breaking waves, but the longer-term fundamentals are like the tide. Big pharma companies as well as smaller health care firms that can reduce prices based on efficiencies, rather than blunt political pricing pressure, will be more attractive under a Trump presidency, Clemons says. Cecilia recommends letting the dust settle before investing in biotech and pharma, but he is positive on the sector over the longer term. Shorter term catalysts for entry could include statements by Trump or his administration on pharmaceutical pricing, perhaps his Cabinet selections and who ends up holding important chairmanships in the Senate, Cecilia says. And Conlon is generally bullish on this portion of the health care sector. "It's a very attractive area," he says.

The World Health Organization states that consumption of tobacco leads to six million deaths every year while 600, 000 are exposed to second-hand smoke, which is known to cause asthma. Thus the changes in lifestyle are anticipated to play a crucial role in the development of global market.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    CNBC's Jim Cramer said President-elect Donald Trump's proposed policies are "extraordinary" rocket fuel to the surging stock market. Financial, construction and energy stocks have rallied in response to the Republican's victory. As a result, Cramer is now bullish on drug and health stocks. "This expansion in the banks not just because of regulation, but it's also because of interest rates going higher, but it's also because people feel loan growth is going to be better, people feel lower taxes [are coming]," Cramer said on CNBC. "When that group [of financial stocks] leads, that's a freight train," he said. "What I'm seeing ... is a pile-on on what [were] considered to be, I think, the worst stocks in the world if Hillary Clinton were elected president," Cramer said. Meanwhile, "the biggest impact of this shocking election is probably on the healthcare group,” he said on CNBC. The prospect of Clinton winning the White House had weighed on drug stocks, especially after she tweeted about cracking down on pharmaceutical price gouging in September 2015. But Cramer explains that Republicans seek limited regulation and free markets. Cramer doesn't expect them to crack down on drug pricing because it would stifle innovation. Cramer also expects Republicans to attempt to repeal Obamacare, which could hurt many healthcare plays, but he thinks the Democrats in the Senate will filibuster. Cramer warned that not all companies are worth owning, as some are engaged in a price war with competitors, such as the wholesale drug distributors. "For the segments of the health care sector that don't have price wars, I think we need to get a lot more positive because these stocks have more room to run," Cramer said. Cramer said savvy investors already know to avoid Valeant. He recommended Merck as one of the best to own, as well as Pfizer, Celgene, Allergan and Walgreens Boots Alliance. Cramer isn't alone in his enthusiasm for Trump's potential Veteran financial guru Larry Kudlow, who served as the Trump campaign's senior economic adviser, tells Newsmax TV that Trump will live up to his campaign vows to restore prosperity to all Americans and the nation we all love. "Donald Trump has a very strong economic growth message which is going to be great for the economy and for profits and for businesses large and small," Kudlow said Wednesday to Steve Malzberg on "America Talks Live." Kudlow, a Newsmax Finance Insider and CNBC senior contributor, said the billionaire real-estate tycoon was successful because he understands the dissatisfaction of "ordinary middle-class folk." "With Mr. Trump you're going to have across the board tax cuts, you're going to end Obamacare, which is a prosperity killer and a healthcare killer, you're going to take the handcuffs off of energy, you're going to wall back all these regulations and you're going to stop the government from taking over the economy. That's a powerful message," Kudlow said. Trump "understood that they were angry and that the establishment in Washington and elsewhere was not delivering. He understood that they wanted change and he understood that they wanted to drain the swamp, get rid of the corruption, stop the corporate cronyism," Kudlow said. "He understood that instinctively and he knew that people were not willing to give up the American dream … I think it was effective and I think he hit it exactly right. He just understood the American people in a way that no other political figure has understood it." Trump's proposed policies such as tax cuts, higher fiscal spending and simplifying regulation are likely to benefit sectors such as banks and industrials. Trump has sided with leading conservatives in calling for the repeal of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Financial Reform Act largely opposed by banks. "The Trump campaign did say it would repeal Dodd-Frank. Rates are higher and the yield curve is steeper. Those are all good things for the banks," Warren West, principal at Greentree Brokerage Services in Philadelphia, told Reuters.  But the possibility of Trump slapping punitive tariffs on exports from some countries such as China has unnerved some investors. "The markets are adjusting to a new reality and are giving Trump the benefit of doubt," said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer of Sarhan Capital. "He does have some problems with immigration and with social issues, but his economic policies, at least in the short-term, are perceived to be stimulative and net good for the economy and that's why stocks are rallying."

Which new therapies do KOLs expect to help most? Deeper understanding required: Some KOLs believe that better physical and molecular classification of CRC, combined with increased use of biomarkers, may have more of an impact than new medicines. Outlook unclear for anti-VEGFs and EGFR inhibitors: KOLs are split on whether these backbone therapies will see continued widespread use as front-line and later line treatments respectively. What will determine their positions in the treatment algorithm? KOLs enthusiastic about PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors: Although some note that immunotherapies like Keytruda and Tecentriq are most effective in a small subset of patients. How are they likely to be used? New combinations on the horizon: While chemotherapy-backed combinations are widely used in CRC, some KOLs believe targeted therapy combinations may prove more effective for many patients. Hunger for alternative treatments: KOLs are upbeat about novel mechanisms of action—but not all of them. Which pipeline therapies are they most excited about? Which ones are they most sceptical of? Mixed feelings about biosimilar bevacizumab: With at least six Avastin biosimilars on the way, KOLs are cautiously optimistic. What are their concerns, and what will biosimilars have to show to achieve widespread uptake? Cost concerns are mounting: KOLs anticipate that new CRC treatments will come with a high price tag. How will that affect treatment and regulatory decisions?

Some say novel therapies are the key. Others argue that a deeper understanding of the disease may have more of an impact by enabling personalised treatments. Find out how the treatment algorithm is likely to evolve over the next five years in KOL Insight: Colorectal Cancer. You'll get 12 North American and European KOLs' candid thoughts on 6 recently marketed CRC treatments and 13 more currently in the pipeline. Discover how PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, BRAF/MEK inhibitors, and other new therapies are likely to be used, how they'll affect current mainstays such as anti-VEGF therapies and EGFR inhibitors, and which new combination therapies show the most promise. Download sample pages "I think the lesson we have learnt in colon cancer is that if we want to push the survival number up and up and up, we have to think of ways of combining different strategies."

Plus 8 more - download the full list now > Top Takeaways Unmet need is the #1 concern: Many CRC subtypes have a poor prognosis. Which patient population represents the greatest unmet need? Which new therapies do KOLs expect to help most? Deeper understanding required: Some KOLs believe that better physical and molecular classification of CRC, combined with increased use of biomarkers, may have more of an impact than new medicines. Outlook unclear for anti-VEGFs and EGFR inhibitors: KOLs are split on whether these backbone therapies will see continued widespread use as front-line and later line treatments respectively. What will determine their positions in the treatment algorithm? KOLs enthusiastic about PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors: Although some note that immunotherapies like Keytruda and Tecentriq are most effective in a small subset of patients. How are they likely to be used? New combinations on the horizon: While chemotherapy-backed combinations are widely used in CRC, some KOLs believe targeted therapy combinations may prove more effective for many patients. Hunger for alternative treatments: KOLs are upbeat about novel mechanisms of action—but not all of them. Which pipeline therapies are they most excited about? Which ones are they most sceptical of? Mixed feelings about biosimilar bevacizumab: With at least six Avastin biosimilars on the way, KOLs are cautiously optimistic. What are their concerns, and what will biosimilars have to show to achieve widespread uptake? Cost concerns are mounting: KOLs anticipate that new CRC treatments will come with a high price tag. How will that affect treatment and regulatory decisions?

2016 /PRNewswire/ -- With more than five million Americans living with Alzheimer's disease and more than 10 million caring for someone with Alzheimer's, nearly everyone knows someone affected by this irreversible, heartbreaking disease. During National Alzheimer's Awareness Month and National Family Caregivers Month, Dr. Juebin Huang, MD, PhD and Assistant Professor of Neurology at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, provides guidance for those caring for a loved one with Alzheimer's disease on MerckManuals.com. Some of the insights Dr. Huang outlined in his article include: Understand the difference between dementia and Alzheimer's Distinguishing Alzheimer's disease from the varied effects of aging and related conditions remains challenging for patients and their families. Dementia is not a specific disease. Dementia is a term used to describe any slow, progressive decline in mental function, like memory or language, which is significant enough to disrupt an individual's daily activities. Although Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia, there are many other causes of dementia that a physician will consider. Be mindful of warning signs In older adults, it's not always easy to figure out which changes in memory and personality are parts of the natural aging process and which are signs of a more serious issue. While family members most commonly point to signs of forgetfulness in aging loved ones, doctors considering an Alzheimer's diagnosis will also look for other warning signs, including: A decline in carrying out daily functions like balancing a checkbook A lack of interest in hobbies Reluctance to leave the house Difficulty keeping up with conversations. Monitor progression Caregivers are often the first to notice warning signs and may be the ones to push for the first doctor visit. However, these issues typically develop very slowly and are very subtle at first. It's common for individuals to not remember exactly when they started experiencing symptoms. It can be years before a person seeks medical treatment, which makes establishing a timeline and predicting the progression difficult for doctors. Once treatment has begun, caregivers can be more accurate and objective in describing symptoms to doctors. Help loved ones maintain their normal daily functions Caregivers play a crucial role in helping patients maintain their day-to-day lives. Maintaining household chores, social interactions, and physical activities are especially important.  In the relatively early stages of Alzheimer's disease, caregivers should encourage their loved ones to continue regular activities, while also monitoring to ensure these activities don't become dangerous to the affected person or to others. Make sure you're cared for There may come a time when an Alzheimer's patient begins to challenge the caregiver and stops following instructions. As the person's behavior changes, caregivers must constantly shift their strategies and expectations. This is no easy feat. When a person with Alzheimer's disease is especially upset or confused, often the best approach is to relent enough to let the person calm down, then redirect the behavior later. It's important to remember that the person's condition is clouding their true intentions. The physical and emotional impact of caring for a loved one who is struggling with Alzheimer's disease can be overwhelming. Many doctors' offices have social workers available to talk to caregivers and direct them to additional resources and support. Resources are also available online, like the services offered by the Alzheimer's Association, Alzheimer's Disease International and Alzheimer's Foundation of America.

About the Author Milad Nourmohammadi is an associate data analyst for Morningstar. Contact Author | Meet other investing specialists The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 started the morning in the green and are on track for their best week of the year, though increased volatility in prices may change their direction throughout the day. The Dow surged to a new all-time intraday record soon after the markets opened, while the S&P has made strides of its own and looks to close in on its record with financials and bank stocks leading the way. Copper prices are also making leaps, as investors are now expecting a sharp increase in infrastructure projects under Trump. Thursday marked the strongest gain for copper in more than a year. Industrial metals will continue to jump in price under market expectations that there will be an imminent advance in infrastructure improvement within the country.   Stocks on the Move Pharmaceutical companies have experienced gains since Trump's election.  Pfizer  , along with its rival  Merck  , opened Thursday in the green again. While drugmakers would have likely stumbled under a Hillary Clinton administration, Trump has made it clear that his healthcare policy will lead to less regulations on drug prices.   Despite missing third-quarter analysts' projections,  Macy's  shares are up on Thursday. After an initial drop in premarket trading, shares of the company are trading in the green as the department store chain reaffirmed investors of its full-year earnings per share guidance and expects to see an increase in sales on owned and licensed items. Macy's appears to be continuing its plan of selling stores in an effort to drive more profitable growth--a factor likely to drive the company's shares even higher. Foreign Markets Asian shares rose higher on Thursday, as investors overseas had some time to digest a Trump presidency. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average rose sharply and finished Thursday up 6.72%, its biggest single-day gain since Feb. 15.    Japanese stocks leaped in part because of Trump's planned initiatives on infrastructure spending, which could benefit local infrastructure and industrial companies. China also saw its major indexes rise as the Shanghai Composite Index and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index finished Thursday's trading session up 1.37% and 1.89%, respectively. European share markets are following in similar fashion with the Stoxx Europe 600 Index looking to close out Thursday in the green for a fourth-straight session. The newfound opinions and assessments of Trump from global investors are certainly changing market outlooks. The German DAX 30 Index leaped on Thursday and is on pace for its highest close since December 2015.

The biggest problem is that he has not fleshed out the slogans, threats and vague promises made during his campaign. Winners The pharmaceutical industry should be happy Hillary Clinton is not heading for the White House given that she had promised to crack down on what she called “excessive price increases”. The shares of firms like Pfizer and Merck rallied in relief. Tech firms like Apple, Microsoft and Google owner Alphabet have kept billions of dollars of profits out of the US rather than pay the current 39 percent corporation tax. Trump has proposed a one-off 10 percent rate for repatriated cash. Fossil fuel firms could benefit given the president elect has said global warming is “a hoax”. So might mining companies, steel manufacturers and builders from his infrastructure spending promises. Losers The likely losers include renewable energy companies as the Trump victory threatens to reverse US energy and environmental priorities. He has also pledged to pull the US out of the Paris agreement to cut emissions and fight climate changes. Share of Danish firm Vestas, the world’s second-largest wind turbine producer, fell along with those of Spain’s Gamesa and Germany company Siemens. US carmakers who have plants in Mexico to take advantage of lower labour costs would lose out from Trump’s threats to impose tariffs on vehicles shipped north. Toyota, Nissan and Volkswagen would also be hit as they too have factories south of the border. Oil drillers. Gas pipelines. Coal. The defense industry. These are the likely winners of a Trump administration. https://t.co/Zd7lay5sYX— nzherald Business (@nzheraldbiz) November 10, 2016 Read my FX op-ed FX Winners & Losers after a Trump victory on CNBC https://t.co/CbNJz5rHNb .CNBC</a> .<a href="https://twitter.com/business">business GlobalFX</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/fx?src=hash">#fx</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/fxtrading?src=hash">#fxtrading</a></p>&mdash; Keith Underwood (Underwood_FX) November 9, 2016 Share this article: More about: Business Google Donald Trump Elections USA presidential elections 2016 All views Get a different perspective Every story can be told in many ways: see the perspectives from Euronews journalists in our other language teams.

Keris Alison Lahiff Nov 10, 2016 11:52 AM EST Wall Street ran at two speeds with the Dow Jones Industrial Average setting a record high earlier in the day while the Nasdaq plummeted into the red. Markets continued to trade erratically following Tuesday's election results. Pharmaceutical stocks including Merck  ( MRK) and Pfizer  ( PFE) were in rally mode after Democrats failed to secure the presidency and Republicans maintained control of the House and Senate. Democrats would likely have reined in rampant price gouging from pharmaceutical companies. Mylan  ( MYL) joined in on health care gains despite falling short of third-quarter earnings and sales estimates. The drugmaker swung to a loss in its recent quarter, largely tied to a multi-million dollar settlement with the DoJ. Shake Shack ( SHAK) jumped after lifting its full-year sales outlook. The burger chain also reported a more-than 40% increase in third-quarter revenue and nearly 3% increase in same-store sales. TheStreet's Keris Lahiff reports from Wall Street.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Ben Guarino November 10 Follow @bbguari After Donald Trump's many shifting comments about women's health and reproductive rights, some women are worried about what will happen under the new administration. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) As protesters burned a giant papier-mâché Trump head outside City Hall in Los Angeles and their East Coast counterparts torched an American flag in front of the Trump Tower in New York, America’s social media feeds lit up, too. Among those concerned were women who, worried about what the next four years could bode for reproductive health, pondered a lasting prophylactic measure. In the months before President-elect Donald Trump takes office, some advocates answered, consider long-term intrauterine devices or implanted contraceptive rods. It was a concern echoed in headlines of Elle, Glamour, Jezebel, Vogue, New York magazine and others. Writer Sophia Benoit told the Intercept that some two dozen women took her up on a Twitter offer, posted just before midnight Nov. 8, to discuss intrauterine devices. “I recommend the IUD right now especially because it’s long term, which with 20 million+ Americans potentially losing their health insurance and potentially right to an abortion, is important,” Benoit said. An IUD procedure consists of a doctor implanting the small, T-shaped device in a woman’s uterus. The devices kill sperm before they can fertilize an egg, and the contraceptives do so with high rates of success. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that hormonal implants fail at a rate of just 0.2 percent when properly used, and copper implants have a 0.8 percent failure rate. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommended IUDs to prevent teen pregnancies as “first line” contraceptives in 2014. Effective for 10 years, ParaGard, a copper-based IUD, could outlast two terms of a Trump administration. “It’s too early to tell if we’ll see an uptick in requests for IUDs as a result of the election,” Planned Parenthood’s Raegan McDonald-Mosley said in a statement to the Huffington Post. “While we truly hope that birth control methods will be available, accessible, and affordable to all women under the Trump administration, we understand people’s real concerns about losing access to birth control, which is basic health care for women.” Trump has not called for a ban on birth control. But he has promised to cut federal funding to Planned Parenthood, which offers a variety of birth control measures, including IUDs, in a pledge to antiabortion groups in the fall. Mark Harrington, director of antiabortion group Created Equal, told The Washington Post on Wednesday that the organization was calling on Trump to make good on his stance. [Trump victory inflates antiabortion movement] “We’re not going to allow, and we’re not going to fund, as long as you have the abortion going on at Planned Parenthood,” Trump said in March, just moments after complimenting the organization. “We understand that, and I’ve said it loud and clear.” A model holds Merck’s Nexplanon hormonal implant for birth control. (Merck via AP) On Wednesday, Planned Parenthood issued a response to Trump’s election. “Health care should not be political,” Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards said in a statement. “Every morning, Planned Parenthood health center staff across the country wake up and open their doors, as they have this morning, to care for anyone who needs them, regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation, gender, income, or country of origin.” Celebrities such as comedian Chelsea Handler came out to publicly defend women’s health organizations, too. “If you feel paralyzed today,” Handler tweeted, “Planned Parenthood and other groups are doing good work & need your support.” If you feel paralyzed today, Planned Parenthood @PPact and other groups are doing good work & need your support: https://t.co/34KHZXVNLN — Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) November 9, 2016 The Association of Reproductive Health Professionals notes that patients who choose IUDs report some of the highest rates of satisfaction among women who use birth control. But IUDs are not perfect, with side effects that include possible irregular bleeding, and a chance of increased menstrual bleeding in the case of the copper IUD. They vary in duration and cost, as high as $1,000 in out-of-pocket expenses for those who are uninsured. The Affordable Care Act — which Trump vowed to repeal — requires coverage of some forms of birth control, including intrauterine devices, by nearly all health insurance plans. Although Trump does not have a governing or voting record, his public statements in support of defunding Planned Parenthood are in line with what Vice President-elect Mike Pence supported during his time in Congress and tenure as governor of Indiana. Pence championed tight restrictions on abortion, including an Indiana law that declared “miscarried or aborted fetus must be interred or cremated.” In response, Indiana women created a group called “Periods for Pence” to inform the governor’s office whenever they were menstruating, on the chance their periods could potentially be miscarriages. Trump said during the presidential campaign that if abortion were made illegal, women who got the procedure should be punished for doing so — then he backtracked almost immediately and said only the doctor or any other person performing the illegal procedure should be punished.

Revenue growth is measured as organic growth in local currencies. Revenue from ALK's base business is defined as total revenue excluding income from the SLIT-tablet partnerships in North America and International markets). ALK continued to record double-digit sales growth in Europe in Q3. European sales and order intake exceeded expectations, driven by strong double-digit growth for SLIT-tablets and SLIT-drops. Overall margins softened following an expected decline of DKK 108 million in one-off milestone payments. -- Q3 total revenue, including partner income, amounted to DKK 630 million (667). Revenue in Q3 2015 included a DKK 112 million one-off milestone payment. -- Q3 revenue in the base business grew organically by 17% to DKK 614 million (534). -- ALK's base business saw strong sales growth for SLIT-tablets and SLIT-drops, while SCIT sales declined due to upgrade work on SCIT production in Europe, which has temporarily reduced SCIT production capacity. -- To meet demand during the forthcoming peak season, ALK will hire additional employees, primarily at the SLIT-drops production site in France. At the same time, ALK is expanding its North American organisation in support of the ongoing repatriation of the SLIT-tablets from MSD (known as Merck in the USA and Canada). -- ACARIZAX® is performing well during its introductory phase, consolidating its position in Denmark and Germany as the most prescribed product for new AIT initiations in adult patients with house dust mite allergy. ACARIZAX® was also recently launched in Slovakia, Sweden and Finland. -- Q3 operating profit (EBITDA) was DKK 121 million before special items (171). The EBITDA margin was 19% before special items (26%) as improved underlying profitability was offset by lower milestone payments. -- 9M total revenue was DKK 2,251 million (1,882) reflecting 30% growth in the base business. EBITDA before special items was DKK 584 million (329) and free cash flow was an inflow of DKK 198 million (an outflow of 149). Updated 2016 financial guidance ALK is updating its full-year guidance to reflect continued high orders in France which, from a revenue perspective, outweigh the impact of the upgrade work on SCIT production. -- Total full-year revenue is still projected to exceed DKK 2.9 billion including income from partnerships. -- Full-year revenue in the base business is now expected to grow organically by more than 20% versus previous guidance of ~20% growth. -- The new revenue guidance assumes that growth in the base business will be constrained by the ongoing upgrade of SCIT production which is estimated to reduce revenue by DKK 100-125 million, impacting the last four months of the year. Hence, the new guidance assumes low organic growth in the base business in Q4 2016 and a minor contribution from partnerships. Comparison with Q4 2015 is further affected by last year's significant sales growth resulting from a competitor's supply issues. -- Full-year EBITDA is now expected to exceed DKK 650 million before special items. Previous guidance stated >DKK 600 million. -- Free cash flow is now expected at DKK 100-150 million versus previous guidance of DKK 50-100 million.

Abstracts are available on the SITC 2016 conference website at: https://www.sitcancer.org/2016. Poster #127 Presentation time: Friday, November 11, 12:15-1:30 p.m. ET, 6:15-7:30 p.m. ET Title: Dual blockade of PD-1 and CTLA-4 with bispecific antibodies promotes human T cell activation and proliferation PD1 x CTLA4 bispecific antibody produced using Xencor’s bispecific platform Goal is selective targeting of PD1+CTLA4+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes for improved therapeutic window vs combination checkpoint blockade Superior T cell activation vs anti-PD1 by in vitro and in vivo studies Comparable activity to a combination of anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies Poster # 126 Presentation time: Saturday, November 12, 11:45-1:00 p.m. ET, 6:45-8:00 p.m. ET Title: Multiple bispecific checkpoint combinations enhance T cell activity PD1 x CTLA4, PD1 x LAG3, PD1 x BTLA, and CTLA4 x LAG3 bispecific antibodies produced using Xencor’s bispecific platform Goal is selective targeting of double-positive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes for improved therapeutic window vs combination checkpoint blockade All bispecifics enhance T cell activity in vitro and in vivo CTLA4 x LAG3 bispecific combines with anti-PD1 treatment for triple checkpoint blockade and strong T cell activation Posters are available on the investor relations section of the Xencor website under events and presentations at www.xencor.com. About Xencor’s XmAb® Bispecific Technology As opposed to traditional monoclonal antibodies that target and bind to a single antigen, bispecific antibodies are designed to elicit multiple biological effects that require simultaneous binding to two different antigen targets. Xencor’s XmAb bispecific Fc domain technology is designed to maintain full-length antibody properties in a bispecific antibody, potentially enabling favorable in vivo half-life and simplified manufacturing. Efforts at bispecific antibody design are typically frustrated by poor molecular stability, difficulties in production and short in vivo half-life. Xencor has engineered a series of Fc domain variants that spontaneously form stable, heterodimeric bispecific antibodies and that can be made and purified with standard antibody production methods. These bispecific Fc domains are used to generate a broad array of novel drug candidates in a range of molecule formats. About Xencor, Inc. Xencor is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing engineered monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, asthma and allergic diseases and cancer. Currently, 10 candidates engineered with Xencor’s XmAb® technology are in clinical development internally and with partners. Xencor’s internal programs include: XmAb5871 in Phase 2 development for the treatment of IgG4-Related Disease, and also for the treatment of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus; XmAb7195 in Phase 1 development for the treatment of asthma and allergic diseases; XmAb14045 in Phase 1 development for acute myeloid leukemia; and XmAb13676 for B-cell malignancies and XmAb18087 for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors, both in pre-clinical development. Xencor’s XmAb antibody engineering technology enables small changes to the structure of monoclonal antibodies resulting in new mechanisms of therapeutic action.  Xencor partners include Novartis, Amgen, MorphoSys, Merck, CSL/Janssen, Alexion, Novo Nordisk and Boehringer Ingelheim.

Bone marrow transplant procedure is recommended to treat severe stages of leukemia, Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, multiple myeloma, aplastic and sickle cell anemia, thalassemia etc. As per transplant activity report 2009-2013 from the Center for International Bone and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR), of a total of 88,063 bone marrow transplant procedures performed in the U.S., over 57% procedures were autologous bone marrow transplant procedures. The report covers the global bone marrow transplant market performance in terms of volume (procedural count) and revenue contribution. The report includes key trends, drivers, restraints, and opportunities influencing the growth of the global bone marrow transplant market over the forecast period. Impact analysis of key growth drivers and restraints, based on the weighted average model, are included to provide clients with crystal clear decision-making insights. The global bone marrow transplant market growth is mainly driven by factors such as growing prevalence of blood cancers across the globe, expansion of bone marrow transplant registry, growing investment in logistic services, and improvement in survival rate after treatment. Substantially high cost of treatment, lack of reimbursement policies in developing regions, and low availability of bone marrow donors are some factors hampering the growth of the global bone marrow transplant market. Based on procedure type, the bone marrow transplant market is segmented into autologous bone marrow transplant and allogeneic bone marrow transplant segments. By volume, the autologous bone marrow transplant segment accounted for the major proportion of the overall market share in 2014 and is expected to remain the dominant segment in terms of volume during the forecast period. By disease indication, the global bone marrow transplant market is classified as leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, myelodysplasia, myeloproliferative neoplasms, aplastic anemia, solid tumors, sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, and others. The leukemia segment is expected to dominate the market, accounting for a maximum share of the overall market by 2021 end; whereas, revenue from the thalassemia segment is projected to expand at the highest CAGR of 8.9% during the forecast period. On the basis of the end user, the global bone marrow transplant market is segmented into hospitals, multispecialty clinics, and ambulatory surgical centers (ASC). The hospital end user segment is expected to continue to be dominant, reaching a value of US$ 9,607.4 Mn by 2021 end. In terms of volume, adoption of bone marrow transplant procedures in ambulatory surgical centers is expected to increase by 1.3X globally over the forecast period. By region, the market in Europe is expected to be dominant in the global bone marrow transplant market in terms of volume throughout the forecast period. North America and Latin America markets are expected to gain significant market share over the forecast period, due to increasing ratio of BMT specialists to that of bone marrow transplant seeking patients in these regions. The MEA market is expected to witness sluggish growth during the forecast period partly due to the relatively low presence of bone marrow transplant centers. Key market players covered in this report include Lonza Group Ltd., Merck Millipore Corporation, Sanofi-Aventis LLC, AllCells LLC, STEMCELL Technologies and American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) Inc. Major players in the bone marrow transplant market are focusing on emerging markets instead of mature markets such as North America and Europe. These companies are more focused towards expanding their presence in clinical applications by introducing stem cell therapy products for use in humans. The global bone marrow transplant market is segmented as follows: By Procedure: Autologous Bone Marrow Transplant Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplant By Disease Indication: Leukemia Lymphoma Myeloma Myelodysplasia Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Aplastic Anemia Solid tumors Sickle cell Anemia Thalassemia Others By End User: Hospitals Multispecialty Clinics Ambulatory Surgical Centers By Region: North America U.S. Canada Europe Germany Italy France U.K. Spain Rest of Europe Asia Pacific China India Japan Australia & New Zealand Rest of Asia Pacific Latin America Mexico Brazil Argentina Rest of Latin America MEA GCC Countries South Africa Rest of MEA Key features included in this report: Drivers and restraints of the bone marrow transplant market Pipeline analysis and key developments in the market Analysis of business strategies of key players Bone marrow transplant market estimates and forecast Download the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/4039999/ About Reportbuyer Reportbuyer is a leading industry intelligence solution that provides all market research reports from top publishers http://www.reportbuyer.com   For more information: Sarah Smith Research Advisor at Reportbuyer.com Email: query@reportbuyer.com Tel: +44 208 816 85 48 Website: www.reportbuyer.com To view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-market-study-on-bone-marrow-transplant-latin-america-to-register-highest-growth-rate-by-2021-owing-to-increasing-density-of-bone-marrow-transplant-centers-persistence-market-research-300361216.html SOURCE ReportBuyer Related Links http://www.reportbuyer.com Nov 10, 2016, 20:50 ET Preview: Robo Advice In The UK and Europe - Revolution or Evolution?

Washington, D.C. (November 4, 2016) – The fifth annual BIO Patient and Health Advocacy Summit concluded today, bringing together 300 attendees representing over 200 organizations from patient advocacy, health care providers, academia, government, think tanks, professional societies and the biotechnology industry. The event provides a forum for lively discussions on timely health policy issues and best practices. Organized by the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), the event’s educational programming was designed to encourage thought-provoking discussion and to advance partnerships among stakeholders in the healthcare space. “This BIO patient advocacy summit has grown to include vastly diverse patient advocacy organizations on an international level. Patients’ perspectives are integral in the research and development of new treatment options,” said Paul Hastings, Chairman and CEO of OncoMed Pharmaceuticals and Chair of BIO’s Patient Advocacy Committee. “We look to continually engage with patient groups with strict adherence to BIO’s Guidelines for Patient Engagement to find innovative ways to incorporate all patients’ voices into the development of life-saving treatments. For the past five years, the Summit has provided an open forum for building invaluable partnerships among all stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem.” The Summit’s opening keynote luncheon began with remarks from Hastings and was followed by a town hall-style discussion that explored the potential implications of the upcoming Presidential and congressional races for health care delivery and access. Other deliberations throughout the conference centered on the patient’s voice in the reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA VI), patient perspectives in the development of value assessment frameworks, collaborations to incorporate patient perspectives throughout the life cycle of drug development and best practices around engagement with the provider and payor communities.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Merck Manuals Shares Advice and Resources for Alzheimer's Caregivers KENILWORTH, N.J., Nov. 10, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — With more than five million Americans living with Alzheimer’s disease and more than 10 million caring for someone with Alzheimer’s, nearly everyone knows someone affected by this irreversible, heartbreaking disease. During National Alzheimer’s Awareness Month and National Family Caregivers Month, Dr. Juebin Huang, MD, PhD and Assistant Professor of Neurology at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, provides guidance for those caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s disease on MerckManuals.com. Some of the insights Dr. Huang outlined in his article include: Understand the difference between dementia and Alzheimer’s Distinguishing Alzheimer’s disease from the varied effects of aging and related conditions remains challenging for patients and their families. Dementia is not a specific disease. Dementia is a term used to describe any slow, progressive decline in mental function, like memory or language, which is significant enough to disrupt an individual’s daily activities. Although Alzheimer’s disease is the most common type of dementia, there are many other causes of dementia that a physician will consider. Be mindful of warning signs In older adults, it’s not always easy to figure out which changes in memory and personality are parts of the natural aging process and which are signs of a more serious issue. While family members most commonly point to signs of forgetfulness in aging loved ones, doctors considering an Alzheimer’s diagnosis will also look for other warning signs, including: A decline in carrying out daily functions like balancing a checkbook A lack of interest in hobbies Reluctance to leave the house Difficulty keeping up with conversations. Monitor progression Caregivers are often the first to notice warning signs and may be the ones to push for the first doctor visit. However, these issues typically develop very slowly and are very subtle at first. It’s common for individuals to not remember exactly when they started experiencing symptoms. It can be years before a person seeks medical treatment, which makes establishing a timeline and predicting the progression difficult for doctors. Once treatment has begun, caregivers can be more accurate and objective in describing symptoms to doctors. Help loved ones maintain their normal daily functions Caregivers play a crucial role in helping patients maintain their day-to-day lives. Maintaining household chores, social interactions, and physical activities are especially important.  In the relatively early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, caregivers should encourage their loved ones to continue regular activities, while also monitoring to ensure these activities don’t become dangerous to the affected person or to others. Make sure you’re cared for There may come a time when an Alzheimer’s patient begins to challenge the caregiver and stops following instructions. As the person’s behavior changes, caregivers must constantly shift their strategies and expectations. This is no easy feat. When a person with Alzheimer’s disease is especially upset or confused, often the best approach is to relent enough to let the person calm down, then redirect the behavior later. It’s important to remember that the person’s condition is clouding their true intentions. The physical and emotional impact of caring for a loved one who is struggling with Alzheimer’s disease can be overwhelming. Many doctors’ offices have social workers available to talk to caregivers and direct them to additional resources and support. Resources are also available online, like the services offered by the Alzheimer’s Association, Alzheimer’s Disease International and Alzheimer’s Foundation of America. About The Merck Manuals First published in 1899 as a small reference book for physicians and pharmacists, The Merck Manual grew in size and scope to become one of the world’s most widely used comprehensive medical resources for professionals and consumers. As The Manual evolved, it continually expanded the reach and depth of its offerings to reflect the mission of providing the best medical information to a wide cross-section of users, including medical professionals and students, veterinarians and veterinary students, and consumers.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Donald Trump’s unlikely rise to power is providing a shot in the arm for global financial markets, with stocks and metals rallying on optimism that his fiscal-stimulus plans will boost the economy. Bonds tumbled. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared to a record high and the MSCI All Country World Index erased its monthly decline and  Copper posted its biggest back-to-back surge in three years, gaining alongside lead, zinc, tin and aluminum. The dollar rose against most major peers, while government bonds extended their selloff as Trump’s win bolstered bets on faster inflation. Latin American equities, debt and currencies plunged on speculation that higher U.S. interest rates would damp the appeal of riskier emerging-market securities. Traders are betting Trump will lower taxes, ease corporate regulation and ramp up spending to spur the world’s largest economy. He’s pledged to at least double the $275 billion five-year building plans of Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, while saying infrastructure will become “second to none” with millions working on projects. A statement posted on the president elect’s official transition website said the new administration will replace the Dodd-Frank Act financial-sector law with pro-growth policies. “People are going through the possibilities about what Washington looks like today and what Washington can do or not do for them,” said John Manley, who helps oversee about $233 billion as chief equity strategist for Wells Fargo Funds Management in New York. “Corporations feel there’s a less restrictive hand. People may take that as a positive.” Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard and his San Francisco counterpart John Williams stressed the importance of the central bank’s independence from political influence. Questions remain, however, over Trump’s attitude toward Chair Janet Yellen, whom he accused of holding rates low to aid Democratic President Barack Obama. Traders see an 84 percent chance of rate hike next month, according to federal funds futures pricing. “I am not seeing enough volatility here to change my basic projection for the economy,” Bullard said Thursday. “I think we are basically on track, the same way we were before the election. Our view has called for a single rate increase and I think December would be a reasonable time to implement that increase.” Stocks MSCI’s global gauge rose 0.2 percent at 4 p.m. in New York. The S&P 500 added 0.2 percent to 2,167.61, and the Dow Average jumped 219 points. Some of the biggest technology companies from Apple Inc. to Microsoft Corp. sent the Nasdaq Composite Index down. Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 Index extended a five-day rally to 8.2 percent. Banks and health-care shares surged on bets a Trump administration will roll back regulatory scrutiny of the industries. Industrial shares rallied as the Republican plans to boost infrastructure spending. Utility and real-estate stocks tumbled as a rout in bonds pushed yields higher, damping demand for the shares’ relatively high dividend payouts. “Yields are moving their way higher, that’s good for banks,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist and director of research for Wunderlich Securities in Boston. “If there’s going to be a friendlier regulatory environment that’s going to be good for banks. That’s the tailwind behind financials we haven’t seen for a long time.” Elsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 Index erased gains as a slide in utility and real-estate shares outweighed a rally in financial companies. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index dropped to the lowest since August, with benchmarks in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil slumping at least 3.2 percent. Russian shares rallied for a third day on speculation that a new U.S. government will mend its ties with Moscow. Bonds Benchmark 10-year note yields rose eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 2.14 percent, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. They were on course for the highest level since January. The yield on 30-year bonds increased 10 basis points to 2.95 percent, after jumping the most since October 2011 Wednesday. Treasury’s $15 billion 30-year debt auction Thursday again showed waning investor appetite for U.S. debt as Trump is seen ramping up spending to boost the economy, potentially widening the budget deficit and stoking inflation. Investors from Pacific Investment Management Co. to TIAA Global Asset Management see the surge in long-term U.S. Treasury yields as a sign inflation will in fact be on the rise. That means the long-dormant part of the Fed’s dual mandate could force policy makers to act more swiftly to raise borrowing costs than they have in 2016. “We see a higher and more balanced inflation forecast and more rapid normalization of policy,” Scott Mather, chief investment officer for core strategies at Pimco, wrote in a note. “This means the Fed will move faster on rate increases than the market had been pricing for in the year ahead,” he said, adding that he expects “two to three rate hikes before the end of 2017.” In Europe, Italian 10-year yields climbed to their highest in almost 14 months, coming under particular pressure amid concern December’s constitutional referendum may be the next vehicle for a growing anti-establishment mood. In France, where elections are due in 2017, yields also surged. Latin America was the highlight among emerging markets, with the cost to hedge against losses in bonds from Argentina and Brazil rising the most among major economies. Currencies The dollar surged to the strongest level since March as Trump’s proposals are seen by economists as inflationary and leading to higher U.S. interest rates. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index advanced 0.6 percent. The greenback rose 1 percent to 106.68 yen, touching the highest since July, and added 0.1 percent to $1.0900 per euro. “The dollar will do very well” on a broad trade-weighted basis in the next 12 months, Bilal Hafeez, global head of foreign-exchange research at Nomura Holdings Inc. in London, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. “The Fed will be increasing interest rates, the U.S. will be engaging in fiscal stimulus of some kind, which is much-needed by economies around the world, so we’ll have faster growth and more inflationary pressures.” Meanwhile, Latin American currencies tumbled on concern that Trump’s administration could usher in a host of protectionist measures after he campaigned on a pledge to protect American workers and companies from unfair trade deals. A trade war would be a blow to economies such as Mexico, which gets 80 percent of its overseas sales from the U.S., and others in the region that depend on exports. Brazil’s real plunged the most in five years, while Colombia’s and Mexico’s currencies each fell more than 3.7 percent. Commodities Most industrial metals rallied on speculation that commodities used to build everything from airports to bridges will benefit under Trump’s presidency. “The clearest message delivered by Donald Trump in his election victory speech was a focus on greater infrastructure spending in the U.S.,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts including Damien Courvalin and Jeffrey Currie said in a Nov. 9 report. “Without specific details it is hard to quantify the impact on commodity demand, however such policies would support steel, iron ore, zinc, nickel, diesel and cement.” Copper for delivery in three months jumped 3.5 percent to $5,601 a metric ton ($2.54 a pound) on the London Metal Exchange, after hitting a 16-month high. That’s pushed up the relative strength index to 90, the highest since data began in 1986. A reading over 70 suggests an asset is overbought. As optimism mounts that Trump’s plans will boost global growth, investors are unwinding options that give holders the right to buy December gold futures at higher prices, with the most-active call slumping for a fourth straight day. Contracts for December delivery fell 0.6 percent to settle at $1,266.40 an ounce on the Comex in New York. Oil fell after the International Energy Agency said prices may retreat amid “relentless global supply growth” unless OPEC enacts significant output cuts. West Texas Intermediate for December delivery fell 1.4 percent to $44.66 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent for January settlement slipped 1.1 percent to $45.84 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.   © 2016 Thomson/Reuters. All rights reserved.

The Nasdaq opened in positive territory but fell as much as 2 per cent, even as the blue-chip Dow index lingered in record territory. Near 1610 GMT, the Nasdaq was down 1.4 per cent to 5,178.03. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.3 per cent at 18,643.99, while the broad-based S&P 500 slipped 0.4 per cent to 2,153.69. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities, said Trump stance during the campaign created concerns about how new policies could affect the technology sector. "The rhetoric around the large technology companies is neutral to negative," Hogan said. "If we ever get back to that rhetoric that's more protectionist, that doesn't help people that manufacture a bunch of their products overseas, or companies that are putting smaller companies out of business. "I wouldn't say 'exacting revenge,' but if you listened to what you heard on the campaign trail, you could certainly make a case that there's not a clear discernible tail wind for these large cap technology companies. Hogan noted that many prominent Silicon Valley executives publicly backed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. And Trump attacked Apple directly after it refused to cooperate with intelligence experts seeking help in accessing a mobile phone. Trump also went after Amazon for its business practics, as well as Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos. Bezos owns the Washington Post, which sharply criticized Trump throughout the campaign. Apple fell 3.3 per cent, Amazon 4.3 per cent, Google parent Alphabet 3.3 per cent, Facebook 4.7 per cent and Microsoft 3.3 per cent. JPMorgan Chase jumped 3.5 per cent and Pfizer rose 4.1 per cent. Caterpillar, which is expected to prosper from ramped-up public works spending, rose 2.5 per cent. Nasdaq's move lower marked a reversal from the initial market reaction yesterday when the three major indices rallied. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

However, Tuesday was also a landmark day for the marijuana legalization movement. Marijuana scored medical and/or recreational victories in eight of the nine states that voted on the issue, tremendous news for the industry. Pharma, Weed Policies And Trump To compound the good for pharma stocks working on cannabinoid drugs, Trump’s election provided a major boost to the drug industry as well. One of the central issues of Hillary Clinton’s campaign was drug pricing, but it doesn’t seem to be a priority for Trump. Publicly Traded Pot Stocks Go High Marijuana drug companies GW Pharmaceuticals PLC – ADR (NASDAQ: GWPH) and Zynerba Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ: ZYNE) gained 6.0 percent and 3.0 percent, respectively, on Wednesday. Both stocks appeared poised to open Thursday’s session slightly higher as well. These pharma stocks traded mostly in line with non-marijuana pharma stocks like Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), which gained 6.5 percent and 7.1 percent, respectively, on Trump's election. While the election results were good news for marijuana drug stocks, other marijuana traders took the opportunity to cash in on huge 2016 gains. The MJIC U.S. Reporting Marijuana Index closed Wednesday’s session mostly flat but near 52-week highs. When asked about the situation, 420 Investor Alan Brochstein told Benzinga, "Biotech rally, though there has been some speculation that the new President, with control of Congress, could be negative for state-legal cannabis." Over-The-Counter Cannabis Stocks Sell Off Red hot marijuana stocks such as Kush Bottles Inc (OTC: KSHB), Cannabics Pharmaceuticals Inc (OTC: CNBX) and Cannabis Sativa Inc (OTC: CBDS) weighed heavily on the index, each selling off more than 10 percent on Wednesday as traders locked in massive 2016 gains.

Investors' initial fears were eased by Trump's inclusive victory speech and some of his policy plans, such as increased infrastructure and military spending as well as repealing landmark health care and financial reform laws, boosted stocks in several key sectors. Credit markets reflected more nervousness. Yield on many bonds, including U.S. Treasury securities, rose amid concerns that budget deficits might increase, and push up borrowing costs, if Trump pursues some spending programs and tax cuts he discussed during the campaign. The Dow Jones industrial shot up 256.95 points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 18,589.69, near August's record high after a relatively calm open. The rally came after an 800-point plunge in overnight futures as Trump's victory became apparent early Wednesday, after investors somewhat duplicated the initial market turmoil and quick recovery that followed the stunning vote in Britain in June to leave the European Union. The Nasdaq and the Standard & Poor's 500 rose about 1.1 percent after similar steep futures declines. "Markets tend to assume the worst and react immediately," Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, said in a note to clients before the opening bell Wednesday. "Expect an immediate market pullback on fear, and then a pause." As with the surprise "Brexit" vote, when Britain voted in June to leave the European Union, part of the market's turmoil reflected money managers having guessed incorrectly on the outcome of the election. "Markets tend to have knee-jerk reactions to these kind of situations" and in this case investors also "had all but priced-in a (Hillary) Clinton victory," Nigel Green, chief executive of the financial advisory firm DeVere Group in London, said in a statement. Major stock indexes had fallen around the globe as world markets digested Trump's victory. Japan's Nikkei index fell more than 5 percent overnight but major European indexes turned positive later Wednesday recovering from sharper declines earlier in the day. Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com, said Trump's inclusive victory speech helped calm markets -- for now. "It's a knee-jerk reaction in both cases, first to the shocking election outcome second to the very tempered speech that President-elect Trump had given in acceptance," McBride said. "In neither case are the multitude of questions outstanding answered," he said, adding that Trump was "deliberately vague" on specific policy positions during the campaign. "So in the face of unanswered questions, I would expect very choppy waters in financial markets over the coming weeks and months," McBride said. There was confusion in the credit markets, too. Prices of many U.S. Treasury securities -- typically one of the safe havens that investors seek in volatile times -- fell in early trading Wednesday, driving their yields higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, jumped to 2.06 percent -- the highest since January -- from 1.85 percent on Tuesday. "I don't think the bond markets have a good handle on the implications of the events of last night, so they're pricing in the potential for greater risk," said Guy LeBas, head of fixed-income strategy at the investment firm Janney Montgomery Scott. "If you look at the proto-policies that Trump has referenced, including possibly renegotiating the U.S. debt and running a massive deficit, while those outcomes are by no means certain that enhances the risk of Treasury securities," LeBas said. McBride said short-term bond prices fell because investors believe Federal Reserve policymakers are less likely to nudge up interest rates next month in the wake of Trump's victory. Long-term bond yields were up because Trump used his speech in part to tout plans for more infrastructure spending, "which portends bigger deficits and debt," McBride said. Stocks in certain sectors rallied on speculation that Trump's proposals eventually would boost the companies' growth. Big bank stocks surged with the expectation of less financial regulation and construction and heavy equipment companies rallied on Trump's expected push for more federal spending on roads, airports and other infrastructure. "We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals," Trump said in his early morning victory speech. "We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it." There is bipartisan backing for increased infrastructure spending. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton also wanted more such spending and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Wednesday that "we can work together to pass a robust infrastructure jobs bill." Consequently, Caterpillar Inc. stock was up about 7.7 percent Wednesday. And shares of Vulcan Materials Co., which produces asphalt and concrete mixes, shot up more than 10 percent. Aerospace and defense stocks also rose in response to Trump's promise to build up the U.S. military. Raytheon Co. surged about 8 percent in morning trading, Northrop Grumman Corp. jumped about 5.8 percent and Boeing Co. gained 2 percent. Drug stocks also shot higher with Trump vowing to repeal Obamacare and replace it with another national health care plan. Pfizer Inc. and Amgen Inc. both rose 6 percent and Merck & Co. was up 5.5 percent. But Trump's exact plans are still unclear, so investors should wait for more details, said Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets. "I think this is a very short-term bump," he said. (EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE) The Mexican peso was down about 8 percent against the dollar after plunging earlier Wednesday by more than 13 percent to a record low amid concerns about a Trump presidency. Trump has promised to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border to halt undocumented immigration. He also promised during the campaign to rewrite or scrap the 2-decade-old North American Free Trade Agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Investors also were concerned about the effect of Trump's victory on global trade. Trump has been highly critical of U.S. trade deals and adamantly opposes the proposed 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership pact with Asian nations. Those positions have raised fears among investors of a global trade war and a U.S. recession after Trump takes office. "Trump has proposed economic and trade policies which, if enacted, would represent a sharp departure from the status quo," HSBC Global Research said. "These include sharp cuts in income and business taxes, renegotiation of trade agreements and potential tariffs on goods imported from China and Mexico, and the large-scale deportation of illegal immigrants." Fitch Ratings said Trump's victory "does not have immediate near-term implications" for the federal government's AAA bond rating. But "Trump's economic and fiscal policies would be negative for U.S. sovereign creditworthiness if they were implemented in full," Fitch said.       Comments made about this article - 0 Total Comment on this article Title: Comments: Your Name: (optional - shown on website) Advertisement Subscribe to The Recorder   E-Edition 11/15/2016 Click here to see and download more print issues The Recorder Sports Schedule Most Popular Area high school sports calendar Thursday, November 10, 2016 Election results in Montgomery County update 3 Tuesday, November 08, 2016 Republicans take Legislature Wednesday, November 09, 2016 State news in brief Friday, November 11, 2016 WWII vet shares memories Friday, November 11, 2016 Mary Lou Abele Starace Wednesday, November 09, 2016 3 arrested for prostitution in Amsterdam Monday, November 14, 2016 Deborah L.

If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen The Dow Jones industrial average hit a record high on Thursday as investors bet that president-elect Donald Trump would lead a shift away from austerity policies. Investors are seeing Trump’s policies such higher defense and infrastructure spending, tax cuts and deregulation of banks and as being more business-friendly than Democrat Hillary Clinton’s position of maintaining status quo. Story continues below “The markets are adjusting to a new reality and are giving Trump the benefit of doubt,” said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer of Sarhan Capital. “He does have some problems with immigration and with social issues, but his economic policies, at least in the short-term, are perceived to be stimulative and net good for the economy and that’s why stocks are rallying.” READ MORE: U.S. election uncertainty taking a ‘toll’ on global markets The U.S. dollar jumped to a more than two-week high of 98.92, while gold turned flat as investors returned to riskier assets such as stocks. The Mexican peso continued its downward momentum against the dollar as Trump’s policies are considered deeply negative for the country. At 9:43 a.m. ET the Dow Jones industrial average was up 161.69 points, or 0.87 per cent, at 18,751.38. The S&P 500 was up 17.11 points, or 0.79 per cent, at 2,180.37. The index is less than 20 points shy of its record intraday high. The Nasdaq Composite index was up 45.40 points, or 0.86 per cent, at 5,296.47. Financial and healthcare stocks rose, continuing to hold their positions as the top performers among the 11 major S&P 500 sectors in the post-Trump victory rally. Consumer staples, utilities and real-estate – the defensive parts of the market – remained the big losers. As investors decipher what a Trump presidency would mean to the financial markets, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard repeated his call that a single interest rate increase would be adequate for the foreseeable future.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search US Election: How best to invest following Donald Trumps victory November 9, 2016 20:56 IST By IBTimes UK Close Embed <iframe src="http://www.ibtimes.co.in/tv/embed/42051" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> Following the surprising win of Republican candidate Donald Trump in the US presidential election, investors are today scratching their heads and trying to figure out what this means for the economy and for stock markets for the next four years. President-elect Trump has zero political experience, and thus his economic policies are more difficult to predict than with previous presidents-elect. Given the resounding majorities won by the Republican Party in both the US Senate and House of Representatives, the road is clear for the Republicans under Trump to pass new legislation for at least the next two years, when the US mid-term elections will be held. Greater government spending: Building and Infrastructure President Trump is likely to spend on infrastructure projects across America, including maintenance of road networks, improving airports and oil and gas pipelines. The most powerful economy in the world has surprisingly poor infrastructure, evident when you take a taxi out of Manhattan to New Yorks LaGuardia airport and experience the numerous potholes in the road. This infrastructure spending will benefit construction-related companies such as building company CRH (UK code: CRH), and equipment rental company Ashtead (code: AHT), both of which have huge exposure to the US. Greater government spending: Defence and Security Defence and security is a second area where President Trump is likely to spend more money, as this is a typical Republican policy priority. Homeland security is a very high priority if Trump is to deliver on many of his pledges to his voters. This higher defence and security spending should benefit suppliers to the US government such as BAe Systems (code: BA.). Good news for Health care The US and European healthcare sectors have suffered in the lead-up to this election on the basis that the favourite, Hillary Clinton, was likely to enact heavy price regulation on pharmaceutical companies in the US, limiting their profit-making ability. Over the year to date, US healthcare companies like Pfizer and Merck underperformed the benchmark S and P 500 index by 10% in the run-up to this election. Since Trumps victory, healthcare stocks have bounced by more than the market, starting to claw back some of this lost ground, as Trump is seen as being much more business-friendly to this industry than Hillary Clinton would have been. In the UK, Shire plc (code SHP) is a key member of the FTSE 100 index that has huge exposure to the US pharmaceutical market, made even greater through its recent acquisition of US company Baxalta. Policy uncertainty is probably not good news for government bonds With Donald Trump likely to increase government spending in order to make good on some of his populist promises to the US electorate, this extra spending is likely to result in more borrowing via bonds by the US government. The expectation of higher borrowing is already resulting in higher bond yields, and thus lower bond prices, not only for US Treasury bonds but also for UK gilts. So investors are likely to do better in the near-term focusing on healthcare, construction and defence/security stocks, and staying away from the gilt market until bond yields stabilise at higher levels.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid 1/2 left right Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., November 10, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid 2/2 By Noel Randewich U.S. banking sector shares on Thursday surged to levels not seen since the midst of the 2008 financial crisis, pushing the Dow to an all-time high, while technology shares sank as Wall Street rearranged its bets to benefit from Donald Trump's presidency. The S&P 500 financial sector .SPSY surged 3.70 percent to its highest since the 2008 financial crisis, bringing its gain since Trump's surprise victory in Tuesday's election to 7.9 percent, its biggest two-day gain since 2011. Shares of Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) jumped 7.58 percent to their highest since January, and have now erased all of the losses incurred in the wake of a scandal over fake accounts opened by its employees. Bank of America (BAC.N) surged 4.40 percent and JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) rallied 4.64 percent to a record high. Trump has sided with leading conservatives in calling for the repeal of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Financial Reform Act largely opposed by banks. "The Trump campaign did say it would repeal Dodd-Frank. Rates are higher and the yield curve is steeper. Those are all good things for the banks," said Warren West, principal at Greentree Brokerage Services in Philadelphia. Apple (AAPL.O) dropped 2.79 percent while Amazon.com (AMZN.O) fell 3.82 percent and the S&P 500 technology index .SPLRCT fell 1.59 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI jumped 1.17 percent to end at 18,807.88, smashing through its previous record high set in August by almost 1 percent. The S&P 500 .SPX rose 0.2 percent to 2,167.48 while the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 0.81 percent to 5,208.80, hurt by losses in tech shares. With Thursday's gain, the Dow is up 8 percent in 2016 and the S&P 500 is up 6 percent. High-dividend sectors utilities .SPLRCU, telecom services .SPLRCL and consumer staples .SPLRCS sold off by more than 2 percent as bond yields rose due to expectations of higher interest rates. The market got a lift after St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said the Republican sweep of the White House and Congress could break the current gridlock over national policy in a potential boon to the U.S. economy. Industrials .SPLRCI trailed the financials with a 2.05 percent advance. Macy's (M.N) rose 5.6 percent after the department store operator raised its full-year sales forecast and announced a partnership to monetize some of its real-estate assets. After the bell, Nordstrom (JWN.N) reported quarterly results that sent its shares 5 percent higher while Walt Disney's (DIS.N) quarterly report pushed its stock down 2.6 percent. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.15-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.58-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 84 new 52-week highs and seven new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 336 new highs and 48 new lows. About 12.3 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, far above the 7.3 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Allergic Rhinitis Market: Increasing Prevalence Rate of Allergy is Anticipated to Drive Global Market by 2026 2016-11-10 Print Tweet   In allergic rhinitis, the immune system identifies harmful substances known as allergens as an intruder. It is an Immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated disease. FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE According to American college of allergy, asthma and immunology allergic rhinitis mostly affect 40 million to 60 million Americans. Australian society of clinical immunology and allergy reported that allergic rhinitis affects 1 in 5 people in Australia and New Zealand. The increasing prevalence rate of allergy in both adult and children is anticipated to drive the global allergic rhinitis market. Consumers are also moving forward towards the use over-the-counter (OTC) products which are a trend in the global allergic rhinitis market. Based on the therapy, drugs are considered as the first line of therapy. With the help of immunotherapy, the body builds resistance to allergen and helps in the improvement of symptoms. Allergic rhinitis is the fifth most common chronic disease in the U.S. According to American Academy of Otolaryngology, allergic rhinitis affects 1 in every 6 Americans and generates about US$ 2 Bn to US$ 5 Bn in direct health expenditures annually. In 2014, National Health interview Survey (NHIS) demonstrated that 8.4% of children in U.S. under 18 years of age suffered hay fever. American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology mentioned that allergic rhinitis affects between 10% and 30% of the population. On the basis of regional presence, global allergic rhinitis market is segmented into five key regions viz. North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East & Africa. North America is expected to lead the allergic rhinitis market, as U.S. has the highest incidence of allergy. Asia Pacific market is anticipated to grow at the fastest growth rate during the forecast period, owing to factors such as increasing pollution especially in countries such as China, Japan, and India. Some of the major players in allergic rhinitis market are AstraZeneca, MEDA Pharmaceuticals Inc., Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Circassia Pharmaceuticals plc, Merck & Co., Inc., Sunovion pharmaceuticals Inc., UCB S.A., Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd, and Stallergenes Greer.

Nov 10, 2016, 08:00 ET Share this article NEW YORK and ANN ARBOR, Mich., Nov. 10, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Lycera Corp., a privately held biopharmaceutical company developing breakthrough immune modulatory medicines, today announced the expansion of its scientific advisory board (SAB) to include 11 renowned clinical researchers and scientists. The Company, which recently announced the initiation of its Phase 2 clinical trial of therapeutic candidate, LYC-30937-EC in patients with ulcerative colitis, is advancing a broad R&D pipeline of novel, oral immune modulators for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and cancer. "We are thrilled to announce our accomplished and distinguished group of scientific advisors, each of whom offers world-class experience in many of the most important and rapidly changing disciplines within the health sciences," said Paul Sekhri, President and CEO of Lycera. "Lycera is dedicated to developing innovative therapies for patients who need them, and our frequent interactions with our SAB members will be essential to the further advancement of these programs." Members of Lycera's scientific advisory board are focused on key aspects of biology, chemistry and clinical practice: Harinder Singh, PhD, (Chair), Director of the Division of Immunobiology and the Center for Systems Immunology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center Jonathan A. Ellman, PhD, Eugene Higgins Professor of Chemistry and Professor of Pharmacology, Yale University Sarah Gaffen, PhD, Gerald P.

This spirit is exemplified in the Company's lead program in immune-oncology where Lycera is advancing an agonist for RORgamma, thereby targeting a key control switch that can activate the immune system to destroy tumor cells.  This novel therapeutic is planned to enter clinical trials by the end of this year.  In parallel, the company is also developing an RORg antagonist for patients with autoimmune disease.  The dual, integrated RORgamma programs showcase Lycera's focus as well as spirit of innovation, which is being consistently applied throughout its promising pipeline," stated Dr. Singh.

Bristol-Myers' deepens focus on fibrosis with Nitto deal Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said on Thursday it agreed to pay Japan's Nitto Denko Corp $100 million up front for the right to its early-stage drug for liver fibrosis due to fatty liver disease NASH or hepatitis C. Fibrotic diseases are characterized by inflammation and subsequent formation of excess collagen in an organ or tissue, compromising function, and culminating in organ failure. Pfizer wins EU's approval for Ibrance as Novartis readies rival drug U.S. drugmaker Pfizer said on Wednesday it had won approval from the European Union for its best-selling breast cancer drug Ibrance, making it the first medicine of its kind to reach the European market. The decision, which had been expected following a positive recommendation from the European Medicines Agency in September, comes as Novartis readies a rival treatment called ribociclib. J&J vaccine plus Gilead immune booster shows promise as HIV fighter An experimental HIV vaccine from Johnson & Johnson combined with an immune system booster from Gilead Sciences Inc showed promise at keeping the virus at bay in monkeys even after treatments had stopped, marking yet another step toward the development of a so-called functional cure for HIV. Both companies are currently testing the products separately in early-stage trials in people with HIV. Bristol-Myers' Opdivo succeeds in key stomach cancer study Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said on Thursday its blockbuster immunotherapy Opdivo helped patients with advanced stomach cancer live longer in a late-stage study, becoming the first drug of its kind to show a survival benefit in these patients. Opdivo met the main study goal of overall survival in patients who failed to respond to or are intolerant of standard chemotherapy, the company said. Scientists develop new type of HIV test on a USB stick Scientists in Britain have developed a type of HIV test using a USB stick that can give a fast and highly accurate reading of how much virus is in a patient's blood. The device, created by scientists at Imperial College London and the privately-held U.S. firm DNA Electronics, uses a drop of blood to detect HIV, then creates an electrical signal that can be read by a computer, laptop or handheld device. Exclusive: Pfizer weighs sale or spin-off of consumer health unit - sources U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc is evaluating a potential sale or spin-off of its consumer health division that could value the unit at as much as $14 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. A Pfizer exit from the consumer health business, which includes lip balm Chapstick and painkiller Advil, would be one of its biggest corporate moves since abandoning a $160 billion deal to buy Irish drugmaker Allergan Inc earlier this year. Soda taxes spread after votes in four U.S. cities Three California cities voted for a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages and another in Colorado was likely to follow suit, unofficial election results showed on Wednesday, as local governments' push to cut soda consumption to stem obesity gathered speed. The votes on so-called soda taxes in San Francisco, Albany and Oakland in California and in Boulder, Colorado, came a month after the World Health Organization recommended governments impose such taxes to battle obesity, diabetes and other diet-related diseases. AstraZeneca drops early head and neck cancer drug plans AstraZeneca said on Thursday it had given up on the idea of seeking an early approval of its immunotherapy drug durvalumab in head and neck cancer using mid-stage Phase II clinical trials data. The move follows recent changes in the competitive landscape, which has seen Merck's similar Keytruda approved for the condition, reducing the case for special regulatory treatment of durvalumab. Perrigo to review options for Multiple Sclerosis drug Tysabri Perrigo Co Plc reported a higher-than-expected adjusted quarterly profit and said it would review strategic options for royalty rights from sales of multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri. Shares of the Dublin-based company, which specializes in generic and over-the-counter drugs, were up about 4 percent at $86.75 in premarket trading on Thursday. Torn lab suit used in Canada Ebola experiment faces review The Canadian government will review the use of a suit designed to shield laboratory workers from dangers such as the Ebola virus after an employee found a tear following an experiment, the lab's director said on Wednesday. The worker at the National Center for Foreign Animal Disease in Winnipeg may have been accidentally exposed to Ebola on Monday while handling pigs infected with Ebola in an experiment, government officials said on Tuesday.

The partners are due to begin their clinical trial collaboration before the end of the year, when they will combine Opdivo with Infinity's candidate IPI-549 to evaluate its potential for improving sustained efficacy and tolerability beyond the current standard of care. Preclinical data for IPI-549 - which is currently in phase I trials as a monotherapy - has suggested that the drug candidate may not only enhance the effects of checkpoint inhibitors like Opdivo, but also reverse tumour resistance. Designed to target immune cells, IPI-549 alters the immune-suppressive microenvironment that fosters tumour growth and promotes an anti-tumour immune response. Dr Fouad Namouni, head of oncology development at BMS, said: “Targeting the tumour microenvironment is an important part of our immuno-oncology strategy as we continue to advance research for cancers with limited treatment options. “Our agreement with Infinity builds on our continued focus to bring forward potential novel combination treatment options for patients with cancer.” With a view to treating all patients with advanced forms of solid tumours, the study will begin with trials in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), which account for 17% of all new cancer cases in the US each year. BMS will be looking to the combination therapy to give its PD-1 inhibitor an advantage in the hyper-competitive immuno-oncology market, particularly after Opdivo failed to outperform Merck & Co's Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in a first-line NSCLC study earlier this year. In that study Merck's Keytruda proved to better both progression-free and overall survival in NSCLC patients compared to standard chemotherapy and it was followed by an accelerated approval by the FDA last month. Meanwhile, Roche's own PD-1 inhibitor Tecentriq (atezolizumab) has also been approved in NSCLC albeit as a second-line therapy and is currently undergoing a phase III trial for first-line use.

By Edmund Shing November 10, 2016 11:12 GMT Close Embed Feed US Election: How best to invest following Donald Trump's victory IBTimes UK <iframe src="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/videos/embed/21526" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> Following the surprising win of Republican candidate Donald Trump in the US presidential election, investors are today scratching their heads and trying to figure out what this means for the economy and for stock markets for the next four years. President-elect Trump has zero political experience, and thus his economic policies are more difficult to predict than with previous presidents-elect. Given the resounding majorities won by the Republican Party in both the US Senate and House of Representatives, the road is clear for the Republicans under Trump to pass new legislation for at least the next two years, when the US mid-term elections will be held. Greater government spending: Building and Infrastructure Chart 1: Ashtead breaking out post US electionSource: Bloomberg.com President Trump is likely to spend on infrastructure projects across America, including maintenance of road networks, improving airports and oil and gas pipelines. The most powerful economy in the world has surprisingly poor infrastructure, evident when you take a taxi out of Manhattan to New York's LaGuardia airport and experience the numerous potholes in the road. This infrastructure spending will benefit construction-related companies such as building company CRH (UK code: CRH), and equipment rental company Ashtead (code: AHT), both of which have huge exposure to the US. Greater government spending: Defence and Security Defence and security is a second area where President Trump is likely to spend more money, as this is a typical Republican policy priority. Chart 2: BAe Systems enjoys Trump bumpSource: Bloomberg.com Homeland security is a very high priority if Trump is to deliver on many of his pledges to his voters. This higher defence and security spending should benefit suppliers to the US government such as BAe Systems (code: BA.). Good news for Health care The US and European healthcare sectors have suffered in the lead-up to this election on the basis that the favourite, Hillary Clinton, was likely to enact heavy price regulation on pharmaceutical companies in the US, limiting their profit-making ability. Over the year to date, US healthcare companies like Pfizer and Merck underperformed the benchmark S&P 500 index by 10% in the run-up to this election. Chart 3: US health care stocks have suffered from a fear of ClintonSource: Bloomberg.com Since Trump's victory, healthcare stocks have bounced by more than the market, starting to claw back some of this lost ground, as Trump is seen as being much more business-friendly to this industry than Hillary Clinton would have been. In the UK, Shire plc (code SHP) is a key member of the FTSE 100 index that has huge exposure to the US pharmaceutical market, made even greater through its recent acquisition of US company Baxalta. Chart 4: Shire continues to rebound strongly from start of 2016 lowsSource: Bloomberg.com Policy uncertainty is probably not good news for government bonds With Donald Trump likely to increase government spending in order to make good on some of his populist promises to the US electorate, this extra spending is likely to result in more borrowing via bonds by the US government. The expectation of higher borrowing is already resulting in higher bond yields, and thus lower bond prices, not only for US Treasury bonds but also for UK gilts. So investors are likely to do better in the near-term focusing on healthcare, construction and defence/security stocks, and staying away from the gilt market until bond yields stabilise at higher levels.

The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.22%  rose 4.22 points, or 0.2% to end at 2,167.48. “Trump made rebuilding the nation’s infrastructure a centerpiece of his campaign. As such, the market is expecting an emphasis on fiscal spending initiatives to jump-start the economy,” said Michael Reilly, chief investment officer for equities at TCW. Read: Trump stock rally signals new era of fiscal stimulus The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.59%  trimmed losses but fell 42.28 points, or 0.8%, to close at 5,208.80. It was down more than 100 points at one point during the session. “We are witnessing the unwind of the ‘presidential trade,’” said Ian Winer, director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities, referring to the decline in tech shares. Investors had largely positioned themselves for a win by Hillary Clinton but were forced to adjust portfolios quickly in the wake of the stunning Trump upset, he said. The Nasdaq is heavily weighted toward technology names, which were among the weakest sectors of the day, off about 2.2%. Among the top decliners of the space, Qualcomm Inc. QCOM, +0.80%  fell 2.3% while Broadcom Ltd. AVGO, +1.54%  lost 3.2% and Facebook Inc. FB, +1.35%  dropped 1.9%. “If I am a portfolio manager and need to move my exposures quickly, I sell big cap techs to raise money,” Winer said. “The number of investors who have called me asking me about this trade and the clear pain out there tells me that we are in the seventh inning of this unwind.” The volatility isn’t surprising since investors were expected to continue digesting Trump’s historic victory and the impact it could have on economic policy, strategists said. Although some feared a win for the Republican candidate would spark severe market volatility, stocks shook off their initial jitters and closed higher in Europe and the U.S. on Wednesday. “There was an initial reaction to speculation on issues like fiscal stimulation, for example, but as we get into the coming days and weeks, we’ll need to rethink a lot of our initial reactions,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank. “There are a lot of things we don’t know, and while it’s tempting to speculate, we need more evidence before we know whether we should zig or zag.” Trump’s presidency is seen as potentially providing a boost to financial and industrial stocks, partly because of his plan to increase fiscal spending to fund infrastructure projects. If instituted, that will benefit construction companies, as well as help banks because bond yields are expected to rise. A possible move toward lighter regulation is also seen helping financial firms. Shares in those sectors were the biggest advancers on Wednesday, and they continued higher on Thursday. Caterpillar Inc. CAT, -0.52%  rose 2.5%, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, -0.14%  and Bank of America Corp. BAC, -0.85%  both advanced more than 4%. Pharmaceutical stocks also gained on the prospect that a Trump administration will be less restrictive on drug pricing than Clinton might have been. Shares of Pfizer Inc. PFE, -1.00%  shares rallied 4.3% and Merck & Co. MRK, -0.31%  shares advanced 1.2%. Macy’s Inc. M, -0.79%  reported third-quarter earnings that fell from the prior year and missed expectations. Still, shares of the company jumped 5.6%. Among other markets, Asian stocks also rebounded sharply. The Nikkei 225 index NIK, -0.03%  closed 6.7% higher for its biggest gain since February while European stocks were mostly lower. The ICE Dollar Index DXY, +0.20%  rose 0.3%, recovering from a 0.2% loss on Wednesday, and the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, -1.80%  fell further with the yield rising 8.22 basis points to 2.137% after a dramatic jump in the previous session. Michael Moore joins NYC anti-Trump protest(1:00) The filmmaker joined a group of protesters on the streets of Manhattan on Wednesday evening. Economic news: First-time jobless claims fell more than expected in the latest week, keeping the rate of layoffs near the lowest levels in decades. Other markets: Oil turned lower after the International Energy Agency warned of “relentless” growth in oil supply in 2017. Crude CLZ6, +4.57%  slid more than 1% and gold GCZ6, +0.22%  extended losses following Wednesday’s choppy session. --Sara Sjolin contributed to this report.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Fc Protein and Glycoengineered Antibodies Market (2nd Edition), 2016 – 2026 LONDON, Nov. 10, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — INTRODUCTION Developed through introduction of modifications in monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), antibody based therapeutics are gaining increased attention from both large and small pharmaceutical companies. The Y-arm of the antibody is known as Fab, comprising a constant and a variable domain from each light and heavy chain. The variable domain (Fv) within the Fab region is responsible for target specificity and binding affinity whereas the base of the antibody, known as the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region, is responsible for interaction with immune cells. Modifications made in the Fc region can alter its effector functions. The key changes made in the Fc domain to improve the effector functions include glycoengineering, protein engineering or isotype chimerism. This can result in improvement in the ADCC activity, CDC activity, ADCP activity and half-life of the molecule. The concept of engineered antibodies is widely being used for development for biobetters/biosimilars, addressing the drawbacks of their ancestor drug candidates. Several players have developed and made available their proprietary technologies for production of such engineered antibodies. This has encouraged and opened an opportunity for a large amount of licensing activity in this domain, building a strong collaborative network of small and big pharmaceutical companies. Currently, two drugs, namely Gazyva® and POTELIGEO®, are commercially available. A number of molecules are being tested primarily for oncological indications; in addition, a limited set of molecules are also being developed for non-oncological indications such as asthma, COPD, neuromyelitis optica, ulcerative colitis and hemolytic disease in the newborn. Such initiatives suggest that the overall market is likely to hold a strong potential in the coming years. SCOPE OF THE REPORT The “Fc Protein and Glycoengineered Antibodies Market (2nd Edition), 2016-2026” report was commissioned to examine the various aspects of engineering an antibody to develop novel drugs for addressing several oncology and non-oncological disorders. This market has steadily evolved over the last few years. The report examines several elements of developing these next generation antibodies, such as the technologies used for their production, site of engineering in an antibody and a robust landscape in the form of clinical / preclinical pipeline. For the purposes of this report, engineered antibodies are defined as antibodies that have been modified in their Fc region. The two types of modification considered include: – Fc Glycoengineering (referred to as ‘Glycoengineering’ in the report) – Fc Protein engineering As pharmaceutical companies continue to initiate and expand their research programs in this area, one of the key objectives outlined for this report was to understand the future potential of the market. This was done by analyzing: – The Fc protein and glycoengineered antibody pipeline in terms of phase of development, type of therapy (monotherapy or combination therapy) and target indications. – Technologies established by various players for development of engineered antibody therapeutics including the key mechanism involved, licencing activity, advantages and the molecules being developed using the technology. – Partnerships that have taken place in the recent past covering technology licensing, product development and commercialization agreements, clinical trial collaborations, product license agreements, acquisitions and other relevant agreements. – Inherent threats to growth in the short and long term. – The likely adoption of the Fc protein and glycoengineered antibodies by understanding the competition posed by the current treatment plans and the expected growth rate over the coming few years. The study provides a detailed market forecast and opportunity analysis for the short-mid term (2016-2021) and long term (2021-2026). The research, analysis and insights presented in this report include potential sales of the approved drugs and the ones in late stages of development (phase III). To add robustness to our model, we have provided three scenarios for our market forecast; these include the conservative, base and optimistic scenarios.

/PRNewswire/ -- INTRODUCTION Developed through introduction of modifications in monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), antibody based therapeutics are gaining increased attention from both large and small pharmaceutical companies. The Y-arm of the antibody is known as Fab, comprising a constant and a variable domain from each light and heavy chain. The variable domain (Fv) within the Fab region is responsible for target specificity and binding affinity whereas the base of the antibody, known as the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region, is responsible for interaction with immune cells. Modifications made in the Fc region can alter its effector functions. The key changes made in the Fc domain to improve the effector functions include glycoengineering, protein engineering or isotype chimerism. This can result in improvement in the ADCC activity, CDC activity, ADCP activity and half-life of the molecule. The concept of engineered antibodies is widely being used for development for biobetters/biosimilars, addressing the drawbacks of their ancestor drug candidates. Several players have developed and made available their proprietary technologies for production of such engineered antibodies. This has encouraged and opened an opportunity for a large amount of licensing activity in this domain, building a strong collaborative network of small and big pharmaceutical companies. Currently, two drugs, namely Gazyva® and POTELIGEO®, are commercially available. A number of molecules are being tested primarily for oncological indications; in addition, a limited set of molecules are also being developed for non-oncological indications such as asthma, COPD, neuromyelitis optica, ulcerative colitis and hemolytic disease in the newborn. Such initiatives suggest that the overall market is likely to hold a strong potential in the coming years. SCOPE OF THE REPORT The "Fc Protein and Glycoengineered Antibodies Market (2nd Edition), 2016-2026" report was commissioned to examine the various aspects of engineering an antibody to develop novel drugs for addressing several oncology and non-oncological disorders. This market has steadily evolved over the last few years. The report examines several elements of developing these next generation antibodies, such as the technologies used for their production, site of engineering in an antibody and a robust landscape in the form of clinical / preclinical pipeline. For the purposes of this report, engineered antibodies are defined as antibodies that have been modified in their Fc region. The two types of modification considered include: - Fc Glycoengineering (referred to as 'Glycoengineering' in the report) - Fc Protein engineering As pharmaceutical companies continue to initiate and expand their research programs in this area, one of the key objectives outlined for this report was to understand the future potential of the market. This was done by analyzing: - The Fc protein and glycoengineered antibody pipeline in terms of phase of development, type of therapy (monotherapy or combination therapy) and target indications. - Technologies established by various players for development of engineered antibody therapeutics including the key mechanism involved, licencing activity, advantages and the molecules being developed using the technology. - Partnerships that have taken place in the recent past covering technology licensing, product development and commercialization agreements, clinical trial collaborations, product license agreements, acquisitions and other relevant agreements. - Inherent threats to growth in the short and long term. - The likely adoption of the Fc protein and glycoengineered antibodies by understanding the competition posed by the current treatment plans and the expected growth rate over the coming few years. The study provides a detailed market forecast and opportunity analysis for the short-mid term (2016-2021) and long term (2021-2026). The research, analysis and insights presented in this report include potential sales of the approved drugs and the ones in late stages of development (phase III).
