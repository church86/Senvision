Here's a recap. LabCorp earnings lower than expected ​Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings reported third-quarter net earnings Wednesday that missed Wall Street expectations. Net earnings in the quarter were $179.5 million, compared to $154.7 million in the third quarter of 2015. Diluted earnings per shares were $1.71 in the period, an increase of 14 percent. Adjusted earnings per shares stood at $2.25, up 9 percent over last year. Analysts expected earnings to amount to $2.29 per share. Its stock fell by more than 6 percent in Wednesday morning trading. It was trading at $129.70, down $8.71. The laboratory network reported net revenue of $2.37 billion, up 4.5 percent compared with the same period last year. The company attributed the rise to the acquisitions and organic growth. “We remain confident in our outlook for the balance of the year and our positioning for long-term profitable growth, as we deliver proprietary solutions that address our customers’ greatest needs, and improve the health and lives of patients around the globe,” said David King, chairman and chief executive officer, in a statement. Headquartered in Burlington, LabCorp more than 48,000 people. Merck profits jump 20 percent Higher sales of vaccines and prescription medicines, coupled with restrained spending, helped Merck & Co. post a 20 percent jump in third-quarter profit, trouncing Wall Street expectations. The maker of Januvia diabetes pills raised and narrowed its 2016 financial forecasts, but noted some headwinds, including the start of U.S. generic competition to three drugs by year's end. Its shares edged higher in midday trading Tuesday. The second-biggest U.S. drugmaker is in transition, with revenue from older products such as immune disorder treatment Remicade and the Dulera asthma inhaler leveling off or falling amid increased competition. But sales are building for drugs launched since 2014, particularly immuno-oncology drug Keytruda and hepatitis C-curing Zepatier. Meanwhile, Zinplava for preventing recurrence of life-threatening C. difficile infections was approved Friday in the U.S., and Merck plans to apply soon for approval of experimental diabetes drug ertugliflozin and additional uses for Keytruda, its newest blockbuster, with more than $1 billion in sales over the past four quarters. In addition, chief executive Ken Frazier told analysts during a conference call that deals to boost Merck's pipeline of experimental drugs, with a focus on small -to-midsized assets that fit well within its business, are a priority. He noted Merck is calling attention to the innovation of its medicines amid the U.S. political furor over soaring drug prices. Novartis net profit drops Swiss drug company Novartis saw net profit slip in the third quarter as the loss of a key drug to generic use in the United States outweighed strong sales of its psoriasis drug Cosentyx and MS treatment Gilenya. Core net income fell 2 percent to $2.94 billion from $2.99 billion in the previous-year quarter. The loss of Gleevec, used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia, to generic use hurt sales revenue. Gilenya, a medicine for relapsing multiple sclerosis, brought in $790 million, an increase of 15 percent. The company said that Cosentyx, with $301 million in sales, was "on track for blockbuster status" in its first full year after approval.

Ho/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images WELCH, W. Va. — The warning signs of what would become a deadly opioid epidemic emerged in early 2001. That’s when officials of the state employee health plan in West Virginia noticed a surge in deaths attributed to oxycodone, the active ingredient in the painkiller OxyContin. They quickly decided to do something about it: OxyContin prescriptions would require prior authorization. It was a way to ensure that only people who genuinely needed the painkiller could get it and that people abusing opioids could not. But an investigation by STAT has found that Purdue Pharma, the manufacturer of OxyContin, thwarted the state’s plan by paying a middleman, known as a pharmacy benefits manager, to prevent insurers from limiting prescriptions of  the drug. The financial quid pro quo between the painkiller maker and the pharmacy benefits manager, Merck Medco, came to light in West Virginia court records unsealed by a state judge at the request of STAT, and in interviews with people familiar with the arrangement. “We were screaming at the wall,” said Tom Susman, who headed the state’s public employee insurance agency in the early 2000s and led the push to limit OxyContin prescribing in West Virginia. “We saw it coming,” he said of the opioid epidemic, which today causes 28,000 overdose deaths a year in the United States. “Now to see the aftermath is the most frustrating thing I have ever seen.” Overprescribing of OxyContin and other opioid painkillers is blamed for helping to plant the seeds for the current opioid crisis. West Virginia has been hit harder than any other state: It suffers the highest per capita drug overdose death rate in the country – more than double the national average. It also has one of the highest rates of painkiller prescribing. In McDowell County, where the court records from a state lawsuit against Purdue were unsealed, the local sheriff said prescription pill abuse is so rampant that the county plans to file a new lawsuit against painkiller makers. The strategy to pay Merck Medco extended to other big pharmacy benefit managers and to many other states, according to a former Purdue official responsible for ensuring favorable treatment for OxyContin. The payments were in the form of “rebates” paid by Purdue to the companies. In return, the pharmacy benefit managers agreed to make the drug available without prior authorization and with low copayments. “That was a national contract,” Bernadette Katsur, the former Purdue official, who negotiated contracts with pharmacy benefit managers, said in an interview. “We would negotiate a certain rebate percentage for keeping it on a certain tier related to copay or whether it has prior authorization. We like to keep prior authorization off of any drug.” Katsur said prior authorization programs do little to eliminate inappropriate prescribing by “bad doctors” and usually just create needless paperwork for doctors working in the best interest of patients. She said some doctors simply won’t deal with the hassle of a prior authorization program, resulting in some legitimate patients not getting the medication they need. “You don’t want to make it harder for a doctor to prescribe when they are doing the right thing,” she said. Read more:Secret trove reveals bold ‘crusade’ to make OxyContin a blockbuster But the arrangement between the painkiller maker and companies hired by insurance plans to manage prescription drug benefits removed a key safeguard in the system that may have slowed the growth of OxyContin as it became a national bestseller that eventually peaked at annual sales of $3 billion. The former Merck Medco was purchased by Express Scripts in 2012. A spokesman for Express Scripts said no one currently at the company had knowledge of the West Virginia contract. A spokesman for Purdue Pharma said the company had no comment. Prior authorization programs typically require doctors to get approval from an insurer before they can prescribe the drug to a patient. As part of such programs, insurers will often limit the conditions for which a drug can be used and the length of time the drug can be prescribed. A study published this month by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention detailed how a private insurer’s prior authorization plan in Massachusetts reduced the prescribing of opioids by 15 percent. The West Virginia court records reveal an agonizing situation in which several West Virginia health and insurance officials were early to spot the growing threat of OxyContin addiction and moved to blunt its impact. The well-intentioned bureaucrats, however, were no match for Purdue Pharma or its paid allies. In early 2001, the pharmacy director for the state employee health plan said her office noticed coroners listing oxycodone as the cause of death for some plan members. This occurred as the number of OxyContin prescriptions written for plan members skyrocketed; spending on the drug went from $11,000 in 1996, the first full year it was on the market, to $2 million in 2002. Purdue, aided at the time by its marketing partner Abbott Laboratories, aggressively marketed OxyContin to doctors with the claim, later shown to be false, that the risk of addiction was low. STAT reported last month that the unsealed West Virginia court records showed that an Abbott sales rep won over an orthopedic surgeon with a box of doughnuts and snack cakes arranged to spell OxyContin. “We felt a need to put some type of management on the prescription because we saw death claim certificates come in with the cause of death of oxycodone,” said plan Pharmacy Director Felice Joseph in a 2004 deposition that was among the unsealed court records. The employee health plan contracted with Merck Medco to manage its pharmacy benefits, and when state officials asked Merck to put in place a plan to limit OxyContin prescribing, “basically they were refused,” she testified. The Medical Director for the state plan, Dr. Sandra Joseph, told a similar story in her deposition. “They felt strongly, and they were very, very reluctant or resistant, for whatever reason,” she said of Merck. “They did not want to put any limits or prior authorization criteria on that.” Merck downplayed concern about OxyContin abuse, Joseph testified, saying the company “referred to other areas where there were not that many prescriptions for OxyContin, it was not that much of a problem.” The pharmacy director testified that the state initially wanted to limit OxyContin to terminally ill cancer patients only. “It was because we felt there was a high abuse potential for its inappropriate use for short-term use,” she testified. She said a Merck official calculated that the company would lose $128,000 in rebate payments if OxyContin prescribing was limited in West Virginia. It was not specified if that was an annual or one-time loss. The extent of Purdue’s rebate arrangements with Merck and other benefit managers in other states is not detailed in the West Virginia court records. Read more:26 overdoses in just hours: Inside a community on the front lines of the opioid epidemic Katsur, who left Purdue in 2005, said the payment of rebates was part of a strategy to keep insurers from limiting OxyContin prescriptions. She said such arrangements were common in the industry and not unique to Purdue. In addition to keeping OxyContin from being subject to prior authorization, the rebates paid to pharmacy benefit managers were used to guarantee favorable status for OxyContin on their listings of approved drugs, she said. PBMs commonly place drugs in different tiers on these lists, called formularies. Some tiers are more restrictive and require higher copayments. Purdue wanted OxyContin placed in the least restrictive tier — and succeeded. The relationship with Merck Medco was so important that Purdue moved Katsur to New Jersey so she could be close to Merck’s national headquarters, she said. The court documents make clear that blocking any limits on OxyContin prescribing was a top priority for Purdue. In a memo listing the 2001 goals of Purdue’s West Virginia sales team, the first listed item under Medicaid is “Stop any preauthorization efforts for OxyContin.” In a separate memo, Purdue officials reported meeting with a state official to “interrupt” any efforts to require prior authorization of OxyContin. And in a presentation prepared for a 2001 West Virginia district sales meeting, a Purdue official wrote in regard to the state employee insurance plan that the company was “working with Medco (PBM) to try to make parameters less stringent.” Read more:Dope Sick: A harrowing story of best friends, addiction — and a stealth killer The internal memos and the actions of Merck contradicted claims by Purdue at the time that it was working with the state to curb abuse of OxyContin, lawyers for the state argued in a motion that was unsealed by the West Virginia court. “Contrary to the picture of helpfulness and cooperation Purdue attempts to paint, Purdue’s employees were actively and secretly trying to prevent West Virginia from imposing any control on the sale of OxyContin,” the state claimed. The case with Purdue was settled in 2004 when the company paid $10 million to West Virginia. Portions of the case file, including documents about marketing of the drug and Purdue’s attempts to ward off limits on prescribing, remained sealed until STAT filed a motion in May to open the records. Nearly two years after the state insurance plan asked Merck to put a prior authorization plan in place for OxyContin, it finally got what it wanted. But the agency succeeded only after it brought in a new company to manage its prescription plan. By then, OxyContin and other painkillers had gained a firm grip on West Virginia, especially in McDowell County, where the state brought its lawsuit against Purdue. In 2001, the county was a proverbial canary in a coal mine when it came to the emerging national opioid crisis. The rate of accidental prescription drug overdose deaths in West Virginia was relatively low at the time — about 6 deaths per 100,000 residents. In McDowell, however, the rate was 38 deaths per 100,000. Since 2001, the death rate in the state has more than tripled to 21 deaths per 100,000 in 2012. McDowell Sheriff Martin West said lawyers contracted by the county are preparing a new lawsuit against pain-pill makers. He said the county is considered a “third-world country” by state officials doling out funds to fight opioid abuse. “Listen to the scanner here every night,” he said. “It’s first responders out every night going up and down hollers for an overdose. It’s pitiful what is going on.” Go to MSN Home More in Medical Researchers Studying Role of Gender in Autism Associated Press More Physical Activity Can Lower Type 2 Diabetes Risk By 26 Percent Medical Daily 30% of Cancer Deaths Are Due to Smoking Time Should you let your dog lick your face?

Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) Oct 26, 2016 at 8:03AM Image source: Getty Images. Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) disappointed investors in the first quarter of 2016. The biotech disappointed again in the second quarter. A pattern seems to be emerging here. When Gilead announces its third-quarter results on Nov. 1, will the disappointments continue or is a positive surprise in store? It depends heavily on the answers to these three questions. 1. How much did Harvoni sales slow down? After storming out of the gate following its commercial launch in late 2014, blockbuster hepatitis C drug Harvoni has lost a good bit of steam. In the second quarter, sales for Harvoni declined nearly 29% year over year. No one is expecting Harvoni sales to rebound in the third quarter, but the market is anxious to find out how steep the decline might be. There are three main reasons behind the waning sales for the hep C drug. Competition is probably the most important. AbbVie's (NYSE:ABBV) Viekira and Merck's (NYSE:MRK) Zepatier go head-to-head with Harvoni. Gilead seems to have fended off AbbVie pretty well, although Viekira is claiming its fair share of the market. Merck, however, changed the game by launching Zepatier at a significantly lower price. Merck's move helped bring about the second main reason Harvoni's sales are slowing down. Payers are demanding -- and getting -- rebates and steep price discounts. Gilead reported much-lower average selling prices in the second quarter due to these concessions. The other factor behind Harvoni's sales decline relates to the hepatitis C patient population. When Harvoni was first launched, physicians prescribed the drug for a huge wave of patients with the most serious cases of hep C. Because Harvoni is so effective, many of those patients are now cured of the disease. Newer patients taking the drug tend to have less severe cases of hep C and can get by with shorter treatment periods. That reduces the sales volume for Harvoni. None of these things changed in the third quarter. We'll find out soon if the worst of the impact is over.  2. Did new drugs outperform expectations? Gilead rolled out a crop of impressive new drugs over the past year. Genvoya was launched in November 2015. The TAF-based HIV drug saw sales of $360 million in the first half of 2016. A couple of other TAF-based HIV drugs are also coming on strong. Descovy was launched in April 2016. Odefsey was launched in the U.S. a month earlier but didn't win European approval until June.  Possibly the biggest potential winner of the group, though, is Epclusa. The hepatitis C drug, which is the first to treat all genotypes of hep C, gained FDA approval in late June. With only three days of sales in the second quarter, Epclusa generated revenue of $64 million. The addition of Epclusa to its lineup should help Gilead battle more effectively against AbbVie and Merck. Gilead should see great numbers in the third quarter from all four of these newer drugs. If those numbers are even better than great, combined with Harvoni's sales coming in higher than expected, Gilead could have a nice quarter. 3. Will any hints be given about potential deals? At the end of the second quarter, Gilead sat on a cash stockpile totaling $24.6 billion (including cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities). Inquiring minds want to know what the biotech will do with that money. Some of it will go to share buybacks. However, Gilead CFO Robin Washington noted in her second-quarter earnings call comments that the company would probably slow down repurchases in the second half of the year. Some will also go to pay out dividends, but Gilead spent only $1.2 billion on dividends in the first six months of the year. The only acquisition Gilead has made so far in 2016 is the purchase of Nimbus Apollo, in May. Gilead spent $400 million up front in the buyout. That amounts to pocket change for the biotech. Gilead has a lot of cash that it could use to forge a deal to bolster its pipeline. Any news (actually, any hint) that it is looking to make a smart strategic acquisition should be good for the stock. Keith Speights owns shares of Gilead Sciences.

You worked with Procter & Gamble for 17 years before joining Merck in 2013. Why the transition? I never worked in healthcare before I joined Merck. It is very important to be able to relate to the category and its purpose. The contribution [Merck] gives to real people in their day-to-day lives showed me a different perspective than working on something like hair color.  How has marketing and communications changed since you joined? The first year, I wanted to see what moves consumers, doctors, and pharmacists by intentionally and significantly emotionalizing our communications. We wanted to visually soften our comms but also use terminology and ideas that speak to the heart versus speaking to the left brain, which is masculine, binary, and black and white. Around 2014, we decided to use every opportunity to position our brands as sympathy holders — the ones who care, listen, understand, and hold hands with consumers. We called them "Love Brands." At Cannes this year, Merck launched the WE100 platform. What inspired it? Love Brands was WE100's precursor. We want to prepare society for a new era where people live 100 years. Life expectancy has picked up significantly since the 1960s, even in the least developed country. But the legislative environment, government, system that is overlooking people has barely changed. You go from school to a job, the rest is smooth sailing and counting our days to the grave once you retire. What shaped the strategy? We placed a big study to find out the pain point and needs of people in this context. That shapes the content we are chewing on and about to roll out in Europe and Africa. WE100 is about the right of everybody to look forward to 100 great years and ask their governments for all the support they need. At Cannes, I was trying to find partners in crime that without any financial expectations, out of the goodness of their hearts, will help us out — such as the media industry, pharmaceutical industry, and even royalty such as [Queen Elizabeth II] and the Pope. His endorsement could be a great help for families to take this seriously for their kids. What initiatives do you have coming up around that? Healthy Hour is about raising awareness and teaching kids how to prepare for a 100-year life versus just learning about the next 20 years and how you can be good in math, physics, biology, and maybe literature so you can nail the best college and job. We are kicking that off in Africa this fall with support and engagement from governments over there. We are relying on pharmacists and doctors who in smaller villages may be the teachers of the courses. Another big project is We4You, which asks Merck employees to take time off in an organized way to help the elderly and better integrate them into society. We are doing this in Europe, working with the elderly on topics such as digital crash courses, knowledge about your bones, avoiding accidents, and restarting your professional life. What areas are you focused on? Women's and babies' health. Femibion is a pregnancy multivitamin. To support it, we came out with a campaign called Working Mothers, which is about recognizing the dedication of new moms to their babies that is perceived as holding back your career, turning it around, and recognizing your experience as a mom is a great qualification for a job as well. What can moms bring to the table? Skills moms have include listening, operational discipline, prioritizing, and multitasking, which are needed in the real world [for jobs ranging from] receptionist to the top manager. We have many female leaders. Our CEO, Uta Kemmerich-Keil, is a mother of two. The company has enabled her to go through her maternity leave, recognized her, and rewarded her to move forward. We have a lot of great stories from within our company that we will provocatively share with broader audiences in 2017. This is based in Germany and Austria, but we feel it is going to be universal. What came out of the first Global Consumer Health Debate you threw earlier this year?  The biggest realization is that 70% or more of big decisions are made by women. We had better understand their hopes, wishes, needs and contributions to the health industry. In terms of consumer health, they are the gatekeeper for the entire family. What's your biggest challenge from a marketing perspective? If doctors, pharmacists are not falling in love with what you say, they don't care or remember about the info you provide them. If your nose is decongested in 15 seconds or 12, who cares? It is a beautiful, wonderful story that can be passed onto the next person. It is worth tweeting about, and sharing on YouTube with your friends. That is what matters for doctors, pharmacists, and nurses. The challenge for the healthcare industry is how we digitize our interaction with doctors, healthcare professionals, and consumers. What agencies do you work with?  We work with Saatchi & Saatchi, SelectNY, and Ogilvy. From a PR perspective, Weber Shandwick helps us.

Meet the Contributors → FDA: Keytruda Now OK For Some Patients With Untreated Lung Cancer Alex Lash October 25th, 2016 @alexlash @xconomy Like Us Xconomy National —  The FDA has approved the use of pembrolizumab (Keytruda) for some previously untreated patients with a certain type of lung cancer, the drug’s owner Merck (NYSE: MRK) announced late Monday. Pembrolizumab can now be used for patients who have never received treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has spread to other parts of the body. To be eligible for the drug, patients must take a test that shows their tumors produce a high amount of the protein PD-L1, which pembrolizumab has been designed to recognize. Roughly a quarter of all advanced NSCLC patients have cancer with high PD-L1 levels, according to earlier studies from Merck. That restriction is important. The new wave of cancer immunotherapies called checkpoint inhibitors, which include pembrolizumab, work well for a minority of patients, but doctors and researchers are only beginning to understand the signs that might point to a benefit for some patients but not others. Those efforts will need to improve if the promise of precision cancer medicine—giving the right medicine to the right patients—is to bear fruit. (Another kind of cancer immunotherapy uses live, modified T cells but has yet to be approved. Xconomy has compiled a resource of T cell clinical studies here; a second part of the resource, compiling trials of checkpoint inhibitors, is coming soon.) Pembrolizumab becomes the first checkpoint inhibitor to be approved for first-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Last year, the FDA approved the drug and another checkpoint inhibitor, Bristol Myers Squibb’s nivolumab (Opdivo), for second-line patients whose tumors have resisted treatment with either chemotherapy or a drug that targets specific genetic mutations. The first-line approval for pembrolizumab comes weeks after Merck and its academic collaborators touted positive data from a 305-patient study, KEYNOTE-024. Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) have been studying their flagship drugs in several cancer types. But nivolumab produced negative first-line NSCLC results in August when it failed to show it could do a better job than chemotherapy in progression-free survival—that is, shrinking tumors or keeping them in check. That news set the stage for pembrolizumab’s positive data. For patients taking the drug in KEYNOTE-024, they showed progression-free survival for a median of 10.3 months, compared to 6.0 months for patients on chemotherapy. Forty five percent of the pembrolizumab patients had either partial or total shrinkage of their tumors, compared to 28 percent of the chemotherapy patients. The FDA also updated the guidelines for the use of pembrolizumab in second-line NSCLC. According to Merck, patients who have failed to improve with chemotherapy are now eligible for pembrolizumab even if their tumors produce a low level of PD-L1.

Inc. vs. AbbVie Inc. How do Merck and AbbVie compare on product lineups, pipelines, and dividends? Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) Oct 25, 2016 at 5:43PM Image source: Getty Images. Merck (NYSE:MRK) and AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) compete head-to-head in at least two prominent markets: hepatitis C and autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. AbbVie is still winning in the former category for now and dominates in the latter. But which of these two stocks has the upper hand over the long run? Here's how Merck and AbbVie stack up against each other. Why buy Merck? In the first half of this year, Merck grew earnings by an impressive 42% compared to the prior-year period. The drugmaker's stock is up 16% year to date, reflecting the strong earnings performance. That's not a compelling reason to buy Merck shares now, though.  Merck faces some challenges with its current product lineup. Sales for top-selling diabetes drug Januvia/Janumet are growing, but only a little. Cardiovascular drug Zetia is performing better. Sales for cancer drug Keytruda and hepatitis C drug Zepatier are soaring. However, the overall growth from these products isn't enough to offset declining sales for other drugs like anti-inflammatory drug Remicade and respiratory drug Nasonex. So why buy Merck? Its pipeline shows considerable promise. Keytruda was recently approved by European regulators as a second-line treatment for non-small cell lung cancer. That's another step toward reaching the $8 billion peak annual sales expected for the drug. Keytruda is also in phase 3 studies for treatment of bladder cancer, breast cancer, and multiple myeloma and in phase 2 studies targeting ovarian cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, and other advanced solid tumors.  In total, Merck's pipeline includes 21 phase 3 programs and 15 programs in phase 2. While Keytruda stands out as the candidate with the best prospects, Alzheimer's disease drug verubecestat could also be a huge winner if testing goes well. The drug is currently in a phase 3 clinical study. Investors should also like Merck's dividend. The dividend yield currently stands at 2.96%, and Merck has a good track record of paying (and often increasing) dividends. Why buy AbbVie? AbbVie hasn't been a slouch at growing earnings, either. The biotech posted year-over-year earnings growth of 24% in the first half of 2016. Unlike Merck, however, AbbVie also grew revenue by an impressive rate. Leading the way, as usual, was Humira. Sales for the autoimmune disease drug in the first six months of 2016 topped $7.2 billion, up 16% from the prior-year period. AbbVie's most sizzling growth, though, came from Imbruvica. Sales for the cancer drug in the first half of this year were over six times greater than in the same period in 2015. Hepatitis C drug Viekira is also doing quite well, with sales jumping 35% year over year to $833 million in the first six months of 2016. Another newer drug should soon make a significant revenue impact for AbbVie. Empliciti, which won European approval for multiple myeloma in May as a combination therapy with Celgene's Revlimid, could reach peak annual sales of over $4 billion.  AbbVie's pipeline also looks solid. The company has 15 phase 3 programs and 24 phase 2 programs. Standouts in AbbVie's pipeline include cancer drug veliparib and elagolix, which targets treatment of endometriosis and uterine fibroids. If you liked Merck's dividend, then you'll love AbbVie's. The dividend yield is currently 3.79%. Since the company was formed in 2013, AbbVie has increased its dividend by more than 42%. Better buy Merck certainly has several things for investors to like, but I think the better buy between these two stocks is AbbVie. The company's current product lineup continues to show strong momentum. AbbVie's pipeline holds plenty of potential. And that dividend looks really attractive. There is one big cloud on AbbVie's horizon: Sooner or later, Humira will face competition from biosimilars. However, I don't think that will happen for several more years, thanks to AbbVie's secondary patents on the drug. For now, AbbVie appears to be a good pick for investors looking for growth and income. Keith Speights owns shares of Celgene. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Celgene.

The maker of Januvia diabetes pills raised and narrowed its 2016 financial forecasts, but noted some headwinds, including the start of U.S. generic competition to three drugs by year's end. The second-biggest U.S. drugmaker is in transition, with revenue from older products such as immune disorder treatment Remicade and the Dulera asthma inhaler leveling off or falling amid increased competition. But sales are building for drugs launched since 2014, particularly immuno-oncology drug Keytruda and hepatitis C-curing Zepatier. Meanwhile, Zinplava for preventing recurrence of life-threatening C. difficile infections was approved Friday in the U.S., and Merck plans to apply soon for approval of experimental diabetes drug ertugliflozin and additional uses for Keytruda, its newest blockbuster, with more than $1 billion in sales over the past four quarters. In addition, chief executive Ken Frazier told analysts during a conference call that deals to boost Merck's pipeline of experimental drugs, with a focus on small -to-midsized assets that fit well within its business, are a priority. He noted Merck is calling attention to the innovation of its medicines amid the U.S. political furor over soaring drug prices. "We don't think these environmental pricing pressures will ease," Frazier said. Merck reported net income of $2.18 billion, or 78 cents per share. Adjusted for one-time gains and costs, earnings came to $1.07 per share, eclipsing the 98 cents analysts expected. The Kenilworth, New Jersey-based drugmaker reported revenue of $10.54 billion, up 5% and above Street forecasts for $10.24 billion. Sales of prescription drugs rose 6% to $9.44 billion, led by higher sales for Keytruda, cholesterol pill Zetia, drugs used in hospitals and Gardasil and other vaccines. Top seller Januvia and combination drug Jamumet, for Type 2 diabetes, saw sales dip 1% to a combined $1.56 billion. Sales of cholesterol medicines Zetia and Vytorin, which should face generic competition by year's end, edged up 1% to $944 million. Antibiotic Cubicin also is getting generic competition this quarter. Gardasil, a vaccine against cancer-causing human papilloma virus, saw sales jump 38% to $860 million, boosted by a higher U.S. price for a new version that protects against more strains of HPV, higher U.S. demand and purchases by government health programs. Children's vaccine Proquad also benefited from U.S. health program stockpiling, raising sales 28% to $496 million. Keytruda, one of the hot new cancer drugs that work by boosting the immune system to fight tumors, posted sales of $364 million, up 124%. Late Monday, the immuno-oncology drug won U.S. approval — two months ahead of schedule — for using Keytruda in bigger patient groups, including those newly diagnosed with lung cancer. Cancer drugs typically are approved initially for use after multiple other drugs have failed patients, then gradually allowed to be used earlier in treatment. Keytruda is already approved as a second-line treatment for lung cancer and for melanoma and head and neck cancer. It's being tested in about 300 patient studies, alone and combined with chemotherapy or other immuno-oncology drugs. "We are excited by the long-term potential of Keytruda against many different tumor types," pharmaceutical marketing head Adam Schechter told the analysts. Sanford Bernstein analyst Dr. Timothy Anderson wrote to investors that the early approval "helps cement the product's lead versus competitors in the large lung cancer market," which should further raise Keytruda sales. Sales of veterinary medicines rose 5% to $865 million, driven partly by the Bravecto line of flea and tick products. Merck now expects full-year earnings of $2.02 to $2.09, up from its July forecast of $1.98 to $2.08, and revenue of $39.7 billion to $40.2 billion, up from $39.1 billion to $40.1 billion. In midday trading, Merck shares rose 74 cents, or 1.2%, to $61.49 as the broader markets declined. Merck shares have risen more than 16% over the past year.

Merck wins early U.S. approval for Keytruda in untreated lung cancer Merck & Co has won U.S. approval to market its immunotherapy Keytruda for use in previously untreated lung cancer patients two months ahead of schedule, making it the only such drug cleared for first-line treatment. The green light from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), announced by the U.S. drugmaker late on Monday, confirms Merck's leading position in the hot area of medicines that fight tumors by harnessing the body's immune system. Breastfeeding support helps new moms stick with it, U.S. doctors say Women who want to breastfeed their babies may be more likely to try it and to stick with it when they receive education and support, new U.S. guidelines conclude. Updated recommendations issued today by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recognize the many health benefits of breastfeeding for both mothers and babies while also accepting that women need to make a personal choice about how to feed their infants, said task force member Ann Kurth, dean of the Yale School of Nursing in Orange, Connecticut. Texas hospital reaches settlement with nurse infected with Ebola A nurse who contracted the Ebola virus while treating the first person diagnosed with the deadly disease in the United States has reached a settlement with the Dallas hospital where she was in a team caring for the man, a statement on Monday said. Terms of the deal between the hospital's owner, Texas Health Resources, and nurse Nina Pham, the first person infected with Ebola in the United States, were not disclosed. Exclusive: WHO cancer agency asked experts to withhold weedkiller documents The World Health Organization's cancer agency - which is facing criticism over how it classifies carcinogens - advised academic experts on one of its review panels not to disclose documents they were asked to release under United States freedom of information laws. In a letter and an email seen by Reuters, officials from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) cautioned scientists who worked on a review in 2015 of the weedkiller glyphosate against releasing requested material. E-cigarettes could be used to help combat obesity in smokers trying to quit: study Researchers in Britain and New Zealand have found a potential new use for electronic cigarettes in smokers who want to give up - controlling appetite and limiting the weight gain that often comes with quitting. In a review published in the journal Nicotine & Tobacco Research, the scientists found that it's the nicotine in cigarettes that makes smokers less likely to overeat, and suggested e-cigarettes, which contain nicotine but no tobacco, may help prevent them from eating too much when they quit. U.N. legal stance on Haiti cholera likely pushed by U.S.: expert The United Nations likely refused to accept legal responsibility for a cholera outbreak in Haiti that has killed thousands in the past six years because it was a position pressed by the United States, an independent U.N. investigator said on Tuesday. Haiti was free of cholera until 2010, when U.N. peacekeepers dumped infected sewage into a river. Since then, more than 9,000 people have died of the disease, which causes uncontrollable diarrhea, and more than 800,000 people have fallen ill. Hired experts back claims St. Jude heart devices can be hacked Short-selling firm Muddy Waters said in a legal filing on Monday that outside experts it hired validated its claims that St. Jude Medical Inc cardiac implants are vulnerable to potentially life-threatening cyber attacks. U.S. regulators responded by reiterating previous advice that patients should keep using the devices, and a St. Jude spokeswoman said the company would respond "through appropriate legal channels." Bill Gates foundation gives $210 million to Seattle-based university Microsoft founder Bill Gates through his foundation has donated $210 million to an initiative based at the University of Washington in Seattle aimed at improving people's health around the world, university officials said on Tuesday. The gift from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, named after the billionaire and his wife, will be used to construct a building at the university to house its Population Health Initiative, the school said. Work environment may moderate menopause misery Women experiencing menopause symptoms like hot flashes and sleeping problems do better if they have a comfortable workplace and a supportive boss, according to an Australian study. By offering support to menopausal women, such as trained managers and temperature controls, workplaces can improve the employee experience and help themselves by boosting productivity, the researchers write in the journal Menopause. After concussion, kids' quality of life may dip for months Kids with persistent symptoms months after a concussion have lower quality of life than kids who have recovered, but even kids who recovered quickly may still struggle, according to a new Canadian study. "While it has been long-understood that brain injuries may negatively impact quality-of-life (especially in those patients with severe injuries who have required surgery), we were surprised to see that the quality-of-life following concussion may have prolonged effects (3 months or more) on school even in those children who had recovered within one month," said senior author Dr. Roger Zemeck of the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute in Ottawa.

Merck's optimistic comments came after it posted better-than-expected third quarter results, helped by growing sales of the cancer drug Keytruda. Keytruda on Monday became the first of the new immunotherapy drugs approved as an initial lung cancer treatment, when U.S. regulators cleared it for use in patients whose cancer cells express a high level of the PD-L1 protein that the medicine targets. The decision, which came two months earlier than expected, involves up to 30 percent of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. The Food and Drug Administration also said Keytruda could now be used in patients whose cancer progressed after chemotherapy, even with minimal PD-L1 presence, putting it on a level playing with Bristol-Myers Squibb's rival immunotherapy Opdivo in so-called second line treatment. Roche's new Tecentriq is also approved for second-line lung cancer treatment. "We believe the increasing familiarity physicians and their staff will have with using Keytruda in first-line NSCLC will help them also dominate the second line market," Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said in a research note. Bristol's perceived leadership in the hot field suffered a devastating blow in August, when its trial of Opdivo in first-line lung cancer regardless of PD-L1 levels failed to help patients more than chemotherapy. On a conference call with analysts, Merck said it was already seeing an acceleration in testing for PD-L1 following lung cancer diagnosis, which bodes well for future use of Keytruda. The drug is also approved for advanced melanoma and head and neck cancer and is being tested against numerous other cancers, with analysts forecasting eventual annual sales exceeding $8 billion. "We remain dedicated to establishing Keytruda as the leader in lung cancer," Adam Schechter, Merck's head of global pharmaceuticals, told analysts. Lung cancer is by far the largest cancer category. The company said it was seeing few limitations from health insurers over duration of treatment in lung cancer for the medicine that costs about $150,000 a year. While Merck waits for Keytruda lung cancer sales to take off, its third-quarter earnings were buoyed by strong demand for its Gardasil vaccine, Januvia diabetes drug and Keytruda in melanoma. Excluding items, Merck said it earned $1.07 per share, beating analysts' average expectations by 8 cents. The company raised the mid-point of its full-year forecast, excluding special items, and now expects to earn $3.71 to $3.78 per share, up from its prior view of $3.67 to $3.77. LILLY PROFIT DISAPPOINTS Another U.S. drugmaker, Eli Lilly and Co, is also counting on new drugs to spur future growth after reporting lower-than-expected third-quarter results that were hurt by disappointing sales of its Humalog insulin and animal health products. Excluding special items, Lilly earned 88 cents per share, 8 cents shy of analysts' average estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. But Lilly maintained its full-year forecast of $3.50 to $3.60 per share, excluding items, and said it was seeing increasing demand for it newer Trulicity and Jardiance diabetes drugs and Taltz psoriasis treatment. Lilly's fortunes, already on the rise, could take flight if its experimental Alzheimer's disease treatment solanezumab proves able to slow cognitive declines in a late stage study of patients with mild disease. Those results are expected before the end of the year. Any successful Alzheimer's treatment is expected to reap many billions of dollars in annual sales. Merck shares were up 2 percent at $61.95, while shares of Eli Lilly were up 0.5 percent at $77.99.

Merck reports financial results Tuesday, Oct. 25, 2016. (AP Photo/Mel Evans, File) Posted: Tuesday, October 25, 2016 10:38 am | Updated: 11:15 am, Tue Oct 25, 2016. Merck breezes past 3Q profit expectations, raises forecast Associated Press | Higher sales of vaccines and prescription medicines, coupled with restrained spending, helped Merck & Co. post a 20 percent jump in third-quarter profit, trouncing Wall Street expectations. The maker of Januvia diabetes pills raised and narrowed its 2016 financial forecasts, but noted some headwinds, including the start of U.S. generic competition to three drugs by year's end. Its shares edged higher in midday trading Tuesday. The second-biggest U.S. drugmaker is in transition, with revenue from older products such as immune disorder treatment Remicade and the Dulera asthma inhaler leveling off or falling amid increased competition. But sales are building for drugs launched since 2014, particularly immuno-oncology drug Keytruda and hepatitis C-curing Zepatier. Meanwhile, Zinplava for preventing recurrence of life-threatening C. difficile infections was approved Friday in the U.S., and Merck plans to apply soon for approval of experimental diabetes drug ertugliflozin and additional uses for Keytruda, its newest blockbuster, with more than $1 billion in sales over the past four quarters. In addition, chief executive Ken Frazier told analysts during a conference call that deals to boost Merck's pipeline of experimental drugs, with a focus on small -to-midsized assets that fit well within its business, are a priority. He noted Merck is calling attention to the innovation of its medicines amid the U.S. political furor over soaring drug prices. "We don't think these environmental pricing pressures will ease," Frazier said. Merck reported net income of $2.18 billion, or 78 cents per share. Adjusted for one-time gains and costs, earnings came to $1.07 per share, eclipsing the 98 cents analysts expected. The Kenilworth, New Jersey-based drugmaker reported revenue of $10.54 billion, up 5 percent and above Street forecasts for $10.24 billion. Sales of prescription drugs rose 6 percent to $9.44 billion, led by higher sales for Keytruda, cholesterol pill Zetia, drugs used in hospitals and Gardasil and other vaccines. Top seller Januvia and combination drug Jamumet, for Type 2 diabetes, saw sales dip 1 percent to a combined $1.56 billion. Sales of cholesterol medicines Zetia and Vytorin, which should face generic competition by year's end, edged up 1 percent to $944 million. Antibiotic Cubicin also is getting generic competition this quarter. Gardasil, a vaccine against cancer-causing human papilloma virus, saw sales jump 38 percent to $860 million, boosted by a higher U.S. price for a new version that protects against more strains of HPV, higher U.S. demand and purchases by government health programs. Children's vaccine Proquad also benefited from U.S. health program stockpiling, raising sales 28 percent to $496 million. Keytruda, one of the hot new cancer drugs that work by boosting the immune system to fight tumors, posted sales of $364 million, up 124 percent. Late Monday, the immuno-oncology drug won U.S. approval — two months ahead of schedule — for using Keytruda in bigger patient groups, including those newly diagnosed with lung cancer. Cancer drugs typically are approved initially for use after multiple other drugs have failed patients, then gradually allowed to be used earlier in treatment. Keytruda is already approved as a second-line treatment for lung cancer and for melanoma and head and neck cancer. It's being tested in about 300 patient studies, alone and combined with chemotherapy or other immuno-oncology drugs. "We are excited by the long-term potential of Keytruda against many different tumor types," pharmaceutical marketing head Adam Schechter told the analysts. Sanford Bernstein analyst Dr. Timothy Anderson wrote to investors that the early approval "helps cement the product's lead versus competitors in the large lung cancer market," which should further raise Keytruda sales. Sales of veterinary medicines rose 5 percent to $865 million, driven partly by the Bravecto line of flea and tick products. Merck now expects full-year earnings of $2.02 to $2.09, up from its July forecast of $1.98 to $2.08, and revenue of $39.7 billion to $40.2 billion, up from $39.1 billion to $40.1 billion. In midday trading, Merck shares rose 74 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $61.49 as the broader markets declined. Merck shares have risen more than 16 percent over the past year. _____ Follow Linda A.

You're Not Alone DJIA S&P 500 NASDAQ Markets Today After FDA Approval, Merck Posts Better-Than-Expected Earnings A day after winning approval for a cancer drug, Merck posts earnings and sales that beat consensus estimates. Alicia McElhaney Oct 25, 2016 10:19 AM EDT Merck & Co. (MRK) is having quite a good week, and it's only Tuesday. After announcing a long-expected victory for its lung cancer drug Monday night, the Kenilworth, N.J.-based pharmaceutical giant posted better-than-expected third quarter earnings. The company earned $1.07 earnings per share, beating consensus estimates of 99 cents per share by 8 cents, on a 5% increase in quarterly sales to $10.5 billion, as compared to $10.17 consensus estimates. Merck reported earnings of 96 cents per share for the same quarter in 2015. Merck updated its financial year 2016 guidance to between $3.71 and $3.78 earnings per share. It also updated revenue guidance to a range of $39.7 billion to to $40.2 billion. Analysts and investors, though, were focused on Merck's lung cancer drug, Keytruda (pembrolizumab). Late Monday the Food and Drug Administration announced approval of the drug for treatment of first-line non-small cell lung cancer. FDA approval comes two months earlier than expected.  Seamus Fernandez, an analyst at Leerink, wrote in a note that the healthcare investment firm sees Merck as a leader in the non-small cell lung cancer treatment space for at least the next year, if not longer. And the company could hold onto that title for longer if its Keytruda trials continue to succeed. The company's CEO, Ken Frazier, noted that Keytruda is in over 360 trials at present, 200 of which are in combination with another drug, which is the way most scientists are approaching cancer treatment nowadays. Perhaps, then, this is why Merck indicated interest in related M&A activity in the coming months.

X Merck beats quarterly revenue expectations Second-largest US drugmaker raises its full-year profit and revenue forecasts Tue, Oct 25, 2016, 14:29 Merck reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue due to higher sales of its vaccines and cancer drug Keytruda. Photograph: Emile Wamsteker/Bloomberg         US pharmaceutical company Merck reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue due to higher sales of its vaccines and cancer drug Keytruda, which won an early US approval on Monday for use in previously untreated lung cancer patients. Shares of Merck, which also raised its full-year profit and revenue forecasts, were up 1.23 per cent at $61.50 in premarket trading on Tuesday. The second-largest US drugmaker is betting on Keytruda to boost earnings as expectations for the drug have been building since its success in treating selected untreated patients. Perrigo to review options for multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri Irish researcher gets funding to develop innovative inhaler Northern Irish firm Almac plans €23m US facility expansion The approval from the US Food and Drug Administration confirms Merck’s leading position in the hot area of medicines that fight tumors by harnessing the body’s immune system. Annual sales of the drug are now expected to reach $8.1 billion in 2021, according to consensus forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters. Third-quarter sales of Keytruda, which is already approved to treat advanced melanoma and some forms of lung cancer, rose to $356 million from $159 million, slightly below the consensus estimate of $376 million, according to Evercore ISI. Merck said the company’s total sales increased 5 per cent to $10.54 billion, above analysts’ average estimate of $10.18 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales for its Gardasil vaccine rose 38 per cent to $860 million, well above Evercore’s consensus estimate of $635.6 million. Merck’s stock had risen 15 per cent this year, compared with a 3.5 per cent fall in the S&P 500 Healthcare index.

You're Not Alone DJIA S&P 500 NASDAQ Markets Today Merck Lifts Full-Year Guidance After Quarterly Forecast Beat The group's Keytruda immunotherapy boosts pharmaceuticals sales. Laura Board Oct 25, 2016 7:25 AM EDT Pharmaceuticals company Merck (MRK) on Tuesday nudged its full-year earnings and revenue forecasts higher as it posted third-quarter results that beat expectations. The Kenilworth, N.J. company posted a 5% increase in quarterly sales to $10.5 billion, compared with the $10.17 consensus expectation, as compiled by FactSet. Adjusted earnings per share at $1.07 came in above predictions for EPS of 99 cents and above the 96 cents Merck reported a year earlier. Quarterly results were buoyed by strong growth from its Keytruda immunotherapy within its oncology unit. That helped push pharmaceutical sales up 6%. Animal health sales rose 5%. Merck said it now expects full-year 2016 GAAP EPS to be between $2.02 and $2.09 and full-year 2016 non-GAAP EPS to be between $3.71 to $3.78. It predicts revenue will come in between $39.7 billion and $40.2 billion. On reporting second-quarter figures in August, Merck had previously lowered its full-year 2016 GAAP EPS range to be between $1.98 and $2.08, and raised the bottom end of its full-year 2016 non-GAAP EPS range to predict a range of $3.67 to $3.77. Merck shares were up 1.4% at $61.61 in premarket trading. If you liked this article you might like SBUX, GE, PFE: Jim Cramer's Views Cramer shares his views on the world of unknowns.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad Merck predicts lung cancer dominance for Keytruda immunotherapy By Reuters Published: 12:15 EST, 25 October 2016 | Updated: 12:15 EST, 25 October 2016 e-mail By Bill Berkrot and Ransdell Pierson NEW YORK, Oct 25 - Merck & Co on Tuesday declared its intention to dominate the large and lucrative lung cancer market, bolstered by a significant expansion of approved U.S. uses for its drug that helps the immune system attack tumors. Merck's optimistic comments came after it posted better-than-expected third quarter results, helped by growing sales of the cancer drug Keytruda. Keytruda on Monday became the first of the new immunotherapy drugs approved as an initial lung cancer treatment, when U.S. regulators cleared it for use in patients whose cancer cells express a high level of the PD-L1 protein that the medicine targets. The decision, which came two months earlier than expected, involves up to 30 percent of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. The Food and Drug Administration also said Keytruda could now be used in patients whose cancer progressed after chemotherapy, even with minimal PD-L1 presence, putting it on a level playing with Bristol-Myers Squibb's rival immunotherapy Opdivo in so-called second line treatment. Roche's new Tecentriq is also approved for second-line lung cancer treatment. "We believe the increasing familiarity physicians and their staff will have with using Keytruda in first-line NSCLC will help them also dominate the second line market," Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said in a research note. Bristol's perceived leadership in the hot field suffered a devastating blow in August, when its trial of Opdivo in first-line lung cancer regardless of PD-L1 levels failed to help patients more than chemotherapy. On a conference call with analysts, Merck said it was already seeing an acceleration in testing for PD-L1 following lung cancer diagnosis, which bodes well for future use of Keytruda. The drug is also approved for advanced melanoma and head and neck cancer and is being tested against numerous other cancers, with analysts forecasting eventual annual sales exceeding $8 billion. "We remain dedicated to establishing Keytruda as the leader in lung cancer," Adam Schechter, Merck's head of global pharmaceuticals, told analysts. Lung cancer is by far the largest cancer category. The company said it was seeing few limitations from health insurers over duration of treatment in lung cancer for the medicine that costs about $150,000 a year. While Merck waits for Keytruda lung cancer sales to take off, its third-quarter earnings were buoyed by strong demand for its Gardasil vaccine, Januvia diabetes drug and Keytruda in melanoma. Excluding items, Merck said it earned $1.07 per share, beating analysts' average expectations by 8 cents. The company raised the mid-point of its full-year forecast, excluding special items, and now expects to earn $3.71 to $3.78 per share, up from its prior view of $3.67 to $3.77. LILLY PROFIT DISAPPOINTS Another U.S. drugmaker, Eli Lilly and Co, is also counting on new drugs to spur future growth after reporting lower-than-expected third-quarter results that were hurt by disappointing sales of its Humalog insulin and animal health products. Excluding special items, Lilly earned 88 cents per share, 8 cents shy of analysts' average estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. But Lilly maintained its full-year forecast of $3.50 to $3.60 per share, excluding items, and said it was seeing increasing demand for it newer Trulicity and Jardiance diabetes drugs and Taltz psoriasis treatment. Lilly's fortunes, already on the rise, could take flight if its experimental Alzheimer's disease treatment solanezumab proves able to slow cognitive declines in a late stage study of patients with mild disease. Those results are expected before the end of the year. Any successful Alzheimer's treatment is expected to reap many billions of dollars in annual sales. Merck shares were up 2 percent at $61.95, while shares of Eli Lilly were up 0.5 percent at $77.99.

The maker of Januvia diabetes pills raised and narrowed its 2016 financial forecasts, but noted some headwinds, including the start of U.S. generic competition to three drugs by year's end. Its shares edged higher in midday trading Tuesday. FILE - In this Thursday, Dec. 18, 2014, file photo, a person walks through a Merck company building, in Kenilworth, N.J. Merck reports financial results Tuesday, Oct. 25, 2016. (AP Photo/Mel Evans, File) The second-biggest U.S. drugmaker is in transition, with revenue from older products such as immune disorder treatment Remicade and the Dulera asthma inhaler leveling off or falling amid increased competition. But sales are building for drugs launched since 2014, particularly immuno-oncology drug Keytruda and hepatitis C-curing Zepatier. Meanwhile, Zinplava for preventing recurrence of life-threatening C. difficile infections was approved Friday in the U.S., and Merck plans to apply soon for approval of experimental diabetes drug ertugliflozin and additional uses for Keytruda, its newest blockbuster, with more than $1 billion in sales over the past four quarters. In addition, chief executive Ken Frazier told analysts during a conference call that deals to boost Merck's pipeline of experimental drugs, with a focus on small -to-midsized assets that fit well within its business, are a priority. He noted Merck is calling attention to the innovation of its medicines amid the U.S. political furor over soaring drug prices. "We don't think these environmental pricing pressures will ease," Frazier said. Merck reported net income of $2.18 billion, or 78 cents per share. Adjusted for one-time gains and costs, earnings came to $1.07 per share, eclipsing the 98 cents analysts expected. The Kenilworth, New Jersey-based drugmaker reported revenue of $10.54 billion, up 5 percent and above Street forecasts for $10.24 billion. Sales of prescription drugs rose 6 percent to $9.44 billion, led by higher sales for Keytruda, cholesterol pill Zetia, drugs used in hospitals and Gardasil and other vaccines. Top seller Januvia and combination drug Jamumet, for Type 2 diabetes, saw sales dip 1 percent to a combined $1.56 billion. Sales of cholesterol medicines Zetia and Vytorin, which should face generic competition by year's end, edged up 1 percent to $944 million. Antibiotic Cubicin also is getting generic competition this quarter. Gardasil, a vaccine against cancer-causing human papilloma virus, saw sales jump 38 percent to $860 million, boosted by a higher U.S. price for a new version that protects against more strains of HPV, higher U.S. demand and purchases by government health programs. Children's vaccine Proquad also benefited from U.S. health program stockpiling, raising sales 28 percent to $496 million. Keytruda, one of the hot new cancer drugs that work by boosting the immune system to fight tumors, posted sales of $364 million, up 124 percent. Late Monday, the immuno-oncology drug won U.S. approval — two months ahead of schedule — for using Keytruda in bigger patient groups, including those newly diagnosed with lung cancer. Cancer drugs typically are approved initially for use after multiple other drugs have failed patients, then gradually allowed to be used earlier in treatment. Keytruda is already approved as a second-line treatment for lung cancer and for melanoma and head and neck cancer. It's being tested in about 300 patient studies, alone and combined with chemotherapy or other immuno-oncology drugs. "We are excited by the long-term potential of Keytruda against many different tumor types," pharmaceutical marketing head Adam Schechter told the analysts. Sanford Bernstein analyst Dr. Timothy Anderson wrote to investors that the early approval "helps cement the product's lead versus competitors in the large lung cancer market," which should further raise Keytruda sales. Sales of veterinary medicines rose 5 percent to $865 million, driven partly by the Bravecto line of flea and tick products. Merck now expects full-year earnings of $2.02 to $2.09, up from its July forecast of $1.98 to $2.08, and revenue of $39.7 billion to $40.2 billion, up from $39.1 billion to $40.1 billion. In midday trading, Merck shares rose 74 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $61.49 as the broader markets declined. Merck shares have risen more than 16 percent over the past year. _____ Follow Linda A.

The green light from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), announced by the U.S. drugmaker late on Monday, confirms Merck's leading position in the hot area of medicines that fight tumours by harnessing the body's immune system. Keytruda's latest approval is for treating first-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients with high-levels of a protein called PD-L1, which makes them more receptive to immunotherapy. The FDA had set a target date of Dec. 24 for deciding on this new use. Expectations for Keytruda, which works by taking the brakes off the immune system, have been building since its success in treating selected untreated patients. Annual sales of the drug are now expected to reach $8.1 billion in 2021, according to consensus forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters. Rival Bristol-Myers Squibb's drug Opdivo failed in a late-stage trial for the same indication. Bristol had tried to make Opdivo work irrespective of PD-L1 levels. In the event, it disappointed comprehensively in a major study. Keytruda and Opdivo, along with Roche's rival immunotherapy Tecentriq, are already approved for lung cancer patients who have undergone previous chemotherapy. Keytruda had originally only been cleared in this second-line setting for patients with high PD-L1 levels but the FDA also expanded this on Monday to allow for treatment where PD-L1 expression is just 1 percent or more. Immunotherapy drugs are used additionally in melanoma, Hodgkin lymphoma and cancers of the bladder, kidney, head and neck, but lung cancer, the world's biggest cancer killer with an annual death toll of 1.6 million, is the biggest potential market. Although doctors are allowed to prescribe medicines for not yet approved uses, the FDA's first-line clearance of Keytruda could greatly increase the number of patients taking the drug. Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said the news should cement Merck's position as leader in the first-line lung cancer field for at least the next 12 to 18 months, after when the battle is likely to shift to new combination therapies. Only a quarter to a third of non-small cell lung cancer patients have tumours with at least 50 percent of cells producing PD-L1, making them suitable for first-line Keytruda, so around 70 percent of the market is still up for grabs. As a result, the race is now on between Merck, Bristol, Roche and AstraZeneca to find smart ways for combining treatments, either by adding chemotherapy or using two different immunotherapies in tandem. Merck's first-line approval was based on data from a late-stage study which showed Keytruda achieved superior progression-free and overall survival compared to chemotherapy in patients whose tumours expressed high levels of PD-L1.

Net income attributable rose to $2.18 billion, or 78 cents per share, for the third quarter from $1.83 billion, or 64 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $10.54 billion from $10.07 billion. Merck is betting on Keytruda to boost earnings as demand wanes for its diabetes franchise, Januvia and a related combination medicine called Janumet, and Remicade arthritis drug. The company said on Monday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Keytruda for use in certain previously untreated lung cancer patients, making it the only approved first-line treatment.

Print Share All News Consumer Pharma New Drugs Pipeline Clinical Trials FDA Alerts FDA Approves Merck’s Keytruda (pembrolizumab) for First-Line Treatment of Certain Patients with Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Tweet KENILWORTH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE) October 24, 2016 --Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Keytruda (pembrolizumab), the company’s anti-PD-1 (programmed death receptor-1) therapy, for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression (tumor proportion score [TPS] of 50 percent or more) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. With this new indication, Keytruda is now the only anti-PD-1 therapy to be approved in the first-line treatment setting for these patients. In addition, the FDA approved a labeling update to include data from KEYNOTE-010 in the second-line or greater treatment setting for patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS of one percent or more) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving Keytruda. In metastatic NSCLC, Keytruda is approved for use at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred with Keytruda including pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, and nephritis. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, Keytruda (pembrolizumab) should be withheld or discontinued and corticosteroids administered when appropriate. Keytruda can also cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions and for Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue Keytruda. Based on its mechanism of action, Keytruda can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Female patients of reproductive potential should be advised of the potential hazard to a fetus. For more information regarding immune-mediated and infusion-related adverse reactions and use in pregnancy, see “Selected Important Safety Information” below. “Keytruda improved survival, compared to traditional chemotherapy, in patients with non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors express high levels of PD-L1,” said Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D., president, Merck Research Laboratories. “The approval of Keytruda for the first-line treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer has the potential to change the treatment landscape for these patients.” “With this new indication, Keytruda can now be a first treatment option instead of chemotherapy for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors express high levels of PD-L1,” said Roy S. Herbst, M.D., Ph.D., professor of medicine and chief of medical oncology, Yale Cancer Center and Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale New Haven. “These data reaffirm the importance of testing for PD-L1 expression in non-small cell lung cancer in order to identify those patients who are most likely to benefit from treatment with Keytruda.” Data Supporting First-Line Approval The approval was based on data from KEYNOTE-024, a randomized, open-label, phase 3 study evaluating Keytruda monotherapy compared to standard of care (SOC) platinum-containing chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with both squamous (18%) and non-squamous (82%) metastatic NSCLC. The study enrolled patients who had not received prior systemic chemotherapy treatment for their metastatic disease and whose tumors had high PD-L1 expression (TPS of 50 percent or more) and with no EGFR or ALK aberrations. The study randomized 305 patients to receive Keytruda (200 mg every three weeks) or investigator-choice SOC platinum-based chemotherapy (pemetrexed+carboplatin, pemetrexed+cisplatin, gemcitabine+cisplatin, gemcitabine+carboplatin, or paclitaxel+carboplatin). Pemetrexed maintenance therapy was permitted for patients with non-squamous histologies. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); additional efficacy outcome measures were overall survival (OS) and overall response rate (ORR). Based on an interim analysis demonstrating Keytruda (pembrolizumab) was superior compared to chemotherapy for both the primary endpoint of PFS and the secondary endpoint of OS, the trial was stopped early in June 2016 to give patients still on chemotherapy the opportunity to receive Keytruda. Findings demonstrated that Keytruda reduced the risk of progression or death by 50 percent compared to chemotherapy (HR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.37, 0.68]; p<0.001). Additionally, Keytruda resulted in a 40 percent reduction in the risk of death compared to chemotherapy (HR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.41, 0.89]; p=0.005). “The approval of Keytruda in the first-line setting adds to the momentum of progress that has been made to treat lung cancer, particularly in the area of immunotherapy,” said Laurie Fenton Ambrose, president and CEO, Lung Cancer Alliance. “Patients now have an option beyond chemotherapy at initial diagnosis. This approval reinforces the need for biomarker testing so care can be personalized and most effective.” Selected Important Safety Information for Keytruda (pembrolizumab) Keytruda can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 94 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving Keytruda, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%) pneumonitis and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (6.9%) compared to those without (2.9%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold Keytruda for Grade 2; permanently discontinue Keytruda for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis. Keytruda can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 48 (1.7%) of 2799 patients receiving Keytruda, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) colitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold Keytruda for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue Keytruda for Grade 4 colitis. See additional “Selected Important Safety Information” below. Data Supporting Second-Line Labeling Update KEYNOTE-010 is a randomized, open-label, phase 2/3 trial evaluating Keytruda (2 mg/kg [n=344] or 10 mg/kg [n=346] every three weeks) compared to SOC chemotherapy (docetaxel, 75 mg/m2 every three weeks [n=343]) in 1,033 patients with squamous (21%) and non-squamous (70%) metastatic NSCLC with all levels of PD-L1 expression (TPS of one percent or more) who had progressed following platinum-containing chemotherapy and, if appropriate, targeted therapy for EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. Additionally, results were reported in a subset of patients who had high PD-L1 expression (TPS of 50 percent or more) in the Keytruda 2 mg/kg (n=139), Keytruda 10 mg/kg (n=151), and chemotherapy cohorts (n=152). The primary endpoints were OS and PFS. Additional efficacy measures included ORR and response duration. Keytruda demonstrated superior OS versus docetaxel in patients with all levels of PD-L1 expression. Based on exploratory analyses, higher OS was associated with higher PD-L1 expression level. In KEYNOTE-010, treatment was discontinued for adverse reactions in eight percent of the 682 patients receiving Keytruda (pembrolizumab) across both doses. The most common adverse event resulting in permanent discontinuation of Keytruda was pneumonitis (1.8%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of Keytruda (pembrolizumab) occurred in 23% of patients; the most common (≥1%) were diarrhea (1%), fatigue (1.3%), pneumonia (1%), liver enzyme elevation (1.2%), decreased appetite (1.3%), and pneumonitis (1%). The most frequent adverse reactions (reported in at least 10% of Keytruda patients and occurring at the same or higher incidence than in the docetaxel arm) were decreased appetite (25% for Keytruda vs. 23% for docetaxel), dyspnea (23% vs. 20%), nausea (20% vs. 18%), cough (19% vs. 14%), rash (17% vs. 8%), constipation (15% vs. 12%), vomiting (13% vs. 10%), arthralgia (11% vs. 9%), back pain (11% vs. 8%), and pruritus (11% vs. 3%). Other clinically important adverse reactions occurring in patients receiving Keytruda were fatigue (25%), diarrhea (14%), asthenia (11%), and pyrexia (11%). PD-L1 Companion Diagnostic for Patients with Metastatic NSCLC The PD-L1 IHC 22C3 PharmDx™ kit made by Dako North America, Inc., an Agilent Technologies Company, was approved in 2015 by the FDA for use in detecting PD-L1, an immune-related biomarker expressed on some tumor cells. The diagnostic is intended to aid in identifying appropriate patients for treatment with Keytruda, including previously treated patients whose tumors have any level of PD-L1 expression (TPS of one percent or more) and previously untreated patients whose tumors have high levels of PD-L1 expression (TPS of 50 percent or more). Tumors with a TPS of less than one percent are considered to have no PD-L1 expression.

Merck anticipates making Zinplava available in first quarter 2017. Zinplava is indicated to reduce recurrence of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in patients 18 years of age or older who are receiving antibacterial drug treatment of CDI and are at high risk for CDI recurrence. Zinplava is not indicated for the treatment of CDI. Zinplava is not an antibacterial drug. Zinplava should only be used in conjunction with antibacterial drug treatment of CDI. CDI is caused by bacteria that produce toxins, including toxin B. Symptoms of CDI include mild-to-severe diarrhea, abdominal pain and fever. The incidence of recurrent CDI is higher in certain patient populations, including people 65 years of age or older and those with compromised immune systems. “For generations, Merck has been steadfast in its commitment to fighting infectious diseases – and that commitment continues today. Zinplava is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to C. difficile toxin B and neutralizes its effects,” said Dr. Nicholas Kartsonis, vice president of clinical development, infectious diseases, Merck Research Laboratories. Selected safety information about Zinplava Heart failure was reported more commonly in the two Phase 3 clinical trials in Zinplava-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. These adverse reactions occurred primarily in patients with underlying congestive heart failure (CHF). In patients with a history of CHF, 12.7% (15/118) of Zinplava-treated patients and 4.8% (5/104) of placebo-treated patients had the serious adverse reaction of heart failure during the 12-week study period. Additionally, in patients with a history of CHF, there were more deaths in Zinplava-treated patients [19.5% (23/118)] than in placebo-treated patients [12.5% (13/104)] during the 12-week study period. The causes of death varied, and included cardiac failure, infections, and respiratory failure. In patients with a history of CHF, Zinplava (bezlotoxumab) should be reserved for use when the benefit outweighs the risk. The most common adverse reactions occurring within 4 weeks of infusion with a frequency greater than placebo and reported in ≥4% of patients treated with Zinplava and Standard of Care (SoC) antibacterial drug therapy vs placebo and SoC antibacterial drug therapy included nausea (7% vs 5%), pyrexia (5% vs 3%) and headache (4% vs 3%). Serious adverse reactions occurring within 12 weeks following infusion were reported in 29% of Zinplava-treated patients and 33% of placebo-treated patients. Heart failure was reported as a serious adverse reaction in 2.3% of Zinplava-treated patients and 1.0% of placebo-treated patients. In Zinplava-treated patients, 10% experienced one or more infusion specific adverse reactions compared to 8% of placebo-treated patients, on the day of or the day after, the infusion. Infusion specific adverse reactions reported in ≥0.5% of patients receiving Zinplava and at a frequency greater than placebo were nausea (3%), fatigue (1%), pyrexia (1%), dizziness (1%), headache (2%), dyspnea (1%) and hypertension (1%). Of these patients, 78% experienced mild adverse reactions, and 20% of patients experienced moderate adverse reactions. These reactions resolved within 24 hours following onset. As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity following administration of Zinplava. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to bezlotoxumab in two Phase 3 studies with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. Following treatment with Zinplava in these two studies, none of the 710 evaluable patients tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-bezlotoxumab antibodies. About bezlotoxumab Bezlotoxumab was developed by researchers at the University of Massachusetts Medical School’s MassBiologics Laboratory in conjunction with Medarex (now part of Bristol-Myers Squibb), and was licensed to Merck in 2009.

Picture: Ian Georgeson PERRY GOURLEY Email 07:46 Tuesday 25 October 2016 0 Have your say German healthcare giant Merck has signed a licensing deal with Edinburgh University’s commercialisation arm for a pioneering technology developed by academics. The invention, which is the subject of a patent application, involves the use of a fluorescent compound that can be used to help to understand how disease progresses in early stages. A research team from the University of Edinburgh’s School of Clinical Sciences, led by principal investigator Marc Vendrell, worked in collaboration with academic partners at the University of Barcelona and the University of Manchester to co-invent the technology. The initial stages of the work were funded by the European Union Commission via a Marie Curie grant. READ MORE: Collagen Solutions secures Merck supply agreement Angus Stewart-Liddon, licensing executive of Edinburgh Research & Innovation, which signed the agreement with Merck, desrcibed it as an “exciting breakthrough”. He said: “Working with the life science business of Merck means the technology will be made readily accessible to researchers worldwide, both in industry and in academia. It is another great example of the university working in collaboration with trusted industry partners.” Udit Batra, chief executive of life science for Merck, said: “At Merck, we are always looking for innovative ideas to enhance our customers’ research efforts.” He said the compound developed will complement the company’s existing portfolio of chemical biology tools. Founded in 1668, Merck is the world’s oldest pharmaceutical and chemical company. The founding family remains the majority owner of the publicly listed group. Earlier this year, Glasgow-based life sciences firm Collagen Solutions agreed a deal to supply Merck with products developed for use in regenerative medicine, medical devices and in-vitro diagnostics.

The statement from Sanofi Pasteur MSD, the Irish subsidiary of Merek Sharp Dolhme, made the comments, after The Anglo-Celt was made aware of several incidents in the local region where families believe their daughters made have become seriously ill as a result of side-effects of the vaccine. Among the concerns highlighted are limb paralysis, early onset of MS, ovarian failure, even menopause. At the time of going to print, the HSE had still not responded with figures detailing the uptake rates of the vaccination in counties Cavan and Monaghan over since it was first introduced for young teenage girls back in 2010. But in a statement to The Anglo-Celt, Sanofi Pasteur MSD say that patient safety is the company’s “highest priority”. “We encourage people to self-report or report on behalf of others, any changes to their health which may or may not be medically confirmed. These reports are taken extremely seriously and are used to monitor long-term safety, however, they do not necessarily prove a causal relationship with the vaccine, but provide health authorities with a line of enquiry for further investigation, if required.” The Gardasil HPV vaccine is the result of over 10 years of research and development. The safety of the vaccine has continued to be evaluated in several large post-licence surveillance studies in more than one million people (Vichnin et al, 2015). HPV vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 & 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers. To date, more than 213 million doses of Gardasil have been distributed globally, and, by January 2016, in Ireland over 580,000 doses of the vaccine has been administered and over 200,000 girls have been fully vaccinated. Sanofi Pasteur MSD added: “Through constant worldwide surveillance, the safety of medicinal products, including vaccines, is routinely reviewed as part of an ongoing safety monitoring process. While no vaccine or medicine is completely without risk, leading international health organisations throughout the world continue to recommend routine HPV vaccination.” However, before the Dáil earlier this month, by way of Parliamentary Questions, Deputies Tony McLoughlin (FG), Marc MacSharry (FF), and Martin Kenny (SF) each submitted individual questions to the Minister for Health Simon Harris for response. The were joined by Independents Michael Fitzmaurice and Clare Daly. Each highlighted concerns, including if incidence of adverse reactions are under-reported as most doctors will not acknowledge any connection between a vaccine and a subsequent serious medical condition that manifests in the weeks or months afterwards.

Todd Campbell (TMFEBCapital) Oct 25, 2016 at 3:40PM Since launching in late 2014, sales of Merck & Co.'s (NYSE:MRK) Keytruda, a cancer fighting drug, are already growing quickly. However, a new FDA approval of Keytruda as a first-line therapy for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer could make Keytruda's sales pace accelerate even more in the coming year. Image source: Stockmonkeys.com via Flickr. What is Keytruda? Keytruda inhibits the activity of programmed death ligand 1, or PD-L1, a key protein that hinders a patient's T-cell's from identifying and killing cancer cells. By curbing the expression of PD-L1, Keytruda keeps cancer from being able to exploit PD-L1 to evade the immune system. That's incredibly important because studies show that high tumor expression of PD-L1 can be associated with increased tumor aggressiveness and a significant increase in risk of death. Based on Keytruda's positive efficacy in human trials, the FDA's already approved Keytruda's use in melanoma, head and neck cancer, and lung cancer patients. Up until now, Keytruda's use in lung cancer was restricted to a subset of patients whose disease remains after receiving platinum-containing chemotherapy, and whose tumors have a specific genetic make-up. However, the FDA significantly expanded that patient population on Oct. 24 when it approved Keytruda's first-line use in metastatic NSCLC patients prior to chemotherapy who express PD-1 at a rate greater than 50%. A decision on Keytruda's use in these patients hadn't been expected until Christmastime. Keytruda's market opportunity Keytruda competes head-to-head against Bristol-Myers Squibb's (NYSE:BMY) PD-1 inhibitor Opdivo, and so far Opdivo's sales have outpaced Keytruda's. While Keytruda's sales were $314 million in Q2, Opdivos's sales that quarter totaled $840 million. Opdivo's market leading position has been largely due to the fact that Keytruda requires PD-L1 testing prior to its use, while Opdivo doesn't. Opdivo's advantage, however, is disappearing. Although both Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb evaluated their drugs in the first-line NSCLC setting, only Keytruda proved that it works better in high-expressing PD-1 patients than standard chemotherapy. Keytruda's win in first-line patients should encourage doctors to switch over to it quickly, making PD-L1 testing common. If so, then the availability of PD-L1 data later in treatment could erase Opdivo's advantage in later-stage patients who haven't yet received Keytruda therapy. Since Keytruda's once every three week dosing is better than Opdivo's bi-weekly dosing, Opdivo's NSCLC revenue could shift rapidly to Merck over the next year. Following Keytruda's first-line approval, analysts are adjusting their peak sales estimates higher for Keytruda and lower for Opdivo. For instance, Bernstein analysts have bumped up their Keytruda outlook for next year by $1 billion and they now expect Keytruda sales of $7.8 billion in 2025, up from $5.35 billion previously. In Q3, Keytruda's sales clocked in at a $1.4 billion pace. Bernstein is targeting Opdivo sales of $10.3 billion in 2025, down from prior estimates of $13.3 billion. Looking ahead Up-regulation of PD-L1 allows many cancer types to evade the immune system, and both Merck and Bristol-Myers are conducting dozens of trials in hopes of expanding Keytruda and Opdivo's labels to include more patients. Many of these trials are combining Keytruda and Opdivo with other cancer fighting agents, which suggests that these drugs could become the backbone of a standard of care in cancer. Assuming trials continue to pan out, both of these drugs appear to have long-lasting, megablockbuster potential. Since Keytruda has patent protection in the U.S. until 2028, it's likely to move the needle for investors for a while.  Todd Campbell has no position in any stocks mentioned. Todd owns E.B.

Announced late Monday, the approval granted a first-line indication for patients who have tumors with a tumor progression score (TPS) ≥50%, as determined by an FDA-approved test for PD-L1 expression, and no actionable EGFR or ALK mutations. The expanded indication was based on data from the KEYNOTE-024, reported at the European Society for Medical Oncology conference, which demonstrated a survival advantage with pembrolizumab versus platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line therapy for metastatic NSCLC. The implications of the new indication go far beyond the usual expanded-indication status granted by the FDA, said Roy S. Herbst, MD, PhD, of Yale Cancer Center in New Haven, Conn. He estimated that the patient-selection criteria stipulated by the approval encompasses 20% to 30% of patients with untreated metastatic NSCLC. “This is huge, to think that we have replaced chemotherapy in first line in lung cancer with an immunotherapy for a large number of patients,” Herbst told MedPage Today. “The assay for PD-L1 expression identified patients who were more likely to respond to PD-1 inhibition, and I think it represents a new standard of care.” At the same time, the FDA updated pembrolizumab labeling related to its current indication for second-line use, defining appropriate patients as those with metastatic NSCLC associated with TPS ≥1%, disease progression during or after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, and no EGFR or ALK mutations. The labeling update reflected data from the recently reported KEYNOTE-010 randomized trial, which demonstrated improved survival with pembrolizumab versus docetaxel as second-line therapy for metastatic NSCLC. The principal investigator in KEYNOTE-010, Herbst acknowledged that PD-L1 is not a perfect biomarker. “As good as it is, it still identifies only 20% to 30% of the patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. We still have to figure out what to do for the rest of the patients,” said Herbst. “For starters, we probably have to give some thought to combination therapy for patients who test negative for PD-L1. “PD-L1 is not a perfect biomarker but it’s good enough that I would recommend that everyone get tested for PD-L1 expression,” Herbst added. “There is probably a group of patients who could benefit from PD-1 inhibition but who are not getting the therapy. Probably need to look at mutational load, gene signatures, and presence or absence of inflammation.” 2016-10-25T14:00:00-0400 0 comments Next More in Oncology/Hematology The $160 a Month Cancer Management Solution Cancer Management Without the Hospital: A Patient's Story Keeping Chemo Patients Away From Hospitals NCCN Launches Campaign on Vincristine Safety Bias in Prostate Biopsy Decision Affects Risk Factors Few Childhood Ca Survivors Ever Fully Recover Pearls from: John Byrd, MD Anal Cancer Rates Continue to Rise Next Article MedPageToday is a trusted and reliable source for clinical and policy coverage that directly affects the lives and practices of health care professionals.

Sales of Gardasil and the newer Gardasil 9 topped $860 million in the third quarter, a 38% increase from sales in the year-earlier period, according to an 8-K report filed by Merck MRK, -0.66%  on Tuesday. The sales bump wasn’t attributable to price increases on Gardasil alone, Merck said, but rather to typical price increases combined with an increasing shift by patients to the more expensive Gardasil 9, which prevents against nine types of HPV compared to Gardasil’s four and was approved in late 2014. Read: Merck profit, revenue boosted by cancer drugs Price increases were “similar to price increases we’ve had in the past, you haven’t seen any difference or acceleration, per se,” management said on the company’s conference call, according to the FactSet transcript. “Most patients are moving to the 9 valent vaccine. That’s a price increase, plus a difference in price between those two.” Gardasil sales in the third quarter grew 36% in the U.S. But Merck said that a recent pronouncement by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — that boys and girls under age 15 only need two doses of the vaccine — should negatively impact the vaccine’s sales moving forward. The effect is difficult to predict because patients pay per Gardasil dose, and could spread doses out over time, Merck said. The CDC recommends 11 to 12-year-old patients space the doses at least half a year apart. See: How a Merck cancer breakthrough caused Bristol-Myers’ stock to plunge Though there’s “certainly going to be an impact,” of the CDC’s new recommendations, the company said, “the magnitude right now, we can’t be certain of.” The company noted the new U.S. dosing has been adopted in some other markets. The new guidelines have prompted speculation of an increase in the price of a dose of Gardasil. Merck declined to comment on the question outside of the “negative impact on sales” going forward. Related: These investors, many with religious ties, are calling for drug price transparency Despite Merck’s negative portrayal of the CDC decision, it also alleviates a problem the company has long faced: that most of those getting the vaccine aren’t completing the full three doses. The issue will continue to linger for Merck, since patients getting the dose in their midteens through their twenties will continue to need all three doses, per the CDC.

In addition, the drugmaker said earnings per share, excluding items, came in at $1.07 for the quarter, beating the consensus estimate of 99 cents reported by Investor’s Business Daily. “The latest achievements for Keytruda and other recent regulatory approvals across our portfolio show that our innovation strategy is working,” Chairman and CEO Kenneth C. Frazier said in a prepared statement. “We are confident that our focus on the science, along with continued commercial execution, will drive long-term results for the company and our shareholders.” Merck said sales came in at $10.5 billion for the quarter, up 5 percent from the year-ago period, while diluted earnings came in at 78 cents per share, up from 64 cents in the third quarter of 2015. The earnings of $1.07, excluding items, topped the year-ago figure of 96 cents, as well. Net income came in at $2.2 billion, up from $1.8 billion a year earlier, while net income excluding items was just under $3 billion, up from $2.7 billion. Finally, Merck narrowed and raised its full-year diluted EPS estimate to a range of $2.02 to $2.09, and its estimated EPS, excluding items, to a range of $3.71 to $3.78. It also narrowed and raised its full-year revenue estimate to a range of $39.7 billion to $40.2 billion.

JOHNSON, AP Medical Writer Updated: Oct 25, 2016 - 11:38 AM Twtter KENILWORTH, N.J. - Higher sales of vaccines and prescription medicines, coupled with restrained spending, helped Merck & Co. post a 20 percent jump in third-quarter profit, trouncing Wall Street expectations. The maker of Januvia diabetes pills raised and narrowed its 2016 financial forecasts, but noted some headwinds, including the start of U.S. generic competition to three drugs by year's end. Its shares edged higher in midday trading Tuesday. The second-biggest U.S. drugmaker is in transition, with revenue from older products such as immune disorder treatment Remicade and the Dulera asthma inhaler leveling off or falling amid increased competition. But sales are building for drugs launched since 2014, particularly immuno-oncology drug Keytruda and hepatitis C-curing Zepatier. Meanwhile, Zinplava for preventing recurrence of life-threatening C. difficile infections was approved Friday in the U.S., and Merck plans to apply soon for approval of experimental diabetes drug ertugliflozin and additional uses for Keytruda, its newest blockbuster, with more than $1 billion in sales over the past four quarters. In addition, chief executive Ken Frazier told analysts during a conference call that deals to boost Merck's pipeline of experimental drugs, with a focus on small -to-midsized assets that fit well within its business, are a priority. He noted Merck is calling attention to the innovation of its medicines amid the U.S. political furor over soaring drug prices. "We don't think these environmental pricing pressures will ease," Frazier said. Merck reported net income of $2.18 billion, or 78 cents per share. Adjusted for one-time gains and costs, earnings came to $1.07 per share, eclipsing the 98 cents analysts expected. The Kenilworth, New Jersey-based drugmaker reported revenue of $10.54 billion, up 5 percent and above Street forecasts for $10.24 billion. Sales of prescription drugs rose 6 percent to $9.44 billion, led by higher sales for Keytruda, cholesterol pill Zetia, drugs used in hospitals and Gardasil and other vaccines. Top seller Januvia and combination drug Jamumet, for Type 2 diabetes, saw sales dip 1 percent to a combined $1.56 billion. Sales of cholesterol medicines Zetia and Vytorin, which should face generic competition by year's end, edged up 1 percent to $944 million. Antibiotic Cubicin also is getting generic competition this quarter. Gardasil, a vaccine against cancer-causing human papilloma virus, saw sales jump 38 percent to $860 million, boosted by a higher U.S. price for a new version that protects against more strains of HPV, higher U.S. demand and purchases by government health programs. Children's vaccine Proquad also benefited from U.S. health program stockpiling, raising sales 28 percent to $496 million. Keytruda, one of the hot new cancer drugs that work by boosting the immune system to fight tumors, posted sales of $364 million, up 124 percent. Late Monday, the immuno-oncology drug won U.S. approval - two months ahead of schedule - for using Keytruda in bigger patient groups, including those newly diagnosed with lung cancer. Cancer drugs typically are approved initially for use after multiple other drugs have failed patients, then gradually allowed to be used earlier in treatment. Keytruda is already approved as a second-line treatment for lung cancer and for melanoma and head and neck cancer. It's being tested in about 300 patient studies, alone and combined with chemotherapy or other immuno-oncology drugs. "We are excited by the long-term potential of Keytruda against many different tumor types," pharmaceutical marketing head Adam Schechter told the analysts. Sanford Bernstein analyst Dr. Timothy Anderson wrote to investors that the early approval "helps cement the product's lead versus competitors in the large lung cancer market," which should further raise Keytruda sales. Sales of veterinary medicines rose 5 percent to $865 million, driven partly by the Bravecto line of flea and tick products. Merck now expects full-year earnings of $2.02 to $2.09, up from its July forecast of $1.98 to $2.08, and revenue of $39.7 billion to $40.2 billion, up from $39.1 billion to $40.1 billion. In midday trading, Merck shares rose 74 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $61.49 as the broader markets declined. Merck shares have risen more than 16 percent over the past year. _____ Follow Linda A.

 Merck raises its full-year forecast because one drug has been crushing it Ankur Banerjee, Reuters Oct. 25, 2016, 7:23 AM 1,431 facebook linkedin twitter email print A view of the Merck & Co. campus in Linden, New Jersey Thomson Reuters Merck & Co Inc reported a better-than-expected quarterly revenue, driven primarily by higher demand for its new cancer drug Keytruda and raised its full-year forecast. Merck shares were up 1.65 percent in premarket trading at $61.75 on Tuesday. The second-largest U.S. drugmaker is betting on Keytruda to boost earnings as demand wanes for its diabetes franchise, Januvia and a related combination medicine called Janumet, as well as its Remicade arthritis drug. The company said on Monday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Keytruda for use in certain previously untreated lung cancer patients, making it the only approved first-line treatment. Keytruda quarterly sales rose to $356 million from $159 million. Total sales for the company increased 5 percent to $10.54 billion, above analysts' estimate of $10.18 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income attributable rose to $2.18 billion, or 78 cents per share, for the third quarter from $1.83 billion, or 64 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $1.07 per share, beating estimates of 99 cents per share. The company said it has narrowed and raised its full-year 2016 GAAP earnings to $2.02-$2.09 per share. It has also narrowed and raised its full-year revenue range to $39.7 billion -$40.2 billion.

Cancer drugs typically are approved initially for use after multiple other drugs have failed patients, then gradually allowed to be used earlier in treatment. Keytruda is already approved as a second-line treatment for lung cancer and for melanoma and head and neck cancer. It's being tested in about 300 patient studies, alone and combined with chemotherapy or other immuno-oncology drugs. "We are excited by the long-term potential of Keytruda against many different tumour types," pharmaceutical marketing head Adam Schechter told the analysts. Sanford Bernstein analyst Dr. Timothy Anderson wrote to investors that the early approval "helps cement the product's lead versus competitors in the large lung cancer market," which should further raise Keytruda sales. Sales of veterinary medicines rose 5 per cent to $865 million, driven partly by the Bravecto line of flea and tick products. Merck now expects full-year earnings of $2.02 to $2.09, up from its July forecast of $1.98 to $2.08, and revenue of $39.7 billion to $40.2 billion, up from $39.1 billion to $40.1 billion. In midday trading, Merck shares rose 74 cents, or 1.2 per cent, to $61.49 as the broader markets declined. Merck shares have risen more than 16 per cent over the past year. _____ Follow Linda A.

Merck reports financial results Tuesday, Oct. 25, 2016. (AP Photo/Mel Evans, File) Posted: Tuesday, October 25, 2016 10:38 am | Updated: 11:16 am, Tue Oct 25, 2016. Merck breezes past 3Q profit expectations, raises forecast Associated Press | Higher sales of vaccines and prescription medicines, coupled with restrained spending, helped Merck & Co. post a 20 percent jump in third-quarter profit, trouncing Wall Street expectations. The maker of Januvia diabetes pills raised and narrowed its 2016 financial forecasts, but noted some headwinds, including the start of U.S. generic competition to three drugs by year's end. Its shares edged higher in midday trading Tuesday. The second-biggest U.S. drugmaker is in transition, with revenue from older products such as immune disorder treatment Remicade and the Dulera asthma inhaler leveling off or falling amid increased competition. But sales are building for drugs launched since 2014, particularly immuno-oncology drug Keytruda and hepatitis C-curing Zepatier. Meanwhile, Zinplava for preventing recurrence of life-threatening C. difficile infections was approved Friday in the U.S., and Merck plans to apply soon for approval of experimental diabetes drug ertugliflozin and additional uses for Keytruda, its newest blockbuster, with more than $1 billion in sales over the past four quarters. In addition, chief executive Ken Frazier told analysts during a conference call that deals to boost Merck's pipeline of experimental drugs, with a focus on small -to-midsized assets that fit well within its business, are a priority. He noted Merck is calling attention to the innovation of its medicines amid the U.S. political furor over soaring drug prices. "We don't think these environmental pricing pressures will ease," Frazier said. Merck reported net income of $2.18 billion, or 78 cents per share. Adjusted for one-time gains and costs, earnings came to $1.07 per share, eclipsing the 98 cents analysts expected. The Kenilworth, New Jersey-based drugmaker reported revenue of $10.54 billion, up 5 percent and above Street forecasts for $10.24 billion. Sales of prescription drugs rose 6 percent to $9.44 billion, led by higher sales for Keytruda, cholesterol pill Zetia, drugs used in hospitals and Gardasil and other vaccines. Top seller Januvia and combination drug Jamumet, for Type 2 diabetes, saw sales dip 1 percent to a combined $1.56 billion. Sales of cholesterol medicines Zetia and Vytorin, which should face generic competition by year's end, edged up 1 percent to $944 million. Antibiotic Cubicin also is getting generic competition this quarter. Gardasil, a vaccine against cancer-causing human papilloma virus, saw sales jump 38 percent to $860 million, boosted by a higher U.S. price for a new version that protects against more strains of HPV, higher U.S. demand and purchases by government health programs. Children's vaccine Proquad also benefited from U.S. health program stockpiling, raising sales 28 percent to $496 million. Keytruda, one of the hot new cancer drugs that work by boosting the immune system to fight tumors, posted sales of $364 million, up 124 percent. Late Monday, the immuno-oncology drug won U.S. approval — two months ahead of schedule — for using Keytruda in bigger patient groups, including those newly diagnosed with lung cancer.

(NYSE:MRK) this morning posted better-than-expected Q3 results, lifted its 2016 outlook, and provided a bullish update on a key cancer treatment. The Kenilworth, NJ-based company reported Q3 EPS of $1.07, beating out Wall Street’s $0.99 estimate. Revenue rose 4.6% from last year to $10.54 billion, also topping analysts’ view of $10.18 billion. Looking ahead, MRK boosted its full-year earnings outlook to a range of $3.71-3.78 per share, up from $3.67-3.77. Analysts are looking for $3.75 per share for the year. Merck guided full-year revenue of $39.7 to $40.2 billion, up from a prior range of $39.1 to $40.1 billion and above Wall Street’s view of $39.69 billion. In drug news, Merck said sales of its cancer-fighting immunotherapy treatment Keytruda rose to $356 million in the third quarter, which was just shy of estimates. The FDA just yesterday approved two supplemental Biologics License Applications (sBLA) for Keytruda in lung cancer, as well. The company commented via press release: “The latest achievements for KEYTRUDA and other recent regulatory approvals across our portfolio show that our innovation strategy is working,” said Kenneth C. Frazier, chairman and chief executive officer, Merck. “We are confident that our focus on the science, along with continued commercial execution, will drive long-term results for the company and our shareholders.” Merck shares rose $0.86 (+1.42%) to $61.61 in premarket trading Tuesday. Prior to today’s report, MRK had gained 15%, more than doubling the 5.41% return of the benchmark S&P 500 during the same period.

REUTERS/Jeff Zelevansky  (Copyright Reuters 2015) Merck & Co Inc on Monday said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved its immunotherapy Keytruda for use in certain previously untreated lung cancer patients, making it the only approved first-line treatment. The drug has been approved for treating metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with high-levels of a protein known for suppressing the immune system called PD-L1. More on this... 'New day' in lung cancer as Merck drug shines, works with chemo Roche's lung cancer drug wins US approval Family doctors don't always screen smokers for lung cancer Keytruda works by taking the brakes off the immune system by blocking the interaction between PD-L1 and another protein, PD-1. The drug has already been approved for patients who have undergone previous chemotherapy for advanced non-small lung cancer. Monday's announcement gives Merck the only approved first-line treatment for lung cancer, one of the biggest markets for cancer drugs. Rival Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's drug Opdivo failed a late-stage trial for the same indication. The approval was based on data from a late-stage study which showed Keytruda achieved superior progression-free and overall survival compared to chemotherapy in patients whose tumors expressed high levels of the protein, Merck said. Doctors are currently allowed to prescribe medicines for not yet approved uses but FDA's approval of Keytruda could greatly increase the number of patients taking the drug. Shares of Kenilworth, New Jersey-based drugmaker fell 0.7 percent in aftermarket trade. Up to Monday's close, the stock had gained more than 15 percent of its value year to date.

Der bereinigte Gewinn je Aktie kletterte im dritten Quartal um elf Prozent auf 1,07 US-Dollar, wie das Unternehmen am Dienstag mitteilte. Der Umsatz legte um 4,6 Prozent auf 10,5 Milliarden Dollar (9,65 Mrd Euro) zu. Damit übertraf der Konzern die Erwartungen von Analysten. Der Gewinn unterm Strich legte um ein Fünftel auf 2,18 Milliarden Dollar zu. Auch für das Gesamtjahr zeigte sich der Konzern zuversichtlicher und hob die Prognosen an. Der bereinigte Gewinn je Aktie dürfte im laufenden Jahr nun zwischen 3,71 und 3,78 Dollar liegen. Bisher wurden 3,67 bis 3,77 Dollar angepeilt. Beim Umsatz rechnet das Unternehmen nun damit, zwischen 39,7 und 40,2 zu landen. Bisher lag die Spanne bei 39,1 bis 40,1 Milliarden. Mercks Verkaufsschlager, das Diabetes-Mittel Januvia, verzeichnete im dritten Quartal allerdings einen leichten Umsatzrückgang. Das Krebsmedikament Keytruda legte hingegen deutlich zu. Auch der Impfstoff Gardasil verzeichnete hohe Zuwächse.

While the two older drugs performed well, Merck is depending on newer products like cancer treatment Keytruda, its crown jewel, to revive growth as longtime franchise products face competition from cheaper generics. On Monday, two months earlier than expected, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved it for first-line use in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. The broader label is expected to more double Keytruda sales to about $3.3 billion in 2017. Earnings excluding some items were $1.07 a share, the Kenilworth, New Jersey-based company said Tuesday in a statement, compared with the 99-cent average of predictions compiled by Bloomberg. Sales of Keytruda, at $356 million, fell short of the $371 million average estimate. “Keytruda was weak but that’s before the first-line launch, which everyone is excited about,” said Alex Arfaei, an analyst at BMO who rates the stock outperform. The shares rose 1.7 percent to $61.77 at 2:17 p.m. in New York. Keytruda’s momentum has been high after its main competitor, Opdivo from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., failed in a large, late-stage trial. Merck is conducting more tests than any of its competitors in PD-L1 inhibitors, the immunotherapy mechanism of action in battling cancer, according to Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analyst Tim Anderson, who rates the stock outperform. Merck is actively looking for ways to expand its pipeline, including “bolt-on” acquisitions, Chief Executive Officer Ken Frazier said on a conference call with analysts. Sales of the diabetes treatments Januvia and Janumet slipped 1.4 percent to $1.55 billion, compared with analysts’ projection of $1.62 billion. The pills are Merck’s biggest products and could face competition from generics and Eli Lilly & Co.’s Jardiance, which is waiting for approval from the U.S. government for claims that it cuts down the risk of death from cardiac events. Merck also received a one-time boost of $150 million in sales in Japan after shipment timings were moved to accommodate a new software system the drugmaker will implement in the fourth quarter, the company said in the statement. Gardasil had sales of $860 million compared with analysts’ predictions of $629 million. Cubicin sold $320 million, compared with estimates of $209 million. Other highlights from the third quarter: Merck raised its 2016 revenue projection to $39.7 billion to $40.2 billion, compared to a July estimate of $39.1 billion to $40.1 billion.  The drugmaker raised its forecast for full-year adjusted earnings to $3.71 to $3.78 a share, compared with a previous projection of $3.67 to $3.77 a share. Quarterly net income rose to $2.18 billion, or 78 cents a share, from $1.83 billion, or 64 cents, a year earlier. Revenue gained 4.6 percent to $10.5 billion, topping analysts’ estimates of $10.2 billion. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The US FDA approved the drug two months ahead of schedule for patients with advanced NSCLC whose tumours express high levels of PD-L1 (i.e. with 50% or more of the cells producing the biomarker). In the KEYNOTE-024 trial, Keytruda improved both progression-free survival and overall survival compared to platinum-based chemotherapy in these patients. The green light gives Merck another opportunity to gain ground on its arch-rival Bristol-Myers Squibb, whose PD-1 inhibitor Opdivo (nivolumab) is currently outselling Keytruda by a factor of three. In the first six months of the year sales of Opdivo came in at $1.54bn, with Keytruda bringing in $563m. Keytruda, Opdivo and Roche's new PD-L1 inhibitor Tecentriq (atezolizumab) are all approved for second-line treatment after chemotherapy in NSCLC patients, but claiming the first-line indication is expected to be crucial for future dominance in the big NSCLC market. BMS' drug performed worse than chemotherapy in the CheckMate-026 trial, and initially it was thought that the company's 'all-comer' strategy of enrolling NSCLC patients with both high and low PD-L1 expression may have been the cause. A closer look at the data gave no comfort however, with the drug failing to show any effect regardless of the PD-L1 expression status of patients. Opdivo's stumble means Keytruda will likely be the only immuno-oncology option for previously-untreated NSCLC until Roche completes its phase III first-line programme for Tecentriq, which is due to generate its first results in 2018. Roche is also testing Tecentriq in combination with chemotherapy in NSCLC patients with high and low PD-L1 expression levels, while BMS is hoping that an all-comer trial looking at the combination of its two current immuno-oncology drugs - Opdivo and CTLA4 inhibitor Yervoy (ipilimumab) - could tip the balance in its favour once again. Merck will make hay in the meantime, and with PD-L1 testing becoming more common in the first-line setting there could be a pull-through effect for Keytruda into second-line treatment, further lessening Opdivo's advantage in this form of cancer. Keytruda's competitive position in second-line has also been improved by another FDA approval, this time for labelling that will make patients who have failed to improve with chemotherapy eligible for pembrolizumab even if their tumours produce a low level of PD-L1.

Johnson, The Associated Press   0 Higher sales of vaccines and prescription medicines, coupled with restrained spending, helped Merck & Co. post a 20 per cent jump in third-quarter profit, trouncing Wall Street expectations. The maker of Januvia diabetes pills raised and narrowed its 2016 financial forecasts, but noted some headwinds, including the start of U.S. generic competition to three drugs by year’s end. Its shares edged higher in midday trading Tuesday. The second-biggest U.S. drugmaker is in transition, with revenue from older products such as immune disorder treatment Remicade and the Dulera asthma inhaler levelling off or falling amid increased competition. But sales are building for drugs launched since 2014, particularly immuno-oncology drug Keytruda and hepatitis C-curing Zepatier. Meanwhile, Zinplava for preventing recurrence of life-threatening C. difficile infections was approved Friday in the U.S., and Merck plans to apply soon for approval of experimental diabetes drug ertugliflozin and additional uses for Keytruda, its newest blockbuster, with more than $1 billion in sales over the past four quarters. In addition, chief executive Ken Frazier told analysts during a conference call that deals to boost Merck’s pipeline of experimental drugs, with a focus on small -to-midsized assets that fit well within its business, are a priority. He noted Merck is calling attention to the innovation of its medicines amid the U.S. political furor over soaring drug prices. “We don’t think these environmental pricing pressures will ease,” Frazier said. Merck reported net income of $2.18 billion, or 78 cents per share. Adjusted for one-time gains and costs, earnings came to $1.07 per share, eclipsing the 98 cents analysts expected. The Kenilworth, New Jersey-based drugmaker reported revenue of $10.54 billion, up 5 per cent and above Street forecasts for $10.24 billion. Sales of prescription drugs rose 6 per cent to $9.44 billion, led by higher sales for Keytruda, cholesterol pill Zetia, drugs used in hospitals and Gardasil and other vaccines. Top seller Januvia and combination drug Jamumet, for Type 2 diabetes, saw sales dip 1 per cent to a combined $1.56 billion. Sales of cholesterol medicines Zetia and Vytorin, which should face generic competition by year’s end, edged up 1 per cent to $944 million. Antibiotic Cubicin also is getting generic competition this quarter. Gardasil, a vaccine against cancer-causing human papilloma virus, saw sales jump 38 per cent to $860 million, boosted by a higher U.S. price for a new version that protects against more strains of HPV, higher U.S. demand and purchases by government health programs. Children’s vaccine Proquad also benefited from U.S. health program stockpiling, raising sales 28 per cent to $496 million. Keytruda, one of the hot new cancer drugs that work by boosting the immune system to fight tumors, posted sales of $364 million, up 124 per cent. Late Monday, the immuno-oncology drug won U.S. approval — two months ahead of schedule — for using Keytruda in bigger patient groups, including those newly diagnosed with lung cancer. Cancer drugs typically are approved initially for use after multiple other drugs have failed patients, then gradually allowed to be used earlier in treatment. Keytruda is already approved as a second-line treatment for lung cancer and for melanoma and head and neck cancer. It’s being tested in about 300 patient studies, alone and combined with chemotherapy or other immuno-oncology drugs. “We are excited by the long-term potential of Keytruda against many different tumour types,” pharmaceutical marketing head Adam Schechter told the analysts. Sanford Bernstein analyst Dr. Timothy Anderson wrote to investors that the early approval “helps cement the product’s lead versus competitors in the large lung cancer market,” which should further raise Keytruda sales. Sales of veterinary medicines rose 5 per cent to $865 million, driven partly by the Bravecto line of flea and tick products. Merck now expects full-year earnings of $2.02 to $2.09, up from its July forecast of $1.98 to $2.08, and revenue of $39.7 billion to $40.2 billion, up from $39.1 billion to $40.1 billion. In midday trading, Merck shares rose 74 cents, or 1.2 per cent, to $61.49 as the broader markets declined. Merck shares have risen more than 16 per cent over the past year. _____ Follow Linda A.

Print Share All News Consumer Pharma New Drugs Pipeline Clinical Trials FDA Alerts Merck Announces Pivotal Phase 3 Study of Letermovir Met Primary Endpoint Tweet KENILWORTH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE) October 19, 2016 -- Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the pivotal Phase 3 clinical study of letermovir, an investigational antiviral medicine, met its primary endpoint. The global, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluated the efficacy and safety of letermovir for the prevention of clinically-significant cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in adult (18 years and older) CMV-seropositive recipients of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Merck will submit results from the study for presentation at a future scientific conference. “There is an unmet need for therapeutic options in the prevention of CMV infection in high-risk allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president of clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. “Merck is pleased this pivotal Phase 3 study with letermovir met its primary endpoint. We thank the patients and families who participated in this study and we look forward to presenting results at a future scientific meeting.” In the study, letermovir was administered once daily, either in oral tablet or IV formulation. Letermovir was started as early as the day of HSCT transplant and no later than 28 days post-transplant, and continued through approximately 100 days after transplant. The primary outcome measure was the percentage of participants with clinically-significant CMV infection through 24 weeks after transplant. Additional details about the study can be found online at www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02137772. About Letermovir Letermovir is an investigational once-daily antiviral medicine under development for the prevention of CMV infection and disease. It is a member of a new class of non-nucleoside CMV inhibitors (3,4 dihydro-quinazolines) and inhibits viral replication by targeting the viral terminase complex. Letermovir has been granted orphan designation by the European Medicines Agency, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for the prevention of CMV infection and disease in at-risk populations. Letermovir also has been granted Fast Track designation by the FDA. Under an agreement signed in 2012, Merck (through a subsidiary) purchased worldwide rights to develop and commercialize letermovir from AiCuris GmbH & Co KG (www.aicuris.com).

In 2.14pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a 0.03 percent advance. The Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 0.7 percent. In 2pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.3 percent. In the Dow gains in shares of Boeing and those of Nike, recently trading 4.2 percent and 1.9 percent higher respectively, offset slides in shares of Apple and those of Merck, down 3 percent and 2.2 percent respectively. While Apple’s latest quarterly earnings per share exceeded analysts expectations, analysts were disappointed with its outlook for iPhone sales—especially given the rival Samsung’s woes. "In essence, in China and elsewhere, while Apple’s products are still seen favourably, the distance between Apple and its competitors is nowhere near as great as it once was," Neil Saunders, head of retail research firm Conlumino, wrote in a note, according to Reuters. The latest US economic data were better than anticipated. The US trade deficit shrank 5.2 percent to US$56.1 billion in September, bolstering hope that third-quarter GDP growth might beat expectations. “We now believe the boost from trade could be closer to a full percentage point, almost twice what we had expected," Michelle Girard, chief economist at RBS in Stamford, Connecticut, told Reuters. Girard said she now predicts real GDP growth in the third quarter of 3.3 percent. Separately, a Commerce Department report showed new home sales rose 3.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 593,000 units in September, an unexpected gain. Mondelez International shares climbed, up 3.6 percent as of 1.35pm in New York, after the maker of Cadbury chocolate upgraded its full-year profit forecast. The company has increased its full-year adjusted earnings per share outlook and now expects growth of about 25 percent on a constant-currency basis, Mondelez said in a statement. "Our third quarter results underscore our continued commitment to improve operational efficiency, expand margins and profitably grow volume while also investing in strategic growth initiatives for the longer term," CEO Irene Rosenfeld said in the statement. “In the face of challenging market conditions, we're building a stronger, more streamlined company that is well positioned to deliver sustainable, profitable growth and attractive cash generation,” Rosenfeld noted. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the day with a 0.4 percent slide from the previous close. France’s CAC 40 Index slipped 0.1 percent, Germany’s DAX Index declined 0.4 percent lower, while the UK’s FTSE 100 Index shed 0.9 percent. Germany’s Bayer, which agreed to buy Monsanto in a US$66 billion deal, reported better-than-expected quarterly profit bolstered by its pharmaceutical unit. Even so, Bayer shares closed 1.4 percent lower in Frankfurt as investors were concerned about weakness in its Crop Science division. Pharmaceuticals posted “encouraging” sales growth of 7.6 percent in the quarter, Consumer Health sales grew 3.6 percent, while sales of Crop Science were level year on year, Bayer said. “Earnings are not strong enough to fuel markets,” Ralf Zimmermann, an equity strategist at Bankhaus Lampe in Dusseldorf, Germany, told Bloomberg. “Some investors who had expected accelerating earnings may be disappointed.” (BusinessDesk) © Scoop Media BusinessDesk Independent, Trustworthy New Zealand Business News The Wellington-based BusinessDesk team led by former Bloomberg Asian top editor Jonathan Underhill and Qantas Award-winning journalist and commentator Pattrick Smellie provides a daily news feed for a serious business audience.

(Courtesy of Changing Markets) The discharge from factories that produce antibiotics is a hotbed for growth of so-called “superbugs,” according to a report released Oct. 19 by environmental advocacy organization Changing Markets. Superbugs are bacteria that have developed a resistance to antibiotics. This antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major global health concern, rising to the level of HIV and Ebola. On Sept. 21, it became the fourth health issue ever taken up at the U.N. General Assembly.  A UN statement released after the meeting summarized the gravity of the problem: “Common and life-threatening infections like pneumonia, gonorrhea, and post-operative infections, as well as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria are increasingly becoming untreatable because of AMR.” While the two leading causes of AMR are (1) excessive human consumption of antibiotics and (2) the use of antibiotics in rearing livestock, industry leaders are increasingly treating pollution from pharmaceutical manufacturing with urgency as a third major cause.  Ahead of the General Assembly meeting, 13 major pharmaceutical companies—including American companies Pfizer, Merck & Co., and Johnson & Johnson—announced commitments to battle AMR. At the top of their list was to “review our own manufacturing and supply chains to assess good practice in controlling releases of antibiotics into the environment.” They plan to establish a common framework for managing antibiotic discharge and put it into practice by 2018. Pfizer was identified by Changing Markets as one of the American companies that sources from factories in India and China, which are the main offenders. The report also identified American pharmaceutical companies McKesson and CVS Health as sourcing from factories that cause AMR, and it urged them and all American and European companies to clean up their supply chains. About 80 percent of active pharmaceutical ingredients in U.S. drugs are sourced from overseas, mostly from India and China. McKesson spokesperson Jennifer Nelson told Epoch Times via email: “McKesson understands that protecting the integrity of the supply chain is critically important to global health as well as to our business. … We are aware of claims against some of our suppliers and are actively reviewing the matter. We will take action if necessary.” CVS Health did not respond to inquiries. Both companies source from Aurobindo Pharma, based in Hyderabad, India, which Changing Markets identified as one of the worst offenders. The company has grown about 800 percent in the past decade, with its biggest market (55 percent) in the United States, according to the report. A file photo of an Aurobindo pharmaceutical factory in Pydibhimavaram, India. (Courtesy of Changing Markets) About 80 percent of active pharmaceutical ingredients in U.S. drugs are sourced from overseas, mostly from India and China, according to the Institute of Medicine.  Superbugs know no boundaries, easily spreading from factory effluent in India to the rest of the world. The superbugs can spread through the country’s waterways, to farmland and drinking water for livestock and people, and can easily hitch a ride on people or goods traveling abroad. The report touched on another emerging concern in the spread of these superbugs: Chinese pharmaceutical manufacturers are disposing of their solid waste, including antibiotic residues, by making it into fertilizer. Thus antibiotics are being spread over soil far and wide. “While experts see this as highly problematic from an environmental and human health perspective, the lack of specific laws or regulations covering fertilizer provides companies with a legal loophole which they are only too keen to exploit,” the report stated. Out of 34 sites tested, 16 were found to contain bacteria resistant to antibiotics. Dr. Mark Holmes from the University of Cambridge worked with Changing Markets to study the concentration of antibiotics and superbugs in some Indian waterways. Out of 34 sites tested, 16 were found to contain bacteria resistant to antibiotics. Holmes concluded, as have several other studies in recent years, that the pharmaceutical waste is greatly contributing to the development of superbugs in India’s waterways. An example of another study with similar results was one conducted by researchers at Sweden’s University of Gothenburg in 2014. They found that Kazipally Lake in India, affected by the dumping of pharmaceutical waste, harbored 81 types of resistance genes against “essentially every major class of antibiotics.” That’s 7,000 times more AMR than a lake in Sweden tested for comparison.  (Greentea Latte/Shutterstock) (Funnyangel/Shutterstock) The Changing Markets report not only highlighted the problem of pollution from pharmaceutical factories in Asia, it also traced the supply chains in the greatest detail yet from Asia to America and Europe. It called for greater transparency, as it was difficult, and in many cases impossible, to find the links in the chains using data that is publicly available. FDA Beyond US Borders The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sends inspectors to Indian and Chinese pharmaceutical factories, and has made great strides toward cleaning up the problems, though many remain. In 2015 alone, the FDA issued notices of manufacturing violations at 80 Chinese production sites. Such a notice usually results in an import ban.  In an email to Epoch Times, the FDA stated: “Drug products approved for marketing in the U.S. are held to the same quality standards regardless of their manufacturing location. Our application review and facility inspections are conducted with the same rigor independent of geographic location of the manufacturer.” The inspectors take into consideration how the companies handle their waste, the FDA said, according to general manufacturing process regulations, such as “Trash and organic waste matter shall be held and disposed of in a timely and sanitary manner” (21 CFR 211.56).   As AMR death tolls rise, Former Rep. Henry Waxman and Department of Health and Human Services Deputy Secretary Bill Corr are working on a campaign to encourage American companies to clean up their supply chains. They also encourage the FDA to pressure authorities in India and China to strengthen local regulations. Every year in the United States at least 2 million people become ill from superbugs, and at least 23,000 die, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Globally, about 700,000 die annually, according to a report commissioned by the British government this spring, and that number is expected to grow to 10 million annually by 2050.

While you were sleeping: UPDATED US stocks mixed, Apple slides on outlook Margreet Dietz Thursday October 27, 2016 Share Play NBR radio on Stocks on Wall Street were mixed amid a disappointing outlook from Apple. Energy stocks fell with the price of oil but Boeing boosted the blue chips. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 30.06 points, or 0.2%, to 18,199.33. The Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 0.6% to 5250.27 and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index eased 0.2% to 2139.43. In the Dow gains in Boeing and Nike shares, trading 4.7% and 1.9% higher respectively, offset slides in Apple and Merck shares, down 2.2% and 2.0% respectively. While Apple's latest quarterly earnings per share exceeded analysts’ expectations, they were disappointed with its outlook for iPhone sales, especially given rival Samsung's woes. "In essence, in China and elsewhere, while Apple's products are still seen favourably, the distance between Apple and its competitors is nowhere near as great as it once was," retail research firm Conlumino head Neil Saunders wrote in a note, according to Reuters. The latest US economic data were better than anticipated. The US trade deficit shrank 5.2% to $US56.1 billion in September, bolstering hope the third-quarter GDP growth might beat expectations. "We now believe the boost from trade could be closer to a full percentage point, almost twice what we had expected," Connecticut-based RBS chief economist Michelle Girard told Reuters. Ms Girard now predicts real GDP growth in the third quarter at 3.3%. Separately, a Commerce Department report showed new home sales rose 3.1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 593,000 units in September, an unexpected gain. Mondelez improves Mondelez International shares climbed 3.6% after the maker of Cadbury chocolate upgraded its full-year profit forecast.

In 2.14pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a 0.03 percent advance. The Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 0.7 percent. In 2pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.3 percent. In the Dow gains in shares of Boeing and those of Nike, recently trading 4.2 percent and 1.9 percent higher respectively, offset slides in shares of Apple and those of Merck, down 3 percent and 2.2 percent respectively. While Apple’s latest quarterly earnings per share exceeded analysts expectations, analysts were disappointed with its outlook for iPhone sales—especially given the rival Samsung’s woes. “In essence, in China and elsewhere, while Apple’s products are still seen favourably, the distance between Apple and its competitors is nowhere near as great as it once was,” Neil Saunders, head of retail research firm Conlumino, wrote in a note, according to Reuters. The latest US economic data were better than anticipated. The US trade deficit shrank 5.2 percent to US$56.1 billion in September, bolstering hope that third-quarter GDP growth might beat expectations. “We now believe the boost from trade could be closer to a full percentage point, almost twice what we had expected,” Michelle Girard, chief economist at RBS in Stamford, Connecticut, told Reuters. Girard said she now predicts real GDP growth in the third quarter of 3.3 percent. Separately, a Commerce Department report showed new home sales rose 3.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 593,000 units in September, an unexpected gain. Mondelez International shares climbed, up 3.6 percent as of 1.35pm in New York, after the maker of Cadbury chocolate upgraded its full-year profit forecast. The company has increased its full-year adjusted earnings per share outlook and now expects growth of about 25 percent on a constant-currency basis, Mondelez said in a statement. “Our third quarter results underscore our continued commitment to improve operational efficiency, expand margins and profitably grow volume while also investing in strategic growth initiatives for the longer term,” CEO Irene Rosenfeld said in the statement. “In the face of challenging market conditions, we’re building a stronger, more streamlined company that is well positioned to deliver sustainable, profitable growth and attractive cash generation,” Rosenfeld noted. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the day with a 0.4 percent slide from the previous close. France’s CAC 40 Index slipped 0.1 percent, Germany’s DAX Index declined 0.4 percent lower, while the UK’s FTSE 100 Index shed 0.9 percent. Germany’s Bayer, which agreed to buy Monsanto in a US$66 billion deal, reported better-than-expected quarterly profit bolstered by its pharmaceutical unit. Even so, Bayer shares closed 1.4 percent lower in Frankfurt as investors were concerned about weakness in its Crop Science division. Pharmaceuticals posted “encouraging” sales growth of 7.6 percent in the quarter, Consumer Health sales grew 3.6 percent, while sales of Crop Science were level year on year, Bayer said. “Earnings are not strong enough to fuel markets,” Ralf Zimmermann, an equity strategist at Bankhaus Lampe in Dusseldorf, Germany, told Bloomberg. “Some investors who had expected accelerating earnings may be disappointed.” (BusinessDesk) Content Sourced from scoop.co.nz Original url  Print This Post Tweet     Blogroll China Economic Scan Compare house prices Deposit Rates Direct Broking – NZX & ASX Trading & Prices Findata – Market Data Good Returns Herald Business Interest.co.nz – Interest Rates News & Views National Business Review Property Talk Sharechat Stuff Business Value Cruncher – NZX Latest Business news Tower estimates quake could trim profit by up to $7.2 mln NZ dollar little changed below 71 US cents as greenback Unique chance to develop consented lifestyle land in Twizel Candidates for Fonterra Board of Directors’ Election Go Green Expo a breeding ground for pseudoscience Update to Wellington roads Wellington highways closed due to surface flooding When strangers call bearing investment gifts: hang up Fonterra chooses Epson projectors for dynamic edge blending Balex Marine makes the finals of international design awards Auckland more productive than other urban centres in NZ Advisory group a boost for NZ smart agriculture Bluebridge Cook Strait Ferry Update Wellington motorists asked to avoid unnecessary travel Update on insurance response to North Canterbury earthquake Text Links Recent Comments Lan: Unbelievable that a WEST AUSTR... jackp: Murray, when Key is involved t...

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and excluding some costs, rose 6 percent to 2.68 billion euros ($2.92 billion) last quarter, the Leverkusen, Germany-based company said in a statement Wednesday. That compared with the 2.53 billion-euro average of analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Bayer's pharmaceuticals once again sustained earnings, led by demand for medicines such as the blood thinner Xarelto. The German company last month raised the annual sales forecast for its latest blockbuster drugs -- including Xarelto and the eye treatment Eylea -- to more than 10 billion euros from 7.5 billion euros. Crop sciences, which will probably replace prescription medicines as Bayer's biggest business after the Monsanto takeover is completed, showed little growth. Bayer shares fell 2.2 percent to 89.51 euros at 11:22 a.m. in Frankfurt trading after the company said brands like Claritin and Coppertone, gained with the purchase of Merck & Co.'s over-the-counter medicines in 2014, were a drag on the consumer health business. Earnings at the division dropped 3,5 percent last quarter. The unit's performance "underlines how disappointing the Merck over-the-counter integration has been," wrote Alistair Campbell, an analyst at Berenberg Bank, in a note to clients. Funded with a combination of debt and equity, the Monsanto purchase will leave the German company little scope for acquisitions to boost its pharmaceutical business. Bayer on Wednesday said it had finalized the syndication of a $57 billion bridge loan at the start of the month. It expects to apply for regulatory approval of the transaction this year in the U.S. and probably in the first quarter in the European Union and doesn't expect any major holdups. "This is a very manageable risk," Chief Executive Officer Werner Baumann said in an interview with Bloomberg TV's Guy Johnson and Caroline Hyde, pointing to Monsanto's relatively small presence outside the Americas. "We are very confident that we can resolve any issue that may come up there in product overlaps." Bayer isn't just working on buying Monsanto, it's also weighing the sale of its dermatology business, which includes the brand Desonate for eczema, according to people familiar with the plans. The German company may also offload its radiology business, which could be worth up to $3 billion, the people said. Bayer has agreed to a termination fee of $2 billion with Monsanto and may divest businesses from the combined entity with sales totaling $1.6 billion, if needed, to gain antitrust approval. Baumann declined to comment on whether the company plans to sell the radiology and dermatology units in a call with reporters. Bayer's sales rose 2 percent last quarter to 11.2 billion euros, buoyed by increased volumes of Xarelto in Europe and Japan. Older over-the-counter brands like Aleve and Alka-Seltzer also grew, but couldn't offset a broader cost-related decline at the consumer health unit. The "weak business environment, particularly in Latin America," held back crop science products in the quarter, the company said. Higher selling prices and a currency boost were offset by lower volumes and higher research spending in that business. Buying Monsanto will allow Bayer to tap growing demand as farmers seek to boost productivity to feed an estimated 10 billion people globally by 2050. Falling crop prices and a quest for greater efficiency have triggered a cascade of deals over the past year. DuPont Co. and Dow Chemical Co. have agreed to merge and then carve out a new crop-science unit and China National Chemical Corp. is buying Switzerland's Syngenta AG. Bayer's stock has declined almost 12 percent since March 21, when the possibility of a transaction with Monsanto first emerged. "In the short term we expect Bayer to remain trading below its intrinsic value as we await regulatory updates regarding the multiple agri-chemical transactions currently on the table," Peter Verdult, an analyst at Citigroup Inc., wrote in a note to clients. Bayer on Wednesday made a slight adjustment to its full-year outlook. Core earnings per share will probably rise by a high single-digit percentage this year, the company said. The previous forecast was for a gain of a mid- to high-single-digit percentage. It stuck to earlier estimates for two other measures of performance. In July, the company said sales this year would likely climb to between 46 billion euros and 47 billion euros including revenue from the plastics division Covestro AG. Ebitda before special items is likely to rise by a high-single-digit percentage. Bayer still holds a 64 percent stake in Covestro, which reported a 22 percent increase in profits on Tuesday.       Next Article Loading comment count... Commenting is closed.

Italy’s 10-year yield climbed to the highest since June after the country sold inflation-linked debt due in 2024 and 2026. The selloff deepened, with similar-maturity U.K. bond yields approaching the most since the Brexit vote, after the Bank of England said Tuesday there were limits to officials’ willingness to look beyond an overshoot of their inflation target. Gilts also declined after Britain sold 4 billion pounds ($4.9 billion) of securities due in July 2065 via banks on Tuesday. Portugal auctioned bonds for the first time since DBRS Ltd. maintained the nation’s credit rating as investment grade, securing eligibility of its debt for the European Central Bank’s asset-purchase program. Germany added to the weight of supply, selling 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) of five-year notes, while companies including Merck & Co. and Verizon Communications Inc. sold bonds. The Treasury in Rome plans to auction as much as 8.5 billion euros of debt on Oct. 28. “Gilts are leading us down, they’re underperforming, taking Europe as a whole after that,” said Craig Collins, managing director of rates trading at Bank of Montreal in London. U.K. bonds are vulnerable after Tuesday’s debt sale as well as “concerns about BOE policy,” he said, while the supply from euro-zone nations is “adding to the mix.” Italy’s 10-year bond yields climbed nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 1.48 percent as of 4:04 p.m. London time, the highest since June 28. The 1.6 percent bond due in June 2026 fell 0.84, or 8.40 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 101.15. Benchmark German 10-year bund yields rose seven basis points to 0.1 percent. Gilts Slide Yields on U.K. 10-year gilts increased eight basis points to 1.17 percent. The yield touched 1.22 percent on Oct. 17, the highest since the June 23 Brexit referendum. Portugal’s 10-year bond yield added three basis points to 3.22 percent. The auctions Wednesday came a day after Austria joined the club of countries to have issued ultra-long-maturity bonds when it sold 2 billion euros of 70-year securities via banks. The nation also placed 3 billion euros of notes maturing in July 2023. The Austrian central bank retained 500 million euros of both securities. “You have the perfect environment for a selloff,” said Martin van Vliet, an interest-rate strategist at ING Groep NV in Amsterdam. “First, you had this strong spillover from the gilts market. We also had some supply pressure with quite a lot of auctions.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Merck & Co. CEO Ken Frazier also spoke of his “serious concerns,” warning on his company’s earnings call that the law would “negatively impact millions of patients.” Known as Proposition 61, the initiative intends to bring down the cost of prescription drugs by prohibiting California state agencies, such as Medi-Cal and state prisons, from paying more than the price paid by the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs. While Medi-Cal, the state health program for the poor, already can negotiate with drug companies, the national VA typically gets the best deal. VA rates may be about 20 percent lower than Medicaid’s, according to Piper Jaffray analyst Joshua Schimmer. Political pressure The pharmaceutical industry has been under fire for how it prices its medications, with Mylan NV’s $600 EpiPen pack and Turing Pharmaceuticals AG’s 50-fold increase of an anti-parasitic’s price in the national spotlight. High-profile politicians also have weighed in: Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, has pledged to crack down on what she has called outrageous drug costs. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who has lambasted specific drugmakers for their pricing practices, supports Proposition 61. Opponents argue that the initiative won’t work as intended because drugmakers wouldn’t be required to offer the drugs at the VA price, meaning they could decline to offer California agencies some treatments, or raise the VA’s current drug prices. The law would apply only to about 25 percent of Medi-Cal enrollees who are part of its “fee-for-service” program, not to the remaining 75 percent who are in the Medi-Cal managed-care system. California’s Legislative Analyst’s Office says the potential for savings is unclear, given the uncertainty over how drug manufacturers will respond. Pricey proposition Proposition 61 has become the most expensive ballot measure battle in 2016, according to the nonpartisan politics website Ballotpedia. Led by industry lobbying group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, known as PhRMA, the opposition has raised more than $100 million for its campaign, compared to $14 million by supporters. Despite the heavy spending, the drug industry remains concerned about the proposition since two polls have found California voters leaning toward passing it. In an early September survey conducted by USC Dornsife and the Los Angeles Times, about two-thirds of participants said they would vote yes, 23 percent said no and 12 percent had no answer. A late September poll by Field Research Corp. found half inclined to vote yes, 16 percent leaning toward no and 34 percent undecided. “Nearly 200 groups including veterans, doctors, patients, taxpayers, seniors and aids/HIV groups are opposed, along with every daily newspaper in the state,” Kathy Fairbanks, spokeswoman for the No on Prop 61 Coalition, said in an e-mail. Representatives for the Aids Healthcare Foundation, which is the biggest backer of Proposition 61, didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. If the initiative passes on Nov. 8, it’s not likely to have any “fundamental impact” on drug companies, according to Michael Yee, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. The industry’s main concern is “emboldening 49 other states to look at these types of legislation to try to change prices,” Yee wrote Tuesday in a note to clients. Piper Jaffray analyst Schimmer also questions the ultimate effect of Proposition 61 if it were to pass: “Will the pharma industry really compromise profits, or simply find another way around this Act?” he wrote in an October note to clients. “The industry is wily—cost shifting, cost cutting or raising prices to the VA will be the likely end result.” Email Tweet ADVERTISEMENT Recent Articles by Bloomberg News Pence to lead Trump transition team, replacing Christie as chairman Drugmakers' stocks jump on promise of Trump presidency Global markets rocked as traders see pathway for Trump victory Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said the nearly $15 billion deal “adequately and fairly” compensates consumers and gets the polluting vehicles off the road as soon as possible. The German automaker acknowledged last year that about 475,000 Volkswagens and Audis with 2-litre, four-cylinder diesel engines were programmed to cheat on emissions tests. ___ Despite warnings, extremely dangerous air bags not repaired DETROIT (AP) — Despite thousands of mailed notices and warnings of grave danger, Honda is still having trouble finding and notifying about 300,000 people with potentially deadly air bag inflators in their cars. About 69 million Takata inflators have been recalled due to possible rupture. And in June, government regulators said testing showed that inflators in 313,000 older Hondas and Acuras had as high as a 50 per cent chance of rupturing in a crash. They told owners to stop driving them and get repairs. But four months later, only 13,000 of the cars have done so, highlighting major holes remain in the recall system. ___ New Wells Fargo CEO to employees: ‘We’re sorry’ NEW YORK (AP) — Newly appointed Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan has told employees that he is “sorry for the pain” that the bank’s employees have felt as a result of the company’s sales practices scandal. Sloan’s company-wide speech given Tuesday is the latest effort by Wells Fargo’s executives to atone for the fact that the bank’s employees, pushed by impossible sales goals, opened as many as 2 million bank and credit card accounts without customers’ authorization. In the speech, Sloan acknowledged that the bank did not respond to the problems in its branches soon enough and that upper management dodged responsibility for the bad behaviour and wrongly placed blamed on its branch employees. ___ Consumer stocks fall as Whirlpool, GM and others skid NEW YORK (AP) — Shaky results from consumer companies dragged the U.S. stock market lower on Tuesday as well-known names like appliance maker Whirlpool and athletic apparel maker Under Armour suffered their worst losses in years. Third-quarter earnings continued to dominate the market and some of the biggest companies either reported disappointing results or lowered their expectations. Investors wondered if consumers will spend less money on home improvement, clothing and other goods. But companies including Procter & Gamble and Lockheed Martin soared after their reports. Looking for safer options, some investors bought bonds and utility company shares. ___ US home prices rose in August, lifted by dwindling supply WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. home prices climbed at a solid pace in August as more home buyers competed for fewer available properties. The Standard & Poor’s CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-city home price index rose 5.1 per cent in August, after a 5 per cent gain in July. Portland, Seattle and Denver reported the strongest year-over-year increases for the seventh month in a row. Steady hiring, low mortgage rates and some early signs of rising pay have encouraged more Americans to buy homes. Yet the number of homes for sale has fallen nearly 7 per cent from a year ago. ___ Consumer confidence retreated slightly in October WASHINGTON (AP) — American consumers felt less confident this month, but the small retreat came after confidence had risen to a 20-month high in September. Consumer confidence slipped to 98.6 this month after rising to 103.5 in September, the Conference Board reported Tuesday. The September reading was the highest since confidence stood at 103.8 in January 2015. The September confidence number was revised down from an initial estimate of 104.1, which had been the highest in nine years. The lower October reading reflected a drop in consumers’ assessment of current business conditions and employment prospects. ___ Caterpillar stung by global economic funk PEORIA, Ill. (AP) — Caterpillar’s third-quarter profit was essentially cut in half with the global economy stuck in a funk, and the company said that it expects that malaise to extend into next year. The construction and mining equipment maker lowered its outlook for the year. Falling commodity prices on the farm, in the mines, and in the oil patch have forced a deep reduction in equipment spending. The earnings report Tuesday was the first since Caterpillar announced that longtime CEO Doug Oberhelman was stepping down. ___ Merck breezes past 3Q profit expectations, raises forecast Higher sales of vaccines and prescription medicines, coupled with restrained spending, helped Merck & Co. post a 20 per cent jump in third-quarter profit, trouncing Wall Street expectations. The company raised and narrowed its 2016 financial forecasts, but noted some headwinds, including the start of U.S. generic competition to three drugs by year’s end. ___ Procter & Gamble’s 1Q performance tops Street’s view CINCINNATI (AP) — Procter & Gamble Co.’s fiscal first-quarter results beat Wall Street’s expectations as it controlled expenses and saw solid sales growth in its health care segment. P&G has been working on transforming its business to better focus on bigger brands with growth potential. The company has already shed some of the smaller brands it says collectively contribute little to its operating profit. ___ Under Armour takes a breather BALTIMORE (AP) — Under Armour had one of the worst trading days in its history as investors sensed that the hard-charging athletic company may be hitting the wall. The company reported Tuesday that quarterly revenue growth was the slowest in six years and it trimmed growth projections. Chief Financial Officer Chip Molloy said that while Under Armour continues to believe that it will significantly outpace rivals, “the growth rate going forward will be less than” what was anticipated last year. ___ GM reports record 3Q earnings despite slowing US sales DETROIT (AP) — General Motors doesn’t seem too worried about slowing U.S. auto sales or economic troubles in Europe. If third-quarter numbers are any indication, the company has numbers to back that up. The Detroit automaker reported a record profit on Tuesday that doubled results in the third quarter a year ago. And the automaker put a little more swagger behind its full-year guidance, predicting pretax earnings at the high end of previous forecasts of $5.50 to $6 per share. GM earned $2.77 billion, or $1.76 per share, compared with $1.36 billion, or 84 cents per share a year ago. Revenue hit a record $42.8 billion. ___ Chipotles sales fall again as it tries to win back customers NEW YORK (AP) — Chipotle says its sales fell for the fifth straight quarter, as the company struggles to win back customers after an E. coli scare last year. The burrito chain says sales fell 21.9 per cent at established restaurants during the quarter ending Sept. 30. That’s worse than the 18.3 per cent drop Wall Street analysts expected, according to FactSet. The company has given out millions of free burritos and launched a three-month loyalty program in June to try to bring customers back. In September, it offered even more freebies: Kids could eat free on Sundays and students could grab free sodas or iced tea with their meals. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average sank 53.76 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 18,169.27. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index gave up 8.17 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 2,143.16. The Nasdaq composite slid 26.43 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 5,283.40. Benchmark U.S. crude lost 56 cents, or 1.1 per cent, to $49.96 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 67 cents, or 1.3 per cent, to $50.79 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline stayed at $1.50 a gallon. Heating oil lost 2 cent to $1.56 a gallon. Natural gas sank 6 cent, or 2 per cent, to $2.77 per 1,000 cubic feet. shares Share: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Share Email Advertisement Advertisement    Leave a comment Hide comments Leave a comment Cancel reply Sign in to comment.

Stocks close lower on mixed earnings results USA TODAY 10/25/2016 Adam Shell Click to expand Replay Video Bond market reels over $1 trillion loss from 'Trump thump' Donald Trump's shocking victory for the White House may end the more than 30-year-old bull run in bonds. According to Reuters, that's because bets on faster U.S. growth and inflation are leading investors to favor stocks over bonds. A two-day thumping wiped out more than $1 trillion across global bond markets worldwide, on bets that plans under a Trump administration would boost business investments and spending while firing up inflation. It was the worst rout in nearly 1-1/2 years.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 54 points, or 0.3%, to close at 18,169. The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index fell 0.4% to 2143 and the Nasdaq composite was 0.5% lower to 5283. Quotes in the article Procter & Gamble Co PG ▼ 83.00 -0.58 -0.69% Caterpillar Inc CAT ▲ 94.17 +1.16 +1.25% United Technologies Corp UTX ▼ 107.86 -1.00 -0.92% Merck KGaA MKGAF ▼ 102.25 -0.22 -0.21% Wall Street got a large slate of earnings reports from Dow components, including well-received reports from P&G (PG), which reported organic growth of 3%, as well as United Technologies (UTX), and drug maker Merck (MRK), which topped forecast with the help of strong sales of its cancer drug Keytruda. But the good news was offset by weaker-than-expected results from companies like 3M (MMM) and Caterpillar (CAT), which cut its earnings view for the remainder of 2016, citing sluggish sales of its heavy equipment. P&G shares rose 3.4%. Merck's stock rose 2%. And United Technologies shares jumped 1.9%. Caterpillar fell 1.8% and 3M fell 3%. Shares of Dow component and chemical giant DuPont (DD) fell 0.7% despite topping profit and sales forecast and boosting its full-year 2016 earnings outlook. 3M shares fell 3% and Caterpillar's stock was unchanged. Caterpillar's outgoing CEO Doug Oberhelman, who is retiring later this year, painted a gloomy picture of the global economy, noting that "economic weakness throughout much of the world persists," in a press release containing the company's earnings results. With the presidential election now two weeks away, investors are also bracing for the homestretch of the campaign and gearing up for any potential surprises. Stocks have held up nicely in recent sessions as the third-quarter earnings season has gotten off to a better-than-expected start. Earnings growth for the July-thru-September quarter is above 1% currently, which has raised hopes that the quarterly streak of contracting earnings growth will end at four. In economic news, consumer confidence fell more than expected in October, according to the Conference Board. But data on the U.S. housing market remained solid. The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. home price index rose 0.2% in August and another index that tracks purchase prices saw an uptick of 0.7% in August, according to FHFA. iPhone maker Apple reported its quarterly profit results after today's closing bell.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermidMore By Hilary Russ NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on disappointing earnings reports on Tuesday, while the U.S. dollar slipped from multi-month highs after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney cast doubt on expectations for more monetary stimulus. Oil prices fell more than 1 percent, with U.S. crude breaking below $50 per barrel for a second straight day, ahead of weekly data that could show a build in inventories. On Wall Street, nine of the eleven sectors in the benchmark S&P 500 stock index closed lower, with housing and consumer products companies among those failing to live up to forecasts on third-quarter earnings. Shares of some big names, including Whirlpool , General Motors Co , Caterpillar Inc and 3M , all lost ground. "We had a rally (Monday) and haven't been able to sustain it, due to weaker-than-expected numbers from some names," said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois. He called the day's earnings report a "mixed bag" for stocks. Another third of the S&P 500 is scheduled to report earnings this week, including heavyweights Apple , Alphabet , Amazon and Boeing . The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 8.17 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,143.16 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> dropped 26.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. The dollar was a hair lower against a basket of major currencies <.DXY> after touching an eight-month high. Growing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in December had boosted the dollar to its highest level in more than seven months against the euro and about three months against the yen. When BoE policymakers meet next week to consider whether to cut interest rates, they will "undoubtedly" take sterling's weakness into account, BoE Governor Mark Carney told lawmakers on Tuesday. "Carney's comments cast doubt on easing from Europe," said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York. Sterling slumped to its lowest level since the Oct. 7 "flash crash" but recovered some of its losses on Carney's remarks. The pound was last down 0.47 percent. In European stocks, mining companies <.SXPP> rose 3.2 percent, lifted in part by Anglo American , up 4.55 percent after its production update. Anglo is the top-performing stock on Europe's STOXX 600 <.STOXX> this year. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index <.FTSE> extended gains, closing up 0.45 percent. Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> turned slightly lower, ending down 0.04 percent, after hitting its highest level of the year. The closely-watched Ifo survey beat expectations, a day after purchasing manager numbers had done the same. Metal prices surged, with zinc up 2.37 percent at $2,366.85, but off an earlier three-week high of $2,376. It is up nearly 60 percent from January lows on worries about shortages. Other commodity prices slipped, though, as many are priced in U.S. dollars. U.S. crude oil futures settled 56 cents lower at $49.96 per barrel, down 1.11 percent.

"Following" : "Follow"}} October 25, 2016 11:52am   Comments Share: It’s an epic earnings day on Wall Street, as a collection of massive U.S. companies report results, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and five other Dow components. Fed speakers and housing data help round out the schedule. Earnings just keep rumbling on here as we near the end of October, and so far, there’s been little not to like. To date, more than 75% of companies have beat expectations, and, in a truly positive sign, nearly 80% have beaten Wall Street’s consensus estimates on the revenue side of the coin. Futures trading pointed toward a slightly higher open. Approximately 180 S&P 500 companies report results this week, and it seems like a big portion of them come today. Among the big names are Merck & Co., Inc (NYSE: MRK), Eli Lilly and Co (NYSE: LLY), 3M Co (NYSE: MMM), and E I Du Pont De Nemours And Co (NYSE: DD). And waiting in the wings is Apple, which reports after the close (see below). Expect the flavor of the market this week to mostly be shaped by individual company earnings stories, and remember, there’s still a lot to come after today, with names like Boeing Co (NYSE: BA), The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO), Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) on tap in the coming days. By the end of the week, investors should have pretty good insight into the health of big U.S. companies. Earlier today, another biggie reported, as Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) surpassed earnings per share estimates but didn’t match Wall Street analysts’ estimates on revenue. The company also lowered its full-year guidance, and, in a statement, cited “economic weakness throughout the world.” But MRK shares zoomed up 3% early Tuesday after the company solidly beat on earnings and revenue. 3M, Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG) and DD also beat estimates. Bond prices remain under pressure, in part from solid U.S. economic data, and the yield on U.S. 10-year Treasury bonds is back above 1.75%. It’s also noteworthy that the yield curve is on its way up, meaning the spread between short-term and longer-term yields is increasing. This can be a positive factor for the financial sector, and sure enough, financials are up nearly 2% over the last week, solidly ahead of the broader market. Consumer confidence reached nine-year highs last month, and we’ll find out if that lasted into October when the Conference Board reports at 10 a.m. ET today. Perhaps a better measure of consumer confidence is durable goods data, due Thursday morning. And the Case-Shiller 20-city housing index and the FHFA Housing Index, both out this morning, might also provide more insight into the consumer economy. Atlanta Federal Reserve President Dennis Lockhart speaks this afternoon. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans made some dovish remarks on Monday about potentially keeping the federal funds rate lower for longer. M&A Volume Scampering Up: Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity is picking up here in Q4, with the biggest recent deal the $85 billion agreement for AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) to purchase Time Warner Inc (NYSE: TWX). That was just one of a few recent deals totaling nearly $240 billion that have a chance to make 2016 the second-biggest M&A year on record after 2015 if just a handful of the current deals come to fruition, Bloomberg noted. M&A activity became rather sluggish in the wake of the Great Recession, falling well over 50% on a value basis between 2007 and 2009 before waking up and slowly growing until the record activity of last year. A relatively slow-growing economy that makes it hard for companies to out-perform, combined with low interest rates that provide easy access to financing, often can make M&A seem more attractive. On the other hand, the agreement between T and TWX appears to face a challenging regulatory scrutiny, and politicians from both major parties expressed concern that the deal could concentrate too much power in too few hands. We’ll see what ultimately gets done with this one. Are Samsung’s Struggles Handing AAPL a Bigger Slice of Market? As anyone who’s been on an airplane flight recently probably knows, airlines have banned Samsung’s Galaxy 7 phone because it might be a fire hazard, and the phone has been recalled. Did this steer additional customers to Apple, which reports earnings after the close today? That’s one thing to keep an eye on, and investors might also be curious to see how AAPL’s new iPhone 7 did during its first months on the market. Though the iPhone 7 and Samsung’s struggles could take the headlines, it’s also worth watching to see if AAPL continues to see falling sales overall, as it has the last two quarters. The phone market keeps getting tougher, and in Q2, AAPL’s sales fell 15% from a year earlier, the second quarter in a row of falling sales. For Q3, analysts surveyed by Briefing.com expect earnings per share of $1.65, down from $1.96 a year ago, but the company’s share price remains near its high for the year. Going Opposite Ways? Stocks were tracking crude oil rather closely last week, but the relationship appeared to break down a little on Monday, as the S&P 500 Index (Index: SPX) rose nearly 0.5% while front-month U.S. crude futures fell around the same amount, dipping below $50 a barrel during the session before recovering slightly. Pressure on oil came from the fundamental side, as Iraq said it wouldn’t necessarily abide by an OPEC output freeze. But later in the day, Iran said it would encourage other countries to join. Oil futures have been trading back and forth near the $50 level for several weeks, perhaps a sign of how difficult it is to pierce this mark. Last week saw 11 new oil rigs added to U.S. production, according to the Baker Hughes weekly report, if anyone needed a reminder that higher prices often lead to more U.S. drilling, which can lead to lower prices.   TD Ameritrade and all third parties mentioned are separate and unaffiliated companies, and are not responsible for each other’s policies or services.

Wall Street was set to tick higher with consumer confidence figures due and analysts already tucking into healthy-looking earnings from Procter & Gamble, General Motors and drugs giant Merck, but also a profit downgrade from Caterpillar. Europe had been cheered as Germany's Dax hit its highest level of the year after the closely-watched Ifo survey beat expectations a day after purchasing manager numbers had done the same. The region's mining firms were the standout performers though. They hit a 14-month top as zinc surged to a five-year peak and iron ore reached its highest since mid-2014, all of which should pick up the pulse of inflation globally. "We are seeing a pick-up of economic activity against the backdrop of only one central bank - the Fed - that is likely to tighten policy and that is supporting asset markets," said CMC Markets senior analyst Michael Hewson. In foreign exchange markets, the dollar took a breather having reached its highest since early February against other top currencies as traders continued to add to the bets on a December U.S. interest rate rise <_0FF:_>. China's yuan went the other way, hitting its lowest since "offshore" trading was introduced in 2010 as Beijing nudged down official rates again. It traded as soft as 6.7882 yuan per dollar. The currency's fall of more than 1.5 percent since the end of September has stirred renewed suspicion of a possible extended slide in the yuan, even though officials have reiterated their expectations for a stable currency. But the weakness has revived memories of a shock yuan devaluation last August and another rapid depreciation early this year - falls that triggered a bout of global market turmoil. Analysts pointed out, however, that during this round of yuan weakness, global risk sentiment was holding up. "That highlights the extent to which dollar gains are unlikely to be as extended as they were (in the past)," said BNP Paribas currency strategist Sam Lynton-Brown, in London. GOLDEN MINERS The cheer around the mining sector was increased further as a production update thrust London-listed giant Anglo American's shares up over 3 percent to take their gains this year to almost 270 percent. The staggering rise has made Anglo the top performing stock on Europe's STOXX 600 this year. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei rose 0.7 percent to close at a six-month high as a softening yen burnished the outlook for the country's exporters. Australian stocks added 0.6 percent and Taiwan 0.7 percent. Wall Street was taking encouragement from upbeat corporate results. Over one third of U.S. companies have now reported and 80 percent have beaten market expectations. Another third of the S&P 500 components are scheduled to report earnings later this week, including heavyweights Apple , Alphabet, Amazon and Boeing. Merger and acquisition activity added extra fizz in the wake of AT&T Inc's $85.4 billion bid for Time Warner Inc , though the deal seemed destined to face stringent scrutiny from regulators. Safe-haven bonds were feeling the strain of the bullish mood elsewhere with U.S. Treasury yields up to almost 1.78 percent again and European yields creeping higher. In commodities, oil prices briefly dipped on news of the impending restart of Britain's Buzzard oilfield and Iraq's wish to be exempted from OPEC production cuts. Brent was down 5 cents at $51.41 a barrel, while U.S. crude hovered at $50.50. But going the other way were metals with zinc, nickel, copper and tin all shining and Chinese iron ore futures reaching their highest since August 2014. Coal prices also reached new peaks after weeks of gains, a prop for the Australian dollar as the two commodities are the country's biggest export earners. Another mover was the Canadian dollar which rebounded from a seven-month low after Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said the decision on whether to cut interest rates again was not one to take lightly. The comments countered recent speculation about an imminent easing and nudged the U.S. dollar down to C$1.3333 from a peak at C$1.3398.

Home Mail News Sport Finance Celebrity Style Weather Answers Flickr Mobile More Yahoo Search Search Mail News Home Follow us UK Yahoo Originals World Finance Sport Motoring Science & Tech Celebrity TV Movies Style Weather News Video Viral U.S. stocks slip on earnings, dollar off highs By Hilary Russ25 October 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Share View photos Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., October 25, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermidMore By Hilary Russ NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on disappointing earnings reports on Tuesday, while the U.S. dollar slipped from multi-month highs after Chancellor Governor Mark Carney cast doubt on expectations for more monetary stimulus. Oil prices fell more than 1 percent, with U.S. crude breaking below $50 per barrel for a second straight day, ahead of weekly data that could show a build in inventories. On Wall Street, nine of the eleven sectors in the benchmark S&P 500 stock index closed lower, with housing and consumer products companies among those failing to live up to forecasts on third-quarter earnings. Shares of some big names, including Whirlpool, General Motors Co, Caterpillar Inc and 3M, all lost ground. "We had a rally (Monday) and haven't been able to sustain it, due to weaker-than-expected numbers from some names," said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois. He called the day's earnings report a "mixed bag" for stocks. Another third of the S&P 500 is scheduled to report earnings this week, including heavyweights Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Boeing. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27, the S&P 500 lost 8.17 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,143.16 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 26.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. The dollar was a hair lower against a basket of major currencies after touching an eight-month high. Growing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in December had boosted the dollar to its highest level in more than seven months against the euro and about three months against the yen. When BoE policymakers meet next week to consider whether to cut interest rates, they will "undoubtedly" take sterling's weakness into account, BoE Governor Mark Carney told lawmakers on Tuesday. "Carney's comments cast doubt on easing from Europe," said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York. Sterling slumped to its lowest level since the Oct. 7 "flash crash" but recovered some of its losses on Carney's remarks. The pound was last down 0.47 percent. In European stocks, mining companies rose 3.2 percent, lifted in part by Anglo American, up 4.55 percent after its production update. Anglo is the top-performing stock on Europe's STOXX 600 this year. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index extended gains, closing up 0.45 percent. Germany's DAX turned slightly lower, ending down 0.04 percent, after hitting its highest level of the year. The closely-watched Ifo survey beat expectations, a day after purchasing manager numbers had done the same. Metal prices surged, with zinc up 2.37 percent at $2,366.85, but off an earlier three-week high of $2,376. It is up nearly 60 percent from January lows on worries about shortages. Other commodity prices slipped, though, as many are priced in U.S. dollars. U.S. crude oil futures settled 56 cents lower at $49.96 per barrel, down 1.11 percent.

Mon, Nov 14, 2016, 23:37 GMT - UK Markets closed GLOBAL MARKETS-Stocks, commodities climb as economic confidence risesReuters - UK Focus – Tue, Oct 25, 2016 13:20 BST Share 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print Companies: Merck KGaA BNP Paribas SA Anglo American plc RELATED QUOTES Symbol Price Change 0O14.L 88.095 -1.720 BNP.PA 55.66 +0.91 AAL.L 1,175.00 +26.50 6549.TWO 22.10 +1.10 AAPL.SW 107.00 0.00 * Europe pushes higher as DAX hits year to date high * US dollar supported after solid manufacturing survey * Wall St expected to tick higher on upbeat earnings, M&A frenzy * Oil drifts lower but steel, industrial commodities on the rise By Marc Jones LONDON, Oct (Shenzhen: 000069.SZ - news) 25 (Reuters) - World markets (Xetra: 4WM.DE - news) had a swagger about them on Tuesday as upbeat economic data and signs of a revival in inflation pushed up stocks and commodity prices and kept the dollar at a nine-month high. Wall Street was set to tick higher with consumer confidence figures due and analysts already tucking into healthy-looking earnings from Procter & Gamble, General Motors (NYSE: GM - news) and drugs giant Merck (LSE: 0O14.L - news) , but also a profit downgrade from Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT - news) . Europe had been cheered as Germany's Dax hit its highest level of the year after the closely-watched Ifo survey beat expectations a day after purchasing manager numbers had done the same. The region's mining firms were the standout performers though. They hit a 14-month top as zinc surged to a five-year peak and iron ore reached its highest since mid-2014, all of which should pick up the pulse of inflation globally. "We are seeing a pick-up of economic activity against the backdrop of only one central bank - the Fed - that is likely to tighten policy and that is supporting asset markets," said CMC (Shanghai: 600327.SS - news) Markets senior analyst Michael Hewson. In foreign exchange markets, the dollar took a breather having reached its highest since early February against other top currencies as traders continued to add to the bets on a December U.S. interest rate rise . China's yuan went the other way, hitting its lowest since "offshore" trading was introduced in 2010 as Beijing nudged down official rates again. It traded as soft as 6.7882 yuan per dollar. The currency's fall of more than 1.5 percent since the end of September has stirred renewed suspicion of a possible extended slide in the yuan, even though officials have reiterated their expectations for a stable currency. But the weakness has revived memories of a shock yuan devaluation last August and another rapid depreciation early this year - falls that triggered a bout of global market turmoil. Analysts pointed out, however, that during this round of yuan weakness, global risk sentiment was holding up. "That highlights the extent to which dollar gains are unlikely to be as extended as they were (in the past)," said BNP (Paris: FR0000131104 - news) Paribas currency strategist Sam Lynton-Brown, in London. GOLDEN MINERS The cheer around the mining sector was increased further as a production update thrust London-listed giant Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news) 's shares up over 3 percent to take their gains this year to almost 270 percent. The staggering rise has made Anglo the top performing stock on Europe's STOXX 600 this year. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei rose 0.7 percent to close at a six-month high as a softening yen burnished the outlook for the country's exporters. Australian stocks added 0.6 percent and Taiwan (Taiwan OTC: 6549.TWO - news) 0.7 percent. Wall Street was taking encouragement from upbeat corporate results. Over one third of U.S. companies have now reported and 80 percent have beaten market expectations. Another third of the S&P 500 components are scheduled to report earnings later this week, including heavyweights Apple (Swiss: AAPL.SW - news) , Alphabet (Xetra: ABEA.DE - news) , Amazon and Boeing (NYSE: BA - news) . Merger and acquisition activity added extra fizz in the wake of AT&T Inc (Sao Paolo: ATTB34F.SA - news) 's $85.4 billion bid for Time Warner Inc (Xetra: AOL1.DE - news) , though the deal seemed destined to face stringent scrutiny from regulators. Safe-haven bonds were feeling the strain of the bullish mood elsewhere with U.S. Treasury yields up to almost 1.78 percent again and European yields creeping higher. In commodities, oil prices briefly dipped on news of the impending restart of Britain's Buzzard oilfield and Iraq's wish to be exempted from OPEC production cuts. Brent was down 5 cents at $51.41 a barrel, while U.S. crude hovered at $50.50. But going the other way were metals with zinc, nickel, copper and tin all shining and Chinese iron ore futures reaching their highest since August 2014. Coal prices also reached new peaks after weeks of gains, a prop for the Australian dollar as the two commodities are the country's biggest export earners. Another mover was the Canadian dollar which rebounded from a seven-month low after Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said the decision on whether to cut interest rates again was not one to take lightly. The comments countered recent speculation about an imminent easing and nudged the U.S. dollar down to C$1.3333 from a peak at C$1.3398.

JOHNSON, AP Medical Writer Updated: Oct 25, 2016 - 11:38 AM Twtter KENILWORTH, N.J. - Higher sales of vaccines and prescription medicines, coupled with restrained spending, helped Merck & Co. post a 20 percent jump in third-quarter profit, trouncing Wall Street expectations. The maker of Januvia diabetes pills raised and narrowed its 2016 financial forecasts, but noted some headwinds, including the start of U.S. generic competition to three drugs by year's end. Its shares edged higher in midday trading Tuesday. The second-biggest U.S. drugmaker is in transition, with revenue from older products such as immune disorder treatment Remicade and the Dulera asthma inhaler leveling off or falling amid increased competition. But sales are building for drugs launched since 2014, particularly immuno-oncology drug Keytruda and hepatitis C-curing Zepatier. Meanwhile, Zinplava for preventing recurrence of life-threatening C. difficile infections was approved Friday in the U.S., and Merck plans to apply soon for approval of experimental diabetes drug ertugliflozin and additional uses for Keytruda, its newest blockbuster, with more than $1 billion in sales over the past four quarters. In addition, chief executive Ken Frazier told analysts during a conference call that deals to boost Merck's pipeline of experimental drugs, with a focus on small -to-midsized assets that fit well within its business, are a priority. He noted Merck is calling attention to the innovation of its medicines amid the U.S. political furor over soaring drug prices. "We don't think these environmental pricing pressures will ease," Frazier said. Merck reported net income of $2.18 billion, or 78 cents per share. Adjusted for one-time gains and costs, earnings came to $1.07 per share, eclipsing the 98 cents analysts expected. The Kenilworth, New Jersey-based drugmaker reported revenue of $10.54 billion, up 5 percent and above Street forecasts for $10.24 billion. Sales of prescription drugs rose 6 percent to $9.44 billion, led by higher sales for Keytruda, cholesterol pill Zetia, drugs used in hospitals and Gardasil and other vaccines. Top seller Januvia and combination drug Jamumet, for Type 2 diabetes, saw sales dip 1 percent to a combined $1.56 billion. Sales of cholesterol medicines Zetia and Vytorin, which should face generic competition by year's end, edged up 1 percent to $944 million. Antibiotic Cubicin also is getting generic competition this quarter. Gardasil, a vaccine against cancer-causing human papilloma virus, saw sales jump 38 percent to $860 million, boosted by a higher U.S. price for a new version that protects against more strains of HPV, higher U.S. demand and purchases by government health programs. Children's vaccine Proquad also benefited from U.S. health program stockpiling, raising sales 28 percent to $496 million. Keytruda, one of the hot new cancer drugs that work by boosting the immune system to fight tumors, posted sales of $364 million, up 124 percent. Late Monday, the immuno-oncology drug won U.S. approval - two months ahead of schedule - for using Keytruda in bigger patient groups, including those newly diagnosed with lung cancer. Cancer drugs typically are approved initially for use after multiple other drugs have failed patients, then gradually allowed to be used earlier in treatment. Keytruda is already approved as a second-line treatment for lung cancer and for melanoma and head and neck cancer. It's being tested in about 300 patient studies, alone and combined with chemotherapy or other immuno-oncology drugs. "We are excited by the long-term potential of Keytruda against many different tumor types," pharmaceutical marketing head Adam Schechter told the analysts. Sanford Bernstein analyst Dr. Timothy Anderson wrote to investors that the early approval "helps cement the product's lead versus competitors in the large lung cancer market," which should further raise Keytruda sales. Sales of veterinary medicines rose 5 percent to $865 million, driven partly by the Bravecto line of flea and tick products. Merck now expects full-year earnings of $2.02 to $2.09, up from its July forecast of $1.98 to $2.08, and revenue of $39.7 billion to $40.2 billion, up from $39.1 billion to $40.1 billion. In midday trading, Merck shares rose 74 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $61.49 as the broader markets declined. Merck shares have risen more than 16 percent over the past year. _____ Follow Linda A.

The vaccine is thought to be one of the brightest spots in GSK's near-term pipeline, with clinical data showing it is more effective in preventing shingles in older people than Merck & Co's older vaccine Zostavax. Shingles is a painful infection caused by varicella zoster virus (VZV), the chickenpox virus. While the immune system can generally shake off the symptoms of chickenpox, the virus lies dormant and if a person becomes immune-suppressed can reawaken, resulting in painful skin lesions. It is increasingly common with advancing age. GSK is hoping that Shingrix' efficacy profile means it will meet and exceed sales of Zostavax, which brought in $750m for Merck last year. Last month, the UK pharma group reported clinical data showing that Shingrix had 90% efficacy in elderly patients, with the vaccine still providing protection four years after it was administered. In contrast, Zostavax' efficacy is generally between 18% and 70% and is known to decline in older people. GSK is hoping that increased efficacy means it will be favoured ahead of Zostavax and also drive up vaccination rates against shingles, which remain relatively low. "Shingles is a common and potentially serious condition [and] can cause lasting pain and other complications such as scarring or visual impairment," said GSK's head of vaccines R&D Dr Emmanuel Hanon. "The risk of developing shingles increases with age and it is estimated that up to one in every three people is at risk." GSK needs Shingrix and other new products in its pipeline to deliver as it copes with increased competition in its respiratory business and the loss of patent protection for blockbuster asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) drug Seretide/Advair (salmeterol and fluticasone propionate). Other important new products for the company include interleukin-5 inhibitor Nucala (mepolizumab) for severe asthma, sirukumab for rheumatoid arthritis, daprodustat for anaemia and HIV drug cabotegravir, a new product cycle that GSK says will add £6bn to its revenues by 2020.

X Department of Health urges parents to ensure their daughters receive the HPV cervical cancer vaccine Use of the vaccine ‘could eliminate nearly 90 cervical cancer deaths a year and the need for 280 women a year to undergo treatment for the disease’ Tue, Oct 25, 2016, 12:00 Dick Ahlstrom A girl getting vaccinated against HPV. Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty Images         Sometimes a decision really is a matter of life or death. Deciding whether your child should take a vaccine is just such a decision, one that can have a profound impact on their lives. People are familiar with the controversy over the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. A vaccination programme was bringing the measles infection rate down sharply until a UK scientist claimed the vaccine was linked to autism. This happened in 1998 and although the research later proved to have been falsified, too many parents still resist MMR vaccination nearly 20 years later, leading to unnecessary deaths. History now seems to be repeating itself, as the number of parents allowing their young teenage daughters to be vaccinated against cervical cancer declines. The human papillomavirus or HPV is a known cancer-causing agent that accounts for virtually all of the cervical cancer cases that occur here, according to Dr Robert O’Connor, head of research at the Irish Cancer Society. Full use of the vaccine could eliminate nearly 90 cervical cancer deaths a year and the need for 280 women a year to undergo treatment for the disease. The vaccine used here is Gardasil produced by Merck. There is a similar vaccine Cervarix sold by GlaxoSmithKline. “We had a very successful HPV vaccination programme launched in 2010 and with an immunisation target of 80 per cent,” says Dr Brenda Corcoran, a consultant in public health medicine and the head of the HSE’s National Immunisation Office. “We increased uptake to 87 per cent during the 2014-15 campaign. Everything was going very well and parents were consenting to their children getting the vaccine. Then, about 2015, uptake started to decline and we were getting more refusals. The final figures aren’t out but they are unlikely to change from an estimated 70 per cent.” The sudden fall has caused great concern among Irish health officials given the direct link between cancer risk and vaccination. ADVERTISEMENT The World Health Organisation also expressed its concern, asking Ireland to attend a meeting in Copenhagen where it was to discuss falling vaccine uptake figures being seen in Denmark. HPV vaccination would have brought Ireland quickly back into line but that is now jeopardised by concerns over safety being raised by groups opposed to the use of the vaccine. “Groups were set up, Regret (Reaction and Effects of Gardasil Resulting in Extreme Trauma) and Irish Vaccination Awareness, both of which have concerns the vaccine causes problems for some girls,” she says. Regret has a list of more than 400 girls it says were harmed as a side effect of Gardasil. It claims the girls suffer from chronic fatigue, lethargy, autoimmune diseases, fibromyalgia and other conditions as a consequence of vaccination. Many of these conditions however are common in adolescence and are much more common at this age than in later years, Dr Corcoran says. “There have been many studies done on this. All the studies have shown the rates of these conditions in vaccinated girls is the same as in unvaccinated girls,” she says. The groups have no evidence to back up what they claim. “Certainly it is not caused by the vaccine.” Dr O’Connor concurs. “These conditions were described 100 years ago,” he says. “Unfortunately parents go on line and put in symptoms and this raises concerns about the vaccine. There is no causative association, as shown by numerous studies.” Even so more than 400 families believe the vaccine harmed their children. “We are a voluntary support group of parents. We are not anti-vaccination as we are sometimes portrayed,” says Anna Cannon, spokeswoman for Regret. The group lacks hard scientific evidence that Gardasil was the cause, but the conditions developed by the children are very real to them and their parents. “We are not out to wreck the vaccination programme, we are parents concerned about our children.” She is urging the HSE to include a full patient information leaflet in the materials given to parents. She is also asking that the HSE assess these children in case there is some unknown risk with the vaccine. “We are looking for an independent investigation of this group of girls whatever the outcome. If the vaccine impacted their health we need to establish how we can restore their health. That is a fair request,” Ms Cannon says. “We are not asking them to take the vaccine off the market.” The Department of Health continues to promote the vaccine given it reduces cancers in later life. Some have “unsubstantiated concerns” about the safety of the HPV vaccine but these have “no scientific basis”, it says. It urges parents to ensure their daughters receive the vaccine. ‘MMR is a life-saving vaccine, so too is HPV’ The use of any vaccine comes with a small risk that there will be side effects. The question is whether these risks are outweighed by the benefits of vaccination. The risks may also include death but sometimes the risks are worth taking. Polio infection can cause various degrees of paralysis and also death. Three in one million children given the polio vaccine will develop paralysis but without vaccination one in 200 children who are infected will become paralysed. Many parents blocked the MMR vaccine for their children due to health fears later proven to be false. The scare in 1998 led to a measles outbreak in Dublin in 2000 involving 1,600 cases. Three of these children died because they had not received the vaccination. The HPV vaccine also causes side effects. One in eight girls may faint a short time after the injection, a common problem when vaccinating teenage girls, says Dr Brenda Corcoran of the HSE. ADVERTISEMENT One in 10 girls will get pain or redness at the injection site. One in 100 might feel nauseous or run a temperature and one in 10,000 might develop a skin rash. The risk of a severe allergic reaction is a one in a million chance, making this a very safe vaccine. There has been constant study of these side effects since the vaccine came into use a decade ago, including by the World Health Organisation, the European Medicines Agency and the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 200 million doses have been given and the side effects seen are the same as those seen when subjects are given a placebo vaccine. Dr Robert O’Connor of the Irish Cancer Society says HPV vaccine numbers have fallen because of undue fears. “It is like the MMR situation. MMR is a life saving vaccine.” And so too is HPV, he says.       Topics: Gardasil human papillomavirus or HPV Department of Health European Medicines Agency Irish Cancer Society World Health Organisation hard scientific evidence GSK Merck More from The Irish Times Health Hospital doctors threaten strike action as pay talks collapse Opinion Picking over the past in Northern Ireland is a waste of time and money English Soccer Bastian Schweinsteiger begins talks over move to Chicago Business Sensors help police curb gang violence in Cape Town ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Maths week quiz Good at maths?

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Big Pharma Focus on Building Patent Portfolio to Gain Competitive Edge in Biologics Sector For complimentary access to more information on this research, please visit: http://corpcom.frost.com/forms/EU_PR_JSchoneborn_D6AE_Oct16 “Big pharma that are keen to stay ahead of the curve have harnessed the rapid improvements in the field of biotechnology and genomics, and rolled out biologics-based drugs,” finds TechVision Senior Consultant Manmohan Singh. “Key merger and acquisition deals such as Roche-Genentech and Sanofi-Genzyme were largely driven by companies’ vision of building complementary capabilities in the area of biologics.” Roche, GlaxoSmithKline and Merck & Co. are the top three patent holders. Antibodies, peptides and vaccines are the top three biologics types, while the top three therapeutic areas experiencing the highest patent activity are oncology, infectious diseases and immunological disorders. “Yet, as biologics have proved safer and more efficient than small molecules, major pharmaceutical companies are investing greater resources in the R&D of large molecule products,” notes Singh. “With biosimilars, or follow-on biologics, production is based on reference biologics after the patents for these biologics expire.” About TechVision Frost & Sullivan’s global TechVision practice is focused on innovation, disruption and convergence, and provides a variety of technology-based alerts, newsletters and research services as well as growth consulting services.

Notably, scientists are knocking on the door of degenerative brain disorders, though sellable answers to their questions remain years away. In the wake of diagnostic innovations and a spike in the understanding of genetic sequencing, drug developers have inched closer to discovering disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease and other neurological conditions. New approaches bring with them the promises of early detection, personalized medicine, and disease modification.

And Will Reese, co-president and chief innovation officer at Cadient, identifies a trio of other motivating factors: emerging scientific approaches bearing new opportunities, the U.S. healthcare system demanding more efficacious and economically sound solutions, and an aging population driving the costs for care. Lee Fraser, Digitas Health LifeBrands SVP and group director, says companies feel secure in their decision to forge ahead. “Better scientific rationale and basic understanding of disease etiology can mitigate the traditional high risk and low reward in this category,” he explains. But it's not all about big pharma this time. Specialty companies, including Biogen, UCB, Sage Therapeutics, and Axovant Sciences, are all elbowing for a spot in the drug-development mix. “Much of big pharma has deprioritized CNS as development risks often exceed other therapeutic areas,” Sandberg Orne notes. INFORMED BY ONCOLOGY The neurology sector has also beefed up its brainpower, taking cues from the successes of other therapeutic categories — especially oncology and cardiology.

Fox Foundation uses Facebook to recruit Ashkenazi Jews for Parkinson's study Along those lines, AbelsonTaylor VP and account director Eric Densmore believes the use of biomarkers to customize treatments will continue to surge. In addition to discovering biomarkers inside the human body, such as protein levels and axonal damage, companies are creating technologies to identify biomarkers outside the body. According to Densmore, examples include smartphone apps that can detect abnormalities in the gait of a patient with Parkinson's disease. Researchers are also upping their investment in gene-based treatments for CNS disorders. While gene therapy has been around for years, interest has surged primarily due to safer gene-delivery methods. “Biology has become clearer in the past 10 to 15 years, giving us a better idea of when and how to intervene to slow the disease progression and, hopefully one day, prevent these conditions,” says Voyager Therapeutics CEO and president Steven Paul, MD. Voyager's Phase Ib study is investigating VY-AADC01's ability to replace aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), the enzyme lacking in the neurons of patients with Parkinson's that converts levodopa into dopamine. Entering a space on the heels of several gene-therapy failures, Voyager might have its work cut out for it. But Paul believes his company is barking up a different tree. “We're not trying to repair the brain or get neurons to grow back,” he explains. Rather, the methodology involves injecting viruses carrying the AADC gene into brain regions that don't normally make dopamine. Because scientists have yet to devise a drug that addresses the underlying cause of the age-related neurodegenerative disorder, approved Parkinson's drugs such as Merck's Sinemet (carbidopa and levodopa) and UCB's Neupro (rotigotine) are meant to counteract the loss of dopamine-producing brain cells. Companies like Denali Therapeutics — which recently snagged an exclusive worldwide license to develop and sell Roche/Genentech's leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) inhibitors — are dreaming big on the Parkinson's front. Cynapsus Therapeutics, acquired by Sunovion Pharmaceuticals for $624 million, recently claimed FDA fast-track status for Parkinson's treatment APL-130277. ALZHEIMER's BRAIN BARRIERS Two competing theories to explain the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease — amyloid beta plaques and tau tangles — have driven pharma investment for years. Diagnostics progress is under way, Reese explains, especially in the development of new ways to visualize amyloid plaques to better MRI contrast agents. Biogen's aducanumab is attracting attention for its work in eliminating the amy­loid proteins responsible for damaging brain cells in patients with early-stage Alzheimer's. The experimental drug, recently granted fast-track designation by the FDA, must overcome reports of fluid buildup and bleeding in the brain. According to Sandberg Orne, the recent revelation that drugs can't undo damage already inflicted on the brain has spurred new trial designs and positive results. See also: Avanir marketing chief on selling first-in-class therapies “We're getting closer,” she says. “But the eventual approach to curing the disease will likely involve early intervention with a multi­pronged approach.” So to that end, Eli Lilly/AstraZeneca's oral BACE inhibitor AZD3293 has received fast-track status and Merck's BACE inhibitor MK-8931 has entered Phase III trials. Lilly continues to explore other mechanisms for stamping out Alzheimer's via solanezumab, which entered Phase III studies with a renewed approach following two trial flops. Industry analysts believe the first drug developer to crack the challenging Alzheimer's market will reap the rewards of commercial success — potentially billions of dollars in sales. Still, a long road lies ahead. In the meantime, market mainstays — Pfizer's Aricept (donepezil), Allergan's Namenda (memantine HCI), and Novartis' Exelon (rivastigmine) — will continue to help patients manage symptoms. [Click for a larger version of the chart.] GAINING TRACTION The $20 billion multiple sclerosis drug market is still in search of a treatment for primary pro­gressive MS. Many believe Roche's ocrelizumab may be the drug to fill that gap. Despite a few safety snags in 2015, Biogen handily leads the MS market with ­Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) for relapsing forms of MS. Some analysts expect its 2016 sales to grow 45.5% to $4.2 billion. Factor in the company's blockbusters Tysabri (natalizumab) and Avonex (interferon beta-1a), and it's easy to understand why Biogen has attracted more than its share of attention from would-be suitors. One-third of the small sliver of neurology drugs gaining FDA approval in 2015 fell into the antipsychotic drug category, including Alkermes' Aristada (aripiprazole lauroxil) for schiz–ophrenia and Vraylar (cariprazine) for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The market has grown crowded, mainly due to the revenue surge that often comes with the successful development of an antipsychotic. See also: Biogen ends Tecfidera DTC campaign, citing prescriptions Avanir Pharmaceuticals president and CEO Rohan Palekar has set his sights on growing the company into a major-league CNS player, an area he described to MM&M as the “widest open” of pharma sectors. Last January, Avanir's drug-device combo for the treatment of migraines, Onzetra Xsail, received FDA approval. On its heels, the company's AVP-786 is in Phase III trials for agitation in Alzheimer's patients and Phase II trials for depression and schizophrenia. Developed to constrict blood vessels and relieve swelling in the brain, triptans such as GlaxoSmithKline's Imitrex (sumatriptan) and Merck's Maxalt (rizatriptan) lead the acute migraine treatment market. Designed to interrupt a migraine already in progress, this class of drugs has attracted criticism for occasional ineffectiveness and side effects. Meanwhile, antibodies that block a chemical in the nervous system, calcitonin gene-related peptides (CGRP), are making waves in migraine prevention. Studies show patient improvements as soon as three days after the injection of Teva Pharmaceuticals' TEV-48125. Alder Therapeutics, Amgen, and Eli Lilly are also in the hunt. With continued trial success, these treatments are expected to launch in the next few years and may prove a boon for many. As the science piece of CNS disorders becomes clearer, leaders will need to pivot to provide a more personalized approach to support. Data and analytics are quickly emerging as means to an end. “The more data a doctor has about a patient, the more customized the treatment,” Densmore says. NEW SCIENCE, NEW APPROACH Innovations are on the horizon. In Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases, for example, small wearable adhesive sensors are being tested to collect data to measure patients' responses to treatments. “To find patients with a specific condition, data analytics techniques such as machine learning can identify patterns and characteristics that remain hidden when data are examined by human intervention,” says 81qd's EVP of data analytics, Kelly Myers. See also: Pharma companies turn to wearables to improve R&D The sector's struggle to identify patients has more far-reaching implications than just the individual's health. The patient-selection process in neurological disease trials is complicated by poor diagnostic technique, according to Fraser. “Objective measurement tools that correlate with clinical observation would be a big step forward in standardized patient inclusion and objective measurable outcomes,” he says. Reese agrees that clinical-trial protocols are creating a need to differentiate through tech integration, innovative customer service, and experiences that connect patient and HCP in more personalized care. Progress in the neurological arena will require collaboration among researchers, biopharma companies, and tech experts to advance the treatment options for these devastating diseases.

Shingrix is viewed by analysts as among the British company’s most promising experimental products, since it has shown greater protection among older recipients than Merck’s rival shot Zostavax. GSK itself highlighted Shingrix as one of its top near-term pipeline hopes last November, during its first research and development day in more than a decade. The company, which will see Emma Walmsley take over as chief executive in 2017, is seeking to revitalise a drug portfolio hit by falling sales of best-selling inhaled lung treatment Advair. READ NEXT Firms lose Luas court appeal In clinical trials, GSK’s vaccine remained 90% effective in people over age 70, even four years after injections. Zostavax efficacy, by contrast, varies between 18% and 70%, and it declines noticeably in older people. People who are 70 years or older are often most at risk from shingles, a painful, itchy rash that results from the reactivation of latent chickenpox virus. The impressive trial results should put Shingrix in a strong competitive position, analysts believe, even though it requires two doses, against just one for Zostavax, and it is also linked to more injection site reactions. Analysts, on average, predict that worldwide sales of Shingrix will reach $1.05bn in 2021, according to forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters.  Sales of Zostavax, the only shingles vaccine on the market at present, totalled $749m in 2015. GSK’s vaccine contains a component from US biotech firm Agenus, which is entitled to royalties on future sales. GSK said it planned to file Shingrix for European and Canadian approval before the end of this year, with Japan following in 2017.  GSK shares which were 0.5% lower in London trade have nonetheless gained almost 22% this year. Separately, GSK is involved in the race to find protection against the Zika virus. The prospect of a blockbuster vaccine against a mosquito-borne virus has accelerated the pace of development and attracted the interest of big drugmakers, including Sanofi and Takeda Pharmaceuticals. Although Zika infections are mild or asymptomatic in most people, demand for a vaccine is expected to be strong.

We've long known stress can wreak havoc on your mind and body. It has the potential to hurt your heart, your immune system, and even your memory. In an extreme case of stress-induced memory loss, a woman in England forgot her name, her husband's identity, and nearly everything else about her life after a nervous breakdown, The Daily Mail reports. Marie Coe, 55, was working upwards of 70 hours a week in a demanding job running an events company in the U.K., traveling constantly, all while also juggling a family and taking care of her household. One day, after she'd gone missing for 24 hours and couldn't remember anything, she asked a stranger at a gas station for help. An ambulance came, and she couldn't answer any of the paramedics' questions. After a CT scan revealed no head injuries, the doctors diagnosed her with "stress-induced amnesia,"according to The Daily Mail. This is, apparently, a real thing: Memory loss caused by extreme stress or trauma is actually "dissociative amnesia," according to Merck Manuals. It seems to run in families, according to The Cleveland Clinic. It can cause someone to forget everything, as with Coe, or it can concern specific areas of the sufferer's life. Sometimes, a person with the condition will forget who they are and go on to assume an entirely new identity without realizing it (this is known as "dissociative fugue."). When Coe's husband Mark picked her up from the hospital, she had no idea who he was. She didn't even know she was married. "It was terrifying sitting in the car with a strange man who claimed he was my husband," she told The Daily Mail. In a scenario reminiscent of 50 First Dates, he told her about their relationship and showed her photos of their grandchildren, and they got to know each other all over again — while living together. "Although it was frightening, it was exciting at the same time. Like a first date," she told the paper. "I looked at Mark's kind face and smiling eyes and knew I could see why the old me had fallen in love with him... We had romantic dinners together and talked and laughed until the small hours of the morning." She turned to hypnosis and meditation to regain her memory and manage her stress. These are common treatments for dissociative amnesia, along with individual and family therapy, art and music therapy, and sometimes medication, according to The Cleveland Clinic. The hypnotist explained to her that the amnesia was her brain's way of shutting down when she didn't allow it any other way to rest. Coe has since learned to practice better self-care. She closed her business and got a less demanding job in order to reduce her stress. "I've realized you can't give from an empty cup, so I look after myself rather than running myself ragged for everyone else's sake," she said. She still suffers from short-term memory problems, but her long-term memory is back. The silver lining of all this is that the incident has strengthened Coe's relationship with her husband. "When Mark said he'd look after me in sickness and in health, he really meant it," she said. "When I look back to that day in [the] hospital, I think I'd always hoped that man they were telling me was my hubby, as he was handsome and had a twinkle in his eye. I know he really is the man for me because I fell in love with him twice — and that must mean he's the one." Advertisement How To Deal With Stress • Mind • Wellness Illustrated by Tyler Spangler.

from its database. The report covers the market landscape and its growth prospects over the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market. (EMAILWIRE.COM, October 26, 2016 ) Antibodies are the proteins produced by B-cells (in the bone marrow) in the immune system. These proteins attach themselves to antigens, which act as markers, and are then destroyed by phagocytes. B-cells produce different antibodies, which attach themselves to different sites of an antigen. mAbs are monospecific, as they are the clones of a single parent cell. They are complex proteins with high molecular weight, and were first developed in 1975 by Kohler and Milstein. Publisher's analysts forecast the global monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) market to grow at a CAGR of 9.84% during the period 2016-2020.

He could stay on chemo and face the high risk of relapse associated with his particular disease, or he could undergo a blood or bone marrow transplant, which would offer the best chance of a cure but put him at risk for severe complications. To help guide the decision, Frederick Appelbaum, an expert in clinical research at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, and other doctors there used a new diagnostic test that analyzed the patient’s own cancer DNA, as well as the genetic makeup of his immune cells, and then used that information to detect whether trace amounts of the disease remained after his treatment. That’s something standard diagnostic tests can’t do well. The new test revealed leukemia cells still lurking in the patient’s body, so he opted for the transplant, despite the additional risk. He’s now in remission, says Appelbaum. A T cell from the immune system of a person in good health. The diagnostic test, called ClonoSEQ, is the first product introduced by Adaptive Biotechnologies, which was founded in 2009 by brothers Chad and Harlan Robins. (Appelbaum is an advisor to Adaptive.) Harlan originally came up with the concept for the test at Hutchinson, where he holds a faculty position. His idea was to use DNA sequencing to scrutinize the genes of T and B cells, which are the building blocks of the immune system. Unlike other cells in the body, T and B cells constantly reshuffle their DNA in response to pathogens in their environment. Adaptive’s technology is designed to detect those changes—essentially tracking the immune responses of individual patients over time. The idea of sequencing the DNA of immune cells is still in its infancy and pursued mostly by academics and a handful of companies, so Adaptive must establish demand for a whole new category of test. In the past seven years, working with his brother Chad, a Wharton MBA and experienced executive, Robins has raised more than $400 million from a cadre of A-list investors including Matrix Capital Management, biotechnology giant Celgene, and Illumina, the leading maker of gene-sequencing technology. Understanding the immune system has become a priority in oncology research, particularly with the recent success of a class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors, which block proteins in the body that would normally prevent the immune system from recognizing and fighting cancer. Two leading examples are Merck’s Keytruda and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo, used to treat melanoma, lung cancer, and other tumor types. Many more checkpoint inhibitors are being developed, as are other immune approaches, such as removing T cells from patients and engineering them to attack their specific cancers (see 10 Breakthrough Technologies 2016: Immune Engineering). Such immune-based treatments have improved the prognosis for some cancer patients, but others don’t respond to them at all—and scientists have not yet figured out why. “Oncologists had been trying to figure out how to coöpt the immune system to help kill cancer for 40 years, and finally they’re finding success,” Robins says. For treatments like checkpoint inhibitors to be effective, he explains, there must first be an existing immune response in the tumor. Adaptive’s technology measures that response. Illumina sees Adaptive’s approach as the next frontier in gene sequencing, says John Leite, vice president of marketing for Illumina’s oncology business, in addition to looking for genetic mutations in cancer cells that may help patients respond to particular therapies. Adaptive has shown that its test can be much more sensitive to disease than other tools, such as the cell-counting technology called flow cytometry. The insights gained from sequencing immune cells may include identifying which patients are most likely to respond to a particular immuno-oncology drug, pinpointing other drugs that might be effectively used in combination with that treatment, and suggesting what order the drugs should be taken in for best results, says Chad Robins. In January Adaptive formed a partnership with Pfizer aimed at identifying patients who are most likely to benefit from the immuno-oncology drugs the company is developing. And it is working with other large pharmaceutical companies as well. Beyond cancer, the technology could be useful in treating other diseases with a strong immune component, including autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, the Robinses say. It could be helpful in controlling infectious diseases, too. The brothers won’t reveal their pricing strategy for ClonoSEQ or future products, but they believe they’ll ultimately be able to prove that immuno-sequencing lowers costs by reducing the risk of disease recurrence and helping patients avoid expensive treatments that are unlikely to work for them. To prove the value of its test to oncologists, Adaptive has worked with scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles, to study its use in patients with melanoma, myeloma, leukemia, and lymphoma. Last year the company opened a research center in San Diego that’s using its system to generate ideas for new drugs. The ability to genetically profile immune cells is part of a larger push in oncology to scrutinize the cells and tissues that coexist with cancer and affect its ability to persist, says Jill O’Donnell-Tormey, chief executive officer and director of scientific affairs at the Cancer Research Institute in New York. Surviving cancer, she says, “is about what is happening not just in the tumor, but in the immune cells.” From Our Advertisers In partnership with Dynatrace Emerging Trend Analysis: What is Digital Performance Management?

Shares, which have climbed 4.2% in the past 12 months, rose 2.1% to $292 in premarket trading. The vast majority of Biogen's revenue comes from multiple sclerosis drugs that some analysts see as growing relatively slowly. Cambridge, Mass.-based Biogen has focused its research-and-development efforts on new treatments for multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. The firm is spinning off its hemophilia drug business, where sales have been rising at a faster clip but make up a smaller chunk of total revenue. Sales of its biggest drug, Tecfidera, grew 10% its latest quarter and drove growth. Tecfidera brought in $1.03 billion during the period, representing roughly 41% of product revenue. The company said the MS drug was helped by inventory build. Meanwhile, the company's two hemophilia drugs grew at a much faster pace, and brought in a combined $217 million. Chief Executive George Scangos announced in July he would be leaving the company, allowing a new chief to lead the company as it works to reignite growth. The biotechnology giant has also drawn takeover interest from drug companies such as Merck Co. and Allergan PLC, The Wall Street Journal reported in August. Overall for the third quarter, Biogen reported a profit of $1.03 billion, or $4.71 a share, up from $965.6 million, or $4.15 a share, a year earlier. Excluding the restructuring charges, among other items, per-share earnings rose to $5.19 from $4.48. Total revenue rose 6% to $2.96 billion. Analysts had projected adjusted earnings of $4.97 a share on sales of $2.91 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.

ALSO READ US stocks end in the red US stocks end in the red US stocks end in the red US stocks end in the red US stocks end in the red Lackluster spate of earnings and weak economic data affect momentum U.S. stocks finished lower on Tuesday, 25 October 2016 giving back some of the previous day's advance as worries about a lackluster spate of earnings and a slip in a reading of consumer confidence weighed on market sentiment. A drop in the price of oil below $50 a barrel, lingering uncertainty about the U.S. presidential election and growing expectations of a rate increase by the Federal Reserve, also contributed to the downbeat mood. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 53.76 points, or 0.3%, at 18,169.27, as shares of Home Depot weighed on blue-chips with a 3.2% decline. Earlier, the average had been down as many as 71 points. The Nasdaq Composite Index gave up 26.45 points, or 0.5%, to wrap at 5,283.40. The S&P 500 declined by 8.17 points, or 0.4%, to 2,143.16.

At the age of 11, while babysitting for a Lawn Doctor franchise owner, she was asked to help out after the children went to bed by making phone calls to schedule lawn evaluation appointments. Armed with a phone book, Caryn quickly learned that using the right words and connecting with the right person was the difference between a successful call and a "no-go." She also learned not to give up. A graduate of J.P. Stevens High School in Edison, that early experience helped her launch a successful business development company. Kopp Consulting's Door Opener Service helps b2b clients access the sales opportunities they wouldn't otherwise access so they can close more sales. Today, Kopp Consulting, has evolved into a MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR A YEAR BUSINESS and has earned a spot on the prestigious NJ Biz Fast 50 list as one of the state's 50 most successful and fastest growing private companies, an honor most every NJ business strives to achieve. "I am proud and honored to be included among the community of high-growth companies but I'm mostly proud of the growth we've contributed to our clients' businesses," says Caryn Kopp, Founder and Chief Door Opener at Kopp Consulting. Recently, two New Jersey based Door Opener clients, TeamPar and Phoenix Marketing Solutions, each closed sales of over $1 million dollars as a direct result of their partnership with Kopp's Door Opener Service. Additionally, one of Kopp's clients, GD (General Devices) has also won the 2016 NJ Fast 50 Award. One of Kopp's technology clients targeting C level executives in large media and entertainment companies had meetings with ABC, NBC, Universal, HBO, Cable Vision and the list goes on, due to Door Opener strategies. "We grew this company because we are a team of high level, strategic business developers who create the right sales messaging and work to personally engage decision makers. We get our clients more of the initial conversations and meetings they can't get on their own. Our proprietary strategies work and clients keep coming back for more because we're helping them grow their businesses and give them access to sales opportunities they previously only dreamed about," adds Caryn. Many companies struggle with their own sales and sales teams, quarter after quarter, year after year. Kopp's proprietary Door Opener Service, Strategic Sales Insights and trademarked Moment of Yes Sales Message Development Process pave the way for clients to have a seat at the table with high profile, difficult to reach prospects. These introductions help Kopp clients accelerate profitable sales and eliminate the barriers to success they previously experienced. "When clients achieve success like adding over $5 million dollars in new revenue to their businesses, increasing close ratios from 20% to 48% or being included in RFPs AFTER the RFP process officially closed, we know we're doing business development right!" says Kopp. The NJBIZ recognition follows Kopp Consulting being featured on the 2016 Inc. 5000, being selected as Smart CEO Future 50 recipient and being named Sales Outsourcing Provider of the Year. We're very proud to be honored with the NJ Biz Fast 50 status, thankful for our wonderful clients and the magic our Door Openers create for our clients every day," said Kopp. About Kopp Consulting Inc.

The Humira Biosimilars Clinical Trial Insight report gives comprehensive clinical insight on 33 biosimilars version of Humira drug in clinical pipeline. More than 10 of these biosimilars are in Phase-III trials and are expected to be commercially available in next 5-8 years. The patent protection assigned to Humira will expire in 2016 for US and 2018 for European market. The Humira stands for Human Monoclonal Antibody in Rheumatoid Arthritis. It is also termed as Adalimumab or D2E7 and is a recombinant Immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody which is specific for tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a). It is a drug designed by the mode of recombinant DNA technology for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In the rheumatoid arthritis adalimumab has the equivalent efficacy as that of methotrexate. It is produced by Abbot Laboratories but originally Humira was emerged from collaboration between Bioresearch Center in Massachusetts (BASF) and the Cambridge Antibody Technologies in the UK. Mid stage clinical trials were so promising that, at the end of 2000, Abbott agreed to buy the BASF Bioresearch Center for US$ 6.9 Billion. When Humira was launched in 2003, it was the third TNF-alpha antibody to the market. Its US, FDA approval for marketing was achieved on December 31, 2002. In 2012 to 2015 Humira topped the top selling pharmaceutical product lists and in 2015, Humira had topped US$ 14 Billion of sales globally. However, its superior dosing schedule and improved toleration over existing therapy enabled it to become the best in class agent. Furthermore, Abbott had a robust development program for Humira and expanded its use to other inflammatory disease such as psoriasis, Crohn's disease, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. While prescribed to far fewer patients than Lipitor, the high cost of this biological medicine is such that Humira's sales were projected to exceed US$ 9 Billion. In December 2014, Indian drug maker Cadila Healthcare declared the launch of the first adalimumab biosimilar at a fifth of its U.S. price. The generic has been launched under the brand name Exemptia. In January 2016, another Indian drug maker Torrent Pharmaceuticals launched its biosimilar for adalimumab. Torrent's Adfrar would be the second generic biosimilar of adalimumab in the world. In September 2016 the US FDA approved Amgens biosimilar adalimumab-atto sold under the brand name Amjevita.

Originally based in Brooklyn, N.Y., Marlin Steel moved to Baltimore when it was acquired by current President and Owner Drew Greenblatt in 1998. As demand for bagels declined and bagel basket imports flooded the U.S. market, Mr. Greenblatt recognized that Marlin Steel needed to shift the focus of its business to ensure continued growth. In the early 2000s, Marlin Steel invested in automated manufacturing robots, which expanded productivity and allowed the company to focus on highly engineered products, such as wire baskets, mesh baskets, material handling baskets and steel racks and baskets, which are in demand by many other industrial sectors ranging from automotive and aerospace to machinery and pharmaceuticals. Employing 24 steelworkers at its Baltimore facility, small Marlin Steel is a supplier to many large industrial companies, including Boeing, Caterpillar, Cummins, Ford, General Electric, General Motors, Honda, Lockheed Martin, Merck and Toyota. Marlin Steel wire conveyor basket used by the automotive industry on assembly lines in Michigan, Kentucky, Indiana and Ohio. Photo courtesy of Marlin Steel Wire Products LLC. Marlin Steel exports to 39 countries, and 25 percent of the company’s sales and jobs depend on exports. Mr. Greenblatt says that “free trade agreements level the playing field for U.S. goods and open markets for ‘Made in the USA’ exports by eliminating anti-manufacturing taxes and other barriers. If we could get rid of tariffs through the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), Marlin Steel could hire unemployed Baltimore steelworkers for jobs that pay $25 per hour—that is, if Congress passes this critical agreement.” The TPP would eliminate all tariffs on products manufactured by Marlin Steel, including the 5 percent tariff charged on Marlin Steel’s exports to New Zealand and tariffs levied on these products by Vietnam (20 percent) and Malaysia (5 percent). As Mr. Greenblatt underscored in a recent Fox News “The Deciders” segment, “If you want to grow jobs, if you want to grow our country, we need more clients; we need new markets. America only has 4 percent of the world’s population. We need to export like crazy, and that’s how we’re going to grow, and that’s how we’re going to hire unemployed steelworkers.”   Read more TPP in Real Life stories here.

Mit der Krebs-Immuntherapie Keytruda verzeichneten die Amerikaner im dritten Quartal das mit Abstand stärkste Wachstum bei ihren Medikamenten. Die Erlöse mit dem Mittel stiegen um 124 Prozent auf 356 Millionen Euro, wie Merck&Co am Dienstag mitteilte. Dagegen kämpft das Unternehmen mit seinem bislang umsatzstärksten Medikament, dem Diabetes-Mittel Januvia, weiterhin mit rückläufigen Erlösen. Insgesamt setzte der Pharmakonzern 10,5 Milliarden Dollar um, ein Plus von fünf Prozent. Der Nettogewinn kletterte binnen Jahresfrist um fast ein Fünftel auf 2,2 Milliarden Dollar. Für das Gesamtjahr hob Merck darauf seine Umsatz- und Ergebnisprognose an. Keytruda ist einer der größten Hoffnungsträger der Amerikaner. Für Aufsehen hatten Anfang Oktober neue Daten gesorgt, wonach mit Keytruda eine deutliche Verbesserung bei der Behandlung von Lungenkrebspatienten erreicht werden konnte. Das Mittel war darauf am Montag zum Einsatz bei Lungenkrebspatienten zugelassen worden, die bislang noch nicht behandelt wurden. Es ist zudem bereits zur Behandlung von bestimmten Lungenkrebsarten und fortgeschrittenem schwarzen Hautkrebs auf dem Markt. Analysten erwarten, dass Keytruda bis 2021 auf jährliche Umsätze von rund acht Milliarden Dollar kommen könnte.

Sean Williams (TMFUltraLong) Oct 25, 2016 at 8:23AM Some great drug stocks could be hiding in plain view. Image source: Getty Images. U.S. stocks have been taken for a wild ride in 2016, but at least most long-term investors can relish the fact that despite the volatility, the broader market indexes are all higher year-to-date. The same can't be said for the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF or VanEck Vectors Pharmaceutical ETF, which are down 15% and 16% year to date, respectively. These top drug stocks are cheap and possibly worth buying Drug stocks sold off hard to begin the year as investors sought the security of less risky, profitable investments. Remember, most drug developers aren't profitable on a recurring basis, meaning valuations can be prone to wild swings based on emotions and clinical data. While this move lower in drug stocks has left some investors in the sector disappointed, it's also created quite the opportunity to pick up top drug stocks on the cheap this fall. Here are four cheap drug stocks worth considering for your portfolio. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. Israeli-based Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) isn't exactly a household name, but with its shares down 35% year-to-date, perhaps it should be for investors. Teva's business has traditionally been split into two components: branded therapeutics and generic drugs. The biggest concern for Teva has been that its biggest branded therapeutic, Copaxone, a long-standing injectable treatment for multiple sclerosis, lost patent protection and is facing exposure to generic competition. With Copaxone at one time accounting for more than 20% of Teva's sales, the fear had been that Teva's growth could stall for years to come. Image source: Teva Pharmaceutical. However, Teva's been a busy bee. It used legal wrangling to keep a generic version of Copaxone off the market for as long as possible in order to reformulate Copaxone into a more convenient dosage that could be injected less often. This new formulation that was introduced should allow Teva to switch longtime customers over without losing many of its customers to generic versions of its original Copaxone injection. Teva also acquired Allergan's generic drug division, Actavis, in a $40.5 billion cash-and-stock deal. Some analysts have been leery about how quickly Teva will realize benefits from this deal, and they've also been concerned with asset sales Teva has had to make in order to appease regulators in Europe. Ultimately, though, this could be a giant growth-driver for Teva, which now becomes the largest generic drug manufacturer in the world. With IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics predicting that generic scripts could make up 91% to 92% of prescriptions written by 2020, Teva presumably could be a volume and pricing power winner. Currently trading at just over seven times Wall Street's 2017 profit projections and paying out more than 3% annually, Teva looks like a cheap drug stock worth your consideration. Gilead Sciences Inc. Perhaps the only other drug stock that can give Teva Pharmaceutical a run for its money in the value column is biotech blue-chip Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD). Gilead's shares are down 28% this year as hepatitis C sales declines have disappointed Wall Street and investors. You could say that Gilead Sciences has become a victim of its own success. Increasing competition in hepatitis C, along with hitting the low-hanging fruit in the United States, have tempered HCV sales expectations going forward. During the second quarter, Harvoni sales declined by more than $1 billion to $2.56 billion, leaving Wall Street wondering where Gilead's next growth surge will come from. Image source: Getty Images. The good news for Gilead and its shareholders is that hepatitis C should remain a strong cash cow for many years to come. Though competition in HCV does exist, Gilead is likely to retain most HCV market share for a variety of reasons. For example, there's nothing that's more convenient or effective than Harvoni or it's recently introduced pan-genotypic oral HCV pill, Epclusa. There's always a possibility that another drugmaker could develop a treatment that's effective at removing the hepatitis C virus at four or six weeks, but any such therapy is likely many years out at best. Gilead's rapport with physicians in HCV and the effectiveness of its HCV drugs should result in substantial cash flow generation year in and year out. Gilead could also benefit from using its cash flow to make acquisitions. In Nov. 2011, Gilead acquired little-known Pharmasset for $11 billion, giving it access to what would eventually set the foundation to its blockbuster HCV franchise. Gilead could look to bolster its dominant antiviral portfolio and angle for a hepatitis B or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis cure, or it may opt to join the fast-growing cancer drug space. Like Teva, Gilead is paying out an above-average yield of 2.6%, and it's trading at a minuscule six times next year's estimated full-year EPS. It just about doesn't get cheaper than that. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Another big drug stock to take it on the chin recently is Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY). Shares of Bristol-Myers are down 28% year-to-date and 35% over the past three months. The reason? Look no further than its recent CheckMate-026 results. In August, Bristol-Myers Squibb announced that its blockbuster cancer immunotherapy Opdivo had failed to reach its primary endpoint of a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) for first-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients whose tumors had PD-L1 expression of 5% or greater. A couple weeks ago we got the specifics of the CheckMate-026 trial, with the chemotherapy placebo actually demonstrating modest favorability in PFS and Opdivo having a slight edge in overall survival. Compounding Bristol-Myers' woes, competing cancer immunotherapy Keytruda, developed by Merck, met its mark with flying colors in first-line NSCLC in patients whose tumors had at least 50% PD-L1 expression. Losing out on first-line NSCLC could cost Opdivo a few billion dollars in peak sales, and Wall Street is none too pleased.   Image source: Bristol-Myers Squibb. Despite this disappointing result, investors should keep a couple of things in mind about Opdivo. For starters, it tends to work best as a combination therapy, and CheckMate-026 was a monotherapy study. Secondly, it's not uncommon for cancer drugs to respond differently to separate types of cancer. Lastly, Opdivo, remains a standard-of-care therapy in second-line NSCLC and second-line renal cell carcinoma. It has numerous ongoing combination trials as well which could easily lead to expansion opportunities. For Bristol-Myers Squibb, Opdivo's latest hiccup may prove to be nothing more than a speed bump. Don't forget that Bristol-Myers Squibb also has a growing pipeline and some rapidly growing existing therapies. Eliquis, an oral blood-thinning drug that was developed with Pfizer and could have ample label expansion opportunities yet to come, is on track for more than $3 billion in annual sales this year. Through the first-half of 2016, sales of the drug are up 91%.   With its PEG ratio hovering around one, and Bristol-Myers still sitting on a veritable gold mine in Opdivo, investors should take notice. Celgene Corporation A final biotech blue-chip that always seems to be cheap is Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG). Shares of the company are down 18% year-to-date. The wind came out of Celgene's sails earlier this year when the drugmaker, which is known for its transparency, provided sales and profit guidance for fiscal 2017 that were slightly below expectations. The reason for the lowered earnings guidance primarily rests with lung, breast, and pancreatic cancer drug Abraxane, which has seen slower growth in the wake of tougher competition from cancer immunotherapies. Image source: Getty Images. However, Celgene is far more than just Abraxane. The company's lead therapy is multiple myeloma blockbuster Revlimid, which looks to be on pace for $10 billion in annual sales by the end of the decade, if not more. Revlimid has benefited from an increased number of multiple myeloma diagnoses, consistent or growing market share, improved pricing power, and the potential for more than a half-dozen label expansion opportunities still to come. Celgene could also reap significant rewards from its M&A and collaboration strategies. Celgene acquired Receptos for $7.2 billion last year in order to gain hold of ozanimod, an experimental oral drug with a lot of promise to treat multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis. Celgene's management team believes ozanimod could have the potential to eclipse $4 billion in annual peak sales. In terms of collaborations, Celgene has more than 30 licensing partners that could translate into it getting a piece of the pie in numerous first-in-class oncology or anti-inflammatory therapies. Relying heavily on collaborations also means that Celgene is spending its money on only the most promising drug candidates. A sub-one PEG ratio makes Celgene a drug stock to closely monitor.

According to a January study by the Hutchinson Institute for Cancer Outcomes Research, one-third of cancer survivors go into debt, and 3 percent file for bankruptcy. “Research shows that financial distress is [at least] equal to the fear of dying from the disease,” says Dan Sherman, owner of the NaVectis Group, which educates hospital personnel on how to assist with financial navigation for cancer patients. “Some who are diagnosed with cancer do everything they possibly can, and go through a lot of [financial] resources. Others try to keep their families from becoming destitute.” While he recalls an extreme example — a man who chose to forgo treatment and hasten his death so he could pass away before a $200,000 term-life insurance policy expired — many patients spend money first and deal with consequences later. Here are a few who did what they had to in order to stay alive — alongside expert advice that might have helped salve the financial pain. More on this...

More often, it’s having to stop working during treatment, as was the case with Forest Hills resident Bob Tufts, who felt the sting of losing two incomes after he was diagnosed with a blood-related cancer in 2009. The 61-year-old former Wall Street executive had expenses that included his daughter’s college tuition and recalls 14 months of not working — and the double whammy of his wife taking off work to be his caregiver. “She was running all over the place, and trying to work was almost impossible,” he says. After digging through a good chunk of his savings in order to live, he wound up pulling $10,000 to $15,000 out of his 401(k), which comes with heavy tax penalties.

Sean Williams (TMFUltraLong) Oct 25, 2016 at 8:23AM Some great drug stocks could be hiding in plain view. Image source: Getty Images. U.S. stocks have been taken for a wild ride in 2016, but at least most long-term investors can relish the fact that despite the volatility, the broader market indexes are all higher year-to-date. The same can't be said for the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF or VanEck Vectors Pharmaceutical ETF, which are down 15% and 16% year to date, respectively. These top drug stocks are cheap and possibly worth buying Drug stocks sold off hard to begin the year as investors sought the security of less risky, profitable investments. Remember, most drug developers aren't profitable on a recurring basis, meaning valuations can be prone to wild swings based on emotions and clinical data. While this move lower in drug stocks has left some investors in the sector disappointed, it's also created quite the opportunity to pick up top drug stocks on the cheap this fall. Here are four cheap drug stocks worth considering for your portfolio. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. Israeli-based Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) isn't exactly a household name, but with its shares down 35% year-to-date, perhaps it should be for investors. Teva's business has traditionally been split into two components: branded therapeutics and generic drugs. The biggest concern for Teva has been that its biggest branded therapeutic, Copaxone, a long-standing injectable treatment for multiple sclerosis, lost patent protection and is facing exposure to generic competition. With Copaxone at one time accounting for more than 20% of Teva's sales, the fear had been that Teva's growth could stall for years to come. Image source: Teva Pharmaceutical. However, Teva's been a busy bee. It used legal wrangling to keep a generic version of Copaxone off the market for as long as possible in order to reformulate Copaxone into a more convenient dosage that could be injected less often. This new formulation that was introduced should allow Teva to switch longtime customers over without losing many of its customers to generic versions of its original Copaxone injection. Teva also acquired Allergan's generic drug division, Actavis, in a $40.5 billion cash-and-stock deal. Some analysts have been leery about how quickly Teva will realize benefits from this deal, and they've also been concerned with asset sales Teva has had to make in order to appease regulators in Europe. Ultimately, though, this could be a giant growth-driver for Teva, which now becomes the largest generic drug manufacturer in the world.

molecule drug, finds Frost & Sullivan's Global TechVision Team News provided by Frost & Sullivan Oct 25, 2016, 05:31 ET Share this article LONDON, Oct. 25, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Over the past two decades, big pharmaceutical companies increased their focus on biologics. Several companies recorded a revenue growth of more than 10 percent from biologics during the last 5 years, and in 2015, biologics dominated the list of the top 10 drugs by revenue. Already, nearly 50 percent of AstraZeneca's and Eli Lilly's clinical-stage molecules are biologics. Since pharma-biotech is extremely research intensive and involves huge capital investment during the drug development lifecycle, innovator companies are guarding their intellectual property rights through patenting in target markets. Biologics IP – A Strategic Review is part of the TechVision (Health & Wellness) Growth Partnership Service program and provides a strategic overview of the patenting activity of the top 13 pharma-biotech companies in the area of biologics. The analyses will help pharma-biotech companies understand the competitive landscape and the available white space so they can align their IP strategy with their corporate strategy. Continue Reading Big Pharma Focus on Building Patent Portfolio to Gain Competitive Edge in Biologics Sector For complimentary access to more information on this research, please visit: http://corpcom.frost.com/forms/EU_PR_JSchoneborn_D6AE_Oct16 "Big pharma that are keen to stay ahead of the curve have harnessed the rapid improvements in the field of biotechnology and genomics, and rolled out biologics-based drugs," finds TechVision Senior Consultant Manmohan Singh. "Key merger and acquisition deals such as Roche-Genentech and Sanofi-Genzyme were largely driven by companies' vision of building complementary capabilities in the area of biologics." Roche, GlaxoSmithKline and Merck & Co. are the top three patent holders. Antibodies, peptides and vaccines are the top three biologics types, while the top three therapeutic areas experiencing the highest patent activity are oncology, infectious diseases and immunological disorders. "Yet, as biologics have proved safer and more efficient than small molecules, major pharmaceutical companies are investing greater resources in the R&D of large molecule products," notes Singh. "With biosimilars, or follow-on biologics, production is based on reference biologics after the patents for these biologics expire."

Several companies recorded a revenue growth of more than 10 percent from biologics during the last 5 years, and in 2015, biologics dominated the list of the top 10 drugs by revenue. Already, nearly 50 percent of AstraZeneca's and Eli Lilly's clinical-stage molecules are biologics. Since pharma-biotech is extremely research intensive and involves huge capital investment during the drug development lifecycle, innovator companies are guarding their intellectual property rights through patenting in target markets.

(AKAO) is scheduled to present data from Cohort 2 of phase III clinical trial of Plazomicin in patients with serious bacterial infections due to carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae on Saturday, October 29, 2016. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE, are a family of germs that are difficult to treat because they have high levels of resistance to antibiotics. Klebsiella species and Escherichia coli (E. coli) are examples of Enterobacteriaceae, a normal part of the human gut bacteria, that can become carbapenem-resistant. (Source: CDC). The phase III trial of Plazomicin, dubbed CARE, includes Cohort 1, which is a randomized one with 39 patients, and Cohort 2, which is a single-arm expanded eligibility cohort with 30 patients with confirmed CRE. Another pivotal trial evaluating Plazomicin in complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs), known as EPIC, is also underway. Top-line results from the CARE and EPIC trials are expected to be reported in early Q1 2017. AKAO closed Monday's trading at $5.31, down 3.28%. Shares of Aduro Biotech Inc. (ADRO) fell as much as 11% on Monday on news that the clinical trials of its investigational product from its LADD platform - CRS-207 - have been placed on partial clinical hold to pause new patient enrollment. Aduro's LADD platform uses novel, live-attenuated Listeria to deliver tumor antigens. The partial hold was initiated after a blood culture sample from an indwelling port of a metastatic pancreatic cancer patient who presented with gastrointestinal symptoms tested positive for Listeria. Patients currently receiving a LADD-based agent (except one currently identified patient, due to the presence of a pacemaker) are continuing to receive treatment, with several of these patients having been on study drug for six months or longer, the company noted. ADRO closed Monday's trading at $11.70, down 4.49%. DBV Technologies S.A.'s (DBVT) two-year follow-up study of Viaskin Peanut for the treatment of peanut-allergic children, dubbed OLFUS-VIPES, has demonstrated favorable safety and high compliance, consistent with prior results. OLFUS-VIPES, or OLFUS, is the follow-up study to VIPES, the company's phase IIb clinical trial of Viaskin Peanut. Previously, the company reported positive results from VIPES in September 2014 and provided an interim analysis from the first 12 months of OLFUS in October 2015. DBVT closed Monday's trading at $35.31, down 0.73%. In after-hours, the stock was up 0.27% to $35.41. Global Blood Therapeutics Inc. (GBT) is all set to initiate a pivotal trial for GBT440 in adults and adolescents with sickle cell disease in December of this year. The phase III trial, dubbed HOPE, is designed to enroll up to 400 patients age 12 and older with sickle cell disease who have had at least one episode of vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) in the previous year. The top-line data from the HOPE study are anticipated in the first half of 2019. GBT closed Monday's trading at $17.75, down 5.84%. Shares of Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. (INO) slid more than 16% on Monday, following a clinical hold on the company's proposed phase III clinical program for VGX-3100. VGX-3100 is an investigational DNA immunotherapy candidate designed to treat precancers and cancers caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). The treatment is administered to patients by injection into muscle (typically in the arm), followed by electroporation using Inovio's CELLECTRA device. The phase III study of VGX-3100 has not been initiated, and has not enrolled or dosed subjects. The FDA has requested additional data to support the shelf-life of the newly designed and manufactured disposable parts of the CELLECTRA 5PSP immunotherapy delivery device. The company is optimistic of submitting the requested data to the FDA before the end of this year. Accordingly, the phase III clinical program of VGX-3100 will not start until the first half of 2017 pending resolution of the FDA's requests. INO closed Monday's trading at $6.99, down 16.39%. Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc. (LGND) has earned a $1.5 million milestone payment from its partner Melinta Therapeutics, following the submission of New Drug Applications of IV and oral Baxdela for the treatment of patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections. Baxdela is eligible for priority review by the FDA, and a regulatory decision is expected to be announced by mid-year 2017. LGND closed Monday's trading at $93.99, up 0.51%. The FDA on Monday approved Merck's (MRK) KEYTRUDA for yet another indication - this time, for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. The approval for the new indication comes 2 months ahead of the decision date of December 24, 2016. Keytruda was first approved in September 2014 for treatment of patients with advanced or unresectable melanoma who are no longer responding to other drugs. The other indications for which the drug is approved are metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, and recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The sales of the drug for full year 2015 were $566 million, and were $563 million in the first half of this year. MRK closed Monday's trading at $60.75, down 0.74%. Canadian specialty pharma company Theratechnologies Inc. (TH.TO) and its partner TaiMed Biologics Inc. eagerly await the top-line results of a phase III study of Ibalizumab in combination with optimized background regimen, in patients infected with multi-drug resistant HIV-1, which are expected to be available in the coming weeks. The last patient enrolled in the trial has finished the treatment phase of the study, and analysis of the data is now being completed. TH.TO closed Monday's trading at C$3.32, unchanged from the previous day's close. Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VNDA) has agreed to settle its ongoing patent litigation with Taro Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc. and Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. related to schizophrenia drug Fanapt. Taro had filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application seeking approval of its generic version of Vanda's Fanapt. The patent on Fanapt expires on November 2, 2027. Now that Vanda is settling the patent litigation, Taro has been granted a non-exclusive license to manufacture and commercialize its version of Fanapt in the U. S. effective November 2, 2027. However, if Vanda obtains pediatric exclusivity for Fanapt, Taro will have to wait until May 2, 2028 to market its generic version of the drug. Fanapt garnered sales of $65.6 million in 2015 and $35.63 million in the first half of 2016. VNDA closed Monday's trading at $15.85, up 0.13%. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News The Most Influential Books In Business Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 Forget Canada: The Best Places To Flee Trump's America Canadian News AMGN Crosses BRIDGE, Anxiety Over PTCT's Translarna Eases, EGRX Opens Wallet ANTH Plunges As Lupus Trial Fails, BMY's Opdivo Is At It Again, FDA Nod For GILD Here's Why ISB Food Group Is Recalling These Ice Cream Brands ADAP Surges As FDA Lifts Clinical Hold, OCUL Catches Eyes, RegeneRx On The Rise MDCO Tastes Bitter, PRTO Awaits Phase 3 Data In Dec., It's Time To Cherish IONS Concordia Suspending Guidance After Management Shake-up Six Late Stage Drugs That Bit The Dust Recently 7 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus RELATED NEWS Merck: Researchers To Provide More 30 Than Data Presentations At ID Week Merck Q3 Profit Rises; Lifts 2016 Outlook Merck & Co Q3 16 Earnings Conference Call At 8:00 AM ET Merck & Co Inc.

The other indications for which the drug is approved are metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, and recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The sales of the drug for full year 2015 were $566 million, and were $563 million in the first half of this year. MRK closed Monday's trading at $60.75, down 0.74%. Canadian specialty pharma company Theratechnologies Inc. (TH.TO) and its partner TaiMed Biologics Inc. eagerly await the top-line results of a phase III study of Ibalizumab in combination with optimized background regimen, in patients infected with multi-drug resistant HIV-1, which are expected to be available in the coming weeks. The last patient enrolled in the trial has finished the treatment phase of the study, and analysis of the data is now being completed. TH.TO closed Monday's trading at C$3.32, unchanged from the previous day's close. Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VNDA) has agreed to settle its ongoing patent litigation with Taro Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc. and Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. related to schizophrenia drug Fanapt. Taro had filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application seeking approval of its generic version of Vanda's Fanapt. The patent on Fanapt expires on November 2, 2027. Now that Vanda is settling the patent litigation, Taro has been granted a non-exclusive license to manufacture and commercialize its version of Fanapt in the U. S. effective November 2, 2027. However, if Vanda obtains pediatric exclusivity for Fanapt, Taro will have to wait until May 2, 2028 to market its generic version of the drug. Fanapt garnered sales of $65.6 million in 2015 and $35.63 million in the first half of 2016. VNDA closed Monday's trading at $15.85, up 0.13%.

The previous guidance was for a three-shot regimen, but studies have shown that two doses work just as well. Experts predict that the simpler, more flexible timeline will result in higher rates of HPV vaccination, which has lagged among both girls and boys. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which counsels the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention on the nation’s vaccine schedule, voted Wednesday for the change. The CDC is expected to accept the recommendation. Under the new schedule, the first of two doses of the HPV vaccine should be administered at age 11 or 12, although it could be given as early as age 9, as under the previous policy. The second dose would be administered six to 12 months after the first dose. The new recommendation does not apply to adolescents who begin getting vaccinated after they turn 15. They should still get three shots over a six-month period, the panel said. The HPV vaccine prevents cervical, vaginal, anal, and head and neck cancers, as well as precancerous lesions and genital warts. The most widely used vaccine is Gardasil, manufactured by Merck. The rate of HPV inoculation, while increasing in the last year or so, remains below that of other childhood vaccines. Last year, for example, about half of boys ages 13 to 17 had gotten at least one of the recommended three doses, while about 63 percent of girls had gotten at least one dose, according to the CDC. Cancer experts and public health officials hope a two-shot regimen will boost those figures. “By reducing the number of doses needed to complete HPV vaccination, it should lead to an increase in the percentage of eligible boys and girls who get vaccinated,” said Douglas Lowy, acting director of the National Cancer Institute. Lowy and his NCI colleague John Schiller developed the technology that underlies the HPV vaccine.

The Wall Street Journal: Faith-Based Investor Group Calls For Drugmakers To Be Transparent On Pricing A group of 300 institutional investors, including many with ties to religious organizations, is waging a new campaign to press drugmakers to justify their price increases. The investors, members of the New York-based Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, are asking 17 drug companies—including Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer Inc. and Merck & Co.—to be more transparent about when and why they raise prices. (Loftus, 10/24) Stat: Interfaith Investor Coalition Pushes Shareholder Resolutions On Drug Prices In the latest bid to put a lid on rising drug costs, a coalition of 300 institutional investors has filed shareholder resolutions with 11 big US drug makers to explain and justify all price increases and the risks these may pose to stockholders. At the same time, the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility also wrote six large European companies to schedule talks about transparency around their pricing. The resolutions ask the companies to issue reports by November that list the rates of price increases for all of their top-selling brand-name medicines between 2010 and 2016, along with the rationale and criteria used to raise prices. (Silverman, 10/24) Roll Call: FDA Approval Changes Could Affect Drug Prices Upcoming changes to the Food and Drug Administration’s reviews for generic drugs could have an impact on drug prices if they help introduce more competition to the market. In separate public meetings on Thursday and Friday, FDA officials discussed their plans for renewing the programs that charge generic drugmakers a fee to go through the application process. The FDA has been scrutinized for aspects of its generic approval programs that critics contend prevent cheaper generic therapies from coming to market. (Siddons, 10/24) The Fiscal Times: Prescription Drug Prices Headed For Double-Digit Increases In 2017 Specialty drugs get a lot of attention when it comes to higher costs, although price increases are occurring across the board. Specialty drug prices are projected to increase 18.7 percent next year (after growing 18.9 percent in 2016). Although they comprise less than 1 percent of prescriptions, specialty drugs account for 35 percent of the prescription drug price trend, according to HR Consultancy Segal. Meanwhile, the overall cost of all drugs prescribed for employees under age 65 is expected to grow 11.6 percent next year, on top of an 11.3 percent hike this year. (Braverman, 10/24) Stat: FDA Official Warns Other Drug Makers Not To Copy Sarepta Any company that plans to mimic the approach taken by Sarepta Therapeutics to win regulatory approval of a drug should think twice. That was the blunt message delivered on Tuesday by a high-ranking US Food and Drug Administration official in the wake of simmering controversy over a recent decision to approve a Sarepta drug for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a rare and fatal disease. (Silverman, 10/20) Stat: Elizabeth Warren Criticizes Feds For A 'Shamefully Weak' Deal With Mylan For the third time this month, a US senator is harshly criticizing a deal that Mylan Pharmaceuticals reached with the US Department of Justice for shortchanging Medicaid over rebates for its EpiPen device, which sparked national outrage after a series of price hikes. In an Oct. 21 letter, Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) complained to US Attorney General Loretta Lynch that the $465 million settlement “fails to hold Mylan accountable” and is “shockingly soft on this corporate wrongdoer,” because Mylan did not admit any wrongdoing, none of its executives were penalized, and the company can deduct the payment from its corporate taxes. (Silverman, 10/24) Bloomberg: Senator Warren Says Mylan Settlement With DOJ ‘Shamefully Weak’ Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is the latest critic of the $465 million settlement that drugmaker Mylan NV said it reached with the federal government over Medicaid rebates for its EpiPen allergy shot. In a letter Friday to Attorney General Loretta Lynch, the Democratic senator wrote that her staff calculated Mylan underpaid Medicaid rebates by an estimated $530 million -- $65 million more than the settlement -- mostly because Mylan didn’t pay the required inflation rebate. Warren wrote the settlement with the Department of Justice is “shamefully weak” because it lacks criminal penalties or any incentive to “prevent drug companies from engaging in abusive schemes to defraud Medicaid and rip off taxpayers.” (Hopkins, 10/21) Stat: Senator Richard Burr, A Pharma Favorite, Gets Help From His Friends If you leave the American Tobacco Trail and drive east, past Dame’s Almost Famous Chicken & Waffles, Bullock’s Bar-B-Que, and the Truly Blessed Hair Salon, you will eventually come to the world’s largest research park. This 16-square-mile stretch of Piedmont pine forest is home to about 200 companies that develop drugs and devices, run clinical trials, and otherwise push the boundaries of bioscience. GlaxoSmithKline, Merck & Co., and Biogen all have offices here, as do other industry leaders and startups. This is Burr country. (Kaplan, 10/25) Stat: EpiPen Prescriptions Continue To Climb, But Market Share Dropped EpiPen may be a budget buster for some households, but new data indicates prescriptions for the allergy emergency device are outpacing last year’s figures. At the same time, though, more prescriptions were written recently for lower-cost alternatives and, as a result, last month marked the first time in three years that EpiPen’s share of prescriptions for such devices fell. The number of prescriptions written for the auto-injector in August rose 19 percent from the same month a year ago. Overall, the number of prescriptions are up 14 percent through September, compared with the same period in 2015. In fact, there were 40 percent more prescriptions written in the first nine months of this year compared with 2013, even as the price for EpiPen was rising, according to Athenahealth, which provides technology services to physicians. (Silverman, 10/25) Stat: Congressman Calls For Probe Into Valeant's Pricing Of Lead Poisoning Drug The huge increase in the price of a lifesaving lead poisoning treatment has prompted a Michigan lawmaker to call for a congressional investigation into Valeant Pharmaceuticals. Two years ago, the drug maker boosted the list price for Calcium EDTA by roughly 2,700 percent. After Valeant bought the drug in 2013 as part of a deal in which it took over another company, the list price for a package of vials started rising quickly. After being stable at $950, Valeant raised the price several times before closing out 2014 at more than $26,900. (Silverman, 10/21) The Fiscal Times: How Big Pharma Lobbyists Keep Medicare Drug Prices High  An analysis jointly published this week by the Center for Responsive Politics and FairWarning, a non-profit news organization, highlights the political clout exerted by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), a major industry group, and some of the largest U.S. drug companies. Since early 2003, the drug manufacturing industry spent more than $1.9 billion on lobbying members of Congress on Medicare Part D and other issues important to the industry. In just 2015 and the first half of this year, the industry’s lobbying bill was equivalent to spending $468,108 on every member of Congress, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. (Pianin, 10/20) Chicago Tribune: Drug Price Control? AbbVie, Takeda, Astellas Vote 'No' With Their Millions Three of the area's largest pharmaceutical companies are in the thick of an intense California-based battle over rising drug costs, a fight that could spread to Illinois and other states. AbbVie, Takeda and Astellas, along with other major drug companies, have contributed nearly $86 million toward an effort to defeat Proposition 61. That's an Election Day ballot referendum where voters decide yes or no about regulating prices of drugs purchased by some California agencies on behalf of 4.4 million people whose health care is covered by the state. (Reed, 10/21) The New York Times: Unicef Cuts Cost Of Vaccine That Protects Against 5 Diseases The United Nations Children’s Fund has made a deal with six vaccine manufacturers that will cut in half the price of a shot that protects children against five diseases, the fund announced last week. The deal will mean three years’ worth of vaccine at an average price of 84 cents a dose; buyers currently pay about $1.84, according to Unicef. (McNeil, 10/24) Columbus Dispatch: Middlemen Drive Up Prescription Drug Prices, Critics Say  The industry created to keep drug prices in check is capitalizing on a lack of government oversight to rake in huge profits — often at the expense of patients, health plans and pharmacies, critics say. Drugmakers such as Mylan have been the target of much consumer wrath after the cost of its EpiPen, used to treat potentially deadly reactions to food allergies and bee stings, rose by more than 500 percent in just a few years. But a lesser-known group of companies called pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, also play a critical role in driving up drug prices, said former state Rep. Tim Brown, a Bowling Green Republican. And not enough people know about it. (Pyle, 10/23) This is part of the KHN Morning Briefing, a summary of health policy coverage from major news organizations. Sign up for an email subscription.

If the results are positive it would represent a step forward in the treatment of Alzheimer's as well as a great parting gift for Lilly's chief executive John Lechleiter, who will retire at the end of the year after leading the company for eight years. There is no doubt that given the huge number of anti-amyloid drugs that have failed in trials solanezumab is a high-risk project, but Lilly's CEO-in-waiting David Ricks said that while it is possible that the drug will perform no better than placebo, he considers that the "least probable outcome". The company hasn't seen any preliminary data from the trial however. A win in the EXPEDITION3 trial could lead to rapid regulatory filings, said Ricks, and if approved could be a massive product for Lilly with analysts forecasting recently that sales could reach up to $7.5bn at peak. Many scientists continue to believe that amyloid is the main pathogenic factor responsible for the degenerative changes that occur in the brain during Alzheimer's, and if solanezumab does show any efficacy, it would be the first drug to support that hypothesis in a late-stage trial. Solanezumab failed to show a clear benefit in trials involving patients with more advanced Alzheimer's, but led to speculation that amyloid needs to be blocked early in the course of the disease in order to prevent the formation of plaques that seem to cause the neuronal damage that in turn leads to cognitive and memory decline. The company recently began another phase III trial of solanezumab in prodromal (very early) Alzheimer's that will have 2,500 subjects when fully enrolled. Results from that trial are due in 2021. Ricks said that if EXPEDITION3 is a bust the prodromal trial will probably be abandoned. The comments on solanezumab came during Lilly's third-quarter results call, in which it reported a sales increase of 5% to $5.2bn driven by new product launches. Among these, diabetes drugs Trulicity (dulaglutide) and Jardiance (empagliflozin) both saw solid sales gains that did not however meet analysts' expectations, while lung cancer therapy Cyramza (ramucirumab) fell 12% thanks to competition from immuno-oncology rivals, Merck & Co's Keytruda (pembrolizumab) and Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo (nivolumab). Initial sales of Taltz (ixekizumab), which was approved by the FDA in March for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, were $33m. The interleukin-17 (IL-17) inhibitor is chasing Novartis' Cosentyx (secukinumab), which has the same mechanism of action and made $301m in the third quarter.

Here’s my favorite fund. Thinkstock By Steven Goldberg, Contributing Columnist October 25, 2016 As the stock market begins to anticipate a Hillary Clinton victory on November 8, health care stocks have been sliding. Since the beginning of August, when Clinton started to boost her lead over Donald Trump in the polls after the two parties’ conventions, health care stocks in Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index have lost 7.6% while the S&P 500 itself dipped just 0.9%. SEE ALSO: 7 Battered Biotech Stocks to Buy While They Are Down The fear: that a Clinton administration would take steps to stem the rising prices of prescription medicines. The reality: Unless the Democrats win the White House and both houses of Congress, which looks unlikely, don’t expect any big changes in drug-pricing regulation. What’s more, even if Washington did take measures to force down drug prices, the tailwinds propelling health care companies forward are remarkably strong. That’s why health care has long been my favorite industry. Start with the baby boomers. The huge cohort born in the U.S. between 1946 and 1964 is rapidly aging and consuming increasing amounts of health care products and services. People over age 75 use three to four times as much health care as younger folks. Advertisement Then consider the impact of emerging markets. As economies such as China and India continue growing at a fast clip, they’re creating a vast new global middle class. And one of the first things new entrants into the middle class want is more and better health care. Innovation is bringing new treatments and cures for hitherto incurable diseases. Jean Hynes, manager of Vanguard Health Care (VGHCX), says an astonishing one-fifth of all the research and development being done by businesses is being conducted by the health care industry. Biotechnology is entering a “golden age” and producing most of the breakthroughs, says Hynes. Over the long term, health care stocks have delivered, well, healthy gains to investors. Over the past 10 years, the S&P Health Care index returned an annualized 9.6%--an average of 2.7 percentage points better per year than the S&P 500. (All returns are through October 21.) Yet health care stocks, as a whole, are currently cheaper than the overall market, thanks to the Hillary effect. The S&P Health Care index trades at about 15 times analysts’ consensus earnings estimates for the coming 12 months. The S&P 500 trades at 17 times estimated earnings. Advertisement What really wins me over to health care stocks is that they tend to perform well in both bull and bear markets. Health care has long been considered a defensive sector, relatively immune to the ebbs and flows of the economy’s cycles. Indeed, in the 2007-09 bear market, when the S&P 500 plunged 55.3%, the S&P Health Care index lost only 38.0%. Yet health care is also enjoying robust growth—for decades it has expanded at a faster pace than the overall U.S. economy. Vanguard Health Care is my favorite way to tap this sector. One reason is the experience of its manager. Hynes, who is with Wellington Management, has worked on the fund since 1993, became comanager in 2008 and has been its sole manager since the start of 2013. Hynes, 47, joined Wellington after graduating from Wellesley College. She’s backed by six analysts and four research associates, who include medical doctors and PhDs. The fund’s Investor share class, which requires a $3,000 minimum investment, charges a mere 0.36% per year in fees. If you can swing the $50,000 minimum or you use a discount broker with a lower minimum, then you’ll save a little with the fund’s Admiral share class (VGHAX), which charges 0.31% annually. The Investor share class has returned an annualized 10.4% over the past 10 years—an average of 0.8 percentage point per year more than the S&P Health Care index and 3.5 points per year more than the S&P 500. When you’re paying so little for such a first-class management team, I see little reason to look elsewhere. Advertisement Hynes believes we’re entering a period that will be marked by the emergence of big winners and big losers in drugs and biotech. Investors will “differentiate between the real innovators and the companies with older drugs that are losing patent protection,” she says. Hynes says that 85% of pills taken orally today are generics, and that percentage will only increase. The use of “biosimilars”—generic versions of drugs produced in biotech labs—will also continue to grow, she predicts. That has led her to make bigger bets on individual stocks than she had previously. The fund, which holds $48 billion in assets, has about 6% apiece of its assets in UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Allergan (AGN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), and 5% in both Merck (MRK), and AstraZeneca (AZN). Overall, the fund has more than 55% of its assets in what Hynes calls biopharma. She thinks it’s meaningless to distinguish between traditional pharmaceutical companies and biotech firms because they’re all involved in biotech research. Another 25% of the fund is in health care services, such as insurance, and the remainder, except for 3% in cash, is in medical devices. I asked Hynes where she sees the next big breakthroughs in medicine. “The most exciting,” she says is “progress in unraveling cancer. We’re seeing a tremendous amount of real breakthroughs.” Unfortunately, Hynes declined to discuss individual stocks. Advertisement She’s also surprisingly optimistic about new treatments for Alzheimer’s disease, which has so far defeated all efforts to cure it. Finally, she sees progress in treating some 50 rare diseases where the understanding of genetics has brought cures closer.
