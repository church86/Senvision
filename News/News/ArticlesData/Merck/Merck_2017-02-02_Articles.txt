The Merck Keynote 181 trial is now open at Sanford. The study is exploring the Merck drug pembrolizumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor that allows the body to recognize the cancer and use its immune system to clear the disease. Keynote 181 is open for patients with advanced esophageal cancer who have received two previous therapies. Participants, who must be at least 18, are required to provide a tissue biopsy. Sanford is also studying the application of pembrolizumab in other types of cancer under the Merck Investigator Studies Program, or MISP. The drug is FDA approved for melanoma and certain types of lung cancer. Sioux Falls oncologist Jonathan Bleeker, M.D., and Fargo-based oncologist Amit Panwalkar, M.D., are co-principal investigators for the study. “The immune system plays an important role in regulating the body, but those mechanisms become even more critical when the body needs to fight a disease like cancer,” said Bleeker. “Researchers, including our own at Sanford, have discovered that pembrolizumab can work in treating other types of cancer. Sanford and Merck recognized the need to study the potential of this drug in patients with esophageal cancer.” Keynote 181 is available in both Sioux Falls and Fargo and is open for 100 participants. For more information or to enroll, call 87-SURVIVAL. Sanford offers more than 20 clinical trials involving immunotherapy. For a complete list, visit sanfordhealth.org/clinicaltrials.

By Linda A. Johnson Associated Press  February 03, 2017 Profits at the drug maker Merck surged in the fourth quarter, and the company CEO told investors that a ‘‘constructive’’ meeting with President Trump focused on reducing taxes and relaxing regulations. Merck chief executive Kenneth Frazier said Thursday that he’s encouraged by an initial meeting he and other pharmaceutical executives had Tuesday with Trump, who has said drug makers have been ‘‘getting away with murder’’ on prices. Advertisement The pharmaceutical industry has come under fire in recent months over soaring drug prices, which have been blasted by patients, doctors, politicians, and others. Drug companies and investors have been alternatively worried that the Trump administration and Congress will move to reduce prices, and cheered by hopes that they will help them increase profits by reducing taxes and cutting regulations so they can bring new drugs to market faster. On a conference call to discuss financial results, Frazier told analysts the meeting with Trump focused on possible changes to US tax laws, removing ‘‘outdated’’ regulations, and using market forces to make medicines more affordable.

He said more meetings with Trump are expected, and that while he expects Congress to introduce bills calling for government price negotiations or controls, he doesn’t think that’s widely seen as a solution. Merck’s fourth quarter profit surged 21 percent on the strength of aggressive cost-cutting and sales of two new drugs, cancer medicine Keytruda and hepatitis C treatment Zepatier. Advertisement Keytruda is among the most successful of a new generation of cancer medicines that work by helping the immune system fight tumors. Launched in September 2014 for advanced skin cancer, Keytruda has since been approved for treating lung cancer — a much bigger market — plus head and neck cancer. Keytruda had sales of $483 million in the quarter and $1.4 billion over 2016, and could get US approval in March for two other tumor types. Edward Jones analyst Ashtyn Evans wrote to investors that she expects annual Keytruda sales to reach $7 billion by 2020. Zepatier was launched early last year in the crowded field of new drugs that cure hepatitis C. It brought in $229 million in fourth-quarter sales, putting it on pace to possibly hit $1 billion in sales this year. Strong sales of those and other drugs, plus the cost cuts, helped Merck overcome the ongoing drag of lower revenues from older drugs, especially ones that are starting to face competition from generics. That will continue, as a big-selling cholesterol drug, Vytorin, will soon face cheaper copycats. Merck, the country’s second-biggest drug maker, reported fourth-quarter net income of $1.18 billion, or 42 cents per share. Excluding one-time costs, earnings were 89 cents per share, a penny better than industry analysts had projected. Loading comments...

Merck & Co. reports financial results Thursday, Feb. 2, 2017. (AP Photo/Mel Evans, File) Profits at the drugmaker Merck surged in the fourth quarter, and the company CEO told investors that a “constructive” meeting with President Donald Trump focused on reducing taxes and relaxing regulations. Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier on Thursday said he’s encouraged by an initial meeting he and other pharmaceutical executives had Tuesday with Trump, who has said drugmakers have been “getting away with murder” on drug prices.

Drug companies and investors have been alternatively worried that the Trump administration and Congress will move to reduce prices, and cheered by hopes that they will help them increase profits by reducing taxes and reducing regulations so they can bring new drugs to market faster.

Merck, the country’s second-biggest drugmaker, reported fourth-quarter net income of $1.18 billion, or 42 cents per share. Excluding one-time costs, earnings were 89 cents per share, a penny better than industry analysts had projected. Sales dipped 1 percent to $10.12 billion, just shy of Wall Street forecasts for $10.2 billion. Merck shares jumped $1.75, or 3 percent, to $63.85 in midday trading. The Kenilworth, New Jersey, company expects full-year earnings in the range of $2.47 to $2.62 per share, with revenue of $38.6 billion to $40.1 billion – just a tad below what analysts were expecting. For all of 2016, Merck reported net income of $5.7 billion, or $2.04 per share, on revenue of $39.8 billion. BernsteinResearch analyst Tim Anderson called the 2017 forecasts “a relief,” given Merck’s prior cautionary language and what its rivals have been predicting for 2017.

JOHNSON, Associated Press Published: February 2, 2017, 3:05 PM A   A Profits at the drugmaker Merck surged in the fourth quarter, and the company CEO told investors that a “constructive” meeting with President Donald Trump focused on reducing taxes and relaxing regulations. Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier on Thursday said he’s encouraged by an initial meeting he and other pharmaceutical executives had Tuesday with Trump, who has said drugmakers have been “getting away with murder” on drug prices. The pharmaceutical industry has come under fire in recent months over soaring drug prices, which have been blasted by patients, doctors, politicians and others. Drug companies and investors have been alternatively worried that the Trump administration and Congress will move to reduce prices, and cheered by hopes that they will help them increase profits by reducing taxes and reducing regulations so they can bring new drugs to market faster.

JOHNSON AP Medical Writer Feb 2, 2017 Updated 13 hrs ago 0 Mel Evans FILE - This Thursday, Dec. 18, 2014, file photo shows the Merck logo on a stained glass panel at a Merck company building in Kenilworth, N.J. Merck & Co. reports financial results Thursday, Feb. 2, 2017. (AP Photo/Mel Evans, File) Profits at the drugmaker Merck surged in the fourth quarter, and the company CEO told investors that a "constructive" meeting with President Donald Trump focused on reducing taxes and relaxing regulations. Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier on Thursday said he's encouraged by an initial meeting he and other pharmaceutical executives had Tuesday with Trump, who has said drugmakers have been "getting away with murder" on drug prices. The pharmaceutical industry has come under fire in recent months over soaring drug prices, which have been blasted by patients, doctors, politicians and others. Drug companies and investors have been alternatively worried that the Trump administration and Congress will move to reduce prices, and cheered by hopes that they will help them increase profits by reducing taxes and reducing regulations so they can bring new drugs to market faster. On a conference call to discuss Merck's latest financial results, Frazier told analysts the meeting with Trump focused on possible changes to U.S. tax laws, removing "outdated" regulations and using market forces to make medicines more affordable. "What I heard from Mr. Trump was a concern less around the costs of drugs in the aggregate," and more about affordability for patients and finding a way for them to share in the sizeable discounts insurers and other payers negotiate with drugmakers, Frazier said. He said more meetings with Trump are expected, and that while he expects Congress to introduce bills calling for government price negotiations or controls, he doesn't think that's widely seen as a solution. Merck's fourth quarter profit surged 21 percent on the strength of aggressive cost-cutting and sales of two new drugs, the cancer medicine Keytruda and the hepatitis C treatment Zepatier. Keytruda is among the most successful of a new generation of cancer medicines that work by helping the immune system fight tumors. Launched in September 2014 for advanced skin cancer, Keytruda has since been approved for treating lung cancer — a much bigger market — plus head and neck cancer. Keytruda had sales of $483 million in the quarter and $1.4 billion over 2016, and could get U.S. approval in March for two other tumor types. Edward Jones analyst Ashtyn Evans wrote to investors that she expects annual Keytruda sales to reach $7 billion by 2020. Zepatier was launched early last year in the crowded field of new drugs that cure hepatitis C. It brought in $229 million in fourth-quarter sales, putting it on pace to possibly hit $1 billion in sales this year. Strong sales of those and other drugs, plus the cost cuts, helped Merck overcome the ongoing drag of lower revenues from older drugs, especially ones that are starting to face competition from generics, like the cholesterol pill Zetia and the allergy spray Nasonex. That will continue, as a big-selling cholesterol drug, Vytorin, will soon face cheaper copycats. Merck, the country's second-biggest drugmaker, reported fourth-quarter net income of $1.18 billion, or 42 cents per share. Excluding one-time costs, earnings were 89 cents per share, a penny better than industry analysts had projected. Sales dipped 1 percent to $10.12 billion, just shy of Wall Street forecasts for $10.2 billion. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

Merck shares jumped $1.75, or 3 percent, to $63.85 in midday trading. The Kenilworth, New Jersey, company expects full-year earnings in the range of $2.47 to $2.62 per share, with revenue of $38.6 billion to $40.1 billion — just a tad below what analysts were expecting. For all of 2016, Merck reported net income of $5.7 billion, or $2.04 per share, on revenue of $39.8 billion. BernsteinResearch analyst Tim Anderson called the 2017 forecasts "a relief," given Merck's prior cautionary language and what its rivals have been predicting for 2017. ___ Follow Linda A.

Strong sales of those and other drugs, plus the cost cuts, helped Merck overcome the ongoing drag of lower revenues from older drugs, especially ones that are starting to face competition from generics, like the cholesterol pill Zetia and the allergy spray Nasonex. That will continue, as a big-selling cholesterol drug, Vytorin, will soon face cheaper copycats. Merck, the country's second-biggest drugmaker, reported fourth-quarter net income of $1.18 billion, or 42 cents per share. Excluding one-time costs, earnings were 89 cents per share, a penny better than industry analysts had projected. Sales dipped 1 percent to $10.12 billion, just shy of Wall Street forecasts for $10.2 billion. Merck shares jumped $1.75, or 3 percent, to $63.85 in midday trading. The Kenilworth, New Jersey, company expects full-year earnings in the range of $2.47 to $2.62 per share, with revenue of $38.6 billion to $40.1 billion — just a tad below what analysts were expecting. For all of 2016, Merck reported net income of $5.7 billion, or $2.04 per share, on revenue of $39.8 billion. BernsteinResearch analyst Tim Anderson called the 2017 forecasts "a relief," given Merck's prior cautionary language and what its rivals have been predicting for 2017.

Mead Johnson is best known for its Enfamil range of baby foods Alan Tovey 2 February 2017 • 4:14pm It’s the deal that analysts and investors have been waiting for Reckitt Benckiser boss Rakesh Kapoor to make for years. The FTSE 100 company confirmed on Thursday morning that it was in “advanced talks” with Mead Johnson to buy the US-based producer of baby milk for almost $17bn (£13.1bn). Kapoor has made no secret of the fact that he’s been on the lookout for acquisitions since losing out to Germany’s Bayer in 2014 in a fight to acquire the consumer healthcare unit of Merck. The €14.2bn price Bayer paid was too rich for Kapoor’s blood, who said at the time his company was “a highly disciplined acquirer with strict return metrics, which we will not break”. Reckitt boss Rakesh Kapoor has said he is ready to make acquisitions Credit: Bloomberg But even then, he signalled that he was on hunt for other opportunities, adding that “the consumer health market remains highly fragmented and we will continue to evaluate opportunities that fit both our strategic and financial criteria". It seems that he has finally pounced, with the negotiations around a potential $90 a share offer - representing a premium of 30pc on the current share price. Should an offer materialise, it will be financed through a combination of cash and debt. What is Mead Johnson? The company is a big player in nutrition products for infants, children and expectant mothers. And it is big - it has about 14pc of the worldwide baby food market, not far behind Nestlé, which has just over 20pc. The baby food market itself is massive. A recent report by Zion Market Research valued it at $53.3bn in 2015, and forecast it will grow to $76.5bn by 2021. Johnson Mead had revenues of $4.1bn in 2015 and made a pre-tax profit of $871m. Why is Reckitt Benckiser interested? The FTSE 100 group is looking for growth and has the financial firepower to buy it. It’s made some acquisitions over the past few years but Mead would be a real game changer, and move the company into a new - and massive - market. Reckitt is best known for its Dettol, Durex, Scholl, Harpic and Vanish products - it calls them its “power brands” - along with its over-the-counter (OTC), non-prescription products such as Nurofen. Buying Mead would broaden Reckitt’s horizons. Reckitt Benckiser is best known for its household brands Cynics might argue that Kapoor wants - or even needs - a big deal after losing out on Merck. Reckitt had much to gain from the Merck deal: the acquisition would have made it the world’s third-largest purveyor of OTC healthcare products, and would have generated cost savings in production and sales. Why break out of the markets Reckitt knows? It might not have any other choice, according to Credit Suisse analysts, who said in a note that while the target is “most certainly a surprise and rather left-field [it is] perhaps not fully off the beaten track. Adding infant milk formula was not what we were expecting but there were no obvious OTC assets to tackle”. UBS analyst Pinar Ergun echoed the sentiment, expressing “surprise” at Mead being singled out. However UBS had previously flagged that Reckitt “could consider M&A outside OTC”. She added that Mead was “not a natural fit for Reckitt and will need to convince the market of the rationale for the deal”. Ms Ergun did see some positives: “Critics are likely to argue that Reckitt is desperate to do deals, pointing out the scarcity of core health/hygiene assets on offer. We take a more balanced view: Reckitt management's strong track record in balancing growth/margins could go down well at Mead, and the long-term category dynamics are attractive.” Reckitt Benckiser 1-year share price Any other factors to consider? Reckitt is facing headwinds in emerging markets, while many developed ones are facing pressures that are holding back growth. Buying Mead could alleviate some of these - 50pc of Mead’s sales are in Asia and 17pc in South America, and UBS has made a rough calculation that the deal could boost earnings per share by 10pc in its first year. Synergies would also likely be created in a combination, though Credit Suisse sees few “obvious ones outside of head office and maybe a little distribution”. Reckitt’s management has a strong M&A track record so they could well find more. Can Reckitt afford it? Easily. The company - which has a market value of £49bn - had revenues last year of £8.8bn, made a profit of £2.2bn, and has debt of only £1.6bn. A purchase would push its debt ratio up from 0.6 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to 3.5 times - far from unmanageable. Is it a good price? A $90 a share price implies a valuation of 18.3 before synergies, according to Liberum. This is lower than the 21.7 times Danone paid for Numico and closer to the 15.7 times Nestlé paid for Gerber and the 19.8 times it paid for Wyeth Nutrition. Mead shares are down about a quarter over the past six months, so Reckitt could have swooped now to take advantage of their weakness. Is anyone else in the running? Before Reckitt emerged, Danone was seen as the most likely buyer, though the French business might be too busy with integration of previous acquisitions. Nestlé would seem a natural fit but the market dominance it would achieve buying Mead would be a regulatory minefield. Other outsiders could include Unilever, a Chinese buyer or even a major pharma group. But no one has broken cover yet. Sell to buy? Kapoor’s admission that he is focused on consumer health products could indicate that he will sell off some other products to help get the deal away, but if he does it certainly won’t be to help finance a deal. When will it take place if they agree a sale? It’s hard to say but the fact that Reckitt says negotiations are “advanced” indicated that it has done a very thorough examination of Mead’s finances and thinks it can make a go of it, implying the FTSE 100 giant is not hanging about. There's big money in baby formula Earning his money Kapoor is one of the country’s best rewarded executives with a £23m pay deal. He’s motivated to do something transformational to earn that salary and has faced investor disquiet over his earnings in the past. A funny thing Normally when a potential deal is revealed, the buyer’s shares fall and the target’s rise. Reckitt’s shares were up 4pc in midday trading, in what Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets suggested could be recognition that the acquisition implies “better growth and higher margins for a behemoth stuck in a rut”. A big deal According to figures from Datalogic, Reckitt buying Mead would be the second largest acquisition in the past year of US company by a British one. It’s beaten only by the mammoth - and still pending - purchase by British American Tobacco of the 58pc of Reynolds American it does not own, which is valued at $60bn. It’s more than double Micro Focus’s still-to-complete purchase of HP Enterprise for $8.8bn, and Melrose buying Nortek for for $2.8bn.

By EmmaCourt Reporter Merck & Co.’s HPV vaccine Gardasil drove its vaccine business growth in the fourth quarter, bringing in $542 million of the unit’s about $700 million. The results beat Wall Street expectations by nearly $90 million and made Gardasil and the newer, more expensive Gardasil 9 among a handful of top Merck MRK, +3.35%  products with year-over-year growth in the latest quarter. But Gardasil also has an ax hanging over it: a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation that teenagers ages 15 and under need only two doses of the three-dose regimen. The two-dose regimen should have a “rapid transition” this year, Chief Financial Officer Robert Davis said on the company’s earnings call, and “that will have a negative impact on sales in the U.S.,” echoing comments made after third-quarter results but providing no further detail. Increased pricing and demand drove Gardasil fourth-quarter sales growth, which amounted to a 9% increase from the year-earlier period, Merck said. See more: Merck matches profit expectations but sales come up a bit short A spokesperson told MarketWatch that the referred-to price increase occurred in August and that no price increase has been taken since the CDC’s recommendation last fall. Related: Gardasil propelled Merck to a strong third quarter — but don’t expect that to last The shift to Gardasil 9, which prevents against more types of HPV than Gardasil and is more expensive, has also lifted Merck. The company said it expects the franchise to continue to perform well despite impending U.S. changes. According to Merck, Gardasil 9 has cost about $190 per syringe since August. List prices don’t necessarily reflect the price paid by health insurers, since substantial discounts are typically negotiated, but they are the only publicly available drug price data. Though Gardasil was a notable source of revenue for Merck in the fourth quarter, those results pale in comparison with the prior quarter. Sales of Gardasil and Gardasil 9 were about $860 million, a 38% increase from the year-earlier period, and drove the company’s earnings and revenue beat.

Shares of Merck were up nearly 3 percent at $63.90 after the U.S. drugmaker also reported fourth-quarter earnings that matched analysts' expectations. Despite acknowledging a need to hold down costs, Merck said it was charging ahead with Keytruda development, with about 430 studies ongoing in a wide variety of cancers and combinations with other therapies. Merck forecast 2017 earnings of $3.72 to $3.87 per share, excluding special items. Analysts on average were expecting $3.85 per share. The company gave a revenue outlook of $38.6 billion to $40.1 billion, compared with analysts' expectations of $40.04 billion. "We are actually implying EPS growth despite the headwinds of loss of exclusivity and (foreign exchange) and the other challenges that we face," Chief Executive Officer Ken Frazier told analysts on a conference call. Merck expects unfavorable foreign exchange rates to sap 2 percent from 2017 global sales. Frazier said Merck was in the market for deals to augment its early to mid-stage drug development pipeline if the price is right. Such moves are not contingent on tax reform or changes to U.S. healthcare laws being discussed by President Trump and Congress, he added. In 2017, Merck will face generic competition for cholesterol drugs Zetia and Vytorin, antibiotic Cubicin and its Nasonex nasal spray in the United States and for Remicade, its big-selling arthritis drug, in Europe. But the U.S. drugmaker is confident it can solidify its leading position for Keytruda in lung cancer, by far the largest oncology market, and that it has the potential to become a foundational therapy in other cancers as well. Last summer Merck leapfrogged Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) as the perceived leader in the market for potentially game-changing drugs that spur the immune system to fight cancer, when Keytruda extended survival among previously untreated lung cancer patients. Bristol's rival drug, Opdivo, failed to do so. Keytruda is now approved as a first-option treatment for non-small cell lung cancer patients whose tumor cells display a high level of the PD-L1 protein the drug targets, as well as for patients whose cancer has progressed after other treatments. Merck said there has been a significant acceleration of PD-L1 testing, a clear indication of heightened interest in use of Keytruda in first-line lung cancer. In May, Merck may also get U.S. approval for Keytruda with chemotherapy in first-line lung cancer, opening it up to many more potential patients. Edward Jones healthcare analyst Ashtyn Evans forecast annual Keytruda sales would reach $7 billion by 2020. She said there was relief that Merck's 2017 forecast was not lower "because they really need to put a significant amount of investment behind Keytruda." Fourth-quarter Keytruda sales more than doubled from a year earlier to $483 million, with 40 percent coming from melanoma, its initial approval, and 30 percent from lung cancer. Sales of diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet grew 4 percent to $1.5 billion despite intensifying competition.

Merck forecast 2017 earnings of $3.72 to $3.87 per share, excluding special items. Analysts on average were expecting $3.85 per share. The company gave a revenue outlook of $38.6 billion to $40.1 billion, compared with analysts' expectations of $40.04 billion. "We are actually implying EPS growth despite the headwinds of loss of exclusivity and (foreign exchange) and the other challenges that we face," Chief Executive Officer Ken Frazier told analysts on a conference call. Merck expects unfavorable foreign exchange rates to sap 2 percent from 2017 global sales. Frazier said Merck was in the market for deals to augment its early to mid-stage drug development pipeline if the price is right. Such moves are not contingent on tax reform or changes to U.S. healthcare laws being discussed by President Trump and Congress, he added. In 2017, Merck will face generic competition for cholesterol drugs Zetia and Vytorin, antibiotic Cubicin and its Nasonex nasal spray in the United States and for Remicade, its big-selling arthritis drug, in Europe. But the U.S. drugmaker is confident it can solidify its leading position for Keytruda in lung cancer, by far the largest oncology market, and that it has the potential to become a foundational therapy in other cancers as well. Last summer Merck leapfrogged Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) as the perceived leader in the market for potentially game-changing drugs that spur the immune system to fight cancer, when Keytruda extended survival among previously untreated lung cancer patients. Bristol's rival drug, Opdivo, failed to do so. Keytruda is now approved as a first-option treatment for non-small cell lung cancer patients whose tumor cells display a high level of the PD-L1 protein the drug targets, as well as for patients whose cancer has progressed after other treatments. Merck said there has been a significant acceleration of PD-L1 testing, a clear indication of heightened interest in use of Keytruda in first-line lung cancer. In May, Merck may also get U.S. approval for Keytruda with chemotherapy in first-line lung cancer, opening it up to many more potential patients. Edward Jones healthcare analyst Ashtyn Evans forecast annual Keytruda sales would reach $7 billion by 2020. She said there was relief that Merck's 2017 forecast was not lower "because they really need to put a significant amount of investment behind Keytruda." Fourth-quarter Keytruda sales more than doubled from a year earlier to $483 million, with 40 percent coming from melanoma, its initial approval, and 30 percent from lung cancer. Sales of diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet grew 4 percent to $1.5 billion despite intensifying competition.

Merck's results were impacted by a stronger dollar, as well as the loss of market exclusivity on certain drugs. Facebook — Facebook reported adjusted quarterly profit of $1.41 per share, 10 cents above estimates, while revenue also came in above forecasts. The social media giant continues to benefit from gaining traction in mobile use and video. Separately, Facebook was ordered to pay $500 million to video game publisher ZeniMax, which had accused Facebook of stealing its virtual reality technology. Becton Dickinson — The medical supplies maker reported adjusted quarterly profit of $2.33 per share, 21 cents above estimates. Revenue also beat forecasts, and the company raised its full-year 2017 earnings outlook as well. Cigna — The insurance company beat forecasts by 13 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.87 per share, with revenue also above forecasts. The company's 2017 earnings outlook does fall below consensus estimates, but Cigna said it is pleased with the positive momentum it's seeing for the year ahead. Macy's — The retailer's shares are higher following a New York Post report that CEO Terry Lundgren is open to friendly buyout offers, hoping to avoid a board shakeup that activist investor Starboard Value is demanding. Delphi Automotive — The auto parts maker reported adjusted quarterly profit of $1.83 per share, 23 cents above estimates, while revenue also exceeded forecasts. Delphi is benefiting from its increasing involvement in self-driving car technology. Estee Lauder — The beauty products maker beat estimates by 5 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.22 per share, but revenue was below Street forecasts as well as its full-year 2017 outlook. Abercrombie & Fitch — Abercrombie promoted merchandising chief Fran Horowitz to chief executive officer. A team led by Executive Chairman Arthur Martinez had led the teen apparel retailer since the departure of Michael Jeffries in 2014. Allstate — Allstate reported adjusted quarterly profit of $2.17 per share, well above estimates of $1.63, though the insurer's revenue was very slightly below Street forecasts. Allstate was helped by a decline in casualty losses. MetLife — MetLife came in 6 cents shy of estimates with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.28 per share, and revenue also missed estimates. The insurance company's results were impacted by losses in its hedging program amid a rise in interest rates near the end of the year. Edwards Lifesciences — Edwards beat estimates by 3 cents, reporting adjusted quarterly profit of 75 cents per share. The medical equipment maker also beat on the top line, and gave upbeat earnings guidance for the full year. Edwards is seeing significant growth for its heart valve replacement systems. Tractor Supply — The company reported quarterly profit of 94 cents per share, 2 cents above estimates, with revenue also beating forecasts. The retailer of farming and ranching supplies gave a mixed outlook for the full year, although it is seeing positive momentum in same-store sales after a string of declines. Shutterfly — Shutterfly fell 21 cents shy of estimates with quarterly earnings of $2.63, and the online photo service's revenue missed as well. The company also gave a weaker than expected outlook. Mead Johnson Nutrition — Mead Johnson is in talks to be bought by British consumer goods maker Reckitt Benckiser for $16.7 billion, or $90 per share. Both companies have confirmed the discussions, and Reckitt said it would finance the proposed deal with cash and debt. Deutsche Bank — Deutsche Bank reported a bigger-than-expected loss for the final quarter of 2016, with the German bank failing to match the strong rebound in bond trading posted by its rivals. Nokia — Nokia posted better than expected profits for the fourth quarter. The maker of networking equipment was helped by cost cuts as well as the acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent. Sony — Sony cut its full year profit outlook, following a $1 billion writedown for the company's movie business. JPMorgan Chase — JPMorgan appointed business banking head Jennifer Piepszak as chief executive of its card services division. Costco — The warehouse retailer reported a comparable store sales increase of 7 percent for January, beating consensus estimates of a 3.9 percent rise. Symantec — Symantec earned an adjusted 32 cents per share for its latest quarter, 4 cents above estimates, though the antivirus software maker's revenue was slightly below forecasts. Overall quarterly profit was down 34 percent over a year earlier on costs related to the acquisition of Blue Coat Systems last year.

Martin Baccardax Feb 2, 2017 7:11 AM EST Merck (MRK) posted fourth-quarter earnings that were largely in line with estimates but issued a cautious outlook for the year and sees worldwide sales largely flat when compared to 2016. Non-GAAP earnings for the three months ended in December were 89 cents a share, meeting analysts' forecasts and falling 4.3% from the same period last year. Group revenue, Merck said, was $10.1 billion, modestly shy of the $10.22 billion estimate.  Sales of the company's key Keytruda drug, however, beat forecasts, rising 125% from the same period last year to $483 million, well ahead of the $470 million figure forecasts by analysts. "The performance of Merck's broad and balanced portfolio allows us to remain committed to biomedical innovation that saves and improves lives and delivers long-term value to shareholders," said CEO Ken Frazier. "The momentum behind our pipeline and key product launches, including the continued growth and expansion of Keytruda into new indications and markets around the world, further reinforces our company's strategic direction." Merck said it expects to see full-year 2017 EPS of between $3.72 and $3.87 on sales of between $38.8 billion and $40.1 billion, "including an approximately 2% negative impact from foreign exchange." Full-year 2016 sales were $39.8 billion, the company said. Merck rival Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) said on Jan. 19 it would not seek accelerated approval for a combination of its Opdivo and Yervoy drugs as a treatment for newly diagnosed lung cancer. On Jan. 10, Merck announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has accepted and is reviewing an application for Keytruda plus chemotherapy for first-line treatment of patients that have metastatic or advanced non-squamous NSCLC, regardless of the levels of the PD-L1 protein, and with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. A decision is expected on or before May 10.

Like this story, share it with millions of investors on M3 Glenmark Q3 net soars 143% to Rs 477 cr aided by US generic biz The US business that constitutes close to half of Glenmark’s business doubled to Rs.1230.8 crore led by new launches including generic version of Zetia - that has 180-day exclusivity. Post Your Comments Share Cancel Viswanath Pilla Moneycontrol Glenmark Pharmaceuticals on Thursday posted a 143 percent increase in its third quarter net profit for FY17. It beat analyst estimates on the back of strong performance of its formulation business in US aided by 180-day marketing exclusivity of generic Zetia. Glenmark’s net profit rose to Rs 477 crore for the quarter in question compared to the previous year’s Rs 196.2 crore. Revenues rose 43 percent to Rs 2535.08 crore. A CNBC-TV18 analysts poll predicted the net profit at Rs 303 crore, and net sales at Rs 2,372 crore. The US business that constitutes close to half of Glenmark’s business doubled to Rs 1230.8 crore led by new launches including Ezetimibe - which has a 180-day exclusivity. Ezetimibe used in the treatment of high cholesterol is the generic version of Merck-Schering Plough’s Zetia. Glenmark settled the patent litigation with Merck in May 2010. As per the settlement, the company can launch the drug in December 2016 for 134 days of sole exclusivity, ahead of the April 25, 2017 expiry of Merck’s patent exclusivity for Zetia. Glenmark has a licensing partnership with Par Pharmaceutical, a subsidiary Endo. Analysts expect the company to make USD 200-250 million from Zetia in 6 months. The company also launched dermatological products Nystatin and Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream and Triamcinolone Acetonide, in addition to Potassium Chloride Extended-Release tablets to treat low blood levels. The company filed five ANDA applications with the US FDA in the third quarter, and plans to file an additional 10 applications in the forthcoming quarter. The total number of ANDAs filed during this year was eleven. Glenmark’s marketing portfolio through December 31, 2016 consists of 112 generic products authorized for distribution in the US market. The company currently has 63 applications pending in various stages of the approval process with the US FDA, of which 24 are Paragraph IV applications. Glenmark’s US portfolio consists of over 100 generic products authorized for distribution. The company currently has 62 ANDAs in various stages of the approval process with the US FDA. India, the company’s second largest market, grew at modest 5.9 percent to Rs 516.9 crore due to the impact of demonetization and price controls. Around a quarter of Glenmark’s Indian formulation portfolio comes under NLEM, the company said. The European business grew 11 percent to Rs 195.7 crore on the back of new launches in UK and Germany. The company said it won new drug supply contracts in Germany. The rest of the world (ROW) business that includes Russia grew 6 percent to Rs.251 crore. Glenmark’s Latin American sales declined 23.4 percent to Rs 156 crore, as the Venezuela subsidiary’s sales dropped significantly, and even its other markets such as Brazil and Mexico did not perform well. Glenmark has about USD 50 million stuck in the bank account of its subsidiary in Venezuela, as it is facing challenges to repatriate the money it earned through sales. The South American country has controls over transferring dollars earned as income there. Revenue from sale of API to regulated and semi-regulated markets globally grew 33 percent to Rs 192 crore – largely aided by supplies of Olmesartan API ingredients to Mylan, which had 180-day marketing exclusivity. Glenmark filed for two drug master files in US during the third quarter. “The overall growth for the organization has been bolstered due to the strong performance by our US formulation business. It was further aided by the good performance from our API business too. In India, considering the overall demand environment, the business still managed to record sales growth.” said Glenn Saldanha, Chairman & MD, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Limited. He further added, “During the quarter, we announced our Strategic Blueprint for the Next Decade where the organization’s focus will be directed to three therapeutic areas namely; Oncology, Respiratory and Dermatology. Also, our innovative pipeline continues to make good progress primarily on account of the Bi-specific Antibodies which are in clinical or pre-clinical development stage.” Shares of Glenmark rose 0.98 percent to close at Rs.907.95 on BSE, the benchmark Sensex gained 0.30 percent to end at 28,226.61 points.

Frazier, chairman and chief executive officer, Merck. “The momentum behind our pipeline and key product launches, including the continued growth and expansion of KEYTRUDA into new indications and markets around the world, further reinforces our company’s strategic direction.” Financial Summary $ in millions, except EPS amounts   Fourth Quarter   Year Ended   Dec. 31,   Dec. 31, 2016 2015 2016 2015 Sales $10,115 $10,215 $39,807 $39,498 GAAP EPS 0.42 0.35 2.04 1.56 Non-GAAP EPS that excludes certain items1* 0.89 0.93 3.78 3.59 GAAP net income2 1,177 976 5,691 4,442 Non-GAAP net income that excludes certain items1,2*   2,470   2,608   10,538   10,195 *Refer to table on page 8. Worldwide sales were $10.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016, a decrease of 1 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2015, including a 1 percent negative impact from foreign exchange. Sales in the fourth quarter of 2016 reflect the unfavorable impact of approximately $150 million of sales in Japan, which occurred in the third quarter of 2016 rather than in the fourth quarter due to the implementation of a resource planning system. Full-year 2016 worldwide sales were $39.8 billion, an increase of 1 percent compared with the full year of 2015, including a 2 percent negative impact from foreign exchange. GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings per share assuming dilution (EPS) were $0.42 for the fourth quarter and $2.04 for the full year of 2016. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.89 for the fourth quarter and $3.78 for the full year of 2016 excludes acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, restructuring costs and certain other items, which include a charge to settle the worldwide KEYTRUDA patent litigation. Pipeline Highlights Merck significantly advanced the clinical development program for KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab), an anti-PD-1 therapy. The FDA approved a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for KEYTRUDA for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression (Tumor Proportion Score [TPS] of 50 Percent or More) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. The FDA granted Priority Review for three additional sBLAs for KEYTRUDA, including: Use in combination with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for patients with metastatic or advanced NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 expression and with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. The PDUFA action date is May 10, 2017. The treatment of previously treated patients with advanced microsatellite instability-high cancer. The PDUFA action date is March 8, 2017. The treatment of patients with refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) or for patients with cHL who have relapsed after three or more prior lines of therapy. The PDUFA action date is March 15, 2017. KEYTRUDA received Breakthrough Therapy Designations from the FDA for the second-line treatment of patients with urothelial carcinoma with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy and for the treatment of patients with primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma that is refractory to or has relapsed after two prior lines of therapy. The European Commission approved KEYTRUDA for the first-line treatment of metastatic NSCLC in adults whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression (TPS of 50 percent or more) with no EGFR or ALK positive tumor mutations. KEYTRUDA was approved in Japan as a first- and second-line treatment of certain patients with PD-L1-positive unresectable advanced/recurrent NSCLC. Merck and Incyte Corporation recently announced the expansion of the clinical development program investigating KEYTRUDA in combination with epacadostat, Incyte’s investigational oral selective IDO1 inhibitor, to include pivotal studies for NSCLC, renal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. The company recently completed enrollment in its Phase 3 APECS study (NCT01953601) evaluating the safety and efficacy of verubecestat (MK-8931) in people with prodromal, or mild, Alzheimer’s disease. Estimated primary completion date for the trial is February 2019.

The decline was driven primarily by the loss of U.S. market exclusivity in 2016 for CUBICIN (daptomycin for injection), an I.V. antibiotic; NASONEX (mometasone furoate monohydrate), an inhaled nasal corticosteroid for the treatment of nasal allergy symptoms; and ZETIA (ezetimibe), a medicine for lowering LDL cholesterol; as well as by the ongoing impact of biosimilar competition in the company’s marketing territories in Europe for REMICADE (infliximab), a treatment for inflammatory diseases. In the aggregate, sales of these products declined $564 million during the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. These declines were largely offset by growth in oncology, hepatitis C, diabetes and vaccines, which include the ongoing launches of KEYTRUDA and ZEPATIER (elbasvir and grazoprevir), a medicine for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus genotypes 1 or 4 infection. Additionally, the ongoing launch of BRIDION (sugammadex) Injection 100 mg/mL, a medicine for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium bromide or vecuronium bromide in adults undergoing surgery, generated sales of $139 million during the fourth quarter of 2016. Growth of KEYTRUDA reflects the company’s continued efforts to launch the product with new indications, particularly as a first-line treatment for NSCLC and for previously treated recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer in the United States, and as a second-line treatment for NSCLC globally. ZEPATIER sales growth was primarily driven by the ongoing launch in the United States, as well as ongoing launches in emerging markets and the launches in Europe and Japan. In the fourth quarter of 2016, sales of ZEPATIER were $229 million. Pharmaceutical sales also reflect an increase in the diabetes franchise of JANUVIA (sitagliptin) and JANUMET (sitagliptin and metformin HCl), medicines that help lower blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes, driven by sales growth in the United States, partially offset by lower sales in Japan due to the timing of shipments. Growth in vaccines resulted from higher sales of PNEUMOVAX 23 (pneumococcal vaccine polyvalent) in the United States due to the adoption of recently issued vaccination guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and GARDASIL 9 (Human Papillomavirus 9-valent Vaccine, Recombinant) and GARDASIL [Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent (Types 6, 11, 16, and 18) Vaccine, Recombinant], vaccines to prevent certain cancers and other diseases caused by HPV, due to increased pricing and demand in the United States. On Dec. 31, 2016, Merck and Sanofi Pasteur ended the Sanofi Pasteur MSD vaccines joint venture. As a result, beginning in 2017, Merck will operate its vaccines business in Europe and will record vaccine sales in the 19 European countries previously part of the joint venture. In April 2017 the company will lose market exclusivity in the United States for VYTORIN (ezetimibe/simvastatin), a medicine for lowering LDL cholesterol, and anticipates a significant decline in U.S. VYTORIN sales thereafter. Full-year 2016 U.S. sales of VYTORIN were $473 million. Full-year 2016 pharmaceutical sales increased 1 percent to $35.2 billion, including a 1 percent negative impact from foreign exchange. Growth was driven by sales in oncology, vaccines and hepatitis C products, partially offset by sales declines of $887 million due to the loss of U.S. market exclusivity for NASONEX and CUBICIN, and the impact of biosimilar competition for REMICADE in the company’s marketing territories in Europe. Animal Health Revenue Animal Health sales totaled $884 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 6 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2015, including a 1 percent negative impact from foreign exchange. Worldwide sales for the full year of 2016 were $3.5 billion, an increase of 4 percent, including a 4 percent negative impact from foreign exchange. Sales growth in both periods was primarily driven by an increase in sales of companion animal products, particularly the BRAVECTO (fluralaner) line of products that kill fleas and ticks in dogs and cats for up to 12 weeks.

The increase in gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2016 was primarily driven by lower acquisition- and divestiture-related costs and restructuring costs noted above, which negatively affected gross margin by 7.7 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with 12.5 percentage points for the fourth quarter of 2015. The gross margin was 65.1 percent for the full year of 2016 compared to 62.2 percent for the full year of 2015. The increase in gross margin for the full year of 2016 was primarily driven by lower acquisition- and divestiture-related costs and restructuring costs, which negatively affected gross margin by 10.6 percentage points in the full year of 2016 compared with 13.2 percentage points for the full year of 2015. Marketing and administrative expenses were $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016, a 1 percent decrease compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. The decline primarily reflects lower acquisition- and divestiture-related costs. Full-year 2016 marketing and administrative expenses were $9.8 billion, a 5 percent decrease compared to the full year of 2015. The decline reflects lower acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, the favorable impact of foreign exchange and lower direct selling costs. Research and development (R&D) expenses were $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016, a 4 percent decrease compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. The decline reflects a reduction in expenses resulting from a decrease in the estimated fair value of liabilities for contingent consideration, partially offset by higher in-process research and development (IPR&D) impairment charges. R&D expenses were $7.2 billion for the full year of 2016, a 7 percent increase compared to the full year of 2015. The increase primarily reflects higher IPR&D impairment charges, clinical development spending and restructuring costs, partially offset by a reduction in expenses resulting from a decrease in the estimated fair value of liabilities for contingent consideration. Other (income) expense, net, was $721 million of expense in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $905 million of expense in the fourth quarter of 2015 and was $810 million of expense for the full year of 2016 compared to $1.5 billion of expense for the full year of 2015. Other (income) expense, net for the fourth quarter and full year of 2016 includes a $625 million charge to settle the worldwide KEYTRUDA patent litigation. Other (income) expense, net for the fourth quarter and full year of 2015 includes $161 million and $876 million, respectively, of foreign exchange losses related to the devaluation of the company’s net monetary assets in Venezuela and a $680 million net charge to settle the Vioxx shareholder class action litigation. GAAP EPS was $0.42 for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with $0.35 for the fourth quarter of 2015. GAAP EPS was $2.04 for the full year of 2016 compared with $1.56 for the full year of 2015. Non-GAAP Expense, EPS and Related Information The non-GAAP gross margin was 74.8 percent for the fourth quarter of 2016, the same as the fourth quarter of 2015. The non-GAAP gross margin was 75.7 percent for the full year of 2016 compared to 75.4 percent for the full year of 2015. The increase in GAAP gross margin for the full year of 2016 reflects lower inventory write-offs. Non-GAAP marketing and administrative expenses were $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016, comparable to the fourth quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP marketing and administrative expenses were $9.6 billion for the full year of 2016, a 2 percent decrease compared to the full year of 2015. The decline reflects the favorable impact of foreign exchange and lower direct selling costs. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016, a 3 percent decline compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. The decline reflects lower licensing costs. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $6.8 billion for the full year of 2016, a 3 percent increase compared to the full year of 2015 reflecting increased clinical development spending. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.89 for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with $0.93 for the fourth quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.78 for the full year of 2016 compared with $3.59 for the full year of 2015. Non-GAAP other (income) expense, net, was $32 million of expense in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $151 million of expense in the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily reflecting the receipt of a milestone payment. Non-GAAP other (income) expense, net, for the full year of 2016 was $115 million of expense compared to $348 million of expense for the full year of 2015, reflecting lower foreign exchange losses.

Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier on Thursday said he's encouraged by an initial meeting he and other pharmaceutical executives had Tuesday with Trump, who has said drugmakers have been "getting away with murder" on drug prices. The pharmaceutical industry has come under fire in recent months over soaring drug prices, which have been blasted by patients, doctors, politicians and others. Drug companies and investors have been alternatively worried that the Trump administration and Congress will move to reduce prices, and cheered by hopes that they will help them increase profits by reducing taxes and reducing regulations so they can bring new drugs to market faster. FILE - This Thursday, Dec. 18, 2014, file photo shows the Merck logo on a stained glass panel at a Merck company building in Kenilworth, N.J. Merck & Co. reports financial results Thursday, Feb. 2, 2017. (AP Photo/Mel Evans, File) On a conference call to discuss Merck's latest financial results, Frazier told analysts the meeting with Trump focused on possible changes to U.S. tax laws, removing "outdated" regulations and using market forces to make medicines more affordable. "What I heard from Mr. Trump was a concern less around the costs of drugs in the aggregate," and more about affordability for patients and finding a way for them to share in the sizeable discounts insurers and other payers negotiate with drugmakers, Frazier said. He said more meetings with Trump are expected, and that while he expects Congress to introduce bills calling for government price negotiations or controls, he doesn't think that's widely seen as a solution. Merck's fourth quarter profit surged 21 percent on the strength of aggressive cost-cutting and sales of two new drugs, the cancer medicine Keytruda and the hepatitis C treatment Zepatier. Keytruda is among the most successful of a new generation of cancer medicines that work by helping the immune system fight tumors. Launched in September 2014 for advanced skin cancer, Keytruda has since been approved for treating lung cancer — a much bigger market — plus head and neck cancer. Keytruda had sales of $483 million in the quarter and $1.4 billion over 2016, and could get U.S. approval in March for two other tumor types. Edward Jones analyst Ashtyn Evans wrote to investors that she expects annual Keytruda sales to reach $7 billion by 2020. Zepatier was launched early last year in the crowded field of new drugs that cure hepatitis C. It brought in $229 million in fourth-quarter sales, putting it on pace to possibly hit $1 billion in sales this year. Strong sales of those and other drugs, plus the cost cuts, helped Merck overcome the ongoing drag of lower revenues from older drugs, especially ones that are starting to face competition from generics, like the cholesterol pill Zetia and the allergy spray Nasonex. That will continue, as a big-selling cholesterol drug, Vytorin, will soon face cheaper copycats. Merck, the country's second-biggest drugmaker, reported fourth-quarter net income of $1.18 billion, or 42 cents per share. Excluding one-time costs, earnings were 89 cents per share, a penny better than industry analysts had projected. Sales dipped 1 percent to $10.12 billion, just shy of Wall Street forecasts for $10.2 billion. Merck shares jumped $1.75, or 3 percent, to $63.85 in midday trading. The Kenilworth, New Jersey, company expects full-year earnings in the range of $2.47 to $2.62 per share, with revenue of $38.6 billion to $40.1 billion — just a tad below what analysts were expecting. For all of 2016, Merck reported net income of $5.7 billion, or $2.04 per share, on revenue of $39.8 billion. BernsteinResearch analyst Tim Anderson called the 2017 forecasts "a relief," given Merck's prior cautionary language and what its rivals have been predicting for 2017. ___ Follow Linda A.

At one time, Senator Bernie Sanders agreed with Trump on some of his ideas to renegotiate pricing deals with pharmaceutical companies, according to a January 13 report from CNBC. Mainly, Sanders sided with Trump because Trump stated pharma companies were “getting away with murder” by overcharging the U.S. government for medications and other supplies, according to a January 11 report from Reuters. However, Bernie Sanders likely would not agree with Donald Trump’s new plans proposed on January 31, and Trump’s change of heart toward the pharma industry could be due to his conflicts of interest — more of which might be hidden in his still-unreleased tax returns. For now, what the public does know is that Trump met on January 31 with top pharma executives that own companies Trump has invested in the recent past. For example, in November of 2016, Forbes alleged Trump owns stock in pharma companies such as “Pfizer, Merck, Celgene and GlaxoSmithKline… Procter and Gamble, and Johnson and Johnson.” Business Insider gave a complete list of Trump’s investments as of July 2015, and there were other players in the pharmaceutical industry companies mentioned such as Gilead Sciences and McKesson (an information technology and pharmaceutical distribution services company). Adding to the idea that Trump may have conflicts of interest, among the pharma attendants at Trump’s meeting on January 31, according to Reuters, were top executives at Merck, Johnson and Johnson, Celgene, Eli Lilly, Amgen, and “Switzerland’s Novartis AG as well as the head of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America lobbying group (PhRMA).” Trump promised to be tough on big pharma and was not which might be an indication of a conflict of interest. [Image by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images] Business Insider gave a rundown of events, and also noted that after a hard month, pharma stocks were going up after the Trump PhRMA meeting on January 31. On December 7, 2016, Bloomberg quoted a representative of PhRMA claiming that she looks forward to a president that will give the pharmaceutical industry the power to “self-regulate on pricing” — and it appears she got her wish. Unlike some of the ideals that Bernie Sanders might agree with about the changes needed to the pharmaceutical industry, Donald Trump’s new plan is different than his old one, as told by VOX. For example, around March of 2016, Donald Trump adopted a “longstanding Democratic pledge to let Medicare negotiate bulk discounts in the price it pays for prescription drugs.” Despite this, Vox argues that on January 31, Trump reversed ideas about negotiating bulk discounts on drugs, and instead called his old ideas a version of “price fixing” that would inhibit small businesses in the pharmaceutical industry. In other words, instead of pressuring pharma to lower prices, Trump is going to give them more money by getting rid of regulations and lowering their taxes instead. A reason that there could be a “new plan” by Trump and pharma executives that favors PhRMA – and not the American people – is because Donald Trump has owned stocks in their companies in the recent past. Protesters could add Trump’s red flag of siding with Big Pharma as another excuse to denounce the president. [Image by Win McNamee/Getty Images] In fact, many of these companies are part of Trump’s stock investments, and Fortune listed pharmaceutical companies such as Celgene, Gilead Sciences, Johnson and Johnson, and McKesson in his top 14. Although Trump owned these stocks, he claims he has signed them over to his family in a “blind trust” that the Atlantic disputes is not truly “blind.” Instead, there are many opinions that Trump has and will continue to have issues with conflicts of interest regarding various industries despite denouncing that he will have conflicts of interest. Adding to the inability of the public to see through any lies that Donald Trump might put out that pertain to conflicts of interest he does not want the public to connect, Donald Trump has not officially turned in his tax returns from years past. Although it is required that a new president offers up their tax returns for scrutiny, and not doing it makes it difficult for the press to ascertain if there may be more conflicts of interest hidden behind his alleged “IRS audit” — the taxes are still not turned in even as President Trump makes executive orders. Furthermore, on January 22, Counselor Kellyanne Conway announced on behalf of President Trump that he “will not be releasing his tax returns,” according to CNN, and she also stated the following. “Our position from the campaign has not changed. [Trump] is under audit and has been advised by accountants and lawyers not to release [his tax returns].” In addition to conflicts of interest with Trump and Big Pharma, as previously reported by the Inquisitr, it is predicted that Trump’s poor bedside manner with other countries, such as Mexico or the seven countries involved in the Muslim ban, may start a trade war, according to former Mexican President Vincente Fox on January 30.

RedEye Your weekend plans. Delivered. Business Commentary: Trump had a good idea on drug costs. He ditched it after meeting with pharma execs. Trump, pharma leaders Ron Sachs / Getty Images President Donald Trump meets with representatives from PhRMA, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on January 31, 2017 President Donald Trump meets with representatives from PhRMA, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on January 31, 2017 (Ron Sachs / Getty Images) Joe NoceraBloomberg It wasn't all that long ago -- though it seems that way, admittedly, with the never-ending flood of Trumpian news -- that I was prepared to acknowledge that President Donald Trump actually has a few good ideas. Or at least one. It was Tuesday morning. The new president was about to go into a meeting with chief executives from Johnson & Johnson, Merck and a handful of other major pharma companies. During his campaign, he often said that if he were elected, the federal government would start negotiating with the drug companies over the prices Medicare and Medicaid had to pay for drugs -- something it's now prevented from doing by statute. This is an issue that resonated with most Americans, the majority of whom want the government to do something about high drug prices. Along with The Wall and the Return of Manufacturing, this appeared to be one of his core issues. And unlike some other campaign issues, it didn't fade away after the election. Pharma companies were "getting away with murder," he said on Jan. 10, because they "had a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power." A few weeks later, he claimed that the government would save $300 billion if it could negotiate prices. Majority in U.S. wants government to curb prescription costs, poll finds Chicago Tribune staff Regardless of political affiliation, Americans strongly support government action to control prescription drug costs, according to a poll released Thursday. While the 2016 presidential candidates continue to debate President Barack Obama's 5-year-old law expanding coverage for the uninsured, the... Regardless of political affiliation, Americans strongly support government action to control prescription drug costs, according to a poll released Thursday. While the 2016 presidential candidates continue to debate President Barack Obama's 5-year-old law expanding coverage for the uninsured, the... (Chicago Tribune staff) "We don't do it," he said. "Why? Because of the drug companies." Which is completely true. In 2003, when Congress passed the massive Part D Medicare prescription-drug benefit, Big Pharma was able to get a provision in the bill banning the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from negotiating directly with drug companies to set prices, as advanced countries tend to do. At the time, the drug-company strategy of drastically increasing drug prices was in its formative stage. For well over a decade, Big Pharma wallowed in the profits generated by multi-billion dollar blockbusters like Lipitor and Viagra. But as blockbusters grew scarce, companies needed to find new ways to make money and keep the stock price rising. Thus began the practice of bringing cancer drugs to market with annual price tags of $100,000 or more, buying up cheap generic drugs and turning them into expensive generic drugs, paying competitors to keep their drugs off the market to maintain monopoly prices, and so on.

(Andrew Lam) Inevitably, the cost of drugs started eating up an ever larger share of overall medical costs; it's now over $350 billion annually, which is about 10 percent of what the government calls the "national health expenditure." Indeed, drug sales are close to 2 percent of gross domestic product, according to a recent report by Ravi Mehrotra of MTS Health Partners. And all the while, the Medicare-Medicaid complex, the country's largest buyer of prescription drugs and therefore the entity with the most leverage to influence prices, has been forced to sit on the sidelines and let private insurance companies negotiate prices, which the government then has to accept. So yes, Trump's idea of allowing the government to negotiate on behalf of its beneficiaries is a good one. Although the president appears to have pulled the $300 billion in savings out of thin air, it would indeed save significant sums. Mehrotra suggests that the government could save $16 billion if Medicare Part D prices were negotiated. There would be three other benefits: insurance companies and consumers would save money because insurers would probably use the negotiated Medicare price as their baseline. Companies would have a harder time raising prices as much as they've done during the last decade because the government would push back harder than the insurance companies do. And there'd no longer be an absurd, opaque system of behind-the-scenes rebates and other deals that now make it impossible to know the real price of a drug.

(Tribune news services) "It wouldn't be simple," said Don Berwick, who was the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid administrator in 2010 and 2011. To cite one example, "CMS would have to have a formulary, like the insurance companies, so it could steer beneficiaries to a cheaper alternative if need be," Berwick said. Still, he added, it was something the government could accomplish if it wanted. Back to Tuesday's meeting: Trump goes into it as powerful as he'll ever be. The executives are scared of him (What if he tweets?!). The Republicans in Congress want to mollify him so they can get their tax cuts. Although executives and Republicans alike oppose empowering CMS to negotiate drug prices, it's possible -- it really is! -- that he could make it happen if he moves quickly. "We have to get prices down," he says at the beginning of the meeting with cameras rolling. "We have no choice." Then the doors were closed. When they opened again, Trump had not only abandoned his promise to use the government's bargaining power to bring down drug prices, he was now totally against it! "I'll oppose anything that makes it harder for smaller, younger companies to take the risk of bringing their product to a vibrantly competitive market," he said, according to the pool reporter. "That includes price-fixing by the biggest dog in the market, Medicare, which is what's happening." (Yes, he accused an agency that has no power to negotiate prices of "price-fixing.") And so it was that after one meeting with pharma CEOs, Trump was turned around on his one good idea and embraced instead yet another nonsensical one. Sigh.

REUTERS/Mike Blake/Illustration/File Photo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Merck & Co Inc , faced with patent expirations and increasing development costs for its high-profile Keytruda cancer immunotherapy, reassured investors on Thursday with a 2017 profit forecast roughly in line with Wall Street expectations. Shares of Merck were up nearly 3 percent at US$63.90 after the U.S. drugmaker also reported fourth-quarter earnings that matched analysts' expectations. Despite acknowledging a need to hold down costs, Merck said it was charging ahead with Keytruda development, with about 430 studies ongoing in a wide variety of cancers and combinations with other therapies. Merck forecast 2017 earnings of US$3.72 to US$3.87 per share, excluding special items. Analysts on average were expecting US$3.85 per share. The company gave a revenue outlook of US$38.6 billion to US$40.1 billion, compared with analysts' expectations of US$40.04 billion. "We are actually implying EPS growth despite the headwinds of loss of exclusivity and (foreign exchange) and the other challenges that we face," Chief Executive Officer Ken Frazier told analysts on a conference call. Merck expects unfavorable foreign exchange rates to sap 2 percent from 2017 global sales. Frazier said Merck was in the market for deals to augment its early to mid-stage drug development pipeline if the price is right. Such moves are not contingent on tax reform or changes to U.S. healthcare laws being discussed by President Trump and Congress, he added. In 2017, Merck will face generic competition for cholesterol drugs Zetia and Vytorin, antibiotic Cubicin and its Nasonex nasal spray in the United States and for Remicade, its big-selling arthritis drug, in Europe. But the U.S. drugmaker is confident it can solidify its leading position for Keytruda in lung cancer, by far the largest oncology market, and that it has the potential to become a foundational therapy in other cancers as well. Last summer Merck leapfrogged Bristol-Myers Squibb as the perceived leader in the market for potentially game-changing drugs that spur the immune system to fight cancer, when Keytruda extended survival among previously untreated lung cancer patients. Bristol's rival drug, Opdivo, failed to do so. Keytruda is now approved as a first-option treatment for non-small cell lung cancer patients whose tumor cells display a high level of the PD-L1 protein the drug targets, as well as for patients whose cancer has progressed after other treatments. Merck said there has been a significant acceleration of PD-L1 testing, a clear indication of heightened interest in use of Keytruda in first-line lung cancer. In May, Merck may also get U.S. approval for Keytruda with chemotherapy in first-line lung cancer, opening it up to many more potential patients. Edward Jones healthcare analyst Ashtyn Evans forecast annual Keytruda sales would reach US$7 billion by 2020. She said there was relief that Merck's 2017 forecast was not lower "because they really need to put a significant amount of investment behind Keytruda." Fourth-quarter Keytruda sales more than doubled from a year earlier to US$483 million, with 40 percent coming from melanoma, its initial approval, and 30 percent from lung cancer. Sales of diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet grew 4 percent to US$1.5 billion despite intensifying competition.

With sales surging for Keytruda and a second newcomer, Zepatier for hepatitis C, the country’s second-biggest drugmaker offset the impact of its latest round of generic competition for longtime big sellers, particularly cholesterol pill Zetia and allergy spray Nasonex. Keytruda is part of the new generation of immuno-oncology drugs, cancer medicines that work by stimulating the immune system to fight tumors. Launched in September 2014 for advanced melanoma, Keytruda has already surpassed annual sales of $1 billion and has since been approved as an initial treatment for lung cancer. Keytruda, which currently has the lead in the increasingly competitive immuno-oncology field, could get U.S. approval in March for two other tumor types. Zepatier, launched early last year in the crowded field of new drugs that cure hepatitis C in just a couple of months, hit $229 million in fourth-quarter sales, putting it on pace to possibly hit $1 billion in sales this year. Generics and newer, branded drugs continue to press Merck, however, and quarterly sales dipped 1 percent to $10.12 billion, just shy of Wall Street forecasts for $10.2 billion. In the quarter, sales hit $483 million for Keytruda, while top sellers Januvia and Janumet for Type 2 diabetes had combined sales of $1.5 billion. Merck’s veterinary medicines brought in $884 million, up 6 percent, mainly on rising sales of pet medicines such as Bravecto flea-and-tick killer. Fourth-quarter net income was $1.18 billion, or 42 cents per share. Adjusted for costs related to mergers, acquisitions and other non-recurring costs, per-share earnings were 89 cents per share, a penny better than industry analysts had projected. The Kenilworth, New Jersey, company expects full-year earnings in the range of $3.72 to $3.87 per share, with revenue in the range of $38.6 billion to $40.1 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting $3.83 per share and sales of $40.13 billion, on average. For all of 2016, Merck reported net income of $5.7 billion, or $2.04 per share, on revenue of $39.8 billion. BernsteinResearch analyst Dr. Tim Anderson wrote to investors that Merck’s 2017 revenue and earnings-per-share forecasts were “decent,” calling that “a relief,” given Merck’s prior cautionary language and what its rivals have been predicting for 2017. Anderson noted that Merck remains one of his top three picks in the industry. Merck shares have climbed 22 percent in the last 12 months. In trading early Thursday afternoon, Merck shares were up $1.90, or 3.1 percent, to $64.

(NYSE: MRK) reported its fourth-quarter financial results before the markets opened on Thursday. The company posted $0.89 in earnings per share (EPS) and $10.12 billion in revenue, versus consensus estimates of $0.89 in EPS and revenue of $10.22 billion. In the same period of last year, the pharma giant posted EPS of $0.93 and $10.22 billion in revenue. Fourth-quarter pharmaceutical sales decreased 1% to $8.9 billion, primarily due to the loss of U.S. market exclusivity in 2016 for Cubicin, Nasonex and Zetia. However, these declines were largely offset by growth in oncology, hepatitis C, diabetes and vaccines, which include the ongoing launches of Keytruda and Zepatier. Animal Health sales totaled $884 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 6% when compared year over year. In terms of the guidance for the 2017 full year, the company expects EPS to be in the range of $3.72 to $3.87 and revenues to be between $38.6 billion and $40.1 billion. The consensus estimates call for $3.83 in EPS and $40.13 billion in revenue. During this quarter, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a supplemental Biologics License Application for Keytruda for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression. Kenneth C. Frazier, board chair and chief executive of Merck, commented: The performance of Merck’s broad and balanced portfolio allows us to remain committed to biomedical innovation that saves and improves lives and delivers long-term value to shareholders. The momentum behind our pipeline and key product launches, including the continued growth and expansion of KEYTRUDA into new indications and markets around the world, further reinforces our company’s strategic direction. Shares of Merck closed Wednesday at $62.10, in a 52-week trading range of $47.97 to $65.46. Following the release of the earnings report, the stock was relatively flat in early trading indications Thursday.

Jason Chaffetz Pulls Bill Aiming to Sell Off Public Lands HEALTH Should the Leader of the Free World Be Taking Propecia? Credit: Getty Images In an interview with the New York Times today, President Donald Trump’s long-time physician, Dr. Harold N. Bornstein, noted that the leader’s PSA levels are low because he takes finasteride (also known as Propecia) to keep his locks long. The leader of the free world might want to think twice about continuing with this prescription. MORE: Are Hair-Loss Drugs Safe? The Truth About Propecia As we reported last year, the FDA-approved pill has been called into question, with emerging research and a slew of lawsuits suggesting that finasteride may be more dangerous than previously believed. Users report that its side effects — inability to orgasm, painful erections, chronic depression, insomnia, brain fog, and suicidal thoughts — can last long after patients stop taking the pill. That’s not to say it doesn’t do its primary job. Finasteride, which first came out in 1997, has been shown to thicken hair in 65 percent of those who take it. And more than 26 new generic versions, priced at less than a dollar a pill (versus $3 for Propecia), have made the drug even more attractive. While the packaging warns of a 1 to 2 percent chance of temporary sexual side effects, millions of men consider that a risk worth taking. ALSO: Hair Loss Drugs and Erectile Dysfunction: What You Need to Know However, since 2011, approximately 1,245 lawsuits have been filed against Propecia's manufacturer, Merck, alleging that the company failed to warn users of a constellation of sexual and cognitive side effects — which patients and physicians now dub "post-finasteride syndrome" (PFS) because, they say, symptoms often persist after discontinuing the drug. Now the National Institutes of Health has added PFS to its rare-diseases database. Two years ago, a California woman filed the first wrongful death suit against Merck. Her husband, a 40-year-old IT executive and father of two with no history of mental illness, killed himself in March 2013. His family blames finasteride. Knowing the drug's origins might prompt some to shy away from it. Finasteride has its roots in the 1970s, when scientists discovered a rare group of men in the Dominican Republic who were born with ambiguous genitalia and often mistakenly raised as girls. These men possessed other unique traits: They never lost their hair or had prostate problems. This was because they failed to produce an enzyme that converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, or DHT. DHT is critical for fetal development of male genitals, but in adults it impairs hair growth. Enter Merck, which unveiled a compound — finasteride — that slashes DHT levels 70 percent. As experts describe it, the drug works by mimicking the sex-steroid profile of pseudohermaphrodites. Some former male users equate this to "chemical castration." To this day, health officials warn women not to even touch finasteride pills, because doing so could cause genital malformations in an unborn boy. Put party politics aside, and there’s obvious reason why a president taking a prescription that some experts believe may bring on permanent mental illness (not to mention sexual dysfunction) is worrisome. As many PFS patients have claimed, the side effects of taking finasteride can come on suddenly, and years after beginning to take the drug. President Trump should count himself lucky if he hasn’t experienced any of these potentially dangerous effects. But unfortunately, that doesn’t mean he won’t in the future.

While other rival treatments have faltered, Keytruda has been approved in the US and elsewhere for new lung cancer patients in addition to its original indication for melanoma. Lung cancer in the US is a market worth at least US$12bn a year. Keytruda’s revenues more than doubled in the fourth quarter to US$483mln (US$214mln), easily outstripping growth in Merck's other products where with the exception of Pneumovax23 the revenue improvements were either modest or in decline. That meant revenues overall in the last three months were little changed at US$10.1bn, while net earnings rose to US$1.18bn (US$978mln). For 2017, further developments with Keytruda dominate Merck’s agenda. Four additional applications for non small cell lung cancer are ongoing, while a breakthrough treatment designation was awarded the drug for patients previously treated for urothelial carcinoma and B-cell lymphoma. Full year revenues in 2016 were US$39.8bn (US$39.5bn), with earnings of US$2.04. This year Merck is forecasting revenues to come in between US$38.6bn and $40.1bn after a 2% foreign exchange hit, while earnings will be between US$2.47 to US$2.62. Kenneth Frazier, chief executive, said: “The momentum behind our pipeline and key product launches, including the continued growth and expansion of KEYTRUDA into new indications and markets around the world, further reinforces our company’s strategic direction.” Shares rose 3% to US$63.83.

REUTERS/Mike Blake/Illustration/File Photo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Merck & Co Inc , faced with patent expirations and increasing development costs for its high-profile Keytruda cancer immunotherapy, reassured investors on Thursday with a 2017 profit forecast roughly in line with Wall Street expectations. Shares of Merck were up nearly 3 percent at US$63.90 after the U.S. drugmaker also reported fourth-quarter earnings that matched analysts' expectations. Despite acknowledging a need to hold down costs, Merck said it was charging ahead with Keytruda development, with about 430 studies ongoing in a wide variety of cancers and combinations with other therapies. Merck forecast 2017 earnings of US$3.72 to US$3.87 per share, excluding special items. Analysts on average were expecting US$3.85 per share. The company gave a revenue outlook of US$38.6 billion to US$40.1 billion, compared with analysts' expectations of US$40.04 billion. "We are actually implying EPS growth despite the headwinds of loss of exclusivity and (foreign exchange) and the other challenges that we face," Chief Executive Officer Ken Frazier told analysts on a conference call. Merck expects unfavorable foreign exchange rates to sap 2 percent from 2017 global sales. Frazier said Merck was in the market for deals to augment its early to mid-stage drug development pipeline if the price is right. Such moves are not contingent on tax reform or changes to U.S. healthcare laws being discussed by President Trump and Congress, he added. In 2017, Merck will face generic competition for cholesterol drugs Zetia and Vytorin, antibiotic Cubicin and its Nasonex nasal spray in the United States and for Remicade, its big-selling arthritis drug, in Europe. But the U.S. drugmaker is confident it can solidify its leading position for Keytruda in lung cancer, by far the largest oncology market, and that it has the potential to become a foundational therapy in other cancers as well. Last summer Merck leapfrogged Bristol-Myers Squibb as the perceived leader in the market for potentially game-changing drugs that spur the immune system to fight cancer, when Keytruda extended survival among previously untreated lung cancer patients. Bristol's rival drug, Opdivo, failed to do so. Keytruda is now approved as a first-option treatment for non-small cell lung cancer patients whose tumor cells display a high level of the PD-L1 protein the drug targets, as well as for patients whose cancer has progressed after other treatments. Merck said there has been a significant acceleration of PD-L1 testing, a clear indication of heightened interest in use of Keytruda in first-line lung cancer. In May, Merck may also get U.S. approval for Keytruda with chemotherapy in first-line lung cancer, opening it up to many more potential patients. Edward Jones healthcare analyst Ashtyn Evans forecast annual Keytruda sales would reach US$7 billion by 2020. She said there was relief that Merck's 2017 forecast was not lower "because they really need to put a significant amount of investment behind Keytruda." Fourth-quarter Keytruda sales more than doubled from a year earlier to US$483 million, with 40 percent coming from melanoma, its initial approval, and 30 percent from lung cancer. Sales of diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet grew 4 percent to US$1.5 billion despite intensifying competition.

Hors éléments exceptionnels, le BPA est ressorti à 89 cents, soit un cent au-dessus du consensus. Le chiffre d'affaires a reculé de 1% à 10,12 milliards. Les analystes tablaient sur 10,2 milliards. Les ventes de son traitement phare contre le cancer, le Keytruda, ont bondi de 125% à 443 millions de dollars mais Wall Street tablait sur 470 millions. AOF - EN SAVOIR PLUS Pharmacie - Santé Les fusions-acquisitions ralentissent dans l'industrie mondiale. Selon une étude menée par PwC, la valeur des deals entre entreprises du médicament a atteint 173,2 milliards de dollars sur les trois premiers trimestres de l'année, malgré une acquisition de poids (Medivation racheté par Pfizer pour 14 milliards de dollars). Sur la même période, le montant a atteint 261,6 milliards de dollars en 2015 (pour un total de plus de 300 milliards de dollars sur l'ensemble de l'année). Le cabinet de conseil explique ce phénomène par le fait que les acquéreurs préfèrent désormais des cibles de plus petites tailles, dans une logique de diversification, pour se recentrer sur quelques domaines thérapeutiques. De plus les attaques sur le prix des médicaments ont rendu les acteurs méfiants pour l'avenir. Mots clés Merck L'actualité en vidéo Réagissez !

 Merck's quarter was plagued by disappointing sales of a key drug Natalie Grover, Reuters Feb. 2, 2017, 8:11 AM 1,259 facebook linkedin twitter email print Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier, speaking in 2015. AP (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc's quarterly revenue narrowly missed Wall Street expectations, hurt by lower-than-expected sales of its key immuno-oncology drug, Keytruda, and its diabetes medicines. The company also forecast 2017 adjusted earnings in the range of $3.72 to $3.87 per share on revenue of $38.6 billion-$40.1 billion. Analysts on average were expecting an adjusted profit of $3.85 per share and revenue of $40.04 billion. Sales of Keytruda, which works by taking the brakes off the immune system, more than doubled to $483 million in the fourth-quarter, but missed the consensus estimate of $508.8 million, according to Evercore ISI. The company's diabetes drugs, Januvia and Janumet, generated sales of $1.51 billion, also coming below expectations of $1.58 billion. Quarterly sales fell 1 percent to $10.12 billion, which the company blamed on a strong dollar and loss of market exclusivity on certain drugs. Analysts on average had expected sales of $10.22 billion. Excluding items, Merck earned 89 cents per share, in line with Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimates. Net income attributable to shareholders rose to $1.17 billion, or 42 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 from $976 million, or 35 cents per share, a year earlier.

Inc. MRK, +3.35% shares surged as much as 1.4% in pre-market trade after company earnings numbers appeared to show its blockbuster Keytruda cancer drug beat expectations. But on the company's earnings call, management said fourth-quarter sales for the drug included a one-time adjustment of $40 million in revenue "that had previously been deferred," according to the FactSet transcript. As such, Keytruda fourth-quarter revenue was $443 million, compared with the FactSet consensus of $470 million. The Keytruda revenue number -- at $483, a 125% increase from the year-earlier period -- had previously appeared to be "the most important positive," said Evercore ISI's Mark Schoenebaum.

Das Krebsmittel verkaufte sich besser als erwartet und half Umsatzverluste auszugleichen bei anderen Medikamenten, die ihren Patentschutz verloren haben. Für die letzten drei Monate des Geschäftsjahres 2016 wies der Konzern insgesamt 10,1 Milliarden US-Dollar Umsatz aus. Der Rückgang von einem Prozent im Vergleich zum Vorjahr ging auf das Konto von Währungseffekten, wie Merck am Donnerstag mitteilte. 02.02.2017 15:08 Unter dem Strich stieg der Gewinn dank Kosteneinsparungen um 21 Prozent auf 1,18 Milliarden Dollar. Je Aktie und um Sondereffekte bereinigt wies Merck für das vierte Quartal 0,89 Dollar Gewinn aus, was auch den Analystenschätzungen entsprach. Den Keytruda-Umsatz konnte Merck im vierten Quartal auf 483 Millionen Dollar mehr als verdoppeln. Das war um einiges mehr als Analysten im Schnitt erwartet hatten. Keytruda gehört zu einer neuen Art von Krebsmedikamenten, welche das Immunsystem stimulieren, damit dieses die Krebszellen bekämpft. Da Merck für das Mittel stetig neue Zulassungsanträge stellt und auch erhält, trauen Experten dem Medikament bis zum Jahr 2019 einen Umsatz von mehr als 6 Milliarden Dollar zu. 2016 waren es 1,4 Milliarden Dollar. Merck-Pharmachef Adam Schechter sagte jüngst in einem Interview, ein einziges Produkt in über 400 Testverfahren zu haben, sei beispiellos. Die neuartigen Krebsmittel sind allerdings auch sehr teuer. Merck-Konzernchef Ken Frazier war einer aus einer Reihe wichtiger Pharma-Bosse, die sich kürzlich mit US-Präsident Donald Trump getroffen hatten. Trump war die Branche im Wahlkampf wegen ihrer Medikamentenpreise hart angegangen. Merck braucht allerdings auch dringend neue Umsatztreiber, denn Patente für andere Medikamente laufen aus und billigere Konkurrenzprodukte von Generikaherstellern kommen auf den Markt. Neben Krebsmedikamenten ist Merck auch bei Arzneien gegen Diabetes und Hepatitis C sowie Impfstoffen stark. Im laufenden Jahr will Merck einen bereinigten Gewinn je Aktie von 3,72 bis 3,87 Dollar (2016: 3,78) ausweisen. Der Umsatz soll zwischen 38,6 und 40,1 Milliarden Dollar (2016: 39,8) liegen.

JOHNSON AP Medical Writer Feb 2, 2017 Updated 13 hrs ago 0 Mel Evans FILE - This Thursday, Dec. 18, 2014, file photo shows the Merck logo on a stained glass panel at a Merck company building in Kenilworth, N.J. Merck & Co. reports financial results Thursday, Feb. 2, 2017. (AP Photo/Mel Evans, File) Profits at the drugmaker Merck surged in the fourth quarter, and the company CEO told investors that a "constructive" meeting with President Donald Trump focused on reducing taxes and relaxing regulations. Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier on Thursday said he's encouraged by an initial meeting he and other pharmaceutical executives had Tuesday with Trump, who has said drugmakers have been "getting away with murder" on drug prices. The pharmaceutical industry has come under fire in recent months over soaring drug prices, which have been blasted by patients, doctors, politicians and others. Drug companies and investors have been alternatively worried that the Trump administration and Congress will move to reduce prices, and cheered by hopes that they will help them increase profits by reducing taxes and reducing regulations so they can bring new drugs to market faster. On a conference call to discuss Merck's latest financial results, Frazier told analysts the meeting with Trump focused on possible changes to U.S. tax laws, removing "outdated" regulations and using market forces to make medicines more affordable. "What I heard from Mr. Trump was a concern less around the costs of drugs in the aggregate," and more about affordability for patients and finding a way for them to share in the sizeable discounts insurers and other payers negotiate with drugmakers, Frazier said. He said more meetings with Trump are expected, and that while he expects Congress to introduce bills calling for government price negotiations or controls, he doesn't think that's widely seen as a solution. Merck's fourth quarter profit surged 21 percent on the strength of aggressive cost-cutting and sales of two new drugs, the cancer medicine Keytruda and the hepatitis C treatment Zepatier. Keytruda is among the most successful of a new generation of cancer medicines that work by helping the immune system fight tumors. Launched in September 2014 for advanced skin cancer, Keytruda has since been approved for treating lung cancer — a much bigger market — plus head and neck cancer. Keytruda had sales of $483 million in the quarter and $1.4 billion over 2016, and could get U.S. approval in March for two other tumor types. Edward Jones analyst Ashtyn Evans wrote to investors that she expects annual Keytruda sales to reach $7 billion by 2020. Zepatier was launched early last year in the crowded field of new drugs that cure hepatitis C. It brought in $229 million in fourth-quarter sales, putting it on pace to possibly hit $1 billion in sales this year. Strong sales of those and other drugs, plus the cost cuts, helped Merck overcome the ongoing drag of lower revenues from older drugs, especially ones that are starting to face competition from generics, like the cholesterol pill Zetia and the allergy spray Nasonex. That will continue, as a big-selling cholesterol drug, Vytorin, will soon face cheaper copycats. Merck, the country's second-biggest drugmaker, reported fourth-quarter net income of $1.18 billion, or 42 cents per share. Excluding one-time costs, earnings were 89 cents per share, a penny better than industry analysts had projected. Sales dipped 1 percent to $10.12 billion, just shy of Wall Street forecasts for $10.2 billion. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

JOHNSON Associated PressFebruary 2, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share FILE - This Thursday, Dec. 18, 2014, file photo shows the Merck logo on a stained glass panel at a Merck company building in Kenilworth, N.J. Merck & Co. reports financial results Thursday, Feb. 2, 2017. (AP Photo/Mel Evans, File)More Profits at the drugmaker Merck surged in the fourth quarter, and the company CEO told investors that a "constructive" meeting with President Donald Trump focused on reducing taxes and relaxing regulations. Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier on Thursday said he's encouraged by an initial meeting he and other pharmaceutical executives had Tuesday with Trump, who has said drugmakers have been "getting away with murder" on drug prices. The pharmaceutical industry has come under fire in recent months over soaring drug prices, which have been blasted by patients, doctors, politicians and others. Drug companies and investors have been alternatively worried that the Trump administration and Congress will move to reduce prices, and cheered by hopes that they will help them increase profits by reducing taxes and reducing regulations so they can bring new drugs to market faster. On a conference call to discuss Merck's latest financial results, Frazier told analysts the meeting with Trump focused on possible changes to U.S. tax laws, removing "outdated" regulations and using market forces to make medicines more affordable. "What I heard from Mr. Trump was a concern less around the costs of drugs in the aggregate," and more about affordability for patients and finding a way for them to share in the sizeable discounts insurers and other payers negotiate with drugmakers, Frazier said. He said more meetings with Trump are expected, and that while he expects Congress to introduce bills calling for government price negotiations or controls, he doesn't think that's widely seen as a solution. Merck's fourth quarter profit surged 21 percent on the strength of aggressive cost-cutting and sales of two new drugs, the cancer medicine Keytruda and the hepatitis C treatment Zepatier. Keytruda is among the most successful of a new generation of cancer medicines that work by helping the immune system fight tumors. Launched in September 2014 for advanced skin cancer, Keytruda has since been approved for treating lung cancer — a much bigger market — plus head and neck cancer. Keytruda had sales of $483 million in the quarter and $1.4 billion over 2016, and could get U.S. approval in March for two other tumor types. Edward Jones analyst Ashtyn Evans wrote to investors that she expects annual Keytruda sales to reach $7 billion by 2020. Zepatier was launched early last year in the crowded field of new drugs that cure hepatitis C. It brought in $229 million in fourth-quarter sales, putting it on pace to possibly hit $1 billion in sales this year. Strong sales of those and other drugs, plus the cost cuts, helped Merck overcome the ongoing drag of lower revenues from older drugs, especially ones that are starting to face competition from generics, like the cholesterol pill Zetia and the allergy spray Nasonex. That will continue, as a big-selling cholesterol drug, Vytorin, will soon face cheaper copycats. Merck, the country's second-biggest drugmaker, reported fourth-quarter net income of $1.18 billion, or 42 cents per share. Excluding one-time costs, earnings were 89 cents per share, a penny better than industry analysts had projected. Sales dipped 1 percent to $10.12 billion, just shy of Wall Street forecasts for $10.2 billion. Merck shares jumped $1.75, or 3 percent, to $63.85 in midday trading. The Kenilworth, New Jersey, company expects full-year earnings in the range of $2.47 to $2.62 per share, with revenue of $38.6 billion to $40.1 billion — just a tad below what analysts were expecting. For all of 2016, Merck reported net income of $5.7 billion, or $2.04 per share, on revenue of $39.8 billion. BernsteinResearch analyst Tim Anderson called the 2017 forecasts "a relief," given Merck's prior cautionary language and what its rivals have been predicting for 2017. ___ Follow Linda A.

Shares of Merck were up nearly 3 percent at $63.90 after the U.S. drugmaker also reported fourth-quarter earnings that matched analysts' expectations. Despite acknowledging a need to hold down costs, Merck said it was charging ahead with Keytruda development, with about 430 studies ongoing in a wide variety of cancers and combinations with other therapies. Merck forecast 2017 earnings of $3.72 to $3.87 per share, excluding special items. Analysts on average were expecting $3.85 per share. The company gave a revenue outlook of $38.6 billion to $40.1 billion, compared with analysts' expectations of $40.04 billion. "We are actually implying EPS growth despite the headwinds of loss of exclusivity and (foreign exchange) and the other challenges that we face," Chief Executive Officer Ken Frazier told analysts on a conference call. Merck expects unfavorable foreign exchange rates to sap 2 percent from 2017 global sales. Frazier said Merck was in the market for deals to augment its early to mid-stage drug development pipeline if the price is right. Such moves are not contingent on tax reform or changes to U.S. healthcare laws being discussed by President Trump and Congress, he added. In 2017, Merck will face generic competition for cholesterol drugs Zetia and Vytorin, antibiotic Cubicin and its Nasonex nasal spray in the United States and for Remicade, its big-selling arthritis drug, in Europe. But the U.S. drugmaker is confident it can solidify its leading position for Keytruda in lung cancer, by far the largest oncology market, and that it has the potential to become a foundational therapy in other cancers as well. Last summer Merck leapfrogged Bristol-Myers Squibb as the perceived leader in the market for potentially game-changing drugs that spur the immune system to fight cancer, when Keytruda extended survival among previously untreated lung cancer patients. Bristol's rival drug, Opdivo, failed to do so. Keytruda is now approved as a first-option treatment for non-small cell lung cancer patients whose tumor cells display a high level of the PD-L1 protein the drug targets, as well as for patients whose cancer has progressed after other treatments. Merck said there has been a significant acceleration of PD-L1 testing, a clear indication of heightened interest in use of Keytruda in first-line lung cancer. In May, Merck may also get U.S. approval for Keytruda with chemotherapy in first-line lung cancer, opening it up to many more potential patients. Edward Jones healthcare analyst Ashtyn Evans forecast annual Keytruda sales would reach $7 billion by 2020. She said there was relief that Merck's 2017 forecast was not lower "because they really need to put a significant amount of investment behind Keytruda." Fourth-quarter Keytruda sales more than doubled from a year earlier to $483 million, with 40 percent coming from melanoma, its initial approval, and 30 percent from lung cancer. Sales of diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet grew 4 percent to $1.5 billion despite intensifying competition.

Profit Meets View, But Revenues Miss 2/2/2017 7:15 AM ET Merck & Co. Inc. (MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, on Thursday reported a 21 percent increase in profit for the fourth quarter from last year, as a slight decline in sales was more than offset by lower expenses. Adjusted earnings per share matched analysts' expectations, while revenues missed their estimates. Looking ahead, the company forecast financial results for fiscal 2017 in line with analysts' estimates. For the fourth quarter, net income rose to $1.18 billion or $0.42 per share from $976 million or $0.35 per share last year. On an adjusted basis, earnings for the quarter were $0.89 per share, compared to $0.93 per share last year. On average, 18 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected the company to earn $0.89 per share. Analysts' estimates usually exclude special items. Total sales for the quarter declined 1 percent to $10.12 billion from $10.22 billion a year ago. Wall Street expected revenues of $10.22 billion. The quarter's sales results include a 1 percent negative impact from foreign exchange. It also includes the unfavorable impact of about $150 million of sales in Japan, which occurred in the third quarter of 2016 rather than in the fourth quarter due to the implementation of a resource planning system. Pharmaceutical products recorded a 1 percent decline in sales for the quarter to $8.90 billion, driven primarily by the loss of U.S. market exclusivity in 2016 for Cubicin, Nasonex and Zetia as well as as well as by the ongoing impact of biosimilar competition in the company's marketing territories in Europe for Remicade. These declines were largely offset by growth in oncology, hepatitis C, diabetes and vaccines, which include the ongoing launches of Keytruda and Zepatier. However, Januvia/Janumet sales increased 4 percent to $1.51 billion. Animal Health sales rose 6 percent to $884 million. Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, Merck forecast earnings per share in a range of $2.47 to $2.62, adjusted earnings of $3.72 to $3.87 per share and sales in a range of $38.6 billion and $40.1 billion. The Street expects earnings of $3.85 per share for the year on revenue of $40.04 billion. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Main Economic Events In Europe In February -- A Preview Fed Meets First Time Under New Regime – Economic Preview for Week of Jan. 30 The World's 10 Most Productive Nations, Ranked Previous Story Next Story More Top Stories Company Spotlight: Pulmatrix Asian Shares Mixed As China Raises Interest Rates Metro AG Stock Down On Weak Q1 Profit; Backs FY17 Sales Growth View Scotiabank Spending $1 Bln On Digital Tech European Shares Seen Opening On Subdued Note PBoC Lifts Short-Term Interest Rates Signaling Tightening Longtime Micron Tech CEO Mark Durcan To Retire Asian Markets Mostly Lower Amid Cautious Trades Gainers & Losers Of The Day: BNTC, PULM, CALA, STML, CORI...

(NYSE:MRK) early Thursday posted mixed fourth quarter earnings and provided a tepid outlook, as it suffers through multiple patent expirations of key medications. The Kenilworth, NJ-based pharmaceutical giant reported adjusted Q4 EPS of $0.89, which was in-line with the Wall Street consensus estimate of $0.89. Revenues fell 1% from last year to $10.12 billion, falling short of analysts’ $10.23 billion view. Merck noted that fourth quarter pharmaceutical sales, which represent the bulk of its business, declined 1% to $8.9 billion. The downturn was driven by the loss of U.S. market exclusivity in 2016 for a handful of key drugs, along with greater competition in Europe for certain treatments. Looking ahead, MRK forecast adjusted full-year 2017 EPS of $3.72 to $3.87, which could miss Wall Street’s current estimate of $3.87. 2017 revenues were forecast ranging from $38.6 to $40.1 billion, also below analysts’ $40.19 view. The company commented via press release: “The performance of Merck’s broad and balanced portfolio allows us to remain committed to biomedical innovation that saves and improves lives and delivers long-term value to shareholders,” said Kenneth C. Frazier, chairman and chief executive officer, Merck. “The momentum behind our pipeline and key product launches, including the continued growth and expansion of KEYTRUDA into new indications and markets around the world, further reinforces our company’s strategic direction.” Despite the seemingly lackluster outlook, Merck & Co., Inc. shares were unchanged in premarket trading Thursday. Year-to-date, MRK has gained 5.49%, versus a 1.83% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. MRK currently has a StockNews.com POWR Rating of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #1 of 134 stocks in the Medical – Pharmaceuticals category. This article is brought to you courtesy of StockNews.com.

Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier on Thursday said he’s encouraged by an initial meeting he and other pharmaceutical executives had Tuesday with Trump, who has said drugmakers have been “getting away with murder” on drug prices. The pharmaceutical industry has come under fire in recent months over soaring drug prices, which have been blasted by patients, doctors, politicians and others. Drug companies and investors have been alternatively worried that the Trump administration and Congress will move to reduce prices, and cheered by hopes that they will help them increase profits by reducing taxes and reducing regulations so they can bring new drugs to market faster. Hiring freeze: Some answers, some questions On a conference call to discuss Merck’s latest financial results, Frazier told analysts the meeting with Trump focused on possible changes to U.S. tax laws, removing “outdated” regulations and using market forces to make medicines more affordable. Advertisement “What I heard from Mr. Trump was a concern less around the costs of drugs in the aggregate,” and more about affordability for patients and finding a way for them to share in the sizeable discounts insurers and other payers negotiate with drugmakers, Frazier said. He said more meetings with Trump are expected, and that while he expects Congress to introduce bills calling for government price negotiations or controls, he doesn’t think that’s widely seen as a solution. Merck’s fourth quarter profit surged 21 percent on the strength of aggressive cost-cutting and sales of two new drugs, the cancer medicine Keytruda and the hepatitis C treatment Zepatier. Keytruda is among the most successful of a new generation of cancer medicines that work by helping the immune system fight tumors. Launched in September 2014 for advanced skin cancer, Keytruda has since been approved for treating lung cancer — a much bigger market — plus head and neck cancer. Keytruda had sales of $483 million in the quarter and $1.4 billion over 2016, and could get U.S. approval in March for two other tumor types. Edward Jones analyst Ashtyn Evans wrote to investors that she expects annual Keytruda sales to reach $7 billion by 2020. Zepatier was launched early last year in the crowded field of new drugs that cure hepatitis C. It brought in $229 million in fourth-quarter sales, putting it on pace to possibly hit $1 billion in sales this year. Strong sales of those and other drugs, plus the cost cuts, helped Merck overcome the ongoing drag of lower revenues from older drugs, especially ones that are starting to face competition from generics, like the cholesterol pill Zetia and the allergy spray Nasonex. That will continue, as a big-selling cholesterol drug, Vytorin, will soon face cheaper copycats. Merck, the country’s second-biggest drugmaker, reported fourth-quarter net income of $1.18 billion, or 42 cents per share. Excluding one-time costs, earnings were 89 cents per share, a penny better than industry analysts had projected. Sales dipped 1 percent to $10.12 billion, just shy of Wall Street forecasts for $10.2 billion. Merck shares jumped $1.75, or 3 percent, to $63.85 in midday trading. The Kenilworth, New Jersey, company expects full-year earnings in the range of $2.47 to $2.62 per share, with revenue of $38.6 billion to $40.1 billion — just a tad below what analysts were expecting. For all of 2016, Merck reported net income of $5.7 billion, or $2.04 per share, on revenue of $39.8 billion. BernsteinResearch analyst Tim Anderson called the 2017 forecasts “a relief,” given Merck’s prior cautionary language and what its rivals have been predicting for 2017. ___ Follow Linda A.

Inc. (NYSE: MRK) and Visa Inc. (NYSE: V). We have seen the markets hit new highs so far in 2017, but they seem to be in the midst of a pullback at the moment as the Trump administration is kicking into gear. We included the consensus earnings estimates from Thomson Reuters and the stock price and trading history, as well as added some additional color on each. Merck is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter earnings report before the markets open on Thursday. The consensus estimates from Thomson Reuters call for $0.89 in earnings per share (EPS) and $10.22 billion in revenue. The same period of last year reportedly had EPS of $0.93 and $10.21 billion in revenue. Comments from President Donald Trump regarding high U.S. drug prices were initially considered to be a headwind for Merck and other pharmaceutical houses at the beginning of the year. But after comments this week regarding speeding up the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process, the health care sector saw a nice gain. At the beginning of January, the U.S. Senate also defeated an amendment to the budget bill that would have allowed a review federal policy preventing re-importation of prescription drugs into the United States. Shares of Merck were last seen at $61.80, with a consensus analyst price target of $68.21 and a 52-week trading range of $47.97 to $65.46. Visa is set to report its fiscal first-quarter financial results after the markets close on Thursday. Analysts are looking for $0.78 in EPS and revenue of $4.29 billion. In the same period of last year, Visa posted EPS of $0.69 and $3.56 billion in revenue. This company has a few new avenues open for it this year. Just this past summer, Visa initiated a deal with famed online payment provider PayPal. Together the companies will partner up, giving Visa customers a network online network for digital payments while also bringing more business to PayPal. But keep in mind they will face some stiff competition breaking into this market; Visa and PayPal are up against the likes of Google Wallet and Apple Pay. PayPal had a similar deal with Mastercard, which reported its results earlier this week. Unfortunately Mastercard earnings did not live up to the hype. Visa shares were trading at $82.31 on Wednesday. The 52-week range is $66.12 to $84.27, and the consensus price target is $95.45.

It wasn’t all that long ago — though it seems that way, admittedly, with the never-ending flood of Trumpian news — that I was prepared to acknowledge that President Donald Trump actually has a few good ideas. Or at least one. It was Tuesday morning. The new president was about to go into a meeting with chief executives from Johnson & Johnson, Merck and a handful of other major pharma companies. During his campaign, he often said that if he were elected, the federal government would start negotiating with the drug companies over the prices Medicare and Medicaid had to pay for drugs — something it’s now prevented from doing by statute. This is an issue that resonated with most Americans, the majority of whom want the government to do something about high drug prices. Along with The Wall and the Return of Manufacturing, this appeared to be one of his core issues. And unlike some other campaign issues, it didn’t fade away after the election. Pharma companies were “getting away with murder,” he said on Jan. 10, because they “had a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power.” A few weeks later, he claimed that the government would save $300 billion if it could negotiate prices. “We don’t do it,” he said. “Why? Because of the drug companies.” Which is completely true. In 2003, when Congress passed the massive Part D Medicare prescription-drug benefit, Big Pharma was able to get a provision in the bill banning the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from negotiating directly with drug companies to set prices, as advanced countries tend to do. At the time, the drug-company strategy of drastically increasing drug prices was in its formative stage. For well over a decade, Big Pharma wallowed in the profits generated by multibillion-dollar blockbusters like Lipitor and Viagra. But as blockbusters grew scarce, companies needed to find new ways to make money and keep the stock price rising. Thus began the practice of bringing cancer drugs to market with annual price tags of $100,000 or more, buying up cheap generic drugs and turning them into expensive generic drugs, paying competitors to keep their drugs off the market to maintain monopoly prices, and so on. Inevitably, the cost of drugs started eating up an ever larger share of overall medical costs; it’s now over $350 billion annually, which is about 10 percent of what the government calls the “national health expenditure.” Indeed, drug sales are close to 2 percent of gross domestic product, according to a recent report by Ravi Mehrotra of MTS Health Partners. And all the while, the Medicare-Medicaid complex, the country’s largest buyer of prescription drugs and therefore the entity with the most leverage to influence prices, has been forced to sit on the sidelines and let private insurance companies negotiate prices, which the government then has to accept. So yes, Trump’s idea of allowing the government to negotiate on behalf of its beneficiaries is a good one. Although the president appears to have pulled the $300 billion in savings out of thin air, it would indeed save significant sums. Mehrotra suggests that the government could save $16 billion if Medicare Part D prices were negotiated. There would be three other benefits: insurance companies and consumers would save money because insurers would probably use the negotiated Medicare price as their baseline. Companies would have a harder time raising prices as much as they’ve done during the last decade because the government would push back harder than the insurance companies do. And there’d no longer be an absurd, opaque system of behind-the-scenes rebates and other deals that now make it impossible to know the real price of a drug. “It wouldn’t be simple,” said Don Berwick, who was the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid administrator in 2010 and 2011. To cite one example, “CMS would have to have a formulary, like the insurance companies, so it could steer beneficiaries to a cheaper alternative if need be,” Berwick said. Still, he added, it was something the government could accomplish if it wanted. Back to Tuesday’s meeting: Trump goes into it as powerful as he’ll ever be. The executives are scared of him. (What if he tweets?!) The Republicans in Congress want to mollify him so they can get their tax cuts. Although executives and Republicans alike oppose empowering CMS to negotiate drug prices, it’s possible — it really is! — that he could make it happen if he moves quickly. “We have to get prices down,” he says at the beginning of the meeting with cameras rolling. “We have no choice.” Then the doors were closed. When they opened again, Trump had not only abandoned his promise to use the government’s bargaining power to bring down drug prices, he was now totally against it! “I’ll oppose anything that makes it harder for smaller, younger companies to take the risk of bringing their product to a vibrantly competitive market,” he said, according to the pool reporter. “That includes price-fixing by the biggest dog in the market, Medicare, which is what’s happening.” (Yes, he accused an agency that has no power to negotiate prices of “price-fixing.”) And so it was that after one meeting with pharma CEOs, Trump was turned around on his one good idea and embraced instead yet another nonsensical one.

Ryder System, a truck leasing company, fell 8 percent after reporting earnings that fell far short of what Wall Street analysts were expecting. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 6.03 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 19,884.91. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 1.30 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,280.85 and the Nasdaq composite fell 6.45 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,636.20. After a post-election rally that pushed stocks to all-time highs and the Dow above the 20,000-point mark, investors have stepped back this week. Several actions by President Trump, from his immigration ban last weekend, to his various comments on trade, have given investors some concern about whether Trump is hurting U.S. business confidence and the economy more than he's helping. "The overall economic and financial backdrop for the market looks quite good, but Trump's comments are spreading some uncertainty," said David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. Some of that uncertainty could come Friday with the government's jobs report for January. For this report, the first that will be at least partially under the tenure of President Trump, economists are expecting employers created 175,000 jobs in January, and the unemployment rate remained at 4.7 percent, according to FactSet. However some recent data, including Wednesday's ADP private sector report, has given some traders hope for a jobs report over 200,000. Clothing company Ralph Lauren sank $10.76, or 12 percent, to $77.61 after the company's CEO unexpectedly departed the company, after less than two years in the position. Stefan Larsson came from Old Navy and had been charged with turning around the iconic clothing brand. Facebook fell $2.39, or 1.8 percent, to $130.84 despite reporting results that easily exceeded analysts' expectations.

Bornstein that the president uses a prostate-related drug to grow scalp hair was not previously known publicly, according to the Times story, and appears to explain why Trump has a very low level of prostate specific antigen, or PSA, a marker sometimes used to diagnose prostate cancer. The newspaper said it had four telephone conversations with Bornstein, whose office is in Manhattan, about Trump’s overall health.  Bornstein, 69, said he takes finasteride himself and credited it with helping maintain his own shoulder-length hair. “[Trump] has all his hair,” Bornstein said. “I have all my hair.” Bornstein, who said he hasn’t seen Trump since his ascension to the presidency, first came on the public radar in December 2015, when he released a four-paragraph letter extolling Trump’s health. “If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency,” Bornstein wrote. Trump, 70, is also the oldest person ever elected to the presidency. Eight months after writing the letter, Bornstein said he dashed it off in five minutes while a Trump limousine waited for him to finish. Of course, with the revelation that Trump is taking finasteride, many rushed to warn of possible side effects ― including mental confusion and permanent sexual dysfunction.  Punchlines aside, the safety of the drug has been challenged.  “The FDA-approved pill has been called into question, with emerging research and a slew of lawsuits suggesting that finasteride may be more dangerous than previously believed,” reported Men’s Journal. “Users report that its side effects — inability to orgasm, painful erections, chronic depression, insomnia, brain fog, and suicidal thoughts — can last long after patients stop taking the pill.” Since 2011, at least 1,245 lawsuits have been filed against Propecia’s manufacturer, Merck, alleging that the company didn’t sufficiently warn users of sexual and cognitive side effects. Patients and physicians reportedly call the effects “Post-Finasteride Syndrome” because, they say, symptoms often persist after discontinuing the drug. The National Institutes of Health has added PFS to its rare-diseases database. Merck told Men’s Journal the the company “stands behind the demonstrated safety and efficacy profile of Propecia.” And of course, the disclosure about the president taking Propecia spurred many to ask: What other drugs does he take? The Washington Post noted that Trump had multiple opportunities to mention his Propecia use, but didn’t.

Depends what day they ask Few industries are getting the Trump Treatment quite like Big Pharma.   Drug stocks initially jumped after Donald Trump was elected, on the bet the new president would support the industry’s profits. Then they stumbled, as Trump publicly criticized high drug prices and the debate on the future of healthcare shifted by the day, or even the hour. And now? “You really cannot predict the unpredictable,” AstraZeneca Plc Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot said on Thursday in London on a conference call with reporters. And Soriot’s competitors at Novo Nordisk A/S cut their annual forecast Thursday, citing political risk in the U.S. Healthcare isn’t the only industry that’s been whipsawed by Trump’s sometimes improvised pronouncements. Retailers were hit by the proposal to tax Mexican imports to pay for a border wall. Airlines declined amid the chaos created by his executive order on immigration. Daily Uncertainty But healthcare, responsible for 17 percent of the U.S. economy, is unique. The government spends more than $1 trillion a year on the Medicare program for the elderly and disabled and the Medicaid program for the poor. And the U.S. plays a controlling role in the market, both in financing care and in setting rules for everything from how hospitals operate to which drugs can be sold. So the industry, a behemoth accustomed to a slower pace of change, has found itself buffeted by daily uncertainty. Your cheat sheet on life, in one weekly email. Get our weekly Game Plan newsletter. Sign Up Trump’s Tuesday White House meeting with drugmakers shows what executives and investors are facing. They were relieved that Trump appeared to back off government-set pricing for drugs after he slammed the industry in a pre-inauguration press conference. But after the meeting, Trump’s press secretary, Sean Spicer, called Trump “a top notch negotiator,” and appeared to put the pricing issue back on the table. Merck & Co. CEO Ken Frazier said he came away from the meeting with Trump thinking the government wouldn’t be using its purchasing power to negotiate down drug prices. “We did not have a conversation that led you to believe that they think the solution to that problem is secretarial negotiations,” he said today in an earnings call. “That is not perceived to be the solution to the problem.” Good Side Executives have been trying to get on Trump’s good side and quietly carve out beneficial changes. Insurers, for instance, are telling Congress they can help fix Obamacare, the nickname for the Affordable Care Act, which provides millions of Americans with health insurance. One of the proposed changes: repealing Obamacare’s tax on their industry. And Eli Lilly & Co. CEO Dave Ricks said Republicans’ replacement for Obamacare should increase access to medications and provide more choices for patients. “There’s a chance to get that right this time,” Ricks said in a Wednesday interview. U.S. health insurers and hospitals may be the industries most directly affected by the uncertainty and scant details on a plan to replace Obamacare. On Thursday, Cigna Corp. CEO David Cordani told analysts the environment was “dynamic.” Aetna Inc., an insurer that’s cut back on its involvement in Obamacare markets, said on Tuesday that the lack of clarity makes planning for 2018 difficult. CEO Mark Bertolini said there’s “no possible way” it’ll enter new Obamacare markets next year and might scale back. Still, the company would like “to help the administration transition to a new program,” Bertolini said. Little Indication Anthem Inc., which is bigger in Obamacare, said it may begin “extracting’’ itself from the health law’s markets if it doesn’t get more certainty from Washington. Even Trump’s allies are giving little indication of what will happen with Obamacare’s replacement. The president has said that his pick to run the Department of Health & Human Services, Georgia Representative Tom Price, will help craft a new law. At a Senate confirmation hearing, Price was asked whether it’s true that he’s helping Trump develop a plan. “It’s true that he said that,” Price replied, to laughter. Lawmakers have held five hearings this week on the health law’s insurance programs. And even the language they’re using to indicate their plans is changing. Some Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have started calling for Obamacare to be repaired rather than simply repealed and replaced. But when Fox News asked Ryan about it on Thursday, he backtracked. “To repair the American health-care system, you have to repeal and replace this law, and that’s what we’re doing,” he told Fox. While the White House meeting between Trump and pharmaceutical CEOs “was positive,’’ the political climate in the U.S. has grown more unpredictable, according to Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen, head of Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk. The political risks prompted Novo, the largest insulin maker, to pare its sales forecast and widen the range of its operating profit estimate for 2017. “We operate in an environment that is increasingly volatile,” Jorgensen, who wasn’t at the White House meeting with Trump, told reporters Thursday. “We just have to acknowledge the environment we operate in is less predictable from a policy point of view,’’ he said. “It’s unclear exactly what Trump is going to do. That’s true for Novo Nordisk and true for anyone else.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Bild:  AP Quelle:Handelsblatt Online Patentverluste haben das Wachstum beim US-Pharmakonzern Merck & Co gebremst. Der Umsatz sank um ein Prozent auf 10,1 Milliarden Dollar. Die neue Krebsimmuntherapie Keytruda brachte nicht den erhofften Erfolg. FrankfurtPatentverluste bei einigen Arzneien und der starke Dollar bremsen das Wachstum beim US-Pharmakonzern Merck & Co. Im vierten Quartal sank der Umsatz um ein Prozent auf 10,1 Milliarden Dollar, wie das Unternehmen am Donnerstag mitteilte. Dazu trug auch ein kräftiger Erlösrückgang bei Mercks bislang zweitumsatzstärksten Medikamenten, den Cholesterinsenkern Zetia und Vytorin, von 13 Prozent bei. In den USA verlor Zetia im vergangenen Jahr seinen Patentschutz, bei Vytorin muss Merck diesen Verlust im Frühjahr verkraften. Anzeige Im Diabetesgeschäft und beim größtem Hoffnungsträger des Unternehmens, der neuen Krebsimmuntherapie Keytruda, lief es nicht so wie von Analysten erhofft. Zwar schnellte der Umsatz von Keytruda um 125 Prozent auf 483 Millionen Dollar in die Höhe – erwartet worden war jedoch ein noch stärkerer Anstieg auf fast 509 Millionen Dollar. Der Nettogewinn vor Sonderposten sank im vierten Quartal um mehr als fünf Prozent auf 2,47 Milliarden Dollar. Mit einem bereinigten Gewinn je Aktie von 3,78 Dollar im Gesamtjahr erreichte Merck jedoch das obere Ende seiner im Herbst erhöhten Ergebnisprognose. rtrQuelle:  Handelsblatt Online Schlagworte: Anlagetipp-Aktie Aktie Merck & Co Pharmazeutika © Sie wollen unsere Inhalte verwenden?

Posted: Thursday, February 2, 2017 5:35 AM EST Updated: Thursday, February 2, 2017 5:35 AM EST By Alanna Petroff LONDON (CNNMoney) -- 1. Earnings deluge: There are so many earnings coming out on Thursday that you probably won't be able to say them all in one breath. Here we go: AstraZeneca, ConocoPhillips, Estee Lauder, Merck, New York Times, Nokia, Ralph Lauren, Royal Dutch Shell, Sony, Deutsche Bank and Vodafone are all reporting earnings ahead of the open. Shares in Germany's Deutsche Bank were sharply lower following the release of its earning report. More major firms will report results after the close, including Amazon, Chipotle, GoPro and Visa. 2. Australia and Iran in focus: President Trump's comments on Iran and Australia have put the two countries in the spotlight. Trump specifically said he would study a "dumb deal" that that U.S. had made to take in refugees detained by Australia. "The Trump twitter feed overnight included some strong language about Iran, and that most diplomatic of phrases 'a dumb deal' in reference to relations with Australia," said Paul Donovan, global chief economist at UBS Wealth Management. "Both areas may have market importance -- the former given Middle Eastern investors' apprehensions about the U.S., and the latter given shifting dynamics in Asia-Pacific leadership," he said. 3. Let's do a deal, okay?: Shares in Mead Johnson Nutrition are poised to surge at the open after the infant formula maker said it's in talks to be acquired by the British conglomerate Reckitt Benckiser, which owns a range of consumer brands, including Lysol, Clearasil and Durex. The two companies said they're in talks about doing a $16.7 billion deal, though nothing has been finalized. Meanwhile, shares in Macy's are edging up premarket based on rumors that the company may be open to being acquired. The New York Post said the firm's CEO "has recently become open to offers from potential friendly buyers." Macy's did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 4. Super Thursday in London: The Bank of England is scheduled to announce its latest interest rate decision, quarterly inflation report and meeting minutes on Thursday. Central banker Mark Carney will also hold a press conference where he'll discuss his expectations for Brexit and how it will impact the economy. This comes as the British government is set to release a document on Thursday outlining its formal negotiation plans for the U.K. to leave the European Union. 5. Global stock market overview: U.S. stock futures are looking a bit weak right now. European markets are mixed in early trading. Most Asian markets ended the day with negative results. 6.

OMG Digital, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 4 Shares SHARE TWEET EMAIL By: Philip Etemesi | 23 Hour(s) ago Dr. George Njoroge, a Kenyan scientist, and researcher has made history by becoming the first African to be granted over 100 patents by the US Patent and Trade Office. Dr. Njoroge, a Senior Scientist at Eli Lilly and Company and a Director of Research at Merck Research Laboratories, achieved this feat after discovering a combination of molecules capable of treating numerous viral infections. Speaking to The Star newspaper, the scientist explained what Africa needs to invest more in research. It is ironic that our continent lags behind in drug research, yet it is the most in need and is endowed with the necessary raw materials. Dr. Njoroge. Image: The Star He also added: We should change the emphasis of university education and put more weight on research rather than just concentrating on informational based teaching. The quality of education should be emphasised and government agencies should make sure that this is not compromised whatsoever.

By Martha Rosenberg / AlterNet February 1, 2017 Print Comments Photo Credit: Dmitry Kalinovsky / Shutterstock.com There is a reason drug safety experts recommend waiting five years before taking a new prescription drug. Before new drugs are released to the public, they are tested on a shockingly small group of people for a shockingly short period of time. Risks and safety problems, therefore, often don't emerge until millions try the drug as we saw with the withdrawn drugs Vioxx, Bextra, Baycol, Trovan, Meridia, Seldane, Hismanal, Darvon, Raxar, Redux and at least 11 others. Thanks to changes at the FDA, risks presented by new prescription drugs are heightening. Drugs that once would have been rejected by regulators due to their alarming safety profiles are now rushed through, like the blood thinner Pradaxa—already linked to more than 542 bleeding deaths. Drug approvals are also, increasingly, expedited or "fast-tracked"—like Vioxx, which "received a six-month priority review," admitted the FDA, and went on to cause 140,000 heart events. Merck's bone drug Fosamax was approved in just six months and was soon linked to esophageal cancer and deaths in medical journals. Finally, the new FDA commissioner, Robert Califf, has received money from 23 drug companies including giants like Johnson & Johnson, Lilly, Merck, Schering Plough and GSK according to a disclosure statement on the website of Duke Clinical Research Institute, erasing any semblance of a government/industry firewall. Now comes news that the high-priced hepatitis C drugs, rolled out a few years ago with great fanfare, may have been rushed to market before serious risks were identified. These Drugs Cost What? When Gilead Sciences released its hepatitis C drug Sovaldi a few years ago, followed by similar drugs from other companies, the medical and insurance industries were shocked—as were lawmakers and public health officials. A single pill was priced at approximately $1,000, which translated into $84,000 for a course of treatment. In addition to the unprecedented prices, the new "Hep C" drug rollouts were accompanied by aggressive screening campaigns to increase the user pool. Even if you have no symptoms or worries you might silently be at risk and need these drugs, said the Pharma messaging, often called "disease mongering" because it employs fear of diseases to grow customers. Pharma companies initially tried to cast the outrageous prices as recouping research and development costs but quickly admitted they were simply pricing the drugs on “value”—what a Hep C cure was “worth” in the medical system, also known as "what they could get." Even mainstream business reporters smelled a rat. Why does the same hepatitis C drug that costs $84,000 a year in the U.S. cost $900 a year in Egypt, asked Avik Roy, who writes for Forbes. "Hepatitis C patients in the U.S. are mostly uninsured, underinsured and/or incarcerated. Medicaid, the VA and our prison system bear the brunt of the cost impact, and by extension so do all of us as taxpayers," wrote Roy. Roy is right. Taxpayer-supported, state-run Medicaid programs are being depleted by the Hep C drug profiteering with 33 states having already given more than $1 billion to Gilead Sciences for Sovaldi, reports National Public Radio. Ka-ching. Lawmakers are taking notice of the apparent price gouging with both the Senate’s Special Committee on Aging and Finance Committee investigating. Possible Risks with Hep C Drugs Not Seen Before Approval Certainly, hepatitis C is serious and potentially deadly, leading to chronic liver disease and even liver cancer and cirrhosis. It takes the lives of 20,000 people in the U.S. a year and is the leading cause of liver transplants in this country. But according to a new Institute for Safe Medication Practices report, unintended liver effects may also be occurring with the drugs. In one year, between June 2015 and June 2016, 165 people who took Sovaldi or Harvoni (a competing drug) worldwide died, 524 had liver failure and 1,058 had severe liver injury. It is not yet clear if the drugs were the cause, say researchers. This is not the first safety signal regulators have received about the new Hep C drugs, which include AbbVie’s Viekra Pak, Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Daklinza and five others. Last fall, the FDA found that 24 patients with pre-existing, dormant hepatitis B infections experienced reactivation of the infections while taking the Hep C drugs. Two patients died and one required a liver transplant. The FDA promptly added boxed warnings on the Hep C drug labels about the possible reactivation of hepatitis B infections. The warnings also direct health professionals to screen and monitor patients accordingly. Thomas J. Moore, a senior scientist at the Institute for Safe Medication Practices and an author of the new report about possible safety signals with Hep C drugs, has asked what many are thinking: Does the rush to bring a new drug treatment to market come at an unforeseen cost to patient safety? Warning Creep While it is certainly true that the complete safety profiles of prescription drugs cannot be established before millions of patients use them, it is also true that both Pharma and the government often only acknowledge emerging risks when the drugs have gone off patent and all profit has been taken. The continual addition of new risks and warnings on drug labels after a drug has been approved (and often under the public radar) is sometimes referred to as "warning creep."  Warning creep is apparent with the popular drug classes statins, GERD medicines (called PPIs) and antidepressants in which disturbing side effects were acknowledged years after the drugs had been aggressively marketed and were in wide use. In some cases, warning creep risks were clearly known to the drug maker and the drug marketer anyway, like the "jawbone death" side effect that Merck scientists knew was linked to Fosamax-like drugs as early as 1977. Research published by the British Medical Journal (BMJ) in 2015 confirms that long suspected suicidal side effects associated with the GSK antidepressant Paxil were known, downplayed and buried by GSK operatives. Other times, the warning creep risks are the exact conditions for which the drug is prescribed! Paxil sometimes induces the suicides it is prescribed to prevent, and hormone replacement therapy marketed to help women appear "young" was actually linked to hearing loss, gall bladder disease, dementia, urinary incontinence and more. Thanks for nothing. Bone drugs like Fosamax are linked to (in addition to esophageal cancer and jaw bone death) well-documented cases of bone fractures, which they are prescribed to prevent. And then there's Humira. Almost 10 years ago, AlterNet reported on serious side effects and questionable marketing behind the blockbuster drug Humira. Humira maker Abbott lobbied Congress successfully in 2003 to get Humira's $15,000-a-year costs covered by Medicare by seeding seniors with freebies to whet "demand." Humira and other "biologic" drugs, liquids that have to be injected into a patient, have been a new profit center for Pharma since blockbusters like Lipitor, Nexium, Seroquel, Viagra, Concerta, Seroquel and Zoloft have gone off patent. Yet biologic drugs like Humira, many genetically engineered and suppressing the immune system, are far from safe. By suppressing the body's tumor necrosis factor (TNF) they invite tuberculosis, serious, possibly lethal infections, melanoma, lymphoma and unusual cancers in children and teenagers. As early as 2008, the FDA announced 45 people on Humira and related drugs died from fungal diseases and investigated Humira for 30 reports of childhood cancers. Nevertheless, the drug has been so lucrative, it allowed parent company Abbott to spin off an entire new company, AbbVie, primarily to market Humira. Humira clinical trials revealed allergic reactions, serious hematologic events, aplastic anemia, bone marrow conditions and more, but the drug sailed through its FDA approval. Worse, AbbVie's patient guide warns that a side effect of the drug is similar to one of the conditions for which it is prescribed: Humira is supposed to "reduce the signs and symptoms" of "psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in adults," but patients who take the drug may sustain "new psoriasis or worsening of psoriasis they already had." What? When so many safety risks emerge with expensive new prescription drugs after approval—even causing the conditions they are supposed to prevent—there is something seriously wrong with U.S. drug regulation and its march-to-Wall Street speedy approvals.

Trump told them the government was paying “astronomical” prices for medicines in its health programs for older, disabled and poor people and said he would soon appoint a new US Food and Drug Administration leader. “We’re going to streamline the FDA,” Trump said in a statement. The meeting between Trump and the pharmaceutical executives signalled a defusing of tensions that have kept drug stock prices in check since the presidential election. Shares of most of the group rallied on Tuesday following the meeting, even as the broader stock market slid. Market strategist Quincy Crosby of Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey said Trump was playing a balancing act between controlling prices and loosening regulations. “I don’t think the majority of Americans want all regulations lifted from drug makers.” Attending the meeting were top executives at Merck & Co Inc, Johnson & Johnson, Celgene Corp, Eli Lilly & Co, Amgen Inc and Switzerland’s Novartis AG as well as the head of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) lobbying group. According to a transcript of the televised portion of the meeting, Amgen chief executive officer Robert Bradway promised to add 1,600 US jobs at his California-based biotechnology company this year. Amgen clarified in an e-mail that it currently employs around 20,000 people worldwide, including 12,000 in the United States, and said the 1,600 includes new staff as well as hires to address attrition. Celgene, Lilly, Merck and Amgen said by e-mail after the meeting that they were encouraged by Trump’s focus on innovation, tax reform and the need for a more value-driven health care system. Lilly said discussion topics also included stronger trade agreements and removing “outdated regulations that drive up costs and slow innovation.” PhRMA echoed those points in its own post-meeting statement, adding that the policies, if enacted, would result in up to 350,000 new jobs over the next 10 years. “Tax, deregulation – those are things that could really help us expand operations,” Lilly CEO Dave Ricks said. Officials at Novartis and J&J did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “We have to get prices down for a lot of reasons. We have no choice, for Medicare and Medicaid,” Trump said, citing the nation’s government insurance programs for the elderly, the poor and the disabled. Trump also said currency devaluation by other countries had increased drugmakers’ outsourcing their production, and he called on the companies to make more of their products in the United States. Foreign countries must pay a fair share for drug development costs, he added. “We’re going to end global freeloading.”The United States typically pays more for drugs than any other developed nation. Most Western European countries, as well as Japan, have government-run health care coverage under which drug prices are negotiated. « Dollar rises, stocks mixed ahead of Fed decision EU clears final hurdle for end of roaming charges » Advert See our Comments Policy Comments are submitted under the express understanding and condition that the editor may, and is authorised to, disclose any/all of the above personal information to any person or entity requesting the information for the purposes of legal action on grounds that such person or entity is aggrieved by any comment so submitted.

 There's still a lot of uncertainty about what Trump will do about drug prices — here's what drugmakers are doing in the meantime Lydia Ramsey Feb. 2, 2017, 11:26 AM 709 facebook linkedin twitter email print President Donald Trump meet with Pharma industry representatives Reuters Donald Trump is sending mixed messages to the drug industry. Trump said in his January 11 press conference that drug companies are "getting away with murder." "We’re the largest buyer of drugs in the world and yet we don’t bid properly," he said at the time. "We’re going to start bidding and we’re going to save billions of dollars over a period of time." That's something the government isn't allowed to do for Medicare and Medicaid. On Tuesday January 31, Trump met with pharma CEOs, and still seemed keen to target high drug prices, calling them "astronomical." He added that he is interested in helping streamline the regulatory process drugs have to go through and in bringing back drug manufacturing to the states. The executives — and the industry — came out of the meeting with a positive impression. Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said that Trump's drug pricing policy didn't get discussed detail in the meeting, leaving some ambiguity about what the president will end up doing. Merck CEO Ken Frazier said in an earnings call Thursday February 2 that he came out with the impression that there were a few possible options, of which negotiating wasn't the top pick. "That is not perceived to be the solution to the problem," Frazier said. While waiting for the final word, some companies in the industry have stepped up their self-policing game by committing to price-increase caps, or providing more transparency about what share of the list price a company actually gets. The latest to formally put a lid on is Japanese drugmaker, Takeda.   "Takeda has for many years been reasonable in its price increases in the US and we are very committed to single-digit price increase," Takeda CEO Christophe Weber told Reuters. Pharmaceutical companies have been criticized for their routine list price increases, which are often the only numbers the public has access to. But, as many have argued, the list price doesn't tell the whole story. There are other players in the system that each take a piece, which means that what a drugmaker actually receives could be lower even as the list price rises. Some companies have opted to display their net prices on average to illustrate that point.  To recap, here's how companies have confronted drug pricing pressure: After facing heat for the increased price of the EpiPen in August 2016, Mylan broke out its net price for the device as a way to illustrate how the list price differs from what the company actually gets.  Allergan was the first to commit in September 2016 to only single-digit price increases once a year (a line the company hugged quite closely) Novo Nordisk did the same in December. AbbVie committed to only single-digit price increases, but just for 2017. Merck published a report that outlined the company's average list price increases for its products. Johnson & Johnson plans to join in with Merck in February with a report on their list and net prices on average.

The monthly US employment report was expected to show the economy added 170,000 jobs in January, with the unemployment steady at 4.7 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at 19,884.98, down less than 0.1 per cent. The broad-based S&P 500 rose 0.1 percent to 2,280.85, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index lost 0.1 percent at 5,637.20. Analysts said investors remain anxious about the emerging policies of the Trump administration following a series of controversies, most recently over a contentious phone call between Trump and Malcolm Turnbull, prime minister of Australia, a close US ally. "Investors are kind of reappraising the whole package," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank. "It isn't just going to be domestic policy and stimulus. There are some global risks along with this Trump team." Dow member Merck jumped 3.4 percent after fourth-quarter net income surged 20.6 percent to US$1.2 billion (S$1.7 billion), thanks in part to strong gains in sales of cancer drug Keytruda.

William McConnell Feb 2, 2017 4:01 PM EST Rep. Greg Walden, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, on Thursday announced plans to consider legislation aimed at speeding Food and Drug Administration approvals of off-patent drugs that face scant competition. The Oregon Republican said the bipartisan legislation would provide incentives for generic drug development.  The bill, titled The Lower Drug Costs Through Competition Act and sponsored by Reps. Gus Bilirakis (R-Fla.) and Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.), is basically a copy of legislation the pair sponsored last year. A hearing on it could be held next week, although the committee has not set a date.  "The bill will require the [Food and Drug Administration] to prioritize, expedite and review generic applications of drug products that are currently in shortage, or where there are few manufacturers on the market," Walden said. The legislation aims to create a Priority Review Voucher that would be awarded to manufacturers that bring a drug to market when there is no competition to an off-patent drug and obligate the FDA to rule within 180 days on an approval application for a qualifying drug. Walden's announcement follows Tuesday's meeting between President Donald Trump and drug company executives at the White House.  Celgene (CELG) Chairman Bob Hugin, Merck (MRK) CEO Ken Frazier and Amgen (AMGN) CEO Rob Bradaway were among the executives meeting with Trump.   The bill also comes in the wake of last year's uproar over steep price hikes of Mylan's ( MYL) EpiPen, which have averaged 25% yearly since 2007. The EpiPen is a hand-held epinephrine autoinjector used often used by patients themselves and emergency medicine workers to treat anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction, in life-and-death situations.   The industry standard on drug price increases is roughly 10% annually.     "President Trump made it clear in the White House meeting I attended with him and Vice President Pence, he wants competition that will bring lower drug prices, and that is precisely what this measure will accomplish," Walden added. The bill is also meant to prevent situations in which drugmakers suddenly increase the cost of an existing drug that doesn't have competitors. The lawmakers cited the 2015 decision by Turing Pharmaceuticals, led by hedge fund manager and "Pharma Bro" Martin Shkreli, to jack up the price of Daraprim, an antiparasitic used to treat certain infections associated with HIV. It was then that the company raised the drug's price from $13.50 to $750 overnight.

He also pointed out that competition in the drug market had dissipated, thanks to sluggish approval prices and an overbearing regulatory system. SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER “We’re gonna be lowering taxes big league, we’re going to be getting rid of regulations that are unnecessary big league,” he said. Trump met in the Oval Office with officials from Amgen, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Celgene, Eli Lilly, and Novartis. After their meeting, Trump told reporters that he would oppose road blocks making it harder for smaller drug companies to compete with larger ones. He also accused Medicare of increasing the cost of drugs. “I’ll oppose anything that makes it harder for smaller, younger companies to take the risk of bringing a product to a vibrantly competitive market,” he said. “That includes price fixing by the biggest dog in the market, Medicare, which is what’s happening.” Trump also promised to streamline the FDA, helping the industry approve drugs quickly. “We have a fantastic person that I think I’ll be naming fairly soon who’s gonna streamline the FDA and you’re gonna get your products either approved or not approved, but it’s gonna be a quick process,” he said. “It’s not gonna take 15 years.” Read More Stories About: Big Government, Donald Trump, FDA, Medicare, pharma, pharmaceuticals, prescription drugs, White House Comment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Bornstein told the New York Times in an interview published Wednesday. He also made a point of stating that the President has all of his hair. The New York City gastroenterologist also said the President is taking antibiotics to control rosacea, a skin condition that causes redness. A senior White House official says Bornstein did not have Trump’s permission to speak about his health to the Times. The physician told the Times he has had no contact with his patient since Trump became president. Trump had visited his office every year since 1980 for annual checkups, colonoscopies and other routine tests. During the campaign, Trump’s longtime physician disclosed only that he was taking rosuvastatin and low-dose aspirin to reduce his risk of heart attack. Bornstein came under scrutiny for a letter he wrote describing Trump’s physical health that concluded, “If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.” Other doctors found the letter’s conclusion unprofessional and said Bornstein had used strange wording and medically incorrect terms when referring to his high-profile patient. Bornstein told CNN in September that he was rushed for time and had patients to see when writing the letter. What is Propecia? Propecia is a lower-dose formulation of finasteride that is prescribed to men with enlarged prostate glands under the brand name Proscar. Originally, the Food and Drug Administration approved finasteride 5 mg (Proscar) in 1992 for the treatment of “bothersome symptoms in men” with an enlarged prostate, which is also referred to as benign prostatic hyperplasia. At that time, the FDA also approved Proscar to reduce the need for surgery related to an enlarged prostate and possible urine retention. In 1997, the agency approved a lower-dose formulation of finasteride (Propecia) for the treatment of male pattern hair loss, a gradual thinning that leads to either a receding hairline or balding on the top of the head. The FDA does not permit Propecia for treating hair loss in women or children. “It is a very common medication,” said Dr. Louis Kavoussi, chairman of urology at Northwell Health in New Hyde Park, NY. He added that finasteride has been around for decades, so its long-term safety has been demonstrated. The drug, which blocks the body’s production of male hormones, is in a class of medications called 5-alpha reductase inhibitors. “The effectiveness varies,” said Kavoussi, who has no ties to Merck or the companies that make generic versions of finasteride. Though some men who take it for hair loss find it “very effective,” others do not. “Same for prostate,” he said. “Some men gain quite a bit of symptom relief, other men more modest. It depends on the patient.” Possible side effects of the finasteride include decreased libido, problems with erection and ejaculation, pain in the testicles and depression. According to drugmaker Merck’s prescribing information, patients taking the drug should promptly notify their doctor if they experience changes in their breasts, rash, itching, hives, swelling of the face or hands, or difficulty breathing or swallowing. According to Kavoussi, “most men tolerate it pretty well.” Those who do get side effects simply stop taking the medicine, and the effects resolve. For some years, Merck has been a defendant in liability lawsuits regarding Propecia/Proscar. About 1,370 lawsuits have been filed as of September 30 by people who claim that they have experienced persistent sexual side effects after cessation of treatment with Propecia and/or Proscar. About 50 of the plaintiffs also allege that the drug has caused or can cause prostate cancer, testicular cancer or male breast cancer. Dr. Irwin Goldstein, founder of San Diego Sexual Medicine, is serving as an expert witness against Merck in the ligation, work for which he is being paid. He said people come to his clinic “from all over the world” for help with finasteride-associated symptoms. Many patients experience “a sudden or significant change in libido,” he said, while another common side effect is erectile dysfunction. Along with these sexual effects, Goldstein said the drug can cause problems with both mood and cognition, including harmful effects on memory and decision-making. Some patients believe they suffer from “post-finasteride syndrome,” in which their symptoms continue after they stop taking the drug. As of March 2015, the syndrome is listed on the National Institutes of Health’s Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center, with the disclaimer that this is not intended as “official recognition” of the syndrome. Still, the National Institutes of Health has sponsored studies, which are now underway, to better understand the effects of finasteride. “You don’t want people to shy away — and that’s the bad thing about lawsuits; people get the impression that something is very bad,” Kavoussi said, adding, “it’s helped a lot of men.” Merck listed 2015 sales of the drug at $183 million, down from a peak of $447 million in 2010. Other drug manufacturers began producing generic versions in 2013. Efforts to contact Bornstein for comment have not been successful.

But there are parts of the U.S. health-care system that President Donald J. Trump plans to shake up, which may present buying opportunities. Currently, health stocks are underpriced compared to other sectors of the market. "We're investing in a time of substantial uncertainty," said Marshall Gordon, director and senior research analyst at ClearBridge Investments. "Everybody is searching around for what might happen." Thanks to the uncertainty, the broad health-care stock index has fallen by nearly 6.3 percent since last August, but it is up more than 3 percent since the election. The sector, which has tended to trade at a premium to the S&P 500, is about 10 percent cheaper than the benchmark, noted Brad Sorensen, managing director of market and sector analysis at Charles Schwab. "It's not major, but when you look at the rest of the sectors, that does make it pretty attractive in a market where it's tough to find good value," he said. More from ETF Strategist: The two dangerous times during market day when investors should never trade 'This is the greatest deal in financial history' if you want to invest wisely If Dow being so high makes you want to buy low, you can't beat these market dogs The biotech sector, in particular, has seen its P/E come down from its 2015 peak. The S&P 500 health-care sector forward PE is 14.9 compared to its historical average of 19.3 over the last 20 years. The NASDAQ Biotech Index is trading at 34 times forward PE compared to 49.8 since 2009. This is not due to a lack of growth — it's been one of the better stories over the past decade in terms of earnings growth — but concerns about sector valuation amid regulatory scrutiny, said Joe Abbott of Yardeni Research. He thinks the sector remains a good opportunity. This week's meeting between Trump and drug company CEOs is a good example of the volatility that will move stocks — up and down — as the government begins to make changes. The health-care ETFs starting the year strong ETF Year-to-date return (%) 1-year return (%) YTD flows ($) Ticker SPDR S&P Biotech 9.7 27.7 (-100M) XBI BioShares Biotechnology Clinical Trials Fund 7.8 2.5 1M BBC BioShares Biotechnology Products Fund 7.7 46 2M BBP iShares Medical Devices 7 23 153M IHI VanEck Vectors Biotech 6 11.7 34M BBH (Source: XTF.com) On Tuesday, in the meeting with drug makers, Trump called on them to produce their pharmaceuticals in the United States and said, "We have to get the prices down. We have to get the prices way down." But Trump also promised in the Tuesday meeting to make it easier for pharmaceutical companies to win regulatory approval for their products. What the president was not as forceful on was drug prices. Trump had recently said drug makers were "getting away with murder" and indicated he might even recommend the government drive a hard bargain through Medicare. But on Tuesday, even as Trump reiterated that prices are too high, the market interpreted his view as now backing away from an earlier, less industry-friendly threat to allow the government to drive a hard bargain over drug prices. Biotech-focused stocks and ETFs had the largest gains on Tuesday, with the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index ETF up 3.5 percent and the S&P Biotechnology Index up 4.5 percent since Tuesday. There is a long-term reason to buy in: Americans are aging and will need more medicines and care. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 14.5 percent of the U.S. population was 65 or older in 2014. That number is expected to climb to 21.7 percent by 2040. In interviews conducted before Trump's meeting with drug companies this week, analysts who cover the sector said there are reasons to believe it could do better under Trump. Pharmaceuticals and biotechnology are less impacted by ACA changes than other parts of the market. Several big drug companies have seen their prices fall modestly this year, including Gilead Sciences and Celgene, which are down about 1.8 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively, potentially presenting buying opportunities. show chapters Merck CEO: We had a great conversation with Trump    Tuesday, 31 Jan 2017 | 10:31 AM ET | 02:33 Like with health-care reform, it's still unclear as to how Trump will approach drug pricing, and the government could negotiate some prices with companies for Medicare, but it's unlikely we'll see any major changes to the way things operate now, said Ashtyn Evans, an equity analyst with Edward Jones, in an interview before the Tuesday meeting. If anything, it will be the private insurers that do more of the negotiating, but with the outcry over drug pricing, from the public and from Trump, many companies have already taken a more modest approach to price increases, Evans said. Longer-term, more Americans will need more medicines, and a number of innovative drugs for Alzheimer's, cancer and other diseases are being developed now. That won't change under Trump. In fact, more drugs could get approved — Sorensen thinks the U.S. Food and Drug Administration may be less stringent on approvals under the new president. "He has talked about easing regulations of all sorts, and those could include the drug industry," Sorensen said, referring to comments that predated Tuesday's meeting. "That should help profitability."

She has a buy rating on pharma company Merck, which has several product lines, including drugs for animals, which isn't impacted by the ACA, and it's been developing a promising cancer drug, Keytruda, that use the body's immune system to fight the disease. "It's not reliant on government reimbursements or private payers," she said. Year-to-date, Merck is up 3.1 percent. In earnings reported on Thursday morning, Merck presented earnings that were mostly in line with estimates but did say it thinks worldwide sales will be flat in 2017 compared to last year. Shares rose by close to 3 percent after the report. No matter what one buys, though, it's going to be a rocky ride for a while. Investors need to have the strength to hang on to their stocks, but eventually things will calm down and prices will rise. It's not unlike what the industry saw after the now former president Obama took office in 2008. "Remember, there was terrible uncertainty in 2008, but these stocks have done phenomenally well," said ClearBridge Investments' Gordon.

(Nasdaq:CYTK) and Royalty Pharma today announced that Cytokinetics has agreed to sell to Royalty Pharma a portion of the potential royalty due to Cytokinetics from Amgen on worldwide sales of omecamtiv mecarbil. Cytokinetics has also agreed to exercise its option to co-invest with Amgen in the Phase 3 development program of omecamtiv mecarbil in exchange for increased royalties from Amgen on worldwide sales of omecamtiv mecarbil outside Japan and co-promotion rights.   Cytokinetics sold to Royalty Pharma a 4.5 percent royalty on potential worldwide sales of omecamtiv mecarbil for $90 million in an upfront cash payment. The royalty rate purchased may increase up to an additional 1 percent under certain circumstances. In addition, Royalty Pharma has agreed to purchase $10 million of Cytokinetics’ common stock.  Cytokinetics has also agreed with Royalty Pharma to exercise its option to co-invest $40 million in the Phase 3 development program of omecamtiv mecarbil under its collaboration with Amgen.

About Omecamtiv Mecarbil and Amgen Collaboration Omecamtiv mecarbil is a novel cardiac myosin activator. Cardiac myosin is the cytoskeletal motor protein in the cardiac muscle cell that is directly responsible for converting chemical energy into the mechanical force resulting in cardiac contraction. Cardiac myosin activators are thought to accelerate the rate-limiting step of the myosin enzymatic cycle and shift the enzymatic cycle in favor of the force-producing state. Preclinical research has shown that cardiac myosin activators increase contractility in the absence of changes in intracellular calcium in cardiac myocytes. In 2006, Amgen and Cytokinetics entered into a strategic alliance to discover, develop, and commercialize novel small molecule therapeutics designed to activate cardiac muscle for the potential treatment of heart failure. Initially, following Amgen’s option exercise in 2009, the collaboration was worldwide, excluding Japan. The companies expanded the collaboration in 2013 to provide Amgen with worldwide rights to develop and commercialize omecamtiv mecarbil and related compounds subject to development and commercial participation rights of Cytokinetics. Omecamtiv mecarbil is being developed by Amgen in collaboration with Cytokinetics. Amgen holds an exclusive, worldwide license to omecamtiv mecarbil and related compounds, subject to Cytokinetics’ specified development and commercialization rights. Amgen has also entered an alliance with Servier for exclusive commercialization rights in Europe as well as the Commonwealth of Independent States, including Russia. Servier contributes funding for development and provides strategic support to the program. Last month, Cytokinetics announced the start of GALACTIC-HF (Global Approach to Lowering Adverse Cardiac Outcomes Through Improving Contractility in Heart Failure), the Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes trial of omecamtiv mecarbil which is being conducted by Amgen, in collaboration with Cytokinetics.

JOHNSON, AP Medical Writer Updated: Feb 2, 2017 - 1:11 PM Twtter KENILWORTH, N.J. - Profits at the drugmaker Merck surged in the fourth quarter, and the company CEO told investors that a "constructive" meeting with President Donald Trump focused on reducing taxes and relaxing regulations. Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier on Thursday said he's encouraged by an initial meeting he and other pharmaceutical executives had Tuesday with Trump, who has said drugmakers have been "getting away with murder" on drug prices. The pharmaceutical industry has come under fire in recent months over soaring drug prices, which have been blasted by patients, doctors, politicians and others. Drug companies and investors have been alternatively worried that the Trump administration and Congress will move to reduce prices, and cheered by hopes that they will help them increase profits by reducing taxes and reducing regulations so they can bring new drugs to market faster. On a conference call to discuss Merck's latest financial results, Frazier told analysts the meeting with Trump focused on possible changes to U.S. tax laws, removing "outdated" regulations and using market forces to make medicines more affordable. "What I heard from Mr. Trump was a concern less around the costs of drugs in the aggregate," and more about affordability for patients and finding a way for them to share in the sizeable discounts insurers and other payers negotiate with drugmakers, Frazier said. He said more meetings with Trump are expected, and that while he expects Congress to introduce bills calling for government price negotiations or controls, he doesn't think that's widely seen as a solution. Merck's fourth quarter profit surged 21 percent on the strength of aggressive cost-cutting and sales of two new drugs, the cancer medicine Keytruda and the hepatitis C treatment Zepatier. Keytruda is among the most successful of a new generation of cancer medicines that work by helping the immune system fight tumors. Launched in September 2014 for advanced skin cancer, Keytruda has since been approved for treating lung cancer - a much bigger market - plus head and neck cancer. Keytruda had sales of $483 million in the quarter and $1.4 billion over 2016, and could get U.S. approval in March for two other tumor types. Edward Jones analyst Ashtyn Evans wrote to investors that she expects annual Keytruda sales to reach $7 billion by 2020. Zepatier was launched early last year in the crowded field of new drugs that cure hepatitis C. It brought in $229 million in fourth-quarter sales, putting it on pace to possibly hit $1 billion in sales this year. Strong sales of those and other drugs, plus the cost cuts, helped Merck overcome the ongoing drag of lower revenues from older drugs, especially ones that are starting to face competition from generics, like the cholesterol pill Zetia and the allergy spray Nasonex. That will continue, as a big-selling cholesterol drug, Vytorin, will soon face cheaper copycats. Merck, the country's second-biggest drugmaker, reported fourth-quarter net income of $1.18 billion, or 42 cents per share. Excluding one-time costs, earnings were 89 cents per share, a penny better than industry analysts had projected. Sales dipped 1 percent to $10.12 billion, just shy of Wall Street forecasts for $10.2 billion. Merck shares jumped $1.75, or 3 percent, to $63.85 in midday trading. The Kenilworth, New Jersey, company expects full-year earnings in the range of $2.47 to $2.62 per share, with revenue of $38.6 billion to $40.1 billion - just a tad below what analysts were expecting. For all of 2016, Merck reported net income of $5.7 billion, or $2.04 per share, on revenue of $39.8 billion. BernsteinResearch analyst Tim Anderson called the 2017 forecasts "a relief," given Merck's prior cautionary language and what its rivals have been predicting for 2017. ___ Follow Linda A.

PD-L1 inhibitor Tecentriq (atezolizumab) brought in CHF 157m in 2016 - almost all from the US - which compensated for a 5% decline in Avastin (bevacizumab) sales to $2.96bn in the US. Strong international growth helped Avastin remain flat at just under CHF 6.8bn for the year, but with biosimilar competition looming Roche needs its newer drugs to deliver. Tecentriq now has around 60% penetration in bladder cancer - its first approved indication - and according to Roche's pharma head Daniel O'Day has rapidly become the standard of care in the second-line setting and some first-line patients. At the end of April, the company will hear from the FDA on a broad first-line label for the drug. Roche indicated it was too early to talk about market share, although Bristol-Myers Squibb conceded in its fourth-quarter presentation that Tecentriq was impacting its rival checkpoint inhibitor Opdivo (nivolumab) in second-line NSCLC. Tecentriq was approved as a second-line treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in October and got off to "a good start" in the last couple of months of 2016, O'Day added. Regulatory verdicts in first-line NSCLC are due in the coming months, allowing it to compete head-to-head with Merck & Co's Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in that setting. Roche is hoping that while Avastin is likely to see some cannibalisation of sales from Tecentriq, combination use could support its older drug. It will shortly start a trial of the PD-L1 inhibitor in combination with chemotherapy for first line lung cancer - with and without Avastin. Overall, Roche reported a 3% increase in pharma sales to CHF 39bn, and the company is expecting low- to mid-single digit sales growth this year. Along with Tecentriq and other new drugs such as targeted lung cancer drug Alecensa (alectinib), the company is hoping for approval of two new drugs - delayed multiple sclerosis treatment Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) and emicizumab for haemophilia A. Roche is expecting some pressure in 2017 thanks in part to the loss of US patent protection for influenza drug Tamiflu (oseltamivir) in December 2016, exposing around $500m of the brand's $800m annual sales to generic competition.

Following is a summary of current health news briefs. UK agency says Pfizer breast cancer drug too expensive Pfizer's breast cancer drug Ibrance, or palbociclib, is too expensive to justify its use on Britain's state-run health service, the country's healthcare cost-effectiveness watchdog said on Friday. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said in draft guidance that although the medicine was likely to offer some improvement in overall survival, this could not be quantified from clinical trials. Maternity, paternity leave rates in the U.S. remain low The proportion of U.S. women taking maternity leave has remained about the same for the past two decades, according to a new study. Laws mandating paid leave in four states and an expanding national economy have had no impact on the proportion of working women who take maternity leave, which remains at about 678 per 10,000 births, an economist reports in the American Journal of Public Health. Hungary orders all poultry to be kept inside to contain bird flu Hungary's chief veterinarian has issued an order that all poultry must be kept inside after the bird flu virus spread to 11 counties and more than 3 million birds had to be culled. The food safety authority NEBIH said in a statement on Thursday the aim was to limit the possibility of contact between wildfowl and poultry stock. U.S. House panel to take up bill to spur generic drug development A U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee will take up bipartisan legislation next week to foster generic drug development, the committee's chairman, Representative Greg Walden, said on Thursday. "President (Donald) Trump made it clear ... he wants competition to lower drug prices, and that is precisely what this measure will help accomplish," Walden, a Republican from Oregon, said at a health subcommittee hearing. Fat shaming tied to increased risk of metabolic problems Obese people who feel stigmatized about their size are not only more likely to struggle with weight loss, they're also more likely to develop cardiovascular disease and metabolic disorders, a new study suggests. In many cultures, people who are obese are viewed as stereotypically lazy, lacking in willpower, incompetent, unattractive and personally responsible for their excess weight, researchers note in the journal Obesity. These negative beliefs, known as weight bias, can cause obese people to experience discrimination, which is in turn associated with an increased risk of "internalizing disorders" like depression, anxiety and low self-esteem, previous research has found. Opioid addiction implant maker Braeburn Pharma pulls IPO Braeburn Pharmaceuticals Inc, the maker of the first long-acting implant to treat opioid addiction in the United States, said on Thursday that it had decided not to proceed with its initial public offering, citing current market environment. The company, which filed to go public in late December, was expected to offer about 7.7 million shares in the price range of $18-$21 per share. http://bit.ly/2jAS1vV Amgen cholesterol drug succeeds in cutting serious heart problems: study Amgen Inc said its potent cholesterol fighter Repatha significantly reduced the risk of heart attacks, strokes and death in patients with heart disease, according to initial results of a large, eagerly-anticipated trial released on Thursday. The data should pave the way for greater acceptance by health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, who have been rejecting about 75 percent of prescriptions written for the expensive medicine despite multiple appeals by physicians. No new safety problems cropped up in the 27,500 patient study called Fourier, Amgen said. It also said Repatha's effect on mental function was similar to placebo, likely alleviating concerns that it might impair cognition in some patients. U.S. FDA approves Bristol-Myers' Opdivo for bladder cancer The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday expanded the use of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's Opdivo to include treatment of urothelial carcinoma, the most common type of bladder cancer. Opdivo, part of a new class of medicines designed to use the body's own immune system to fight cancer, is already approved to treat advanced melanoma, a form of lung cancer, kidney cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma. 'Heading' in soccer may lead to concussion symptoms Purposely "heading" a soccer ball may lead to concussion symptoms despite research suggesting those issues mainly arise from accidental knocks to the head, according to a new study. While amateur soccer players were at an increased risk of concussion-like symptoms from colliding with each other and objects, they also had an increased risk for those symptoms if they often used their head to hit the ball - an action known as heading. Merck 2017 forecast reassuring; full-speed ahead with Keytruda Merck & Co Inc, faced with patent expirations and increasing development costs for its high-profile Keytruda cancer immunotherapy, reassured investors on Thursday with a 2017 profit forecast roughly in line with Wall Street expectations. Shares of Merck were up nearly 3 percent at $63.90 after the U.S. drugmaker also reported fourth-quarter earnings that matched analysts' expectations.

Trump also blasted foreign countries, which he said have been "freeloading" on the United States with price controls that limit what their own citizens can be charged for medications. "We have to get the prices down," Trump said. "We have to get the prices way down." "We have to get lower prices, we have to get even better innovation, and I want you to move your companies back to the United States," Trump said. "I want you to manufacture in the United States." Related: What's to Blame for High Drug Costs? Trump also said he wanted to make it easier for pharmaceutical companies to win regulatory approval for their products. "You're going to get your prices either approved, or not approved," the president said. "But it's going to be a quick process. It's not going to take 15 years." The meeting included the CEOs of Merck, Amgen, Eli Lilly, Novartis, Johnson & Johnson, as well as the head of the trade group PhRMA. In remarks to reporters while flanked by those CEOs, Trump said, "The U.S. drug companies have produced extraordinary results for our country, but the prices have been astronomical for our country."

Few industries are getting the Trump Treatment quite like Big Pharma. Drug stocks initially jumped after Donald Trump was elected, on the bet the new president would support the industry’s profits. Then they stumbled, as Trump publicly criticized high drug prices and the debate on the future of healthcare shifted by the day, or even the hour. And now? “You really cannot predict the unpredictable,” AstraZeneca Plc Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot said on Thursday in London on a conference call with reporters. And Soriot’s competitors at Novo Nordisk A/S cut their annual forecast Thursday, citing political risk in the U.S. Healthcare isn’t the only industry that’s been whipsawed by Trump’s sometimes improvised pronouncements. Retailers were hit by the proposal to tax Mexican imports to pay for a border wall. Airlines declined amid the chaos created by his executive order on immigration. Daily Uncertainty But healthcare, responsible for 17 percent of the U.S. economy, is unique. The government spends more than $1 trillion a year on the Medicare program for the elderly and disabled and the Medicaid program for the poor. And the U.S. plays a controlling role in the market, both in financing care and in setting rules for everything from how hospitals operate to which drugs can be sold. So the industry, a behemoth accustomed to a slower pace of change, has found itself buffeted by daily uncertainty. Trump’s Tuesday White House meeting with drugmakers shows what executives and investors are facing. They were relieved that Trump appeared to back off government-set pricing for drugs after he slammed the industry in a pre-inauguration press conference. But after the meeting, Trump’s press secretary, Sean Spicer, called Trump “a top notch negotiator,” and appeared to put the pricing issue back on the table. Merck & Co. CEO Ken Frazier said he came away from the meeting with Trump thinking the government wouldn’t be using its purchasing power to negotiate down drug prices. “We did not have a conversation that led you to believe that they think the solution to that problem is secretarial negotiations,” he said today in an earnings call. “That is not perceived to be the solution to the problem.” First « 1 2 3 » Next To read more stories , click here Loading Other Articles... « Previous Article | Next Article » 0 Comments Login in order to post a comment Quick Poll For the most part, do you support President Trump's travel ban?

The report covers the market landscape and its growth prospects over the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market.   (EMAILWIRE.COM, February 02, 2017 ) Multiple myeloma is an abnormal growth and accumulation of plasma cells in the bone marrow leading to malignancy. This can be caused by the overproduction of monoclonal immunoglobulins such as IgG, IgA, IgD, or IgE; or Bence-Jones protein. Under normal conditions, stem cells develop into B lymphocytes, mature in the lymph nodes, and are transported throughout the body. On the entry of foreign substances into the body, these B-cells develop into plasma cells and produce immunoglobulins against the disease. However, in multiple myeloma, the B-cells are damaged and give rise to many malignant plasma cells that produce excessive immunoglobulins of a single type, which the body does not require. Publisher's analysts forecast the global multiple myeloma drugs market to grow at a CAGR of 9.19% during the period 2017-2021.

Opdivo, part of a new class of medicines designed to use the body's own immune system to fight cancer, is already approved to treat advanced melanoma, a form of lung cancer, kidney cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma. Investors were disappointed last month when Bristol-Myers said it would not seek accelerated FDA approval for a combination of Opdivo and another immunotherapy, Yervoy, as an initial treatment for lung cancer. The FDA is slated to decide in May whether to approve rival Merck & Co Inc's combination of immunotherapy Keytruda and chemotherapy for first-line lung cancer.

Greaves. Related articles Black History Month: Dr Wayne L.... Abstinence works against AIDS Prince Harry and Rihanna take public... WAYNE LAMAR GREAVES, originally from Church Hill, St Lucy, was always interested in science and why things worked the way they did. As a student at Harrison College he was fond of catching frogs and dissecting them in biology class. His father, late director of Greaves Funeral Home, supported and encouraged him to seek a career in medicine. As a boy, in the 1950s and 1960s, he recalled the long wait times for patients at the QEH’s casualty department and the limited medical services in Barbados. This was a key factor that led him to pursue a career in medicine. He wanted to help make things better for people who were ill and needed a doctor; people who were poor and suffering. Pursue studies The former Harrisonian left Barbados to pursue his studies at Mc Gill University in Montreal, Canada. There, he completed his undergraduate studies graduating with first-class honours. He then entered the faculty of medicine graduating with the MDCM and moved to the United States where he spent two years at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. There, he completed a fellowship in infectious diseases before moving to Atlanta, Georgia, spending three years at the Centres for Disease Control (CDC) as a visiting scientist tracking vaccine preventable diseases and sexually transmitted diseases. “Then along came HIV/AIDS,” said Greaves. “It was a new disease that was unknown and puzzling to scientists.” This coincided with his move to Howard University College of Medicine in Washington, DC where he spent the next decade as a consultant in infectious diseases caring for AIDS patients, conducting HIV/AIDS research and serving as the first head of the university’s AIDS Clinical Trials Unit. “Much has changed since then,” he said. “In those days, there was only one pill available and patients would set their alarm clocks to be sure they took their pill exactly every four hours. Unfortunately, the effect of the pills lasted only about six months. Today we have powerful drugs and cocktails combined in a single pill taken once a day and patients live for decades and more. “In those early days, there was also considerable denial that AIDS was a problem affecting the African American community. It was seen as a gay, white man’s disease and wasn’t talked about. Discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS was rampant, even vitriolic at times.” While at Howard University, Greaves developed AIDS outreach and treatment programmes as well as training programmes for medical professionals working with HIV/AIDS not only in the US but in Malawi, Zimbabwe, Kenya and South Africa. He has served with distinction on several US government advisory panels and committees including the US Food and Drug Administration, Antiviral Advisory Committee and various review committees of the National Institutes of Health. In 1997, he joined Schering-Plough Corporation’s Research Institute in Kenilworth, New Jersey. In his capacity, he directed research at facilities in the United States and abroad and interacted with affiliated laboratories around the world, pursuing new and innovative treatments for the HIV virus. In 2006, while serving as senior director of clinical research at Schering-Plough, he was honoured with the President’s Award for his contribution to AIDS research. He was described by the task force on AIDS as an “internationally renowned clinical scholar/researcher” and was cited for his work in the United States’ Africa American community. He was the first researcher to publicly warn that Blacks were suffering a disproportionately heavy burden from AIDS and urged federal officials to do more to reach African Americans with information and services. Greaves, has now moved on from HIV/AIDS to another exciting and challenging are of research. He is now a distinguished scientist with Merck Research Laboratories in Rahway, New Jersey. His focus is on the hepatitis C virus which affects 170 million people worldwide and is a major cause of cirrhosis of the liver and cancer of the liver. Until recently, the only treatment involved daily or weekly injections of interferon along with a pill for six to 12 months but only 30 to 40 per cent of patients would respond. Newer drugs, including the two-drug combination pill he is helping develop, can cure 90 per cent of hepatitis C patients as a single pill, taken once a day for 12 weeks; and research is continuing to try to shorten the treatment even further – perhaps six or eight weeks. “The pace of research and progress in the hepatitis C field has been absolutely breathtaking,” Greaves said, “and unlike the case for HIV, we can actually cure patients with hepatitis C.” Print JOIN THE DISCUSSION Dos and Donts Welcome to our discussion forum here on nationnews.com.

The report is expected to show that employment increased by 175,000 jobs in January after climbing by 156,000 jobs in December. The unemployment rate is expected to hold at 4.7 percent. Continued uncertainty about the impact of President Donald Trump's policies may also weigh on the markets in early trading. Reports of a contentious call between Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull have raised some concerns about relations with key allies under the new administration. After failing to sustain an initial upward move, stocks turned in a relatively lackluster performance over the course of the trading session on Wednesday. The major averages spent much of the day lingering near the unchanged line before closing modestly higher. The tech-heavy Nasdaq outperformed its counterparts, climbing 27.86 points or 0.5 percent to 5,642.65. The Dow inched up 26.85 points or 0.1 percent to 19,890.94 and the S&P 500 crept up 0.68 points or less than a tenth of a percent to 2,279.55. The higher close by the major averages came following the Federal Reserve's widely expected decision to leave interest rates unchanged. The Fed's accompanying statement was little changed from the previous meeting, with the central bank noting that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace. The statement did include a new sentence indicating that measures of consumer and business sentiment have improved of late. The Fed reiterated that the path of the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. Early in the session, significant buying interest was seen in reaction to upbeat U.S. economic data as well as strong quarterly results from tech giant Apple (AAPL). Payroll processor ADP released a report before the start of trading showing stronger than expected private sector job growth in the month of January. The report said private sector employment jumped by 246,000 jobs in January after climbing by a revised 151,000 jobs in December. Economists had expected an increase of about 168,000 jobs compared to the addition of 153,000 jobs originally reported for the previous month. A separate report from the Institute for Supply Management showed growth in the manufacturing sector accelerated to the fastest rate in over two years in the month of January. The ISM said its purchase managers index rose to 56.0 in January from a revised 54.5 in December, with a reading above 50 indicating growth in the manufacturing sector. Economists had been expecting the index to inch up to 55.0. With the bigger than expected increase, the ISM's manufacturing index reached its highest level since November of 2014. Despite the pullback by the broader markets, shares of Apple surged up by 6.1 percent after the iPhone and iPad maker reported fiscal first quarter results that exceeded analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Commodity, Currency Markets Crude oil futures are inching up $0.09 to $43.97 a barrel after jumping $1.07 to $53.88 a barrel on Wednesday. An ounce of gold is trading at $1,227, up $18.70 from the previous session's close of $1,208.30. On Wednesday, gold fell $3.10. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 112.27 yen compared to the 113.25 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Wednesday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.0813 compared to yesterday's $1.0769. Asia Asian stocks moved mostly lower on Thursday, with a firmer yen sending Japanese shares tumbling while markets elsewhere finished on a lackluster note amid uncertainty about what U.S. President Donald Trump means for the global economy. Japanese shares gave up early gains as the yen resumed its uptrend and Toyota Motor led carmakers lower after reporting weak monthly sales in the U.S. The Nikkei 225 Index fell 233.50 points or 1.22 percent to 18,914.58, the lowest level in more than a week, while the broader Topix index closed 1.14 percent lower at 1,510.41. Casio Computer plunged 5.6 percent after its operating profit for the April-December period dropped 39.1 percent. Toyota Motors lost 1.8 percent after reporting an 11 percent drop in its January U.S. auto sales. Sony dropped 1.2 percent and Panasonic fell 1.5 percent before reporting their earnings after the market close. Mitsubishi Electric plummeted as much as 5.5 percent after its third-quarter net income declined 22 percent from last year. Meanwhile, Hitachi gained 1 percent after raising its operating profit forecast for the year through March. IHI Corp rallied 2 percent on a Nikkei report that the company may sell its 3 percent stake in Westinghouse Electric to Toshiba. In economic news, Japan's consumer confidence improved in January to the strongest level in forty months, survey data from the Cabinet Office showed today. The consumer sentiment index edged up to 43.2 in January from 43.1 in December. Australian shares reversed early gains to end modestly lower, as losses in the banking sector overshadowed gains among gold miners. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index dipped 7.80 points or 0.14 percent to 5,645.40, while the broader All Ordinaries Index edged down 7.60 points or 0.13 percent to 5,696.40. Banks ANZ, Commonwealth and NAB gave up early gains to close marginally lower. Miners BHP Billiton and Fortescue Metals Group slid 0.2 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively while Rio Tinto edged up 0.2 percent. Gold miners Evolution Mining, Newcrest, Northern Star and Regis Resources climbed 2-3 percent as gold prices traded firm on a weaker dollar. Shares of Downer EDI soared over 13 percent after the engineering group lifted its full-year earnings guidance. Broo rose 1.4 percent on news it is buying Victorian beer company Mildura Brewery for A$1 million. Betting firm Tabcorp Holdings slumped 5.3 percent after its first-half results disappointed investors. On the economic front, official data showed that Australia's trade surplus reached a record high in December on the back of a surge in coal and iron ore prices. The surplus swelled to A$3.51 billion in seasonally adjusted terms, smashing market expectations of A$2.2 billion. Another report on building permits also beat forecasts. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index slid 133.87 points or 0.57 percent to 23,184.52, while the markets in mainland China remained closed for a holiday. Europe the major European markets are turning in a mixed performance on the day. While the German DAX Index has fallen by 0.3 percent, the French CAC 40 Index is up by 0.1 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index is up by 0.6 percent. Novo Nordisk shares came under pressure after the Danish pharmaceutical company lowered its 2017 operating profit and sales growth guidance in local currency terms. German lender Deutsche Bank has also fallen sharply after posting a net loss of 1.89 billion euros for its fourth quarter on the back of litigation costs. Automaker Daimler has moved lower after saying it expects profit to rise only "slightly" in 2017. Anglo-Swedish drug maker AstraZeneca has also moved to the downside after providing cautious guidance for 2017. Meanwhile, ING Group NV shares have risen after the Dutch banking firm said its fourth-quarter underlying profit rose to 1.38 billion euros from 822 million euros last year. Infineon Technologies has also advanced after the chipmaker reported a rise in first-quarter net income and affirmed its 2017 outlook. In economic news, Eurozone producer price inflation surged in December at the fastest pace in nearly four years, driven by soaring energy costs, preliminary data from Eurostat showed. Industrial producer prices on the domestic market climbed an annual 1.6 percent following a 0.1 percent increase in November. Economists had forecast 1.2 percent rise. Separately, survey results from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply revealed that U.K. construction sector growth slowed more than expected at the start of the year amid weaker expansions in business activity and orders. The Bank of England kept its record low interest rate and monetary stimulus unchanged amid rising growth projections as the economy entered the year on a strong footing, withstanding the risk stemming from the 'Brexit' talks that are set to begin as soon as in March. U.S. Economic Reports The Labor Department released a report showing a bigger than expected drop in first-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits in the week ended January 28th. The report said initial jobless claims dropped to 246,000, a decrease of 14,000 from the previous week's revised level of 260,000. Economists had expected jobless claims to dip to 253,000 from the 259,000 originally reported for the previous week. A separate report from the Labor Department showed a continued increase in labor productivity in the fourth quarter. The report said productivity climbed by 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter after surging up by a revised 3.5 percent in the third quarter. Economists had expected productivity to increase by 1.0 percent. The Labor Department also said unit labor costs surged up by 1.7 percent in the fourth quarter following a 0.2 percent uptick in the previous quarter. Costs had been expected to jump by 1.9 percent. Stocks in Focus Social media giant Facebook (FB) reported fourth quarter earnings that exceeded analyst estimates on better than expected revenues. MetLife (MET) reported a fourth quarter net loss compared to a year ago profit, although its adjusted earnings came in slightly above expectations. Rival insurer Allstate (ALL) reported fourth quarter results that beat analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Merck (MRK) reported fourth quarter earnings that matched analyst estimates, but the drug giant's sales came in below expectations. Oil giant ConocoPhillips (COP) reported a narrower than expected fourth quarter loss amid higher oil prices and lower costs. Sotheby's (BID) appointed Adam Chinn as Chief Operating Officer. Chinn joined Sotheby's in January of 2016 through the acquisition of Art Agency. Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) announced that Fran Horowitz, President and Chief Merchandising Officer, has been promoted to Chief Executive Officer. Shares of Shutterfly (SFLY) may come under pressure after the online photo service reported weaker than expected fourth quarter earnings and provided disappointing guidance. Chipmaker Qorvo (QRVO) is also moving lower in pre-market trading after reporting better than expected third quarter results but offering a weak outlook for the current quarter. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Main Economic Events In Europe In February -- A Preview Fed Meets First Time Under New Regime – Economic Preview for Week of Jan. 30 The World's 10 Most Productive Nations, Ranked Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Metro AG Stock Down On Weak Q1 Profit; Backs FY17 Sales Growth View Scotiabank Spending $1 Bln On Digital Tech Longtime Micron Tech CEO Mark Durcan To Retire Amazon Profit Rises, But Shares Fall On Revenue Miss Netflix Program To Browse Movies With Your Mind Merck Q4 Adj.

The British pharmaceuticals group hopes that 2017 will be the earnings trough, but its recovery hinges on the success of new medicines and results from a clinical trial of a combination of two lung cancer drugs, which investors view as risky. Chief Executive Pascal Soriot reaffirmed his confidence in the trial, despite recent mixed developments in the hotly contested cancer immunotherapy arena. "Everyone is trying to read the tea leaves and a number of people are using bad tea," he said. This year AstraZeneca expects a low to mid single-digit percentage decline in revenue, with core earnings per share (EPS) dropping by a low to mid-teens percentage in local currency terms from 2016's level of $4.31. This implies that, for the first time, Soriot will miss the $4.20 EPS threshold needed to cover the company's dividend at least 1.5 times, which is one factor determining his bonus. AstraZeneca has lost exclusivity on all its top-selling drugs in recent years but believes that it is about to turn the corner. It has offset falling sales by divesting some non-core assets, resulting in fourth-quarter 2016 core EPS, which excludes some items, rising 29 percent in dollar terms to $1.21 on revenue which fell 13 percent to $5.59 billion. The consensus forecast among industry analysts was for quarterly revenue of $5.57 billion and earnings of $1.13 per share, Thomson Reuters data shows. AstraZeneca shares ended 0.6 percent higher on Thursday as investors digested the 2017 outlook, which anticipates an increased share of profits coming from asset sales and partnership income. Some analysts argue such "externalisation" revenue unduly flatters results, but AstraZeneca's finance head Marc Dunoyer said it was an integral part of the business model. Jefferies analysts said the 2017 EPS guidance implying a mid-point range of a 15 percent decline was some 3 percent below market expectations, although the revenue outlook was slightly better than anticipated. CRUCIAL RESULT Short-term financial results, however, matter less at the moment than the outcome of the MYSTIC clinical study testing a combination of immunotherapy drugs durvalumab and tremelimumab in previously untreated lung cancer patients. "Rarely has a single trial result been so crucial to a company the size of AstraZeneca," said Trinity Delta analyst Mick Cooper. Results are due around the middle of the year and Soriot stressed the trial had a range of outcomes offering different levels of commercial upside. Soriot believes the drug combination, along with recently approved cancer pills Tagrisso and Lynparza, will help transform AstraZeneca's business, keeping it on track for annual sales above $40 billion by 2023, from $23 billion in 2016. "It is an exciting time as we rapidly approach the inflection point for our anticipated return to long-term growth," he said. Still, the AstraZeneca's immunotherapy play remains a big uncertainty and recent developments have dented some investors' confidence. AstraZeneca last month tweaked the design of MYSTIC in a move seen as potentially signalling a more cautious approach, and two days later Bristol-Myers Squibb decided not to seek accelerated approval for its very similar two-drug combination. Merck & Co, meanwhile, surprised on the upside by securing a speedy review for a rival combination based on chemotherapy. The recent exit of several senior executives from AstraZeneca has added to shareholder nervousness, with its head of Europe operations and head of oncology both quitting in the past two months.

Send me a copy:   http://mybs.in/2UTKBIF ALSO READ Astrazeneca Pharma India standalone net profit rises 288.60% in the June 2016 quarter Astrazeneca Pharma India reports standalone net profit of Rs 0.79 crore in the September 2016 quarter AstraZeneca tanks almost 11% on termination notice for Meronem AstraZeneca to stop selling antibiotic Meronem in India AstraZeneca gets 6-mth extension to sell Meronem in India By Ben Hirschler LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca warned on Thursday that profit and revenue would both fall this year as cheap generic versions of its cholesterol drug Crestor continue to hit sales. The British pharmaceuticals group hopes that 2017 will be the earnings trough, but its recovery hinges on the success of new medicines and results from a clinical trial of a combination of two lung cancer drugs, which investors view as risky. This year it expects a low to mid single-digit percentage decline in revenue, with core earnings per share (EPS) declining by a low to mid-teens percentage in local currency terms from 2016's level of $4.31. This implies that, for the first time, Chief Executive Pascal Soriot will miss the $4.20 EPS threshold needed to cover the company's dividend at least 1.5 times, which is one factor determining his bonus. AstraZeneca has lost exclusivity on all its top-selling drugs in recent years but believes that it is about to turn the corner. It has offset falling sales by divesting some non-core assets, resulting in fourth-quarter 2016 core EPS, which excludes some items, rising 29 percent in dollar terms to $1.21 on revenue which fell 13 percent to $5.59 billion. The consensus forecast among industry analysts was for quarterly revenue of $5.57 billion and earnings of $1.13 per share, Thomson Reuters data shows. AstraZeneca shares fell 1 percent as investors digested the 2017 outlook, which anticipates an increased proportion of profits coming from asset sales and partnership income. Some analysts argue such "externalisation" revenue unduly flatters results, but AstraZeneca's finance head Marc Dunoyer said it was an integral part of the business model and it would continue to contribute as the firm's drug portfolio is pruned. Jefferies analysts said the 2017 EPS guidance implying a mid-point range of a 15 percent decline was some 3 percent below market expectations, although the revenue outlook was slightly better than anticipated. CRUCIAL RESULT Short-term financial results, however, matter less at the moment than the outcome of the MYSTIC clinical study testing a combination of immunotherapy drugs durvalumab and tremelimumab in previously untreated lung cancer patients. "Rarely has a single trial result been so crucial to a company the size of AstraZeneca," said Trinity Delta analyst Mick Cooper. Results are due around the middle of the year. Soriot told reporters the trial was "not binary", since it could show durvalumab works on its own in a minority of people, even if the combination doesn't work for all patients as hoped. Soriot is betting that the cocktail, together with recently approved cancer pills Tagrisso and Lynparza, will mean billions of dollars in sales and transform AstraZeneca's business. "It is an exciting time as we rapidly approach the inflection point for our anticipated return to long-term growth," he said. Still, the dual-immunotherapy combination faces a competitive marketplace and recent developments have dented some investors' confidence. AstraZeneca last month tweaked the design of MYSTIC in a move seen as potentially signalling a more cautious approach, and two days later Bristol-Myers Squibb decided not to seek accelerated approval for its very similar two-drug combination. Merck & Co, meanwhile, surprised on the upside by securing a speedy review for a rival combination based on chemotherapy. The recent exit of several senior executives from AstraZeneca has added to shareholder nervousness, with its head of Europe operations and head of oncology both quitting in the past two months.

This year it expects a low to mid single-digit percentage decline in revenue, with core earnings per share (EPS) declining by a low to mid-teens percentage in local currency terms from 2016's level of $4.31. This implies that, for the first time, Chief Executive Pascal Soriot will miss the $4.20 EPS threshold needed to cover the company's dividend at least 1.5 times, which is one factor determining his bonus. AstraZeneca has lost exclusivity on all its top-selling drugs in recent years but believes that it is about to turn the corner. It has offset falling sales by divesting some non-core assets, resulting in fourth-quarter 2016 core EPS, which excludes some items, rising 29 percent in dollar terms to $1.21 on revenue which fell 13 percent to $5.59 billion. The consensus forecast among industry analysts was for quarterly revenue of $5.57 billion and earnings of $1.13 per share, Thomson Reuters data shows. AstraZeneca shares fell 1 percent as investors digested the 2017 outlook, which anticipates an increased proportion of profits coming from asset sales and partnership income. Some analysts argue such "externalisation" revenue unduly flatters results, but AstraZeneca's finance head Marc Dunoyer said it was an integral part of the business model and it would continue to contribute as the firm's drug portfolio is pruned. Jefferies analysts said the 2017 EPS guidance implying a mid-point range of a 15 percent decline was some 3 percent below market expectations, although the revenue outlook was slightly better than anticipated. CRUCIAL RESULT Short-term financial results, however, matter less at the moment than the outcome of the MYSTIC clinical study testing a combination of immunotherapy drugs durvalumab and tremelimumab in previously untreated lung cancer patients. "Rarely has a single trial result been so crucial to a company the size of AstraZeneca," said Trinity Delta analyst Mick Cooper. Results are due around the middle of the year. Soriot told reporters the trial was "not binary", since it could show durvalumab works on its own in a minority of people, even if the combination doesn't work for all patients as hoped. Soriot is betting that the cocktail, together with recently approved cancer pills Tagrisso and Lynparza, will mean billions of dollars in sales and transform AstraZeneca's business. "It is an exciting time as we rapidly approach the inflection point for our anticipated return to long-term growth," he said. Still, the dual-immunotherapy combination faces a competitive marketplace and recent developments have dented some investors' confidence. AstraZeneca last month tweaked the design of MYSTIC in a move seen as potentially signalling a more cautious approach, and two days later Bristol-Myers Squibb decided not to seek accelerated approval for its very similar two-drug combination. Merck & Co, meanwhile, surprised on the upside by securing a speedy review for a rival combination based on chemotherapy. The recent exit of several senior executives from AstraZeneca has added to shareholder nervousness, with its head of Europe operations and head of oncology both quitting in the past two months.

* Sees low to mid-teens percentage fall in 2017 core EPS
    * Q4 core EPS $1.21 vs consensus forecast $1.13
    * All eyes on mid-year results from lung cancer trial

 (Adds shares, further details on cancer drug competition)
    By Ben HirschlerLONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca <AZN.L> warned on
Thursday that profit and revenue would both fall this year as
cheap generic versions of its cholesterol drug Crestor continue
to hit sales.
    The British pharmaceuticals group hopes that 2017 will be
the earnings trough, but its recovery hinges on the success of
new medicines and results from a closely watched clinical trial
testing a combination of two lung cancer drugs, which investors
view as risky.
    This year it expects a low to mid single-digit percentage
decline in revenue, with core earnings per share (EPS) declining
by a low to mid-teens percentage in local currency terms from
2016's level of $4.31.
    This implies that, for the first time, Chief Executive
Pascal Soriot will miss the $4.20 EPS threshold needed to cover
the company's dividend at least 1.5 times, which is one factor
determining his bonus.
    AstraZeneca has lost exclusivity on all its top-selling
drugs in recent years but believes that it is about to turn the
corner.
    It has offset falling product sales by divesting some
non-core assets, resulting in fourth-quarter 2016 core EPS,
which excludes some items, up 29 percent in dollar terms at
$1.21 on revenue down 13 percent at $5.59 billion.
    The consensus forecast among industry analysts was for
quarterly revenue of $5.57 billion and earnings of $1.13 per
share, Thomson Reuters data shows.
    AstraZeneca shares fell 1 percent in early trade as
investors digested the 2017 outlook. Jefferies analysts said the
EPS guidance implying a mid-point range of a 15 percent decline
was some 3 percent below market expectations, although the
revenue outlook was slightly better than anticipated.

    CRUCIAL RESULT
    Short-term financial results, however, matter less at the
moment than the outcome of the MYSTIC clinical study testing a
combination of immunotherapy drugs durvalumab and tremelimumab
in previously untreated lung cancer patients. Results are due
around the middle of the year.
    "Rarely has a single trial result been so crucial to a
company the size of AstraZeneca," said Trinity Delta analyst
Mick Cooper.
    Soriot is betting that this infusion cocktail, together
recently approved cancer pills Tagrisso and Lynparza, will
generate billions of dollars in sales and transform
AstraZeneca's business.
    "We anticipate defining data, in particular from our
outstanding pipeline of immuno-oncology and targeted
treatments," he said.
    "It is an exciting time as we rapidly approach the
inflection point for our anticipated return to long-term
growth."
    Still, the dual-immunotherapy combination faces a
competitive marketplace and recent developments have dented some
investors' confidence in Soriot's ability to deliver knock-out
clinical data.
    AstraZeneca last month tweaked the design of its big
immunotherapy study in a move seen as potentially signalling a
more cautious approach, and two days later Bristol-Myers Squibb
<BMY.N> decided not to seek accelerated approval for its very
similar two-drug combination. [nL1N1F92MU]
    Merck & Co <MRK.N>, meanwhile, surprised on the upside by
securing a speedy review for a rival combination based on
chemotherapy. [nL1N1F10AF]
    The departure of several senior executives from AstraZeneca
has added to shareholder nervousness, with its head of Europe
operations and head of oncology both quitting in the past two
months.

The British pharmaceuticals group hopes that 2017 will be the earnings trough, but its recovery hinges on the success of new medicines and results from a clinical trial of a combination of two lung cancer drugs, which investors view as risky. Chief Executive Pascal Soriot reaffirmed his confidence in the trial, despite recent mixed developments in the hotly contested cancer immunotherapy arena. "Everyone is trying to read the tea leaves and a number of people are using bad tea," he said. This year AstraZeneca expects a low to mid single-digit percentage decline in revenue, with core earnings per share (EPS) dropping by a low to mid-teens percentage in local currency terms from 2016's level of $4.31. This implies that, for the first time, Soriot will miss the $4.20 EPS threshold needed to cover the company's dividend at least 1.5 times, which is one factor determining his bonus. AstraZeneca has lost exclusivity on all its top-selling drugs in recent years but believes that it is about to turn the corner. It has offset falling sales by divesting some non-core assets, resulting in fourth-quarter 2016 core EPS, which excludes some items, rising 29 percent in dollar terms to $1.21 on revenue which fell 13 percent to $5.59 billion. The consensus forecast among industry analysts was for quarterly revenue of $5.57 billion and earnings of $1.13 per share, Thomson Reuters (Dusseldorf: TOC.DU - news) data shows. AstraZeneca shares ended 0.6 percent higher on Thursday as investors digested the 2017 outlook, which anticipates an increased share of profits coming from asset sales and partnership income. Some analysts argue such "externalisation" revenue unduly flatters results, but AstraZeneca's finance head Marc Dunoyer said it was an integral part of the business model. Jefferies analysts said the 2017 EPS guidance implying a mid-point range of a 15 percent decline was some 3 percent below market expectations, although the revenue outlook was slightly better than anticipated. CRUCIAL RESULT Short-term financial results, however, matter less at the moment than the outcome of the MYSTIC clinical study testing a combination of immunotherapy drugs durvalumab and tremelimumab in previously untreated lung cancer patients. "Rarely has a single trial result been so crucial to a company the size of AstraZeneca," said Trinity Delta analyst Mick Cooper. Results are due around the middle of the year and Soriot stressed the trial had a range of outcomes offering different levels of commercial upside. Soriot believes the drug combination, along with recently approved cancer pills Tagrisso and Lynparza, will help transform AstraZeneca's business, keeping it on track for annual sales above $40 billion by 2023, from $23 billion in 2016. "It is an exciting time as we rapidly approach the inflection point for our anticipated return to long-term growth," he said. Still, the AstraZeneca's immunotherapy play remains a big uncertainty and recent developments have dented some investors' confidence. AstraZeneca last month tweaked the design of MYSTIC in a move seen as potentially signalling a more cautious approach, and two days later Bristol-Myers Squibb decided not to seek accelerated approval for its very similar two-drug combination.

Donald Trump & Finasteride (Propecia) Hair Growth Drug: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know Published 9:29 pm EST, February 1, 2017 Updated 5:09 pm EST, February 2, 2017 4 Comments By Jessica McBride 3k Share Tweet Share Email Follow Donald Trump. (Getty) President Donald Trump’s doctor has revealed that the president takes a hair growth drug called “Finasteride,” which is used to treat male pattern baldness, according to The New York Times. The drug is marketed as “Propecia.” The revelation sparked new interest in the drug, which can cause side effects ranging from impotence to memory loss. @reaDonaldTrunmp Side effects of finasteride include: impotence,loss of interest in sex,trouble having an orgasm, runny nose,skin rash. — Sandy Adas (@Sandy526) February 2, 2017 Trump’s longtime doctor, Harold N. Bornstein, let the news drop, the Times reported. “Trump takes a small dose of the drug, finasteride,” reported the Times, which added that “Trump uses a prostate-related drug to maintain growth of his scalp hair.” The Times reported that the White House would not comment on Bornstein’s revelation or say whether he is still Trump’s doctor. Trump’s mane of yellow hair has been the butt of jokes for years, although it’s never been revealed before that Trump allegedly takes a drug to grow it. Here’s what you need to know: 1. Trump’s Long-Time Doctor Revealed That Trump Takes More Than One Medication but Says the President Is Very healthy Donald Trump’s doctor, Harold Bornstein. (Twitter) The New York Times reported that Bornstein claims Trump, 70, takes more than one medication. In addition to the hair growth drug, the doc said in interviews that the president “takes antibiotics to help with the skin problem rosacea, and a “statin for elevated blood cholesterol and lipids,” the Times reported. Bornstein’s father, Dr. Jacob Bornstein, was originally Trump’s doctor, and the son inherited his father’s practice after his retirement. Dr. Jacob Bornstein passed away in 2010 at the age of 93. The Bornstein practice is located at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York. Trump’s long-maned doctor told the Times that he takes the hair growth drug too.

Finasteride Has a Series of Potential Side Effects, Ranging from Lack of Interest in Sex to ‘Mental Fogginess’ (Getty) As with many medications, Finasteride can potentially have side effects in some people, although, if Bornstein is right that Trump takes the drug, it’s not known whether Trump himself suffers from any. Drugs.com reports that the drug can cause “decreased sexual desire or ability.” The site warns users to contact a doctor if they suffer from any of these severe side effects: “Severe allergic reactions (rash; hives; itching; difficulty breathing; tightness in the chest; swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue); breast enlargement, lumps, pain, or tenderness; depression; nipple discharge; testicular pain.” ABC News reported that George Washington University researchers conducting a study into the drug interviewed men who “reported side effects such as erectile dysfunction, decreased sexual drive, problems with orgasms, shrinking and painful genitals, even some neurological problems, such as depression, anxiety and mental fogginess.” 3. Trump’s Hair Has Been the Butt of Jokes For Years, Which He’s Complained About Another hair joke. Donald Trump’s hair has been the butt of jokes for years. When he ran for president, the jokes increased all the more. (Twitter) Trump has complained in the past about all of the attention – and mockery – given to his hair, saying it’s a double standard. He’s also repeatedly insisted that his hair is real. He joked that he didn’t care if it rained at the inauguration, reported US Magazine, because “if it really pours, that’s OK because people will realize it’s my real hair.” His mane of hair is certainly unique. It’s also the topic of endless speculation. US Magazine reported that, since becoming president, some people believe Trump has changed his hair color from a gold-yellow to a subtler yellow-blond hue. Trump’s former hairdresser once told The Mirror that Trump uses lacquer on his hair and has long hair that he combs straight back. His hair is not a toupee, the hairdresser said, according to The Mirror. 4. Propecia Works By Blocking a Form of Testosterone That Leads to Hair Loss During the rally, a woman shouted that she loved Trump’s hair. He said it was the nicest compliment and added: “It IS my hair.” (Getty) According to ABC News, “Finasteride works by blocking the conversion of testosterone into a more potent form, called DHT, which contributes to hair loss. It was originally developed in 1992 by drug giant Merck as a treatment for enlarged prostates and sold as the drug Proscar.” The FDA approved the drug in 1997, reported ABC. 5. Trump Has Been Hesitant to Release Full Medical Records The Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon messes up GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump’s hair during Thursday’s show. (YouTube) During the presidential campaign, Bornstein, Donald Trump’s personal physician, released a letter on the health of the then candidate. The one-page letter, released in September, proclaimed Trump’s health was in top shape, but the president has been criticized for not releasing more information. He’s the oldest person ever to assume the presidency. “Over the past 39 years, I am pleased to report that Mr. Trump has had no significant medical problems,” Bornstein wrote in the letter. “Mr. Trump has had a recent complete medical examination that showed only positive results.” Jessica McBride is a Heavy contributor.

Trump also blasted foreign countries, which he said have been "freeloading" on the United States with price controls that limit what their own citizens can be charged for medications. "We have to get the prices down," Trump said. "We have to get the prices way down." "We have to get lower prices, we have to get even better innovation, and I want you to move your companies back to the United States," Trump said. "I want you to manufacture in the United States."

"You're going to get your prices either approved, or not approved," the president said. "But it's going to be a quick process. It's not going to take 15 years." The meeting included the CEOs of Merck, Amgen, Eli Lilly, Novartis, Johnson & Johnson, as well as the head of the trade group PhRMA. In remarks to reporters while flanked by those CEOs, Trump said, "The U.S. drug companies have produced extraordinary results for our country, but the prices have been astronomical for our country."
