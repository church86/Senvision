The trend builds on immuno-oncology drugs, an important new approach that harnesses a patient’s immune system to fight cancer by combining them with other cancer treatments, ranging from another immunotherapy drug to chemotherapy to radiation. Arguably, it has already reached fever pitch: There are nearly 800 ongoing and completed trials, according to a search of the federal database of clinical studies, up from about 200 such studies in the fall of 2015, according to a new EP Vantage/ Evaluate Ltd. report. Immuno-oncology drugs are being paired with “actually, literally anything,” with the intent of boosting drugs’ effectiveness, said investor Brad Loncar, who developed the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF CNCR, +2.29% “That’s one of the reasons why people believe immunotherapy is so promising — they think it might be able to be used as the backbone of many different approaches,” Loncar said. “If you can just get the immune system to kick in a little bit, you would think it would amplify everything you’re doing.” One drug that’s being closely watched in the space is Incyte Corporation’s INCY, -0.04%  epacadostat, Loncar said. Earlier this month, the company reported positive results from a mid-stage combination trial with Merck & Co.’s MRK, +0.23%  blockbuster drug Keytruda, with more detail expected at the American Society of Clinical Oncology’s (ASCO) upcoming annual meeting. Earlier this year, Incyte and Merck announced that they would expand the program to late-stage trials for four additional types of tumor, which bolstered investor confidence in the combination and raised hopes that it’ll be one of the first successes. Though epacadostat has given Incyte a high valuation, “I’m not sure that it’s warranted based on the data we’ve seen so far,” Loncar said, since most of the data is very preliminary. “In fact, I’m sure it’s not. We need to see some more data that backs up one, the rationale for making it into so many pivotal studies and two, for the huge valuation.” Incyte shares have climbed 29% in 2017 and are up 52% in the last 12 months, giving it a market capitalization of $26 billion. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.76% has gained 8% in 2017 and 15% in the last 12 months. Courtesy of Evaluate Ltd. Merck’s Keytruda has overtaken Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo in clinical trials studying cancer drug combinations, according to a new EP Vantage/Evaluate Ltd. report. Still, despite the staggering number of clinical trials in progress, few drugs have proven their effectiveness in combination. NewLink Genetics Corp. NLNK, -0.08% which is developing the same type of drug as Incyte and is also testing its drug with Merck’s Keytruda, saw its stock plunge in early April after investors questioned how much of an effect its indoximod had relative to Keytruda alone. There are also questions about immunotherapy drugs’ side effects. For example, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.’s BMY, +1.08%  Yervoy and Opdivo were approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the fall of 2015 for advanced melanoma. Results released in April suggested that the combination worked better than either drug on its own, though the company said the clinical trial was not designed to make that comparison. But Yervoy on its own can cause “serious side effects in many parts of your body which can lead to death,” according to the Food and Drug Administration prescribing information. That makes adding another drug even more fraught with risk. For its part, Bristol-Myers says it has extensively studied the drugs on their own and in combination and believes “the safety profile with the Opdivo + Yervoy regimen is tolerable and well-managed.” There are about 75 combination trials studying Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo and Yervoy drugs in various cancer types. And broader concerns have been raised about the effects these drugs have on the immune system, which may manifest some time after the treatment. One type of immunotherapy, anti-PD-(L)1 drugs, work to block proteins on cells so the body can fight tumor cells. But anti-PD-1 drugs can cause serious immune-related side effects, noted one scientific paper, that affect the endocrine system, liver, gastrointestinal tract, skin and other organ systems. A Bristol-Myers spokesperson said that “we have and continue to work closely with oncologists to ensure they are prepared to manage possible side effects using established algorithms in either the combination or monotherapy treatment settings.” Then, of course, there’s the question of price. The already-high cost of cancer treatment has risen over the years, and immunotherapy combinations could more than double those prices, experts say. Bristol-Myers’ Yervoy and Opdivo combination, for example, costs about $147,400 for patients with metastatic melanoma taking the median number of doses. The price varies by patient and length of treatment, with a wide range of possible doses, a company spokesperson said. Newer combinations could make prices a multiple of what they once were, said Raymond James analyst Chris Raymond, since they would include the cost of two expensive drugs and patients would likely be taking them for longer periods. “You don’t see a ton of people asking if [the cost of cancer treatment] is worth it because patients are, you know, alive,” he said. “We haven’t really seen people at this point take the debate to ‘what is the price for life?” But “I think you could see some people asking the question,” he said, though they’re unlikely to manifest at ASCO, which as a medical conference focuses on science and trial results. By way of contrast, Loncar said he expects drug combinations to be priced as a cocktail like HIV or hepatitis C drugs, rather than add the price of two or three drugs together, an approach which “is going to be unsustainable.” The ASCO’s annual meeting will take place in Chicago from Friday through June 6.

For example, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.’s BMY, +1.08%  Yervoy and Opdivo were approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the fall of 2015 for advanced melanoma. Results released in April suggested that the combination worked better than either drug on its own, though the company said the clinical trial was not designed to make that comparison. But Yervoy on its own can cause “serious side effects in many parts of your body which can lead to death,” according to the Food and Drug Administration prescribing information. That makes adding another drug even more fraught with risk. For its part, Bristol-Myers says it has extensively studied the drugs on their own and in combination and believes “the safety profile with the Opdivo + Yervoy regimen is tolerable and well-managed.” There are about 75 combination trials studying Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo and Yervoy drugs in various cancer types. And broader concerns have been raised about the effects these drugs have on the immune system, which may manifest some time after the treatment. One type of immunotherapy, anti-PD-(L)1 drugs, work to block proteins on cells so the body can fight tumor cells. But anti-PD-1 drugs can cause serious immune-related side effects, noted one scientific paper, that affect the endocrine system, liver, gastrointestinal tract, skin and other organ systems. A Bristol-Myers spokesperson said that “we have and continue to work closely with oncologists to ensure they are prepared to manage possible side effects using established algorithms in either the combination or monotherapy treatment settings.” Then, of course, there’s the question of price. The already-high cost of cancer treatment has risen over the years, and immunotherapy combinations could more than double those prices, experts say. Bristol-Myers’ Yervoy and Opdivo combination, for example, costs about $147,400 for patients with metastatic melanoma taking the median number of doses. The price varies by patient and length of treatment, with a wide range of possible doses, a company spokesperson said. Newer combinations could make prices a multiple of what they once were, said Raymond James analyst Chris Raymond, since they would include the cost of two expensive drugs and patients would likely be taking them for longer periods. “You don’t see a ton of people asking if [the cost of cancer treatment] is worth it because patients are, you know, alive,” he said. “We haven’t really seen people at this point take the debate to ‘what is the price for life?” But “I think you could see some people asking the question,” he said, though they’re unlikely to manifest at ASCO, which as a medical conference focuses on science and trial results. By way of contrast, Loncar said he expects drug combinations to be priced as a cocktail like HIV or hepatitis C drugs, rather than add the price of two or three drugs together, an approach which “is going to be unsustainable.” The ASCO’s annual meeting will take place in Chicago from Friday through June 6.

The trend builds on immuno-oncology drugs, an important new approach that harnesses a patient’s immune system to fight cancer by combining them with other cancer treatments, ranging from another immunotherapy drug to chemotherapy to radiation. Arguably, it has already reached fever pitch: There are nearly 800 ongoing and completed trials, according to a search of the federal database of clinical studies, up from about 200 such studies in the fall of 2015, according to a new EP Vantage/ Evaluate Ltd. report. Immuno-oncology drugs are being paired with “actually, literally anything,” with the intent of boosting drugs’ effectiveness, said investor Brad Loncar, who developed the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF CNCR, +2.29% “That’s one of the reasons why people believe immunotherapy is so promising — they think it might be able to be used as the backbone of many different approaches,” Loncar said. “If you can just get the immune system to kick in a little bit, you would think it would amplify everything you’re doing.” One drug that’s being closely watched in the space is Incyte Corporation’s INCY, -0.04%  epacadostat, Loncar said. Earlier this month, the company reported positive results from a mid-stage combination trial with Merck & Co.’s MRK, +0.23%  blockbuster drug Keytruda, with more detail expected at the American Society of Clinical Oncology’s (ASCO) upcoming annual meeting. Earlier this year, Incyte and Merck announced that they would expand the program to late-stage trials for four additional types of tumor, which bolstered investor confidence in the combination and raised hopes that it’ll be one of the first successes. Though epacadostat has given Incyte a high valuation, “I’m not sure that it’s warranted based on the data we’ve seen so far,” Loncar said, since most of the data is very preliminary. “In fact, I’m sure it’s not. We need to see some more data that backs up one, the rationale for making it into so many pivotal studies and two, for the huge valuation.” Incyte shares have climbed 29% in 2017 and are up 52% in the last 12 months, giving it a market capitalization of $26 billion. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.76% has gained 8% in 2017 and 15% in the last 12 months. Courtesy of Evaluate Ltd. Merck’s Keytruda has overtaken Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo in clinical trials studying cancer drug combinations, according to a new EP Vantage/Evaluate Ltd. report. Still, despite the staggering number of clinical trials in progress, few drugs have proven their effectiveness in combination. NewLink Genetics Corp. NLNK, -0.08% which is developing the same type of drug as Incyte and is also testing its drug with Merck’s Keytruda, saw its stock plunge in early April after investors questioned how much of an effect its indoximod had relative to Keytruda alone.

Meet the Contributors → In Maine, Making Cancer DNA Tests Free—And Asking Tough Questions Alex Lash May 31st, 2017 @alexlash @xconomy Like Us Xconomy National —  Has the era of genetic oncology arrived? Last week, the biomedical world took a notable step in that direction when the FDA said Merck’s drug pembrolizumab (Keytruda), already one of the world’s most successful cancer immunotherapies, could now treat any tumor with a particular genetic fingerprint. It was the first time a drug has been approved strictly for a genotype—a tumor’s genetic profile—regardless of the organ or body part where the tumor is growing. But the commercial tests used to decipher cancer’s genetic fingerprints are still an elite tool, often reserved for clinical studies and major cancer centers, and are only grudgingly reimbursed by insurers for rank-and-file patients. And when the tests are employed, they often raise more questions than answers—especially for doctors who don’t have the resources of cancer centers like New York’s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Boston’s Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, or Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto. Edmund Tai, who treats people with blood cancers at the Palo Alto Medical Foundation in Mountain View, CA, referred to a “knowledge gap” in a recent talk at a precision medicine conference. “Not everyone goes to ASCO”—the annual American Society for Clinical Oncology meeting taking place this weekend—“or reads the literature as soon as it comes out,” said Tai. There are efforts underway to help so-called community doctors grapple with cutting-edge genetic testing of tumors. One is using the entire state of Maine, which has America’s oldest average population. Its 1.3 million people are spread out over some 35,000 often extremely remote square miles. Mainers get 9,000 new cancer diagnoses a year, with fewer than 100 oncologists in the state to treat them. The Maine Cancer Genome Initiative, which is run by the private nonprofit Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, ME, aims to provide up to 1,800 free sequencing tests over the next three or four years, turning the raw DNA data into a report for the participating doctors. It has an $8.5 million philanthropic gift to get started. Along with the free DNA tests, the initiative will provide doctors layers of education and training, some of it to help with basic questions: Which patients are right for these tests? What’s supposed to happen when you send a test to the lab? To give doctors the same feedback and support that big medical centers provide, the initiative is also creating a virtual statewide “tumor board”—regular sessions to discuss puzzling cases with colleagues and specialists. “We want to pioneer community genomic medicine,” says Edison Liu, president and CEO of the sprawling, 88-year-old Jackson Lab—also known as JAX. Commercial sequencing tests, sold by companies like Foundation Medicine (NASDAQ: FMI), Guardant Health, and others, are meant to guide doctors who are making treatment decisions for patients already diagnosed with cancer—for example, when a cancer once in remission has returned. But the test reports are often more complicated than a simple recommendation of one drug or another. “There are a lot of data, and it’s hard to know what to do with the results,” says Julia Moukharskaya, an oncologist at MaineGeneral Medical Center, which is in Augusta, one of Maine’s more populous regions, but also has rural clinics for patients who aren’t able to travel. Jens Rueter, the medical director of the Maine initiative and an oncologist himself, says he’s had test makers come by his office “trying to sell you on the new assay.” That leads to doctors testing patients without understanding why. After a year of participation, Rueter hopes that “clinicians will order the tests with a better understanding of which patients are appropriate for testing.” (The Maine initiative will use certified tests developed at JAX, not commercial tests, but Rueter says the lessons should apply broadly.) Rueter says JAX won’t advocate for testing for testing’s sake. “Is knowing more actually better?” Rueter asks. Put another way: It seems that knowing the genomic pattern of a patient’s tumor is a good thing. But does every cancer patient need sequencing? You can’t answer that question without easier access to testing, which is why the Maine initiative offers it free of charge. Better answers will also require much more data than what Maine can provide, says oncologist Kevin Knopf. Knopf has left his practice at Sutter Health in San Francisco to focus more on Cancer Commons, a nonprofit online service to help community doctors decode tumor DNA test results. “To help all patients we think an open-source database has the most utility,” says Knopf. Instead of current tests that list a patient’s mutations and potential drugs to use, a report should rank therapies the way online travel sites rank best options. There are other reasons to make community doctors more sequencing-savvy. One big reason is uncertainty. Genetic testing is in its infancy. Despite occasional cures that come after the sequencing of a desperate patient’s tumor DNA—what Dana-Farber’s chief scientific officer Barrett Rollins described in late 2015 as “Lazarus cases”—there is no rock-solid evidence that sequencing people’s tumors leads to better outcomes. At the time, a consortium of seven cancer centers including Dana-Farber announced a cancer-data consortium called GENIE; in pooling their data, Rollins hoped one of their first efforts would study this problem. Nothing so ambitious has begun, says a spokeswoman for the American Association for Cancer Research, but the pooled data have spawned several narrower studies examining outcomes. And this study, unrelated to GENIE, lent momentum to the idea that sequencing patients improves their chances of survival, but it was not a randomized trial. Adding to the uncertainty is a growing realization that the two main tests—Guardant360 from Guardant Health and FoundationOne from Foundation Medicine—sometimes provide conflicting or overlapping results from the same patient. The evidence has so far come from small sample sizes. The most recent (and smallest sample) was a nine-patient study published last December in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Of the nine patients in the study, one showed no genetic mutations with either test. The other eight had 45 mutations; only 10 of the mutations (or 22 percent) were identified by both tests. For those eight patients, only nine of 36 recommended drugs showed up on both reports. When both tests identified the same mutations in a patient, the recommended drugs were a tighter but not perfect fit: eight of 13 drugs came up on both reports. The results, added to other studies, are raising useful questions. Researchers at the University of California, San Diego published a 168-patient study on discordance in early 2016, and they hope to publish soon two more studies with about 300 patients combined. Both studies continue to show overlap between tissue and liquid biopsy, as well as differences, says Razelle Kurzrock, director of the Center for Personalized Cancer Therapy at UC San Diego. For example, tumors evolve. The longer the gap between the two tests, the less overlap is likely, says Kurzrock. (Like Knopf’s Cancer Commons, Kurzrock wants to provide an interpretive service for doctors; she has helped form a startup from UCSD called CureMatch. Unlike Cancer Commons, it’s a for-profit venture.) Doctors are eager for more light on the subject. “This genomic discrepancy is certainly a clinical challenge that needs to be solved,” said Joshua Schiffman, a pediatric oncologist at the University of Utah. The hesitation to rely on the tests is clear from Foundation’s financial numbers. Its revenues from selling tests to practitioners fell last year to $38 million, a 22 percent drop from $49 million in 2015. Foundation received more cash last year from its majority owner Roche, which bought a nearly 60 percent stake in Foundation in 2015 and pays Foundation for R&D and other costs. Its founding CEO Michael Pellini shifted roles earlier this year, with a Roche executive taking over as CEO. Guardant is privately held and does not report sales figures, but officials say they are processing about 20,000 tests a year. It recently raised $360 million, bringing its total to $550 million. Guardant CEO Helmy Eltoukhy acknowledged in a recent interview the “challenge” convincing insurers to cover the tests for cancer patients whose doctors want … Next Page » Single PageCurrently on Page: 1 2 Alex Lash is Xconomy's National Biotech Editor.

Scroll down for video  Jupiter police have released surveillance video showing Tiger Woods (above) in jail attempting to take a breathalyzer test after he was arrested early Monday morning The video shows the 41-year-old golfer barefoot inside of the jail - he appears to be completely disoriented and slightly swaying A few minutes later, a female officer asks the father-of-two to stand up and walk a few steps towards her to take the breathalyzer test, to which he complies.  She instructs him to blow into the test several times, as it appears as though he is confused about how to do so.  'Take a deep breath in and now blow out,' she tells Woods. 'Blow out. Good there you go, keep going keep going.' She then instructs him to take a seat again, but he just continues to stand in front of her for a few moments before she says he can just stand there if he wants to.  He stands there for the next few minutes slightly swaying as his arms are behind his back in handcuffs, before he tries to walk towards the officers in the jail who tell him to keep standing in the same position and to not move. Woods can be heard asking if they can 'take off his two bracelets', as he turns around showing them the handcuffs. The female officer tells the golfer that he has to keep them on for the moment but they will be taken off soon.  Moments later he takes another breathalyzer test and is told again that he can sit down in the chair.  He then agrees to submit to a breathalyzer test and slowly walks over to sit in a nearby chair to take it. While sitting in the chair, he appears to fall asleep briefly as his head is slightly nodding before he leans it completely against the wall A few minutes later, a female officer asks the father-of-two to stand up and walk a few steps towards her to take the breathalyzer test, to which he complies. She instructs him to blow into the test several times, as it appears as though he is confused about how to do so He doesn't move, so the female officer comes to turn him around and lead him back over to the chair that's only a few steps away.    The female officer can be heard telling Woods that he blew .000 on the breathalyzer tests and that it did not detect any alcohol on his breath.  Woods had 'extremely slow and slurred speech' as shown in the disturbing video during his arrest A male officer can be heard asking Woods if he will submit to a urine test for controlled or chemical substances, to which he agrees. Woods then appears as though he's trying to get up from the seat, but the officers tell him that he can remain seated for the moment.  He appears confused as to how he can carry out the task, and asks 'How am I going to hold it?'  Officers then reassure him not to worry and they will get to that eventually and that they have to read him his rights before the 11 minute video ends. On Wednesday, Jupiter police released the shocking video of Woods moments after they found him asleep in his Mercedes Benz with the engine running in the early hours of Monday morning. Jupiter police took off his baseball cap as they administered field sobriety tests At one point he took off his sneakers and placed them under the police car and he was barefoot when trying to walk a straight line In more than an hour and a half of video, Woods is seen swaying, rolling his eyes and falling asleep as police administer field sobriety tests before he was arrested for DUI and taken into police custody. Slurring his words as he tried to answer questions from police, Tiger could barely stand up and kept weaving and bobbing, failing to walk a straight line barefoot after removing his sneakers. Police also released photos of Woods' bashed up $220,000 Mercedes Benz. The 41-year-old golfer had to be woken up by an officer and stated that he did not know where he was after first claiming he had driven from California. His speech was 'extremely slow and slurred' and he failed four field sobriety tests. He was arrested for DUI after failing four sobriety tests. He admitted he had taken prescription drugs He was handcuffed and taken away in the back of police car Woods' Mercedes had two flat tires and 'fresh damage' on the driver's side when cops found him asleep behind the wheel.  Both tire rims on the driver's side of the Mercedes had some small but visible damage, while the front and rear tires on that side were flat. There was also some minor damage to the bumper on the driver's side, and scuffs and scratches on the rear bumper. The passenger side rear taillight was also not working, according to the documents.  Woods failed four field sobriety tests according to the Probable Cause Affidavit, which was obtained by DailyMail.com - which also revealed Woods was on four prescription drugs - although he tested negative for alcohol. Cops Jupiter police have released the radio 'chatter' after discovering Tiger Woods asleep in his Mercedes with the engine running in the wee hours of Monday morning. They have also released photos of the beleaguered golfer's bashed up $220,000. Mercedes Benz Both tire rims on the driver's side of the Mercedes had some small but visible damage, while the front and rear tires on that side were flat Woods failed four field sobriety tests according to the Probable Cause Affidavit, obtained by DailyMail.com - which also revealed Woods was on  prescription drugs  The passenger side rear taillight was also not working, according to police documents The 41-year-old golfer had to be woken up by an officer and stated that he did not know where he was after first claiming he had driven from California The affidavit states that at 2:03am, Eldrick T. Woods was approached by a member of the Jupiter Police Department, who found him wearing his seat belt while sound asleep at the wheel of his $222,000 Mercedes. The star's car was idling in the middle of Military Trail about one mile from police headquarters, a deserted stretch of road at night but an extremely busy traffic artery during the day. Both his brake lights and flashers were on. After he was woken by cops, Woods - who was alone in the car - told them he had no idea where he was, according to the paperwork. 'I asked Woods where he was going to which he stated he did not know, he just likes to drive,' the arresting officer's affidavit states. Another officer said that Woods was falling asleep even after police had come to investigate his car.  There was also some minor damage to the bumper on the driver's side, and scuffs and scratches on the rear bumper Dashcam footage shows police stopping at Woods' car at the side of the road The golfing pro was ordered to get out of the car by Jupiter cops who asked him to perform sobriety tests  The affidavit states Woods was struggling to keep upright and was 'swaying and nearly lost his balance' when he got out the car The golfer later stated 'he was coming from LA California from golfing,' reads the report. 'Woods stated that he did not know where he was. Woods had changed the story of where he was was going and where he was coming from.' He then asked 'how far from his house he was,' according to the affidavit. When asked again where he was coming from and heading to, he told police he was leaving LA and 'that he was on his way down to Orange County.'  Wearing athletic shorts and a t-shirt, Woods was actually driving south, away from his home on Jupiter Island, the report notes. After a fellow cop, who was interviewing the suspect, returned to his car, he observed 'the driver fell asleep with his eyes closed and his head up against the headrest.'  Woods was described as cooperative and confused at first in the reports, which goes on to reveal that he agreed to a breathalyzer despite earlier reports. Wearing athletic shorts and a t-shirt, Woods was actually driving south, away from his home on Jupiter Island, according to police, who were not aware of what happened to the tires The affidavit also states that there were no odors coming from Woods or the car, this also despite earlier reports claiming that Woods' breath smelled like liquor according to one officer on the scene. Police say that when he exited his car, he was struggling to keep upright and was 'swaying and nearly lost his balance.' He leaned down to tie his shoes, resting his foot on the police patrol car, and 'nearly lost his balance.' 'I asked Woods if he wished to takeoff his shoes. Woods removed his shoes and left them under the front end of my patrol vehicle,' the officer said in the report. Woods appeared confused and seemed to struggle during the sobriety tests. At one point, when Woods was asked to say the alphabet backwards to check if he might be under the influence of drugs or alcohol, he instead offered to 'recite the entire national anthem backwards.' 'When asked if he understood the directions he stated, "yes, recite the entire national anthem backwards." Only after the instructions were repeated did he eventually get it right.  Woods was described as cooperative and confused at first in the reports, which goes on to reveal that he agreed to a breathalyzer and blew .000 One officer said that Woods was falling asleep even after police had come to investigate his car Eldrick T. Woods was approached by a member of the Jupiter Police Department, who found him wearing his seat belt while sound asleep at the wheel of his pricey Mercedes seadan seen in better days 'After several times of explaining the instructions he competed the task correctly,' the officer said in the report. Woods was also asked to perform a Walk & Turn first according to the affidavit, but 'could not maintain starting position,' 'missed heel to toe each time,' 'stepped off line several times' and 'used arms for balance.' Woods also 'stopped walking to steady self' at one point notes the report. He next was asked to perform a One Leg Stand, and was unable to raise his leg off the ground six inches, placing his foot down 'several times' while he tried to complete the test. The Finger To Nose seemed to confuse Woods, who despite having the instructions explained to him multiple times and claiming he understood what was being asked of him failed to complete the task as ordered according to the report. Woods also did not complete the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus as he 'did not follow the stimulus.' In total, six members of law enforcement were involved in the arrest, five of whom were on the scene of the incident at some point on Monday.  'Based on all my observations, Woods SFSTs, and statements made by Woods, I believed I had probably cause to arrest and charge Woods with DUI.' The golf pro was placed in handcuffs, placed under arrest and transported to the station where at 4am, a little less than two hours after the arrest, Woods was observed by one of the officers on the scene for 20 minutes prior to submitting to a breathalyzer. The affidavit notes that Woods' speech was 'slow, sluggish, very slurred' and his attitude was described as 'sluggish, sleepy, unable to walk alone.' Scene: The 41-year-old golfer had to be woken up by an officer and stated that he did not know where he was after first claiming he had driven from California (site of Woods' DUI arrest above) Bad news: The Probable Cause Affidavit from Tiger Woods' DUI arrest reveals that the golfer was asleep at the wheel when he was approached early Monday (Woods above in March) Woods was 'cooperative as much as possible' but 'very droopy, extremely sleepy' and had trouble keeping his eyes open.  The breathalyzer was agreed to the report notes, and the results were explained to Woods after he blew a .000 twice in the span of three minutes. He then agreed to the urine test, which was drawn at 4:40 am according to the report, and was read his rights. The results of which have not been released at the time. VICODIN Vicodin is a powerful painkiller prescribed for moderate to severe pain. It contains a mix of hydrocodone (an opioid) and acetaminophen (a less potent painkiller, like Tylenol, that accentuates the effects of hydrocodone). Hydrocodone can slow or stop breathing. Too much acetaminophen can damage the liver. The FDA warning for Vicodin says it 'may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery; patients should be cautioned accordingly.' Users are warned not to take Vicodin if: - they have taken a MAO inhibitor in the last 14 days - they have recently taken a sedative - they have a history of alcohol problems  The affidavit, which also reveals that Woods was on four prescription drugs - Soloxex [sic], Vicodin, Torix and Vioxx. The affidavit notes that Woods has not taken Vioxx this year.    Woods refused however to complete the question and answer section of the form, which involves a mix of general questions about the current date and time along with personal questions about physical aliments or any prescription drugs an individual is taking at the time.  In the Notice to Appear, Officers state that there was no indication of alcohol influence during Woods' arrest, but under drug influence marked 'unknown.' Woods, who occupation is listed as 'athlete,' is facing a traffic misdemeanor for his driving under the influence arrest and will make his first appearance in court later this summer. That appearance is a mandatory one for Woods, who must be in attendance on that date according to the notice he received on Monday. He could be facing up to six months in prison if convicted on the charge, and be ordered to pay $1,000 in fines while performing up to 50 hours of community service. Woods could also walk free if test show he took no more than the recommended dosage of his medication, which was prescribed by a medical professional. It was hard for the golfer to walk according to the report, which notes that he has undergone four left knee surgeries and four Achilles operations. Woods' first knee surgery occurred back in 1994 while he was still in college, with the teenager having a benign tumor removed from his knee. His Achilles injuries meanwhile all came around the same time his career began to spiral back in 2008, with the four operations he underwent occurring between then and 2012.  Not noted on the report is the fact that Woods has also had four procedures done on his back as well, the most recent being the fusion procedure he underwent in April.  Performing under pressure: After failing four field sobriety tests, Woods did manage to successfully recite the national anthem backwards (report above) Family: Wodds and ex-wife Elin Nordegren share custody of their daughter Sam, 9, and son Charlie, 7 (Woods and Nordegren with Sam in 2009 above) 'The surgery went well, and I'm optimistic this will relieve my back spasms and pain,' Woods said shortly after the operation.  'When healed, I look forward to getting back to a normal life, playing with my kids, competing in professional golf and living without the pain I have been battling so long.' His most recent blog post was just six day ago, and the typically laconic Woods wrote in depth about how happy he was with his surgery and his excitement about a possible return to golf. 'It has been just over a month since I underwent fusion surgery on my back, and it is hard to express how much better I feel. It was instant nerve relief. I haven't felt this good in years,' wrote Woods.  He went on to say that while it was a difficult decision to make, he ultimately agreed to the surgery so he could 'have a life with his kids.' VIOXX Woods said he has not taken this in the past year. Vioxx was withdrawn from the US market in 2004 over safety concerns that it increases risk of heart attack and stroke. A major report published by the journal Lancet found that 88,000 Americans had heart attacks from taking Vioxx, and 38,000 of them died. It is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (known medically as rofecoxib) that was once prescribed to treat osteoarthritis, acute pain conditions and period pains. Last year, manufacturer Merck & Co had to pay $830 million to resolve a class action suit with shareholders. The company has reserved $4.85 billion to settle legal claims with patients. Here is a brief timeline: - May 1999: First approved by the FDA in 1999, Vioxx was sold by Merck & Co. - December 1999: within months, a safety panel found that scores of patients had suffered serious heart problems or died - double the rate of those on a similar drug with different properties. - In the ensuing years, numerous studies found similar issues - but in that time, 20 million Americans took the drug - September 2004: Merck withdraws the drug after a large study found the clearest evidence that Vioxx increases the risk of heart attacks Woods then wrote about his career moving forward, stating: 'As for returning to competitive golf, the long-term prognosis is positive. My surgeon and physiotherapist say the operation was successful. It's just a matter of not screwing up and letting it fuse. I'm walking and doing my exercises, and taking my kids to and from school. All I can do is take it day by day. There's no hurry.' He added: 'But, I want to say unequivocally, I want to play professional golf again.' The golfer closed out the post as if it would be his last for some time, writing: 'That's about it for now. Have a great summer.'  Should he return, Woods would still be in striking distance of the two biggest PGA records, with his 79 wins just three shy of Sam Snead's record 82 and his 14 Majors four shy of record-holder Jack Nicklaus. Not one to weigh in on the personal matters of his fellow athletes, Nicklaus was forced to speak about Woods' situation due to the fact that he had a previously scheduled press conference on Tuesday afternoon ahead of the  Memorial Tournament, which he founded over four decades ago. When asked if he wanted to comment, Nicklaus responded: 'Not really.' He then added however: 'I feel bad for Tiger. Tiger's a friend. He needs all our help.'  Woods also owns a restaurant near his home in Jupiter, The Woods. The establishment offers classic American fare and drinks along with a lengthy list of bourbons, ryes, cognacs and cigars.    He released a book this past March as well,   Forbes estimated Woods' net worth to be $740million in 2016, with the golfer making $45.5million just that year in endorsements despite his lackluster play on the links.  Time will now tell if any of those big name sponsors, including Nike and Rolex, opt out of their relationship with the golfer.  Woods resigned with Nike back in 2013, but the company stopped making golf equipment last year, meaning that the athlete is being paid to wear their clothing. Work in progress: It was also hard for the golfer to walk according to the report, which notes that he has undergone four left knee surgeries and four Achilles operations (surgeries above) Rough time: Woods had difficulty signing his name (top left) and then writing in print (bottom right) on his Notice to Appear at 7:30am on Monday morning  And that is something he will not be doing for some time after his surgery.  That personal fortune meanwhile comes after Woods handed over $750million to first wife Elin Nordegren in their 2010 divorce. The couple share custody of their daughter Sam, 9, and son Charlie, 7, with the exact details of their arrangement unknown due to a seal on the court documents, It is unclear if this arrest might impact the agreement between Woods and his ex-wife. Woods apologized for his actions in a statement late Monday, while claiming that he had not been drinking prior to his arrest and believed that he had suffered a reaction to a prescription medication.

He went on to state: 'I would like to apologize with all my heart to my family, friends, and the fans. I expect more from myself, too.

Woods then closed out by expressing his gratitude for the local authorities, saying: 'I fully cooperated with law enforcement, and I would like to personally thank the representatives of the Jupiter Police Dept. and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office for their professionalism.'  Share or comment on this article e-mail 718 shares Most watched News videos Three dead after two bounty hunters shoot up Nissan dealership Beefeater tells woman off for throwing glove at Royal Guard Trump announces U.S. will officially withdraw from Paris accord Catching a Killer: Documentary shows search for mother's killer Reports indicate Trump pulling US out of Paris climate deal Road rage pair kung-fu fight in middle of traffic jam in Malaga Dani Mathers apologizes for body shaming naked 70-year-old woman Jeremy Corbyn refuses to say if immigration would fall with him as PM Election 2017: The highlights from the BBC leaders' debate Timeline: Events that led to Tiger Woods' arrest suspicion of DUI Zookeeper mauled by a tiger talks about protecting the species Terrifying footage shows panic and chaos as people flee Manila hotel 'I represent the people of Pittsburgh NOT Paris': Trump...

The US-based pharma group said its RANGE study of Cyramza (ramucirumab) in patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) - the most common form of bladder cancer - could support possible filings next year. The trial is the first to show improved PFS compared to chemotherapy in mUC patients who have previously been treated with a first-line platinum-based regimen said Lilly, but it thinks it will have to demonstrate a benefit on overall survival to be able to file for approval of Cyramza in this indication, setting back a possible approval into 2019. If all goes according to plan however, Cyramza - a VEGF receptor 2 inhibitor that works by blocking blood vessel growth in tumours - could join the increasing list of immuno-oncology drugs that are starting to transform the treatment of bladder cancer after decades of stagnation. To date Merck & Co's Keytruda (pembrolizumab) and Roche's Tecentriq (atezolizumab) have been approved for first- and second-line treatment of mUC, while three other PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors - Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo (nivolumab), Merck KGaA/Pfizer's Bavencio (avelumab), and AstraZeneca's Imfinzi (durvalumab) - are licensed as second-line therapies for this type of cancer. Roche had a setback after a confirmatory trial for Tecentriq in this indication failed, but overall the new agents have achieved compelling results in mUC. Adding to its potential RANGE included some patients who were previously treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, suggesting it could become a key part of the emerging medicine armamentarium in bladder cancer adding another line of attack along with immuno-oncology and chemotherapy agents. "While there have been several recent advancements to treat this type of cancer, most patients progress despite treatment with existing therapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors," said Lilly in a statement on the data. The new indication would be a big boost for Cyramza, which has been a big earner for Lilly since its launch in 2014 but saw sales in the US for indications such as lung cancer fall back as a result of a switch to immuno-oncology drugs last year and pricing pressures. It's still posting good growth overall however, bringing in $614m last year and up 60% thanks to big gains in Japan in the stomach cancer category. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments.

If I had been asked how far back that went, after some thought, I would have suggested sometime in the mid- to late-70s after Michael Killeen took over as chief executive of the IDA. There have been many announcements in the last few weeks involving pharmaceutical companies investing in new jobs here, including Merck’s MSD in Cork and Carlow. I was pleasantly surprised the other day to discover that Abbott Laboratories has been in Ireland since 1946. It now has six manufacturing sites in Ireland and four other offices located in various parts of Ireland. It is one of the largest healthcare companies in the world. It has been a major success story. So much for those folk who ridiculed Ireland’s efforts at attracting foreign direct investment by suggesting they came only for 10 years until as the critics would insist “they used up the grants and then vanished”. Abbott is not the only company which has been in Ireland contributing to the economy for decades rather than just years. Abbott was back in the news again the other day with the announcement that Abbott intends to invest around €10m in its Irish nutritional devices business in Sligo. All of this is good news for the economy, for its employees and, of course, for those companies which supply goods and services to the company. However, it’s not just the investment of cash that is important, although that always helps. It’s another vote of confidence in an Ireland outside of Dublin. As the IDA said: “Multinational companies contribute significantly to Ireland in terms of direct employment, capital spend, and developing Ireland’s skill base.” Of course, they also pay taxes. The strength of the contribution of these multinational companies was a key factor in our ability to withstand the worst effects of the recent recession when much of the Irish domestic economy was seriously hammered. Indeed, we should not underestimate that contribution of the multinationals, even if at times little incidentals like Apple’s €13bn in back-taxes EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has ruled it pay back to the Irish Government leads to serious debate. Multinational companies accounted for about the vast bulk of all corporation taxes collected by the Government. Economist John FitzGerald estimates the multinationals accounted for 16% of total employment over the years 2012 to 2015. While the tax take from such companies, particularly coupled with the tax take from its employees, makes for a considerable part of the cash that we require to fund the day to day running of the economy, its importance to the economy has in fact lessened. That is to be welcomed as ultimately we must be able to support ourselves. Yet, foreign direct investment is still mobile investment. Its objective is to find a location where it can consistently make money. It will not establish an operation in any country without considerable thought. Likewise, it will not leave a location on a whim, nor will it do it lightly. But it will pull out its investment if makes sense for it to do so. Abbott has been in Ireland for over 70 years and has expanded its operations. This proves that such companies can and will become part of the local economy and remain so for a very long time. However, it makes it even more important we establish our own sustainable industrial base in what is an ever and rapidly changing global economy. Ultimately, we should not be totally dependent on decision makers who have no vested interest in the sustainable success of the Irish economy.

The infective disease are more severe in nature and presenting huge burden as well as highly contributing to death globally. Every year, due to infectious disease millions of people die worldwide. The challenges include the re-emergence of old ones, emergence of new infectious diseases, antibiotic resistance, as well as transmission issues exacerbated by increasing population density. Anti Infectives are the agents which inferring with different mechanisms such as DNA synthesis, cell wall synthesis or by slowing the growth of infective agents. To prevent the rapidly spreading infectious disease, anti-infective vaccines are the most prevailing health measure taken by healthcare system. Due to rising resistance to antibiotics, majorly companies are focusing on developing vaccines for infectious disease. Hepatitis (Recombivax HB, Havrix, Engerix-B), influenza (Fluarix, Fluzone, FluMist), polio (IPOL), malaria (RTSS), tuberculosis (BCG) are the some examples of anti-infective vaccines available in market. The global market of Anti-Infective Vaccines is classified on the basis of product type, disease type, end user and geography. The product type segment is further segmented as attenuated or live Vaccines, Inactivated Vaccines, recombinant vector & DNA Vaccines, and Others (toxoid, subunit, conjugate vaccines). Live attenuated vaccines are formed by amending a disease-producing bacterium or virus in a laboratory. The consequential vaccine organism, holds capability to replicate and produce immunity. Inactivated vaccines are formed by mounting the virus or bacterium in cell culture media, then incapacitating it with chemical or heat. Inactivated vaccines cannot replicate and are not alive. The global anti-infective vaccines market, on the basis of disease type is segmented as, viral diseases, and bacterial disease. Viral disease segmented is further segmented as, polio vaccine, influenza vaccines, hepatitis vaccines, rabies vaccine, and others.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Market Research Report: New Tech Developments and advancements to watch out for 2024 Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Market Global Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Market: Trends The market for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is expected to grow globally under the influence of high prevalence of OCD and life style changes causing changes in thinking processes. According to International OCD Foundation, approximately 2-3 million adults are living with OCD in the United States. The International OCD Foundation also states that nearly 500,000 American children have OCD. A large number of cases of OCD go unreported as many people are not aware that there is any such specific disease. Also, many people hide their illness in order to avoid embarrassment. Global Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Market: Overview Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may be defined as an anxiety disorder that is characterized by unreasonable and uncontrollable thoughts and fears that lead an individual to perform repetitive behaviors. Obsessive-compulsive disorder compels a person to get stuck on a particular thought or fear. For example, a person afraid of contamination may wash his/her hands repetitively in an order to make sure his/her hands are clean. Likewise, a person may check a gas stove multiple times to be sure that it’s really turned off. Usually people affected with obsessive-compulsive disorder possess both obsessions as well as compulsions; however, in many cases individuals may have either obsessions or compulsions. Some common thoughts that usually pop up in mind of people with obsessive-compulsive disorder are fear of being contaminated by germs or dirt, excessive thinking about religious or moral ideas, superstitions, having things orderly or symmetrical, doubts that stove is turned off and thoughts of hurting oneself or others. These thoughts cause people with obsessive-compulsive disorder to perform actions like repeatedly checking of things such as locks and switches; repeatedly reciting certain words with intent to reduce anxiety, ordering or arranging things and accumulating wastes like newspaper, wine bottles or empty food containers. The exact causes of OCD are not known, however, some possible reasons may include differences in brain structure and genetic factors. The treatment involves psychotherapy as well as medication. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is a specific type of psychotherapy that has been useful in treating people with OCD. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) teaches a person multiple ways of thinking, reacting and handling a particular situation. Most commonly used medications for treating OCD include antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications. A child suffering from PANDAS (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections) is prescribed antibiotics for treating strep infections and SSRI medicines (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline and paroxetine). View Report- www.transparencymarketresearch.com/obsessive-compulsive-d… Global Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Market: Regional Outlook Geographically, the market for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has been segmented into North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and Rest of the World (RoW).

The research study covers the present scenario and growth prospects of the global HAP drugs market for 2017-2021. Technavio presents a detailed picture of the market by way of study, synthesis, and summation of data from multiple sources. HAP drugs belong to the wide spectrum of global infectious disease therapeutics market, which was valued at USD 150 billion in 2016.

Technavio analysts highlight the following three factors that are contributing to the growth of the global HAP drugs market: Unmet demand due to lack of available treatment for MDR microorganisms Lack of proper treatment options available for the treatment of HAP because of MDR microorganisms is a major challenge for the healthcare providers. MDR microorganisms are those microorganisms that have developed antimicrobial drugs resistance. The resistance among various microorganisms to various antimicrobial drugs has emerged as a serious threat to public health across the globe. Sapna Jha, a lead infectious and rare diseases research analyst at Technavio, says, “VAP patients have a very high chance of getting affected from MDR. There is a lack of proper treatment for these microorganisms; however, this can prove to be a big threat for the general population.” Growing cases of surgeries Nosocomial infections are one of the major challenges faced by the healthcare industry today. HAP is the second major type of nosocomial infections after urinary tract infections. The disease has the highest mortality rate of all other nosocomial infections and the rate ranges between 35% and 50%. “Organ transplant is done with the aim of restoring the functions of the body. Organ transplantation is many times the only treatment left at the end stage of organ failures such as heart or liver failure. The organ transplant process has rapidly increased during the last few years,” adds Sapna. The inadequate healthcare infrastructure in the developing countries Inadequate healthcare infrastructure and lack of proper hygiene are some of the major problems faced by the healthcare system of the developing countries. As a result, healthcare-associated infection is a point of concern for the developing countries. In most of the hospitals in the developing countries, infection control procedure and other hygienic necessities get influenced due to several factors such as poor infrastructure, lack of financial resources and overcrowded hospitals.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman SCRS Launches Diversity Awareness Program ELLICOTT CITY, Md., June 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — The Society for Clinical Research Sites (SCRS) has recently launched an innovative new program, „Site Awareness and Best Practices for Inclusion of Diverse Populations in Research.” The program is aimed at developing a better understanding of the knowledge, expertise, and best practices at clinical research sites to meet the needs of an increasingly diverse United States population and to provide knowledge and solutions to aide sites in more successfully including the diverse patients in clinical research. The project has been advocated for and is being sponsored by: Merck as the Premier Supporting Sponsor, Janssen, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) as Contributors, and Acurian at the Patron level. Additional collaboration is being provided by the FDA from both the Office of Women’s and Minority Health. This diversity awareness program was created to support efforts by research sites to meet the goals of the FDA’s Action Plan to Enhance the Collection and Availability of Demographic Subgroup Data. The FDA’s plan prioritizes improvements in the quality of demographic subgroup data collection, reporting and analysis, encourages greater participation of diverse patients, and supports the transparency of subgroup data. „We know that clinical trials often fail to recruit diverse patients in sufficient numbers for subgroup analysis,” said Christine Pierre, President of SCRS. „Our members include sites with innovative and successful diverse patient recruitment programs, and SCRS is in a unique position to gather and share the best practices from all sites.” To find out more about becoming a sponsor of this program, contact Diana Foster, Vice President of Strategy and Development of SCRS, at diana.foster@myscrs.org.

recently published a report on the  North America Hormone Replacement Therapy Market  which estimates the market to grow from USD 6.77 billion from 2016 to USD 9.55 billion with a high CAGR of 7.12%. In women, after menopause, there is a fall in hormone levels wBlood Pressure Mhich leads to uncomfortable conditions like hot flashes, vaginal dryness and sometimes osteoporosis and heart conditions and also reduces the risk of diabetes by 30% in younger women. HRT's main purpose is to replace hormones that your body can no longer produce which is one of the reasons why it is the most efficient treatment for menopause. Estrogen Therapy is mainly recommended to women who have had a hysterectomy and experiencing the menopause symptoms. This is mainly due to the fact that though Estrogen helps during pregnancy, it also controls how your body controls calcium and raises good cholesterol in the blood. Estrogen/Progesterone/Progestin Therapy is prescribed to women who still have their uterus owing to the fact that taking Estrogen without Progesterone raises the risk of cancer of the endometrium, the lining of the uterus.

billion with a high CAGR of 6.14%. There are many ways that normal cells in the lungs change into cancer. Research into how cancer develops has led to therapies that target cancer in some very specific ways. To understand targeted therapies, it helps to look at how cells work and how they can change into cancer. Until the mid-2000s, treatment options were mostly limited to surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. Now, people diagnosed with lung cancer often have newer, more personalized treatment options. The goal of targeted therapy is to accurately target your individual tumour, which hopefully leads to more effective treatments and less side effects. The purpose of this brochure is to help you understand targeted therapies and what they mean for you. Targeted therapies work in similar ways in all cancers but certain drugs are more effective in certain subtypes of lung cancer.

The company has grown from the entrepreneurial dream of founder and President, Allan Evora to a Southeast leader in control systems integration that's completed over 800 projects in industries as diverse as utility-scale solar farms, data centers, and biogas plants. Among its recent accomplishments, Affinity Energy won the 2017 Minority Business Crown of Enterprise award (http://www.affinityenergy.com/charlotte-crowns-enterprise-mbe-award/) and Grant Thornton 2016 North Carolina 100 (http://www.affinityenergy.com/control-system-integrator-affinity-energy-north-carolinas-top-100/). "Much has changed over 15 years, but one thing has not," said Evora. "We're still absolutely and unequivocally dedicated to our customers and their energy projects. We couldn't have reached this milestone without their continued support." Evora originally founded Affinity Energy in 2002 as a systems integration firm involved in the design and installation of electrical power management systems (EPMS) for a wide variety of industries. The company took advantage of the switch to digital during the transformation of how electrical swtichgear and power reliability equipment were monitored, controlled, and protected. Initially attracting companies such as Bank of America, CREE, and Merck, the company formed the basis of its expertise in power and energy. Since then, they've adjusted their focus to include mission critical facilities, but have maintained focus on power and energy systems. Many successes integrating systems at manufacturing plants and critical facilities resulted in the quick growth of the company's size and services.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Ligand Enters into Worldwide OmniAb® Platform License Agreement with Surface Oncology SAN DIEGO–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ: LGND) announces it has entered into a worldwide license agreement with Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Surface Oncology. Under the license, Surface will be able to use the OmniRat®, OmniMouse® and OmniFlic® platforms to discover fully human mono- and bispecific antibodies. Ligand is eligible to receive annual platform access payments, development and regulatory milestone payments, and tiered royalties for each product incorporating an OmniAb antibody. Surface will be responsible for all costs related to the programs. “This agreement allows Surface Oncology to join a growing roster of companies with access to OmniAb, our novel transgenic rodent technology that goes beyond a transgenic mouse technology, adding a transgenic rat and a separate transgenic rat with fixed light chain antibodies to enable bispecific antibody discovery,” said John Higgins, Chief Executive Officer of Ligand. “This is the second OmniAb partnership announced within a week, further demonstrating the significant partnership interest that exists for this important, novel technology.” About Surface Oncology Surface Oncology is an immuno-oncology company developing next-generation immunotherapies targeting the tumor microenvironment. Surface’s novel cancer immunotherapies are designed to treat tumors that are unresponsive to currently available therapies, and would be used in combination with currently available therapies to enhance the overall efficacy of the treatment. The Company has a pipeline of seven novel immunotherapies, including programs targeting CD47 and CD73, supported by a broad strategic collaboration with Novartis focused on up to four next-generation immunotherapies. Headquartered in Cambridge, Mass., Surface was founded by Atlas Venture and is also supported by leading biotechnology venture investors F-Prime Capital Partners, Lilly Ventures, New Enterprise Associates (NEA) and Amgen Ventures. For more information, please visit www.surfaceoncology.com. About OmniAb® OmniAb includes three transgenic animal platforms for producing mono- and bispecific human therapeutic antibodies. OmniRat® is the industry’s first human monoclonal antibody technology based on rats. It has a complete immune system with a diverse antibody repertoire and generates antibodies with human idiotypes as effectively as wild-type animals make rat antibodies. OmniMouse® is a transgenic mouse that complements OmniRat and expands epitope coverage. OmniFlic® is an engineered rat with a fixed light chain for development of bispecific, fully human antibodies. The three platforms use patented technology, have broad freedom to operate, and deliver fully human antibodies with high affinity, specificity, expression, solubility and stability. About Ligand Pharmaceuticals Ligand is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing or acquiring technologies that help pharmaceutical companies discover and develop medicines. Our business model creates value for stockholders by providing a diversified portfolio of biotech and pharmaceutical product revenue streams that are supported by an efficient and low corporate cost structure.

OmniAb® is a patent-protected transgenic animal platform used in the discovery of fully human mono-and bispecific therapeutic antibodies.

Ligand Enters into Worldwide OmniAb® Platform License Agreement with Surface Oncology June 01, 2017 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ: LGND) announces it has entered into a worldwide license agreement with Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Surface Oncology. Under the license, Surface will be able to use the OmniRat®, OmniMouse® and OmniFlic® platforms to discover fully human mono- and bispecific antibodies. Ligand is eligible to receive annual platform access payments, development and regulatory milestone payments, and tiered royalties for each product incorporating an OmniAb antibody. Surface will be responsible for all costs related to the programs. “This agreement allows Surface Oncology to join a growing roster of companies with access to OmniAb, our novel transgenic rodent technology that goes beyond a transgenic mouse technology, adding a transgenic rat and a separate transgenic rat with fixed light chain antibodies to enable bispecific antibody discovery,” said John Higgins, Chief Executive Officer of Ligand. “This is the second OmniAb partnership announced within a week, further demonstrating the significant partnership interest that exists for this important, novel technology.” About Surface Oncology Surface Oncology is an immuno-oncology company developing next-generation immunotherapies targeting the tumor microenvironment. Surface’s novel cancer immunotherapies are designed to treat tumors that are unresponsive to currently available therapies, and would be used in combination with currently available therapies to enhance the overall efficacy of the treatment. The Company has a pipeline of seven novel immunotherapies, including programs targeting CD47 and CD73, supported by a broad strategic collaboration with Novartis focused on up to four next-generation immunotherapies. Headquartered in Cambridge, Mass., Surface was founded by Atlas Venture and is also supported by leading biotechnology venture investors F-Prime Capital Partners, Lilly Ventures, New Enterprise Associates (NEA) and Amgen Ventures. For more information, please visit www.surfaceoncology.com. About OmniAb® OmniAb includes three transgenic animal platforms for producing mono- and bispecific human therapeutic antibodies. OmniRat® is the industry’s first human monoclonal antibody technology based on rats. It has a complete immune system with a diverse antibody repertoire and generates antibodies with human idiotypes as effectively as wild-type animals make rat antibodies. OmniMouse® is a transgenic mouse that complements OmniRat and expands epitope coverage. OmniFlic® is an engineered rat with a fixed light chain for development of bispecific, fully human antibodies. The three platforms use patented technology, have broad freedom to operate, and deliver fully human antibodies with high affinity, specificity, expression, solubility and stability. About Ligand Pharmaceuticals Ligand is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing or acquiring technologies that help pharmaceutical companies discover and develop medicines. Our business model creates value for stockholders by providing a diversified portfolio of biotech and pharmaceutical product revenue streams that are supported by an efficient and low corporate cost structure. Our goal is to offer investors an opportunity to participate in the promise of the biotech industry in a profitable, diversified and lower-risk business than a typical biotech company. Our business model is based on doing what we do best: drug discovery, early-stage drug development, product reformulation and partnering. We partner with other pharmaceutical companies to leverage what they do best (late-stage development, regulatory management and commercialization) to ultimately generate our revenue. Ligand’s Captisol® platform technology is a patent-protected, chemically modified cyclodextrin with a structure designed to optimize the solubility and stability of drugs. OmniAb® is a patent-protected transgenic animal platform used in the discovery of fully human mono-and bispecific therapeutic antibodies. Ligand has established multiple alliances, licenses and other business relationships with the world's leading pharmaceutical companies including Novartis, Amgen, Merck, Pfizer, Celgene, Gilead, Janssen, Baxter International and Eli Lilly.

the modern world are two of the major reasons that have led to increasing humanization of animals. The trend of pet adoption as companions has been rising all over the world, fueling the demand for veterinary products.

The global companion animal specialty drugs market is expected to witness a CAGR of 4.9% in terms of revenue between 2017 and 2027.       (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161020/430874LOGO ) FMI's report titled "Companion Animal Specialty Drugs Market: Global Industry Analysis and Opportunity Assessment 2017-2027" also projects that sales of animal specialty drugs will remain high in regions such as North America, Western Europe and Asia Pacific excluding Japan (APEJ) during the forecast period. In 2016, North America accounted for around 33% revenue share of the market mainly due to the adoption of innovative service delivery models by most retailers in the region. In addition, the companion animal specialty drugs market in North America will continue to be highly lucrative over 2027.

Among all the product types, demand for parasiticides will continue to gain the highest traction over the next couple of years.

Manufacturers are also laying greater emphases on product and process innovation in order to improve their product portfolio as well as to offer better drug options. The market is dominated by top four players, Elanco, Merial, Zoetis, Inc. and Bayer AG, which collectively account for nearly two-third of the market share in terms of revenue.

Key Highlights of the Report Include:   Rising cases of pet obesity fueling the demand for medicines. Pet obesity has become quite prevalent, owing to the rising tendency to overfeed pets. Extensive feeding can make a negative impact on the health of pets, therefore making them susceptible to more diseases. Of late, higher importance to animal health and welfare has been observed in developing countries. This, in turn, is positively influencing the demand for compounded medication. Also, the need for easy access to services and affordable veterinary drugs is a major factor that is increasing the popularity of compounded drugs across the globe. The arrival of new technologies, especially in biologics such as recombinant DNA vaccines for dogs are expected to eventually drive demand for specialties in veterinary medicines in 2017 and beyond. On the basis of distribution channels, veterinary clinics account for more than one-third of the market share. Around US$ 12,446.3 Mn worth companion animal specialty drugs are expected to be distributed through veterinary clinics in 2017.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 June 2017 by Persistence Market Research Global DPP IV Inhibitors Market Projected to be Resilient by 2021 DPP IV inhibitors are a class of hypoglycemic agents that block the enzyme named dipeptidyl peptidase IV. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzyme break down the proteins that are responsible for stimulating the insulin producing cells that slows down gastric secretion. Proteins can activate the release of insulin and can control the blood sugar level if DPP IV is inhibited in our body. Moreover, DPP IV inhibitors restrict the formation of glucagon, a hormone that increases blood glucose level and thereby control the glucose levels in the body. DPP IV inhibitors are widely utilized as a treatment for type 2 diabetes. Sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin and linagliptin are included in the drug class DPP IV. Nasopharyngitis, headache, nausea and hypersensitivity are some of the adverse effects due to the utilization of DPP IV.

Mr Murrin, who has been a leading voice in highlighting the measures the Irish Government needs to take to ensure agri jobs are protected post-Brexit, believes preserving the UK market is "deliverable". "I genuinely believe and want the UK to be as important to my company five and 10 years from now as it is today. I believe that is possible with very careful movements from the Government and all stakeholders. "I've no doubt some people will say I'm mad, but I think it is deliverable," he said. "We need to defend, protect and maintain the British market. We spent 50 years developing that market, moving it from the hacking and packing stage, and in the absence of positive policies coming forward that all stakeholders can engage in, protection and maintenance is really crucial and we also need to step up our diversification networks." Speaking at a major MSD Animal Health conference focused on Sustainable Irish Food production in 2025, Mr Murrin said he has explained to Government the actions, steps and policy variations required to achieve this goal. "The Government must take positive, industry-wide measures to make long-term, very low-cost and very appropriate condition finance available to the Irish food industry in all its guises so that we can scale up, invest in our own competitiveness and take whatever steps we need," he said. "It's not a pipe dream, it is deliverable, the money in sitting there." ‘The longer you keep it bottled up the worse it’s going to get’  Irish rugby star Jack McGrath said dealing with his brother’s suicide was incredibly tough. Sponsored by Mr Murrin also revealed that Dawn Farms, Europe's largest multi-species business-to-business cooked meat producer, cooked enough ham to cover the Aviva stadium 5,000 times last year. The company, with plants based in Naas, Co Kildare and Northampton, UK, also produced enough pepperoni and salami to "circle the world five times," Mr Murrin claimed. Meanwhile, at the same conference, MEP Mairead McGuinness said a recent dinner between British Prime Minister Theresa May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker intended to pave the way for formal Brexit talks went "worse than was reported". "I don't know what they had for dessert but I think there was salt on it," she said. "We're not really in a place where both sides are able to go into a room and come out with a deal. That's doesn't say we won't be there… but the politics are just not right at the moment I would have to say."

Infectious Diseases of the Developing World This announcement demonstrates the continued leadership and commitment of the Government of Japan, leading life sciences companies, international foundations and other partners to combat neglected diseases; with this replenishment, which marks a doubling of previous commitments, GHIT will accelerate and expand its development of new tools while ensuring they are accessible and delivered to the world's most vulnerable News provided by Global Health Innovative Technology Fund (GHIT Fund) 01 Jun, 2017, 04:00 ET Share this article TOKYO, June 1, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The Global Health Innovative Technology Fund (GHIT Fund), which has been dedicated to leveraging Japanese expertise and capacity for health innovations to save lives in the world's poorest countries, announced today that it has secured commitments of over US$200 million* to its replenishment for its next phase of work, allowing it to move the most advanced tools out of the lab, and into the hands of those who need them most. GHIT's funding partners, including the Government of Japan (GOJ), private companies, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Wellcome Trust have committed over US$200 million in a significant vote of confidence in the institution's work. The new commitment for GHIT's second phase is double the initial US$100 million investment GHIT received when it was created in 2013. The GOJ will contribute roughly half of the replenishment, with other partners splitting the remaining half. Leveraging Japan's historic leadership in global health and innovation, along with the unique technology and knowhow of its domestic and global partners, GHIT invests in R&D projects to develop new medicines, vaccines and diagnostics to address a range of infectious diseases, including HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). It is the first public-private partnership of its kind for global health research and development (R&D), involving government, private companies, and private foundations. "In just four years, the GHIT's unique public-private partnership model has dramatically increased the global health community's capacity to develop technologies that can effectively battle the infectious diseases that afflict roughly one-third of the world's population," said GHIT Fund CEO BT Slingsby. "This work is moving us closer to achieving universal health coverage and human security goals." GHIT has moved quickly to fill a gap in R&D of new tools for malaria, tuberculosis and NTDs. In just four years, GHIT has broadened its funding partnerships substantially from eight core members in 2013 to almost twice that number today. The fund has invested approximately $100 million in 61 global product development partnerships that leverage Japanese innovation and capacities in pharmaceuticals. Eight of GHIT's 23 novel screening programs have advanced into the next stage of development; 6 clinical trials are under way in the developing world; and 2 projects have achieved proofs-of-concept (Phase II trials). GHIT's portfolio is characterized by products that are not only novel, but transformative for global health. This includes the first-ever pediatric formulation of the gold-standard drug for schistosomiasis, a water-borne parasitic disease linked to numerous acute and chronic health conditions. Other innovations include malaria drugs and vaccines, a TB vaccine that prevents initial TB infection—not just the later stages of active disease—and a new treatment strategy for Chagas disease, a tropical parasitic disease that can lead to heart failure. "Japan has shown strong leadership in accelerating scientific advances that save lives and have the potential to help millions escape the cycle of poverty," said Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. "From investments in research and development for neglected tropical diseases, to support for the Global Fund's progress in combatting AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, and now through a continued commitment to GHIT, Japan continues to play a critical role in improving the lives of the world's poorest." "Fighting the world's most neglected diseases has long been a priority for Japan," said Minister Yasuhisa Shiozaki of Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. "We believe in universal health coverage where all have access to the medicines and treatment they need. Given our scientific and technological strength, it is Japan's responsibility to work with others to eliminate some of the world's most intractable diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis, Chagas disease, and schistosomiasis." As GHIT prepares to enter the second five-year phase of its work, it plans to broaden its role in advancing R&D product development to include additional partnerships that further facilitate access to and delivery of the tools that emerge from its pipeline. To reinforce the bonds between R&D, access and delivery, and strengthen health systems, GHIT will be strengthening its collaboration with global health entities, such as Japan's Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED), and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), as well as the Global Fund, Gavi, WHO, UNICEF, UNDP, and others. GHIT's prioritization of access and delivery in its investment decision-making, coupled with Japan's priority on universal health coverage, will continue to foster partnerships committed to meeting critical unmet needs in global health. "GHIT is a really important innovation in and of itself," said Mark Dybul, former Executive Director of the Global Fund. "It is a great example of a public-private partnership that was created to foster R&D in a way that advances the goals of achieving universal health coverage and human security, which are cornerstone policies of Japan's health and foreign policies." Because these products are extraordinarily expensive and high-risk to develop and low-middle income countries are unable to pay for them, there is little financial incentive for for-profit companies to invest limited R&D resources into malaria, tuberculosis, and NTDs. Yet the full engagement of the private sector is critical to developing these tools and bringing them to market. GHIT's model is a solution to the market failure and enables the private sector to contribute to global health financially and by bringing their pharmaceutical expertise and capabilities to the R&D table to create affordable and accessible new products. "Over 700 million people live in absolute poverty, and 14 percent of children worldwide are not getting basic vaccines," said Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. Affordability and access of vaccines are key to filling these gaps. "GHIT's investment in the development of needed vaccines—and to making affordability and access a priority throughout the R&D process—is critical." Throughout its first phase, GHIT has been instrumental in helping to speed the discovery and development of a significant number of innovative technologies in record time. "With this replenishment of GHIT, Japan is further cementing its legacy as a leader in global health innovation," said Professor Kiyoshi Kurokawa, Chair of the GHIT Fund Board of Directors. "The success of GHIT is catalyzing Japan's engagement with other new initiatives and transforming global health partnerships. This is good for Japan and for the world." * All amounts listed at the exchange rate of USD1 = JPY100. Quotes from GHIT Funding Partners Koichi Aiboshi, Director-General for Global Issues, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said: "Japan has a long history in global health. In 2000, we promoted the inclusion of infectious diseases to the G8 agenda, and during the most recent summit, the first G7 summit after the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), global health was highlighted. I am glad that the GHIT was introduced in the Summit outcome document as a well-coordinated Public-Private Partnership for R&D. Our investment in GHIT, as well as other partnerships, is a clear signal that Japan has a sustained commitment to global health." Naoko Yamamoto, Assistant Minister for Global Health, Minister's Secretariat, Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, said: "By leveraging GHIT's new platform, we have been able to demonstrate at home and abroad that Japanese pharmaceutical companies, research organizations, and universities possess technologies and capabilities which can not only contribute to the nation's health, but to global health as well. Based on these successful experiences, I am hoping that many companies and research organizations in Japan become motivated to help address the challenges of global health, and this will lead to further advancing Japan's global health R&D." Trevor Mundel, President, Global Health, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, said: "Japan is a leader in global health, and GHIT is a primary example of Japan's commitment to transforming the global health landscape with a partnership that brings together the unique resources of governments, pharmaceutical companies, and the philanthropic sector to develop products that can turn the tide against the greatest burdens of disease in low- and middle-income countries." Stephen Caddick, Director, Innovations Division, Wellcome Trust, said: "Japan has an outstanding science base and an exceptional culture of innovation, which, along with its excellent pharmaceutical industry, makes it ideal for the rapid advancement of new ways to diagnose and treat disease. We're proud to support GHIT and to work with the partners to develop drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics as quickly as possible and to put them in the hands of the billions of people around the world who need them most." Yoshihiko Hatanaka, Representative Director, President and CEO, Astellas Pharma Inc., said: "GHIT catalyzed a mindset shift for the Japanese pharmaceutical industry vis-à-vis solving global health issues. More specifically, it created a mechanism for Japanese pharmaceutical companies to take leadership roles in solving global health issues by combining their R&D expertise and capabilities in cooperation with those of governments, international organizations and nonprofits." Osamu Nagayama, Representative Director, Chairman and CEO, Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., said: "In order for the global society to develop further, the realization of global health becomes increasingly important. GHIT Fund is the world's first public-private partnership which involves governments, private companies and foundations. The fund specializes in product development aiming for global health and engages in the critical mission. Chugai will contribute to the benefit for the medical community and human health around the world with its proprietary antibody engineering technologies and its compound library which is useful for drug discovery." George Nakayama, Representative Director, Chairman and CEO, Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited, said: "GHIT helps build bridges between our business and corporate social responsibility. We have significant resources to bring to bear on global health, including technologies, insights and experiences gained through the process of product development. It means a great deal to our company if we can leverage our technologies for global health and help develop and deliver products to patients in need." Haruo Naito, Representative Corporate Officer and CEO, Eisai Co., Ltd., said: "Our mission as a pharmaceutical company is to create new medicines and to deliver those medicines to all the people who need them. In order to eliminate neglected tropical diseases, malaria, and tuberculosis, which are a source of suffering to the people in developing countries, it is essential to both accelerate the development of new medicines and to improve access through partnerships, and we applaud the GHIT Fund's new endeavors on this front. Eisai is proactively engaged in contributing to global health, which we consider to be a long-term investment in creating a healthy and prosperous middle-income class." Isao Teshirogi, President and CEO, Shionogi & Co., Ltd., said: "Japanese pharmaceutical companies have always played a major role as innovators and producers of lifesaving medicines, vaccines and diagnostics. We can play a stronger role in seriously expanding the supply and accessibility of these medicines and improve overall health in poor countries." Christophe Weber, Representative Director, President and CEO, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, said: "GHIT is an innovative model for creating medicines and vaccines against diseases for which there is a lack of R&D funding, and I think it has been very successful. Investing in it and contributing to its work makes sense for Takeda not only because of our global health interests, but also because of the strong capabilities in Japan that can help make GHIT successful." Magdy Martínez-Solimán, Assistant Secretary-General, Assistant Administrator and Director, Bureau for Policy and Programme Support, United Nations Development Programme, said: "UNDP is proud to partner with Japan and GHIT, including through its Access and Delivery Partnership, which helps low- and middle-income countries address critical bottlenecks within their health systems so that GHIT-funded innovations can reach more people, faster." Shigetaka Komori, Chairman and CEO, FUJIFILM Corporation, said: "Partnering with the GHIT Fund has great significance for the delivery of solutions in developing countries where many unsolved infectious diseases exist. By utilizing its accumulated technologies, Fujifilm will create innovation in fields such as in-vitro diagnosis and therapeutic medications, and contribute to enhancing the quality of healthcare in developing countries." Tatsuo Higuchi, President and Representative Director, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., said: "Our multi-decade commitment to develop new treatments for tuberculosis resulted in the creation of delamanid, one of the first new anti-multidrug resistant pulmonary tuberculosis agents in almost half a century. Our partnership with the GHIT Fund enables us to further contribute to new drug development for the health of people across the world." Hisashi Ietsugu, Chairman and CEO, Sysmex Corporation, said: "We look forward to cooperating with the GHIT Fund to strengthen R&D capability for diagnostics against infectious diseases prevalent in developing countries. Through collaboration with the GHIT Fund, we will accelerate the creation of diagnostic technologies with advanced medical value for people suffering from infectious diseases." Kihito Takahashi, Vice President and Senior Managing Director, Development and Medical Affairs Division, GlaxoSmithKline K.K., said: "As a science-led global healthcare company, we are committed to taking on some of the world's biggest healthcare challenges. GHIT Fund is contributing to accelerating the development of innovative medicines and vaccines to save the patients who are suffering from neglected diseases in developing countries. We are proud of being a member of GHIT Fund and of supporting the same mission to overcome global healthcare challenges by harnessing the partnership." Paul Stoffels, Chief Scientific Officer, Johnson & Johnson, said: "We, at Johnson & Johnson, know that good health drives human progress. However there remain critical public health challenges such as HIV and tuberculosis, which limit people's potential and could be addressed through innovation and collaboration. We are therefore proud to continue supporting GHIT's work to help develop innovative health solutions for people facing significant public health challenges." Nobuo Hanai, President and CEO, Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd., said: "We share GHIT's sense of urgency about the need to deliver new tools to those suffering from diseases with no adequate treatments. Partnering with GHIT, which focuses on global partnerships, will advance the "CSV* management" based on Our Unique Business Structure." (CSV stands for "Creating Shared Value" and refers to realizing improved corporate value through both the creation of social value and the creation of economic value by addressing social issues.) Belén Garijo, Member of the Executive Board & CEO Healthcare, Merck KGaA, said: "We at Merck are strongly committed to the fight against schistosomiasis in Africa and just celebrated 10 years of our Praziquantel Donation Program. Our leadership on the Pediatric Praziquantel Consortium, which is partially partnered by GHIT, makes me confident that this engagement with GHIT is bringing us ever closer to a potential treatment solution for the most vulnerable patients—very young children." Masayuki Mitsuka, President & Representative Director, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation, said: "We are honored to make our chemical compound library available to global health R&D through GHIT. Our ongoing partnership between PDPs and GHIT will move the dial on battling drug-resistance and creating new treatments for the infectious diseases that burden the developing world." Masayo Tada, Representative Director, President and CEO, Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd., said: "We are dedicated to creating innovative and effective pharmaceutical products for people not only in Japan but also around the world. Through our participation in GHIT Fund, we are seeking to explore how we can utilize our innovative drug discovery technologies for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), malaria, and other disease fields in which there are significant unmet medical needs, thereby aiming to enhance Access to Health."

This includes the first-ever pediatric formulation of the gold-standard drug for schistosomiasis, a water-borne parasitic disease linked to numerous acute and chronic health conditions. Other innovations include malaria drugs and vaccines, a TB vaccine that prevents initial TB infection—not just the later stages of active disease—and a new treatment strategy for Chagas disease, a tropical parasitic disease that can lead to heart failure. „Japan has shown strong leadership in accelerating scientific advances that save lives and have the potential to help millions escape the cycle of poverty,” said Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. „From investments in research and development for neglected tropical diseases, to support for the Global Fund’s progress in combatting AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, and now through a continued commitment to GHIT, Japan continues to play a critical role in improving the lives of the world’s poorest.” „Fighting the world’s most neglected diseases has long been a priority for Japan,” said Minister Yasuhisa Shiozaki of Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. „We believe in universal health coverage where all have access to the medicines and treatment they need. Given our scientific and technological strength, it is Japan’s responsibility to work with others to eliminate some of the world’s most intractable diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis, Chagas disease, and schistosomiasis.” As GHIT prepares to enter the second five-year phase of its work, it plans to broaden its role in advancing R&D product development to include additional partnerships that further facilitate access to and delivery of the tools that emerge from its pipeline. To reinforce the bonds between R&D, access and delivery, and strengthen health systems, GHIT will be strengthening its collaboration with global health entities, such as Japan’s Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED), and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), as well as the Global Fund, Gavi, WHO, UNICEF, UNDP, and others. GHIT’s prioritization of access and delivery in its investment decision-making, coupled with Japan’s priority on universal health coverage, will continue to foster partnerships committed to meeting critical unmet needs in global health. „GHIT is a really important innovation in and of itself,” said Mark Dybul, former Executive Director of the Global Fund. „It is a great example of a public-private partnership that was created to foster R&D in a way that advances the goals of achieving universal health coverage and human security, which are cornerstone policies of Japan’s health and foreign policies.” Because these products are extraordinarily expensive and high-risk to develop and low-middle income countries are unable to pay for them, there is little financial incentive for for-profit companies to invest limited R&D resources into malaria, tuberculosis, and NTDs. Yet the full engagement of the private sector is critical to developing these tools and bringing them to market. GHIT’s model is a solution to the market failure and enables the private sector to contribute to global health financially and by bringing their pharmaceutical expertise and capabilities to the R&D table to create affordable and accessible new products. „Over 700 million people live in absolute poverty, and 14 percent of children worldwide are not getting basic vaccines,” said Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. Affordability and access of vaccines are key to filling these gaps. „GHIT’s investment in the development of needed vaccines—and to making affordability and access a priority throughout the R&D process—is critical.” Throughout its first phase, GHIT has been instrumental in helping to speed the discovery and development of a significant number of innovative technologies in record time. „With this replenishment of GHIT, Japan is further cementing its legacy as a leader in global health innovation,” said Professor Kiyoshi Kurokawa, Chair of the GHIT Fund Board of Directors. „The success of GHIT is catalyzing Japan’s engagement with other new initiatives and transforming global health partnerships. This is good for Japan and for the world.” * All amounts listed at the exchange rate of USD1 = JPY100. Quotes from GHIT Funding Partners Koichi Aiboshi, Director-General for Global Issues, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said: „Japan has a long history in global health. In 2000, we promoted the inclusion of infectious diseases to the G8 agenda, and during the most recent summit, the first G7 summit after the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), global health was highlighted. I am glad that the GHIT was introduced in the Summit outcome document as a well-coordinated Public-Private Partnership for R&D. Our investment in GHIT, as well as other partnerships, is a clear signal that Japan has a sustained commitment to global health.” Naoko Yamamoto, Assistant Minister for Global Health, Minister’s Secretariat, Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, said: „By leveraging GHIT’s new platform, we have been able to demonstrate at home and abroad that Japanese pharmaceutical companies, research organizations, and universities possess technologies and capabilities which can not only contribute to the nation’s health, but to global health as well. Based on these successful experiences, I am hoping that many companies and research organizations in Japan become motivated to help address the challenges of global health, and this will lead to further advancing Japan’s global health R&D.” Trevor Mundel, President, Global Health, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, said: „Japan is a leader in global health, and GHIT is a primary example of Japan’s commitment to transforming the global health landscape with a partnership that brings together the unique resources of governments, pharmaceutical companies, and the philanthropic sector to develop products that can turn the tide against the greatest burdens of disease in low- and middle-income countries.” Stephen Caddick, Director, Innovations Division, Wellcome Trust, said: „Japan has an outstanding science base and an exceptional culture of innovation, which, along with its excellent pharmaceutical industry, makes it ideal for the rapid advancement of new ways to diagnose and treat disease. We’re proud to support GHIT and to work with the partners to develop drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics as quickly as possible and to put them in the hands of the billions of people around the world who need them most.” Yoshihiko Hatanaka, Representative Director, President and CEO, Astellas Pharma Inc., said: „GHIT catalyzed a mindset shift for the Japanese pharmaceutical industry vis-à-vis solving global health issues. More specifically, it created a mechanism for Japanese pharmaceutical companies to take leadership roles in solving global health issues by combining their R&D expertise and capabilities in cooperation with those of governments, international organizations and nonprofits.” Osamu Nagayama, Representative Director, Chairman and CEO, Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., said: „In order for the global society to develop further, the realization of global health becomes increasingly important. GHIT Fund is the world’s first public-private partnership which involves governments, private companies and foundations. The fund specializes in product development aiming for global health and engages in the critical mission. Chugai will contribute to the benefit for the medical community and human health around the world with its proprietary antibody engineering technologies and its compound library which is useful for drug discovery.” George Nakayama, Representative Director, Chairman and CEO, Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited, said: „GHIT helps build bridges between our business and corporate social responsibility. We have significant resources to bring to bear on global health, including technologies, insights and experiences gained through the process of product development. It means a great deal to our company if we can leverage our technologies for global health and help develop and deliver products to patients in need.” Haruo Naito, Representative Corporate Officer and CEO, Eisai Co., Ltd., said: „Our mission as a pharmaceutical company is to create new medicines and to deliver those medicines to all the people who need them. In order to eliminate neglected tropical diseases, malaria, and tuberculosis, which are a source of suffering to the people in developing countries, it is essential to both accelerate the development of new medicines and to improve access through partnerships, and we applaud the GHIT Fund’s new endeavors on this front. Eisai is proactively engaged in contributing to global health, which we consider to be a long-term investment in creating a healthy and prosperous middle-income class.” Isao Teshirogi, President and CEO, Shionogi & Co., Ltd., said: „Japanese pharmaceutical companies have always played a major role as innovators and producers of lifesaving medicines, vaccines and diagnostics. We can play a stronger role in seriously expanding the supply and accessibility of these medicines and improve overall health in poor countries.” Christophe Weber, Representative Director, President and CEO, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, said: „GHIT is an innovative model for creating medicines and vaccines against diseases for which there is a lack of R&D funding, and I think it has been very successful. Investing in it and contributing to its work makes sense for Takeda not only because of our global health interests, but also because of the strong capabilities in Japan that can help make GHIT successful.” Magdy Martínez-Solimán, Assistant Secretary-General, Assistant Administrator and Director, Bureau for Policy and Programme Support, United Nations Development Programme, said: „UNDP is proud to partner with Japan and GHIT, including through its Access and Delivery Partnership, which helps low- and middle-income countries address critical bottlenecks within their health systems so that GHIT-funded innovations can reach more people, faster.” Shigetaka Komori, Chairman and CEO, FUJIFILM Corporation, said: „Partnering with the GHIT Fund has great significance for the delivery of solutions in developing countries where many unsolved infectious diseases exist. By utilizing its accumulated technologies, Fujifilm will create innovation in fields such as in-vitro diagnosis and therapeutic medications, and contribute to enhancing the quality of healthcare in developing countries.” Tatsuo Higuchi, President and Representative Director, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., said: „Our multi-decade commitment to develop new treatments for tuberculosis resulted in the creation of delamanid, one of the first new anti-multidrug resistant pulmonary tuberculosis agents in almost half a century. Our partnership with the GHIT Fund enables us to further contribute to new drug development for the health of people across the world.” Hisashi Ietsugu, Chairman and CEO, Sysmex Corporation, said: „We look forward to cooperating with the GHIT Fund to strengthen R&D capability for diagnostics against infectious diseases prevalent in developing countries.

GHIT Fund is contributing to accelerating the development of innovative medicines and vaccines to save the patients who are suffering from neglected diseases in developing countries. We are proud of being a member of GHIT Fund and of supporting the same mission to overcome global healthcare challenges by harnessing the partnership.” Paul Stoffels, Chief Scientific Officer, Johnson & Johnson, said: „We, at Johnson & Johnson, know that good health drives human progress. However there remain critical public health challenges such as HIV and tuberculosis, which limit people’s potential and could be addressed through innovation and collaboration. We are therefore proud to continue supporting GHIT’s work to help develop innovative health solutions for people facing significant public health challenges.” Nobuo Hanai, President and CEO, Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd., said: „We share GHIT’s sense of urgency about the need to deliver new tools to those suffering from diseases with no adequate treatments. Partnering with GHIT, which focuses on global partnerships, will advance the „CSV* management” based on Our Unique Business Structure.” (CSV stands for „Creating Shared Value” and refers to realizing improved corporate value through both the creation of social value and the creation of economic value by addressing social issues.) Belén Garijo, Member of the Executive Board & CEO Healthcare, Merck KGaA, said: „We at Merck are strongly committed to the fight against schistosomiasis in Africa and just celebrated 10 years of our Praziquantel Donation Program. Our leadership on the Pediatric Praziquantel Consortium, which is partially partnered by GHIT, makes me confident that this engagement with GHIT is bringing us ever closer to a potential treatment solution for the most vulnerable patients—very young children.” Masayuki Mitsuka, President & Representative Director, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation, said: „We are honored to make our chemical compound library available to global health R&D through GHIT.

GHIT's funding partners, including the Government of Japan (GOJ), private companies, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Wellcome Trust have committed over US$200 million in a significant vote of confidence in the institution's work. The new commitment for GHIT's second phase is double the initial US$100 million investment GHIT received when it was created in 2013. The GOJ will contribute roughly half of the replenishment, with other partners splitting the remaining half. Leveraging Japan's historic leadership in global health and innovation, along with the unique technology and knowhow of its domestic and global partners, GHIT invests in R&D projects to develop new medicines, vaccines and diagnostics to address a range of infectious diseases, including HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). It is the first public-private partnership of its kind for global health research and development (R&D), involving government, private companies, and private foundations. "In just four years, the GHIT's unique public-private partnership model has dramatically increased the global health community's capacity to develop technologies that can effectively battle the infectious diseases that afflict roughly one-third of the world's population," said GHIT Fund CEO BT Slingsby. "This work is moving us closer to achieving universal health coverage and human security goals." GHIT has moved quickly to fill a gap in R&D of new tools for malaria, tuberculosis and NTDs. In just four years, GHIT has broadened its funding partnerships substantially from eight core members in 2013 to almost twice that number today. The fund has invested approximately $100 million in 61 global product development partnerships that leverage Japanese innovation and capacities in pharmaceuticals. Eight of GHIT's 23 novel screening programs have advanced into the next stage of development; 6 clinical trials are under way in the developing world; and 2 projects have achieved proofs-of-concept (Phase II trials). GHIT's portfolio is characterized by products that are not only novel, but transformative for global health. This includes the first-ever pediatric formulation of the gold-standard drug for schistosomiasis, a water-borne parasitic disease linked to numerous acute and chronic health conditions. Other innovations include malaria drugs and vaccines, a TB vaccine that prevents initial TB infection—not just the later stages of active disease—and a new treatment strategy for Chagas disease, a tropical parasitic disease that can lead to heart failure. "Japan has shown strong leadership in accelerating scientific advances that save lives and have the potential to help millions escape the cycle of poverty," said Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. "From investments in research and development for neglected tropical diseases, to support for the Global Fund's progress in combatting AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, and now through a continued commitment to GHIT, Japan continues to play a critical role in improving the lives of the world's poorest." "Fighting the world's most neglected diseases has long been a priority for Japan," said Minister Yasuhisa Shiozaki of Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. "We believe in universal health coverage where all have access to the medicines and treatment they need. Given our scientific and technological strength, it is Japan's responsibility to work with others to eliminate some of the world's most intractable diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis, Chagas disease, and schistosomiasis." As GHIT prepares to enter the second five-year phase of its work, it plans to broaden its role in advancing R&D product development to include additional partnerships that further facilitate access to and delivery of the tools that emerge from its pipeline. To reinforce the bonds between R&D, access and delivery, and strengthen health systems, GHIT will be strengthening its collaboration with global health entities, such as Japan's Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED), and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), as well as the Global Fund, Gavi, WHO, UNICEF, UNDP, and others.

More specifically, it created a mechanism for Japanese pharmaceutical companies to take leadership roles in solving global health issues by combining their R&D expertise and capabilities in cooperation with those of governments, international organizations and nonprofits." Osamu Nagayama, Representative Director, Chairman and CEO, Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., said: "In order for the global society to develop further, the realization of global health becomes increasingly important. GHIT Fund is the world's first public-private partnership which involves governments, private companies and foundations. The fund specializes in product development aiming for global health and engages in the critical mission. Chugai will contribute to the benefit for the medical community and human health around the world with its proprietary antibody engineering technologies and its compound library which is useful for drug discovery." George Nakayama, Representative Director, Chairman and CEO, Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited, said: "GHIT helps build bridges between our business and corporate social responsibility. We have significant resources to bring to bear on global health, including technologies, insights and experiences gained through the process of product development. It means a great deal to our company if we can leverage our technologies for global health and help develop and deliver products to patients in need." Haruo Naito, Representative Corporate Officer and CEO, Eisai Co., Ltd., said: "Our mission as a pharmaceutical company is to create new medicines and to deliver those medicines to all the people who need them. In order to eliminate neglected tropical diseases, malaria, and tuberculosis, which are a source of suffering to the people in developing countries, it is essential to both accelerate the development of new medicines and to improve access through partnerships, and we applaud the GHIT Fund's new endeavors on this front. Eisai is proactively engaged in contributing to global health, which we consider to be a long-term investment in creating a healthy and prosperous middle-income class." Isao Teshirogi, President and CEO, Shionogi & Co., Ltd., said: "Japanese pharmaceutical companies have always played a major role as innovators and producers of lifesaving medicines, vaccines and diagnostics. We can play a stronger role in seriously expanding the supply and accessibility of these medicines and improve overall health in poor countries." Christophe Weber, Representative Director, President and CEO, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, said: "GHIT is an innovative model for creating medicines and vaccines against diseases for which there is a lack of R&D funding, and I think it has been very successful. Investing in it and contributing to its work makes sense for Takeda not only because of our global health interests, but also because of the strong capabilities in Japan that can help make GHIT successful." Magdy Martínez-Solimàn, Assistant Secretary-General, Assistant Administrator and Director, Bureau for Policy and Programme Support, United Nations Development Programme, said: "UNDP is proud to partner with Japan and GHIT, including through its Access and Delivery Partnership, which helps low- and middle-income countries address critical bottlenecks within their health systems so that GHIT-funded innovations can reach more people, faster." Shigetaka Komori, Chairman and CEO, FUJIFILM Corporation, said: "Partnering with the GHIT Fund has great significance for the delivery of solutions in developing countries where many unsolved infectious diseases exist. By utilizing its accumulated technologies, Fujifilm will create innovation in fields such as in-vitro diagnosis and therapeutic medications, and contribute to enhancing the quality of healthcare in developing countries." Tatsuo Higuchi, President and Representative Director, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., said: "Our multi-decade commitment to develop new treatments for tuberculosis resulted in the creation of delamanid, one of the first new anti-multidrug resistant pulmonary tuberculosis agents in almost half a century. Our partnership with the GHIT Fund enables us to further contribute to new drug development for the health of people across the world." Hisashi Ietsugu, Chairman and CEO, Sysmex Corporation, said: "We look forward to cooperating with the GHIT Fund to strengthen R&D capability for diagnostics against infectious diseases prevalent in developing countries. Through collaboration with the GHIT Fund, we will accelerate the creation of diagnostic technologies with advanced medical value for people suffering from infectious diseases." Kihito Takahashi, Vice President and Senior Managing Director, Development and Medical Affairs Division, GlaxoSmithKline K.K., said: "As a science-led global healthcare company, we are committed to taking on some of the world's biggest healthcare challenges. GHIT Fund is contributing to accelerating the development of innovative medicines and vaccines to save the patients who are suffering from neglected diseases in developing countries. We are proud of being a member of GHIT Fund and of supporting the same mission to overcome global healthcare challenges by harnessing the partnership." Paul Stoffels, Chief Scientific Officer, Johnson & Johnson, said: "We, at Johnson & Johnson, know that good health drives human progress. However there remain critical public health challenges such as HIV and tuberculosis, which limit people's potential and could be addressed through innovation and collaboration. We are therefore proud to continue supporting GHIT's work to help develop innovative health solutions for people facing significant public health challenges." Nobuo Hanai, President and CEO, Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd., said: "We share GHIT's sense of urgency about the need to deliver new tools to those suffering from diseases with no adequate treatments. Partnering with GHIT, which focuses on global partnerships, will advance the "CSV* management" based on Our Unique Business Structure." (CSV stands for "Creating Shared Value" and refers to realizing improved corporate value through both the creation of social value and the creation of economic value by addressing social issues.) Belén Garijo, Member of the Executive Board & CEO Healthcare, Merck KGaA, said: "We at Merck are strongly committed to the fight against schistosomiasis in Africa and just celebrated 10 years of our Praziquantel Donation Program. Our leadership on the Pediatric Praziquantel Consortium, which is partially partnered by GHIT, makes me confident that this engagement with GHIT is bringing us ever closer to a potential treatment solution for the most vulnerable patients—very young children." Masayuki Mitsuka, President & Representative Director, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation, said: "We are honored to make our chemical compound library available to global health R&D through GHIT. Our ongoing partnership between PDPs and GHIT will move the dial on battling drug-resistance and creating new treatments for the infectious diseases that burden the developing world." Masayo Tada, Representative Director, President and CEO, Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd., said: "We are dedicated to creating innovative and effective pharmaceutical products for people not only in Japan but also around the world. Through our participation in GHIT Fund, we are seeking to explore how we can utilize our innovative drug discovery technologies for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), malaria, and other disease fields in which there are significant unmet medical needs, thereby aiming to enhance Access to Health."
