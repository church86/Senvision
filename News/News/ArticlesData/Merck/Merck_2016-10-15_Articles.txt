Approval for Dynavax's hepatitis B vaccine could be in jeopardy. Does the biotech have a backup plan ready? Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) Oct 16, 2016 at 11:43AM Image source: Getty Images. Here's how small-cap biotech Dynavax Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:DVAX) would like its story to play out: Hepatitis B vaccine Heplisav-B wins FDA approval in December. The company begins marketing the vaccine in 2017. Heplisav-B then goes on to quickly exceed sales projections. Dynavax's stock soars. That's plan A. But does Dynavax need a plan B? And if so, what is it? Is Heplisav-B in trouble? The Food and Drug Administration was originally scheduled to make a decision on Heplisav-B by Sept. 15. In April, however, that date was pushed back to Dec. 15. The FDA said it needed more time to complete its review of the Biologics License Application (BLA) for the vaccine. An FDA advisory committee was scheduled to review the BLA for Heplisav-B on Nov. 16. But that meeting won't happen. The FDA notified Dynavax in September that the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee meeting was canceled. Instead, the agency said that any "remaining questions will be addressed between Dynavax and the review team." These types of advisory meeting cancellations usually aren't a good sign. Dynavax shares have dropped 24% since the news broke. The market certainly appears to think that Heplisav-B could be in trouble. That might not be the case, of course. But if Heplisav-B fails to win approval, what's next for Dynavax? Plan B It was only three years ago that Dynavax thought it was on track for imminent success with Heplisav-B. The company had the rug pulled out from under its feet, though, when the FDA rejected the vaccine over safety concerns. Dynavax's plan B back then was to regroup and conduct more clinical studies of Heplisav-B. I imagine the company will take the same approach if the FDA doesn't approve the vaccine later this year. Of course, this all depends on the details behind any potential negative decision. Another backup strategy would be for Dynavax to shift its focus to cancer drug SD-101. Merck (NYSE:MRK) liked the potential for SD-101 enough that it forged an agreement with Dynavax in 2015 to collaborate on clinical studies.  Early results from one of those studies were announced on Oct. 9. Patients with advanced melanoma were given SD-101 in combination with Merck's Keytruda. While the initial results were encouraging, only five patients were evaluated for efficacy of the regimen, with 16 patients evaluated for safety. Merck also plans to test SD-101 with its anti-interleukin-10 cancer drug, MK-1966. Enrollment is under way for a phase 1 clinical study. At this point, though, any potential for MK-1966 combined with SD-101 is so far out that Merck doesn't even include the study in its "official" pipeline.  Dynavax's pipeline does include a couple of candidates other than Heplisav-B and SD-101. The biotech partnered with AstraZeneca to develop experimental asthma drug AZD1419. There's also DV1179, a toll-like receptor (TLR) inhibitor that targets autoimmune diseases. Both drugs are in early-stage clinical studies. Planning ahead I suspect that Dynavax's management team is bracing themselves in case they have to resort to a plan B. At least they had practice with the setback for Heplisav-B a few years ago. What could investors who have already bought Dynavax stock do in the midst of all the uncertainty? Shareholders could simply hold on and hope for the best. Another alternative is to hedge by buying put options (although the volatility makes options expensive). And, of course, there's always the choice of selling now.  The good news is that Dynavax -- and its shareholders -- have a plan B to fall back on. The bad news is that plan B is almost always worse than plan A. Keith Speights has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

CLOSE Saudi Arabia World Opinion Business Technology Sport Rio Olympics 2016 Life Art & Culture Drive Explore Faith Fashion Monday, November 14, 2016 SG ePaper Saudi Arabia World Opinion Business Technology Sport Rio Olympics 2016 Life Sting reopens Paris Bataclan amid tears, cheers and controversy Italian, US artists to create works for Louvre Abu Dhabi Egyptian actor Mahmoud Abdel Aziz dies aged 70 Hollywood worries about Trump as stars honor Jackie Chan Zuckerberg among Facebook users mistakenly declared ‘dead’ AllArt & CultureDriveExploreFaithFashion Home Business MSD makes headway in treating lung cancer that impacts economy Business MSD makes headway in treating lung cancer that impacts economy Oct 16, 2016 662 0 SHARE Facebook Twitter A doctor from MSD explains the new drug and its wonders in treating cancer during an international forum in Copenhagen, Denmark RIYADH — The cost of lost productivity and toll in the economic growth as a whole, of premature cancer-related mortality will be greatly minimized, with MSD – the global healthcare leader providing innovative medicines, vaccines, therapies, health products and solutions – revealing a new clinical data showing its Keytruda immunotherapy offered big benefits in previously untreated lung cancer patients, either when given on its own or with chemotherapy. Most measures of the cancer burden take a public health perspective. Cancer also has a significant economic impact on society. At an international event held in Copenhagen, experts from MSD, known as Merck in the US and Canada, disclosed that Keytruda halved the risk of disease progression and cut overall deaths by 40 percent compared to chemotherapy alone in pre-selected patients whose tumors had been tested using a biomarker. And when given with two older chemotherapy drugs in non-selected patients, it was almost twice as likely to shrink tumors as chemotherapy alone. “Chemotherapy has been the standard treatment for most patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer for decades, but survival rates remain low,” said Dr. Roger M. Perlmutter, president, Merck Research Laboratories. “Our new data suggest that Keytruda treatment can offer meaningful improvement over chemotherapy in a broad array of patients. In this sense, these studies may represent a turning point in worldwide efforts to control lung cancer. We sincerely thank the patients and the clinical investigators for their participation in our studies. Together we are working to improve the health of more and more patients with cancer.” The findings published in The New England Journal of Medicine demonstrated that Keytruda reduced the risk of progression or death by 50 percent compared to chemotherapy Additionally, Keytruda resulted in a 40 percent reduction in the risk of death compared with chemotherapy. This finding includes the 66 patients (43.7%) on the chemotherapy arm who crossed over in-study to receive Keytruda once their cancer had progressed. “These data … demonstrate the potential of Keytruda to change the way non-small cell lung cancer is currently treated,” said Dr. Martin Reck, head of the thoracic oncology dept., LungenClinic Grosshansdorf, Germany, and lead author of The New England Journal of Medicine paper. The safety of Keytruda was consistent with what has been seen in previous trials among patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The most common treatment-related adverse events for Keytruda were diarrhea, fatigue, and pyrexia. Moreover, Roger Dansey, M.D., senior vice president and therapeutic area head, oncology late-stage development, Merck Research Laboratories, said “our research in immuno-oncology continues to show tremendous promise, with our goal being to extend the lives of significant numbers of patients with non-small cell lung cancer.” Merck has a robust clinical development program for Keytruda in lung cancer, with multiple registration-enabling studies currently underway. The Keytruda clinical development program includes more than 30 tumor types in more than 350 clinical trials, including more than 100 trials that combine Keytruda with other cancer treatments. MSD’s goal is to translate breakthrough science into innovative oncology medicines to help people with cancer worldwide. At MSD Oncology, “helping people fight cancer is our passion and supporting accessibility to our cancer medicines is our commitment. Our focus is on pursuing research in immuno-oncology and we are accelerating every step in the journey – from lab to clinic – to potentially bring new hope to people with cancer.” “As part of our focus on cancer, MSD is committed to exploring the potential of immuno-oncology with one of the fastest-growing development programs in the industry. We are currently executing an expansive research program that includes more than 350 clinical trials evaluating our anti-PD-1 therapy across more than 30 tumor types. We also continue to strengthen our immuno-oncology portfolio through strategic acquisitions and are prioritizing the development of several promising immunotherapeutic candidates with the potential to improve the treatment of advanced cancers,” MSD said in a statement.

Meet the Contributors → Bio Roundup: Bristol & Illumina Blues, Sickle Cell News & More Ben Fidler October 14th, 2016 @benthefidler @xconomy Like Us Xconomy National —  On Aug. 4, shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb closed at $75.32. Today, shares are worth just over $50. That means in three months, Bristol has lost a third of its value, equivalent to about $40 billion in market capitalization. The reason? One failed clinical trial has left rival Merck in the lead position to have what could be part of the new standard of care for lung cancer. That story and plenty more in this week’s roundup. TOP STORIES —The European Society of Medical Oncology held its annual meeting in Copenhagen, and the meeting featured updates on heavyweight immunotherapy programs, potential options for patients with advanced breast cancer, and more. Some of the big headlines from the meeting included the latest data on a prospective ovarian cancer drug, niraparib, from Waltham, MA-based Tesaro (NASDAQ: TSRO), and results from Merck’s (NYSE: MRK) pembrolizumab (Keytruda) in newly diagnosed lung cancer patients. Merck’s data sent immunotherapy rival Bristol’s shares down more than 10 percent, while Tesaro’s shares gained 17 percent over the week. —Shares of San Diego-based Illumina (NASDAQ: ILMN) fell more than 32 percent after the next-gen sequencing giant slashed its revenue projections once again. Illumina fended off a hostile takeover bid from Roche back in February 2012, and over the next three years shares went from about $51 apiece to as high as $219.30 in July 2015. But sagging sales have sent Illumina far down from last year’s peak. Here’s more from CNBC. THIS WEEK IN SICKLE CELL… —Researchers at UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital Oakland, the Innovative Genomics Initiative of Berkeley, CA, and the University of Utah have made progress on a gene-editing treatment for sickle cell disease. The work used CRISPR-Cas9 to fix a genetic mutation in human bone marrow cells that were transplanted into mice. It remains years away from human testing. —Cambridge, MA-based Bluebird Bio (NASDAQ: BLUE) has made technological improvements to the process it uses to manufacture gene therapies. They’ll be incorporated into Bluebird’s current and future trials, which Bluebird hopes might help it overcome some of the limitations it’s seen so far in gene therapies for sickle cell and beta-thalassemia. IPOS, BIG AND SMALL —Cambridge and Basel-based CRISPR Therapeutics, which could go public next week, aims to raise $75 million by selling 4.7 million shares at $15 to $17 apiece. —Cancer drug developer Accelerated Pharma, based in Westport, CT, outlined terms for a $17 million IPO. —AzurRx Biopharma (NASDAQ: AZRX), which has an executive office at SUNY Downstate’s biotech incubator in Brooklyn, raised $5.3 million in an IPO. FUNDING ROUNDS —Zymergen of Emeryville, CA, raised a $130 million Series B round for its biological manufacturing business. It engineers microbes to produce chemicals for a range of industries. The round was led by Japan’s SoftBank Group. —Boston-based healthtech startup Iora Health raised a $75 million Series D round led by Singapore-based Temasek. Here’s more on the startup, which runs primary care clinics imbued with software that helps track patients’ health. AND IN OTHER NEWS… —New York-based Intercept Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ICPT) said that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use has recommended conditional approval of obeticholic acid (Ocaliva) in Europe to treat patients with the rare liver disease primary biliary cirrhosis. The drug is already approved to treat PBC in the U.S. —Adaptimmune Therapeutics (NASDAQ: ADAP) said Wednesday it has changed the protocol for its ovarian cancer treatment in a Phase 1/2a trial. The stock price was down 10 percent as of Thursday’s close. —Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: REGN) will team with Ocular Therapeutix (NASDAQ: OCUL) to develop a long-lasting version of its flagship eye drug, aflibercept (Eylea).

News Sports Living Obits Item Banner Cars Jobs E-Edition Subscriber Services log in Site Archive 10 years after UMass researcher Craig Mello earns Nobel, search for RNAi-related treatments continues Sunday Oct 16, 2016 at 11:13 AM Oct 17, 2016 at 1:08 PM Lisa Eckelbecker Telegram & Gazette Staff @LisaEckelbecker WORCESTER - When researcher Craig C. Mello learned 10 years ago he would share the Nobel Prize in medicine for uncovering a way to silence genes, the researcher stood before his colleagues at the University of Massachusetts Medical School and offered what might as well have been a challenge. “My deepest hope is that this will lead to therapeutics that will help people,” he said. Finally, after a decade of hype, dashed hopes and perseverance, researchers are getting closer to realizing that hope. A handful of companies, mostly in the United States, are plunging forward with experimental products using RNAi, or RNA interference, to tackle everything from surgical scars to diseases that originate in the liver. Many more scientists are studying whether RNAi might treat the virus that causes AIDS and other dangerous disorders. “It was a fascinating ride, absolutely fabulous ride,” said Anastasia Khvorova, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, who is researching ways to carry gene-blocking molecules known as oligonucleotides, including RNAi, into tissues other than the liver. “I am, for sure, conflicted, because I have been developing drugs out of oligonucleotides for the last 20 years. At this point, it’s kind of personal to get it to work. I think at this point, RNAi is coming of age.” RNA is a naturally occurring molecule that plays a critical role in life. RNA copies and conveys genetic information from DNA, the genetic blueprints to life that are nestled inside cells. Short strands of RNA can also shut down individual genes. In 1998, Mr. Mello and collaborator Andrew Fire, now of Stanford University, demonstrated RNAi in tiny laboratory worms. Three years later, researchers in Germany reported they had used RNAi to silence genes in the cells of mammals. Science, the influential journal, named small RNAs the scientific breakthrough of the year in 2002. Biotechnology investors and entrepreneurs took note, jumping in with millions of dollars to start companies and lock down patents in the emerging field. In 2006, the same year Mr. Mello and Mr. Fire won the Nobel Prize in medicine, the drugmaker Merck & Co. paid $1.1 billion to acquire Sirna Therapeutics, an RNAi company. A year later, Roche Holding AG, another big pharma company, paid $330 million to license RNAi therapies from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Cambridge. Yet the early enthusiasm soon waned, as researchers scrambled to find ways to get RNAi molecules into the body – and to the correct location – without degrading, setting off immune reactions, or being swept away by normal cellular processes. Some groups tried injecting RNAi molecules directly into targeted tissues, while others looked to stabilize RNAi molecules and wrap them in “delivery vehicles” that could navigate through the body’s bloodstream to hone in on targeted cells, according to Pamela A. Pavco, chief development officer of RXi Pharmaceutical Corp. of Marlboro. RXi is going the first route, developing RNAi molecules that can be injected into skin or the eyes to treat scarring or vision disorders. As with any new technology, the initial reaction to RNAi was, “Wow, this is the coolest thing,” she said. “Then there were year and years of trying to figure out how to work with it.” There was also what independent RNAi expert Dirk Haussecker called a “general backlash” between 2008 and 2011. Merck, just a few years after its investment in Sirna, pared back its RNAi spending and then, in 2014, sold it to Alnylam. Roche’s assets ended up in the hands of Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Pasadena. Scientists kept working, however, and found ways to deliver RNAi into cells by encasing them in lipid nanoparticles and linking them with sugars. Early studies showed that RNAi molecules ended up in the liver, so some companies focused on diseases that involve the liver. That’s the case with Alnylam, which now has products in human studies for eight different conditions. The company’s lead product is patisiran, now in the third and final phase of testing as a treatment for hereditary ATTR amyloidosis, a disease in which proteins made in the liver accumulate in nerve cells. If the drug succeeds, it could hit the market in 2018. “It turns out that the liver is a treasure trove of genetically valid targets that are implicated in a number of diseases,” said Alnylam president Barry Greene. “Our diseases aren’t liver diseases. They are diseases, however, where the protein that we’re targeting is synthesized in the liver. By doing so, we can have an impact on the disease.” More than a dozen RNAi therapeutics are now in clinical trials for ailments such as hepatitis B, and some big investors such as Roche have even returned to the field with new deals. Some estimates put the market for RNAi therapeutics at more than $4 billion by 2022. Still, some setbacks continue. Alnylam recently reported it was discontinuing work on its drug revusiran, which was in the final phase of human testing, amid reports of patients experiencing the nerve condition known as peripheral neuropathy. Researchers said they don’t expect setbacks to thwart the field of RNAi, and they compare its arc to that of monoclonal antibodies, another biomedical technology that took years to come to market but is now producing important therapies. “I spent my career working on this because I really believe something is going to come out some day,” said Ms. Pavco, of RXi. “I think a lot of the hurdles have been worked out. We’re getting closer to that every day.” Contact Lisa Eckelbecker at lisa.eckelbecker@telegram.com. Follow her on Twitter @LisaEckelbecker.

Ogg October 15, 2016 11:35 am EST Print Email Tweet The week of October 14 was a volatile one, considering how there has been a lack of volatility most of the summer. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) ended the week down roughly 102 points at 18,138.38. Still, investors have become prone to buying their favorite stocks any time the market sells off. High valuations, and even the notion that this bull market is now seven and a half years old, have not thwarted investor appetites. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports each morning, and this ends up being hundreds of analyst calls each week. Our goal is to find new investing and trading ideas for our readers. Some of these reports cover stocks to buy that are blue chip stocks. When investors hear the word “blue chip” it generally means DJIA stocks with solid dividends. Sometimes this also refers to former Dow stocks, or stocks that might become Dow stocks. Here, we stick by the traditional Dow stocks. Here were six solid Buy ratings (which includes equivalent Outperform or Overweight ratings) issued in the blue chips during the week of October 14. Just remember: sometimes analysts are wrong, and even the great blue chip stocks come with no guarantees. Apple Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been on a serious recovery. The iPhone maker is winning from Samsung’s smartphone recall and cancellation, and Apple finished up 3.1% this week at $117.66, for a 13% gain so far in 2016. It turns out that multiple analysts raised their targets, either on share price targets or on their estimates for sales and earnings. 24/7 Wall St. tracked several major analyst calls this last week, with Credit Suisse even calling for $150 per share next year, and it even shows a trend of more upgraded estimates the prior week as well. Apple has a 52-week trading range of $89.47 to $123.82, and it has a Thomson Reuters consensus analyst price target of $127.59. Most investors do not buy Apple for its yield, but the company is buying back stock rapidly, and it still comes with almost a 2% dividend yield to boot. Caterpillar It would appear that Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) is in a stealth turnaround. The company’s numbers are still bad, and the trends look in decline from prior growth years. Still, sometimes the investing community treats value and serious stock sell-offs differently. Amazingly, Caterpillar is the top performing Dow stock of 2016, with a gain of 33% so far this year, and it still pays a 3.5% dividend yield. Caterpillar was raised to Buy from Neutral with a $112 price target at Goldman Sachs on October 11. The prior close was $88.22, and Caterpillar ended the week at $87.67. Its 52-week range is $56.36 to $89.87, and its consensus analyst target is $77.37. Investors need to consider that this is the highest analyst target of all now, and Goldman Sachs expects margin expansion and an earnings recovery much greater than investors have expected. Merck While Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) remains close to a 52-week high, investors should not overlook the fact that it is up 20.5% so far in 2016. Merrill Lynch raised its rating on the stock to Buy from Neutral on October 13. Its price objective was raised to $70 from $57 as well, and that is above the $67.79 consensus target. Note that the Merrill Lynch call is based on compelling data for its Keytruda first line lung cancer drug. The firm sees it becoming the standard of care and having 25% share. Merck has a 52-week trading range of $47.97 to $64.86, and its dividend yield is right a 3%. Nike Nike Inc. (NYSE: NKE) has been down and out in 2016, logging the worst performance this year of all 30 Dow stocks with close to a 17% negative return. That isn’t the growth engine we were used to. After the latest earnings report offered disappointing futures sales, Susquehanna decided that enough is enough. The firm raised Nike’s rating to Positive from Neutral on October 11, and it assigned a $63 price target too. The prior closing price was $51.79. The consensus price target now is $63.71, though Thomson Reuters showed a consensus of closer to $67 just 90 days ago. Nike close out the week at $51.62 a share, and its 52-week range is $51.48 to $68.19. The dividend yield is currently only 1.25%, but the company has much more room to grow that payout in the years ahead. Procter & Gamble It may still be a boring blue chip in consumer products, but Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG) just keeps chugging along. Now it has a brand sale under its belt in the long road of restructuring into a slimmer and more core-focused company. Independent research firm Argus came out swinging here, saying that the street is grossly undervaluing the growth prospects and underestimating its value. Argus raised the stock to a Buy from Hold on October 12, and it assigned a $103 price target as well. This target compared with a prior close of $88.54, as well as a 52-week trading range of $73.50 to $90.33. The consensus price target at Thomson Reuters is $92.28. Procter & Gamble still comes with an impressive 4% dividend yield, and it has been among the few 50-year dividend gainers and likely will keep raising that payout ahead.

Home Issues Experts Newsletters & Trading Services Login Prescription drug prices are out of control Posted on October 15, 2016 by Brad Hoppmann If you’re one of the 3-in-5 Americans who take prescription drugs, your pocketbook may be getting crushed as a result. In the U.S., we now spend over $309 billion on prescription drugs every single year. That’s a rise of over 38% in just the last two years! This staggering price increase isn’t because people are using more meds, though. It’s because pharmaceutical companies can get away with charging more. And hospitals, doctors and patients who need the medicine have little choice except to pay up. Both generic and branded drug prices are increasing as well, eliminating once-more-affordable alternatives. And the most-expensive drugs aren’t necessarily new and innovative miracle cures. In fact, many are commonly used and have been on the market for decades. For Americans, prescription drugs are becoming one of the biggest financial burdens we face. Especially for retirees who could never have predicted or planned for this. You really only have two options when a medicine you take increases in price: 1. Make monetary sacrifices elsewhere to afford the new rate, or 2. Stop taking the drugs altogether and face the consequences. For most people, option two isn’t even an option. If you’ve been reading my Afternoon Editions for any length of time, you know that I am a fan of free markets, free minds and the free choice of individuals to do what they want with their hard-earned money. That also means having a healthy dose of skepticism when it comes to government solutions that come in the forms of more laws and regulations. Especially when the biggest beneficiaries aren’t the citizens themselves … Consider that Big Pharma has spent $3.4 billion in federal lobbying since 1998 — more than any other industry — to get lawmakers on the payroll and make sure no one gets in their way. One of the most-famous cases of pharmaceutical price-gouging came in late 2015. That was when Martin Shkreli, now-former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, raised the price of the drug Daraprim by 5,000%. Although price hikes like this have happened before, Shkreli instantly became public enemy No. 1 for his complete lack of empathy toward consumers. Unapologetic to this day, the former CEO doubled down on his decision by saying, “I would have raised prices even higher.” Related story: A Smirk of Defiance, or Just Dumb Hubris? Daraprim is used to treat a rare condition known as toxoplasmosis. It is only prescribed to around 2,000 patients in the U.S. For as notorious as Shkreli has become, not that many people use Daraprim and thus were mostly affected by the increase. Then there is pharmaceutical supplier Mylan, which took the price-hiking practice much further when it raised the prices of its popular allergen injection, the EpiPen. Mylan acquired the decades-old product in 2007 when pharmacies paid less than $100 for a two-pen set. Since then, the company has been steadily raising the price of this life-saving device. Related story: Price-gouging; the Senator’s Daughter; Cover from Washington In 2009, a pharmacy paid $103.50 for a set. By July 2013 the price was up to $264.50, and it rose 75% to $461 by last May. This May, the price spiked again to $608.61. Unlike the small group effected by the Daraprim increase, 3.6 million Americans were prescribed EpiPens last year. This type of price hike has a much greater impact and has affected the livelihood of millions of families in the U.S. Meanwhile, Mylan CEO Heather Bresch’s annual compensation has soared more than 700%, to $19 million. These examples, while extreme, are far from unusual … Take a look at some of the other recent price increases involving the most prescribed drugs in America …  Pfizer’s pain medication Lyrica jumped 45% on a per-prescription basis between 2014 and 2013, according to Medicare data.  Lantus, a popular form of insulin, jumped 41% on a per-prescription basis, reaching $403 in 2014 from $285 in the prior year.  Merck’s cholesterol medication, Zetia, had a 21% jump in per-prescription prices in 2014, rising to $290.  Abilify, used to treat a number of psychiatric illnesses, rose 17% in the last year. It’s not like this is happening behind closed doors, either. But there is something we can do about it. And it starts at the ballot box. Now, I know many of you are frustrated with what’s happening at the national political level, and I don’t blame you. However, there are state and local races where you can also make your voice heard. California is voting this upcoming November on Proposition 61, which would enact various forms of price regulation. A similar type of bill is being voted on in Ohio in 2017.

Happy and healthy investing, Brad Hoppmann Your thoughts on “Prescription drug prices are out of control” Books says: October 15, 2016 at 9:14 am My daughter has very bad health, goes to doctors often, and requires prescriptions. She is a low income person, but not low enough for Medicaid. Her Rx costs are killing her and killing us, since we try to help her out. The only thing good in this picture is the rule of Obamacare that insurance companies can’t dump you for pre-existing health issues, or she would be totally screwed. The obscene pay of CEO’s is causing much disgust in the average person. Reply David Broomhall says: October 15, 2016 at 9:52 am You may not want to call a ballot proposition to lower drug prices government interference in free markets, but that’s what it is. Propositions allow citizens to enact legislation that the politicians are too bought-and-paid for to enact on their own. And this proposition doesn’t go far enough. Why should we pay higher prices for drugs manufactured in the US than citizens in Canada and many other countries pay? Contrary to what you believe, there really are things that governments can do to improve the lives of its citizens that cannot be achieved through free markets. Read the section on market failure in most any basic economics textbook for the conditions under which government action may be improve markets. We may disagree about when and under what conditions government action leads to improvement, but I doubt we’d disagree that there are situations in which government action is an improvement. The list is long, and includes things like safety belts, pollution control, standards (how do you know you get a gallon of gas when you buy a gallon of gas?), insider trading, food labeling, etc. If you want to live without these things go live in a banana republic.

Reply Deborah says: October 15, 2016 at 10:08 am We went to Mexico for a few weeks last year. While there I thought I’d would find out how much an in hailer I use cost there. This is a very common drug, an old drug used by many. Here the cost is well over 300 dollars in Mexico 35 dollars US. I was one astounded person how can this be? I mentioned this to my doctor and the answer to me was that it is agnist the law to bring back drugs from a forgien country please don’t mention this to me again. Truly we have no hope here in the US they the Gov would have us starve, lose our homes and become a ward of the STATE rather than address this problem. Reply Bob says: October 15, 2016 at 10:08 am Drug companies charge what they want because as they say “nobody pays for their drugs”. they are paid for by welfare or insurance. Do away with both; make everyone responsible for their own drug costs. If the prescriber writes for a $200 rx the patient will likely go back to the prescriber and ask for something more reasonable pricewise. When this is repeated enough times the prescriber gets smarter and stops writing for needlessly expensive drugs. When the drug companies can’t sell the over priced drugs I bet prices come down. Reply David says: October 15, 2016 at 10:16 am Ironically, over the counter drugs and vitamins cost in addition to the RX prescriptions hurt us too. My wife had bariatric surgery 6 years ago. She must take daily vitamins and special RX that works with a golf ball size stomach. Bottom line, through Medicare our RX cost less than over the counter drugs! Reply alan rodrigo says: October 15, 2016 at 10:28 am increase of prescription drugs prices are unacceptable at all.It is very unfair for these pharmaceutical companies to increase the drugs prices as and when they want to increase the companies profits by keeping patients life at a risk and withdraw heavy pay check at the expense of patients.My request to those CEOS is think and act as a human being and help fellow human beings in need of help not act like, Shylock like attitude asking !flesh of pound for flesh of pound!Last but not least Earn to live but not live to earn. Reply CHRIS KARSA says: October 15, 2016 at 10:50 am It is time for individual States to enact legislation to curb corporate greed and overreach. Congress is bought and paid for, members often pushing through legislation that has the sole purpose of increasing the corporations’ bottom line. We can not expect CEO s of corporations to act any differently than what has been seen. Get involved before corporations bankrupt all of us! Reply greg dillon says: October 15, 2016 at 11:03 am this is a perfect example of the rights old tired mantra ” if we would just get rid of government controls and let free enterprise take command the country will prosper and we will all be financially rewarded” which is a load of you know what as we watch ceo,s income go thru the roof. because of corporate greed we do need government control so the sick and elderly can continue to live! Reply Bob Cornelius says: October 15, 2016 at 12:14 pm Brad, I”m confused. First, you make the case that government regulation has been hijacked by the drug companies. Presumably this has raised the bar for entry into the market and stifled competition. Then you seem to advocate price controls, which always lead to shortages. Government meddling is the problem, not the solution. Sure, regulation of pharmaceuticals is necessary, but it must be fair, efficient and transparent. Reply Mel, rph says: October 15, 2016 at 2:10 pm I have been a pharmacist for 44 years and you are right..excessive price raises and control over market forces have been going on forever..some drugs up 40x. Never effective pushback from society. To make it worse you’re right the major drug cos are gobbling up their generic competitors and rapidly raising prices on most all products. Their money-buying influence on decision-maker is also obscene. Society SHOULD NOT be held hostage by this industry. Price controls are SO LONG overdue. It’s no wonder the public distrusts our elected officials. They are part of this HUGE growing prices. Its interesting big pharmacy has kept the best source of affordable decision making out of the hands of pharmacists..the most unbiased source of good therapy. Reply Mel, rph says: October 15, 2016 at 2:13 pm See previous post sent in..do the right thing and fix the problem (gutless congressmen and controlling industry). Use the pharmacists knowledge as gatekeeper told logically oversee this awful growing problem Reply Maylene Anderson says: October 15, 2016 at 2:15 pm As long as the lobbyists are allowed this will happen . My son in law is losing his battle with cancer . He asked a doctor at Mayo Clinic about a newer, proven, treatment , doctors response , “why are you asking , you couldn’t afford it anyway” . People are more and more interested in homeopathic medicine now but government is trying to shut that down due to drug companies paying them to do so . Reply Larry says: October 15, 2016 at 7:15 pm Rather than more regulation I wonder why competitors don’t come along and sell the same drugs at cheaper prices. Do these companies have patents that disallow that? Surely there are alternatives in a lot of cases. I suspect that the heavy regulation from FDA and Obamacare contribute to this situation by making it very difficult to offer cheaper or alternative choices. Reply David Broomhall says: October 16, 2016 at 5:51 pm Well, Larry, I can think of two reasons why competitors don’t come along and sell the same drugs at cheaper prices. First, patent laws prevent all but the patent owner from manufacturing the drug for a certain number of years to encourage investment and innovation. If a drug company spent billions of dollars investing in a drug and another company could swoop in and manufacture it, no company would undertake the initial investment, and we would underinvest in drugs. The second reason is that when a drug comes off patent, other companies are allowed to manufacture the drug and undercut prices. However, since the drug patent owner stands to lose a lot of profit when there is competition, some drug companies will actually pay competitors not to manufacture a drug, thus allowing the patent owning company to keep prices high. It’s cheaper to pay a company not to manufacture than to compete with it. Why this is legal, I can’t say, but it sure should be. I suspect that the fact that the pharmaceutical industry spends more on lobbying than any other industry has something to do with it. Reply Dick Gustafon says: October 16, 2016 at 1:11 pm YES We need to do something;; Especially for drugs etc I suggest the GOVERNMENT = PEOPLE should NOT regulate.. BUT compete: make a manufacturing or bidding entity that SELLS at 150% of costs for any egregiously priced drug or other item especially health that is going on in the private sector; I’d be happy to suffer any start up/shut down costs; perhaps include a ramp down price schedule 500% -> 150% over 10 years for GENUINELY NEW in house developed drugs/products… MAKE COMPETITION WORK and have a generous reward UNDER THE GOV PRICE; Make it transparent ; what BETTER mission for the FDA?? Dick Gustafson genuinely NEW products developments Reply Loretta T says: October 16, 2016 at 9:22 pm my problem isn’t life or death but it sure makes me mad. hard to believe how greedy some people are. I have psoriasis. nothing that I will die of but my ointment has gone from $95 a 6mg tube in 2015 thanks to my drug insurance. I’m a senior. this year my prescription has gone up to $300 with my drug insurance. they pay 50% so the full charge is $600 a tube. noooo, this isn’t a life saving drug. btw, this is the GENERIC of the original drug. I fully intend on writing the ceo of this company and the cfo. I just haven’t decided whether I should write a letter and kill them with kindness or write one that tells them what I REALLY think. yes, I blame Washington for taking bribes. something HAS to be done and done soon.
