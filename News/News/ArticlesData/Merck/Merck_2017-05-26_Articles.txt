(May 25, 2017) —  Optum, the health services business of UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH), and Merck (NYSE: MRK, known as MSD outside the U.S. and Canada), will collaborate to develop and simulate the performance of contractual reimbursement models in which payment for prescription drugs is aligned more closely with patient health outcomes. Through a multi-year collaboration on a shared “Learning Laboratory,” the companies will explore value-based and pay-for-performance models, known as Outcomes-Based Risk Sharing Agreements (OBRSAs), and their potential for broad adoption among health insurance companies, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), and pharmaceutical companies. The initiative will involve the use of real world data to co-develop and test advanced predictive models and co-design OBRSAs to reduce clinical and financial uncertainty with respect to payment for prescription drugs. Under OBRSAs, health plans and other payers reimburse drug manufacturers on the basis of clinical outcomes achieved. Prices can fall or rise if the results succeed or fail to meet expectations outlined in the agreement. Increasingly, OBRSAs have become part of the conversation across the health care system due to the desire by health plans, care providers, PBMs, and pharmaceutical companies to base reimbursements on evidence-based outcomes. Because the measuring and monitoring of clinical outcomes is crucial to the viability and applicability of these models, Optum’s integrated claims and clinical records will be used to provide data reflective of real world patient care and outcomes in the United States. These data assets will enable the companies to assess OBRSA models across different patient populations, clinical settings, and therapeutic areas aligned with Merck’s product portfolio. “Ensuring that health care dollars are spent on interventions that improve patient care and health outcomes is a shared goal for all stakeholders,” said Curt Medeiros, president of Optum Life Sciences. “This collaboration offers an opportunity to leverage our collective strengths to increase knowledge about the design and implementation of outcomes-based contracts in the U.S. health system.” Optum and Merck plan to publicly share analytic insights, findings and recommendations to help inform and facilitate the understanding and use of pragmatic approaches to OBRSAs in the health care system. “Our collaboration will create a unique data-driven platform to enable modeling and analysis of innovative contracts that are needed to move to a value-based health care model,” said Susan Shiff, senior vice president, Center for Observational and Real-world Evidence, Merck. “The collaboration between Merck and Optum will help advance both organizations’ common goals of improving patient health outcomes, expanding access to innovative therapies, and ensuring the best use of health care spending.” Optum provides expertise in pharmaceutical contracting, health economic and outcomes research, actuarial analytics, and health policy and regulation, as well as access to data required for exploration of these new models. Merck provides data science and outcomes research expertise, a deep understanding of the pharmaceuticals marketplace, and years of experience working with large private and public customers to create flexible pricing models across multiple therapy areas. About Optum Optum is a leading information and technology-enabled health services business dedicated to helping make the health system work better for everyone. With more than 115,000 people worldwide, Optum delivers intelligent, integrated solutions that help to modernize the health system and improve overall population health.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 26 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman FDA Approves Mercks KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) for Adult and Pediatric Patients with Unresectable or Metastatic, Microsatellite Instability-High (MSI-H) or Mismatch Repair Deficient (dMMR) Solid Tumors KENILWORTH, N.J. – Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), the company’s anti-PD-1 (programmed death receptor-1) therapy, for a first-of-its-kind indication: the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic, microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient, solid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options or colorectal cancer that has progressed following treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. This indication is approved under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. The safety and effectiveness of KEYTRUDA in pediatric patients with MSI-H central nervous system cancers have not been established. Immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred with KEYTRUDA including pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, and nephritis. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, KEYTRUDA should be withheld or discontinued and corticosteroids administered if appropriate. KEYTRUDA can also cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions; for Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab). Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Female patients of reproductive potential should be advised of the potential hazard to a fetus. For more information regarding immune-mediated and infusion-related adverse reactions and use in pregnancy, see “Selected Important Safety Information” below. “The FDA’s approval of this first-of-its-kind, tumor-agnostic, indication is further evidence of Merck’s commitment to helping people with difficult-to-treat cancers, and to advancing the use of biomarkers to guide clinical decision-making,” said Dr. Roger M. Perlmutter, president, Merck Research Laboratories. “This is a remarkable time in the field of oncology and we are thankful to the researchers, especially the scientists and clinicians at Johns Hopkins University for their important scientific work, as well as the patients and their families who helped make today’s approval possible.” Microsatellite instability (or MSI) is defined by the National Cancer Institute as a change that occurs in the DNA of certain cells (such as tumor cells) in which the number of repeats of microsatellites (short, repeated sequences of DNA) is different from the number of repeats that was in the DNA when it was inherited. The cause of microsatellite instability may be a defect in the ability to repair mistakes made when DNA is copied in the cell. This defect is also referred to as mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). “This is the first time in the history of oncology that a cancer medicine has been approved by the FDA using a pan-tumor predictive biomarker rather than a tumor-specific approach,” said Dr. Luis A. Diaz, Jr., head of the Division of Solid Tumor Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. “This approval for KEYTRUDA is a transformational milestone in our progress toward personalized immunotherapy, offering certain patients with difficult-to-treat cancers a medicine based on the genetic makeup of the tumor – regardless of tumor type.” “Swim Across America’s mission is to help advance cancer research,” said Rob Butcher, CEO of Swim Across America. “We are honored that our organization supported some of the initial research conducted by Dr. Diaz and team, which has now contributed to the approval of KEYTRUDA for this new indication.” Merck currently has the largest immuno-oncology clinical development program, including multiple registration-enabling studies investigating KEYTRUDA as monotherapy in MSI-H cancer. Data Supporting the Approval This accelerated FDA approval for KEYTRUDA was based on efficacy data evaluated in patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) solid tumors enrolled in one of five uncontrolled, open-label, multi-cohort, multi-center, single-arm trials. Patients with active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible across the five trials. The first study, KEYNOTE-016, was initiated by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute. Across all studies, patients received either KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) 200 mg every three weeks or 10 mg/kg every two weeks until unacceptable toxicity; or disease progression that was symptomatic, was rapidly progressive, required urgent intervention, or occurred with a decline in performance status; or a maximum of 24 months. For the purpose of assessment of anti-tumor activity across these five trials, the major efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate (ORR) as assessed by blinded independent central radiologists’ (BICR) review according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 and duration of response. A total of 149 patients with MSI-H or dMMR cancers were identified across the five clinical trials. Among these 149 patients, the baseline characteristics were: median age 55 years (36% age 65 or older); 56 percent male; 77 percent White, 19 percent Asian, two percent Black; and ECOG PS 0 (36%) or 1 (64%). Ninety-eight percent of patients had metastatic disease and two percent had locally advanced, unresectable disease. The median number of prior therapies for metastatic or unresectable disease was two. Eighty-four percent of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and 53 percent of patients with other solid tumors received two or more prior lines of therapy. The identification of MSI-H or dMMR tumor status for the majority of patients (n=135/149) was prospectively determined using local laboratory-developed, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for MSI-H status or immunohistochemistry (IHC) tests for dMMR. Fourteen of the 149 patients were retrospectively identified as MSI-H by testing tumor samples from a total of 415 patients using a central laboratory developed PCR test. Forty-seven patients had dMMR cancer identified by IHC, 60 had MSI-H identified by PCR, and 42 were identified using both tests. Across all five trials, the efficacy analysis showed an ORR of 39.6 percent (95% CI: 31.7, 47.9) with a complete response rate of 7.4 percent and a partial response rate of 32.2 percent. At the time of data cutoff, median duration of response had not yet been reached (range 1.6+ to 22.7+ months), with 78 percent of responding patients having responses of six months or longer.   In patients with colorectal cancer (n=90), the ORR was 36 percent (95% CI: 26%, 46%) with a duration of response ranging from 1.6+ to 22.7+ months; in patients with other solid tumors (n=59), which included endometrial cancer, biliary cancer, gastric cancer or GE junction cancer, pancreatic cancer, small intestinal cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, bladder cancer, esophageal cancer, sarcoma, thyroid cancer, retroperitoneal adenocarcinoma, small cell lung cancer, and renal cell cancer, the ORR was 46 percent (95% CI: 33%, 59%) with a duration of response ranging from 1.9+ to 22.1+ months.   The safety profile observed in patients with MSI-H or dMMR tumors was consistent with previously reported safety data. For KEYTRUDA, the most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) were fatigue, pruritus, diarrhea, decreased appetite, rash, pyrexia, cough, dyspnea, musculosketal pain, constipation, and nausea. There is limited experience with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) in pediatric patients. In a study, 40 pediatric patients with advanced melanoma, lymphoma, or PD-L1 positive advanced, relapsed, or refractory solid tumors were treated with KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg every three weeks. Patients received KEYTRUDA for a median of three doses (range 1-17 doses), with 34 patients (85%) receiving KEYTRUDA for two doses or more. The concentrations of KEYTRUDA in pediatric patients were comparable to those observed in adult patients at the same dose regimen of 2 mg/kg every three weeks. The safety profile in these pediatric patients was similar to that seen in adults treated with KEYTRUDA. Toxicities that occurred at a higher rate (≥15% difference) in pediatric patients when compared to adults under 65 years of age were fatigue (45%), vomiting (38%), abdominal pain (28%), hypertransaminasemia (28%) and hyponatremia (18%). Efficacy for pediatric patients with MSI-H cancers was extrapolated from the results in the adult MSI-H population. The safety and effectiveness of KEYTRUDA in pediatric patients with MSI-H central nervous system cancers have not been established.  About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) 100 mg Injection KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. Studies of KEYTRUDA – from the largest immuno-oncology program in the industry with more than 500 trials – include a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand factors that predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including the exploration of several different biomarkers across a broad range of tumors.  KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications and Dosing Melanoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma at a dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Lung Cancer KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥50%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab), as a single agent, is also indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and progression-free survival. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In metastatic NSCLC, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. When administering KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy, KEYTRUDA should be administered prior to chemotherapy when given on the same day. See also the Prescribing Information for pemetrexed and carboplatin.

This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In HNSCC, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression.  Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), or who have relapsed after three or more prior lines of therapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In adults with cHL, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. In pediatric patients with cHL, KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) is administered at a dose of 2 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 200 mg) every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression.  Urothelial Carcinoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. In locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression.  Microsatellite Instability–High (MSI-H) Cancer KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic, microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient solid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options, or colorectal cancer that has progressed following treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory studies. The safety and effectiveness of KEYTRUDA in pediatric patients with microsatellite instability-high central nervous system cancers have not been established. In adult patients with MSI-H cancer, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. In children with MSI-H cancer, KEYTRUDA is administered at a dose of 2 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 200 mg) every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression.  Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 94 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%) pneumonitis, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (6.9%) compared to those without (2.9%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 48 (1.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) colitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 19 (0.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%) hepatitis. Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.   KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis. Hypophysitis occurred in 17 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%) hypophysitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency). Administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. KEYTRUDA can cause thyroid disorders, including hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and thyroiditis. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 96 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%) hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism occurred in 237 (8.5%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%) hypothyroidism. Thyroiditis occurred in 16 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%) thyroiditis. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. Administer replacement hormones for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) can cause type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 9 (0.3%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis. KEYTRUDA can cause other clinically important immune-mediated adverse reactions. These immune-mediated reactions may involve any organ system. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction. The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), exfoliative dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid, rash (1.4%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, and partial seizures arising in a patient with inflammatory foci in brain parenchyma. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and postmarketing use. Solid organ transplant rejection has been reported in postmarketing use of KEYTRUDA. Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider benefit of treatment with KEYTRUDA vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients. KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions, including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after being treated with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab). Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA on any trial, 6 patients (26%) developed graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), one of which was fatal, and 2 patients (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning, one of which was fatal. Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody before transplantation. These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute GVHD, severe (Grade 3 to 4) acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic VOD, and other immune-mediated adverse reactions, and intervene promptly. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of KEYTRUDA. Most common adverse reactions (reported in ≥20% of patients) were fatigue, pruritus, diarrhea, decreased appetite, rash, pyrexia, cough, dyspnea, musculoskeletal pain, constipation, and nausea. It is not known whether KEYTRUDA is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, instruct women to discontinue nursing during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the final dose.  Our Focus on Cancer Our goal is to translate breakthrough science into innovative oncology medicines to help people with cancer worldwide.

This indication is approved under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. The safety and effectiveness of KEYTRUDA in pediatric patients with MSI-H central nervous system cancers have not been established. Immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred with KEYTRUDA including pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, and nephritis. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, KEYTRUDA should be withheld or discontinued and corticosteroids administered if appropriate. KEYTRUDA can also cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions; for Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab). Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Female patients of reproductive potential should be advised of the potential hazard to a fetus. For more information regarding immune-mediated and infusion-related adverse reactions and use in pregnancy, see “Selected Important Safety Information” below. “The FDA’s approval of this first-of-its-kind, tumor-agnostic, indication is further evidence of Merck’s commitment to helping people with difficult-to-treat cancers, and to advancing the use of biomarkers to guide clinical decision-making,” said Dr. Roger M. Perlmutter, president, Merck Research Laboratories. “This is a remarkable time in the field of oncology and we are thankful to the researchers, especially the scientists and clinicians at Johns Hopkins University for their important scientific work, as well as the patients and their families who helped make today’s approval possible.” Microsatellite instability (or MSI) is defined by the National Cancer Institute as a change that occurs in the DNA of certain cells (such as tumor cells) in which the number of repeats of microsatellites (short, repeated sequences of DNA) is different from the number of repeats that was in the DNA when it was inherited. The cause of microsatellite instability may be a defect in the ability to repair mistakes made when DNA is copied in the cell. This defect is also referred to as mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). “This is the first time in the history of oncology that a cancer medicine has been approved by the FDA using a pan-tumor predictive biomarker rather than a tumor-specific approach,” said Dr. Luis A. Diaz, Jr., head of the Division of Solid Tumor Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. “This approval for KEYTRUDA is a transformational milestone in our progress toward personalized immunotherapy, offering certain patients with difficult-to-treat cancers a medicine based on the genetic makeup of the tumor – regardless of tumor type.” “Swim Across America’s mission is to help advance cancer research,” said Rob Butcher, CEO of Swim Across America. “We are honored that our organization supported some of the initial research conducted by Dr. Diaz and team, which has now contributed to the approval of KEYTRUDA for this new indication.” Merck currently has the largest immuno-oncology clinical development program, including multiple registration-enabling studies investigating KEYTRUDA as monotherapy in MSI-H cancer. Data Supporting the Approval This accelerated FDA approval for KEYTRUDA was based on efficacy data evaluated in patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) solid tumors enrolled in one of five uncontrolled, open-label, multi-cohort, multi-center, single-arm trials. Patients with active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible across the five trials. The first study, KEYNOTE-016, was initiated by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute. Across all studies, patients received either KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) 200 mg every three weeks or 10 mg/kg every two weeks until unacceptable toxicity; or disease progression that was symptomatic, was rapidly progressive, required urgent intervention, or occurred with a decline in performance status; or a maximum of 24 months. For the purpose of assessment of anti-tumor activity across these five trials, the major efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate (ORR) as assessed by blinded independent central radiologists’ (BICR) review according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 and duration of response. A total of 149 patients with MSI-H or dMMR cancers were identified across the five clinical trials. Among these 149 patients, the baseline characteristics were: median age 55 years (36% age 65 or older); 56 percent male; 77 percent White, 19 percent Asian, two percent Black; and ECOG PS 0 (36%) or 1 (64%). Ninety-eight percent of patients had metastatic disease and two percent had locally advanced, unresectable disease. The median number of prior therapies for metastatic or unresectable disease was two. Eighty-four percent of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and 53 percent of patients with other solid tumors received two or more prior lines of therapy. The identification of MSI-H or dMMR tumor status for the majority of patients (n=135/149) was prospectively determined using local laboratory-developed, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for MSI-H status or immunohistochemistry (IHC) tests for dMMR. Fourteen of the 149 patients were retrospectively identified as MSI-H by testing tumor samples from a total of 415 patients using a central laboratory developed PCR test. Forty-seven patients had dMMR cancer identified by IHC, 60 had MSI-H identified by PCR, and 42 were identified using both tests. Across all five trials, the efficacy analysis showed an ORR of 39.6 percent (95% CI: 31.7, 47.9) with a complete response rate of 7.4 percent and a partial response rate of 32.2 percent. At the time of data cutoff, median duration of response had not yet been reached (range 1.6+ to 22.7+ months), with 78 percent of responding patients having responses of six months or longer.   In patients with colorectal cancer (n=90), the ORR was 36 percent (95% CI: 26%, 46%) with a duration of response ranging from 1.6+ to 22.7+ months; in patients with other solid tumors (n=59), which included endometrial cancer, biliary cancer, gastric cancer or GE junction cancer, pancreatic cancer, small intestinal cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, bladder cancer, esophageal cancer, sarcoma, thyroid cancer, retroperitoneal adenocarcinoma, small cell lung cancer, and renal cell cancer, the ORR was 46 percent (95% CI: 33%, 59%) with a duration of response ranging from 1.9+ to 22.1+ months.   The safety profile observed in patients with MSI-H or dMMR tumors was consistent with previously reported safety data. For KEYTRUDA, the most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) were fatigue, pruritus, diarrhea, decreased appetite, rash, pyrexia, cough, dyspnea, musculosketal pain, constipation, and nausea. There is limited experience with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) in pediatric patients. In a study, 40 pediatric patients with advanced melanoma, lymphoma, or PD-L1 positive advanced, relapsed, or refractory solid tumors were treated with KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg every three weeks. Patients received KEYTRUDA for a median of three doses (range 1-17 doses), with 34 patients (85%) receiving KEYTRUDA for two doses or more. The concentrations of KEYTRUDA in pediatric patients were comparable to those observed in adult patients at the same dose regimen of 2 mg/kg every three weeks. The safety profile in these pediatric patients was similar to that seen in adults treated with KEYTRUDA. Toxicities that occurred at a higher rate (≥15% difference) in pediatric patients when compared to adults under 65 years of age were fatigue (45%), vomiting (38%), abdominal pain (28%), hypertransaminasemia (28%) and hyponatremia (18%). Efficacy for pediatric patients with MSI-H cancers was extrapolated from the results in the adult MSI-H population. The safety and effectiveness of KEYTRUDA in pediatric patients with MSI-H central nervous system cancers have not been established.  About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) 100 mg Injection KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. Studies of KEYTRUDA – from the largest immuno-oncology program in the industry with more than 500 trials – include a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand factors that predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including the exploration of several different biomarkers across a broad range of tumors.  KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications and Dosing Melanoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma at a dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Lung Cancer KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥50%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab), as a single agent, is also indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and progression-free survival. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In metastatic NSCLC, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. When administering KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy, KEYTRUDA should be administered prior to chemotherapy when given on the same day. See also the Prescribing Information for pemetrexed and carboplatin. Head and Neck Cancer KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In HNSCC, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression.  Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), or who have relapsed after three or more prior lines of therapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In adults with cHL, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. In pediatric patients with cHL, KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) is administered at a dose of 2 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 200 mg) every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression.  Urothelial Carcinoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. In locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression.  Microsatellite Instability–High (MSI-H) Cancer KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic, microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient solid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options, or colorectal cancer that has progressed following treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory studies. The safety and effectiveness of KEYTRUDA in pediatric patients with microsatellite instability-high central nervous system cancers have not been established. In adult patients with MSI-H cancer, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. In children with MSI-H cancer, KEYTRUDA is administered at a dose of 2 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 200 mg) every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression.  Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 94 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%) pneumonitis, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (6.9%) compared to those without (2.9%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 48 (1.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) colitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 19 (0.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%) hepatitis. Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA.   KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis. Hypophysitis occurred in 17 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%) hypophysitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency). Administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. KEYTRUDA can cause thyroid disorders, including hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and thyroiditis. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 96 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%) hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism occurred in 237 (8.5%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%) hypothyroidism. Thyroiditis occurred in 16 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%) thyroiditis. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. Administer replacement hormones for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) can cause type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 9 (0.3%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis. KEYTRUDA can cause other clinically important immune-mediated adverse reactions. These immune-mediated reactions may involve any organ system. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction. The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), exfoliative dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid, rash (1.4%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, and partial seizures arising in a patient with inflammatory foci in brain parenchyma. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and postmarketing use. Solid organ transplant rejection has been reported in postmarketing use of KEYTRUDA. Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider benefit of treatment with KEYTRUDA vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients. KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions, including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after being treated with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab). Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA on any trial, 6 patients (26%) developed graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), one of which was fatal, and 2 patients (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning, one of which was fatal. Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody before transplantation. These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute GVHD, severe (Grade 3 to 4) acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic VOD, and other immune-mediated adverse reactions, and intervene promptly. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of KEYTRUDA. Most common adverse reactions (reported in ≥20% of patients) were fatigue, pruritus, diarrhea, decreased appetite, rash, pyrexia, cough, dyspnea, musculoskeletal pain, constipation, and nausea. It is not known whether KEYTRUDA is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, instruct women to discontinue nursing during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the final dose.  Our Focus on Cancer Our goal is to translate breakthrough science into innovative oncology medicines to help people with cancer worldwide.

Science Now Discoveries from the world of science and medicine Science Science Now Immunotherapy drug opens a new era of precision medicine for cancer Mel Evans / Associated Press In a first, the FDA approved the Merck drug Keytruda this week as treatment for a wide range of cancers with a specific genetic signature. In a first, the FDA approved the Merck drug Keytruda this week as treatment for a wide range of cancers with a specific genetic signature. (Mel Evans / Associated Press) Melissa HealyContact Reporter With little fanfare, the Food and Drug Administration did something this week that it's never done before: The agency approved a single prescription drug, pembrolizumab (marketed by Merck as Keytruda) for treatment of solid tumors in any organ so long as the malignancy bears a specific genetic signature. In the fast-moving field of cancer treatment, the FDA’s announcement marks an important milestone, close to two decades in the making. Increasingly, cancer will no longer be identified, categorized and treated by the organ it inhabits, or in which it first gained its foothold. In a shift that is already underway, cancers will be known by — and treated for — the common genetic mutations that nurture and sustain them. In clinical trial evidence cited by the FDA this week, pembrolizumab induced complete or partial tumor shrinkage in about 40% of patients with one of 15 end-stage malignancies. And for 78% of those patients, that response lasted six months or more. A trial reported earlier this year found that in 17 of 30 advanced cancer patients, pembrolizumab stopped or reversed the progression of cancer, and 24 patients were still alive a year after starting the drug. All of those subjects, of course, had cancers with the genetic mutation that pembrolizumab is designed to target. In the treatment of patients with metastatic cancers that have failed all other treatments, that record of success constitutes a “home run,” said Dr. Bert Vogelstein of Johns Hopkins University’s Kimmel Cancer Center. Vogelstein’s 1993 research laid the groundwork for the discovery of pembrolizumab’s broad cancer-fighting powers. With the FDA’s announcement, drugs like pembrolizumab have also begun to change the way that physicians, patients and government regulators think of cancer. No longer will they see all cancers of the lung, breast, colon, brain, liver, pancreas and prostate as distinct from one another. Instead, they will look for the common genetic mutations that give rise to cancers no matter where they’re found. And they’ll treat those cancers with a drug that uses that common signature as a homing beacon, either for the immune system or for targeted cancer drugs to attack. It’s a key principle of what’s called “precision medicine” — the idea that cancer therapies should zero in on a tumor’s specific molecular fingerprint, and not, as most chemotherapies do, harm healthy cells in the process of attacking malignant ones. In the cancers pembrolizumab treats, the mutations occur in the complex of genes that govern DNA repair. Deficiencies in the DNA’s “mismatch repair system” generate mutant proteins on the surface of cancer cells, and pembrolizumab trains the immune system to attack those targets. The mutations that make pembrolizumab effective had already been found in melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer and Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and the FDA had already approved the drug for those cancers before this week. But this week’s FDA approval goes further: It makes clear that the drug’s molecular targets are also common in colorectal, endometrial and gastrointestinal cancers, and less frequently present in cancers of the breast, prostate, bladder, and thyroid gland. All told, scientists believe about 4% of advanced cancers bear the genetic signature that would make them treatable by Keytruda. The appearance of such a cancer workhorse will bring about profound changes on the cancer landscape — not just for patients but for researchers and drug regulators as well. Organizations representing, say, people with pancreatic cancer will make common cause with groups that advocate for colorectal cancer patients. In cancer centers, specialists in, say, melanoma will start (in fact, have already started) treating patients with a range of other cancers. When drug companies and their academic partners set out to test the effectiveness of a prospective cancer drug, they’ll have to recruit trial subjects using a new and much less obvious criterion than they’ve used in the past: the genetic signatures their tumors bear. Even before the FDA’s announcement this week, all these processes were underway. The FDA’s decision recognizes that fact, said Dr. Svetomir Markovic, an immunologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., who specializes in treating melanoma. But the decision also puts cancer physicians — as well as insurers, who will be called on to pay Keytruda’s $100,000-per-year price tag — on notice that a new era is at hand, said Markovic. “The field of cancer medicine is changing at lightning speed,” he said. Physicians “are having a hard time keeping up, and I can only imagine that people who are regulating it are doing the same,” he added. “But this decision by the FDA is really wonderful: It has made it easier for us to secure treatment for our patients who may have run out of options that may help.” Two other immunotherapy drugs have been approved for cancer treatment — nivolumab (marketed as Opdivo) and ipilimumab (Yervoy) — but neither has been shown to treat cancers across such a broad spectrum. Several other immunotherapy drugs are in early trials, and could yet prove to be the sort of workhorse that pembrolizumab appears to be. “In many ways we’re at the end of the beginning of immunotherapy: There’s clear benefit but it’s still a minority of patients that get long-term benefit,” said Markovic of the Mayo Institute. “We will get better at this.” Markovic suggested that the newly recognized powers of pembrolizumab, as well as the FDA’s new openness to cancer drugs that blur traditional distinctions, could prompt drug companies, physicians and patient groups to take a second look at some abandoned cancer drugs. With a clearer idea of which patients they might help, and a willingness to design and conduct innovative clinical trials, some failures may look more promising, he said. “We just needed to take the first step in showing that this long-believed theory — that the immune system can kill cancer — is true,” Markovic added. “It indeed can.” Caption Motion graphic shows highlights of Cassini's missions from 2004-2017.

Hypertension is one of the keyhealth issuesthat are observed in both developed as well as developing countries. It is a silent, invisible killer that rarely causes symptoms and is one of the key risk factors forcoronary heart disease and ischemic as well as hemorrhagic stroke. Hypertension can also lead to various other problemssuch as renal impairment, visual impairment, heart failure and retinal hemorrhage. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 7.5 million deaths globally are caused due to hypertension, and it accounts to 12.8% of the total deaths. Globally,in 2008 prevalence of hypertension was observed to be around 40% in adults aged 25. According to the National Health and Nutrition Evaluation Survey, ithas been noted that in United States from 2007 to 2010,81.5% of the population is aware of their hypertension condition, out of which 74% are being treated and only 52.5% are under control. Theantihypertensive drugs market based on the therapy area is classified into diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide and indapamide), calcium channel blockers (nifedipine, felodipine and diltiazem), angiotensin receptor blockers or ARBs (losartan), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)inhibitors (captopril, lisinopril and perindopril), beta blockers vasodilators (atenolol and propranolol), alpha blockers (clonidine, guanabenz), and renin inhibitors.Diuretics being the first line of treatment for hypertension holds the major share of the market. All these drug classes (drugs) have shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The drugs are administered either as a single or combined dose depending upon the stage of hypertension, whilethe choice of drugs depends upon the patients’ medical history and current conditions. View Report- www.transparencymarketresearch.com/antihypertensive-drugs… On the basis of the geography, the antihypertensive market can be segmented into North America, Europe, AsiaPacific, Latin America, and Middle East and Africa.The global antihypertensive market is dominated mainly by North America and Europe. According to the WHO, the prevalence of hypertension is highest in Africa and lowest in Americas. In Africa more than 40% of the adults suffer from hypertension and many of them remain undiagnosed due to the high cost of medications.The increased genericization by the local companies can be a challenge for the market. Similarly, in recent years, there has beena significant improvement in the management of hypertension contributing to a strong decline in the death rates in North America and Western Europe The change in lifestyle, elevated stress level, and rise in prevalent population, early detection and penetration of combined dose would be the main factors to drive the growth of antihypertensive market. The patent expiry for major drugs such as Diovan (Novartis), Cozaar (Merck),Revatio (Pfizer), Exforge (Novartis), Atacand (AstraZeneca), Avapro (Sanofi Aventis), BIopress(Takeda) and Benicar (Daiichi Sankyo), along with low diagnostics rate and increased generic penetration would result in the antihypertensive market slowdown, but the novel antihypertensive drugs in the pipeline can recover the losses of patent expiration. Some of the major key players in the global antihypertensive market includes Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., Sanofi S.A, Johnson & Johnson Ltd., Daiichi – Sankyo, Merck & Co., AstraZeneca Plc.,Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited and Lupin Limited.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: GlaxoSmithKline's New CEO Is Off to a Good Start The latest quarter gave investors in this dividend stock an encouraging glimpse into the future. Jim Crumly (TMFSpeyside) May 26, 2017 at 11:06AM Sir Andrew Witty's last quarter as CEO of GlaxoSmithKline plc (NYSE:GSK) produced positive results, and incoming leader Emma Walmsley gave some clues as to how things will be changing...or not. Q1 2017 marked the eighth reporting period since the closure of a $20 billion asset swap with Novartis, and was the latest in a series of encouraging quarters. The post-Brexit devaluation of the British pound continues to be a powerful tailwind for Glaxo's business, with sales up 19% and adjusted earnings per share up 31% year over year. Subtracting the effect of currency, sales were up 5% and EPS was up 9%. Free cash flow was $813 million as compared to negative $343 million the year earlier. Emma Walmsley. Image source: GlaxoSmithKline plc After two years of restructuring, Glaxo has achieved some balance and consistency across its three operating units. Pharmaceutical sales, comprising 57% of the total, were up 4% in constant currency, and consumer products were up 2%, both matching growth rates from last quarter. The vaccine business was a standout, up 31% in pounds sterling and 16% in constant currency. Vaccines should get a further boost in 2018 when Glaxo's potential blockbuster shingles vaccine Shingrix gets the go-ahead from the FDA. The company shared still more good news about Shingrix when it announced positive results from an in-house study of patients who had already been vaccinated with Merck's Zostavax, which is only 51% effective compared with Shingrix's efficacy of over 90%. Glaxo is continuing to do well with HIV drugs, which delivered sales of $1.23 billion, a 19% boost in constant currency thanks to the highly successful Trivicay and Triumeq. The HIV market is very competitive, but the company could get another boost from a new two-drug combination treatment that will be submitted for regulatory approval later this year. Good news on Advair The biggest worry for Glaxo investors has been the expected arrival of generic competition for blockbuster respiratory drug Advair. But newer drugs in the company's pipeline have been doing very well, and recent events have brought good news for Glaxo investors. Advair sales declined 12% in constant currency as pricing pressures have presaged the introduction of a generic. But growth in newer products more than made up for the losses, resulting in overall respiratory drug growth of 5% in constant currency. Even better for GlaxoSmithKline investors has been news that approval of a generic Advair is going to be tougher than the competition expected. In April, Mylan received the dreaded Complete Response Letter from the FDA, stating that the application for its generic Advair had been rejected in its current form. Then, earlier this month, Jordanian drug company Hikma Pharmaceuticals received an even worse notification from the FDA about its Advair knockoff, a rejection categorized as "major," leading Hikma to conclude there will be a low likelihood of approval this year. Steady as she goes Walmsley's first appearance as leader of the quarterly conference call gave analysts a chance to probe for clues as to where she will steer the company as she takes the helm. Some themes were clear from her comments. Significantly, Walmsley affirmed the strategy of maintaining the three distinct operating units combined into a diversified healthcare company. She cited the role of the vaccine and consumer businesses in providing more certain and reliable cash flows compared with the higher-margin but more volatile pharmaceutical business. Those words are music to the ears of dividend investors, who like Glaxo's stock for its generous yield, currently 4.8%. The other priorities the new CEO highlighted were a stronger focus on execution and on improving the value of the pipeline and a desire to shift the culture of the company to be more disciplined and performance oriented. None of these pronouncements is particularly shocking, to say the least. What incoming CEO wouldn't want to improve a company's execution, culture, and the value of its assets? But simply the fact that Walmsley is signaling that the company will be staying the course with a strategy that has yielded several quarters of success was reassuring to the market, with the stock rising 6% since the announcement. Some investors may have wondered whether an executive whose experience has been in consumer businesses -- Walmsley came from L'Oreal to Glaxo's consumer unit -- would have the chops to lead a company that is over half pharmaceuticals. But Novartis CEO Joseph Jimenez had previously worked for H.J. Heinz Company before moving to the Swiss drug giant a decade ago and taking over in 2010, so there is a evidence that it could work. GlaxoSmithKline continues to produce consistent results and improving profits and cash flow. Walmsley is taking over a healthcare company that is itself quite healthy, and she intends to build on the success of Witty. Investors looking for income and modest but steady growth should find the stock worthy of consideration. Jim Crumly has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool recommends Mylan.

The new director-general of the World Health Organization, who was elected this week, takes office in July with a brimming inbox and a worryingly diminished cash box. The campaign lasted many months and proved unsparing, with concerns raised over the health and human rights record of his native Ethiopia. You can read our recent Q&A with him here. But the outcome, after three rounds of secret ballots, sends a strong signal: Mr Adhanom is the first African to hold the post, and someone who has won considerable respect among his peers as a reforming health minister and past chair of two international infectious disease organisations. He will need all those skills and contacts in the years ahead. FT Health Sign up for your weekly briefing The essential guide for decision makers in health — straight to your inbox every Friday Saturday, 27 May, 2017 His biggest challenge will be to boost the reputation of the WHO as a respected norm-setting agency and co-ordinator of pandemic response. Demonstrating its commitment to fulfil these functions well offers the best prospect of renewed donor support as the US turns in on itself. His other focus will be his pledge on universal health coverage. It is an appealing notion, focused on equity and the need to respond to the rising pressure of non-communicable disease. But its vagueness and the need for individual countries to take the lead raises questions over the precise role of the WHO. With the latest White House budget estimated to leave 23m Americans uninsured, its objectives will prove difficult to achieve, in richer and poorer countries alike. Three Questions Extracted from Mr Adhanom’s post-election briefing. What is your view of universal health coverage? Health is a [human] rights issue and a means to development. It’s not actually a waste — it’s the smartest thing to invest in. All roads should lead to universal health coverage. It’s addressing the financial barrier, the challenge we are facing with regard to access to drugs, the barriers to equality, quality of care and diagnosis. Some countries want to use private services to achieve universal health coverage. Others use public services only. Yet others use a mix of private and public. Some countries use general tax, others use insurance. Others use a mix. There is no one way or [single] means of achieving [it].  What will you do about the emergency response programme? We have to implement it with a sense of urgency. It has to be geared towards implementing the international health regulations in full. We can do many of the things we’re doing now, like [rolling out] the global health security agenda . . . and identifying the gaps in implementing the [regulations]. Epidemics can strike at any time, but we have to be prepared. How will you reform the WHO? The reforms already started by the outgoing leadership should continue. And if there are new areas we need to consider, we should. But one thing that’s clear is that re-engineering the process is important. Do we have the same understanding? Do we have the same vision? And do we have concrete goals based on these priorities. Are we measuring on [a] regular basis? Do we have . . . motivated staff? For leaders, one main task should be to motivate, inspire and create [a good] work environment. Chartwatch  More than half of adults and one in six children in OECD countries are overweight or obese, with the highest levels in the US and Mexico. People with a lower level of education or socio-economic status are more likely to be affected. (OECD)  News round-up US cuts abroad . . . The White House flagged big reductions for global health programmes including a 26 per cent drop for the State Department and USAID, which represents the bulk of overseas health expenditure. Critics said this would severely damage the fight against HIV/Aids, malaria and polio as well as weakening global responses to Zika and Ebola. (Kaiser)  . . . and at home Domestic health spending was also hit, with reductions for the FDA; Medicaid, the health programme for the poor; the National Institutes of Health, which fund research; and other public health projects. Separately, the US budget watchdog said the latest iteration of Republican healthcare reforms would leave 23m more uninsured. (NYT, Stat, FT) Ebola hopes Authorities in Congo are preparing to use an experimental vaccine after a fourth death from the virus. The move is an important step towards regulatory approval for Merck’s vaccine — potentially the first for the disease. Hopes are rising that the outbreak may be smaller than first feared. (FT, Stat) National health strategies A new handbook lays out guidance on consultation, operational planning, regulation and budgeting for national health systems. (WHO/Universal Health Coverage Partnership) Drug approvals There has been a jump in approvals in the US and Europe as companies shift resources from mass-market products to more specialist medicines for rare diseases, cancer and infections that benefit from accelerated reviews. Potential big earners passed include Sanofi and Regeneron’s Dupixent (eczema), Roche’s Ocrevus (multiple sclerosis) and AstraZeneca’s durvalumab (cancer). (Reuters) Cancer first Merck’s Keytruda became the first cancer drug approved by the US FDA to treat tumours with a specific genetic feature, rather than targeting the part of the body where it originated. Keytruda is a star performer among immunotherapy drugs, which work by releasing brakes on the immune system, allowing the body to attack tumour cells. (Reuters, FT) Condom deal A Chinese consortium is paying $600m for the condom and sexual health business of Australia’s Ansell to cater for growing domestic demand for higher quality contraceptives. China’s condom market will almost triple in value to $5bn by 2024 from 2015. (FT) EMA tussle begins Brussels issued ground rules for member states to bid for the European Medicines Agency when it leaves the UK after Brexit. The EMA employs 900 specialists at its current London base and hosts 36,000 regulators and scientists each year. Some even believe Britain can cling on. (FT) UK care crisis The general election campaign was dominated by a Conservative U-turn over social care plans, dubbed a “dementia tax” by opponents. Britain’s ageing population is increasing yet care home operators find it difficult to turn a profit. The number of older people needing care in England and Wales will rise by 25 per cent by 2025. (FT, The Lancet) Depression test questioned Campaigners say doctors could be misdiagnosing depression by being too reliant on a questionnaire devised by Pfizer — a maker of antidepressant drugs. The PHQ-9 test has been widely used in UK GP surgeries for 20 years. (Telegraph) Medical microbots Microscopic devices can move through the human body to diagnose conditions, carry drugs or even perform surgery, but two big hurdles remain before clinical trials: researchers must be able to monitor the devices more clearly and have greater control while they roam our insides.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Here's How the FDA Just Helped Trump Deliver on a Big Promise A groundbreaking cancer drug approval may not have been what Trump had in mind, but a major restraint has indeed been slashed. Cory Renauer (TMFang4apples) May 26, 2017 at 7:47AM During his first speech to a joint session of Congress, President Trump vowed to "slash the restraints" put on drug development by the Food and Drug Administration. The latest approval for an already successful cancer drug from Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) may not have been exactly what he had in mind, but it is a huge step in a wildly different direction.  For decades, we've known that certain genetic markers are associated with certain types of cancer, but using this knowledge to treat patients has been stymied by the way the FDA approves drugs. Up until Tuesday, cancer drugs have always been approved for treatment of disease based on the specific body part it started in -- e.g. lung cancer, or breast cancer. On Tuesday, though, the Agency green-lighted a drug for the treatment cancer with a specific genetic feature, regardless of where the disease began. Image source: Disney-ABC Television Group, Flickr. This is a long-awaited first for the cancer community, and it will have far-reaching implications for patients, physicians, and cancer drug stocks across the board. A long time coming Following the approval, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation CEO Susan Desmond-Helland recalled a speech she had given some 20 years earlier. In that talk, she dreamed of cancer clinics where patients enter departments labeled with the names of the genetic markers that describe their disease, instead of the body parts where the tumors first appeared. We're still a long way from such a clinic, but the FDA's recent approval of Merck's Keytruda is a big step in that direction. The drug is now available for the treatment of patients with solid tumors that express specific genetic abnormalities that affect DNA repair. The markers, called microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient, are often found in cancers that begin in the colon, uterus, and stomach. Going forward, oncologists just need to find MSI-H or dMMR to treat their patients with Keytruda, even if their first tumor appeared in their left pinky toe. Image source: Getty Images. Speeding up a slow process The FDA accepted Merck's application weeks after the 2016 election, and the company likely submitted it before the votes were counted. The Keytruda genetic marker approval might not be what President Trump had in mind when he promised to shake things up at the FDA, but it will speed up the pace of medical advancement. To understand how, consider Herceptin's lengthy approval history.  The FDA granted Herceptin its first approval in 1998 for the treatment of breast cancer patients with tumors that overexpress HER2, another genetic marker. It was 12 years before it became available for patients with a form of stomach cancer with the same genetic marker.  If the FDA had initially granted Herceptin an approval for all cancer patients with tumors that overexpress HER2, breast and stomach cancer patients would have had access to the drug from the beginning. What hasn't changed If the FDA continues to approve drugs based on genetic markers without regard to where the disease begins, it will speed the availability of new medicines to those that need them. However, some aspects of the "slow and burdensome approval process" that President Trump has railed against aren't going anywhere. There simply isn't a deal to be made that will speed up biology. Generally, most cancer therapies, even exciting new ones, don't show signs they're working as expected for weeks, even months after patients begin treatment. Also, sudden tumor shrinkage has very little therapeutic value if it doesn't last very long, so it will always be necessary to follow patients for extended periods to ensure responses are durable. Therapeutic value might not carry much weight with elected officials, but it matters to drugmakers and the organizations that pay for their products. Even if the FDA were to become more lenient when it comes to proving efficacy, it's important to understand insurers and governments aren't required to pay for new treatments just because the Agency grants them approvals. New cancer therapies can cost more than $100,000 for a year of treatment, and you had better believe end payers want proof that they're not paying through the nose for a placebo.

The accord, confirmed by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston, will resolve a lawsuit against the pharmacy operator filed in 2007 by two former employees of drugmaker Organon USA Inc on behalf of the federal government and various states. CVS in a statement said the alleged conduct at issue took place before it acquired Omnicare in 2015. Omnicare neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing as part of the settlement. The lawsuit claimed that from 1999 to 2005, Omnicare and certain pharmacies it acquired sought and received kickbacks from Organon in the form of discounts in exchange for promoting the antidepressants Remeron and Remeron SolTabs. The lawsuit said that as a result, Omnicare violated the False Claims Act by submitting kickback-tainted claims to Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor and disabled, for reimbursement. The lawsuit was filed by Richard Templin and James Banigan, both of whom were former employees of Organon, which reached a related $31 million settlement in 2014. Organon, originally based in the Netherlands, was acquired in 2007 by Schering-Plough Corp, which later merged with Merck & Co Inc. Under the False Claims Act, whistleblowers can sue companies on the government's behalf to recover taxpayer money paid out based on fraudulent claims. If successful, whistleblowers receive a percentage of the recovery. While the U.S. Justice Department can intervene in such lawsuits, in this case, the U.S. government and the 28 states named in the complaint declined to intervene, leaving the ex-Organon employees to pursue it on their own. Joel Androphy, a lawyer for Templin and Banigan, called the settlement "a fair resolution for all concerned." According to settlement papers, Omnicare agreed to pay the federal government more than $12.8 million and nearly $10.2 pursuant to state settlement agreements.

The accord, confirmed by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston, will resolve a lawsuit against the pharmacy operator filed in 2007 by two former employees of drugmaker Organon USA Inc on behalf of the federal government and various states. CVS in a statement said the alleged conduct at issue took place before it acquired Omnicare in 2015. Omnicare neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing as part of the settlement. The lawsuit claimed that from 1999 to 2005, Omnicare and certain pharmacies it acquired sought and received kickbacks from Organon in the form of discounts in exchange for promoting the antidepressants Remeron and Remeron SolTabs. The lawsuit said that as a result, Omnicare violated the False Claims Act by submitting kickback-tainted claims to Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor and disabled, for reimbursement. The lawsuit was filed by Richard Templin and James Banigan, both of whom were former employees of Organon, which reached a related $31 million settlement in 2014. Organon, originally based in the Netherlands, was acquired in 2007 by Schering-Plough Corp, which later merged with Merck & Co Inc. Under the False Claims Act, whistleblowers can sue companies on the government's behalf to recover taxpayer money paid out based on fraudulent claims. If successful, whistleblowers receive a percentage of the recovery. While the U.S. Justice Department can intervene in such lawsuits, in this case, the U.S. government and the 28 states named in the complaint declined to intervene, leaving the ex-Organon employees to pursue it on their own. Joel Androphy, a lawyer for Templin and Banigan, called the settlement "a fair resolution for all concerned." According to settlement papers, Omnicare agreed to pay the federal government more than $12.8 million and nearly $10.2 pursuant to state settlement agreements. The federal government in turn has agreed to pay nearly $3.73 million to Templin and Banigan. The case is U.S. ex rel. Banigan and Templin, et al, v. Organon USA Inc, et al, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 07-cv-12153.

Peripheral neuropathy is caused due to traumatic injuries, infections, metabolic problems, inherited causes and exposure to toxins, and most commonly by diabetes mellitus. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it was estimated that there would be 285 million diabetics by 2010 in the world. This estimate is projected to increase by 65% to become 438 million in the year 2030. Thus, rising prevalence of diabetes mellitus is expected to increase the population of patients suffering from peripheral neuropathy. With a limited number of prescription drugs available for neuropathic pain, off-label prescription of several other drugs is widespread. The pharma industry has been struggling to further improve the currently available therapeutic options due to the complexity of identification of the most suitable targets for investigation. Recently, there has been a shift towards the adoption of transdermal therapies for the management of neuropathic pain. The global peripheral neuropathy market is segmented by treatment type as pharmacological therapies and non-pharmacological therapies. Pharmacological therapies includes pain killers, anti-seizures medication, antidepressants. Non pharmacological therapies include transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, plasma exchange and intravenous immune globulin and others (physical therapy and surgery). Pharmacological therapies most commonly used and dominates the peripheral neuropathy market, while non-pharmacological therapies are used along with other treatment options. In the base 2016, North America was observed as the largest market for peripheral neuropathy. The rising geriatric population, growing incidences of diabetes in the region is the prime factor driving the North America peripheral neuropathy market. Asia Pacific is anticipated to be fastest growing market for the forecast period 2017-2025. Market Competition Assessment: Key players in the global peripheral neuropathy market are Abbott Laboratories, Bristol Myers Squibb, Cipla Limited, Eli Lilly and Company, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Lupin Limited, Merck and Co. Inc., Novartis, Pfizer Inc, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Key Market Movements: Prediabetes and diabetes both are becoming a bigger problem and as a consequence more and more patients are anticipated to suffer from peripheral pain. As the prevalence of this condition persists to grow, the demand for treatment for peripheral neuropathy will also correspondingly increase. Non-pharmacologic treatments of neuropathic pain are usually begun simultaneously with pharmacologic regimen. It is reported through various studies that reference for non-pharmacologic methods for neuropathic pain management is on a perpetual rise.  Request Sample: http://www.credenceresearch.com/sample-request/58475 About: Credence Research is a worldwide market research and counseling firm that serves driving organizations, governments, non-legislative associations, and not-for-benefits.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 26 May 2017 by Persistence Market Research Antibacterial Drugs Market Will Generate New Growth Opportunities by 2020 Antibacterial drugs refer to the substances that can destroy or inhibit the growth of microorganism such as bacteria. Antibacterial drugs are often termed as antibiotics, and widely used in prevention and treatment of infectious dieses. Various classes of these drugs have been developed, according to the microorganism to be checked. Antibacterial drugs market is driven by increasing prevalence of infectious diseases. A sample of this report is available upon request @ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/2987 β-lactams have the largest market in antibacterial drugs market. Out of which, carbapenems have the fastest growing market. This is due to increased intake of this drug, replacing others. Asia dominates the antibacterial drugs market. This is due to large population base and increasing cases for bacterial infections such as tuberculosis, pneumonia, tetanus and others in the region. Countries, such as China and India, are expected to experience high growth for antibacterial drugs market. This is due to increasing availability of generic drugs and improving economy in these countries. North America and Europe are also expected to experience significant growth in antibacterial drugs market due to rising number of multi-drug resistant bacterial strains in these regions. Increase in aged population, growing demand for efficient and affordable antibacterial drugs and increasing number of multi-drug resistant bacterial strains are some of the key factors that are driving the global antibacterial drugs market. In addition, increased prevalence of infectious diseases, that demand for development of innovative molecules or treatment are driving the antibacterial drugs market. However, factors such as rising number of generic drugs for antibacterial activities and patent expiries are restraining the growth of antibacterial market. In addition, less R&D in this field and increased market maturity are restraining the global antibacterial drugs market. Innovation of some novel compounds with improved efficacy, reduced time for action and fewer side effects are expected to offer good opportunity for growth of antibacterial drugs market. Some of the major trends that have been observed in the antibacterial drugs market include partnerships between companies for new product developments. In addition, presently, only few patented drugs are available in antibacterial drugs market. The market is dominated with generic drugs manufacturers. New formulations and use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), combination products are gaining popularity in the market.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 26 May 2017 by Persistence Market Research U.S Bacterial Conjunctivitis Drugs Market to Exceed US$ 439.8 Million in 2024 End According to a new market report published by Persistence Market Research “The U.S Market Study on Bacterial Conjunctivitis Drugs: fluoroquinolones to be the Largest Segment by 2024” the bacterial conjunctivitis drugs market in the U.S. was valued at USD 473.3 million in 2013 and is estimated to reach a market worth of USD 439.8 million in 2024, at a CAGR of2.7%from 2012 to 2018 and (-3.73%) from 2018 to 2024. Conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the conjunctiva – the clear membrane that covers the outermost layer of an eye and the inner surface of eyelids. Conjunctivitis is segmented into three major categories: infective (viral and bacterial), allergic, and irritant (chemical). Bacterial conjunctivitis is one of the most commonly observed eye problems across all age groups, generally caused by bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella lacunata, Haemophilus influenza, and others (e.g. Chlamydia trachomatis, Proteus mirabilis, etc.). As reported by Healio (specialty medical news and journal publisher), approximately 5 million acute bacterial conjunctivitis cases are reported in the U.S. each year. Thus, high prevalence of bacterial conjunctivitis in the country demands effective medications, thereby driving the growth of the bacterial conjunctivitis drugs market in the U.S.However, despite the increasing incidence of bacterial conjunctivitis, the overall bacterial conjunctivitis market in the U.S. is likely to witness negative growth due to the patent expirations of major blockbuster drugs such as Vigamox, Moxeza, Zymaxid, and Besivance in the next few years. Rise in ophthalmic bacterial infections is increasing the demand for antibacterial drugs in the U.S. According to a clinical study conducted by the scientists Amir A. Azari and Neal P. Barney, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in 2013, bacterial conjunctivitis accounts for over 50% of the conjunctivitis cases in the U.S. It also quoted that the incidence of bacterial conjunctivitis was estimated to be 135 in 10,000 in a single study.These statistics indicate that the U.S. is witnessing high incidence of bacterial conjunctivitis, hence leading to increased demand for bacterial conjunctivitis drugs in the country. Fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, macrolides and other antibacterials such as bacitracin, doxycycline, and ceftriaxone collectively form the bacterial conjunctivitis market; among which fluoroquinolones dominate the bacterial conjunctivitis drugs market in the U.S. with a share of more than 70% in 2013. Fluoroquinolones are more widely prescribed as compared to other antibiotic drug classes for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis across the U.S. due to their higher efficacy against antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains and broad spectrum activity. However, the segment is expected to witness a significant decline in sales in the near future -from a CAGR of 4.9% from 2012 to 2018 to a CAGR of (-8.1%) from 2018 to 2024. Burgeoning influx of generic antibacterials as well as upcoming patent expiries of leading branded formulations such as Vigamox, Zymaxid, Moxeza, and Besivance are a few major factors that would adversely affect the growth of the segment. With the loss of patent exclusivity, generics would offer physicians a broad range of affordable medications to prescribe, thereby significantly reducing the overall size of the bacterial conjunctivitis drugs market in the U.S. Hence, the future market growth would be contingent on commercialization of novel drugs for new indications. However, it has been observed that although the incidence rate of bacterial conjunctivitis is moderate in the U.S., the risk of morbidity is less, due to which the novel product pipeline for bacterial conjunctivitis is weak/dry. At present, only a few novel compounds are under investigation in both preclinical and clinical settings for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis. A Sample of this report is available upon request @ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/5192 The U.S. bacterial conjunctivitis drugs market displays intense competitive rivalry among existing players, as currently the market is highly fragmented comprising both large and small pharmaceutical companies. Key players profiled in this study include organizations such as Actavis plc, Akorn, Inc., Bayer AG, F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Ltd., Merck & Co., Inc., Novartis AG, Perrigo Company plc, Pfizer, Inc., Santen Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 26 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Demand for Anti-Carcinogenic Drugs and Therapies in Many of the Asian Countries is Growing at a Healthy Pace which Drives the Demand for Colon Carcinoma Therapeutics Market Colon carcinoma is one of the most commonly occurring cancer type around the globe, it is usually developed in parts of the large intestine such as colon or rectum. The underlining cause of the cancer is an abnormal growth of cells in the parts of the large intestine due to certain cellular mutation. These cancer cells often lead to the growth of tumor in the respective area and are capable of invading other parts of the body. People over the age of 50 are more prone to the disease as incidence ratio is high amongst the geriatric population. Higher consumption of junked food, red meat and processed meat and lack of physical activity are linked with colon carcinoma. Health experts also suggest obesity, excessive smoking and consumption of alcohol as other factors that may cause the disease. Browse through Colon Carcinoma Therapeutics Market report to know what factors will shape the market by 2024: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/colon-carcinoma-therap… Few of the symptoms include blood in the stool, abnormal bowel movements, constipation weakness, vomiting, weight loss and nausea. At times, colon carcinoma may also root other complications such as inflammatory bowel disorders. Higher emphasis on further development of anti-carcinogenic drugs is expected to deliver some promising outcomes in the near future. Currently, colon carcinoma has four common treatment modules namely chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy and laparoscopic surgery. In the recent years, laparoscopic surgery has become more popular as the treatment is less painful delivering greater results. Increasing Incidence Rate and Higher Demand of Cancer Therapeutics is expected to drive the Global Colon Carcinoma Therapeutics Market Increasing geriatric population and changing lifestyle are the major cause of the disease. Being one of the most commonly occurring cancers, the demand for its treatment is growing at a significant rate. Further, increasing awareness and early diagnosis are expected to fuel the global colon carcinoma therapeutics market in the near future. The demand for anti-carcinogenic drugs and therapies in many of the Asian countries is growing at a healthy pace and is expected to favor the overall market. With each coming year, the number of incidences is increasing and is considered as a major factor driving the global market. On the other hand, despite increasing research and medicinal advancements, a complete cure for the disease is still not available. Biomedical researchers, scientist and health experts have seen success in extending the life expectancy of the patients, however, mortality rate still remains high in most cases. Other factors curtailing the growth of the market include high-cost of treatment, adverse side effects and credibility of drugs. Apart from these, long durations of research and heavy financial investments required for conducting preclinical research and development programs are major concerns for the pharmaceutical companies supplying colon carcinoma drugs. Most patients receiving cancer treatments are subjected to severe side effects such as weight loss, hair loss and extreme weakness. Hence, drug manufacturers are highly focusing on enhancing the conventional methods of treatment. Over the past few years, a range of novel anti-carcinogenic drugs has introduced in the market by different brands. Furthermore, advanced screening test and surgery techniques such as robotic surgery has come up and are considered beneficial for the global colon carcinoma therapeutics market in the coming years.
