português suomeksi svenska Agenus announces collaboration with the National Cancer Institute to evaluate the combination of Pembrolizumab (Keytruda®, Merck & Co., Inc.) with Prophage™ (Agenus Inc.) autologous vaccine News provided by Agenus Inc. Jan 17, 2017, 09:00 ET Share this article LEXINGTON, Mass., Jan. 17, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Agenus Inc. (NASDAQ: AGEN), an immuno-oncology company with a pipeline of immune checkpoint antibodies and cancer vaccines, today announced a clinical trial collaboration with the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The double-blind, randomized controlled Phase 2 trial will evaluate the effect of Agenus' personalized autologous vaccine candidate, Prophage™ (HSPPC-96), in conjunction with Merck's pembrolizumab on the overall survival rate of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (ndGBM). The trial will be conducted by the Brain Tumor Trials Collaborative (BTTC), a consortium of top academic centers led by Dr. Mark Gilbert, Chief of the Neuro-Oncology Branch at the NCI Center for Cancer Research. The trial aims to assess the efficacy of PD-1 targeted checkpoint blockade in combination with a heat-shock protein based vaccine candidate in an indication in which this vaccine has shown improved progression-free survival, as presented at ASCO 2015. It is a two-arm trial with one arm receiving pembrolizumab as a monotherapy and a second arm receiving both Prophage and pembrolizumab in combination. Forty-five patients will be randomly assigned to each arm. Under this collaboration, Agenus will supply Prophage™, Merck will provide pembrolizumab (Keytruda®) and NCI and BTTC member sites will recruit patients and conduct the trial. About Prophage™ Prophage is an individualized autologous vaccine candidate derived from proteins extracted from the patient's tumor. The vaccine candidate consists of heat shock protein peptide complexes that include the chaperone gp-96 (HSPPC-96) naturally bound to tumor protein fragments. Administration of HSPPC-96 bearing the precise antigenic fingerprint of the patient's particular cancer represents an effective immune education strategy that enhances recognition of a tumor as 'non-self' leading to a potent anti-tumor immune response. In a Phase 2 study of Prophage monotherapy, patients with ndGBM exhibited an improved progression-free and overall survival as compared to historical control with standard of care. About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that works by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.  KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma; for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression (TPS ≥50%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations and upon disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC whose tumors express PD- L1 (TPS ≥1); and for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy.  KEYTRUDA is administered as an intravenous infusion every three weeks for the approved indications. For Safety and Prescribing Information for KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab), please see  http://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/k/keytruda/keytruda_pi.pdf   About Agenus Agenus is a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company focused on the discovery and development of novel therapies that engage the body's immune system to fight cancer.

"Our new facility was optimized around the manufacturing process to achieve greater efficiencies and meets the most stringent quality standards for manufacturing meglumine," said Andrew Bulpin, Head of Process Solutions Strategic Marketing & Innovation, Life Science.  "The result is a high level of confidence in quality and security of supply for our customers."

Under the terms of the deal, Merck will use Palantir's advanced data analytics capabilities to "more rapidly develop and deliver medicines and commercialize new products to achieve better patient outcomes". "Biomedical research generates unprecedented volumes of rapidly evolving data every day," said Merck in a statement. "But accessing, learning from, and expanding on those assets has become a huge bottleneck in scientists' ability to bring new innovations from the bench to the bedside." Merck will work with Palantir on cancer therapies in the first instance, with the aim of developing a collaborative data and analytics platform for the drug development processes that will give researchers new understanding of how new medicines work. Palantir contends that many scientists in pharma companies struggle with unstructured data and information silos that "reduce creativity and limit researchers' corrective analyses". The data analytics and sharing platform will help Merck researchers analyse real-world and bioinformatics data so they can "understand the patients who may benefit most" from a treatment. The alliance also has a patient-centric component, and according to Merck will improve the experience of patients using its products, improve adherence as well as provide feedback on real-world efficacy. Finally, the two companies will collaborate on a platform that will allow improved global supply chain forecasting and help to get medicines to patients who need them around the world as quickly as possible. Neither company has disclosed any financial details on the deal. Merck has made digital a core part of its strategy in healthcare, setting up incubator schemes in Germany, the US and Africa to seek out and fund promising start-up projects. In addition to the new Palantir collaboration, Merck has signed a deal with Stanford Graduate School of Business, allowing Merck executives to tap into the academic centre's expertise with training on innovation and digitalisation. The latest agreements come shortly after Merck signed a licensing agreement with Vertex Pharmaceuticals giving it rights to four cancer candidates in return for an upfront payment of $230m.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Saturday January 28, 2017 News Business Larger / SmallerNight Mode Collateral damage a risk from Bionomics board row Brian Robins 26 Mar 2016, 12:15 a.m. Dissdent shareholders, directors on the backfoot and a chief executive with a lot of sway. Collateral damage a risk from Bionomics board row Bionomics chief executive Deborah Rathjen is caught up in the board room brawl. Photo: Luis Enrique Ascui Bionomics chairman Graeme Kaufman is looking over his shoulder. Photo: Arsineh Houspian Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit Biotechnology is the one section of the ASX where women have broken through the glass ceiling, with a large number of female chief executives in the sector. And of all the women running successful biotech outfits, Deborah Rathjen is the most experienced. She has been chief executive of Bionomics since 2000, having been appointed to the position just months after it went public. She cut her teeth successfully fighting a patent claim against German giant BASF for a compound that helped develop the arthritis treatment drug Humira. Now she is caught up in a bitter fight with shareholders, after they slapped down her board earlier in March by blocking the issue of warrants to US investors that formed part of a deeply unpopular $US12 million discounted placement in December. CVC, a 5 per cent shareholder in Bionomics, is seeking now to axe two board members, with chairman Graeme Kaufman and Trevor Tappenden in its sights. Other investors, such as Platinum International's healthcare fund and Ausbil, are more circumspect, supporting the board renewal but preferring a more measured approach. For a company worth $150 million on a good day, the damage to Bionomics' reputation from the board fight will be deep and long lasting, and highlights the downside of investing in biotech stocks, where there is the need to get research runs on the board, as well as ensure sharemarket valuations are sustained. But research takes time. "Ten years in biotechnology is nothing," one global investor said of the sector. "The assets are good, the technology is good but Bionomics has shown it doesn't understand how to look after shareholders," one disaffected shareholder said. "It is one thing to have a good company but you can be undone by how you use – and raise – capital. "It has been going sideways for many years. The December raising says a lot about how it has failed its shareholders." While there is support for board change, there is concern that losing the chief executive could be collateral damage. "There is the need to ensure management is not rattled," Ausbil's equities head Paul Xiradis, who has a 5.7 per cent stake, said. "I'm all for change at the board," said Bianca Ogden, who runs Platinum International's healthcare fund and is anxious for the board to find someone with international drug development experience to join. "I would be very worried about losing Deborah Rathjen." At issue is the close relationship with global pharmaceutical giant Merck, which took shares in Bionomics in 2015, and which is partnering with Bionomics in two drug development programs that could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Bionomics if they succeed. "Establishing strong long-term external collaborations is central to our business development strategy," Dr Iain Dukes, senior vice-president business development and licensing at Merck Research Laboratories, said. "We have been impressed with the progress made by Bionomics to date on both our cognition and pain programs and look forward to advancing these programs further." Dr Rathjen's success in duchessing Merck, which she has brought on to the share register, has put her in a powerful position, which might also have created some of the board room imbalance. "Where you have such a longstanding chief executive, then the board is largely created by and influenced by the chief executive. It now needs to demonstrate it has good, strong new directors not chosen by the chief executive," the dissident shareholder said. Standing alongside CVC in agitating for change is one of the country's richest businessmen, Laurence Freedman, the former fund manager who has been a Bionomics shareholder for 17 years. Best known these days for supporting animal rights, he studied science at university before falling into the finance sector, after arriving in Australia with $100. "I probably have $150 I my pocket now," he says. He says he has regularly sought to engage with Bionomics' board of directors but has been rebuffed, even though he has a 7 per cent holding. "Bionomics is chronically undervalued – it's never been near its deemed value,'' he says, criticising the board for its lack of "skin in the game". "I came here with nothing. To achieve what I've achieved, yet I'm not competent to become a single board member, when I'm the largest shareholder . . . I'd like a rational answer." He has withstood pressure to go on the Bionomics board previously and is deeply uncertain about putting himself forward this time. Equally, a deal could be patched up to avoid the public brawling before it goes to shareholders for a vote. "We would like to see this resolved without going to an EGM," Sandy Beard, of CVC, said. Venture capital investor George Jessup, who at one point a few years ago controlled more than a fifth of the capital, said: "If they brought in two new directors who understood shareholder value, then I'd be interested in investing in the company on a personal basis."

Hopkins Published 2:40 pm, Tuesday, January 17, 2017 President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Food and Drug Administration should have a medical background, and the agency should continue evaluating new medications’ effectiveness, drugmaker executives said in comments indicating opposition to two candidates for the regulator’s top post. Trump’s FDA chief should be a doctor or physician-scientist with experience in clinical care and medical research, said Roger Perlmutter, head of research and development for Merck & Co. The president-elect is reportedly considering appointing former biotechnology industry executive Balaji Srinivasan and Jim O’Neill, a Silicon Valley investor. Neither has a medical background, and O’Neill has suggested that the FDA should focus solely on new drugs’ safety, leaving the market to decide whether they work. “We’d want someone in that position who is knowledgeable about drug development or patient care,” Perlmutter said in an interview at the recent J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. “We wouldn’t want somebody in there who didn’t have that level of understanding, but they could come from a lot of different environments,” such as public health, he said. Trump will be sworn in Friday, and big pharma companies are closely watching his administration’s appointments as he continues to roil the industry, telling the Washington Post on Sunday that he will continue to focus on high drug prices. Srinivasan and O’Neill, both associates of venture capitalist Peter Thiel, who’s advising Trump on science and technology, have criticized the FDA on Twitter and in speeches. Representatives of the Trump transition team didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Srinivasan, whose 21 Inc. startup got funding from Thiel, also co-founded Counsyl Inc., which makes a pregnancy test to quickly detect Down syndrome and other severe, chromosome-related birth defects. He is no longer with the company, Counsyl said. Srinivasan has been a critic of government in general and of the FDA in particular. His posts to Twitter attacking the agency have been deleted since his consideration became public last week. In an Aug. 13 tweet that’s been removed, he wrote, “FDA bears responsibility for many deaths. Blocked many good drugs.” O’Neill, a managing director at Thiel’s Mithril Capital Management, served in George W. Bush’s administration as principal associate deputy secretary in the Department of Health and Human Services. Allowing the FDA to approve drugs based only on safety, as O’Neill has suggested, would be a setback for the agency and for health, Ovid Therapeutics CEO Jeremy Levin said. One of the FDA’s most important functions is determining whether drugs work, he said. “If there is any attempt to change the mission of the FDA — in other words, to prove both safety and efficacy — then America’s primacy in drug discoveries will suffer,” Levin said. “Any person who comes to run it needs to understand the value of clinical trials, the value of not just proving safety, but proving efficacy.” Takeda Pharmaceutical will continue developing drugs with the expectation that the FDA won’t change its mission, said Ramona Sequeira, president of U.S. operations for the Japanese drugmaker. “We spend a lot of time testing both the efficacy and safety of our drugs and have a full expectation to demonstrate both,” she said in an interview. Limiting FDA’s purview to drug safety is worth exploring, said Mark Baum, CEO of Imprimis Pharmaceuticals in San Diego, which makes compounded drugs. Insurers, the gatekeepers for much of patient care, already monitor drug efficacy, he said. “There is some wisdom in thinking about whether we want the FDA in the efficacy business at all,” he said. Appointing either Srinivasan or O’Neill to head the agency would be a significant departure from tradition. For decades, trained physicians or prominent scientific researchers have overseen the FDA, widely considered the final word on safety of drugs for human health. The current head, cardiologist Robert Califf, was a founding director of the Duke Clinical Research Institute. Jared S. Hopkins is a Bloomberg writer.

Trump’s FDA chief should be a doctor or physician-scientist with experience in clinical care and medical research, said Roger Perlmutter, head of research and development for Merck & Co. The president-elect is considering appointing former biotechnology industry executive Balaji Srinivasan and Jim O’Neill, a Silicon Valley investor, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Neither has a medical background, and O’Neill has suggested that the FDA should focus solely on new drugs’ safety, leaving the market to decide whether they work. “We’d want someone in that position who is knowledgeable about drug development or patient care,” Perlmutter said Jan. 9 in an interview at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. “We wouldn’t want somebody in there who didn’t have that level of understanding, but they could come from a lot of different environments,” such as public health, he said.

Srinivasan and O’Neill, both associates of venture capitalist Peter Thiel, who’s advising Trump on science and technology, have criticized the FDA on Twitter and in speeches. Representatives of the Trump transition team didn’t immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment. Agency Critic Srinivasan, whose 21 Inc. startup got funding from Thiel, earlier co-founded Counsyl Inc., which makes a pregnancy test to quickly detect Down syndrome and other severe, chromosome-related birth defects. He is no longer with the company, Counsyl said. Srinivasan has been a critic of government in general and of the FDA in particular. His posts to Twitter attacking the agency have been deleted since his consideration became public last week. In an Aug. 13 tweet that’s been removed, he wrote, “FDA bears responsibility for many deaths. Blocked many good drugs.” O’Neill, a managing director at Thiel’s Mithril Capital Management, served in George W. Bush’s administration as principal associate deputy secretary in the Department of Health and Human Services. Allowing the FDA to approve drugs based only on safety, as O’Neill has suggested, would be a setback for the agency and for health, Ovid Therapeutics Inc. Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Levin said in an interview. One of the FDA’s most important functions is determining whether drugs work, he said. Insurer Oversight “If there is any attempt to change the mission of the FDA -- in other words, to prove both safety and efficacy -- then America’s primacy in drug discoveries will suffer,” Levin said. “Any person who comes to run it needs to understand the value of clinical trials, the value of not just proving safety, but proving efficacy.” Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. will continue developing drugs with the expectation that the FDA won’t change its mission, said Ramona Sequeira, president of U.S. operations for the Japanese drugmaker. “We spend a lot of time testing both the efficacy and safety of our drugs and have a full expectation to demonstrate both,” she said in an interview.

Appointing either Srinivasan or O’Neill to head the agency would be a significant departure from tradition. For decades, trained physicians or prominent scientific researchers have overseen the FDA, widely considered the final word on safety of drugs for human health. The current head, cardiologist Robert Califf, was a founding director of the Duke Clinical Research Institute. Scott Gottlieb, a physician who’s a former senior official at the FDA and a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, is also said to be under consideration.

article BRUSSELS, January 17, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Brexit, healthcare management, EU R&D planning and other hot-button topics drive expansion of Brussels-based innovation network to more than 50 members from 17 countries  Rising demand for cross-border cooperation in science and technology is driving a rapid expansion of the Science|Business Network of universities, companies and innovation agencies - with membership passing 50 organisations. During 2016, 15 new organisations - from France, the Netherlands, Finland, Spain, the US, Switzerland and South Africa - joined the Network, pushing the total number of members and partners to 52. This growth reflects an increasing interest, despite today's many political and economic uncertainties, in finding better ways to connect across borders for collaboration in research and innovation, and in the development of policies that affect it. "There may be fears of global conflict in some quarters, but at least in the area of science and technology we see more, not less, desire to find partners across borders," said Maryline Fiaschi, managing director of Science|Business. That's reflected in the addition during 2016 of new members and partners including Université Aix-Marseille, the University of Amsterdam, Amgen, Novartis, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Finnish innovation agency Tekes, the Eureka Secretariat, the University of Eastern Finland, the South African Department of Science & Technology, and the Barcelona Supercomputing Center. The Network, a membership organisation focused on research and innovation based in Brussels, organises private and public meetings, reports and strategies for members. Said Naledie Pandor, minister of science and technology for the Republic of South Africa: "International cooperation in science and technology is a strategic imperative for South Africa. We have therefore developed a vibrant and diverse portfolio of partnerships, which enables us to share in international expertise and experience, and importantly contribute our resources as part of a global response to our shared societal challenges. "In this context we value our strategic cooperation with Science|Business as it permits the deepening and expansion of especially our European ties. We are determined to put global innovation partnerships at the service of our society and continent, and cooperation with Science|Business is a valuable resource for this mission." Yvon Berland, president of another new member, top-rated Université Aix-Marseille, said: "When we decided to become a member of the Science|Business Network, I considered its two main assets: first, it's the only place where universities and industries, at that level, can collaborate on both research and innovation policies and actions. That's essential for Aix-Marseille University, and for all of us. Second, no other network allows us to conduct substantive long-term projects and at the same time to react very quickly to news". Another new member, US biotech giant Amgen, became a founding partner of Science|Business' new platform for health policy, Healthy Measures. Corinne Le Goff, senior vice president, Amgen Europe, said: "In an era of healthcare reform in Europe, Amgen is committed to act as a partner in the healthcare system by providing value-based healthcare (VBHC) solutions. VBHC solutions that are truly patient-centric - integrated across the patient care pathway and personalized to patient conditions, circumstances and preferences - and valuable in the real world, proven through evidence generation, with the aim to enhance health delivery across Europe. We have joined the Science|Business Healthy Measures multi-stakeholder communications platform as we believe that sustainable healthcare systems across Europe will need strong collaboration among trusted partners and key stakeholders." About Science|Business:  The Science|Business Network, founded in 2004 by three prominent European science and technology journalists, brings leaders in academia, industry and policy together for regular private and public meetings to debate policy, share intelligence, and develop recommendations to government. It also publishes a regular newsletter on EU research and innovation policy, which today marked its 500th edition. A special focus of the group during 2017 is planning for the European Union's next Framework Programme for research and innovation; the impact of Brexit on science and education; and the development of open data and cloud computing services for researchers. In addition, the group launched a specialised platform on 8 November 2016 to improve the quality of healthcare around Europe by better use of patient data. Other topics to be covered by the Network during 2017 include R&D into military, maritime and industrial technologies, and the bioeconomy. http://www.sciencebusiness.net SOURCE Science|Business Publishing Ltd Dec 01, 2015, 03:59 ET Preview: The Barcelona Climate Declaration My News Release contains wide tables.

During 2016, 15 new organisations - from France, the Netherlands, Finland, Spain, the US, Switzerland and South Africa - joined the Network, pushing the total number of members and partners to 52. This growth reflects an increasing interest, despite today's many political and economic uncertainties, in finding better ways to connect across borders for collaboration in research and innovation, and in the development of policies that affect it. "There may be fears of global conflict in some quarters, but at least in the area of science and technology we see more, not less, desire to find partners across borders," said Maryline Fiaschi, managing director of Science|Business. That's reflected in the addition during 2016 of new members and partners including Université Aix-Marseille, the University of Amsterdam, Amgen, Novartis, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Finnish innovation agency Tekes, the Eureka Secretariat, the University of Eastern Finland, the South African Department of Science & Technology, and the Barcelona Supercomputing Center. The Network, a membership organisation focused on research and innovation based in Brussels, organises private and public meetings, reports and strategies for members. Said Naledie Pandor, minister of science and technology for the Republic of South Africa: "International cooperation in science and technology is a strategic imperative for South Africa. We have therefore developed a vibrant and diverse portfolio of partnerships, which enables us to share in international expertise and experience, and importantly contribute our resources as part of a global response to our shared societal challenges. "In this context we value our strategic cooperation with Science|Business as it permits the deepening and expansion of especially our European ties. We are determined to put global innovation partnerships at the service of our society and continent, and cooperation with Science|Business is a valuable resource for this mission." Yvon Berland, president of another new member, top-rated Université Aix-Marseille, said: "When we decided to become a member of the Science|Business Network, I considered its two main assets: first, it's the only place where universities and industries, at that level, can collaborate on both research and innovation policies and actions. That's essential for Aix-Marseille University, and for all of us. Second, no other network allows us to conduct substantive long-term projects and at the same time to react very quickly to news". Another new member, US biotech giant Amgen, became a founding partner of Science|Business' new platform for health policy, Healthy Measures. Corinne Le Goff, senior vice president, Amgen Europe, said: "In an era of healthcare reform in Europe, Amgen is committed to act as a partner in the healthcare system by providing value-based healthcare (VBHC) solutions. VBHC solutions that are truly patient-centric - integrated across the patient care pathway and personalized to patient conditions, circumstances and preferences - and valuable in the real world, proven through evidence generation, with the aim to enhance health delivery across Europe. We have joined the Science|Business Healthy Measures multi-stakeholder communications platform as we believe that sustainable healthcare systems across Europe will need strong collaboration among trusted partners and key stakeholders." About Science|Business:  The Science|Business Network, founded in 2004 by three prominent European science and technology journalists, brings leaders in academia, industry and policy together for regular private and public meetings to debate policy, share intelligence, and develop recommendations to government. It also publishes a regular newsletter on EU research and innovation policy, which today marked its 500th edition. A special focus of the group during 2017 is planning for the European Union's next Framework Programme for research and innovation; the impact of Brexit on science and education; and the development of open data and cloud computing services for researchers. In addition, the group launched a specialised platform on 8 November 2016 to improve the quality of healthcare around Europe by better use of patient data. Other topics to be covered by the Network during 2017 include R&D into military, maritime and industrial technologies, and the bioeconomy. http://www.sciencebusiness.net SOURCE Science|Business Publishing Ltd Journalists and Bloggers Visit PR Newswire for Journalists for releases, photos and customised feeds just for media.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Global Monoclonal Antibody Therapeutics Market: Spike in Cancer Cases Around the World to Ensure Swift Uptake, Predicts TMR Global Monoclonal Antibody Therapeutics Market: Spike in Cancer Cases Around the World to Ensure Swift Uptake, Predicts TMR Posted on January 16, 2017 by ReleaseWire - Latest Press Releases in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer Albany, NY — (SBWIRE) — 01/16/2017 — Several market players are collaborating with local and well-established companies and research facilities to strengthen their position. Transparency Market Research has observed that companies will continue to partner in order to reduce the high cost involved in the production of monoclonal antibodies, investments in research and development, and need for trained staff. Some of the leading players operating in the demanding global market are Bayer AG, Pfizer Inc., Sanofi, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Merck & Co., Inc., GlaxoSmithKline Plc., Novartis AG, and AbbVie Inc. The extensive research report by Transparency Market Research states that the global monoclonal antibody therapeutics market will be worth US$245.8 bn by 2024 from US$86.7 bn in 2015. During the forecast years of 2016 and 2024, the global market is expected to rise at a CAGR of 12.6%. Access to Affordable Healthcare across North America Amplifies Demand for Monoclonal Antibody Therapeutics View Full Report at: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/monoclonal-antibody-therapeutics-market.html Monoclonal antibody therapeutics are used for treating cancer, autoimmune diseases, infection, ophthalmological diseases, and hematological diseases among others. Of these, the autoimmune diseases segment is projected to rise at a phenomenal pace during the forecast period. Increasing incidence of autoimmune diseases that affect the overall population has triggered a significant demand for these therapeutics. All throughout the forecast period of 2016 and 2024, the global market is expected to rise at a CAGR of 13.5%. In terms of geography, the global market is segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East and Africa. Regionally, North America is expected to dominate the global market due to growing healthcare facilities across the region. Furthermore, affordable healthcare available to patients has also augmented the demand for monoclonal antibody therapeutics across North America during the forecast period. By the end of 2024, the North America monoclonal antibody therapeutics market is expected to acquire a share of 37.9% in the global market. Approvals and Commercialization of New Products Ups Sales The global monoclonal antibody therapeutics market is expected to grow at a remarkable pace due to the high incidence of chronic diseases like cancer. The growing health concerns and the increasing diagnoses of cancer in various stages as boosted the demand for these therapeutics in recent years. The latest research by the World Health Organization predicts that the world will witness a 70% spike in the overall cancer cases, of which 60% of the cases will be attributable to Latin America, Asia, and Africa. The incremental approvals in monoclonal antibody products across Europe and the U.S. have also contributed to soaring revenue of the global market. The report by TMR suggests that about five to six monoclonal antibodies are approved each year in these regions. Out of the 60 monoclonal antibodies approved in Europe in 2015, 48 have hit the market. Thus, the widening product portfolio that comes in a broad price range has also played a key role in encouraging the uptake of monoclonal antibody therapeutics. High Cost of Production Dissuades Market Growth Though the market is estimated to have a bright potential, it is likely to be shadowed by a few restraints. The increasing production of biosimilars that are also used for treating various chronic conditions and autoimmune diseases are expected to eat into the market share of monoclonal antibody therapeutics market. Furthermore, the patent cliff of several products is also likely to have a negative impact on the overall earnings of the global market. The market is also anticipated to face a tough challenge due to the high cost of monoclonal antibodies as their production is exceptionally time-consuming and demands strict adherence to rules and regulations. This review is based on Transparency Market Research's report, titled "Monoclonal Antibody Therapeutics Market – Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Volume, Growth, Trends, and Forecast, 2016 – 2024."

The logo of the World Economic Forum adorns the facade of the organization’s headquarters in Cologny near Geneva in this Jan. 10 photo. -- AFP    RELATED STORIES EITI harnessed to ensure compliance in use of environmental, social development funds Dev’t plan to address brain drain, reliance on worker remittances Claver downplays accusations vs Pichay Growth in total exports could top 7% by 2018 Corn sector lobbying for agency to regulate industry, aid farmers The report, released on Monday by the Business and Sustainable Development Commission, said that pressure on business to become a “responsible social actor” was likely to grow. The group was launched at the Davos 2016 World Economic Forum here to encourage businesses to take the lead in poverty reduction and sustainable development. Members include the chief executives of multinational firms such as Edelman, Pearson, Investec, Merck, Safaricom, Abraaj, Alibaba and Aviva, alongside academics, environmentalists, trade union leaders and philanthropists. The study said businesses have a key role to play in achieving the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) to end poverty and protect the planet. “Achieving the global goals opens up an economic prize of at least $12 trillion by 2030 for the private sector and potentially two to three times more,” the study said, adding this could be achieved by action in just four areas, namely: energy, cities, agriculture and health. The $12 trillion -- made up of business savings and revenue gains -- would be equal to a tenth of forecast global economic output while 90% of the new jobs would be in the developing world, the study said. Mark Malloch-Brown, chair of the Commission, said the opportunities included measures to cut greenhouse gas emissions even though US President-elect Donald Trump has sometimes dismissed man-made climate change as a hoax. “In many cases the horse has already left the stable,” he told Reuters of a shift to a greener economy under way in many parts of the world, driven by concern over rising temperatures and by falling prices for renewable energies. Progress has been slow, however, and the study said businesses are still balking at longer-term investments, preferring instead to sit on cash or return it to shareholders via buybacks and dividends. The 17 SDGs, adopted in September 2015, include targets on such issues as climate, clean water, gender equality and economic inequality. The last of these has grabbed attention in recent years, bringing to prominence populist and nationalist politicians, especially in the West, as anger has grown over stagnant wages, migration, high chief executive officer salaries and corporate tax evasion. “We anticipate much greater pressure on business to prove itself a responsible social actor, creating good, properly paid jobs in its supply chains as well as in its factories and offices,” the report said, adding that paying taxes transparently was key to rebuilding social contract. Other steps it urged include pricing pollution via carbon trading and reducing food waste, a step that by itself could be worth up to $405 billion. The cost of achieving these goals by 2030 will likely require $2.4 trillion of additional annual investment, however, especially in infrastructure, the study reported. The group recommended “innovative financing” from public and private sector sources to raise this amount, adding: “The global finance system needs to become much better at deploying the trillions of dollars of savings into the sustainable investments that... the world needs.” -- Reuters E-mail | Print |     From / email :     To :     E-mail (required) :     Message :     Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.    MORE STORIES Twin foreign policy developments seen favoring Philippines Economy grows fastest in three years January inflation could pick up even more -- BSP Businesses grapple with impact of weaker peso PHL corruption perception stagnates Third-quarter 2016 GDP growth scaled down Trump withdrawal from Asia trade deal a boon for China PPP gains ground with airport offer Asia-Pacific economies try to salvage deal after Trump yanks US from TPP PHL ahead in ASEAN bank sector integration -- Fitch    MOST READ    MOST E-MAILED 1.

REUTERS/Murad Sezer/File Photo By Sujata Rao | DAVOS, Switzerland DAVOS, Switzerland Companies could unlock at least $12 trillion in market opportunities by 2030 and create up to 380 million jobs by implementing a few key development goals, according to a study by a group including global business and finance leaders. The report, released on Monday by the Business and Sustainable Development Commission, said pressure on business to become a "responsible social actor" was likely to grow. The group was launched at the Davos 2016 World Economic Forum to encourage businesses to take the lead in poverty reduction and sustainable development. Members include the chief executives of multinational firms such as Edelman, Pearson, Investec, Merck, Safaricom, Abraaj, Alibaba and Aviva, alongside academics, environmentalists, trade union leaders and philanthropists. The study said businesses have a key role to play in achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) to end poverty and protect the planet. "Achieving the global goals opens up an economic prize of at least $12 trillion by 2030 for the private sector and potentially 2-3 times more," the study said, adding this could be achieved by action in just four areas - energy, cities, agriculture and health. The $12 trillion - made up of business savings and revenue gains - would be equal to a tenth of forecast global economic output while 90 percent of the new jobs would be in the developing world, the study said. Mark Malloch-Brown, chair of the Commission, said the opportunities included measures to cut greenhouse gas emissions even though U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has sometimes dismissed man-made climate change as a hoax. "In many cases the horse has already left the stable," he told Reuters of a shift to a greener economy under way in many parts of the world, driven by concern over rising temperatures and by falling prices for renewable energies. Progress has been slow, however, and the study said businesses are still balking at longer-term investments, preferring instead to sit on cash or return it to shareholders via buybacks and dividends. The 17 SDGs, adopted in September 2015, include targets on such issues as climate, clean water, gender equality and economic inequality. The last of these has grabbed attention in recent years, bringing to prominence populist and nationalist politicians, especially in the West, as anger has grown over stagnant wages, migration, high CEO salaries and corporate tax evasion. "We anticipate much greater pressure on business to prove itself a responsible social actor, creating good, properly paid jobs in its supply chains as well as in its factories and offices," the report said, adding that paying taxes transparently was key to rebuilding social contract. Other steps it urged include pricing pollution via carbon trading and reducing food waste, a step that by itself could be worth up to $405 billion. The cost of achieving these goals by 2030 will likely require $2.4 trillion of additional annual investment, however, especially in infrastructure, the study found. The group recommended "innovative financing" from public and private sector sources to raise this amount, adding: "The global finance system needs to become much better at deploying the trillions of dollars of savings into the sustainable investments that ... the world needs."

The report, released on Monday by the Business and Sustainable Development Commission, said pressure on business to become a "responsible social actor" was likely to grow. The group was launched at the Davos 2016 World Economic Forum to encourage businesses to take the lead in poverty reduction and sustainable development. Members include the chief executives of multinational firms such as Edelman, Pearson, Investec, Merck, Safaricom, Abraaj, Alibaba and Aviva, alongside academics, environmentalists, trade union leaders and philanthropists. The study said businesses have a key role to play in achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) to end poverty and protect the planet. "Achieving the global goals opens up an economic prize of at least $12 trillion by 2030 for the private sector and potentially 2-3 times more," the study said, adding this could be achieved by action in just four areas - energy, cities, agriculture and health. The $12 trillion - made up of business savings and revenue gains - would be equal to a tenth of forecast global economic output while 90 percent of the new jobs would be in the developing world, the study said. Progress has been slow, however, and the study said businesses are still balking at longer-term investments, preferring instead to sit on cash or return it to shareholders via buybacks and dividends. The 17 SDGs, adopted in September 2015, include targets on such issues as climate, clean water, gender equality and economic inequality. The last of these has grabbed attention in recent years, bringing to prominence populist and nationalist politicians, especially in the West, as anger has grown over stagnant wages, migration, high CEO salaries and corporate tax evasion. "We anticipate much greater pressure on business to prove itself a responsible social actor, creating good, properly paid jobs in its supply chains as well as in its factories and offices," the report said, adding that paying taxes transparently was key to rebuilding social contract. Other steps it urged include pricing pollution via carbon trading and reducing food waste, a step that by itelf could be worth up to $405 billion. The cost of achieving these goals by 2030 will likely require $2.4 trillion of additional annual investment, however, especially in infrastructure, the study found. The group recommended "innovative financing" from public and private sector sources to raise this amount, adding: "The global finance system needs to become much better at deploying the trillions of dollars of savings into the sustainable investments that ... the world needs."

The cost of achieving these goals by 2030 will likely require $2.4 trillion of additional annual investment, however, especially in infrastructure, the study found. The group recommended "innovative financing" from public and private sector sources to raise this amount, adding: "The global finance system needs to become much better at deploying the trillions of dollars of savings into the sustainable investments that ... the world needs."

Centers Jan 17, 2017, 14:52 ET Share this article ROCKVILLE, Md., Jan. 17, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- While momentum around immunotherapies for cancer continues to build, the high cost of these therapies places them at the center of debate about how best to define and measure value in cancer care. As these therapies are increasingly integrated into practice, all stakeholders—providers, patients, payers, and manufacturers—need to keep pace with emerging developments and real-world challenges. A new white paper from the Association of Community Cancer Centers (ACCC) Institute for Clinical Immuno-Oncology (ICLIO) highlights immunotherapy research from 2016, emerging policy issues and challenges that may impact the future of immuno-oncology in practice, and ICLIO resources to support the multidisciplinary cancer care team in delivering immunotherapies for cancer. The white paper, Immuno-Oncology: There's More to Discover, spotlights top-level concerns for the future of immunotherapy in practice, including: Payer and coverage policies continue to pose barriers to access to immunotherapies for cancer. Thus, providers in the community have an ongoing need for education and strategies to effectively address prior authorization requirements, claims denials, and expanded access to clinical trials. Patients are driving discussions about expanded access to immunotherapies. Direct-to-consumer and other media advertising is fueling interest in immunotherapies. At the same time, this consumer interest is requiring ongoing education so that consumers understand the patient populations for whom these therapies are appropriate and to ensure that both providers and patients are equipped to discuss the benefits and risks of a particular immunotherapy. Recognition and management of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) continue to create additional expense and resource requirements across the continuum of care. Community providers are likely to see increasing challenges in this area as new indications and new combination therapies are approved by the FDA. Education on how to leverage operational assets and marshal resources to adequately recognize and manage irAEs will continue to be important. Alternative payment models (APMs) focused on value-based reimbursement must include input and buy-in from the oncology community. There is concern that APMs could be developed without oncologist input, peer review, or evidence concerning immunotherapies for cancer. Ultimately, APMs will need to create and utilize quality measures that promote innovation rather than simply drive down costs, because it is often challenging to identify what a therapy's value is until providers use it in a real-world context. As immunotherapy for cancer continues to evolve, clinical, administrative, and infrastructural operations education is increasingly important. Immuno-Oncology: There's More to Discover describes the robust support and resources ICLIO offers to meet these educational needs. ICLIO is uniquely positioned as the sole provider of comprehensive education dedicated to empowering and preparing multidisciplinary cancer care teams in the community for immuno-oncology.

The large share of this segment can be attributed to the increasing number of FDA approvals for new molecular entities, higher price commanded by innovative APIs as compared to their generic equivalents, and growing focus of innovator APIs companies on R&D for the development of novel innovative APIs products to cater to the previously unmet medical needs of the market On the basis of type of manufacturer, the APIs market is segmented into captive and merchant manufacturers. The captive manufacturers segment is estimated to account for the largest share in 2016. The large share of this segment can be can be attributed to the growing preference of companies to maintain in-house manufacturing of innovative APIs for their economic benefits. On the basis of type of synthesis the, the APIs market is categorized into synthetic and biotech APIs. The synthetic APIs segment is estimated to command the largest in 2016. The emergence of new molecules in the market, increasing number of new product approvals, and technological advancements in the method of synthesis are major factors contributing to the growth of the synthetic APIs segment. However, the biotech APIs segment is expected to grow at the highest CAGR in the forecast period. The APIs market, on the basis of type of drug, is segmented into prescription drugs and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. In 2016, the prescription drugs segment is estimated to account for the largest share of the APIs market. The large share of this segment can primarily be attributed to the increasing demand for these drugs owing to the growing incidence of diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disorders. The APIs market, on the basis of therapeutic applications, is segmented into oncology, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, endocrinology, central nervous system (CNS) and neurological disorders, and other therapeutic applications. The oncology segment is estimated to account for the largest of the global active pharmaceutical ingredients market in 2016.

Biotech Oncology, rare diseases and too little genomic diversity: 3 themes from #JPM17 By Juliet Preston Post a comment / Jan 17, 2017 at 10:41 AM Shares18 As always, the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference played host to wider debates about the health and direction of the life sciences in 2017. Drug pricing was part of the discussion (Trump made his splash mid-week). Gender diversity came to the fore in 2016 and made headways at this year’s event. Beyond the conference agenda and the breaking news, however, three underground themes were playing out at Bioweek. Genomic diversity In back-to-back sessions, the issue of ethnic diversity in genomic research came to the fore. The original human genome was caucasian and that set the tone for the millions of genomes that have been sequenced since. For a multitude of reasons, nearly all large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have followed white populations. A seminal 2009 study found 96 percent of GWAS participants were of European descent. Pacific Biosciences President and CEO Michael Hunkapiller raised the issue as he spoke about the overall progress of the genomics space and the path to understanding more about structural variants — long stretches of DNA that have been altered, as opposed to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). At the diagnostics panel, executive director of the Center for Clinical Effectiveness at Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, Suzanne Belinson, highlighted diversity as part of the challenge healthcare companies now face interpreting and bringing meaning to the information generated through sequencing and diagnostics. To me the most exciting activities that have happened over the last year are some of the collaborations around data. It requires a tremendous amount of data to solve the puzzles that we are all trying to solve. It takes a tremendous amount of data from a diverse population. The majority of the data that we have now to answer some of our genetic questions come from a very homogenous population and if we want to actually solve these problems for the diverse population in which we live, it requires a large and diverse set of data. I’m really excited about some of the organizations and health systems that are coming together to collect that data. Over-incentivizing rare disease research? The Orphan Drug Act was passed in 1983 to make the economics of rare disease research more favorable for drug companies to pursue. It has had a major impact. According to a 2014 Evaluate Pharma report, just 38 rare diseases had approved therapies when the act was passed. By 2014, the number had jumped to 373. That’s an undeniably positive shift and there are many orphan diseases that still need treatments. But at what point do we factor in the global burden of disease? Several attendees that I spoke with were grappling with the issue, including Michael Narachi of San Diego, California-based Orexigen. Against all odds, Orexigen managed to get a weight loss drug approved as a small- to mid-sized biotech. The scale and cost of clinical trials in major conditions typically require the involvement of Big Pharma. Narachi said many of his colleagues in the industry are now actively targeting niche subpopulations within a disease. It increases the odds of getting an approval and paves the way for more streamlined clinical trials. The downside for everyone is that the company then has to charge six-figure sums for the therapy to offset the small market size. And a limited number of people benefit. The age of the blockbuster drug is over. Will there be some intermediate solution found? Or will personalized medicine continue to drive expensive therapies for targeted groups? The J.P. Morgan oncology conference Oncology increasingly dominates biopharma and healthcare discussions. Annual spending on oncology drugs surged 11.5 percent to $107 billion in 2015, according to a report by the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics. The report identified 500 companies actively pursuing a combined 600 late-stage investigational oncology drugs, suggesting the growth will continue in the coming years. The oncology emphasis carried through to the agenda at J.P. Morgan, drawing crowds to CAR-T presentations and those by major pharma companies such as Merck, which is playing a large-scale chess game getting approvals for its anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor. Combination cancer therapies were another major presentation theme. On Monday, Takeda announced it had acquired Ariad Pharmaceuticals for $5.2 billion — the deal of the week. Ariad specializes in treatments for rare cancers and leukemias. Meanwhile, Vice President Joe Biden effectively froze downtown San Francisco as he made his was to the StartUp Health Festival and the main conference to discuss his cancer moonshot. These were all pre-planned. What was more surprising was the emphasis given to oncology in other open discussions. The Diagnostics Outlook Policy Panel on Tuesday, for example, almost exclusively focused on cancer applications. Oncology wasn’t mentioned in the abstract for the panel — it was about new policies and laboratory developed tests. But the five experts discussed these topics in relation to cancer diagnostics, interpretation and care. Granted, two of the five speakers were from companies in the oncology space; Elad Gil from Color Genomics, a 30-gene cancer diagnostics company, and Jeff Huber from GRAIL, the Illumina spin-out that wants to make blood tests for early-stage cancers routine. As far as the composition of the panel swayed the discourse — that in itself is telling. Perhaps the emphasis has something to do with the relationship between genomics and cancer research. On Monday IBM Watson Health and Illumina announced a new partnership for the Watson supercomputer to rapidly and reliably interpret results from Illumina’s new cancer panel, the TruSight Tumor 170 panel. In an interview with MedCity News, Watson Health Vice President Steve Harvey said the technology could theoretically be applied to any disease area with a genetic basis. Watson Health and Illumina chose cancer as an area they believed they could make the greatest impact. It is, after all, fundamentally driven by genetic mutations.

Monoclonal antibodies have distinct structural characteristics and different targets, and their various mechanisms of action include cross-linking, blocking interactions, induction of signal transduction via receptor binding, complement-dependent cytotoxicity, and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Monoclonal antibodies should not therefore be considered a single class of treatments. Natalizumab and alemtuzumab are highly efficacious treatments approved for treating MS, though they tend to be reserved for patients with more active disease. Other monoclonal antibodies in advanced development include ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, daclizumab and opicinumab (anti-LINGO-1). Screening and monitoring is required to enable the optimal utilisation of all monoclonal antibodies and the benefit-risk profile of each monoclonal antibody needs to be fully considered before use. At present, patients have variable access to effective MS treatments, and this issue is likely to become even more important to address as new therapies become available.

Booker plans to speak out against new President Trump Print Email Jonathan D. Salant | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com By Jonathan D. Salant | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 15, 2017 at 8:34 AM, updated January 16, 2017 at 8:35 AM comments WASHINGTON -- There was a speech before a group of Democratic state legislators, an appearance on a Sunday talk show, and then a break with tradition by testifying against U.S. Attorney General-designate Jeff Sessions. After a presidential campaign where he often spoke for Hillary Clinton, U.S. Sen. Cory Booker is emerging as a leading voice of dissent in the Democratic Party as the Donald Trump era begins. The New Jersey Democrat says he's concerned that hard-fought progress in several areas such as civil rights, environmental protection, education and criminal justice could be wiped out by the new administration. "We have to let folks know we're going to fight the good fight here," Booker said in an interview in his Washington office. "This year could potentially be one of the most difficult and challenging years in modern American history." Will Booker run for president in 2020? It's a sudden turn of events for a lawmaker who arrived at the U.S. Capitol with a reputation for liking the spotlight but instead sought to hide from its glare, working quietly with members of both parties to advance legislation and using his celebrity status to help elect more Senate Democrats. Booker said the entire Senate Democratic caucus plans to speak out, but he is in a different category than many of his colleagues. At age 47, he's much younger than the Democratic leaders in Congress or the party's last presidential nominee. "There will be a passing of the torch," Democratic consultant Glenn Totten said. "Senator Booker is a very good choice." Booker brings more than just the voice of a new generation. He has 2.1 million Twitter followers and another 148,000 on Instagram. "He probably has more national name recognition than any junior senator in America," said Matthew Hale, a political science professor at Seton Hall University. "That alone makes him speaking out against Trump a big deal." Some Democrats welcomed Booker to the fight. "Cory's no longer the celebrity, he's a genuine future contender," said U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. (D-9th Dist.). "He's ready for prime time. He's articulate, he knows what he's talking about and he does his homework." While Booker said his focus was solely on 2017, others said his actions seemed aimed at the next presidential election. "This is a calculated move on his part to be the new voice of the Democratic Party," Republican consultant Craig Stevens said. Indeed, Booker's role now could fuel a future White House run, said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. "If he emerges as a leader of the opposition, Booker will be in good shape to be a top name for 2020," Zelizer said. "The role won't be easy since Trump will come at his opponents with everything he has. But if Booker can withstand it, he might emerge as a popular candidate for the next election." Booker already is being scrutinized by potential allies. Supporters of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) criticized him for voting against allowing imports of prescription drugs from foreign countries. "This vote is a disgraceful betrayal of every patient and consumer in America," said RoseAnn DeMoro, executive director of National Nurses United, which ran a pro-Sanders super political action committee.  Several major drug companies, including Johnson & Johnson and Merck & Co., call New Jersey home. In his 2013 special and 2014 general elections, Booker received $233,750 from employees of drug manufacturers, more than any other congressional candidate, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The vote was one of several during debate on a budget resolution designed to make it easier to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Besides Booker, 12 other Democrats, including U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), opposed the amendment, even as they supported two other provisions related to prescription drugs. Booker said he supported the importation of prescription drugs but the proposal lacked "consumer protections that ensure foreign drugs meet American safety standards."  Republicans said Booker could be risking his reputation as a lawmaker willing to reach across the aisle. Booker has worked with Republicans such as Tea Party favorites Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah on overhauling criminal justice. He dined with U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) during the presidential primary campaign. He and Sessions co-sponsored legislation awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to the marchers who trekked from Selma to Montgomery and won approval of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. One of those marchers, U.S. Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), testified with Booker in opposition to Sessions, who has called the law a "piece of intrusive legislation." Booker's decision to oppose Sessions didn't sit well with many Republicans. "He was looking to jump start talking about 2020," GOP consultant Chris Russell said. "I thought this was a misstep. If he still wants to be this post-partisan guy, he's doing damage to the image he's trying to build." And U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) wrote on Facebook: "Senator Booker is better than that, and he knows better." Booker said he won't be quiet. "People are going to criticize you no matter what you do, so do what's right," Booker said. "If people want to speculate or criticize or condemn, so be it. I'm taking steps I believe are the right things to do." Jonathan D. Salant may be reached at jsalant@njadvancemedia.com. Follow him on Twitter @JDSalant.

/PRNewswire/ -- Gavin Giovannoni, European Neurological Review, 2016;11(2):96-100 DOI: https://doi.org/10.17925/ENR.2016.11.02.96      (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151014/276718LOGO ) Published recently in European Neurological Review, the peer-reviewed journal from touchNEUROLOGY, Professor Giovannoni discusses the advantages of monoclonal antibodies in multiple sclerosis (MS) therapy: they are designed to be specific to their target and have very few off-target effects. Monoclonal antibodies have distinct structural characteristics and different targets, and their various mechanisms of action include cross-linking, blocking interactions, induction of signal transduction via receptor binding, complement-dependent cytotoxicity, and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Monoclonal antibodies should not therefore be considered a single class of treatments. Natalizumab and alemtuzumab are highly efficacious treatments approved for treating MS, though they tend to be reserved for patients with more active disease. Other monoclonal antibodies in advanced development include ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, daclizumab and opicinumab (anti-LINGO-1). Screening and monitoring is required to enable the optimal utilisation of all monoclonal antibodies and the benefit-risk profile of each monoclonal antibody needs to be fully considered before use. At present, patients have variable access to effective MS treatments, and this issue is likely to become even more important to address as new therapies become available. The full peer-reviewed, open-access article is available here: https://doi.org/10.17925/ENR.2016.11.02.96 Disclosure: Gavin Giovannoni has received compensation for serving as a consultant or speaker for, or has received research support from: AbbVie, Bayer Schering Healthcare, Biogen Idec, Canbex, Eisai, Elan, Five Prime Therapeutics, Genzyme, Genentech, GlaxoSmithKline, Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Merck- Serono, Novartis, Roche, Sanofi-Aventis, Synthon BV, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, UCB and Vertex Pharmaceuticals.

LONDON, January 17, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Claudia Trenkwalder, Stuart H Isaacson, Georg Ebersbach      (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151014/276718LOGO ) European Neurological Review, 2016;11(Suppl.3):2-7; http://www.touchneurology.com/articles/enhancing-patient-outcomes-current-therapies-practical-approaches-treatment-optimisation Published recently in European Neurological Review, the peer-reviewed journal from touchNEUROLOGY, Claudia Trenkwalder et al, reports on a symposium, chaired by Claudia Trenkwalder (Germany), covering the most practical and effective approaches to enhance the outcomes of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients across all disease stages. Despite taking multiple oral medications to control the symptoms of PD, many patients experience significant OFF time each day, with troublesome motor fluctuations and dyskinesias, that impact their quality of life. Stuart Isaacson (US) discussed how to optimise ON time in PD patients once fluctuations start. He highlighted the importance of considering non-oral routes of administration of PD medication to avoid gastrointestinal issues that are common in PD and can affect medication absorption. He reviewed the results of the AM-IMPAKT (Apokyn for Motor IMProvement of morning AKinesia Trial) study, which demonstrated that delayed ON and dose failure due to poor absorption of oral levodopa can be rapidly and reliably overcome with subcutaneous apomorphine injection. Georg Ebersbach (Germany) considered the later stages of disease and the management of patients who require continuous dopaminergic stimulation. Using case study illustrations, he advised how to select the correct form of advanced therapy for patients, highlighting the importance of continuous review and monitoring to optimise their outcomes.

Wells Tags: 2016 medical crimes, cancer doctors, medical criminals, monsanto shills, shills (Natural News) There’s no worse karma than betraying your fellow human beings, including children and babies, so that they take the wrong medicines and eat the wrong foods that cause sickness, cell disorder, central nervous system maladies and even death, all in the name of power, control and money. That is why the following 10 Big Food and Bad Medicine shills deserve nothing more than the Science Ass-Hat Award for being the ultimate hucksters, liars, losers and science scammers on the planet. These insidious hacks know exactly what they’re doing when they regurgitate chemical industry lies, sell the public on eating GMOs and trusting in dangerous chemotherapy, inject carcinogenic vaccines, kill healthy babies that are still in the womb, and worst of all, act like they’re actually worth something in this world. Their outright arrogance and immoral, utterly unethical-to-the-core characters simply can’t be measured on any kind of scale, but we can rank them and give them the medal of dishonor they so self-righteously deserve. (RELATED: Find real news about science at Scientific.news, and read the truth about medicine at Medicine.news) Starting from the top and working our way down to the bottom of the sellout barrel, here come the top performing science-sellout posers and clowns of the year: #1. Bill Nye: the “science fraud guy” What a total sellout goon this freak of nature has become. He went from totally questioning everything about GMOs to saying he was literally “in love” with them after visiting Monsanto headquarters where he tried on several shades of brown lipstick and learned how to pray to the most evil company on the planet – now owned by Bayer, a behemoth that not only manufactures bad medicine and chemical pesticides for agriculture, but also controls a large portion of the world’s seeds, hoping to create a monopoly and turn them all into genetic mutations. Thanks Bill Nye, you science fraud guy, for selling out like the shill you are. We know now exactly what films, books and videos to never show the kids in school. #2. Neil DeGrasse Tyson: the mascot of the fraudulent scientific industrial complex Yes, we know, you like his narration of space exploration and intellectual “star talk,” but it’s all been undermined and ruined by his complete and utter ignorance of GMOs, while acting like he’s an expert about anything that leaps from his mouth. Tyson’s mostly successful career recently took a nose dive and his public persona jumped off a steep cliff when the for-profit science industry found a new shill and mascot to spit out their usual jargon and propaganda about genetically modified food (GMOs). Tyson must be broke and in need of some quick cash, as he has taken to spewing out lies about biotechnology being the same as traditional cross-breeding that’s been occurring for “thousands of years.” By the way, Neil, scientists have not been in laboratories splicing the genes of toxic pesticides into America’s most popular crop seeds for millennia (only for the past 30 years). Stick to your “star talk” and quit pushing cancer food on the masses for quick cash. GMOs are not safe and do not occur naturally. The irony is that so many celebrities today are uneducated about the foods we eat, so for endorsements, they model the worst of all habits and sell innocent people their own slow, miserable death. Tyson’s ramped-up promotion of GMO foods is suspect, to say the least, considering he is comparing GM corn and soy that contain carcinogens to seedless watermelons and long-stem roses. #3. Senator Richard Pan: California’s “mercury joker” The Eli Lilly shill, a.k.a. the “Mercury Joker” has cornered the market on chemical-based child abuse in California. What easier way is there to make a fortune as an unethical doctor than to force-vaccinate millions of children, including black boys who, according to the lead CDC scientist, Dr. William Thompson, are more susceptible to getting autism from mercury injections, and then pretending to “treat” them with other dangerous drugs their whole lives? Pan is a huckster and propagandist who takes big money from big pharma for his political campaigns, while promoting dangerous chemical medicine and laws to jab it all into humans, including infants and pregnant women. Thanks “Joker,” you’ve won third place in the science shill Ass-Hat competition of 2016. #4. David H. Gorski, a.k.a. Orac: the psycho-blogger This internet clown abuses people online, especially anyone who questions vaccines or chemotherapy. He takes breaks from surgery and runs to his computer like a little rat, typing thousands of words, blogs, replies and rants on medical message boards, all while his patients lie on operating tables waiting for him to finish sewing them up. Do his patients even really have cancer? Gorski has been reported to the FBI for suspicious activity, and features some of the worst reviews from patients you will ever read. He may be the most arrogant doctor alive today who’s – somehow – still practicing medicine. He may have been named as a co-conspirator by Dr. Farid Fata, who worked under the same institution “umbrella” of Karmanos Cancer Care in Detroit. Fata is serving 45 years in federal prison for dosing patients to death with high doses of chemotherapy, even when they didn’t have cancer. Fata is next on the list of top science Ass-Hats of the year. Dr. “Orac,” the mentally deranged surgeon, cyber bully and surgical quack, is now linked to a “skeptics” kingpin (James Randi – amateur magician) and pervert caught on tape soliciting sex from a young man, according to sources. #5. Dr. Farid Fata: the most insidious and evil cancer doctor ever This story is so insane you’d think it’s a horror movie theme instead of real life. On July 10th, 2015, Detroit area oncologist Farid Fata, M.D., was sentenced to only 45 years in prison for administering chemotherapy to healthy patients, some of whom died, and for defrauding Medicare and private insurance companies out of more than $30 million. The freak pleaded guilty to 13 counts of healthcare fraud, two counts of money laundering and one count of conspiracy involving kickbacks. He even injected his dying patients during their last few days of life with more of his massively intense “European Protocol” mixture of intravenously-fed chemo drugs. Here’s the rub: Fata operated from multiple locations in and around Detroit, where one of his cohorts (who has since denied knowing him) may have been named as a co-conspirator. “Orac” the psycho-blogger has been reported to the FBI. If you are aware of any misconduct or misdiagnoses by one David H. Gorski, surgical oncologist at Karmanos, be sure to report it! #6. Bill Gates – master of the Zika virus hoax No, Bill Gates is not just a computer whiz who wants the best technology for the world. Gates is a globalist who wants to get rid of billions of people in the next two decades using vaccines and GMOs as “weapons of mass destruction.” Pretending to be a philanthropist who cares about third world countries, Gates is actually one of many rich white dudes whose ultimate goal is to sterilize minorities and wipe them off the face of the earth with cancer-causing, genetically mutated corn and soy. If you are not aware that toxic vaccines and GMOs are bio-weapons of the 21st century, start doing some homework. Watch out for a fake Zika vaccine that might come out soon! That’s why Bill Gates ranks in at number 6 in the science-shill Ass-Hat awards of 2016. #7. Kevin Folta: the ultimate Monsanto shill If Folta had his way, he’d have the whole country believing that he’s just an honest horticulture scientist and academic at the University of Florida who cares about people, food and farming. This clown poses on talk radio as a geek who interviews himself, asking himself Monsanto-fed questions and answering using scripted lines to promote everything GMO as safe and beneficial, so that he can take his shill vacations in Hawaii paid for by Monsanto. Folta uses organic words like sustainability when talking about dangerous chemical-based pesticides. Just like Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Folta wants Americans to believe that GMOs are just another step in traditional breeding. The US Right to Know Group exposed Folta for the shill he really is when they dredged up FOIA paperwork and emails showing discussions with Monsanto reps about how he would say anything they wanted him to say. That’s why the sad, geeky Folta is ranked number 7 for the Ass-Hat science shill awards of 2016. #8. Robert Santella: the demonic, psycho abortion doctor Yes, there are doctors in America who love killing children and babies. This freak got caught on video in a rant that went viral and got him fired. Coming in at number 8 for the ultimate “Science Ass-Hat of the Year” award is psycho abortion doctor Santella, who may be still be killing babies at a new, different institution. Beware! #9. Dr. Julie Gerberding: former CDC director and current Merck shill This evil nut-job was a key conspirator in covering up the vaccine-autism link that was later completely exposed by Dr. William Thompson, head CDC scientist, who had already alerted Gerberding to the evil data manipulation going on at the CDC. Now, she heads up Merck’s evil vaccine marketing and promotions division. Congratulations Gerberding, you’re ranked number 9 in the science shilling Ass-Hat competition of 2016. #10. Jon Entine: the ultimate GMO apologist, corporate propagandist and alleged violent wife-beater A former favorite GMO propagandist for Forbes.com, this chemical-pesticide huckster and charlatan dragged his now ex-wife and teenaged daughter through courts for years while he allegedly abused them time and time again, actually choking his wife in front of the daughter. Entine shills for Monsanto and Syngenta, publishing false information in mainstream publications to con Americans into eating cancer food. Entine also won the Corrupt Journalist Award for being a low-life scoundrel and pushing multiple corporate lies at Forbes.com. Also, 2016 was such a special year for science Ass-Hats, that a bonus ass-clown award goes out, at number 11, to Paul Offit, the science muppet! This clown and vaccine-pushing puppet invented and patented the most dangerous vaccine known to mankind: RotaTeq, the rotavirus vaccine. Chock full of neurotoxins that cause autism, the rotavirus vaccine was invented by the same man who pretends to care about autistic children. Imagine the arrogance and hypocrisy. The only reason Offit cares about autistic children is because they serve as more cash in his bank account, as the CDC has put Offit’s toxic vaccine on its schedule of mandatory vaccinations for children. Unbelievable. That is why Offit the Muppet is number 11 on the 2016 science Ass-Hat of the Year award list. Congratulations you sellout hucksters. You all deserve exactly what’s coming your way: bad karma.
