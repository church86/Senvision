Print Share All News Consumer Pharma New Drugs Pipeline Clinical Trials FDA Alerts Merck and Pfizer Announce Investigational Ertugliflozin Met Primary Endpoint of A1C Reduction When Added to Sitagliptin and Metformin in People with Type 2 Diabetes Tweet KENILWORTH, N.J., and NEW YORK, N.Y., September 15, 2016 -- Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, in partnership with Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced that a Phase 3 study (VERTIS SITA2) of ertugliflozin, an investigational oral SGLT2 inhibitor for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes, met its primary endpoint. Both 5 mg and 15 mg daily doses of ertugliflozin showed significantly greater reductions in A1C* of 0.69 percent and 0.76 percent, respectively, compared with placebo (p<0.001, for both comparisons), when added to patients on a background of sitagliptin (100 mg/day) and stable metformin (≥1500 mg/day). These study results were presented for the first time during an oral session today at the 52nd Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) in Munich, Germany. Merck and Pfizer plan to submit New Drug Applications to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for ertugliflozin and two fixed-dose combinations (ertugliflozin plus JANUVIA® (sitagliptin) and ertugliflozin plus metformin) by the end of 2016, with additional regulatory submissions outside of the U.S. to follow in 2017. “It is encouraging to see further data from the VERTIS clinical development program in support of combining ertugliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, with the DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin, which was first approved 10 years ago,” said Peter Stein, M.D., vice president, late stage development, diabetes and endocrinology, Merck. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, 463 patients with type 2 diabetes and a baseline A1C of 7.0 – 10.5 percent were randomized to receive ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg, or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. In addition to meeting the primary endpoint of reducing A1C at 26 weeks, ertugliflozin also met the following key secondary endpoints in the study: A greater proportion of patients taking ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg achieved the A1C treatment goal of less than 7.0 percent (32.1 percent and 39.9 percent, respectively) compared with the placebo group (17.0 percent) (p<0.001, for both comparisons based on adjusted odds ratios); Placebo-adjusted mean reduction in body weight of 4.4 lbs (2.0 kg) for the 5 mg dose and 3.7 lbs (1.7 kg) for the 15 mg dose (p<0.001, for both comparisons); Placebo-adjusted mean reductions in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of 25.1 mg/dl (1.4 mmol/L) for the 5 mg dose and 31.3 mg/dl (1.7 mmol/L) for the 15 mg dose (p<0.001, for both comparisons); Placebo-adjusted mean reductions in systolic blood pressure of 2.9 mmHg (5 mg, p=0.019) and 3.9 mmHg (15 mg, p=0.002). “We are pleased to share these new data on investigational ertugliflozin with the scientific community, following the first presentations of Phase 3 data for ertugliflozin at the American Diabetes Association’s 76th Scientific Sessions in June,” said James Rusnak, M.D., Ph.D., chief development officer, cardiovascular & metabolics, Pfizer. “Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease and these study results help support the clinical profile of ertugliflozin as an add-on therapy for patients who may require multiple treatment combinations to help reach their blood sugar goals.” Overall adverse event (AE) rates were generally similar between ertugliflozin 5 mg (41.7 percent), ertugliflozin 15 mg (43.8 percent) and placebo (48.4 percent), with a similar rate of one or more serious AEs across all groups (4.5 percent for ertugliflozin 5 mg; 2.0 percent for ertugliflozin 15 mg; 3.3 percent for placebo). The rates of discontinuations due to AEs were low across all groups (3.2 percent for ertugliflozin 5 mg; 0.7 percent for ertugliflozin 15 mg; 0.7 percent for placebo). In the study, a higher incidence of genital mycotic infections was observed in patients taking ertugliflozin 5 mg and ertugliflozin 15 mg (males: 4.9 percent and 3.7 percent, respectively, vs. no events for placebo; females: 8.0 percent and 12.7 percent, respectively, vs. 1.9 percent for placebo). Urinary tract infection rates were low across the ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg and placebo groups (2.6 percent, 4.6 percent and 2.0 percent, respectively). Across groups, there were similar rates for symptomatic hypoglycemia (3.8 percent for ertugliflozin 5 mg; 0.7 percent for ertugliflozin 15 mg; 2.6 percent for placebo) and for hypovolemia adverse events (0.6 percent for ertugliflozin 5 mg; no events for ertugliflozin 15 mg; 0.7 percent for placebo). About the VERTIS Clinical Development Program for Ertugliflozin In addition to the VERTIS MONO and VERTIS FACTORIAL studies, which were presented at the 76th Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association, VERTIS SITA2 is a part of the VERTIS clinical development program comprised of a total of nine Phase 3 trials in approximately 12,600 adults with type 2 diabetes. Results from the other six VERTIS trials will be submitted for publication and/or presentation at future scientific congresses.

In its filing in the US district court of Delaware, Sanofi claims that Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. violated 10 patents held by it, including ones for its diabetes treatment Lantus and its insulin delivery device SoloStar. The French firm said it commenced the legal proceedings against Merck after the US company's filing for new drugs applications with the US Food & Drug Administration. A Merck spokeswoman was quoted by the Wall Street Journal as saying, the company’s product doesn’t infringe Sanofi’s patents. Lantus accounted for nearly 20% of Sanofi's total revenues in 2015. Lantus sales in the US fell 20.5% to €4.023bn last year. In the first half of this year, Lantus sales declined another 15% to €2.38bn. In January 2014, Sanofi filed a suit against Eli Lilly and Company to defend its patents on Lantus. The companies have however entered into a settlement agreement in September 2015, under which Lilly agreed to delay the launch of its insulin product to December 2016 and pay royalties to Sanofi.

(PRWEB) September 21, 2016 Bioclinica®, a provider of specialized technology-enabled services supporting clinical trials, today announced that bio-pharma and CROs convened at its 2016 Annual Global eHealth Conference held in Chicago earlier this month. The event drew together an international group that shared eHealth vision as well as lessons learned, best practices, and success stories using Bioclinica eHealth technologies to advance clinical development. “There was a tremendous exchange of ideas, generating an exciting vision as to where we can go as an industry if we allow this remarkable technology to take us there,” said Bioclinica President of eHealth Solutions Mukhtar Ahmed. “The Bioclinica eHealth platform is a driving force for industry change, benefitting patients and the entire research community.” Attendees heard from more than 30 speakers representing a mix of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and CROs, among them Baxter Healthcare; Biogen; Cardialysis; Fisher Clinical; Gilead; GSK; Janssen; Merck; Pfizer; Pharmacyclics; Premier Research; Ultragenyx; and Worldwide Clinical Trials. Participating App xChange partners included Vitrana, ArisGlobal, AiCure, Arivis, and Parallel 6. Glen Tullman, Chairman and CEO of Livongo Health and former CEO of Allscripts, delivered a provocative keynote, “The Coming Sea of Change in Healthcare.” Tullman traced the healthcare revolution to date, exploring trends and “dramatic consequences felt on every facet of healthcarefrom EHRs and chronic disease, to pharmaceuticals, clinical trials, and everything in between.” Bioclinica eHealth Solutions Chief Technology Officer Andrew Masters presented the product roadmap for the eHealth business segment comprising the eClinical, Safety & Regulatory, and Financial Lifecycle Solutions divisions. Masters recapped recent significant developments made over the past 12 months marked by several product launches by all three divisions, as well as core product enhancements to OnPoint CTMS, Trident RTSM, Express EDC, and Compass for risk-based monitoring. Masters said, “Our eHealth team is continually innovating with our customers to keep them out front with a dynamic technology platform.” He noted several key eClinical systems integrations, including with App xChange partners, as well as integrations between ClinPay and EDC systems, both Bioclinica’s Express and other providers. Session highlights include: eHealth Solutions Vice President of Technology Alliances Anne Zielinski teamed with Tullman and Masters in a panel discussion on the current and future state of clinical trials, examining mobile health, patient centricity, and big data. Zielinski also spoke in a session on patient centricity, showing how eHealth App xChange technology can close the gap between patients, clinical researchers, and other stakeholders for a better patient experience. “Bioclinica’s App xChange provides an extended eHealth platform, making the research process easier and more engaging for patients and less burdensome on all involved,” said Zielinski. Jay Ehrlich, Vice President of Global Patient Safety, Baxter Healthcare, presented on pharmacovigilance as a service (PVaaS), a unique end-to-end safety solutions offering introduced by Bioclinica earlier this year. Baxter and other biopharma companies have quickly embraced the model in which Bioclinica safety experts address all pharmacovigilance aspects, including application implementation, management and hosting, business process support, workflow automation, and quality management for more efficient resource utilization. A case study presented by Cognizant in which Bioclinica’s Trident IRT Plus program, a Randomization and Trial Supply Management (RTSM) study implementation model used by AbbVie, enables dynamic responses to evolving business requirements. Cognizant’s IRT Onsite Coordinator Shiny Vincent and AbbVie’s Principal Interface Designer E-Quana Graham, presented with Bioclinica’s Vice President of RTSM and Supply Chain Ken Clark on how Bioclinica’s IRTPlus program has accelerated study delivery at AbbVie. “Using an agile IRT approach enables Bioclinica’s customers to build and maintain high-quality studies despite a great degree of study complexity,” explained Clark. Jay Trepanier, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Bioclinica Financial Lifecycle Solutions presented an overview on ClinPay and ClinPlan, core components used by biopharma companies and CROs to automate the financial lifecycle in clinical trials, including the site and patient payment process. eClinical General Manager Mike Petrarca co-presented with Director of eClinical Solutions Jennifer Price on the end-to-end clinical trial eHealth platform. They showed the patient data journey beginning with planning of clinical supplies, followed by the use of different mobile devices for data entry, on through to the making of site and patient payments, and performing activities such as patient safety monitoring. The eHealth Conference, in addition to serving as a key source of industry information, provided Bioclinica product engineers and professional services team a forum to stay connected to customers’ emerging technology needs. “We thank everyone who participated in this exceptional event,” Masters said. “The customer and partner engagement experienced during the eHealth Conference serves to strengthen the value Bioclinica is able to deliver along this exciting journey.” A partial listing of upcoming industry events featuring Bioclinica experts includes: 2016 Global Site Solutions Summit, October 13-16 2016 European Global Clinical Supplies Group Conference, October 18-20 IRT 2016, October 28-29 DIA Japan, November 13-15 PCT Europe 2016, November 16-17 For the latest Company news and information, follow Bioclinica on the blog at http://www.bioclinica.com/blog and on Twitter at http://twitter.com/bioclinica.

The EU regulator has agreed to start its review of BMS' application based on the results of the phase II CheckMate-275 study of PD-1 inhibitor Opdivo (nivolumab) in metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) patients previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy.  UC accounts for around 90% of all cases of bladder cancer, which in turn is the fifth most common cancer affecting almost 430,000 people every year.  Approval in that large indication would give Opdivo a boost after a disappointing outcome in a first-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) trial that handed a competitive advantage to rival PD- inhibitor - Merck & Co's Keytruda (pembrolizumab) - in that indication. The filing puts BMS just behind Roche in the EU race to market for immuno-oncology treatments for bladder cancer. Roche has already bagged a US approval for PD-L1 inhibitor Tecentriq (atezolizumab) for second-line UC in the US and seems to have filed the drug for that indication in Europe - although the company has made no public announcement to that effect. Keytruda has also shown efficacy in bladder cancer but according to Merck's latest pipeline update has not yet been filed for approval in this indication. Meanwhile, BMS is also talking to the FDA about a marketing application based on the CheckMate-275 data, which is due to be reported at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress next month. Bladder cancer has proved to be remarkably resistant to new drug therapy. The standard of care remains cisplatin and there have been few treatment advances over the last 30 years, so immuno-oncology agents are expected to make swift and dramatic headway both in the second- and first-line treatment settings. Analysts have predicted that Tecentriq could become a $3bn product if its first-mover advantage in bladder cancer is bolstered by follow-up approvals in lung, colorectal, urogenital and kidney cancers.

Volatile oil prices pressured energy shares, limiting overall gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose a tepid 9.79 points, or less than 0.1%, to close at 18,129.96, with gainers and decliners split evenly among the 30 Dow components. The Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 6.33 points, or 0.1%, to 5,241.35, nudged higher by gains in biotech. The S&P 500 index finished up less than a point at 2,139.76. Health care and consumer staples led winners, while energy shares lagged behind. Merck & Co.and McDonald's topped advancers, while Exxon Mobil and DuPont& Co. were the worst blue-chip performers. Among economic data expected at Wall Street, Housing starts for August came in at a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.142 million (consensus 1.186 million) while building permits fell to 1.139 million (consensus 1.160 million) due entirely to a 7.2% decline in permits for multi-unit dwellings. The data follows yesterday's above-consensus reading of the NAHB Housing Market Index for September. Although overall market reaction to weaker-than-expected housing starts data ahead of the bell was muted, home-building stocks such as Lennar Corp and PulteGroup were hit hard, falling 3.5% and 2.9% respectively. The Fed will release its updated policy statement at 2 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday. Investors widely expect the central bank to stand pat on interest rates, so attention is instead being trained on the BOJ where policy surprises are seen as more likely. Japanese policy makers have fought hard in recent years to battle low inflation, slow growth and a strong yen, lowering rates into negative territory and launching an aggressive asset-purchase program. However, there is a heightened sense the measures aren't producing their desired result. The health care sector outperformed as drug manufacturers and biotechnology names displayed relative strength. Biotechnology rallied after Allergan agreed to acquire Tobira Therapeutics for an upfront payment of $28.35 per share. This constitutes a 498.0% premium from Tobira's prior closing price. The agreement also contains Contingent Value Rights that could increase total considerations up to $49.84 per share. Crude oil futures ended on a mixed note on Tuesday, 20 September 2016 with Brent crude modestly lower but West Texas Intermediate crude slightly higher, as traders weighed the possibility of a crude output deal following reports that Russia supports a one-year pact to stabilize prices.nHowever, weekly data expected to show the first increase in U.S. crude supplies in three weeks and a substantial slide by gasoline futures, with a major gasoline pipeline expected to return to operation on Wednesday, kept prices in check. October West Texas Intermediate crude rose by 14 cents, or 0.3%, to settle at $43.44 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange on the contract's expiration day. The November WTI contract which became the front month, added 19 cents, or 0.4%, to $44.05. However, November Brent crude on the ICE Futures exchange in London lost 7 cents, or less than 0.2%, to finish at $45.88 a barrel. Bullion prices ended in a mixed mode on Tuesday, 20 September 2016 at Comex. Gold futures on Tuesday ended with a slight gain, but moved in a narrow trading range, as focus remained fixed on the dollar's next move a day ahead of policy announcements from the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan. December gold picked up 40 cents to settle at $1,318.20 an ounce. The metal closed 0.6% higher on Monday. December silver fell 1.3 cents, or less than 0.1%, to $19.277 an ounce on Tuesday. The ICE U.S. dollar index, a measure of the greenback against six currencies, was up 0.2%. Treasuries ended on a higher note with the long end of the curve outperforming. The yield on the 2-yr note fell one basis point (0.77%) while the yield on the 10-yr note declined three basis points (1.69%). Today's participation was below the recent average as fewer than 741 million shares changed hands on the NYSE floor. Tomorrow's economic data will be limited to the weekly MBA Mortgage Index, which will be released at 7:00 ET. Meanwhile, the FOMC will release its September policy statement and rate decision at 14:00 ET.

This feature is brought to you by The Scotsman and Young Company Finance. Rebecca Pick with her Personal Guardian attack alarm, set to launch next year. Picture: Contributed Glasgow safety alarm start-up secures £744,000 funding A Glasgow-based start-up that has developed a personal attack alarm has raised £744,000 to help bring the product to market. Pick Protection is the brainchild of University of Strathclyde graduate Rebecca Pick, who developed the idea for the Personal Guardian device following an attack on a neighbour. Having raised £60,000 from an angle investment syndicate last year, the firm has now secured £744,000 in a funding round led by Equity Gap, with other backers including the University of Strathclyde, Gabriel Investment Syndicate, the Scottish Investment Bank and manufacturer Unipart Group. Tobacco giant BAT eyes £38bn merger with Camel owner British American Tobacco (BAT) has proposed a $47 billion (£38bn) merger with US tobacco firm Reynolds, the maker of Camel and Pall Mall. If it goes ahead, the deal would create the world’s largest listed tobacco company. BAT currently owns 42.2 per cent of Reynolds and the proposal involves the acquisition of the remaining 57.8 per cent of the company. Heathrow boss insists airport has support for expansion Heathrow Airport’s chief executive has said there remains support “from Newquay to Inverness” for the government to rule in favour of the airport’s expansion over rival Gatwick. John Holland‑Kaye also said Theresa May was “showing leadership”, despite the Prime Minister being accused of dithering over the decision on a third runway. “There’s no policy reason at all stopping us from getting on with Heathrow,” he added. Martin Flanagan: Humiliation for BHS ‘spiv’ Philip Green “It doesn’t get much heavier and more humiliating than a unanimous recommendation of MPs that the Honours Forfeiture Committee strip Sir Philip Green of his knighthood,” writes Martin Flanagan. “The language yesterday, protected by parliamentary privilege, was ripe. ‘Billionaire spiv’, ‘personal fiefdoms’, ‘traditional asset stripper’ and ‘one of the biggest corporate scandals of modern times’ give a flavour of it.” Click here to ‘Like’ The Scotsman Business on Facebook For anyone interested in following the progress of early stage companies in Scotland, and in particular how they fund their development, the monthly newsletter published by Young Company Finance (www.ycfscotland.co.uk) is an essential resource.

Picture: Jane Barlow EMMA NEWLANDS 07:19 Wednesday 21 September 2016 0 Have your say The University of Dundee has renewed seven-figure funding from three top pharmaceutical companies, supporting work to launch and speed up the development of new drugs to treat diseases like cancer and Parkinson’s. The £7.2 million funding from industry to academia comes from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Boehringer Ingelheim, and Merck, and secures 38 posts at Dundee for the next four years. The university said the sum will support its division of signal transduction therapy (DSTT), the world’s longest-running collaboration between academic research laboratories and the pharmaceutical industry, and founded in 1998. READ MORE: Dundee University one of Europe’s most innovative The division works to help identify new drug targets and then accelerate the early-phase development of better treatments for major global diseases. Additionally, 12 of its 22 research teams are based in the Medical Research Council Protein Phosphorylation and Ubiquitylation Unit (MRC-PPU). Dario Alessi, MRC-PPU director, said: “I am absolutely thrilled that we have been able to renew this remarkable 18-year flagship collaboration with our pharmaceutical partners. This alliance has never been more important as our Dundee-based researchers are making such tremendous progress in better understanding human diseases such as Parkinson’s, immune conditions and cancer.” Malcolm Skingle, director of academic liaison at GSK, said that by working with the university “we’re making inroads in our understanding of a broad range of chronic diseases, and we believe that by continuing our work together we’ll be able to accelerate the translation of this knowledge in to new treatments for patients”.

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, is now in the sights of more than a dozen drugmakers. Allergan Plc became the latest Tuesday. It announced two deals in less than 12 hours to acquire companies developing NASH treatments, including Tobira Therapeutics Inc. for as much as $1.7 billion in what Chief Executive Officer Brent Saunders said Wednesday was a “very competitive situation.” Allergan is racing companies ranging from startup Intercept Pharmaceuticals Inc. to giants including Gilead Sciences Inc. and Pfizer Inc. to reach an untapped market that could be worth $5 billion to $10 billion a year, according to a May estimate by RBC Capital Markets Corp. analyst Michael Yee. Drugmakers are still working to determine how different components of the disease -- inflammation, scarring and metabolic changes -- interact and are experimenting with a variety of treatment mechanisms. With so many companies piling into the field, they’ll have to work to distinguish themselves. “We’re looking for something that’s got a ‘wow’ factor,” said Alex DePaoli, chief medical officer of closely held NGM Biopharmaceuticals Inc., which has a NASH partnership with Merck & Co. “We want to develop something that pops your eyes out.” Fatty Liver NASH occurs when fat accumulates in the liver along with inflammation and damage, and as much as a quarter of the U.S. population may have a precursor condition, called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The ailment develops slowly, and patients often don’t show symptoms until their livers are heavily damaged. It’s most common in people who are overweight or have diabetes, and doctors mainly prescribe diet changes and weight loss. While doctors need to perform a biopsy to diagnose NASH, about 6 million to 15 million people in the U.S. alone are estimated to have the condition, and about 20 percent of them will go on to develop life-threatening cirrhosis. NASH will be the leading cause of liver transplants by 2020, according to Allergan. Drugs that treat it will likely command high prices, Elizabeth Krutoholow, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said. At the head of the race are Intercept and French biotech firm Genfit, with large trials underway. Tobira, which has the deal with Allergan, is preparing to recruit patients for a final-stage study. Investors are also watching for results from two of Gilead’s mid-stage trials that are expected to be presented this year. Leading Candidates Intercept is testing Ocaliva, already approved to treat a rare liver disease called primary biliary cirrhosis, against NASH. Enrollment of a final-stage trial of 2,000 people is expected to be completed next year, with interim results due in 2019. A potential concern is that in an earlier trial some patients experienced itching when taking the drug, in some cases so severe that it interfered with basic activities. CEO Mark Pruzanski said in an interview that he hopes Ocaliva will become a backbone treatment, used in combination with other drugs. Genfit is developing elafibranor, a once-a-day-treatment that raises fat metabolism and fights inflammation, to “treat the underlying cause of fibrosis,” Dean Hum, Genfit’s chief scientific officer, said in an interview. While elafibranor failed to meet a primary goal in a mid-stage trial last year, it showed promise in a subset of patients with moderate and severe forms of the disease. A final-stage trial in 2,000 moderate and severe patients is underway, and the company may have data by late 2018.  Big Pharma Beyond the startup biotechs, some of the biggest companies are paying attention and ready to do deals. Merck said it will pay as much as $450 million for its partnership with NGM. Gilead, maker of the blockbuster hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni,  bought a NASH drug from Nimbus Therapeutics LLC for $1.2 billion, including milestone payments. Before that, Gilead also bought a drug from Phenex Pharmaceuticals AG for as much as $470 million.  Gilead now has four NASH candidates in its portfolio and will have data from two later this year. The drugs target different aspects of the disease and will be developed individually, but may be used in potent cocktails. Allergan’s Tobira is the biggest NASH deal so far, and on Tuesday the company also announced a $50 million purchase of Akarna Therapeutics Ltd., another developer of NASH treatments. Pfizer, the biggest U.S. drugmaker, may be a future acquirer. It has a NASH drug in trials and two more to be tested in humans by the end of the year. NASH is “a major priority,” said Morris Birnbaum, chief scientific officer of cardiovascular and metabolic disease. The company is trying to treat the disease in its early stages. It won’t be easy. Along with Genfit, Tobira’s mid-stage trial failed, and Raptor Pharmaceutical Corp. ended its program. “Data is starting to come out of studies, and a lot of confidence will be built and lost,” said Jay Luly, chief executive officer of Enanta Pharmaceuticals Inc., which will begin testing an experimental treatment in patients this year. “The same, I expect, will happen with money.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

They were among the industry leaders who testified Tuesday at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on agricultural consolidation. The Bayer-Monsanto deal comes as other acquisitions in the agricultural sector are pending. Dow Chemical and DuPont are midway through the regulatory process, while ChemChina and Switzerland-based Syngenta also have a proposed deal. ChemChina is operated by the Chinese government and was the only company that did not send a representative to the hearing on Capitol Hill. The original Monsanto was founded in St. Louis in 1901. Credit Carolina Hidalgo | St. Louis Public Radio Monsanto and Bayer representatives point to the rising cost of doing business as a key reason for the wave of consolidations. Part of that is the increasing amount of money that needs to be pumped into innovation. Monsanto says it's annual research and development costs have soared over the past 15 years from roughly $300 million to $1.5 billion. "Now I know that sounds like a big number," Robb Fraley, Monsanto's chief technology officer told the committee. "But compare that against the data and life science leaders -- like a Microsoft, or an Apple, or a Pfizer, or a Merck -- who each invest over $10 billion a year in R&D." A bigger company means a larger pot for research and development investment. It's an argument the companies likely hope will ease the concerns of farmers who contend the larger business would slow down the pace of innovation, possibly to protect existing profitable technologies. Bayer CropScience North America's president insists there will be a huge focus on innovation, if regulators approve the acquisition of Monsanto.  Jim Blome points to estimates suggesting the global population will increase by three-billion by mid-century and farmers will need to meet those food demands. "They know crop yields must increase by 60 percent," Blome told committee members. "This will not happen without continued investment in new technologies." That's also an important point for the National Corn Growers Association, which is based in Chesterfield. "In an era of declining federal and state agricultural research funding, these agribusiness research investments are vital to the future of food production," Chris Novak, the association's chief executive officer said. "Consolidation can provide farmers better access to technology through expanded research platforms," although Novak said the organization is concerned about consolidation being compounded by domestic and international regulatory hurdles. Jobs and St. Louis Committee members tried to press some of the executives on future job plans. Bayer and Monsanto representatives did not provide numbers. But they stressed the importance of St. Louis. Bayer’s Jim Blome repeated the company’s decision to move the North American and seeds headquarters to the region. They are currently in North Carolina, where Bayer says it will keep a significant presence. Monsanto’s Fraley also referred to the headquarters location as a positive for the St. Louis area including the Chesterfield research site, which is undergoing a $400 million expansion. “This will be an incredible opportunity to drive innovation.” The Bayer-Monsanto deal was announced last week. It still needs regulatory approval in the U.S. and dozens of other countries. If that happens, the acquisition could close next year.

Global stock markets traded with a positive bias Tuesday, Sept. 20, 2016, a day ahead of policy statements from the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan that could go a long way to driving sentiment over the rest of the year. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Updated at 3:40 p.m. NEW YORK •  U.S. stocks inched higher Tuesday in another cautious day of trading as investors kept an eye on central banks in the U.S. and Japan. Health care and household goods companies led the way while energy companies slipped. Major market indexes were higher all day, but returned most of those gains at the close of trading. They rose just enough cancel out Monday's small losses. Drug companies helped health care stocks make some modest gains, while Exxon Mobil fell on reports it's being investigated by securities regulators. Bond yields slipped and the dollar was little changed as investors waited decisions from the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan. Since investors doubt the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates Wednesday, they may focus instead on the Fed's statement and a press conference led by Fed Chair Janet Yellen. "The Fed, until they raise rates, are going to be the primary focus of the markets," said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. "The only reason people may take their eye off of that is the election." The Dow Jones industrial average gained 9.79 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,129.96. The Standard & Poor's 500 index added 0.64 points to 2,139.76. The Nasdaq composite picked up 6.33 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,241.35. On the New York Stock Exchange, more stocks fell than rose. That was the reverse of Monday, when major indexes fell but more stocks were up than down. Tuesday was the start of two-day meetings for the Fed and Bank of Japan. While investors didn't expect an increase in U.S. interest rates, the Japanese central bank is expected to take new steps to boost the nation's ailing economy. That could include an increase in its stimulus program or a further cut in the deposit rate as a way to encourage banks to lend money. Gilead Sciences gained $2.79, or 3.5 percent, to $81.78 after the hepatitis C drugmaker completed a $5 billion debt offering. Gilead said it may use the cash to make a deal, and Jefferies & Co. analyst Brian Abrahams said he thinks the company is getting close to at least one acquisition. Elsewhere, Merck rose 61 cents, or 1 percent, to $61.94. Ascena Retail Group, the parent of Ann Taylor, Lane Bryant and Dress Barn, dropped to a six-year low after the company reported weak quarterly results and gave a forecast that fell short of investor expectations. Ascena bought Ann Taylor a year ago and also struggled with discounts from competitors and shaky demand. Its stock lost $2.43, or 29.9 percent, to $5.69. Allergan, the maker of Botox, announced yet another acquisition as it agreed to buy Tobira Therapeutics. Tobira is studying drugs that treat symptoms of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, a disease that triggers inflammation that can lead to cirrhosis, cancer and liver failure. Tobira stock has tumbled this year after it reported mixed results from a mid-stage trial of one of its drugs. The shares finished at $4.74 on Monday, but Allergan agreed to pay $28.35 per share upfront, and could pay another $49.84 if Tobira's drugs succeed in clinical testing, win regulatory approved, and meet sales targets. Tobira shares skyrocketed to $38.91 and Allergan fell $6.62, or 2.7 percent, to $238.67.

Monthly housing figures can be volatile and housing starts have grown this year, but the report hurt shares of homebuilders. PulteGroup gave up 58 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $19.29 and Lennar, which reported strong quarterly results, shed $1.59, or 3.5 percent, to $43.50. Hotel chains Marriott and Starwood climbed after regulators in China approved the $14.41 billion deal that will bring them together to create the world's largest hotel chain. Marriott, which is buying Starwood, said it expects to complete the deal Friday. Its stock added $1.60, or 2.3 percent, to $69.94 and Starwood rose $1.81, or 2.4 percent, to $76.90. Royal Caribbean Cruises added $2.93, or 4.5 percent, to $68.41 after the company raised its quarterly dividend to 48 cents from 37.5 cents. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to 1.69 percent from 1.71 percent. The dollar rose to 101.84 yen from 101.81 yen. The euro slipped to $1.1157 from $1.1178. Benchmark U.S. crude picked up 14 cents to $43.44 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slipped 7 cents to $45.88 a barrel in London. Exxon Mobil lost $1.29, or 1.5 percent, to $82.54 after Dow Jones reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Exxon's accounting practices and other issues. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline sank 6 cents, or 4 percent, to $1.36 a gallon. Heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.41 a gallon. Natural gas jumped 11 cents, or 3.9 percent, to $3.05 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold gained 40 cents to $1,318.20 an ounce. Silver lost 1 cent to $19.28 an ounce. Copper added 1 cent to $2.17 a pound. France's CAC 40 slipped 0.1 percent while Germany's DAX rose 0.2 percent. In Britain, the FTSE 100 index was 0.3 percent higher. Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225 closed down 0.2 percent and South Korea's Kospi added 0.5 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong dipped 0.1 percent.

The industry announcement coincides with a high-level meeting on antimicrobial resistance as part of the UN General Assembly in New York. Companies that have signed up to the scheme include leaders in both branded and generic drug production, including Pfizer, Merck, Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline and Allergan, as well as Indian drug-makers Cipla and Wockhardt. The group will work with independent experts to set new factory standards and review supply chains to ensure antibiotic waste does not enter waterways, where it can lead to the breeding of superbugs. Efforts to prevent overuse of antibiotics will involve a review of promotional activities and the implementation, by 2020, of concrete measures such as the removal of incentives to sell the drugs in larger volumes. Though the problem of drug-resistant bacteria has been a feature of medicine since the discovery of penicillin in 1928, it has grown in recent years with the emergence of infections resistant to multiple drugs, such as MRSA.

GlaxoSmithKline announced Tuesday that Emma Walmsley (pictured) will succeed Andrew Witty as CEO. Walmsley is currently the head of GSK's consumer healthcare business, which includes brands such as Excedrin, Flonase, and TheraFlu. 2. The FDA approved the first drug for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The agency's decision to approve Sarepta Therapeutics' eteplirsen comes after months of support from vocal patient communities who called for the approval. Sarepta said the drug will cost $300,000 on average per year. (WaPo) 3. Sanofi filed a lawsuit against Merck for allegedly infringing on the patent of its long-acting insulin, Lantus. The French drugmaker said Merck violated as many as 10 patents, including for Lantus' delivery device, which is called the SoloStar. (WSJ) 4. Allergan said it will buy Tobira Therapeutics — a developer of treatments for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH — in a deal worth up to $1.7 billion. Just last week, Allergan agreed to buy Vitae Pharmaceuticals for $639 million. 5. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries will co-develop and co-market an investigational pain drug, fasinumab, that if approved could be a non-addictive alternative to opioids. The drug is currently in trials and being tested as a potential reliever for osteoarthritis and chronic lower back pain.

Health care and technology companies took some of the biggest losses while banks rose. Investors were indecisive as leaders of the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan prepared to meet, and stocks swung several times between gains and losses. The Dow rose as much as 131 points early on, then fell as much as 30 points in the afternoon. Banks, utility companies and machinery makers rose. Bond yields edged higher and the dollar weakened. Russ Koesterich, head of asset allocation with BlackRock’s Global Allocation Fund, said investors don’t expect the Fed to raise interest rates. However he said investors have more questions about the Bank of Japan’s plans. “They could decide to introduce more stimulus, but it could take a lot of different forms,” he said. “One of the questions ... is not only what will they do, but what would the market like to see?” While advancing stocks far outnumbered decliners, the Dow Jones industrial average dipped 3.63 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 18,120.17. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 0.04 points to 2,139.12. The Nasdaq composite fell 9.54 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,235.03. The Federal Reserve will meet Tuesday and announce its latest decision on interest rates the following day. Banks got a boost as some investors hoped that interest rates will rise, which would allow banks to make more money from lending. JPMorgan Chase rose 37 cents to $66.19 and Wells Fargo regained 58 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $46.01. Technology products distributor Tech Data jumped after it said it will buy the technology solutions business of Avnet for $2.6 billion in cash and stock. Tech Data says the deal will give it operations in 35 countries. Its stock rose $15.46, or 22.3 percent, to $84.80 and Avnet gained $2.68, or 6.8 percent, to $41.89. Meanwhile, network control company Infoblox agreed to be bought by Vista Equity Partners for $26.50 per share, or $1.51 billion. It surged $3.52, or 15.4 percent, to $26.35. Despite those gains, the broader technology sector gave up an early advance and finished mostly lower. Apple, which surged last week and reached its highest price this year, lost $1.34, or 1.2 percent, to $113.58 and Intel fell 51 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $37.16. Health care stocks also lagged the market. Merck fell 95 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $61.33 after rival Sanofi said it sued company. Sanofi says Merck infringed on patents protecting its insulin drug Lantus. Eye drug maker Regeneron Pharmaceuticals fell $5.80, or 1.4 percent, to $402.83. Sarepta Therapeutics soared $20.79, or 73.9 percent, to $48.94 after the Food and Drug Administration granted tentative approval to its drug Exondys 51, a treatment for a type of muscular dystrophy. The drug treats Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a rare and deadly inherited disease that causes muscle weakness and eventually the loss of all basic movement. It usually causes death by age 25. The FDA had hesitated to approve the drug because advisers said there was little evidence it worked. Its approval is based on a study of only 12 patients, and the FDA is ordering Sarepta to run a larger study. Isle of Capri Casinos agreed to be bought by Eldorado Resorts for $23 per share, or $950 million in cash and stock. Combined, the companies own 21 casinos and race tracks. Isle of Capri stock jumped $5.11, or 30.2 percent, to $22.04 while Eldorado Resorts stock lost 41 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $13.84. Health website operator WebMD slumped after it said CEO David Schlanger is leaving the company by mutual agreement. Schlanger is being replaced by President Steven Zatz, who is in charge of WebMD’s advertising and sponsorship business. WebMD fell $2.95, or 5.7 percent, to $49.02 and it is down 27 percent since May 25. General Motors gained 75 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $31.72 after an analyst said auto sales, which are at record highs, should remain strong for several years. Analyst Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley raised his rating on GM to “Overweight” and raised his price target to $37 a share from $29. Benchmark U.S. crude added 27 cents to $43.30 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 18 cents to $45.95 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 4 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $1.42 a gallon. Heating oil fell 1 cent to $1.39 a gallon. Natural gas retreated 1 cent to $2.93 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold rose $7.60 to $1,317.80 an ounce. Silver added 43 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $19.29 an ounce. Copper remained at $2.16 a pound. U.S. government bond prices slipped. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 1.71 percent from 1.69 percent. The dollar fell to 101.81 yen from 102.42 yen. The euro rose to $1.1178 from $1.1151. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares climbed 1.5 percent and the CAC-40 in France rose 1.4 percent. Germany’s DAX was 1 percent higher. South Korea’s Kospi added 0.8 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index rose 0.9 percent. Trading in Japan was closed for a holiday. Australia’s stock market suspended trading after a couple of hours due to technical glitches. The S&P/ASX 200 finished little changed. ——— AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay     Tags: percent, cents, stock, after, investors, Other stories from today: With economic outlook hazy, Fed likely to leave rates alone Wells Fargo CEO preparing to apologize to Senate committee Feds want to regulate drivers when the driver is the car     Print this Page  |  << Back   Return To Archives            Daily Journal Quick Poll   In six months, the economy will be ...

Bayer now expects annual peak sales of more than 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) for stroke prevention pill Xarelto, jointly sold with Johnson & Johnson, where it had previously seen about 3.5 billion. For the eye medicine Eylea, jointly developed with Regeneron, it now sees peak sales potential of more than 2.5 billion euros, up from at least 1.5 billion previously. Also underpinned by cancer drug Xofigo and pulmonary hypertension treatment Adempas, the group’s prescription drugs unit aims to increase earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), adjusted for special items, to 32-34 percent of sales in 2018, up from 30.1 percent last year. The smaller animal health unit could also slightly increase margins, Bayer said. In consumer health, previously boosted by the acquisition of brands from Merck & Co, it now sees sales adjusted for currency swings growing by between 4 and 5 percent by the end of 2018 and an adjusted EBITDA margin of about 25 percent, up from 24 percent in 2015. Bayer has “underestimated the country risk from Emerging Markets volatility”, the company said in presentation slides. It also cited “stronger business disruption than anticipated during the integration of Merck Consumer Care and Dihon in China”, referring to a Chinese non-prescription drugs unit it acquired in 2014. “2018 EBITDA guidance for Pharma and Animal Health may … offer some upside against consensus, though the consumer margin guidance may disappoint slightly,” Jefferies analysts said in a note to investors. Bayer shares were seen 1.5 percent higher in premarket trading at brokerage Lang & Schwarz, where the overall German market was seen little changed ahead of the official market open at 0700 GMT.

Teeter is as simple as it seems. It was filed this year by two hepatitis C patients against the state's Medicaid program to help the poor gain access to drugs such as Gilead Sciences Inc.'s $1,000-a-pill cure. But behind the team bringing the case is Gilead itself. While the drug giant isn't involved in the lawsuit, the company and its foundation have donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the researchers, lawyers, patient advocates and medical expert who have helped build the case. Gilead said its donations have nothing to do with the legal fight. If the plaintiffs prevail, however, Gilead and other drug companies stand to make billions because Washington's Medicaid program would be forced to cover expensive treatments -- and other states may be pressured to follow suit. VIDEOS TOP JOBS With the controversy swirling around high drug costs, the case in Washington comes as the pharmaceutical industry and some pharma-backed advocates are trying to shift the debate from price to the tight-fisted insurers and bureaucrats who are denying patients life-saving drugs. The Biotechnology Innovation Organization, an industry lobbying group, gave members talking points in June focusing on access to drugs over their price tags. Or, as Robert Greenwald said in a 2015 PowerPoint presentation on the new class of hepatitis C drugs put it: "Reframe the response. Shift the focus from cost to cure." The presentation sought to make people aware the disease has a cure, not just that it was costly to treat, said Greenwald. He runs the Harvard Law School center that's representing the Washington plaintiffs. It's also partially funded by Gilead and other drugmakers. The Washington case illustrates a dilemma some patient advocates face: Many have few funding options beyond pharmaceutical firms, putting them in a ticklish position when criticizing prices. Gilead is the hepatitis C market leader, but rivals including AbbVie and Merck & Co. contribute to some of the same groups. "We the payers need the advocates on our side to put pressure on either the manufacturers to bring the price down or on the federal government to help find some affordability solutions," said Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors. "But they are not going to do that if they are beholden to the pharmaceutical industry for money." Gilead said there wasn't a quid pro quo with its grant recipients and that none of its contributions were intended for litigation against Washington state. Amy Flood, a Gilead spokeswoman, said it wasn't surprising that some grant recipients are fighting restrictions on hepatitis C drugs, which she described as "questionable policy for medications that are cost-effective, save the health-care system money and cure patients of a deadly and debilitating disease." Gilead's drugs are less expensive than treatments, such as liver transplants, that may be needed if the disease progresses. Gilead rejects the "implication that providing funding for one project or activity translates to financing, influencing or endorsing everything an organization does," Flood said in an email. "Gilead's grant program is not a commercial strategy." Brook Baker, a law professor at Northeastern University in Boston focused on international access to medicine, called it "very cynical" of Gilead to be providing money to the players involved in a lawsuit that "benefits them financially in the name of patient access." "The real issue is, with the price as high as it is, it's a budget breaker," Baker said. "Gilead has priced this in a way to wring every penny out of the system that it can." Merck's donations are "an important way to advance our mutual objectives to improve health and advance patient care," spokeswoman Doris Li said in an email. Merck's policies ensure its grants aren't promotional or "provided to induce or reward prescription of our products." AbbVie declined to comment. Sovaldi debuted in 2013 and was the first reliable hepatitis C cure. It became one of the fastest-selling drugs in history despite its price: $84,000 for a 12-week course of treatment, the equivalent of $1,000 a pill. Even with discounts, it was so successful that profits for the Foster City, California-based drugmaker nearly quadrupled in 2014. Its successor, Harvoni, has a higher sticker price: $94,500. Today, Gilead boasts a market value of $104 billion, bigger than McDonald's. But the prices touched off a firestorm that engulfed the industry. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called out Gilead for criticism. A Senate investigation concluded "fostering broad, affordable access was not a key consideration in the process of setting the wholesale prices." There are more expensive drugs, but most of them treat rare disorders -- roughly 3.5 million Americans have hepatitis C, a slowly advancing liver virus that many contract from sharing needles. From 2012 to 2015 Gilead's lobbying budget more than doubled to about $3 million a year. That went to hepatitis C education and increasing drug access among government health programs, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. » Next page... 2 3 Single page   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Editorial: Time for Utah conservatives to stand against Breitbartism Students are stabbed at Utah school, but 'this was not retaliatory' Crews ready for first snow, urge residents to prep, too Rolly: Utah girl shunned by some in Mormon ward.

Posted 20 Sep 2016 13:55 Updated 20 Sep 2016 15:10 The logo of Bayer AG is pictured at the Bayer Healthcare subgroup production plant in Wuppertal, Germany February 24, 2014. REUTERS/Ina Fassbender/File Photo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A FRANKFURT: German drugmaker Bayer said its two best-selling drugs had a higher annual peak sales potential than previously targeted, after the agreed US$66 billion takeover of Monsanto stirred criticism it might neglect its pharmaceuticals business. Bayer now expects annual peak sales of more than 5 billion euros (US$5.6 billion) for stroke prevention pill Xarelto, jointly sold with Johnson & Johnson , where it had previously seen about 3.5 billion. For the eye medicine Eylea, jointly developed with Regeneron , it now sees peak sales potential of more than 2.5 billion euros, up from at least 1.5 billion previously. Also underpinned by cancer drug Xofigo and pulmonary hypertension treatment Adempas, the group's prescription drugs unit aims to increase earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), adjusted for special items, to 32-34 percent of sales in 2018, up from 30.1 percent last year. The smaller animal health unit could also slightly increase margins, Bayer said. In consumer health, previously boosted by the acquisition of brands from Merck & Co , it now sees sales adjusted for currency swings growing by between 4 and 5 percent by the end of 2018 and an adjusted EBITDA margin of about 25 percent, up from 24 percent in 2015. Bayer has "underestimated the country risk from Emerging Markets volatility", the company said in presentation slides. It also cited "stronger business disruption than anticipated during the integration of Merck Consumer Care and Dihon in China", referring to a Chinese non-prescription drugs unit it acquired in 2014. "2018 EBITDA guidance for Pharma and Animal Health may ... offer some upside against consensus, though the consumer margin guidance may disappoint slightly," Jefferies analysts said in a note to investors. Bayer shares were seen 1.5 percent higher in premarket trading at brokerage Lang & Schwarz, where the overall German market was seen little changed ahead of the official market open at 0700 GMT.

A successful corporate acquisition should increase cost savings, boost profits, and expand markets. Unfortunately, too many do just the opposite. By Ben Levisohn Biography Sept. 17, 2016 2:27 a.m. ET Like an Olympian attempting a perfect dive, a corporate acquisition should make as little splash as possible. Too often, though, companies act like a bunch of kids playing cannonball at the pool. Deal making has slowed this year—some $2.4 trillion worth of mergers has been announced globally, off last year’s $3.1 trillion at the same time in 2015—but it has hardly disappeared.

NEW YORK — U.S. stocks wobbled and finished mostly lower Monday as investors waited for central bank meetings in the United States and Japan. Health care and technology companies took some of the biggest losses while banks rose. Investors were indecisive as leaders of the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan prepared to meet, and stocks swung several times between gains and losses. The Dow rose as much as 131 points early on, then fell as much as 30 points in the afternoon. Banks, utility companies and machinery makers rose. Russ Koesterich, head of asset allocation with BlackRock's Global Allocation Fund, said investors don't expect the Fed to raise interest rates. However, he said investors have more questions about the Bank of Japan's plans. “They could decide to introduce more stimulus, but it could take a lot of different forms,” he said. “One of the questions ... is not only what will they do, but what would the market like to see?” While advancing stocks far outnumbered decliners, the Dow Jones industrial average dipped 3.63 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 18,120.17. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 0.04 of a point to 2,139.12. The Nasdaq composite fell 9.54 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,235.03. The Federal Reserve will meet Tuesday and announce its latest decision on interest rates the following day. Banks got a boost as some investors hoped that interest rates will rise, which would allow banks to make more money from lending. JPMorgan Chase rose 37 cents to $66.19 and Wells Fargo regained 58 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $46.01. Technology products distributor Tech Data jumped after it said it will buy the technology solutions business of Avnet for $2.6 billion in cash and stock. Meanwhile, network control company Infoblox agreed to be bought by Vista Equity Partners for $26.50 per share, or $1.51 billion. It surged $3.52, or 15.4 percent, to $26.35. Despite those gains, the broader technology sector gave up an early advance and finished mostly lower. Health care stocks also lagged the market. Merck fell 95 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $61.33 after rival Sanofi said it sued the company. Sanofi says Merck infringed on patents protecting its insulin drug Lantus. Eye drug maker Regeneron Pharmaceuticals fell $5.80, or 1.4 percent, to $402.83. Sarepta Therapeutics soared $20.79, or 73.9 percent, to $48.94 after the Food and Drug Administration granted tentative approval to its drug Exondys 51, a treatment for a type of muscular dystrophy. The drug treats Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a rare and deadly inherited disease that causes muscle weakness and eventually the loss of all basic movement. It usually causes death by age 25. The FDA had hesitated to approve the drug because advisers said there is little evidence it works. Its approval is based on a study of 12 patients, and the FDA is ordering Sarepta to run a larger study. Isle of Capri Casinos agreed to be bought by Eldorado Resorts for $23 per share, or $950 million in cash and stock. Combined, the companies own 21 casinos and race tracks. Isle of Capri stock jumped $5.11, or 30.2 percent, to $22.04 while Eldorado Resorts stock lost 41 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $13.84. General Motors gained 75 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $31.72 after an analyst said auto sales, which are at record highs, should remain strong for several years. Analyst Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley raised his rating on GM to “Overweight” and raised his price target to $37 a share from $29. U.S. government bond prices slipped. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 1.71 percent from 1.69 percent. The dollar fell to 101.81 yen from 102.42 yen. The euro rose to $1.1178 from $1.1151. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares climbed 1.5 percent and the CAC-40 in France rose 1.4 percent. Germany's DAX was 1 percent higher. South Korea's Kospi added 0.8 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 0.9 percent. Trading in Japan was closed for a holiday. Australia's stock market suspended trading after a couple of hours because of technical glitches. The S&P/ASX 200 finished little changed.

Infertility can transform from an acute, private distress into a harsh public stigma with complex and devastating consequences. With experts warning that infertility is a growing health problem, the crisis is chiefly culturally and socially created such that, even though it affects couples directly, it is the woman who bears the burden. An inability to have a child or to become pregnant can result in being greatly isolated, disinherited or assaulted. This may result in divorce or physical and psychological violence. Male causes Traditionally, infertility is often thought of as a female concern, but experts associated a third of cases to male problems, such as a low sperm count. Others include problems with the tubes carrying sperms, problems getting an erection, problems ejaculating, inflamed testes (orchitis) or a past bacterial infection that caused scarring and blocked tubes within the epididymis as it joins the vas. Other factors include having received medical treatment, such as drug treatment, radiotherapy or surgery, undescended testes or twisted testicles, genetic problems, diabetes and lifestyle factors, such as obesity or contact with chemicals or radiation. Recent research also confirm that male fertility declines with age, although the extent is not clear. The case of male infertility was brought to the limelight with the case of Jackline Mwende, who hails from Machakos county. Her husband chopped off her hands for failing to bear children after seven years of marriage, despite him being the root cause of the couple's inability to have children. Taita Taveta woman representative Joyce Lay, who visited Mwende in Machakos county, said infertility should never be a reason to separate, hurt or kill your partner. Lay has also come out publicly and opened up on a traumatising ordeal she underwent to become a parent by opting to use a surrogate mother. Lay revealed this during an interview on a local TV station. She recounted the trauma she suffered after going through surgery. “I went through a hysterectomy and lost my uterus. I had to get my baby through a surrogate mother, so I went through the IVF process,” she said. In-Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) is a process where you cannot conceive naturally and use a science-assisted procedure to carry your own baby, because you have complications with your womb or do not have a uterus. The embryo is transferred to another woman. Lay, the ambassador for ‘Merck More than a Mother’ in Kenya, said there are many options available to manage infertility. 'Merck More than a Mother' is an initiative that aims to define interventions to reduce the stigma and social suffering of infertile women. It endeavours to empower them and raise awareness about male infertility and the necessity for a team approach to family building among couples across the continent. Before the interview, Lay had delivered an emotional speech during a debate on the IVF Bill in Parliament introduced by Mbita MP Millie Odhiambo. Other causes According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), lower levels of development are thought to be associated with higher levels of non-genetic and preventable causes of infertility. For instance, poor nutrition, untreated sexually transmitted infections (STIs), unsafe abortion, consequences of infections caused by female genital mutilation (FGM) or child marriage, exposure to smoking, leaded petrol and other environmental pollutants can lead to infertility. A 10-year survey carried out in northern India, which studied the lives of 1,000 men, found that various lifestyle factors are major causes of decreasing sperm count. These include: tight clothing, hot tub dips and long visits to the sauna, intensive gardening and farming resulting in pesticide exposure and increased obesity rates. Studies have also shown that most men exposed to high temperature at their workplace — welders, dyers and blast furnace workers, and cement and steel factory workers — are more prone to infertility. This is because the additional environmental heat increases the temperature of the scrotum, causing a negative effect on sperm production.

Still reeling from EpiPen scandal, nurse questions new drug’s sky-high cost Lee Rood , lrood@dmreg.com 6:30 p.m. CDT September 21, 2016 Patricia Karraker suffers from a rare condition. But one prescription that could help her can cost more than $11,000. Buy Photo Patricia Karraker sits with her daughter, Susan Piper. Karraker has a rare condition affecting her blood pressure and can't get approved for the drug to treat it because of the drug's high cost. (Photo: Lee Rood/The Register)Buy Photo Patricia Karraker suffers from a rare condition that causes her blood pressure to drop precipitously when she sits up or stands. It falls so fast, she can pass out — and that’s been happening more and more often. She's been hospitalized twice in the past month. “It’s awful. I can’t function,” the 82-year-old says. “I’m not productive, and I am a woman who is used to being productive.” Last week, three Iowa Clinic doctors treating Karraker at Methodist West Hospital in West Des Moines wanted to try Northera, a drug approved for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension by the FDA two years ago. But Susan Piper, Karraker’s daughter and who happens to be a nurse and the wife of a neurosurgeon, said she was told a top Unity Point Health official rejected the drug because of its high cost. Pharmacies sell 180-count 300 mg capsules of the drug for around $11,218 to $11,535 — and that's with discount coupons. “I could put her up in Buckingham Palace for that,” Piper said. Karraker has largely outlived her retirement savings, so she lives now with Piper, 52, and her son-in-law in West Des Moines. The Pipers help with the costs of her medications because she doesn’t have supplemental prescription drug insurance. Piper wrote the Reader’s Watchdog, wanting to know why a life-saving drug costs so much. She feared her mother would be put at risk if she couldn't get the drug before she was released. “Society needs to understand that these costs don't begin and end with EpiPen,” she wrote. Price gouging or drug development? We have Martin Shkreli, the hedge fund manager turned drug company CEO, to thank for fanning the recent national outrage over prescription price gouging. Americans have been fuming ever since Turing Pharmaceuticals obtained exclusive rights to Daraprim, the drug used to treat HIV and AIDS patients, and hiked prices 5,000 percent. Next came the skyrocketing price of EpiPen, a branded device that quickly delivers epinephrine, a cheap and commonly available chemical compound. For years, it's helped people with life-threatening allergies, such as bee or wasp stings. After pharma giant Mylan bought EpiPen, the company began to quietly raise prices from less than $100 in 2009 to around $600 this year. Those increases started at 10 percent from 2010 to 2013, then jumped to 15 percent beginning in 2014, according to Time magazine. USA TODAY Mylan CEO defends price boosts for lifesaving EpiPen The reason the company could get away with those bumps: One generic alternative didn't pass muster with the FDA and another competitor, Auvi-Q, was recalled. After all the public backlash this year, Mylan rolled out a generic two-pack of EpiPen for commercially insured patients for $300. And it announced other measures to help make the drug appear more accessible. But critics are still howling that consumers and insurers are being forced to pay too much because the maker has a de facto corner on the market. Price hikes reasons differ But what happened with Daraprim or EpiPen is different than what’s happening with Northera right now. The development costs of the first two drugs were covered years ago. Northera is an orphan drug, which means it treats a rare disease that affects fewer than 200,000 Americans. As such, it qualifies for incentives under the Orphan Drug Act, including a minimum of seven years of market exclusivity for its manufacturer. The Orphan Drug Act of 1983 encouraged drug manufacturers to develop new drugs for such rare disorders, and it is widely considered a success. Only 10 drugs had been approved to treat a rare disease before its passage. By the end of 2015, over 450 additional new ones had been approved, according new research released this year. But specialty drug companies also have been taking advantage of the law, increasing prices dramatically. For them, the beauty is that the high cost is usually covered by public or private insurers because they are the only drugs available. USA TODAY Under fire, Mylan to offer generic EpiPen for 50% less Denmark-based Lundbeck, which acquired Northera in the U.S., has been accused of price gouging after cornering a market. Example: When Merck owned a drug used to treat a heart condition in premature infants called Indocin IV, it charged $77.77 per treatment. Lundbeck bought the U.S. rights to that drug in 2005. Then it acquired rights to a similar drug called NeoProfen in 2006. Immediately after, the company raised the price to Indocin IV to about $500 a vial. When the company launched NeoProfen, it set the price at about $483 per vial. The result was a lawsuit by the Federal Trade Commission and Minnesota for violations of anti-monopoly laws. But the FTC lost because it didn’t prove the two drugs were in direct competition. This month, the General Court of the European Union upheld an antitrust fine imposed against Lundbeck and several other drug makers for allegedly conspiring to delay the availability of a lower-cost generic version of an antidepressant. The so-called pay-to-delay deal violated the EU’s anti-competition regulations. Lundbeck was ordered to pay the bulk of the fine, or about $105 million. But Lundbeck can make the case that research and development of Northera in the U.S. is still costing millions. In 2012, health regulators recommended Northera — first used in Japan — not be approved in the U.S. because of safety concerns. But in 2014, Chelsea Therapeutics won approval for the short-term relief of symptoms like Karraker experiences. Lundbeck, a company that has expertise in commercializing such drugs, bought Chelsea. The company had to commit to investing millions more in clinical trials for the FDA's approval. Company: We'll work with patients Sally Benjamin Young, vice president for public affairs for Lundbeck, says the drug is currently being used by only about 5,000 people in the U.S. Most pay less than $100 a month after insurance, she said. The company also invests in services and support for families, like the Northera Support Center. “If they identify coverage gaps, they would work with patients and the family,” Young said of the center. “We want to make sure the burden isn’t on the patient, so they can get the treatment they need.” Young said Lundbeck is different than other companies like Mylan, focusing its research and development on hard-to-treat central nervous system disorders such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, major depression and schizophrenia. Those drugs generally cost $100 million more than other drugs to test and bring to market, while their chances of success are considerably lower, she said. In the U.S., Northera carries a black-box warning to physicians indicating its use might increase the risk of hypertension while lying down. Dr. Kevin Cunningham, Karraker's primary physician, declined to comment. But this week, he opted against Northera for fear the drug might push Karraker's blood pressure too high, Piper said, he feared her mother might have a stroke. Instead, he decided to increase her dosage of her cortisol drug and recommended she be admitted to a skilled nursing facility for the time being. “I feel better about this as an option,” Piper said. “Last week, they told me she didn’t meet criteria for skilled care.” Piper said people still need to question why drugs cost so much. “Even though we decided not to give this to my mom, it will come up for someone else. Medication costs in this country are nuts.” Young said she believes the doctor knows what's best for Karraker. But if it's decided she does need Northera again, she said she would personally help her family get assistance. 51 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/2dkGAoO TOP VIDEOS How good are Iowa's rivers?

The VA requires drug makers offer the agency a discount amounting to 24 percent off a drug's average price.  The Yes on 61 campaign is facing off with opponents that include the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and drug makers, including Pfizer, Merck and Gilead. They argue that passage of the ballot initiative would result in higher prescription drug costs for the state and would reduce patient access to medications.  Salazar says says so far, the yes campaign has raised about $10 million, but says that budget will be small compared to the drug makers' campaign war chest. "We understand the other side is going to spend tens of millions of dollars on this campaign," he says,  adding that community-support for the measure will be key. "We’re not going to be able to bombard the airwaves like the pharmaceutical industry is going to, so we have to get our message across people-to-people. This is going to be a real grassroots effort - a little bit like David and Goliath."  Other supporters of the initiative, beyond Sen. Bernie Sanders, include the California Nurses Association, AARP, Inc., VoteVets and the Urban League, he said. A recent USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll shows 66 percent of California voters are in favor of the initiative, 23 percent are opposed to it, and 12 percent are undecided.

Health care and household goods companies led the way while energy companies slipped. Major market indexes were higher all day, but returned most of those gains at the close of trading. They rose just enough cancel out Monday’s small losses. Drug companies helped health care stocks make some modest gains, while Exxon Mobil fell on reports it’s being investigated by securities regulators. Bond yields slipped and the dollar was little changed as investors waited decisions from the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan. Since investors doubt the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates Wednesday, they may focus instead on the Fed’s statement and a press conference led by Fed Chair Janet Yellen. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 9.79 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,129.96. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index added 0.64 points to 2,139.76. The Nasdaq composite picked up 6.33 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,241.35. On the New York Stock Exchange, more stocks fell than rose. That was the reverse of Monday, when major indexes fell but more stocks were up than down. Tuesday was the start of two-day meetings for the Fed and Bank of Japan. While investors didn’t expect an increase in U.S. interest rates, the Japanese central bank is expected to take new steps to boost the nation’s ailing economy. That could include an increase in its stimulus program or a further cut in the deposit rate as a way to encourage banks to lend money. Gilead Sciences gained $2.79, or 3.5 percent, to $81.78 after the hepatitis C drugmaker completed a $5 billion debt offering. Gilead said it may use the cash to make a deal, and Jefferies & Co. analyst Brian Abrahams said he thinks the company is getting close to at least one acquisition. Elsewhere, Merck rose 61 cents, or 1 percent, to $61.94. Ascena Retail Group, the parent of Ann Taylor, Lane Bryant and Dress Barn, dropped to a six-year low after the company reported weak quarterly results and gave a forecast that fell short of investor expectations. Ascena bought Ann Taylor a year ago and also struggled with discounts from competitors and shaky demand. Its stock lost $2.43, or 29.9 percent, to $5.69. Allergan announced yet another acquisition as it agreed to buy Tobira Therapeutics. Tobira is studying drugs that treat symptoms of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, a disease that triggers inflammation that can lead to cirrhosis, cancer and liver failure. The Commerce Department said the pace of home construction slowed down in August as fewer homes were built in the South.

LATEST MEDICAL NEWS Cardiology cme/ce Cangrelor Proves Worth in Both Stable Angina and ACS CHAMPION PHOENIX analysis finds benefit for major events MedpageToday savesaved register today Earn Free CME Credits by reading the latest medical news in your specialty.sign up by Nicole Lou Reporter, MedPage Today/CRTonline.org September 20, 2016 Action Points Note that this secondary analysis of a clinical trial found that the platelet inhibitor cangrelor was superior to placebo in terms of preventing periprocedural complications in patients with UA and ACS undergoing PCI. Be aware that this effect did not translate into better patient survival. Patients getting cangrelor (Kengreal) before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) had good outcomes whether they had stable angina or acute coronary syndrome (ACS), according to a sub-analysis of CHAMPION PHOENIX in which the drug was compared to clopidogrel (Plavix). Rates of a composite endpoint of death, myocardial infarction (MI), ischemia-driven revascularization, and stent thrombosis at 48 hours were lower for patients receiving cangrelor who had stable angina (5.7% versus 6.8% for clopidogrel, OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.67-1.01) as well as in those with ACS (3.3% versus 4.6%, OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.96). Similarly, cangrelor trended towards lower rates of stent thrombosis alone in both patients with stable angina (0.5% versus 0.9%, OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30-1.01) and those with ACS (1.3% versus 2.0%, OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.42-1.06), reported P. Gabriel Steg, MD, of Hôpital Bichat in Paris, and colleagues in JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions. "The benefits and risks of cangrelor were consistent in patients with stable angina and ACS," they concluded. "Regardless of the setting, primary PCI for ST-elevation MI, non-ST-elevation ACS, or elective PCI for stable angina, cangrelor provides added flexibility to clinicians by ensuring an immediate, consistent, and reversible antiplatelet effect and obviating the need to commit to pretreatment." "Cangrelor as compared with clopidogrel given at the time of PCI consistently reduced the risk of periprocedural ischemic events in both ACS and stable angina patients. These results are mostly driven by a decrease in periprocedural MI, but the key secondary endpoint of stent thrombosis was also reduced in both groups." Cangrelor and clopidogrel were about equal in terms of moderate or severe bleeding -- per Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries definitions: Stable angina: 0.5% cangrelor versus 0.3% clopidogrel, OR 1.49, 95% CI 0.67-3.33 ACS: 0.7% versus 0.4%, OR 1.79, 95% CI 0.79-4.07 Moreover, "cangrelor has not shown any insinuation of an effect on mortality linked to PCI in comparison with clopidogrel, despite a significant number of patients enrolled," according to Gilles Montalescot, MD, PhD, of Pitié-Salpêtrière University Hospital in Paris, and two colleagues representing the ACTION Study Group. "There is a strong argument in favor of cangrelor to better control the troponin leak following PCI but no evidence that the drug can improve survival of the patients," they wrote in an accompanying editorial. "The seductive antiplatelet drug has shown so far, to fix the troponin leak but not the life of the patients." Even so, Montalescot's group commented that cangrelor reduces stent thrombosis -- and "because of its intravenous formulation and fast onset of action, is the only P2Y12 antagonist adapted to emergency and high-risk situations when patients cannot swallow or absorb other P2Y12 antagonist pills." "Shock patients, cardiac arrest patients, and ventilated patients with ongoing ST-segment elevation MI are those who need life-saving drugs at the time of PCI. Unfortunately, they are also those who were excluded from the three CHAMPION trials and those the company refused to evaluate so far in new studies," they continued. "Considering the safety hazard of pre-treatment with oral P2Y12 antagonists in stable CAD and non-ST-segment elevation-ACS patients, and considering the ease of use and good safety profile of cangrelor, the drug could at least fix the life of the interventional cardiologist!" Steg's modified intention-to-treat population of CHAMPION PHOENIX included 6,358 patients with stable angina and 4,584 with an acute coronary syndrome. Patients were randomized to cangrelor or clopidogrel before PCI. ACS patients tended to be younger and were more likely to smoke and be men. Though they had more multivessel disease, they had less prior history of MI, peripheral artery disease, heart failure, diabetes, previous PCI, or coronary artery bypass grafting than their peers with stable angina. In addition, the ACS group was more likely to undergo femoral access and receive clopidogrel on or before PCI; the stable angina cohort received more drug-eluting stents, however. The present CHAMPION PHOENIX substudy was not as well-powered as the main analysis, Steg's group acknowledged, adding that periprocedural myocardial infarction was likely underestimated due to the difficulty in discerning events. "Intriguingly, the rate of ischemic events is higher in the stable coronary artery disease (CAD) population than in the ACS patients (6.3% versus 3.9%)," Montalescot and colleagues noted. "Obviously, it does not mean that stable CAD patients have a worse prognosis than ACS patients. This disconnect finds its explanation in the definitions used to adjudicate ischemic events .... The definitions of periprocedural MI were not the same for ACS and stable CAD patients." "The safety profile of cangrelor is reassuring, although the safety profile of the CHAMPION PHOENIX trial population is so low that any difference would be difficult to detect," the editorialists added. "In addition to the selection of patients, the delayed administration of clopidogrel in both groups may partly explain the unusually low bleeding event rates observed in the CHAMPION PHOENIX trial." Steg disclosed having relationships with Amarin, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Boehringer-Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers Squibb, CSL-Behring, Daiichi-Sankyo, GlaxoSmithKline, Janssen, Lilly, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, Regeneron, Roche, Sanofi, Servier, The Medicines Company; and owning stock from Aterovax.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) FILE - In this Oct. 8, 2014, file photo, people walk to work on Wall Street beneath a statue of George Washington, in New York. Global stock markets traded with a positive bias Tuesday, Sept. 20, 2016, a day ahead of policy statements from the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan that could go a long way to driving sentiment over the rest of the year. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York • U.S. stocks inched higher Tuesday in another cautious day of trading as investors kept an eye on central banks in the U.S. and Japan. Health care and household goods companies led the way while energy companies slipped. Major market indexes were higher all day, but returned most of those gains at the close of trading. They rose just enough cancel out Monday's small losses. Drug companies helped health care stocks make some modest gains, while Exxon Mobil fell on reports it's being investigated by securities regulators. Bond yields slipped and the dollar was little changed as investors waited decisions from the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Since investors doubt the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates Wednesday, they may focus instead on the Fed's statement and a press conference led by Fed Chair Janet Yellen. "The Fed, until they raise rates, are going to be the primary focus of the markets," said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. "The only reason people may take their eye off of that is the election." The Dow Jones industrial average gained 9.79 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,129.96. The Standard & Poor's 500 index added 0.64 points to 2,139.76. The Nasdaq composite picked up 6.33 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,241.35. On the New York Stock Exchange, more stocks fell than rose. That was the reverse of Monday, when major indexes fell but more stocks were up than down. Tuesday was the start of two-day meetings for the Fed and Bank of Japan. While investors didn't expect an increase in U.S. interest rates, the Japanese central bank is expected to take new steps to boost the nation's ailing economy. That could include an increase in its stimulus program or a further cut in the deposit rate as a way to encourage banks to lend money. Gilead Sciences gained $2.79, or 3.5 percent, to $81.78 after the hepatitis C drugmaker completed a $5 billion debt offering. Gilead said it may use the cash to make a deal, and Jefferies & Co. analyst Brian Abrahams said he thinks the company is getting close to at least one acquisition. Elsewhere, Merck rose 61 cents, or 1 percent, to $61.94. Ascena Retail Group, the parent of Ann Taylor, Lane Bryant and Dress Barn, dropped to a six-year low after the company reported weak quarterly results and gave a forecast that fell short of investor expectations. Ascena bought Ann Taylor a year ago and also struggled with discounts from competitors and shaky demand. Its stock lost $2.43, or 29.9 percent, to $5.69. Allergan, the maker of Botox, announced yet another acquisition as it agreed to buy Tobira Therapeutics. Tobira is studying drugs that treat symptoms of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, a disease that triggers inflammation that can lead to cirrhosis, cancer and liver failure. Tobira stock has tumbled this year after it reported mixed results from a mid-stage trial of one of its drugs. The shares finished at $4.74 on Monday, but Allergan agreed to pay $28.35 per share upfront, and could pay another $49.84 if Tobira's drugs succeed in clinical testing, win regulatory approved, and meet sales targets. Tobira shares skyrocketed to $38.91 and Allergan fell $6.62, or 2.7 percent, to $238.67. The Commerce Department said the pace of home construction slowed down in August as fewer homes were built in the South. Monthly housing figures can be volatile and housing starts have grown this year, but the report hurt shares of homebuilders. PulteGroup gave up 58 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $19.29 and Lennar, which reported strong quarterly results, shed $1.59, or 3.5 percent, to $43.50. Hotel chains Marriott and Starwood climbed after regulators in China approved the $14.41 billion deal that will bring them together to create the world's largest hotel chain. Marriott, which is buying Starwood, said it expects to complete the deal Friday. Its stock added $1.60, or 2.3 percent, to $69.94 and Starwood rose $1.81, or 2.4 percent, to $76.90. Royal Caribbean Cruises added $2.93, or 4.5 percent, to $68.41 after the company raised its quarterly dividend to 48 cents from 37.5 cents. » Next page...

This small, flexible, plastic T-shaped intrauterine device (IUD) is not very different from others used around the world. After being placed in the uterus, it releases continuously low dosages of levonorgestrel — a progestogen — providing effective birth control for up to five years. After removal, women rapidly return to their natural fertility levels. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the device is almost as effective as sterilization and more successful in preventing pregnancy than pills and patches. Related Link: Sexual Health Month: Carafem Applauds Latest Customized Birth Control Options The long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) device will be available in the United States as of next month and is expected to take market share from other IUDs like Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (ADR) (NYSE: TEVA)’s copper IUD, Paragard. However, its sales could also cannibalize those of other Bayer hormonal IUDs like Mirena and Skyla. For women looking for different options available in the United States, there’s Allergan plc Ordinary Shares(NYSE: AGN)’s Liletta, which lasts up the three years, and Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK)’s vaginal ring, NuvaRing, which needs to be changed with each menstrual cycle — removed after 21 days with a new ring reinserted seven days after that.

This is part of the of the WHO campaign and this undertaking by Indian companies coincides with a high-level meeting on antimicrobial resistance as part of the UN General Assembly in New York. According to the WHO, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) threatens the effective prevention and treatment of an ever-increasing range of infections caused by bacteria, parasites, viruses and fungi. It has posed a danger to the treatment of HIV. Globally, 4,80,000 people develop multi-drug resistant TB each year, and drug resistance is starting to complicate the fight against HIV and malaria, it says. The WHO also points out that the cost of health care for patients with resistant infections is higher than care for patients with non-resistant infections due to longer duration of illness, additional tests and use of more expensive drugs. Earlier this year Bloomberg reported that 85 companies including GlaxoSmithKline and Merck in the pharmaceutical, diagnostic, biotech and generic sectors, along with nine industry associations signed The Declaration on Combating Antimicrobial Resistance, announced at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. They were part of a large group of health-care companies that “would accelerate the development of drugs and diagnostics for “superbug” infections, trying to come up with a viable commercial model as an increasing number of bacteria become resistant to common antibiotics.” The other companies among the 13 that have signed up to the scheme include leaders in both branded and generic drug production like Merck, Novartis, Allergan and Indian drug makers Cipla and Wockhardt.

"Following" : "Follow"}} September 20, 2016 9:13am   Comments Share: Related BMY Can Trump Make Your Portfolio Great Again? The Election Can't Come Soon Enough For Biotechs Aimed at driving shareholder value, uniQure shakes up business (Seeking Alpha) Expectations are for an “underwhelming subgroup analysis” when the CheckMate-026 trial is presented at the forthcoming ESMO conference, Citi’s Andrew Baum said in a report. He maintained a Buy rating on Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE: BMY), while reducing the price target from $75 to $70. Citi’s companion report named ‘Divining the Future Post CHECKMATE-026’ highlights multiple possibilities for IO market share capture in the large NSCLC lung cancer segment. The report also highlights low expectations for the CheckMate-026 PD-L1 subgroup analysis at ESMO, which is scheduled from October 7 to October 11, analyst Baum mentioned. Market Share Baum noted that the base case forecasts assumed that even if PDx/CTL4 combination data is compelling, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) would retain at least 50 percent of “the disproportionately valuable high expressor market given its anticipated superlative efficacy, low toxicity and financial expense.” The PDx/CTL4 of Bristol-Myers and AstraZeneca plc (ADR) (NYSE: AZN) is assumed to equally share half of the NSCLC market in mid-stratum PD-L1 expressors. The smaller $700 million market, comprising of about 25 percent of patients with low PD-L1 expressing tumors, is assumed to be shared by Merck, Roche Holding Ltd. (OTCMKTS: RHHBY), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Bristol-Myers, the analyst added. Why Buy BMY? “Despite the earnings downgrades and the cautionary comments over near-term news flow, we continue to view BMY as undervalued on the premise that BMY’s Opdivo and Yervoy combination together with AZN durva/ tremi combination will become the gold standard first line therapy for NSCLC in the significantly majority of patients,” Baum commented.

The industry announcement coincides with a high-level meeting on antimicrobial resistance as part of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Companies that have signed up to the scheme include leaders in both branded and generic drug production, including Pfizer , Merck, Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline and Allergan, as well as Indian drugmakers Cipla and Wockhardt. The group will work with independent experts to set new factory standards and review supply chains to ensure antibiotic waste does not enter waterways, where it can lead to the breeding of superbugs. Efforts to prevent overuse of antibiotics will involve a review of promotional activities and the implementation, by 2020, of concrete measures such as the removal of incentives to sell the drugs in larger volumes. Though the problem of drug-resistant bacteria has been a feature of medicine since the discovery of penicillin in 1928, it has grown in recent years with the emergence of infections resistant to multiple drugs, such as MRSA.

That’s probably why Irishman Prof William Campbell was asked to sell his. What’s the biggest difference between a scientist who has landed a Nobel Prize for their decades of work, and one who hasn’t? The former, it seems, can’t retire. “Well, life has changed dramatically,” said Prof William Campbell, Ireland’s first Nobel Prize winner for physiology or medicine, landing the accolade late last year. “I was retired before. Now I’m not.” The 86-year-old’s work led to the development of a drug called Avermectin, which has seen the creation of derivatives that have “radically lowered the incidence of river blindness and lymphatic filariasis”, according to the Nobel Foundation. ‘I keep my Nobel Prize in a locked drawer, not in a bank. The way I see it, if I have friends around I want to be able to show it off to them.’ PROF WILLIAM CAMPBELL Golden touch Now, with a big chunk of solid gold to his name, finding a place to store it is Campbell’s latest concern. Too valuable to leave out on the mantelpiece, instead he keeps it locked up, away from prying eyes and sticky fingers. “It’s safe, but I won’t tell you where it’s locked away!” the scientist, originally from Donegal, said to Siliconrepublic.com. The Nobel Prize medal, front and back. Image: The Nobel Foundation/Lovisa Engblom The medal needs to be insured, given the value of the gold, so some winners have gone on to sell their prize. Others, according to Campbell, keep it in a safe in a bank – but where’s the fun in that? “You cannot keep it on your mantelpiece the way you might expect,” he said. “It’s too valuable. It’s big, pure gold. But not just that, it has its associations and meaning and connection as well. “I keep it in a locked drawer. The way I see it, if I have friends around I want to be able to show it off.” Buy and sell Amazingly, Campbell has already been approached by people interested in auctioning off the medal, painting a picture of an odd industry that has sprung up in the shadows of the Nobel Foundation’s showpiece annual event. He has no interest in getting rid of it, not after all his hard work. Campbell shared his award with Satoshi Ōmura, with their discovery dating all the way back to 1975, making it 40 years waiting for the ultimate recognition. Campbell isn’t sure why it took so long for a prize of such esteem to land on his lap, though he suggests bureaucracy could have gone against him all of this time. “It may have been because we were part of a team and you can’t award a Nobel Prize for science to any more than three people. Perhaps they were just trying to work it out,” he said. Announcement of the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine http://t.co/Wj73oAPVmI — The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) October 5, 2015 Storied past Campbell graduated from Trinity College Dublin in 1952, and a chance meeting between his professor and a colleague in University of Wisconsin–Madison helped set him on his path. Seeking a suggestion of a student who would best fit a place in Madison, Campbell’s name was put forward by his professor, with the Irishman soon crossing the Atlantic. After five years at Madison, Campbell graduated and, once again, a chance meeting between his professor and a colleague saw the Irishman land a job at Merck, where he stayed until 1990. It was here that Avermectin was developed, on the back of years of studying roundworms and their role in spreading the disease known as river blindness. “My interest in biology was always about parasites, parasites of all kinds,” he said. “Especially parasitic worms. Their importance in causing disease is clear.” For sheer numbers of people and domestic animals infected, studying roundworms was Campbell’s pick. “I worked on this for 17 years in total, before my first retirement,” he said.

Taking time to visit some family in Donegal, where his brother and sister still reside, Campbell is also on hand to officially open IT Sligo’s new Aurivo Auditorium. Now living in Massachusetts in the US, Campbell has two daughters and a son (none of whom followed him into the biology field), with three of his five grandchildren attending his talk tomorrow. Ireland’s 11th Nobel Prize winner, and the first in a scientific field since Ernest Walton’s work with atoms gained him recognition in 1951, Campbell isn’t sure why so few from this country receive the accolade. It’s not the sort of thing that you kind of plan for, he said, calling it “foolish” to aim specifically for the top prize. Luck of the Irish “There’s a tremendous amount of luck involved. Not just in connection with the prize, but in your career too. Your colleagues, their work, or even the meetings between people that set you on your way,” he said. Campbell and Ōmura’s Avermectin discovery is ongoing, with the drug “showing efficacy against an expanding number of other parasitic diseases”, according to the Nobel Prize organisers. In recent years, Campbell has become a research fellow emeritus at Drew University in the US, with transatlantic trips to open new courses, or for interview requests and other responsibilities meaning the 86-year-old’s work-life balance is skewing back towards the days of his youth. Still, as a Nobel Prize-winning celebrity, he’d probably not have it any other way.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Find Company: 23abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz Out-licensing yes, but with a more ‘mature’ approach, says Glenn Saldanha PT Jyothi Datta   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet Glenn Saldanha, Chairman and Managing Director, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals -- Paul Noronha Mumbai, Sept 20:   Glenn Saldanha does not believe that Glenmark has fallen silent on the licensing front. The next 12 to 18 months will see the company venture into out-licensing pacts with global partners to develop prospective drugs from the Glenmark stable, says Saldanha, Chairman and Managing Director. Only this time, the pacts will be approached with more “maturity”, as opposed to “doing deals for the next big cheque,” he says, reflecting on the company’s evolving strategy. “It’s more a timing issue. We’ve not slowed down in terms of work ….it’s just that we’ve been building up the pipeline,” he says, optimistic about their BEAT antibody technology platform. (The technology facilitates efficient development and manufacture of antibodies with dual specificities.) “To build a platform technology, to build capabilities, it has taken us some time to get there. But now we are at a very different place as far as research goes,” he says, explaining the perceived silence from a company that was once seen as being ahead of the pack in outlicensing products. “If I look back at our evolution, up to 2011 we were very aggressive in outlicensing. We cut seven licensing deals up to 2008…then 2010 and 11 also we did these two deals with Sanofi,” he recalls. More recently Glenmark said its contract with Sanofi (who was testing Glenmark’s GBR 900 for treating multiple sclerosis) had been terminated and Glenmark was now open to scout for new partners to relicense GBR 500, a monoclonal antibody. Without getting into details on products expected to be first off the out-licensing block, he points to oncology and immunology as sought after segments. Zetia, coming soon Another critical event on Glenmark’s radar comes up in December 2016, when the company will be able to sell its generically similar version of cholesterol-lowering drug Zetia in the US. Glenmark had settled a patent case with innovator Merck & Co on this blockbuster drug and is expected to get a period of exclusive sales on the drug. Zetia would contribute to Glenmark’s revenues into next year, says Saldanha, indicating that in the post-Zetia environment they could look at making some “bolt on” acquisitions, but nothing “transformational”. He was responding to a query on his counterparts including Sun Pharma, Lupin and Cipla going after massive acquisitions in India and overseas. “We defined our future based on products and research. ..We are at a point where we are saying that you had rather spend incremental monies on developing products rather than going and buying companies. ..that’s our perspective on acquisitions at least in the near term.” says Saldanha. The goal, he adds, is to become an innovations-led company. “That’s the strategic direction and that’s where we are placing all our bets even today.” Explaining the company’s 2014 decision to merge its speciality and generics arms, about seven years after it had demerged them (2007), he said the plan was to replicate a model that was similar to the Novartis – Sandoz model – running a generic and innovative company separately. Later though, companies changed strategy and were operating across the value chain. “The whole landscape has changed very dramatically,” he says, explaining their decision to operate on a geographic model that gives country heads greater flexibility to work across lines of businesses as opposed to being limited to a specific vertical. With the Zetia launch on the calendar, Glenmark is looking to end the year with revenues of about Rs 9,500 crore. The company currently has a debt of Rs 3,200 crore. But the management expects cash revenues from Zetia to address part of the debt repayment, as would its other measures, including rejigging the debt portfolio and equity infusion by Temasek (Singapore government’s investment arm), last year. jyothi.datta@thehindu.co.in (This article was published on September 20, 2016) Related NEWS Glenmark gets USFDA nod for skin lesion treatment gel Glenmark gets FDA nod for skin ointment Glenmark Pharma: A potent pill Companies  »  Glenmark Pharmaceutical Limited Quotes Snapshot Company Background Board of Directors Balance Sheet Profit & Loss Quarterly Results Financial Ratios Share Holding Pattern Score Board MF Holdings News Get more of your favourite news delivered to your inbox SEND MY NEWS Please enter your email.

Gluck, and Gregory Curfman September 19, 2016 October 20 Update In our post below, we discussed the political and empirical obstacles to a congressional repeal of the ban on Medicare’s negotiating on prescription drugs. As an example of a pilot project that could generate data and be initiated without congressional action, we referenced CMS’s proposed pilot on value-based drug purchasing in Medicare Part B. (While most prescription drugs covered by Medicare are managed in Part D, certain drugs, such as those administered via infusion by physicians, are managed in Part B.) Recent events prove our point about the extremely complex and obstructive politics of drug-pricing reform. The Part B pilot has continued to receive significant backlash funded by the pharmaceutical industry and has resulted in increased Congressional scrutiny of CMMI’s activities. House Republicans have even introduced a bill (H.R. 5122) to prohibit further action on the proposed Part B pilot, even though CBO estimates that blocking the project would cost $395 million in direct spending over the next 10 years. However, H.R. 5122 is unlikely to pass, in which case CMS will likely move forward with a narrower but potentially transformative proposal on Part B drug prices. Action on Part D will probably follow a similar pattern and will require pilots that over time build the kind of strong evidence for value-based drug pricing or other reforms that will finally bust the gridlock. Original Post Despite this election season’s divisiveness, both major parties’ presidential candidates have embraced the idea of authorizing Medicare Part D to negotiate directly with drug companies to set prescription drug prices. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), which established Medicare Part D, included a ban on such negotiation. In theory, if the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) could negotiate with pharmaceutical companies, the agency could leverage its purchasing power to pay less for drugs. The idea has received considerable media attention over the past few months and has broad public support, reflected in a recent poll showing 87 percent of Americans have a favorable view of the idea. Nevertheless, if history is any guide, politics may prevent a full repeal of the ban. It took almost 40 years to add a prescription-drug benefit to Medicare — a fact that may be surprising given how much seniors spend on pharmaceuticals. A coalition of stakeholders, including the pharmaceutical industry, helped defeat President Bill Clinton’s failed effort at health reform, and President Obama is said to have learned from that experience. President Obama secured the support of the drug industry early in the process of enacting the Affordable Care Act (ACA), so it may not be a surprise that the ACA does not do much to address drug pricing. The political process has continued to stymie more recent efforts to make even modest changes in this direction. The candidates’ promises to repeal the ban may therefore be difficult to keep. Moreover, even if a repeal were possible, it is uncertain whether repealing the ban would be effective in lowering spending on Part D drugs. Despite the idea’s widespread support and the debate it has spurred among health policy analysts, because the proposal is untested, evidence of its efficacy is limited. This post sets out some of the political and legal history of the ban in order to explain why, once the high-minded talk of election season concludes, repeal may be unrealistic, or even unwise. We conclude with some ideas for proceeding in a more incremental and evidence-based fashion — a tried and true process of achieving health reform in the face of entrenched interests. The Political and Legal History Behind the Ban on Negotiating Drug Prices Allowing Part D to negotiate drug prices is not a new idea: President Obama supported the repeal during his 2008 campaign and has included versions of the proposal in multiple budgets. Meanwhile, other government programs that purchase drugs have been able to lower drug costs through a variety of tactics. Medicaid prices are set by law at the lower end of a discounted price or the lowest price anyone is able to negotiate. The VA negotiates prices, receives mandatory rebates, and maintains a National Drug Formulary. So why doesn’t Medicare have the ability to control its drug costs? The short answer is politics. As noted above, from its creation and through Bill Clinton’s presidency, Medicare lacked a prescription-drug benefit. It was not until 2003, under President George W. Bush, that Congress added the Part D benefit, through which Medicare pays for seniors’ prescription drugs. The enactment followed a controversial House roll call vote, which Republicans held open for several hours as party leadership maneuvered to secure enough votes for passage. One bargaining chip to attract market-oriented Republican votes was the so-called “noninterference clause”—a provision drug manufacturers had a major role in writing and getting through Congress—which banned negotiations between Medicare and pharmaceutical companies on drug prices and prevented the government from developing its own formulary or pricing structure. Instead of CMS negotiating on Part D plans’ behalf, prescription drug plans compete for enrollees and negotiate directly with manufacturers. Part D was progress, but by most accounts it was not enough. Conspicuously absent from President Obama’s signature health reform efforts were any provisions directed at reducing the prices Medicare pays for drugs. The only salient feature of the ACA as it pertains to Part D was the statute’s closing of the “donut hole,” the out-of-pocket amount seniors pay for drugs when their spending exceeds the coverage level but falls short of the catastrophic level at which benefits resume. Closing the donut hole provides more seamless coverage, thereby preventing seniors from having to choose between medication and other needs, but it does not address pricing. Closing the donut hole may actually exacerbate the problem since some patients switched from expensive specialty drugs to generics or stopped taking drugs that may be overused upon reaching the coverage gap. Congress has taken no action to repeal the ban, and that seems unlikely to change. The pharmaceutical industry’s lobbying efforts topped $231 million last year; indeed, the industry has spent more on lobbying than any other industry since 1998. It seems unlikely that a newly elected President would start his or her administration by reigniting the fight with the pharmaceutical industry that previous presidents, of both parties, have lost. The existence of other, lesser-known laws on the books further complicates the issue. Any future president will have to deal with these laws for Medicare’s drug price control efforts to be successful. The most significant of these lesser-known legal provisions originated as CMS guidance implementing the MMA and was subsequently made law in the ACA. This provision requires Part D drug plans to give access to all or nearly all drugs on the market in six protected classes—ranging from anti-retroviral drugs to antidepressants—until CMS promulgates a regulation to change the designated classes. Although originally intended to discourage drug plans from discriminating against patients with certain conditions, such as patients with HIV, this restriction has limited drug plans’ negotiating power by reducing their ability not to cover drugs that are priced above their value. These two legal provisions—the ban to help the pharmaceutical industry and the protected classes to help patients—restrict what CMS can do to control drug prices. Recent attempts to make modest changes reflect the fierceness of the politics around this issue. In 2014, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) tried to make progress with the protected-classes provision by proposing to create a process to remove some drugs from the protected list. That effort, a much less radical change than repealing the negotiations ban, floundered due to industry and consumer backlash. The Contested Merits of Repealing the Ban on Price Negotiation Rarely have we seen a health policy issue on which there is so much apparent consensus that is backed by so little research. Although it seems intuitive that allowing Medicare to negotiate will produce savings, under both Presidents Obama and George W. Bush, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicted repealing the ban would result in only minimal savings. One important reason is that Part D actually already has a negotiating mechanism: Medicare piggybacks on private plans’ incentives to reduce prices. Prescription drug plans participating in Part D bid to contract with Medicare and compete for enrollees. In order to offer competitive prices, the plans negotiate directly with drug companies — even though Medicare itself cannot. The plans are frequently successful when there are competing drugs because the plans can use exclusion of drugs from the formulary or placement of drugs on preferred or non-preferred tiers as leverage to obtain higher rebates and lower net prices. Medicare benefits from those lower drug prices. Thus, it is not clear how much repealing the ban would change things, although it is possible that Medicare could use its scale to negotiate a volume discount for unique drugs that face a less competitive market. To address the high prices of unique drugs, Richard Frank and Joseph Newhouse have suggested the strategy of negotiations followed by binding arbitration if the government and manufacturers cannot agree to a price after a fixed time period. A different concern, often raised by pharmaceutical companies, is that proposals to give Medicare Part D negotiating power could stifle innovation. Some studies suggest the pharmaceutical and biotech industry increased investments in research and development of drugs for seniors after the passage of Medicare Part D. Since drug development is expensive and an uncertain business, reductions in the potential pay-off of drugs aimed at the senior population could affect companies’ willingness to invest in those drugs. A complete repeal of the non-interference clause may not be in the immediate future, but there are other ways to implement effective negotiation. One idea in this vein that has shown promise is value-based pricing, sometimes called “pay for performance.” Under this model—which leading industry executives such as former PhRMA President and Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier support—payers and pharmaceutical companies negotiate to link prices for medicines to the actual value achieved. This approach could mitigate concerns about innovation since under this model breakthrough innovations that improve health would receive higher reimbursement than less effective medications. Practical Politics: Incremental Steps and Pilots in Value-Based Pricing Some of the most important major policy changes in health care began with pilot programs or experiments in the states. The ACA was inspired by Massachusetts’ health reform law, passed in 2006. The ACA embraces this philosophy of incremental, tested reform. The ACA has created an extraordinary number of pilot programs, and launched the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI), whose mission is to test new models. A major benefit to initiating reform through pilot programs is that it can be done administratively — through CMS, acting without Congress and federal legislation. In other words, the evidence base can be constructed without worrying about the politics of congressional gridlock. It seems likely that embracing the ACA’s philosophy of testing new policies on a smaller scale will result in the most progress on the question of Part D’s negotiating power. A pilot of a partial repeal of the ban, perhaps with a value-based component, could provide the evidence base to make broader political moves possible. The ACA gives HHS powers to waive Medicare requirements for the purpose of testing models that address potentially avoidable expenditures. These tests, conducted by CMMI, include a proposed value-based project for the drug benefit in Medicare Part B, which covers drugs administered by doctors and hospitals. The Part B pilot, which has been hotly contested by stakeholders, institutes innovative payment models, such as risk-sharing agreements that link payments to patient outcomes, building on the mandate of the ACA to move from blind pricing to value-based pricing. We would encourage a similar pilot for Part D that would allow the government to negotiate value-based arrangements and use a limited waiver of the ban on government formulary power as leverage in these negotiations. Other models—such as allowing Medicare to negotiate the purchase of unique drugs that lack competitors—ideally also would be tested as parallel pilots. President Obama’s recent budgets call for CMS to negotiate on prices for high-cost drugs and biologics. Of course, a pilot would have its own set of challenges. For instance, the demonstration project would need to choose specific classes of drugs to focus on and determine how value-based contracts would interact with existing prescription drug plan arrangements. One pivotal decision is whether CMS would lead central negotiations with drug manufacturers and mandate the resulting value-based arrangements for participating drug plans, or if drug plans would negotiate directly. Central negotiations have the advantage of allowing the government to track the value achieved over time, since enrollees may switch between plans during the course of the pilot, making measurement more difficult. Specific value-based arrangements might include: reference pricing, payment for results, and bundling. Reference pricing sets a benchmark price for therapeutically similar drugs and would require determining which drugs are interchangeable. Under a payment for results model, CMS would enter risk-sharing agreements with drug manufacturers to link patient outcomes to payments. Specific outcome targets would have to be identified and negotiated with drug manufacturers, and outcome data would have to be tracked and collected for each patient. Bundling pays for clinically associated products and services at a set price. Implementing this model for a specific group of patients would require integration with other parts of Medicare. Under any model, CMS would need to rigorously analyze the data and communicate its results. These challenges are not insurmountable, and policy analysis should now focus on resolving these questions. The payoff is potentially large: a demonstration project for Part D negotiation with a value-based pricing model is an achievable first step to building the evidence that will guide future action. Drugs and Medical Innovation Associated Topics: Medicare Tags: Medicare Part D, Pharma, Politics Comments 2 Trackbacks for “The Politics of Medicare and Drug-Price Negotiation (Updated)” The Politics of Medicare and Drug-Price Negotiation | COPA September 28th, 2016 at 10:10 am Health Policy Updates: | Wonkologist.com September 24th, 2016 at 1:02 pm 3 Responses to “The Politics of Medicare and Drug-Price Negotiation (Updated)” Arvind Cavale says: The above-mentioned concepts may only work in cases of drugs the effects of which are entirely under the influence of the prescriber/administerer. There are many drugs that treat chronic conditions, the outcomes of which are almost entirely dependent on the patient/user of these drugs. Value-based pricing for such drugs will most likely be erroneous at best and completely unreliable at worst. As is obvious, a large portion of Medicare drug costs can be attributed to the treatment of chronic conditions like diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, congestive heart failure, COPD. None of the above-mentioned tactics would be effective for drugs treating these illnesses. Unfortunately, the authors continue the often-failed quest to identify a centrally-controlled solution to the drug cost problem. The most effective action would be to outsource Medicare drug program to private insurers, who can negotiate costs themselves. Medicare needs to seriously move towards becoming a premium-support program. The government (with it’s political pulls) is poorly equipped to operate the country’s largest insurance company. October 20th, 2016 at 8:46 pm Roben Mata says: The recent exponential increases in rare pharmaceutical drugs has caused controversy over the past several weeks. From Martin Shkreli 5000% increase to EpiPens’ increase, It appears that the drug companies are trying to take advantage of ill patients without alternative options. It raises questions on regulations on the Drug industry. These price hikes are unheard of in other U.S. industries. I believe the media is not emphasizing the severity of this issue. If other companies continue to follow unjustified price hikes, this could lead to good health becoming unobtainable for lower class and even middle class families. If there’s strict monitoring over the stock market, there should be monitoring over the industry that protects the health of the people. The FDIC has strict monitoring such as the Bank Merger Act that prevents banks from creating monopolies. There needs to be an organization that oversees price changes with pharmaceutical companies similar to the FDIC and the stock exchange. People’s lives should not be prioritized over greed. By Order of the Board of Directors, July 7, 1998. “Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.” FDIC Law, Regulations, Related Acts. N.p., n.d. Web. 19 Sept. 2016. September 21st, 2016 at 1:25 pm Spike says: If Big Pharma has such a huge stake in opposing the repeal of the ban on negotiation, they surely must have a trove of data that show the effect on their profits. Otherwise, why fight so vehemently? Most modern countries allow price negotiation, have lower drug prices, and still have pharmaceutical companies that make money. As for innovation, repackaging old drugs and racheting up their price is hardly innovating, more like taking candy from babies, but in this case the innocents die.

The industry announcement coincides with a high-level meeting on antimicrobial resistance as part of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Companies that have signed up to the scheme include leaders in both branded and generic drug production, including Pfizer, Merck, Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline and Allergan, as well as Indian drugmakers Cipla and Wockhardt. The group will work with independent experts to set new factory standards and review supply chains to ensure antibiotic waste does not enter waterways, where it can lead to the breeding of superbugs. Efforts to prevent overuse of antibiotics will involve a review of promotional activities and the implementation, by 2020, of concrete measures such as the removal of incentives to sell the drugs in larger volumes. Though the problem of drug-resistant bacteria has been a feature of medicine since the discovery of penicillin in 1928, it has grown in recent years with the emergence of infections resistant to multiple drugs, such as MRSA.
