Meet the Contributors → Merck Immunotherapy Drug Notches Another FDA Win in Lung Cancer Frank Vinluan May 11th, 2017 @frankvinluan @xconomy Like Us Xconomy New York —  The FDA has approved use of a Merck drug in combination with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for the most common type of lung cancer. The FDA approval for (NYSE: MRK) pembrozlizumab (Keytruda) to treat metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer widens the use of the immunotherapy. Last year, the FDA approved it for lung cancer patients whose tumors produce a high amount of the protein PD-L1, which covered only a fraction of the total cases of lung cancer. The Merck drug, a so-called checkpoint inhibitor, blocks the signals that some cancers use to evade attack by the immune system. Wednesday’s FDA decision approves a combined use of pembrolizumab and the chemotherapy pemetrexed (Almita) to treat lung cancer patients whether or not their tumors express PD-L1. There are more than 200,000 new cases of lung cancer each year in the U.S., and it is the leading cause of cancer death, according to the American Cancer Society. In a research note, Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat wrote that the FDA approval expands the market opportunity for Merck. But that market won’t open up right away. Depending on the age of the patient, some physicians may approach combination therapy differently, Raffat wrote. He added that early adoption of a combination treatment would probably occur with physicians who already treat their patients with pemetrexed. “It’s not a pent-up demand,” Raffat wrote. The FDA granted accelerated approval of the combination after a study in 123 patients showed it had an effect on 55 percent of them, nearly double the effect in the pemetrexed-only group. Among patients treated with the combination, 93 percent showed a response to the drug for six months or more, compared to 81 percent of patients treated with only chemotherapy. The study also was based on the patients’ progression-free survival, which is a measure of time after treatment that a patient lives without the cancer worsening. Median progression-free survival was 13 months in the combination treatment group, compared to 8.9 months in the chemotherapy group. Pembrolizumab is also approved for certain kinds of skin cancer, head-and-neck cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma. While the market for checkpoint inhibitors has grown, some companies have stumbled with their drugs. Though Genentech, the South San Francisco-based unit of Swiss pharma giant Roche, received accelerated FDA approval for its atezolizumab (Tecentriq) last year to treat the most common type of bladder cancer, the company announced Wednesday that it failed a Phase 3 study in more advanced forms of the disease. Meanwhile, Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) saw its checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab (Opdivo) win FDA approvals in skin, lung, and kidney cancers, as well as one form of Hodgikin lymphoma. But last year, while pembrolizumab was moving ahead in previously untreated lung cancer, nivolumab failed an important late-stage study in those patients. Image by the National Cancer Institute.

The lab, among the nine global labs for Merck, will collaborate with local generic pharma firms who look at transitioning to making biopharmaceuticals for both the local and global markets. "We can bring the service to the Indian manufacturers so that they can avoid the pitfalls while they were exporting drugs to other countries. We have customers who are domestic manufacturers who have been exporting formulations in the generic space and want to make the transition to biopharmaceuticals," said Peter Salazar, Head, Process Solutions for Merck in India said. The firm is engaged with around 20 biopharma firms, who can explore and collaborate with Merck scientists to develop proteins from cells, purify them, test and manufacture in lab scale. The lab will also help pharma firms in the process for technology absorption, production of drugs for clinical trials and documentation for regulatory approvals "There is no upfront fee for the service. We help them adopt the technology. Our revenue generation will depend on equipment and consumables," said Salazar. "We can offer end to end solution starting from clone development to manufacturing space, that is the reason for the M Lab." The lab includes a simulated manufacturing environment and enables collaboration with Merck experts to evaluate processes and accelerates development and production of new therapies. This helps in reducing time to manufacture by as much as 80 per cent and cost by 30 per cent. In addition, education on best practices and new approaches to develop, optimize and scale-up processes and ways to simplify global technology transfer will be available to customers. "Bangalore is a hub for India's rapidly growing biopharmaceutical manufacturing industry," said Udit Batra, Member of the Merck Executive Board and CEO, Life Science in a statement.

Politics HomeAlternative HealthMaker of Shingles Vaccine Faces Lawsuits Maker of Shingles Vaccine Faces Lawsuits May 12, 2017 Staff Alternative Health 0 A legal action against pharmaceutical giant Merck is shedding more light on vaccination dangers. Among the side effects listed in the warnings on packaging of Zostavax, a vaccination advertised to prevent shingles, are necrotizing retinitis, a severe eye disorder, and shingles.  By James Spounias A group of lawsuits that allege pharmaceutical giant Merck’s Zostavax—a vaccine that is purported to prevent herpes zoster (shingles)—caused damage is shedding light on the possible dangers of this highly advertised medical treatment. In 2015, sales of Zostavax topped $749 million. Trial lawyer Marc Bern reports he is gathering “thousands of complaints” yet to be filed in Philadelphia. Bern told pharmaceutical news website “FiercePharma,” “I think Merck has failed terribly . . . to warn about the very serious side effects and the failure of the vaccine to do what they claim it does.” Bern filed what is believed to be the first lawsuit against Merck. Plaintiff Jorja Bentley, from Nevada, claims that Merck failed to warn of the risk of viral infection and that she suffered a headache, dizziness, and blurred vision shortly after receiving the vaccine. She stated that she continues to suffer from injury to her right eye, elevated blood pressure, headaches, and dizziness. Bug Out While You Still Can! Learn More… Bern stated: “We’ve been looking at this potential case for some time, and we believe it is highly meritorious. We believe the vaccine is at best 50% effective. Either it is not effective, or it has caused shingles and other issues, like in this case, where it has caused a serious [eye] complication.” The fact that Zostavax may be implicated in eye-damage claims became better known when Merck got permission from the FDA in 2016 to include a warning that reads, “Eye Disorders: necrotizing retinitis (patients on immunosuppressive therapy).” Tellingly, another side effect of the shingles vaccine is shingles. According to an Aug. 28, 2014 approval letter, the FDA granted Merck’s request “to include ‘infections and infestations: Herpes zoster (vaccine strain)’ and to update the patient package insert to include ‘shingles’ in the ‘What are the possible side effects of Zostavax?’ section.” In 2011, “gastro-intestinal disorders: nausea” was added as well. Most claims against vaccine makers never make it to court because the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) of 1986 created a compensation program for vaccine injuries, the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), run through the Department of Health and Human Services. Many, but not all, vaccines are registered with the VICP, and because Zostavax is not registered, individuals are allowed to pursue litigation against Merck. The VICP reviews vaccine injury claims, which are not limited to childhood vaccines. Roughly $3 billion has been awarded to victims since its creation in the 1980s, even though nearly two out of three claims are denied compensation. Vaccine skeptics have plenty to say about the shingles vaccine. Anne Dachel, media editor for “AgeOfAutism.com,” which is a website devoted to assisting those who believe that autism is an environmentally induced illness, interviewed Dr. Kenneth Stoller, an integrative physician who practices in San Francisco. Dr. Stoller is the author of Incurable Me, a book that exposes some of the darkest secrets of the medical industry. Stoller told Ms. Dachel that there is “zero credible safety data” on vaccines. “Vaccines are not tested for safety against a saline placebo,” he said. “They are tested against a solution that contains all of the adjuvants, metals, DNA, and other toxins etc., but just minus the infectious disease itself—in this case the varicella virus. So the safety data and adverse event data Merck cites in their package does not have a lot of meaning.” How our immune systems respond to viruses cannot be reduced to the simplistic idea that a vaccine will protect us against a virus, and that those who are unvaccinated pose a risk to those who may be immune compromised. Introducing live or dead viruses into our system, by injection or orally, with or without “dangerous adjuvants,” is not the answer to fighting disease, according to some medical professionals. Ms. Dachel posted a statement by Robert Krakow, former prosecutor and co-author of “Unanswered Questions from the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program: A Review of Compensated Cases of Vaccine-Induced Brain Injury,” a 2011 article published in Pace Environmental Law Review. Krakow, now in private practice, handles vaccine injury claims and gave this statement to Ms. Dachel: “Given the obvious risk of serious injury from the Zostavax vaccine, any person over 50 should proceed with caution regarding the commercially promoted recommendation to get this vaccine. While shingles can be serious in rare cases, my view is that efforts to maintain good health and a strong immune system will serve us better in preventing shingles than obtaining this vaccine, which has the undeniable risk of serious injury. Place your ad here Loading… There are almost 5,000 reports of adverse events after Zostavax. The vaccine contains substances that can provoke autoimmunity. . . . As with many other vaccines, I am not convinced that the vaccine or its components have been properly tested. The promotion of Zostavax on television and other places is as irresponsible as it is inappropriate. The value of the vaccine is overstated, while the risk of adverse reactions is downplayed.” Whether someone should get the shingles vaccine is a matter of personal choice. This writer and American Free Press do not give medical advice. We do believe it is our obligation, though, to provide information for readers to research further and consult with their medical professionals.

More people die each year from lung cancer than from breast, prostate and colorectal cancers combined The race among Big Pharma to develop a successful lung cancer treatment is hotting up, with AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN), Merck & Co Inc (NYSE:MRK) and Bristol Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY). Earlier this week, American group Merck got a massive boost when the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its flagship Keytruda immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy. Merck got initial approval back in October but various restrictions meant it could only target a subset of patients. Analysts reckon this new approval opens up its Keytruda-chemo combo to more than 90% of newly diagnosed non-small-cell lung-cancer patients. Merck’s success has come at the expense of both AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers and it’s certainly in pole position at the moment, but the race to be the long-term undisputed leader in the market is far from over. Things can change quickly at the top, just ask Bristol. The group was comfortably ahead of the chasing pack this time last year but its flagship Opdivo drug failed a trial in newly-diagnosed lung cancer patients last summer. Astra and Bristol bet that two is better than one This is where it gets interesting, with both Astra and Bristol going down a different route to Merck to develop what they hope will be a better, and therefore more lucrative, treatment. The drugs giants are betting that a combination of two immuno-oncology drugs can work together to boost the effectiveness of the overall treatment. Astra is currently running its highly-anticipated MYSTIC phase III trial which is looking at how two of its lead IO drugs, Imfinzi and tremelimumab, work together in lung cancer patients. Bristol too is exploring if Opdivo is more effective when partnered up with another of its drugs. There’s some support in the pharma industry that putting two drugs together to create one ‘super treatment’ will work, although not all analysts are convinced. We’ll only find out for sure once the two report data from the trials, which is expected to be any time over the next month or two for Astra and later in the year or early 2018 for Bristol. Recent data bodes well for Astra’s MYSTIC trial AstraZeneca reported “positive results” from its phase III PACIFIC lung cancer trial on Friday. The study showed that Imfinzi reduced the risk of a patient’s lung cancer worsening or causing death. We won’t know about overall survival until that data is analysed in more detail, but it bodes well for Astra given that Imfinzi is one half of the key MYSTIC trial. MYSTIC is seen as high-risk by the markets, but with Imfinzi coming up trumps on Friday, it would seem AstraZeneca’s chances of getting it across the line have improved slightly. “In terms of impact, we think this will significantly increase confidence in AZ's overall I-O franchise given this is a positive phase III readout,” said Liberum analyst Roger Franklin. “The fact the success was 'clinically meaningful' and in all-comers suggests meaningful commercial potential.” Is Roche a contender as well? Aside from Astra and Bristol, Roche is another player in the market which could challenge Merck at the top. It is testing its lead IO drug Tecentriq alongside chemotherapy and its well-stablished blockbuster, Avastin. The data from the trial is expected at some point in the next quarter of this year, and should it be positive, then a direct rival for Keytruda might not be too far away. The signs don’t look too promising at the moment though, given that Tecentriq failed in a bladder cancer study earlier this month. Lung cancer treatment is a huge potential market Given the significant competition in the lung cancer treatment space, you’d be forgiven for asking why at least one of them hasn’t considered shifting its focus elsewhere. The cold truth is that the treatment of lung cancer is an extremely lucrative business, potentially worth tens of billions of dollars to these companies in the not too distant future. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men in women, and it is expected that around 155,000 people will die from the disease this year in the US alone. Around the globe it accounts for roughly one-third of all cancer deaths – that’s more than breast, prostate and colorectal cancers combined. Given how big the problem is then, it’s easy to see that an improved solution could be very profitable. Only recently analysts tipped Merck’s Keytruda to generate the best part of US$7bn in sales by 2020. Even Astra’s currently less-developed tremelimumab drug is tipped to hit the US$500mln annual sales mark over the same period while Bristol’s Yervoy could surpass US$1.5bn. With today’s update, there’s a chance that those figures for treme might get a bump, as well.

He previously wrote about management and corporate strategy for Quartz and Business Insider. Follow @MaxNisen Facebook Twitter Email Print Share May 11, 2017 3:13 PM EDT BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB CO -0.11 At Closing, May 12th 55.03 USD Merck & Co.'s 2017 just got a whole lot brighter. The company announced Wednesday evening that its immune-boosting cancer drug Keytruda can now be prescribed in combination with chemotherapy, vaulting it ahead of its rivals in the space. It's huge news. But exactly how huge it is going forward is largely out of Merck's control.  Reversal Merck's lung cancer success has come at Bristol-Myers Squibb's expense In October, Keytruda became the first drug in this class -- there are five total on the U.S. market now -- to be approved for newly diagnosed lung-cancer patients. Lung cancer is the largest market available thus far to these medicines, known as immune-oncology (IO) drugs. But Merck's initial approval was limited to a subset of patients whose tumors had a high level of a biomarker that predict's Keytruda's success; the chemo combo widens its approval to more than 90 percent of newly diagnosed non-small-cell lung-cancer patients, according to a research note from Morgan Stanley analyst David Risinger. The initial approval was in about 20 percent of patients. That, along with better patient results for the chemo combo, should help boost the drug's lung-cancer sales rapidly.  The question is how long and how much Merck will enjoy this lead. Number of Approved IO Drugs on the U.S. Market 5 The most immediate threat is from a different combination approach; AstraZeneca PLC and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. are trying to treat lung cancer with combos of two different IO drugs instead of just one with an older chemotherapy. There's a strong scientific rationale for believing these drugs will be more effective in combination, according to a recent Bloomberg Intelligence report. But this approach also comes with substantial safety issues relative to Merck's combination. That will put a lot of pressure on data from pivotal trials for both firms, expected mid-year for AstraZeneca and later this year or in early 2018 for Bristol-Myers. Right now, analysts don't expect too much of these rival combinations. Tremelimumab, which AstraZeneca is combining with its lead IO drug Imfinzi, is expected to generate $500 million in annual sales by 2020. Bristol's Yervoy, already approved in combination with its flagship Opdivo in skin cancer, is also expected to add about $500 million in annual sales over the same period. That's not chump change, but it pales in comparison to the nearly $7 billion expected from Keytruda that year.  Better Together? AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers Squibb are trying to combine their lead IO drugs (Opdivo and Imfinzi) with a second one in order to boost effectiveness, but analysts are skeptical about the potential of the approach Source: Bloomberg The other potential hurdle is Roche Holding AG, which is testing its lead IO drug Tecentriq in lung cancer alongside chemotherapy and its established cancer blockbuster Avastin. If that trial data matches or exceeds Merck's when released in the third quarter -- which is not certain, considering that Tecentriq flopped in a bladder-cancer study on Wednesday -- then direct competition for Keytruda may arrive in relatively short order. This creates a wide range of possible outcomes. While Merck will likely dominate the lung-cancer market for the rest of 2017, it may face as many as three competitors with potentially more compelling trial results as soon as the first half of 2018. On the other hand, it's also possible Merck could have the market to itself for a much longer stretch than that. Or its combo may prove to be safer or more effective than its rivals. Merck is now firmly leading the lung-cancer market, and arguably the IO market in general. But it knows how quickly fortunes can change. Bristol-Myers was seen as leading the pack comfortably until Opdivo failed an aggressive trial in newly diagnosed lung-cancer patients, where Keytruda is succeeding. Merck can't get too comfortable in its perch. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.

Over the decades, Ebola cases have been confirmed in 10 African countries, including Congo where the disease was first reported in 1976. But until this year, Ebola had never come to West Africa. (AP Photo/ Michael Duff) [Photo Source: VOA News] RELATED NEWS Congo ruling party signs deal to end President Kabila’s rule D.R. Congo: 40 killed, 460 arrested in protests against Kabila At least 22 killed in anti-government protests in Congo UN records 411 human rights violations in DR Congo Two TV stations ordered off the air in DR Congo ​Nigeria's Falconets beat Congo; through to World Cup qualifiers final round Oliseh suffers first defeat as Congo beat Nigeria’s Super Eagles The GAVI global vaccine alliance said on Friday some 300,000 emergency doses of an Ebola vaccine developed by Merck could be available in case of a large-scale outbreak of the disease, after the World Health Organisation (WHO) confirmed a fatal case in Congo. The vaccine, known as “rVSV-ZEBOV”, was shown to be highly protective against Ebola in clinical trials published in December 2016. A spokesperson for the WHO told Reuters on Friday that a person in the Democratic Republic of Congo had died after becoming infected with Ebola, a contagious virus that causes hemorrhagic fever. The experimental vaccine was highly protective against the deadly virus in a major trial in Guinea, according to results published in The Lancet. The vaccine is the first to prevent infection from one of the most lethal known pathogens, and the findings add weight to early trial results published in 2016 The vaccine was studied in a trial involving 11 841 people in Guinea during 2015. Among the 5,837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination. In comparison, there were 23 cases 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine. The trial was led by WHO, together with Guinea’s Ministry of Health, Medecins sans Frontieres and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, in collaboration with other international partners. “While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa’s Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless,” said Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO’s Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation, and the study’s lead author. The vaccine’s manufacturer, Merck, Sharpe & Dohme, this year received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration and PRIME status from the European Medicines Agency, enabling faster regulatory review of the vaccine once it is submitted. Since Ebola virus was first identified in 1976, sporadic outbreaks have been reported in Africa. The 2013–2016 West African Ebola outbreak, which resulted in more than 11 300 deaths, highlighted the need for a vaccine. The trial took place in the coastal region of Basse-Guinée, the area of Guinea still experiencing new Ebola cases when the trial started in 2015. The trial used an innovative design, a so-called “ring vaccination” approach, the same method used to eradicate small pox. When a new Ebola case was diagnosed, the research team traced all people who may have been in contact with that case within the previous three weeks, such as people who lived in the same household, were visited by the patient, or were in close contact with the patient, their clothes or linen, as well as certain “contacts of contacts”. A total of 117 clusters (or “rings”) were identified, each made up of an average of 80 people.

Over the decades, Ebola cases have been confirmed in 10 African countries, including Congo where the disease was first reported in 1976. But until this year, Ebola had never come to West Africa.

The vaccine, known as “rVSV-ZEBOV”, was shown to be highly protective against Ebola in clinical trials published in December 2016. A spokesperson for the WHO told Reuters on Friday that a person in the Democratic Republic of Congo had died after becoming infected with Ebola, a contagious virus that causes hemorrhagic fever. The experimental vaccine was highly protective against the deadly virus in a major trial in Guinea, according to results published in The Lancet. The vaccine is the first to prevent infection from one of the most lethal known pathogens, and the findings add weight to early trial results published in 2016 The vaccine was studied in a trial involving 11 841 people in Guinea during 2015. Among the 5,837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination. In comparison, there were 23 cases 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine. The trial was led by WHO, together with Guinea’s Ministry of Health, Medecins sans Frontieres and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, in collaboration with other international partners. “While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa’s Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless,” said Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO’s Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation, and the study’s lead author. The vaccine’s manufacturer, Merck, Sharpe & Dohme, this year received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration and PRIME status from the European Medicines Agency, enabling faster regulatory review of the vaccine once it is submitted. Since Ebola virus was first identified in 1976, sporadic outbreaks have been reported in Africa. The 2013–2016 West African Ebola outbreak, which resulted in more than 11 300 deaths, highlighted the need for a vaccine. The trial took place in the coastal region of Basse-Guinée, the area of Guinea still experiencing new Ebola cases when the trial started in 2015. The trial used an innovative design, a so-called “ring vaccination” approach, the same method used to eradicate small pox. When a new Ebola case was diagnosed, the research team traced all people who may have been in contact with that case within the previous three weeks, such as people who lived in the same household, were visited by the patient, or were in close contact with the patient, their clothes or linen, as well as certain “contacts of contacts”. A total of 117 clusters (or “rings”) were identified, each made up of an average of 80 people.

The trial results are an unexpectedly early boost for the product, known commercially as Imfinzi, which the company hopes will become a blockbuster drug with sales in the billions of dollars. It sets AstraZeneca apart from rivals Merck and Roche, whose equivalent drugs are years behind in the race for similar treatments against lung cancer. Shares in AstraZeneca extended gains to be up by 9.1 percent by mid-afternoon, the top FTSE 100 riser, hitting its highest level since September 2016 and set for its biggest one day rise since May 2014. Merck fell 1.5 percent, while Roche was up 0.9 percent. AstraZeneca said it was in talks with the authorities over plans for regulatory approval. "These are highly encouraging results for patients with locally-advanced lung cancer for whom surgery is not an option," Sean Bohen, Executive Vice President, Global Medicines Development at AstraZeneca, said in a statement. Analysts said the results of the trial, known as PACIFIC, showed AstraZeneca was ahead of competitors as there was a gap in the market for such treatment. It also augured well for another trial due in mid-2017 which could mean the drug could be used in combination in newly diagnosed cases. "The surprise early positive readout of the PACIFIC trial of... durvalumab (Imfinzi) in locally advanced lung cancer is a major inflection point for AstraZeneca's immuno-oncology," analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a note. "In theory, this could open a market opportunity of $1.75 billion to $3.5 billion (or more) for the drug, which is not included in our current forecasts." RESHAPING THE BUSINESS AstraZeneca is looking to sales of recently launched and experimental cancer medicines to help offset the impact of a loss of patents on blockbusters such as cholesterol pill Crestor. The drug works by helping the body's immune cells kill cancer, offering an alternative to chemotherapy. In this trial it was used after chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Analysts at Berenberg said that trial results, which were earlier than expected, put AstraZeneca ahead of rivals Roche and Merck. The results of their trials for similar treatments aren't expected until September 2019. They also said the efficacy of durvalumab in PACIFIC was a good sign ahead of the results of a trial of the drug in a combination therapy, called MYSTIC. That is used on more advanced cancers, but before or instead of chemotherapy, and results are expected in June or July. "While MYSTIC is still very important, PACIFIC clearly lessens its importance, and provides more reassurance that Imfinzi is an active drug and therefore must have a chance of working in MYSTIC," analysts at Berenberg said. U.S. regulators earlier this month approved durvalumab as a treatment for bladder cancer, marking the first commercial green light for the product.

Between 2012 and 2016, Big Pharma - a peer set of approximately 16 firms across the world with large R&D and sales organizations, and annual revenues in excess of $10bn - signed over 1,200 drug-focused deals, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 12%. The top five dealmakers in terms of volume were AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Roche, Pfizer, and Merck & Co. Overall, Big Pharma represented the majority of the monetary value of all biopharma partnerships: the peer group was responsible for $151bn in deal-making during the five-year period out of the $287bn in all comparable biopharma alliances (including the Big Pharma peer set). As of 2016, Big Pharma companies had approximately 337 candidates in the pipeline for cancer, which is well over two times that of any other therapeutic area. This was reflected in the peer set's deal-making; between 2012 and 2016, about one-third of Big Pharma's in- and out-licensing deals were in oncology, and immuno-oncology was the key driver of oncology in-licensing. Big Pharma companies signed more alliances to bring early-stage candidates in-house than any other phase, and out-licensed more approved or marketed products. One-third of the total in-licensing deal volume involved regional partnering, while out-licensing was led by North American territories - namely the US - where development, commercialization, and research/discovery deal structures were more prominent than flat-out divestments. Both in- and out-licensing by Big Pharma reflected a collaborative nature, as development/co-development and research/discovery were the most commonly used deal structures in alliances.

The approval is significant because it means that immuno-oncology high-flier Keytruda (pembrolizumab) can be prescribed for all first-line NSCLC patients - regardless of how much their tumours express the biomarker PD-L1 - and this is expected to dramatically increase usage of the drug. The accelerated approval is for the combination of Keytruda with pemetrexed/carboplatin and is the first for any anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy in this indication. It will lend additional momentum to Keytruda, which saw sales more than double to $584m in the first quarter of this year. The new indication will allow Merck to pull even further away from its rivals in the market for checkpoint inhibitors in NSCLC, which analysts have suggested could be worth upwards of $10bn a year. Merck already had FDA approval for Keytruda as an alternative to chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC, getting a green light last October for use in patients whose tumours express high levels of PD-L1 (i.e. with 50% or more of the cells producing the biomarker). At a stroke it overtook longstanding competitor Bristol-Myers Squibb in first-line NSCLC - as the latter's Opdivo (nivolumab) drug failed to show a benefit in a phase III trial reported last year - and with the new all-comer indication pulls even further ahead. BMS' hopes of fighting back with a combination of Opdivo and CTLA4 inhibitor Yervoy (ipilimumab) in first-line NSCLC took a knock when it decided not to file for accelerated approval. The company has shrugged off the setbacks however Opdivo sales rose 60% to $1.1bn in the first three months of the year. Merck is now thought to have a window of at least 9 to 12 months compared to Opdivo and other rivals including Roche's PD-L1 inhibitor Tecentriq (atezolizumab), which was approved for second-line NSCLC last October but isn't expected to have first-line data until early 2019. Analysts at Leerink said recently however that there is a large number of combination studies of immuno-oncology drugs due to generate results in the coming months that could dramatically alter the ‘landscape’ of first-line NSCLC therapy.  One example is AstraZeneca's combination of Imfinzi (durvalumab) and CTLA4 inhibitor tremelimumab due to generate first results in mid-2017 with survival data expected in 2018. BMS' experience in first-line NSCLC - and Tecentriq's stunning failure in bladder cancer this week- show that fortunes can change rapidly in the immuno-oncology sector.

An eight-month pilot programme, promoting nutritional health awareness in township schools around Gauteng, is set to change children’s attitudes towards food and lifestyle choices. Merck, a Germany-based science and technology company, launched a campaign called GEN100 South Africa at Lourdes Primary School in Diepkloof, Soweto, yesterday. The programme will form part of the pupils’ curriculum for the subject of Life Orientation. The campaign will study the effects of using “fun, interactive material” to raise awareness and educate youth about healthy living. While the Gauteng department of education is not directly involved in the initiative, the company says it plans to work more closely with the department after the pilot period has ended. “With an average life expectancy of less than 60 years and 30% of the population under 15 years of age, the potential of the GEN100 programme in South Africa is something to be excited about,” said Uta Kemmerich-Keil, chief executive officer of Merck consumer health. “We are passionate about supporting generations in living healthily as we dream about a society where everyone lives longer and healthier lives.” GEN100 is aimed at addressing health issues among SA school children against the backdrop of the country’s growing childhood obesity problem. In 2014, worldwide an estimated 41 million children under the age of five years were overweight or obese. No longer considered a problem exclusive to wealthier countries, being overweight and obese is now on the rise in lowand middle-income countries, particularly in urban settings. In Africa, the number of overweight or obese children nearly doubled from 5.4 million in 1990, to 10.6 million in 2014. The last SA Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found nearly 13.5% of children aged six to 14 in informal settlements in cities were overweight or obese.

But there was a ray of hope. Baker’s oncologist at Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center referred her to a clinical trial at UConn Health involving two immunotherapy drugs: the Food & Drug Administration-approved Keytruda (pembrolizumab) from Merck & Co., credited with successfully treating former President Jimmy Carter’s melanoma; and Epacadostat (IDO1 inhibitor), an experimental drug from Incyte Corp. “There was nothing else out there for me,” said Baker, who lives in Plainville. A year later, the retired nurse is living a full life with minimal side effects. Baker’s outcome is even more extraordinary because she is African American and 81 years old. African Americans and other minorities are at a higher risk for certain types of cancer, yet they continue to be underrepresented in clinical trials for drugs approved by the FDA. A wide disparity More Information Lagging numbers African Americans comprised only 7 percent of clinical drug-trial participants in 2016, up slightly from 5 percent in 2015. Source: U.S. Food & Drug Administration FDA data released in February show that African Americans made up just 7 percent of clinical trial participants in 2016, up slightly from 5 percent in 2015, for novel drugs. Experts said that depsite a recent federal push toward diversity, the disparity remains wide. “The fruits of these efforts will be in future years, given that medical product development, on average, can take a decade or longer,” said Dr. Jonca Bull, FDA assistant commissioner for minority health. For patients, change cannot come soon enough. The latest data from the National Cancer Institute show African American women are more likely to die of breast cancer than white women. In addition, aggressive breast tumors are more common in younger black and Hispanic women; and American Indian and Alaska Natives have higher incidence and death rates for kidney cancer than any other racial/ethnic group. The underrepresentation cuts across diseases. According to the American Diabetes Association, African Americans are 1.7 times more likely to have diabetes compared to whites. Yet they comprised only 3 percent of the clinical trial participants for Adlyxin (lixisenatide), an injectable drug from Sanofi Pharmaceutical Co. approved by the FDA last year for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. To bridge the gap, Congress authorized the FDA to evaluate and address the problem. “This includes raising awareness of patients about the value of participating in clinical research, ensuring that researchers include clinical scientists who are trusted by minority patients, and that oversight is proactive in addressing enrollment changes at the earliest stages,” Bull said. As a result, pharmaceutical companies are putting best practices in place to improve participation, and they say they’re seeing results. Drug companies take action Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., based in Ridgefield, created a cross-cultural leadership team to improve access to clinical trials. The company also is expanding its network of investigators in underserved populations; and is partnering with the Hispanic Federation in New York to create awareness about clinical trials in a culturally relevant way. “We are seeing improvements in minority participation in clinical trials. However, they are not universal to all trials,” said Nancy Di Dia, chief diversity and inclusion officer for Boehringer Ingelheim. “But we are committed to improving it across the board.” Pfizer Inc., which has a research facility in Groton, is collaborating with patients to design trials that will work for them, said Pol Vandenbroucke, vice president for medical strategy at Pfizer. For example, the company hired ethnographers to spend time with people with sickle cell disease — an inherited blood disorder that primarily affects African Americans and other minority populations — to “understand their needs and what might fit into their lives, both for trial participation and pain crisis intervention,” Vandenbroucke said. But some Connecticut researchers say they are struggling to meet diversity enrollment goals. “We’ve had difficulty recruiting minority populations,” said Dr. Salvatore Del Prete, director of clinical trials at Stamford Hospital’s Bennett Cancer Center. “Some minorities are still reluctant to sign on to a trial not because of access but often because of their cultural beliefs or values.” These include lingering fears about a well-documented chapter in history when 600 black men in Tuskegee, Ala., were enrolled, without their consent, in a 40-year syphilis experiment by the Public Health Service, beginning in 1932. The men that had the disease were never informed or treated for it, even after penicillin became an effective treatment for syphilis. Building trust The breast cancer support group Sisters’ Journey in New Haven is trying to build trust between women of color and the medical community through conversations at hair salons, diaper depots and churches. “When you’re asked (to enroll in a clinical trial) by your hair dresser, your church member, that’s where the trust comes from,” said Dawn White-Bracey, president of Sisters’ Journey. “One of our members said, ‘You may trust your hairdresser more than you trust your doctor.’ ” The organization in 2015 helped recruit young black women for a five-year clinical trial conducted by Dr. Kristen Zarfos, a breast surgeon at the Hospital of Central Connecticut. Even though a 1993 law requires all medical research funded by the National Institutes of Health to adequately include minorities, a study by the University of California, San Francisco, found that less than 2 percent succeeded in enrolling enough minority participants. Dr. Roy Herbst, chief of medical oncology at Yale Cancer Center and Smilow Cancer Hospital, said, “The national average is woefully low,” adding that at Yale, “minorities make up well over 10 percent of the (cancer) clinical trial participants.” Dr. Mike Lauer, deputy director for extramural research at the NIH, pointed to several successful trials where minorities were well represented. They include a trial by the Sprint Research Group on the effectiveness of standard versus intensive treatment for blood pressure control (31 percent African Americans); and STICH, a study consisting of two trials for the surgical treatment for ischemic heart failure (34 percent minority). Lauer said the inclusion of women and minorities should start with what is understood about the diseases, meaning that not every study should have the same demographic profile. “Inclusion extends beyond recruitment and retention,” he said. “It’s also important to consider how findings are reported for specific groups.” This story was reported under a partnership with the Connecticut Health I-Team ( www.c-hit.org ).

The treatment, durvalumab (sold under the brand name Imfinzi), is part of a lucrative new class of cancer immunotherapy drugs called "checkpoint inhibitors" being chased by drug titans like Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer, and Roche. AstraZeneca was considerably behind all of those other companies in getting its drug FDA-approved; but the new trial results could give it a big advantage. Click here to subscribe to Brainstorm Health Daily, our brand new newsletter about health innovations. "These are highly encouraging results for patients with locally-advanced lung cancer for whom surgery is not an option," said Sean Bohen, an AstraZeneca executive vice president, in a statement. Wall Street echoed the optimism. "In theory, this could open a market opportunity of $1.75 billion to $3.5 billion (or more) for the drug, which is not included in our current forecasts," wrote Deutsche Bank analysts in a research note. The cancer immunotherapy field (comprised of therapies that use the body's immune system to fight the disease) has been a roller coaster over the last few years. Bristol-Myers once seemed like it could dominate the space before big clinical trial setbacks for its treatment, Opdivo; Merck's Keytruda has been on a roll, including a key FDA approval this week for treating advanced lung cancer.

(Roland Magnusson/Shutterstock) ALLISON GATLIN 5/12/2017 Reprints AstraZeneca (AZN) could "have a real seat at the immuno-oncology table," an analyst said Friday after the company's key drug, Imfinzi, cut the risk of death in lung cancer — prodding shares to an eight-month high. In a late-stage trial, Imfinzi reduced the risk of the disease worsening or death in Stage 3 lung cancer patients who had already undergone chemotherapy with radiation. Stage 3 lung cancer is estimated to have affected 100,000 patients across the U.S., Japan, Germany, France, the UK, Spain and Italy in 2016, and represents about one-third of all cases of non-small-cell lung cancer, AstraZeneca said. Full results will be presented at a future medical meeting, the company added. On the stock market today, AstraZeneca soared 9.2% to 34.01, blasting past a 31.98 buy point out of a cup-with-handle that began forming in August. "At $150,000 per year for therapy, the Stage 3 market for this unique indication in the developed world clearly has blockbuster potential," Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez wrote in a note to clients. He has an outperform rating on AstraZeneca stock. This development "should provide AstraZeneca's Imfinzi with a unique and impactful seat at the immuno-oncology table," and could expand the market rather than pit AstraZeneca against "three other established competitors," Fernandez wrote. The announcement came two days after Dow component Merck's (MRK) immuno-oncology star, Keytruda, was granted accelerated approval to treat advanced lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy. But Roche's (RHHBY) Tecentriq failed in a bladder cancer trial. Shares of rival Merck fell 1.3% to 63.57. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) stock dipped 0.2% to 55.03. Roche stock, on the other hand, lifted 1.3% to 33.70. These three are AstraZeneca's closest immuno-oncology rivals. IBD'S TAKE: Need some direction in the biotech and drug world? Head to IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News for the latest. Like Merck's Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo, AstraZeneca's Imfinzi is what's known as a PD-1 antibody. It works by targeting the interaction between an immune system cell and a tumor cell to help the immune system spot the hidden cancer. The company estimates it has a two- to three-year lead on competitors. Ongoing immuno-oncology trials from the likes of Merck, Bristol and Roche are looking at neoadjuvant treatment trials and single-arm safety trials. Neoadjuvant treatments are therapies given after chemotherapy, radiation or hormone therapy to shrink the tumor. Single-arm safety trials examine the safety of a drug in just one group of patients. AstraZeneca is also looking at Imfinzi as a first-line monotherapy and in combination with fellow immuno-oncology drug, tremelimumab, in advanced lung cancer. A first-line treatment is the first line of defense. Typically, that's been chemotherapy or radiation. RELATED: Can Dow's Merck Hang On To Edge In Lung Cancer Treatment?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Therapeutics Market: Rising Use of Calcium Channel Blockers Being Witnessed in Obstructive HCM Treatment The global hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) therapeutics market is dominated by companies exhibiting high sales. However, generic manufacturers are making their presence felt in the market gradually. As per Transparency Market Research (TMR), the top three companies in the market, Sanofi S.A., Pfizer, Inc., and Merck & Co., accounted for a share of over 64.5%, which points toward a highly consolidated vendor landscape. Intense competition exists among the top companies in the market. These enterprises are mainly focusing on expanding and differentiating their product portfolio to enjoy sustainable growth. Obtain Report Details @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/hypertrophic-cardiomyo… Demand for HCM Therapeutics Surges due to Increasing Incidence of Congestive Heart Failure “The prevalence of chronic cardiovascular ailments is fueling demand for effective treatment, which has been translating into lucrative sales opportunities for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy therapeutics,” said a lead TMR analyst. Heart diseases make one of the most common causes of death in both men and women around the world. According to TMR, the rising incidence of congestive heart failure considerably fuels demand for effective medications. This creates attractive opportunities for sales of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy therapeutics. „Besides this, successful interventions conducted across several countries to spread awareness about hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have also aided the expansion of the HCM therapeutics market,” said the TMR analyst. Furthermore, patients are now more aware about the latest medical advances, which augurs well for the market. ECG screening is the most efficient technology for diagnosing HCM. The success demonstrated by this technology has significantly contributed in fuelling demand for HCM therapeutics. Rising Penetration of Advanced Medical Devices to Threaten Market Growth Despite witnessing positive growth opportunities, the rising penetration of medical devices such as pacemakers and defibrillators in the healthcare sector has been inhibiting the HCM therapeutics market’s trajectory. Demand for gene therapy and implantable medical devices is rising as patients gain adequate knowledge about positive results offered by such advanced medical devices. The increasing acceptance of these medical devices could limit the scope of expansion for the HCM therapeutics market. For more information on this report, fill the form @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Nevertheless, drugs created specifically for the treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are yet to find approval. Once approved, this indication will bolster sales opportunities for the market players. Additionally, due to the high prevalence of unmet medical needs across Asia Pacific and the increasing medical expenditure in the region also boosts prospects for the HCM therapeutics market. Regionally, North America holds the largest share in the global HCM therapeutics market. However, as per TMR, the market is also expected to witness strong growth in Asia Pacific and Rest of the World. The Asia Pacific HCM therapeutics market is poised to expand at 2.9% CAGR between 2015 and 2023. By drug class, the market was led by calcium channel blockers in 2014. By drug class, the calcium channel blockers is expected to dominate the market. It held over 37.4% of the HCM therapeutics market in 2014. TMR estimates the overall value of the global hypertrophic cardiomyopathy therapeutics market at US$1.2 bn in 2014. Exhibiting a moderate CAGR of 1.4% from 2015 to 2023, the market is expected to reach US$1.3 bn by the end of 2023. This review is based on information published by TMR, in a report titled “Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Therapeutics (HCM) Market – Global Industry Analysis, Pipeline Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecast, 2015 – 2023.” About Us Transparency Market Research (TMR) is a global market intelligence company providing business information reports and services.

Illinois lawmakers delay bill to expand abortion as veto looms Democratic lawmakers in Illinois on Thursday said they have placed on hold a bill that expands state-funded coverage of abortions for low-income residents and state employees but faces a likely veto from the state's Republican governor. The bill, which received final passage in a 33-22 state Senate vote on Wednesday, also aims to keep abortions legal in Illinois if the U.S. Supreme Court follows President Donald Trump's call to overturn its landmark Roe v. Wade ruling that made abortions legal 44 years ago. U.S. candymakers band together to reduce calories Five major chocolate and candy companies announced a joint commitment on Thursday to reduce calories in many sweets sold on the U.S. market, a rare example of cooperation in a competitive industry and testament to a rising consumer distaste for sugar. The United States is the world's largest consumer of sweeteners and obesity, diabetes and heart disease rank among leading health concerns in the country. Help brains by cooling bodies after cardiac arrest People who are left unconscious after their heart suddenly stops should be cooled in an effort to preserve brain function, according to the American Academy of Neurology. Reducing a comatose person's body temperature down to 32 to 34 degrees Celsius (C) - about 90 to 93 degrees Fahrenheit (F) - for 24 hours after rescuing them from cardiac arrest is highly likely to improve brain outcomes, says the organization's new guideline. WHO wants transparency, market revamp for fairer drug pricing The world needs greater transparency on the pricing of medicines, and an overhaul of some approaches, in order to increase access to life-saving drugs, global health experts said on Thursday. Drugmakers are under growing fire as a wave of new treatments for serious conditions like cancer and hepatitis C come to market at sky-high prices, putting them out of reach of many patients and national health services. U.S. FDA approves Merck immunotherapy/chemo combo for lung cancer Merck &amp; Co said on Wednesday U.S. health regulators approved its Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated advanced lung cancer, solidifying the drugmaker's lead position in the field of medicines that help the immune system fight cancer. Lung cancer is by far the largest oncology market and the approval significantly expands the number of patients available for Keytruda therapy. Prisoners care for abused animals as part of rehab program Kristina Hazelett had cats, birds and hamsters growing up, but she never knew much about dogs until she started serving a several-month jail sentence for drug possession. The 35-year-old inmate is part of a small team of women prisoners in Phoenix, Arizona who work with the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office Animal Safety Unit (MASH). The program is designed to help comfort and train mistreated and neglected animals rescued from deplorable conditions. Chinese artist offers flower, kitten tattoos to mums with birth scars After trying cosmetic creams and surgery, Wang Jing placed her hopes in the skilled hands of a tattoo artist to make the scar on her belly finally disappear. "Whenever you try to reach for something your belly is exposed. It's not nice looking," Wang, 46, said of the scar from the caesarian birth of her daughter two decades ago that would soon be covered by a kitten tattoo. U.S. hepatitis C cases soar on spike in heroin use U.S. health officials said new cases of hepatitis C rose nearly 300 percent from 2010 to 2015, despite the availability of cures for the liver disease, fueled by a spike in the use of heroin and other injection drugs, according to a report released on Thursday. In 2015, the national reported rate of hepatitis C was 0.8 per 100,000 persons with nearly 34,000 new infections, according to the report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. China H7N9 bird flu death toll fell to 24 in April: health authority China reported 24 human fatalities from H7N9 bird flu in April, the national health authority said on Friday, compared with 47 deaths in March.

Smoking only in social situations may still be tied to heart problems So-called social smokers who only light up on special occasions may have some of the same risks for heart disease as people with a daily cigarette habit, a U.S. study suggests. For the study, researchers examined data on smoking habits, cholesterol levels and blood pressure for a nationally representative sample of 39,555 adults. Most people said they didn't smoke, while roughly 17 percent were current smokers and about 10 percent were social smokers who didn't have a daily habit but did regularly smoke in certain situations.

The high pace of expansion is likely to raise some questions among shareholders. By Maike Telgheder Published on 12. May 2017, 05:08 Audio Audio LISTEN Pdf Fresenius CEO Stephan Sturm is going for growth. Source: Reuters. Stephan Sturm, the new chief executive of healthcare company Fresenius, will announce plans to continue the company’s proven strategy — a combination of organic growth plus acquisitions — at his first AGM this Friday. Mr. Sturm took up the top job in mid-2016. Only a few weeks later, he announced the largest takeover in the history of the company: the purchase of the Spanish hospital chain Quironsalud for €5.8 billion ($6.3 billion). He also announced plans to take over US drug maker Akorn for the equivalent of €4.4 billion. And Fresenius is investing up to €670 million in the acquisition of Merck’s biosimilar drugs division. Even if the high pace of expansion raises some questions among shareholders, the acquisitions do not affect the company’s 2016 balance sheet. Bridge financing was agreed to in 2016 for the purchase of Quironsalud, but the purchase was not concluded until January 2017. Fresenius’ 2016 financial statement is characterized once again by growing revenues and profits. The company is increasing its dividend for the 24th time in a row. It’s comforting business as usual for the shareholders of the DAX-listed company, who will be asked to approve a 13-percent dividend increase to 62 cents at the shareholders’ meeting. In addition, the Fresenius share has outperformed the DAX in a volatile environment in 2016. While Germany’s benchmark index rose by 7 percent, Fresenius shares gained 13 percent. The healthcare group benefits from the fact that it operates in fields that are mostly unrelated to the economy. Its Fresenius Medical Care subsidiary, which is also listed on the DAX, accounts for more than half of Fresenius’ sales and operating result. The Kabi and Helios divisions are each responsible for one-fifth of sales. Kabi sells nutritional solutions and liquid generic drugs worldwide, and Helios is the largest operator of private hospitals in Germany. Finally, the small Vamed division plans, develops and manages healthcare facilities. Want to keep reading? Subscribe now or log in to read our coverage of Europe’s leading economy.

H5N1 "Medicine is a social science, and politics is nothing else but medicine on a large scale"—Rudolf Virchow « ECDC epidemiological update: Yellow fever outbreak in Brazil | Main May 12, 2017 Ebola vaccine could get first real-world test in emerging outbreak Thanks to Greg Folkers for sending the link to this report in Nature News & Comment: Ebola vaccine could get first real-world test in emerging outbreak. Excerpt: An outbreak of the Ebola virus has emerged in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the World Health Organization (WHO) said on 12 May. Congolese authorities have reported nine suspected cases of Ebola infection in the past three weeks; the WHO has confirmed one, and tests are pending on others.  Now health officials are considering whether to deploy an experimental Ebola vaccine against the outbreak, for the first time since the WHO gave it preliminary approval in April.   The aid group Medicins san Frontieres (MSF, or Doctors Without Borders) is discussing a potential vaccination campaign with the Congolese government, an MSF spokesperson says. That would require the approval of the WHO, which has not decided whether to call on the approved experimental vaccine or others in development, says WHO spokesman Tarik Jašarević.  Still, he says, “we are taking this [outbreak] seriously because Ebola is always serious”. The last outbreak of the virus, in West Africa from 2014 to 2016, killed 11,325 people; the more than a dozen known outbreaks in the DRC have been less severe.   There are now 12 candidate Ebola vaccines in development. None is yet approved for sale, in part because the vaccine candidates were not ready for testing until the West African Ebola crisis was on the wane. But on 27 April, the WHO’s advisory group on immunization recommended that an experimental vaccine called rVSV-SEBOV be deployed promptly should an Ebola outbreak arise. Developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada and licensed by the drug companies New Link Genetics and Merck, rVSV-SEBOV showed promise in a study published in the Lancet last December. The trial included 11,841 people in Guinea in 2015, near the end of the Ebola outbreak there. None of the 5,837 people who received the vaccine got the disease ten days after vaccination. But there were 23 cases among the thousands of other people included in the trial.  A look ahead  The deployment of rVSV-SEBOV may be warranted in the DRC, because the vaccine is based on the Zaire strain of Ebola that is driving the current outbreak, says Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases. If public-health authorities decide to proceed, there is a supply of rVSV-SEB at the ready: GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, signed an agreement with Merck in 2016 to purchase 300,000 doses of vaccine for use in future outbreaks. May 12, 2017 at 08:46 PM in Ebola, NGOs, Vaccination, Vaccines | Permalink Reblog (0) | | | | Comments Ebola vaccine could get first real-world test in emerging outbreak Thanks to Greg Folkers for sending the link to this report in Nature News & Comment: Ebola vaccine could get first real-world test in emerging outbreak. Excerpt: An outbreak of the Ebola virus has emerged in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the World Health Organization (WHO) said on 12 May. Congolese authorities have reported nine suspected cases of Ebola infection in the past three weeks; the WHO has confirmed one, and tests are pending on others.  Now health officials are considering whether to deploy an experimental Ebola vaccine against the outbreak, for the first time since the WHO gave it preliminary approval in April.   The aid group Medicins san Frontieres (MSF, or Doctors Without Borders) is discussing a potential vaccination campaign with the Congolese government, an MSF spokesperson says. That would require the approval of the WHO, which has not decided whether to call on the approved experimental vaccine or others in development, says WHO spokesman Tarik Jašarević.  Still, he says, “we are taking this [outbreak] seriously because Ebola is always serious”. The last outbreak of the virus, in West Africa from 2014 to 2016, killed 11,325 people; the more than a dozen known outbreaks in the DRC have been less severe.   There are now 12 candidate Ebola vaccines in development.

He died on the way to a bigger hospital. Within days, other people were getting sick, and the pattern was familiar. First it was the chauffeur who drove the initial victim, with the same symptoms. Then the people who’d transported the chauffeur via motorcycle came to a clinic with the classic signs. Now six people are in the hospital, three people have died, and the DRC’s national lab in Kinshasa says at least five of them tested positive for Ebola. Now Médecins Sans Frontières—Doctors Without Borders—is sending 14 people to meet a 10-person team from the DRC’s Health Ministry on Saturday. A cargo plane carrying 16 tons of medical and logistical supplies is en route from Kinshasa to meet them. The disease outbreak fighters are on the way. A catastrophic Ebola epidemic killed more than 11,300 people in West Africa between 2013 and 2016; so far this new outbreak looks small and containable. It’s also a chance for the world’s disease response infrastructure to get its act together; report after report criticized the World Health Organization and the US Department of Health and Human Services for the way they handled that outbreak. They were slow, didn’t follow set procedures, and didn’t deploy enough personnel until too late. It was terrible for West Africa, and it didn’t bode well for future outbreak responses.

Palmer What ‘100 Percent Effective’ Means for That Ebola Vaccine Don’t panic. The DRC has experienced eight small Ebola outbreaks since 1976; the disease is named after a river there. The country has people with experience. “There is precedent. We’ve seen this before, and it’s been possible to contain it,” says Peter Hotez, head of the National School for Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. “On the other hand, we’ve seen the consequences of not being aggressive to put public health control measures in place.” Straight-ahead public health measures like sanitation and protective gear tend to control Ebola despite its florid, grand-guignol symptoms—lots of highly infectious blood and fluids. Only people who come into very close contact with the sick tend to get sick themselves. That puts two particular groups at the highest risk of infection: healthcare workers and people taking care of their own family members or burying the recently deceased. So on the ground, the MSF team will start administering care, potentially building a clinic. They might also work with locals to do triage and surveillance. So far, representatives from the World Health Organization are doing much the same. Bas-Uele is rural and poorly mapped, so MSF is also trying to crowdsource a mapping project, asking locals to add detail and tags to satellite images. Epidemiologist Anne Rimoin’s UCLA-DRC Research Program was already working on mapping parts of the country to help with disease surveillance, so her team has been contributing and helping coordinate in Kinshasa. “Having high quality, detailed maps and geospatial data is crucial for being able to respond and contain outbreaks,” she says. “If you don’t have this information, you might miss lots of villages people just don’t know about.” When you have disease outbreaks in these remote, rural areas that are difficult to get to, they’re also difficult to get out of, and populations don’t move as easily. The problem in West Africa was that this happened in areas that are highly populated with a lot of movement, and that makes outbreaks hard to contain. Anne Rimoin, UCLA-DRC Research Program The 2014 epidemic got as bad as it did in part because West Africa had no real experience with Ebola, and in part because the disease spread from rural areas to cities in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. But Bas-Uele is really far, populated mostly by subsistence farmers and hunters. “When you have disease outbreaks in these remote, rural areas that are difficult to get to, they’re also difficult to get out of, and populations don’t move as easily,” Rimoin says. “The problem in West Africa was that this happened in areas that are highly populated with a lot of movement, and that makes outbreaks hard to contain.” The other issue back then was the lack of a vaccine. That’s no longer the case; a dozen are in trials, and in 2016 a crowd of international researchers published results from Guinea showing that a vaccine called rVSV-Zebov effectively prevented infection of Ebola Zaire, the strain at fault in 2014 and the one at work in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Merck now makes the vaccine, and a 2016 deal between Merck and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, means it has 300,000 doses ready to use. But so far no one has officially licensed the vaccine. That’s not necessarily dispositive. “Preparations are being accelerated to ensure that vaccine and equipment be available on site,” emails Tarik Jašarević, a WHO spokesperson. “Appropriate ethical and regulatory authorization has been sought as the vaccine can only be used under ‘extended access’ US-FDA provisions as it is not yet registered.” If the new outbreak is bigger than it looks, or starts getting bigger, WHO can start “ring vaccinations,” administering the drug to everyone who has had contact with someone infected, and then to their contacts, too. (Hey, it’s worked pretty well in the past.) With luck, they won’t need to use the vaccines. The outbreak will be contained, and the international response efficient and speedy. Because every one of these is an emergency for the people affected, and no matter its scale, it teaches something important for the next one—whether it’s Ebola in Bas-Uele or Zika in Miami.

The case was confirmed from tests on nine people who came down with a haemorrhagic fever in Bas-Uele province in the northeast of the country on or after April 22, a ministry statement said. Three people have died of fever. Other samples are still being tested, and six people remain hospitalised. “Our country must confront an outbreak of the Ebola virus that constitutes a public health crisis of international significance,” the ministry said. An investigation team led by the ministry of health with WHO support was expected to reach the scene of the outbreak in the coming days, the WHO said. The ministry said it should arrive on Saturday. “It is in a very remote zone, very forested, so we are a little lucky. We always take this very seriously,” the WHO’s Congo spokesman, Eugene Kabambi, said. This latest Ebola outbreak is Congo’s eighth, the most of any country. The deadly haemorrhagic fever was first detected in its dense tropical forests in 1976 and named after the nearby river Ebola. That experience helped Congolese authorities respond effectively to an outbreak in 2014 that killed 49 people. At the same time, a separate outbreak killed more than 11,300 people and infected some 28,600 as it swept through Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and caused alarm around the world. In June last year, WHO declared Liberia free of active Ebola virus transmission. Liberia was the last country still fighting the world’s worst outbreak of the disease. Ebola ‘superspreaders’ accounted for nearly two-thirds of infections, study finds “Our country is full of people well-trained in this matter and our health professionals also helped contain similar epidemics in other countries,” the health ministry said in its statement. The GAVI global vaccine alliance said on Friday some 300,000 emergency doses of an Ebola vaccine developed by Merck could be available in case of a large-scale outbreak and that it stood ready to support the Congo government’s efforts to bring the epidemic under control. Under an agreement between GAVI and Merck, the developer of an Ebola vaccine known as rVSV-ZEBOV, it said up to 300,000 doses of the shot would be available in case of an outbreak. “The WHO and others will determine if and when deployment of vaccine into this outbreak is warranted,” it said in a statement. “There are 300,000 doses of Ebola vaccine available if needed to stop this outbreak becoming a pandemic,” said GAVI’s chief executive Seth Berkley. “The vaccine has shown high efficacy in clinical trials and could play a vital role in protecting the most vulnerable.” SCMP Today: Intl Edition Get updates direct to your inbox.

Three people have died of fever.Other samples are still being tested, and six people remain hospitalised."Our country must confront an outbreak of the Ebola virus that constitutes a public health crisis of international significance," the ministry said.An investigation team led by the ministry of health with WHO support was expected to reach the scene of the outbreak in the coming days, the WHO said. The ministry said it should arrive on Saturday. "It is in a very remote zone, very forested, so we are a little lucky. We always take this very seriously," the WHO's Congo spokesman, Eugene Kabambi, said.This latest Ebola outbreak is Congo's eighth, the most of any country. The deadly hemorrhagic fever was first detected in its dense tropical forests in 1976 and named after the nearby river Ebola.That experience helped Congolese authorities respond effectively to an outbreak in 2014 that killed 49 people. At the same time, a separate outbreak killed more than 11,300 people and infected some 28,600 as it swept through Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and caused alarm around the world. In June last year, WHO declared Liberia free of active Ebola virus transmission. Liberia was the last country still fighting the world's worst outbreak of the disease."Our country is full of people well-trained in this matter and our health professionals also helped contain similar epidemics in other countries," the health ministry said in its statement. The GAVI global vaccine alliance said on Friday some 300,000 emergency doses of an Ebola vaccine developed by Merck (MRK.N) could be available in case of a large-scale outbreak and that it stood ready to support the Congo government's efforts to bring the epidemic under control.Under an agreement between GAVI and Merck, the developer of an Ebola vaccine known as rVSV-ZEBOV, it said up to 300,000 doses of the shot would be available in case of an outbreak."The WHO and others will determine if and when deployment of vaccine into this outbreak is warranted," it said in a statement. "There are 300,000 doses of Ebola vaccine available if needed to stop this outbreak becoming a pandemic," said GAVI's chief executive Seth Berkley. "The vaccine has shown high efficacy in clinical trials and could play a vital role in protecting the most vulnerable."

We like this definition. Mediaplanet’s Clinical Trial campaign found within USA TODAY and online, helps shed light on the importance of clinical trials for medical breakthroughs. New York, NY (PRWEB) May 12, 2017 Mediaplanet today announces the launch of this May’s edition of “Clinical Trials.” This campaign will educate doctors, physicians, nurses, and allied healthcare professionals on the benefits of conducting a clinical trial, while honing in on the proper and most effective ways to improve the process, ultimately leading to an increase in completed trials, treatments, and live saving discoveries. Only around 32% of drugs have a probability into making it to phase 3 trials, and only 1 in 10 drugs actually make it to the market. This means that the time, effort, and dollars that are being spent (800k-1.4B) for clinical trials are not panning out as plan, which causes hesitation in their conduction. There are several factors leading to the incompletion of a clinical trial. Ensuring the clinical trial is planned properly, leads to a higher success rate of the trial.The need for more participants and better planned clinical trials is crucial. The print component of “Clinical Trials” is distributed within today’s edition of USA Today in New York, Boston, Washington/Baltimore, Phoenix, and the Carolinasmarkets, with a circulation of approximately 250,000 copies and an estimated readership of 750,000. The digital component is distributed nationally, through a vast social media strategy, and across a network of top news sites and partner outlets. To explore the digital version of the campaign, click here. Cancer survivor and clinical trial activist T.J. Share graces the cover of the print publication. Through an exclusive interview on the interior, T.J. shares his story on how participating in clinical trials saved his life. T.J. talks about the power of clinical trials and how others can educate themselves on these life-saving studies. T.J. encourages all to consider clinical trials as an option, he says “when it comes down to it, we are all patients at some point, so we should know what all of our options are before making a decisions.” This campaign was made possible with the support of the Center for Information on Clinical Research Participation (CISCRP), Association of Clinical Research Professionals (ACRP), Coalition for Clinical Trials Awareness(CCTA), Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI), QST Consultations, TransCelerate Biopharmaceuticals, Biogen, Merck, Pfizer, Janssen, CureForward, and PerkinElmer.

We like this definition. Mediaplanet and The Center for Information and Study on Clinical Research Participation (CISCRP) have partnered to produce a “Clinical Trials” campaign to help shed light on the importance of clinical trials for medical breakthroughs New York, NY (PRWEB) May 12, 2017 Mediaplanet today announces the launch of this May’s edition of “Clinical Trials.” This campaign will educate doctors, physicians, nurses, and allied healthcare professionals on the benefits of conducting a clinical trial, while highlighting the proper and most effective ways to improve the process, ultimately leading to an increase in completed trials, treatments, and live saving discoveries. Only around 32% of drugs have a probability into making it to phase 3 trials, and only 1 in 10 drugs actually make it to the market. This means that the time, effort, and dollars that are being spent (800k-1.4B) for clinical trials are not panning out as plan, which causes hesitation in their conduction. There are several factors leading to the incompletion of a clinical trial. Ensuring the clinical trial is planned properly, leads to a higher success rate of the trial. The need for more participants and better planned clinical trials is crucial. The print component of “Clinical Trials” is distributed within today’s edition of USA Today in New York, Boston, Washington/Baltimore, Phoenix, and the Carolinas markets, with a circulation of approximately 250,000 copies and an estimated readership of 750,000. The digital component is distributed nationally, through a vast social media strategy, and across a network of top news sites and partner outlets. To explore the digital version of the campaign, click here. Lymphoma survivor and clinical trial activist Jameisha Brown is featured within the publication. Through an exclusive interview with Mediaplanet, Brown shares her story on how participating in clinical trials saved her life. Brown talks about the how the relationship and communication between patient and physician during a clinical trial can be empowering, and that it is more of a collaboration in care, which can go a long way in fighting fear. Brown encourages all to consider clinical trials as an option. This campaign was made possible with the support of the Center for Information on Clinical Research Participation (CISCRP), with special support from their partners, TransCelerate Biopharmaceuticals, Biogen, Merck, Pfizer and Janssen.

FILE: A girl suspected of being infected with the Ebola virus has her temperature checked at the government hospital in Kenema, Sierra Leone, on 16 August 2014. Picture: AFP. Ebola Democratic Republic of Congo Email Print Tweet Share Reuters | 12 hours ago KINSHASA - A person in Democratic Republic of Congo who died of a hemorrhagic fever has tested positive for the Ebola virus, signalling the start of a new outbreak, the Health Ministry and the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Friday. The case was confirmed from tests on nine people who came down with a hemorrhagic fever in Bas-Uele province in the northeast of the country on or after 22 April, a ministry statement said. Three people have died of fever. "Our country must confront an outbreak of the Ebola virus that constitutes a public health crisis of international significance," the ministry said. The WHO's Congo spokesman, Eugene Kabambi, said: "It is in a very remote zone, very forested, so we are a little lucky. We always take this very seriously." This latest Ebola outbreak is Congo's eighth, the most of any country. The deadly hemorrhagic fever was first detected in its dense tropical forests in 1976 and named after the nearby river Ebola. That experience helped Congolese authorities respond effectively to an outbreak in 2014 that killed 42 people. At the same time, a separate outbreak killed more than 11,300 people and infected some 28,600 as it swept through Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and caused alarm around the world. In June last year, WHO declared Liberia free of active Ebola virus transmission. Liberia was the last country still fighting the world's worst outbreak of the disease. "Our country is full of people well-trained in this matter and our health professionals also helped contain similar epidemics in other countries," the health ministry said in its statement, adding that a response team would arrive in the area on Saturday. The GAVI global vaccine alliance said on Friday some 300,000 emergency doses of an Ebola vaccine developed by Merck could be available in case of a large-scale outbreak and that it stood ready to support the Congo government's efforts to bring the epidemic under control. Under an agreement between GAVI and Merck, the developer of an Ebola vaccine known as rVSV-ZEBOV, it said up to 300,000 doses of the shot would be available in case of an outbreak. "The WHO and others will determine if and when deployment of vaccine into this outbreak is warranted," it said in a statement. "There are 300,000 doses of Ebola vaccine available if needed to stop this outbreak becoming a pandemic," said GAVI's chief executive Seth Berkley. "The vaccine has shown high efficacy in clinical trials and could play a vital role in protecting the most vulnerable."

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Antidepressants Market: Positive Marketing Approval for Innovative Medicines Is Likely to Drive the Market in the Near Future Albany, NY — (SBWIRE) — 05/12/2017 — Antidepressants are drugs used for the treatment of depressive disorders including dysthymia, obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety, chronic pain, eating disorders, and neuropathic pain. Depression is a medical disorder which is related to the brain. Symptoms of depression include feeling sad and tired, lacking energy, and having difficulty enjoying routine daily activities. According to CDC, depression affects about 1 in every 5 individuals in the U.S. According to WHO (World Health Organization), at present an estimated 350 million people worldwide are affected by depression. Depression affects 10% to 15% men and about 10% to 25% of women. The antidepressants market has been segmented based on the drug classes commonly used for the treatment of various types of depressive disorders. There are different types of antidepressant drugs available in the market such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (RIMA), tetracyclic antidepressants, etc. The different types of antidepressants are used in the treatment of depressive disorders. The different classes of antidepressants are as effective as each other, but some patients respond better to one antidepressant compared to another antidepressant. Side effects can also be different between these groups of antidepressants. Different types of depression disorders include dysthymic disorder, postpartum depression, psychotic depression, major or clinical depressive disorder, and seasonal affective disorder. Factors driving the antidepressants market are declining side effects and rising efficacy of drugs in various classes as well as growing geriatric population where rate of mental illness is higher. However, the overall antidepressants market growth would decrease due to patent expiry of key antidepressants, fragile pipeline of new drugs, increasing number of generic drug alternatives, and growing prevalence of treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders. Region wise, the global fermented ingredients market is segmented into five regions; North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East & Africa. North America is the most dominant market for antidepressants due to the presence of a large patient population suffering from various types of anxiety disorders and depression. However, the antidepressants market in the U.S. is currently saturated, as several antidepressant drugs are available on prescription for the same indication. Hence, the future growth of the market would depend on introduction of efficacious drugs for new indications. For more information on this report, fill the form @ http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=19037 Moreover, loss of patent exclusivity, market maturity, generic infiltration, and shortened drug lifecycles are the additional factors that contribute to the decline in market growth in the region. Asia Pacific is expected to witness appreciable growth due to multiple factors such as high prevalence of psychiatric disorders and rapid economic growth in countries such as China, Japan, and Australia. Additionally, positive marketing approval for innovative medicines is likely to drive the market in the near future. Currently, the market is highly fragmented and competitive in nature due to the involvement of both large and small pharmaceutical companies. AstraZeneca plc, Eli Lilly and Company, Forest Laboratories, GlaxoSmithKline plc, H. Lundbeck A/S, Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Co., Inc., Pfizer, Inc. and Sanofi S.A. are major companies operating in the antidepressants market. Majority of the market players are focusing on expanding distribution network as well as expanding geographical presence, as Asia Pacific, the Middle East& Africa, and Latin America are developing regions with an increasing prevalence of various types of depressive disorders and improving economic conditions. Differences in clinical efficacy between drugs are generally small because most modern antidepressants work through a common biological mechanism. As a result, drug makers use direct-to-consumer advertising and tweak side effect profiles in order to differentiate their products.

Three people have died of fever."Our country must confront an outbreak of the Ebola virus that constitutes a public health crisis of international significance," the ministry said. The WHO's Congo spokesman, Eugene Kabambi, said: "It is in a very remote zone, very forested, so we are a little lucky. We always take this very seriously."This latest Ebola outbreak is Congo's eighth, the most of any country. The deadly hemorrhagic fever was first detected in its dense tropical forests in 1976 and named after the nearby river Ebola. That experience helped Congolese authorities respond effectively to an outbreak in 2014 that killed 49 people. At the same time, a separate outbreak killed more than 11,300 people and infected some 28,600 as it swept through Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and caused alarm around the world.In June last year, WHO declared Liberia free of active Ebola virus transmission. Liberia was the last country still fighting the world's worst outbreak of the disease."Our country is full of people well-trained in this matter and our health professionals also helped contain similar epidemics in other countries," the health ministry said in its statement, adding that a response team would arrive in the area on Saturday. The GAVI global vaccine alliance said on Friday some 300,000 emergency doses of an Ebola vaccine developed by Merck could be available in case of a large-scale outbreak and that it stood ready to support the Congo government's efforts to bring the epidemic under control.Under an agreement between GAVI and Merck, the developer of an Ebola vaccine known as rVSV-ZEBOV, it said up to 300,000 doses of the shot would be available in case of an outbreak."The WHO and others will determine if and when deployment of vaccine into this outbreak is warranted," it said in a statement. "There are 300,000 doses of Ebola vaccine available if needed to stop this outbreak becoming a pandemic," said GAVI's chief executive Seth Berkley. "The vaccine has shown high efficacy in clinical trials and could play a vital role in protecting the most vulnerable."

And yet, many mainstream media sources, like NPR, have continued to perpetuate the myth that these vaccines are totally safe, effective and incapable of causing harm. However, more people and organizations are waking up to the reality that the HPV vaccine is capable of grievous damage. A new documentary being released by the Alliance For Natural Health – USA (ANH-USA) seeks to change the narrative on HPV vaccines, and highlight the hazardous effects that these inoculations are capable of creating. The documentary will feature a number of medical experts, accomplished doctors and professors in the field who are brave enough to speak out against what they know is wrong. Some of these top authorities include Dr. Sin Hang Lee, who is an expert pathologist who’s worked for Yale University and is currently the Director of Milford Molecular Diagnostics, and a former member of Big Pharma, Laurie Powell — who is now using her knowledge to fight back against the industry. Visit HPVVaxFilm.com for the release of the film, or to view film trailers. In addition to featuring these leading experts on vaccines and the pharma industry, the documentary will also include people who have had their lives shattered by the effects of the HPV vaccine. Some are young women who’ve been harmed by the inoculation, while others are family members who’ve been devastated by the vaccine’s toll. The HPV vaccine does not discriminate, and its victims span across the globe. One woman, Emily Tarsell, tells the heartbreaking story of how her daughter, Christina, passed away suddenly after receiving her third and final dose of the Gardasil vaccine. Other young women, like Taylor Wickline, have survived receiving the vaccine but are left to suffer with the symptoms of vaccine injury. Taylor and her mother, Theresa, have been dealing with the ramifications of the HPV vaccine for the last decade. While most of the documentary focuses on the ill effects of the Gardasil vaccine, it is important to note that the Cervarix vaccine has not fared any better. In Japan, over 100 young women and girls have filed lawsuits against the manufacturers of the two HPV vaccines, Merck (Gardasil) and GlaxoSmithKline (Cervarix). One young woman, a 20-year-old named Erina Sonoda explained that she developed horrible menstrual pains after the second round of Cervarix. Upon getting her third and final shot, that pain began traveling across her entire body — making it difficult for her to perform everyday tasks, including walking. Despite her young age, Sonoda says she now needs a cane, or even a wheelchair on especially bad days, in order to get around. She said the pain was so bad, it felt as if “someone was squashing [her] internal organs.” While some HPV proponents refuse to acknowledge the suffering of people like Erina Sonoda or Taylor Wickline, and many “vaccine believers” seem to think that their experiences are incidental — yet so many women have been harmed, it hardly seems to be a coincidence. As ANH-USA reports, “A quick glance at the CDC’s website reveals significant side effects. The Center received about 22,000 reports of adverse events following Gardasil HPV vaccination from June 2006 to March 2013, with 8% of these reports considered “serious”—among them, 157 deaths and diagnoses of Guillain-Barre Syndrome, encephalitis, brain injury, and seizure (convulsion). This was more side effects reported than for any other vaccine.” ANH-USA’s groundbreaking documentary will serve as a testament to the fact that the HPV vaccine is not the safe, cancer-preventing magic serum it’s been purported to be.

Approvals - Research and Markets News provided by Research and Markets 12 May, 2017, 12:00 ET Share this article DUBLIN, May 12, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Rheumatoid Arthritis Therapeutics in South-East Asia Markets to 2022 - Novel JAK and IL-6 Receptor Inhibitors to Stimulate Moderate Growth Despite Launch of Biosimilars of Blockbuster Anti-TNFs" report to their offering. The advent of biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD) has boosted the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) market tremendously over the last two decades. The South-East Asia market, which for the purposes of this report comprises South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia, is forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.7%, from USD1.04 Billion in 2015 to USD1.44 Billion in 2022. South Korea accounted for most of the market in 2015 with a 29.9% share, followed by Malaysia with 19.0%, the Philippines with 14.2%, Vietnam with 9.4%, Taiwan with 8.5%, Indonesia with 7.1%, Singapore with 6.4%, and Thailand with 5.5%. The entry of new therapies over the forecast period will stimulate market growth. Promising pipeline candidates include Eli Lilly and Incyte's baricitinib, Regeneron's sarilumab, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Johnson & Johnson's sirukumab, Astellas' peficitinib (ASP015K), and AbbVie's upadacitinib. Galapagos' filgotinib is in late-stage development, but it will not be launched during the forecast period, as its Phase III trial completion date is in Q3 2020. The therapeutic market for RA has become extremely competitive owing to the number of new drug approvals. Competition for tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) inhibitors is particularly fierce and now dominates the treatment market for RA patients who are refractory to first-line DMARDs. In 2015, Humira (adalimumab), MabThera/Rituxan (rituximab) and Remicade (infliximab) were ranked among the top-10 best-selling drugs in the world, with global revenue of USD14.01 Billion, USD7.33 Billion and USD6.56 Billion, respectively, reflecting their groundbreaking clinical and commercial success.

The case was confirmed from tests on nine people who came down with a hemorrhagic fever in Bas-Uele province in the northeast of the country on or after April 22, a ministry statement said. Three people have died of fever. Other samples are still being tested, and six people remain hospitalised. "Our country must confront an outbreak of the Ebola virus that constitutes a public health crisis of international significance," the ministry said. An investigation team led by the ministry of health with WHO support was expected to reach the scene of the outbreak in the coming days, the WHO said. The ministry said it should arrive on Saturday. "It is in a very remote zone, very forested, so we are a little lucky. We always take this very seriously," the WHO's Congo spokesman, Eugene Kabambi, said. This latest Ebola outbreak is Congo's eighth, the most of any country. The deadly hemorrhagic fever was first detected in its dense tropical forests in 1976 and named after the nearby river Ebola. That experience helped Congolese authorities respond effectively to an outbreak in 2014 that killed 49 people. At the same time, a separate outbreak killed more than 11,300 people and infected some 28,600 as it swept through Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and caused alarm around the world. In June last year, WHO declared Liberia free of active Ebola virus transmission. Liberia was the last country still fighting the world's worst outbreak of the disease. "Our country is full of people well-trained in this matter and our health professionals also helped contain similar epidemics in other countries," the health ministry said in its statement. The GAVI global vaccine alliance said on Friday some 300,000 emergency doses of an Ebola vaccine developed by Merck (MRK.N) could be available in case of a large-scale outbreak and that it stood ready to support the Congo government's efforts to bring the epidemic under control. Under an agreement between GAVI and Merck, the developer of an Ebola vaccine known as rVSV-ZEBOV, it said up to 300,000 doses of the shot would be available in case of an outbreak. "The WHO and others will determine if and when deployment of vaccine into this outbreak is warranted," it said in a statement. "There are 300,000 doses of Ebola vaccine available if needed to stop this outbreak becoming a pandemic," said GAVI's chief executive Seth Berkley. "The vaccine has shown high efficacy in clinical trials and could play a vital role in protecting the most vulnerable."

Key Market Driver - Research and Markets News provided by Research and Markets 12 May, 2017, 10:45 ET Share this article DUBLIN, May 12, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Breast Cancer Therapeutics in Southeast Asia Markets to 2022 - Increasing Prevalence and Usage of Premium Targeted Therapies to Drive the Market" report to their offering. Breast cancer is a malignant neoplasm that begins in the breast tissue, which is made up of glands for milk production called lobules and the ducts that connect the lobules to the nipples. Most breast cancers are invasive cancers that have grown beyond the ducts or lobules and can metastasize to other parts of the body through the bloodstream and the lymphatic system. In 2012 about 1.7 Million new cases of breast cancer were diagnosed globally, making it the most common cancer in women. Previously the majority of these incident cases occurred in developed regions (such as the US, EU and Australia) while less developed countries (including several of the assessed Southeast Asian countries) had lower incidence. The current market for breast cancer consists of chemotherapies, hormonal therapies and targeted therapies. Herceptin is the gold standard monoclonal antibody (mAb) for the treatment of HER2-positive disease, and is prescribed in nearly all settings. Although it is available in all of the assessed countries, its use is limited in the majority of Southeast Asian countries due to affordability issues, and limitations surrounding the diagnosis of HER2 status. Furthermore, there is currently a very high unmet need in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Treatment has been largely dependent on traditional chemotherapies, which are clinically limited in terms of both efficacy and toxicity. There is therefore a need for more effective treatment options that provide substantial improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Declining Side Effects and Rising Efficacy of Drugs in Various Classes will Drive Antidepressants Market Antidepressants are drugs used for the treatment of depressive disorders including dysthymia, obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety, chronic pain, eating disorders, and neuropathic pain. Depression is a medical disorder which is related to the brain. Symptoms of depression include feeling sad and tired, lacking energy, and having difficulty enjoying routine daily activities. According to CDC, depression affects about 1 in every 5 individuals in the U.S. According to WHO (World Health Organization), at present an estimated 350 million people worldwide are affected by depression. Depression affects 10% to 15% men and about 10% to 25% of women. Browse through Antidepressants Market report to know what factors will shape the market by 2024: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/antidepressants-market… The antidepressants market has been segmented based on the drug classes commonly used for the treatment of various types of depressive disorders. There are different types of antidepressant drugs available in the market such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (RIMA), tetracyclic antidepressants, etc. The different types of antidepressants are used in the treatment of depressive disorders. The different classes of antidepressants are as effective as each other, but some patients respond better to one antidepressant compared to another antidepressant. Side effects can also be different between these groups of antidepressants. Different types of depression disorders include dysthymic disorder, postpartum depression, psychotic depression, major or clinical depressive disorder, and seasonal affective disorder. Factors driving the antidepressants market are declining side effects and rising efficacy of drugs in various classes as well as growing geriatric population where rate of mental illness is higher. However, the overall antidepressants market growth would decrease due to patent expiry of key antidepressants, fragile pipeline of new drugs, increasing number of generic drug alternatives, and growing prevalence of treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders. Region wise, the global fermented ingredients market is segmented into five regions; North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East & Africa. North America is the most dominant market for antidepressants due to the presence of a large patient population suffering from various types of anxiety disorders and depression. However, the antidepressants market in the U.S. is currently saturated, as several antidepressant drugs are available on prescription for the same indication. Hence, the future growth of the market would depend on introduction of efficacious drugs for new indications. Moreover, loss of patent exclusivity, market maturity, generic infiltration, and shortened drug lifecycles are the additional factors that contribute to the decline in market growth in the region. Asia Pacific is expected to witness appreciable growth due to multiple factors such as high prevalence of psychiatric disorders and rapid economic growth in countries such as China, Japan, and Australia. Additionally, positive marketing approval for innovative medicines is likely to drive the market in the near future. Request a sample of this report to know what opportunities will emerge in the rapidly evolving Antidepressants Market by 2024: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Currently, the market is highly fragmented and competitive in nature due to the involvement of both large and small pharmaceutical companies. AstraZeneca plc, Eli Lilly and Company, Forest Laboratories, GlaxoSmithKline plc, H. Lundbeck A/S, Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Co., Inc., Pfizer, Inc. and Sanofi S.A. are major companies operating in the antidepressants market. Majority of the market players are focusing on expanding distribution network as well as expanding geographical presence, as Asia Pacific, the Middle East& Africa, and Latin America are developing regions with an increasing prevalence of various types of depressive disorders and improving economic conditions. Differences in clinical efficacy between drugs are generally small because most modern antidepressants work through a common biological mechanism. As a result, drug makers use direct-to-consumer advertising and tweak side effect profiles in order to differentiate their products.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Rising Global Incidence of Various cancers Boost the Demand for Anti-cancer Drugs Market The World Cancer Research Fund states that in 2012, there were around 14 million new cases of cancer around the world; of these, women accounted for 6.7 million cases and men accounted for 7.4 million cases. This figure is likely to increase to 24 million by 2035. Similarly, according to the World Health Organization, an estimated 8.2 million deaths in 2012 were directly related to cancer and the number of new cancer cases is anticipated to increase by an estimated 70% over the next two decades. Accounting for 13% of the total number of new cases diagnosed in 2012, lung cancer was the most common cancer across the globe, followed by breast cancer (1.7 million new cases), and colorectal cancer (1.4 million new cases). Obtain Report Details @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/anticancer-drugs-marke… Cancer mortality can be reduced if the disease is detected and treated early. Timely and correct diagnosis is key to effective and adequate treatment. Today, the global anti-cancer drugs market can be rightly characterized by the enormous amount of innovation that hopes to transform the landscape for patients, providers, and companies alike. SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) survival statistics reveal that in 1990, only half of all cancer patients lived for five years after diagnosis. This has now increased to two-thirds, a result of gradual but consistent innovation in the anti-cancer drugs market. This research report serves as a blueprint for all stakeholders in the anti-cancer drugs market as it not only gives them a fresh, objective, and accurate perspective of the global industry but also examines the key factors governing its growth from 2016 to 2024, the report’s forecast period. Leading trends, forces driving the growth, and challenges that lie ahead have been discussed at length, supported by appropriate statistics and inputs from industry experts. The rising global incidence of various cancers, including cancer of the breast, prostate, skin, blood, gastrointestinal tract, and lungs, is the primary factor boosting the demand for anti-cancer drugs. In addition to this, the development of advanced therapeutic modalities, such as targeted therapies, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and hormonal therapies has significantly benefited the anti-cancer drugs market in recent years. This market is predicted to benefit from the commercialization of follow-on-biologics and patent expiration of several blockbuster drugs. The threat of failure of the drugs, the high cost involved in the development of anti-cancer drugs, and the possible side effects of these drugs are expected to challenge the expansion of the global market in the coming years. However, rising government funds are likely to reduce the negative impact of these obstacles and continue propelling the anti-cancer drugs market. Make an Enquiry @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Some of the most prominent players in the global anti-cancer drugs market are Celgene Corporation, Eli Lilly and Company, Roche Diagnostics, Novartis AG, Pfizer, Sanofi, Amgen Inc., GlaxoSmithKline PLC, Merck & Company, and Johnson and Johnson. Geographically, the international market for anti-cancer drugs is segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Rest of the World. North America presently surpasses all of the aforementioned regional markets and is likely to retain its leading position throughout the duration of the forecast period. Favorable reimbursement policies, the surge in investments by prominent multinational companies in the research as well as development of anti-cancer drugs, and the high adoption rate of immunotherapies are some of the major factors responsible for the growth of the North America anti-cancer drugs market. Asia Pacific has been identified as a rather lucrative region for the anti-cancer drugs market owing to the rising awareness regarding the availability of advanced therapies. The increase in healthcare expenditure and per capita disposable income is also likely to contribute toward the future expansion of the Asia Pacific anti-cancer drugs market.

The trial results are an unexpectedly early boost for the product, known commercially as Imfinzi, which the company hopes will become a blockbuster drug with sales in the billions of dollars. It sets AstraZeneca apart from rivals Merck and Roche, whose equivalent drugs are years behind in the race for similar treatments against lung cancer. Shares in AstraZeneca extended gains to be up by 9.1 percent by mid-afternoon, the top FTSE 100 riser, hitting its highest level since September 2016 and set for its biggest one day rise since May 2014. Merck fell 1.5 percent, while Roche was up 0.9 percent. AstraZeneca said it was in talks with the authorities over plans for regulatory approval. "These are highly encouraging results for patients with locally-advanced lung cancer for whom surgery is not an option," Sean Bohen, Executive Vice President, Global Medicines Development at AstraZeneca, said in a statement. Analysts said the results of the trial, known as PACIFIC, showed AstraZeneca was ahead of competitors as there was a gap in the market for such treatment. It also augured well for another trial due in mid-2017 which could mean the drug could be used in combination in newly diagnosed cases. "The surprise early positive readout of the PACIFIC trial of... durvalumab (Imfinzi) in locally advanced lung cancer is a major inflection point for AstraZeneca's immuno-oncology," analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a note. "In theory, this could open a market opportunity of $1.75 billion to $3.5 billion (or more) for the drug, which is not included in our current forecasts." RESHAPING THE BUSINESS AstraZeneca is looking to sales of recently launched and experimental cancer medicines to help offset the impact of a loss of patents on blockbusters such as cholesterol pill Crestor. The drug works by helping the body's immune cells kill cancer, offering an alternative to chemotherapy. In this trial it was used after chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Analysts at Berenberg said that trial results, which were earlier than expected, put AstraZeneca ahead of rivals Roche and Merck. The results of their trials for similar treatments aren't expected until September 2019. They also said the efficacy of durvalumab in PACIFIC was a good sign ahead of the results of a trial of the drug in a combination therapy, called MYSTIC. That is used on more advanced cancers, but before or instead of chemotherapy, and results are expected in June or July. "While MYSTIC is still very important, PACIFIC clearly lessens its importance, and provides more reassurance that Imfinzi is an active drug and therefore must have a chance of working in MYSTIC," analysts at Berenberg said. U.S. regulators earlier this month approved durvalumab as a treatment for bladder cancer, marking the first commercial green light for the product.

NEW PRESS RELEASE CATEGORIES ﻿ Health Global Cancer Biomarkers Market is Expected to Reach US$27.63 bn by 2027 Cancer Biomarkers Market - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecast 2017 - 2025   PR-Inside.com: 2017-05-12 11:25:17 Several players operate in the global cancer biomarkers market, catering to niche segment. The global biomarkers market offers a favorable environment for competitors as there are several unique customer segments within the industry, exhibiting demand for distinct product type. However, as market players target multiple pathways, in the near future the market could witness increased competition. Abbott Laboratories, Merck & Co., Inc., Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Illumina, Inc., and bioMérieux SA are among the leading market players, finds Transparency Market Research (TMR) in a new study. Considering the dynamic business environment, a majority of the market players are focusing on achieving greater market share via product differentiation. The research and development spending is thus significantly high in the market. Besides this, several companies are aiming at expanding their footprint through acquisitions and disinvestments. As the companies continue spending on product development and technological advancements, consequently the cancer biomarkers market will witness greater opportunities for growth. According to TMR, the global cancer biomarkers market, which stood at US$10.25 bn in 2016, is expected to reach US$27.63 bn by the end of 2027. If these figures hold true, the global cancer biomarkers market will exhibit a CAGR of 11.8% between 2017 and 2025. By disease indication, the demand for cancer biomarkers was the highest for the treatment of lung cancer, which is likely to hold nearly 25.8% of the market by the end of 2017. Regionally, North America held the dominant share of 42.5% of the global market in 2016. Rising Funding for Cancer Research to Boost Growth Opportunities The market is majorly gaining from the rising discretionary funding for cancer research. Governments across most developed countries are engaged in raising funds for cancer research to aid in diagnosis and research. They are also funding clinical trials for breakthroughs in cancer treatment. As their initiatives gain pace, the cancer biomarkers market will witness greater growth opportunities. Also steps taken by the government to spread cancer awareness will help the market gain momentum. In lines with the same, the demand for cancer biomarkers will therefore rise in response to the rising incidence of cancer worldwide.   To gain a stronger foothold, the leading market players are forging strategic collaborations. They are also keen on acquiring established regional players to expand their geographic footprint. Such strategies adopted by companies will have a positive influence on the market. Besides these, growing acceptance of patients towards innovative technologies and tests and novel product launches will enable the market exhibit strong growth during the forecast period. Make an Enquiry @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_ .. Lack of Awareness to Act as Major Restraint to Growth On the downside, the unwillingness of healthy population to participate in clinical research is acting against the market’s growth prospects. While overall, the incidence of cancer cases is surging around the world, but not many of them have access to proper treatment. This is partly due to the lack of participation in clinical trials and unavailability of patient surveillance systems. Given the scenario, low awareness and ambiguity regarding blood tests such as tumor biomarkers are inhibiting the cancer biomarker market’s trajectory. Also the high attrition rate in product development cycle is restricting the market’s growth to an extent. Nevertheless, with the advent of minimal-invasive diagnostic tests for cancer diagnosis will support the market’s growth in the near future. Minimally invasive diagnosis will provide simple and comparatively less expensive method of detecting cancer. These innovations will bring in fresh opportunities for the market players to capitalize on. Also the market will witness considerable growth opportunities as governments across emerging nations boost their healthcare spending and take steps to deliver healthcare services at par with the international standards. This review is based on a TMR report, titled “Cancer Biomarkers Market (Test Type - PSA Tests, CTC Tests, AFP Tests, CA Tests, HER2 Tests, BRCA Tests, ALK Tests, CEA Tests, EGFR Mutation Tests, and KRAS Mutation Tests; Disease Indication - Breast Cancer, Lung Cancer, Colorectal Cancer, Melanoma, Blood Cancer, Prostate Cancer, Ovarian Cancer, Stomach Cancer, and Liver Cancer) - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecast 2017 - 2025.” About Us Transparency Market Research (TMR) is a global market intelligence company providing business information reports and services.

This may then stimulate the patient’s immune system to attack those cells. It is possible to create a mAb specific to almost any extracellular/ cell surface target. Research and development is underway to create antibodies for diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, Ebola and different types of cancers). Chimeric antibodies are composed of murine variable regions fused onto human constant regions. Humanized antibodies are produced by grafting murine hypervariable regions on amino acid domains into human antibodies. Human monoclonal antibodies are produced using transgenic mice or phage display libraries by transferring human immunoglobulin genes into the murine genome and vaccinating the transgenic mouse against the desired antigen, leading to the production of appropriate monoclonal antibodies. Murine antibodies have short half-life in vivo, limited penetration into tumor sites and inadequately recruit host effector functions.

Collaborative efforts and initiatives to identify therapies for difficult-to-treat illnesses is a key factor driving the overall immune-oncology market. However, high drug pricing, development costs and limited technical expertise are some of the challenges likely to dampen the surging spirit of the market over 2025. Demand for Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors to Remain Robust Currently, immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy is widely used for treating several carcinogenic disorders. Immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs help the body fight against certain proteins that are normally used by various tumors to suppress immune responses. Sales revenue from immune checkpoint inhibitors drugs is anticipated to reach US$ 7,321.7 Mn by 2017-end. Of late, a number immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs have been approved by the US FDA including Yervoy (anti-CTLA-4), Opdivo and Keytruda (anti-PD1) and Tecentriq (anti-PD-L1). Demand for these drugs is expected to further gain traction, owing to a significant investment by biopharmaceutical companies in developing a robust pipeline. Meanwhile, immune system modulator is the second most preferred immune-oncology therapy and is expected to create an incremental opportunity of US$ 659.9 Mn between 2017 and 2025. Two major approved drugs that fall in this category include interferons and interleukins. Based on therapeutic area, demand for immune-oncology therapeutics for melanoma will remain high throughout the forecast period.

Meet the Contributors → Eli Lilly Migraine Drug Hits Study Goals, Paves Way for FDA Filing Frank Vinluan May 12th, 2017 @frankvinluan @xconomy Like Us Xconomy Indiana —  An Eli Lilly drug developed to stop migraine headaches before they can start hit its main goals in a late-stage clinical trial, the company said Friday. With those results now in hand, the Indianapolis-based drugmaker plans to file for FDA approval of the drug later this year. Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) tested its drug galcanezumab in three Phase 3 clinical trials enrolling patients who experienced episodic and chronic migraine headaches. Patients were randomized to receive either the Lilly drug or a placebo. The injectable drug did not stop migraines from developing entirely. But in the three-month treatment period, Lilly says that patients given its drug experienced fewer headaches per month compared to the group that received a placebo—enough to show statistical significance. Lilly says its drug beat a placebo at both the 120 mg and the 240 mg doses. The most common adverse events were reactions at the site of the injection. Migraines affect 38 million people in the U.S., according to the Migraine Research Foundation. A migraine attack can be debilitating, bringing heightened sensitivity to light and sound, as well as a visual disorientation called an aura. Though the aura typically lasts an hour, migraines can last from several hours to several days. Besides the healthcare costs associated with treating migraines, the condition also takes an economic toll. The foundation estimates that lost productivity from migraines costs the U.S. $13 billion annually. Lilly’s clinical trial results give additional validation for a new approach to migraine treatment. For decades, the first-line migraine drugs treated pain after symptoms start. These drugs, called triptans, reduce inflammation and constrict blood vessels. Lilly’s galcanezumab is part of a new class of drugs that work in a different way, interfering with a protein called calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). This protein, which is released by neurons, is thought to play a role in transmitting pain. By blocking this protein, researchers aim to stop the onset of migraine pain. A handful of other companies are also testing drugs that block CGRP. Last year, Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) reported positive results from two clinical trials testing its CGRP inhibitor, called erenumab. After reporting successful results from its second Phase 3 trial last November, the company said it would start preparing its application for FDA approval, which could make the drug the first in this new class to reach the market. Bothell, WA-based Alder Biopharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ALDR) last year reported positive results from a mid-stage clinical trial testing its CGRP inhibitor ALD403. Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE: TEVA) is also evaluating a CGRP-blocking migraine drug, as is Allergan (NYSE: AGN), which two years ago paid $250 million up front to acquire a compound from Merck (NYSE: MRK). Lilly says it will file for FDA approval of galcanezumab in the second half of the year. The company also plans to present data from its migraine clinical trials at scientific meetings and submit the data to peer-reviewed journals. In addition to studying galcanezumab in migraine, Lilly is evaluating the drug as a treatment for cluster headache. The company expects to report results from the Phase 3 cluster headache study next year. Photo by Flickr user kizzzbeth via a Creative Commons license.

The case was confirmed from tests on nine people who came down with a hemorrhagic fever in Bas-Uele province in the northeast of the country on or after April 22, a ministry statement said. Three people have died of fever. "Our country must confront an outbreak of the Ebola virus that constitutes a public health crisis of international significance," the ministry said. The WHO's Congo spokesman, Eugene Kabambi, said: "It is in a very remote zone, very forested, so we are a little lucky. We always take this very seriously." The last outbreak of Ebola in Congo was in 2014 and killed 42 people. The country has been hit by Ebola about nine times in all. Ebola killed more than 11,300 people and infected some 28,600 from 2013, as it swept through Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and caused alarm around the world. In June last year WHO declared Liberia free of active Ebola virus transmission. Liberia was the last country still fighting the world's worst outbreak of the disease. The GAVI global vaccine alliance said on Friday some 300,000 emergency doses of an Ebola vaccine developed by Merck could be available in case of a large-scale outbreak. The vaccine, known as rVSV-ZEBOV, was shown to be highlyprotective against Ebola in clinical trials published lastDecember.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Global Human Vaccines Market: Rise in Awareness Programs Sponsored by For-profit and Non-Profit Organizations a Significant Growth Booster Vaccination has been promoted as a vital public health intervention across the globe for decades. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), vaccination has reduced the global burden of infectious disease to a great extent. An extremely low risk of serious and fatal side effects associated with vaccines and growing awareness regarding vaccination by various government and non-profit organizations are the key factors driving the human vaccines market. The global human vaccines market was valued at US$28.3 bn in 2015 and is estimated to reach US$72.5 bn by 2024, registering an 11.2% CAGR during the forecast period. Extensive promotion and marketing strategies and favorable government support are likely to boost market growth. Browse Market Research Report @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/human-vaccines-market…. Conjugates Dominate Human Vaccines Market by Type On basis of vaccine type, the conjugate vaccines segment accounted for the majority share in the global human vaccines market in 2015. Prevnar, manufactured by Pfizer, Inc., is a conjugate vaccine, which generated a significant revenue of US$6.2 bn globally in 2015 alone. This is a key factor contributing to the dominance of conjugates in the human vaccine market. However, the growing preference for commercial brands available in the market is likely to drive the combination vaccines segment. The pneumococcal segment accounted for the majority share in the global human vaccines market by product. A large number of products are commercially available in the market and the prevalence of pneumonia is high across several regions. These factors have been known to drive the pneumococcal segment. By age group, pediatric vaccines accounted for a 57.5% share in the global human vaccines market in 2015. Factors such as the high prevalence of pneumonia and polio among children across the world are likely to fuel this segment. On the other hand, adult vaccines are expected to expand at the highest CAGR from 2016 to 2024. By distribution channel, the hospital pharmacies segment accounted for the lion’s share in the global human vaccines market. However, the drugstores segment is projected to expand at a considerable CAGR during the forecast period owing to a dramatically increasing vaccination rate in standalone pharmacies in the U.S. Strong Government Support Benefits Markets in APAC, LATAM, and Africa North America was the dominant market for human vaccines in terms of revenue in 2015 owing to the growing demand for vaccination among adults and children. The market is also fueled by the increase in government efforts toward vaccination programs and the fact that most vaccines are available in the U.S. For more information on this report, fill the form @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Asia Pacific is expected to register the strongest growth in the market for human vaccines. Increasing government efforts toward immunization for various diseases such as polio, flu, rotavirus, and typhoid has been boosting the market. A massive population base is also likely to fuel market growth, especially in China and India. China is likely to dominate the Asia Pacific human vaccines market during the forecast period owing to a large population base and growing government support toward vaccination. Brazil is likely to be the leading market for human vaccines in Latin America by 2024. A large population base, growing healthcare infrastructure, and a rise in subsidiaries for industry participants are the major factors boosting the human vaccines market in Brazil.
