BLRX, -4.55% (tase:BLRX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to identifying, in-licensing and developing promising therapeutic candidates, today reports its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2016. Highlights and achievements during second quarter of 2016 and to date: Submission of regulatory filings to initiate Phase 2a study in pancreatic cancer for BL-8040 in combination with Merck's KEYTRUDA [®] , under immuno-oncology collaboration with Merck announced earlier this year Signing of additional immuno-oncology collaboration, this time with MD Anderson Cancer Center, for second Phase 2a study in pancreatic cancer for BL-8040 in combination with Merck's KEYTRUDA Continued enrollment in large (n=194), randomized Phase 2b study for BL-8040 as consolidation treatment for AML patients following standard induction treatment  Commercial launch of BL-5010 as OTC treatment for non-surgical removal of skin lesions by Omega Pharma (a division of Perrigo), following CE Mark approval in March In-licensing of liver fibrosis project under Novartis collaboration Philip A. Serlin appointed Chief Executive Officer, effective October 2016 Expected upcoming significant milestones for remainder of 2016: Initiation of Phase 2a study in pancreatic cancer, under immuno-oncology collaboration with Merck, following expected regulatory approval in Q3 2016 Second Phase 2a immuno-oncology study in pancreatic cancer, under collaboration with MD Anderson Cancer Center, expected to commence by end of 2016  Full set of data from Phase 2a study for BL-8040 in r/r AML to be presented at the Society of Hematologic Oncology (SOHO) annual meeting, September 7-10, 2016, in Houston, Texas   Partial results from Phase 2 study for BL-8040 in stem-cell mobilization for allogeneic transplantation expected by end of 2016 Regulatory submission for BL-7010 clinical efficacy study, for marketing purposes as food supplement Expansion of commercial rollout of BL-5010 by Omega to additional countries and development of 2 [nd] OTC indication for the product   Philip A. Serlin, Chief Financial and Operating Officer of BioLineRx, remarked, "The second quarter of 2016 highlighted the continued execution of our plans as we advance and expand our lead oncology platform, BL-8040; see the initial market penetration of BL-5010; continue the development of BL-7010 as a food supplement, and maintain active asset screening and in-licensing activities with Novartis. "We are pleased to have entered into an immuno-oncology collaboration with MD Anderson for a second Phase 2a study of BL-8040 with Merck's KEYTRUDA in pancreatic cancer, which provides additional validation of the potential of our lead oncology drug platform in the cancer immunotherapy space. We continue to examine other potential collaborations in this space. In addition, we are looking forward to announcing full results from our successful Phase 2a study for relapsed and refractory AML at the upcoming Society of Hematology Oncology Meeting in September and we continue to push forward in our Phase 2b trial in an earlier treatment line for AML as a consolidation treatment following standard induction treatment. We also look forward to initiating our Phase 2a study in pancreatic cancer under our collaboration with Merck, expected by the end of this quarter," added Mr. Serlin. "BL-5010, our first product in the market, is already being sold in a number of countries in Europe. Omega Pharma plans to continue to gradually launch the product in additional European countries over the next 6-9 months, and beyond that time frame, to additional territories. To date, we have not recorded material revenues from this collaboration, but we expect revenues to gradually increase as the first product launch expands and the second product launch commences. In addition, we have in-licensed a drug candidate for the treatment of liver fibrosis, specifically nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), under our strategic collaboration with Novartis for the co-development of selected Israeli-sourced novel drug candidates, and we expect to in-license additional promising projects to the collaboration in the next few months," continued Mr. Serlin. "In closing, we ended the second quarter with $41.8 million of cash on our balance sheet. With our focus on achieving our expected milestones, we remain well positioned to carry out our strategic and operational plans," Mr. Serlin concluded. Financial Results for Second Quarter Ended June 30, 2016 Research and development expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 were $2.7 million, a decrease of $0.2 million, or 5.2%, compared to $2.9 million for the comparable period in 2015. The small decrease resulted primarily from lower spending on BL-7010 in the 2016 period, partially offset by increased spending related to clinical trial preparations for BL-8040. Research and development expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were $5.3 million, a decrease of $0.8 million, or 13.5%, compared to $6.1 million for the comparable period in 2015. The decrease resulted primarily from lower expenditures for BL-7010 during the 2016 period, as well as the conclusion of one of the clinical trials for BL-8040 in 2015. Sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 were $0.3 million, similar to the comparable period in 2015. Sales and marketing expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were $0.5 million, similar to the comparable period in 2015. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 were $0.9 million, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 12.5%, compared to $1.0 million for the comparable period in 2015. The small decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in salary-related payments and depreciation. General and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were $1.8 million, similar to the comparable period in 2015. The Company's operating loss for the three months ended June 30, 2016 amounted to $3.8 million, compared with an operating loss of $4.2 million for the corresponding 2015 period. The Company's operating loss for the six months ended June 30, 2016 amounted to $7.6 million, compared with an operating loss of $8.5 million for the corresponding 2015 period. Non-operating income (expenses) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 primarily relate to fair-value adjustments of warrant liabilities on the Company's balance sheet. These fair-value adjustments, which were not material in the 2016 periods, are highly influenced by the Company's share price at each period end (revaluation date). Financial income (expenses), net for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 primarily relate to investment income earned on bank deposits, as well as banking fees. The decrease from 2015 to 2016 reflects a lower cash balance and a continued reduction in global investment yields. The Company's net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2016 amounted to $3.7 million, compared with a net loss of $4.8 million for the corresponding 2015 period. The Company's net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2016 amounted to $7.2 million, compared with a net loss of $9.1 million for the corresponding 2015 period. The Company held $41.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term bank deposits as of June 30, 2016. Net cash used in operating activities was $7.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared with net cash used in operating activities of $7.1 million for the comparable period in 2015. The $0.3 million increase in net cash used was primarily the result of a decrease in trade payables and accruals. Net cash provided by investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $4.2 million, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $17.9 million for the comparable period in 2015. The changes in cash flows from investing activities relate primarily to investments in, and maturities of, short-term bank deposits and other investments during the respective periods. Net cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $1.5 million, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $28.6 million for the comparable period in 2015. The decrease in cash flows from financing activities reflects the underwritten public offering which was completed in March 2015.

A high-profile failure in lung cancer patients punished Bristol-Myers Squibb's invetors and rewarded Merck & Co.'s investors. Todd Campbell (TMFEBCapital) Aug 10, 2016 at 6:40PM Image source: Getty Images. Bristol-Myers Squibb's (NYSE:BMY) Opdivo failed to deliver the goods in a key lung cancer trial, causing Bristol-Myers' shares to plummet. The failure also prompted investors to rush into Bristol-Myers Squibb's competitors, including Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK). which markets Keytruda, a drug that works similarly to Opdivo. Does Opdivo's disapointment make Merck a better buy than Bristol-Myers?  Squaring off Opdivo and Keytruda are already approved for use in previously treated non-small cell lung cancer patients (NSCLC) who have seen their disease return after chemotherapy, and both companies are studying if their drugs are effective in previously untreated patients. Merck reported data from a trial evaluating Keytruda instead of chemotherapy in previously untreated NSCLC patients in June, and the results were good enough that independent monitors recommended Merck's trial be halted early so that patients in the chemotherapy arm of the study could be offered Keytruda.  The positive outcome of that trial sparked optimism that Bristol-Myers' trial of Opdivo in previously untreated NSCLC patients would similarly pan out. Both Keytruda and Opdivo inhibit PD-1 to keep cancer from hiding from the immune system. Unfortunately, investor optimism for Opdivo's trial proved to be unwarranted. Opdivo failed to significantly delay disease progression relative to chemotherapy, clearing the way for Keytruda to have the first-line NSCLC treatment market to itself. Digging into the details Keytruda's win and Opdivo's loss in untreated NSCLC patients may say more about the relationship of PD-1 expression and the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors than it does about these individual drugs. That's because the two trials were designed quite differently from one another. The Keytruda study only involved patients with very high PD-L1 expression, while Opdivo's trial included patients with both low- and high-levels of PD-L1 expression. Specifically, Keytruda's results came from its use in patients with PD-L1 expression equal to or greater than 50%, while Opdivo's results came from its use in a patient pool with PD-L1 expression greater than 5%. Since Opdivo's trial included results from both low- and high-expressing patients, the biggest takeaway from these diverging trial results is that PD-1 inhibitors efficacy appears to be highly correlated to PD-L1 expression. Obviously, we won't know if that's true for sure until we see full results from Opdivo's trial (Bristol-Myers Squibb plans to release more information at a key conference later this year), but it wouldn't surprise me if Opdivo's efficacy in patients with 50% or greater PD-L1 expression matches up with Keytruda's. Image source: Bristol-Myers Squibb Irons in the fire Even if the full analysis of Bristol-Myers Squibb's trial doesn't show that Keytruda's advantage over Opdivo was due to trial design, Keytruda's potential to be the go-to in this indication could be short-lived. Bristol-Myers Squibb is conducting a trial that combines Opdivo with another one of its immunology drugs, Yervoy, and with chemotherapy, and those approaches may yield better response rates and progression-free survival data than Keytruda monotherapy. In June, Bristol-Myers Squibb presented phase 1b results showing that 57% of lung cancer patients in the Opdivo/Yervoy combination arm responded to the treatment, including 92% of patients with PD-L1 expression of 50% or higher. Results from a phase 3 trial of this combination could be available as early as 2018. Although results can vary widely from indication to indication for drug combinations, the use of Opdivo/Yervoy in first-line metastatic melanoma is already the single most prescribed therapy in the U.S. for that indication. Additionally, AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) is developing its own PD-1 drug, durvalumab, and phase 3 studies combining durvalumab with another AstraZeneca drug, tremelimumab, in NSCLC could be available in 2018, too. Tying it together Non-small lung cancer represents 85% of the 224,000 lung cancer diagnosis every year in the U.S., and with five-year survival rates of less than 18%, there's a big, unmet need for new treatment options that work better. The size of the NSCLC patient population and the fact that Opdivo and Keytruda carry six-figure price tags mean a lot of money is at stake in the indication, and therefore, Opdivo's trial failure shouldn't be ignored. However, investors may want to keep the positive impact for Merck of this failure in perspective, especially given all the ongoing R&D in the indication. Overall, while this is clearly a short-term win for Merck, the long-term winner has yet to be determined. Todd Campbell has no position in any stocks mentioned.

He is now engaged in advanced cancer surgery.” (Photo: Bill Denison/Drew University ) By Patricia Harty, Editor-in-Chief August / September 2016  The Irish-born biologist and parasitologist William Cecil Campbell, who was awarded the 2015 Nobel Prize in Medicine, talks to Patricia Harty. ℘℘℘ For those of us fortunate enough to turn a simple tap to take a nice relaxing bath or long hot shower, it’s hard to imagine risking the loss of your eyesight for a single bucket of water. But for centuries, onchocerciasis, commonly known as river blindness, had plagued remote communities in Africa, Latin America, and Yemen. Lifelines for villagers, the rivers are breeding grounds for black flies that, infected with a parasite worm, transmit the disease through repeated biting. In return, those infected transfer the disease to uninfected flies who bite them, resulting in a plague characterized by extreme itching and eventual blindness. That the simple chore of getting water in these communities is no longer as much of a danger as it had been for generations is due to William “Bill” Campbell, an Irish-born scientist who, with his colleagues at Merck Research Laboratories, discovered a novel therapy for treating the disease. In 2015, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, sharing it with Satoshi Ōmura of Japan. One wonders why it took so long. It was in the late 1970s when, working with a batch of microbe strains that Ōmura sent over for evaluation, Campbell developed a drug using ivermectin (later named Mectizan) and suggested it would work for river blindness in humans. Not only did the drug work, it also proved effective against the parasite that causes elephantiasis (so-called because of the elephant-like appearance of swollen limbs in severely affected cases), which co-exists with river blindness in many places.

Several countries in Africa are making significant progress towards eliminating both diseases. In Latin America, three countries – Colombia, Ecuador, and Mexico – have effectively eliminated river blindness. Campbell, who at 86, is fit and trim with twinkling eyes, a keen mind, and self-effacing wit, is also decidedly modest about his Nobel Prize.

(Copyright © Nobel Media AB 2015 Photo: Dan Lepp) “I think of it as an award in which I’m the representative of the Merck company’s research teams,” he said in one of several phone conversations that I had with him over the summer, prior to a meet up in Cape Cod, where he and his wife, Mary, children (two daughters and a son), and five grandchildren had gathered for a vacation in early August. The respite is a welcome break from all the attention that being a Nobel laureate has brought. He had settled into retirement in North Andover, MA, enjoying time with Mary (they met at a church function in Elizabeth, NJ over 50 years ago), his three-times weekly doubles ping pong games, solitary kayak trips in early morning, an occasional hike up nearby half-mile hill, and painting and writing poetry that reflects his passion for roundworms and other kinds of parasitic worms.

(Copyright © Nobel Media AB 2015 Photo: Pi Frisk) A true Renaissance man who can turn his hand to any number of things, Campbell likes to keep it simple. In fact, the title of his Nobel Lecture, “Ivermectin: A Reflection on Simplicity,”could serve as a mantra for the man himself. More than anything, the now world-famous biologist and zoologist, is a naturalist who espouses nature-based remedies for curing diseases. He told Adam Smith, the chief scientific officer of Nobel Media, “there is a certain amount of hubris in humans thinking that they can create molecules as well as nature can create molecules in terms of the diversity of molecules, because nature consistently produces molecules that have not been thought of by humans.” Campbell’s appreciation of nature is rooted in his childhood. He grew up in Ramelton, a small farming town in County Donegal, with two older brothers and a younger sister. The town is situated on mouth of the River Lennon, in one of the most beautiful and remote spots in Ireland. His parents, Sarah Jane Campbell (née Patterson) of Dunfanaghy, and R.J. Campbell of Fanad, ran a general store, supplying farmers. His father also farmed, raising shorthorn dairy cattle that won prizes at agricultural shows. And it was at an agricultural show that 14-year-old Campbell picked up a leaflet on fluke worms in sheep that, in hindsight, may have influenced his interest in becoming a scientist.

(Copyright © Nobel Media AB 2015 Photo: Alexander Mahmoud) But then Campbell could just as easily have become a writer, an artist or a historian. His teacher during his formative years, Miss Martin, “instilled a love of learning, not in the sense of a chore to be mastered, but getting the satisfaction of knowing something, and remembering something. She had a tremendous influence on me,” he says. Desmond Smyth, the renowned parasitologist, who was Campbell’s science professor at Trinity College, was another key influencer. “He changed my life by developing my interest in parasitic worms,” he says. After graduating with first class honors in zoology from Trinity, Campbell went on to the University of Wisconsin–Madison where he earned a Ph.D. in 1957 for work on liver fluke in deer. Headhunted by Merck out of school, he stayed with the company for over 30 years developing many significant drugs, including a treatment for trichinosis. William C. Campbell and his wife, Mary, showing the Nobel Medal during their visit to the Nobel Foundation on December 12, 2015. (Copyright © Nobel Media AB 2015 Photo: Alexander Mahmoud) After his retirement from Merck, Campbell taught undergraduate biology and graduate history at Drew University until 2012. Nowadays, he often begins lectures by showing a picture of his ­father’s cows. “Of course it has ­absolutely nothing to do with the lecture, but I like to tell people where I’m from because it is such a part of me,” he says. When I remark that he still has a hint of an Irish accent after all this time in America, he laughs. “After about three days in Donegal with my family, Mary says it comes back.” And that will be soon. In September, Campbell will be honored by IT Sligo and then go home to Ramelton for a town reception. “My brother, Bert, said he’ll make sure that there will be time for family picnics on Marble Hill beach,” Campbell, his eyes lighting up at the prospect, says. “His lovely mother used to put together such wonderful picnics for us,” Mary adds. Campbell agrees. “I was very lucky to have a great mother and a great father.” He pauses for a moment, verklempt. “That’s one of those things about the Prize – you wish they were around.”  ℘℘℘ You have lived here a long time. Do you feel more American than Irish as the years go by? Well, I feel both and that may seem strange. I never ceased to feel Irish but I also feel American. I am proud to be American and I am proud to be Irish and proud to be a citizen of the U.K. Tell me about growing up in Donegal? My father started with a little grocery shop and built it up over his lifetime into a general merchant store selling farm equipment, hardware, kitchen utensils, and chinaware – just about everything. Sometimes the farmers would come in at lunch time when the shop would be closed but my father would always get up, much to my mother’s distress, and go out and talk to farmers. It wouldn’t have occurred to him not to open the shop for some farmer who had maybe come in from a long distance. He was a natural entrepreneur and businessman. He also farmed. He just loved to do that. He grew a lot of potatoes and oats, and raised dairy cattle. He used to take his purebred dairy shorthorns to shows. One thing that sort of typified my father, was that he brought electricity to the town. He hired people to set up the poles and the wires to bring electricity to the whole town. He bought this big generator – the engine room that housed it was behind our house. When we were in bed, we could hear this generator going through its paces before it settled down into a steady rhythm. People in those days who had battery-powered radios would bring them to my father’s shop to get them charged. Then after the war, he bought three or four smaller diesel-fueled generators. I had wonderful parents. My mother was saintly. I don’t use “saintly” in a religious or liturgical sense, though she was devout, but rather to convey a sense of her profound goodness. She was very caring. I never heard her say a bad thing about anyone.

(Photo: Kit DeFever) Has your life changed since the Nobel Prize? There is no way you can stop it from changing your life because there is just a constant barrage of invitations and letters and emails and requests. And while they are all wonderful to have, there are just so many of them and I am now very ancient and have no secretary or manpower or secretarial skills, it is stressful for me. Whether I say yes or no, it is just a constant preoccupation, especially if the invitation is from someone I know, and I have a lot of speeches to give and lectures to write. The Nobel experience itself was just out of this world, and then to meet the President of the United States was a great honor. I think the main positive is being contacted by people you haven’t been in touch with for many, many years and to know that people still remember you. In fact, the most positive thing is that people actually enjoy hearing about it. They actually get pleasure out of talking to someone who had [the Nobel] experience. I understand that as a boy, you became interested in science after picking up a leaflet on Fluke worms in sheep at an agricultural show. One of the things that has happened with the prize, it is that I find myself telling the same story and even writing it. Only in retrospect, did I find it intriguing that I only remembered one thing about that show, and that happened to be a leaflet about a parasitic worm that I took home with me. I didn’t think, “Aha! This is what I want to study.” The decision came gradually, and it all really stemmed from Desmond Smyth, my professor at Trinity College. He was a fantastic man, the sort of teacher who changes people’s lives. He was very encouraging and engaged me in the study of parasitic worms. How did the decision to go to Trinity College come about? At that time and place, if you were a Protestant you went to Trinity, or perhaps to Queen’s University Belfast. If you were a Roman Catholic you tended to go to University College Dublin, or University College Galway or Cork. That is the reality of how it was at the time. One of the things I liked when I came to this country was what I naïvely perceived to be a lack of prejudice because people didn’t seem to know by looking at me whether I was Protestant or Catholic. Whereas in Ramelton, if a new person moved to town, everyone knew, before they even got there, whether they were Protestant or Catholic. It was ridiculous, but that is the way it was. How did you end up at the University of Wisconsin? As I was nearing graduation, a professor at the University of Wisconsin wrote to Smyth in Dublin. They knew each other’s work, and as a result of this contact, I applied to do research and graduate studies at Wisconsin. When I got there, my professor had a project on liver fluke that he and his department were working on. This was the giant liver fluke that is very pathogenic in deer and sheep, so it turned out to be the perfect spot for me. And this led to a job at Merck? Yes. The head of parasitology at Merck wrote to my professor at Wisconsin to see if there was anybody just finishing their PhD that he might recommend. I looked at the map of northern New Jersey and decided (unfairly, of course) that it didn’t look appealing. But my professor said, “Just go there and have the experience and stay in New York.” So that is what I did. It turned out that seeing the work being done at Merck, and meeting the people there, intrigued and impressed me. When I got back to Wisconsin, there was a letter offering me a job. Ivermectin, as well has having a huge impact on human diseases, has also made a difference in veterinary practice. How did it come about? Yes. I meet a lot of veterinary practitioners who tell me that. [The discovery] was a long process of finding a drug that worked against some worms, and then testing it against other worms, and following up with more testing, and more experiments. That involved a lot of hard work and a lot of persistence. Knowing enough about worms to draw analogies between the different types, and where they live and what they do, was a key factor. Parasite Window, 1992, featured in Campbell’s book, Poem, Paint and Pathogen. Was it a huge eureka moment when you realized that the treatment for parasites in horses might be used to treat humans? No, it wasn’t. I was very conscious of human worm diseases. While still at Merck, I was lecturing at New York Medical College on human parasitic worms. And I had been in South America on an Inter-American Fellowship in Tropical Medicine. So there was never a eureka moment for me. When you discover something active, you have a sort of subdued excitement because the chances are overwhelming that it is going to fall by the wayside. The vast majority turn out to be too toxic or too unstable or too stinky… But, on the other hand, there certainly were moments that were more important than others, some things that would shift the trajectory a bit, and therefore we might call them inflection points; certainly I am thinking about the horses here. Can you talk about the river blindness trials? I read that you persuaded Merck to make the drug available for free in poor countries. First of all, let me say that the trials were carefully done by the Merck medical people working with French tropical medicine experts in Africa. Any trial that is a first trial in humans has to be very cautious but this was out of the ordinary in terms of being cautious. And when it worked, there was some serious skepticism on the part of leading authorities that had do with people being susceptible to particular drugs and particular life stages being more dangerous to treat than other life stages, in terms of hypersensitivity, reactions and so on. But Merck decided to go ahead despite the skepticism and set up its own trials and not rely on some big international agency. And again, it worked just wonderfully well and the question then was what to do with it. As a pharmaceutical company, it would have been nice to sell it at a profit, but those most affected lived in poor countries, so there was no way people were going to get it unless it was donated. And this decision was decided by the chairman and CEO of the company in collusion with a handful of three or four top associates, and I was not one of them. To my mind, they are the ones, and the only ones, who deserve credit for that donation. What else have you worked on? As a parasitologist, I have had the privilege of interfacing with both human and veterinary medicine because parasites are so important to both. There is one particular disease that I spent an enormous amount of time on and that is trichinosis, the one you get from eating under-cooked pork. I gave a talk at George Washington University, in D.C., in March and at the end of the lecture, a young fellow put up his hand and said, “I heard that you once gave Scotch whiskey to pigs. Can you confirm that?” And I said, “I never in my entire life gave Scotch whiskey to pigs. I gave them Irish whiskey!” I fed the pigs seven-year-old John Jameson whiskey because of reports that alcoholic beverages would prevent trichinosis, and published a paper on it. And did it work? Yes, but you would have to drink an awful lot of it. It would be a very expensive and hazardous cure. Humans affected with trichinosis get tremendous fever and pain – pigs don’t get either. You can give them enough [trichinosis] to eventually kill them with infection, but they never get the fever. What are your thoughts on using animals in research? I don’t dismiss it lightly. In biomedical research we say that it is justified because it is to benefit humans. I realize for some people that is not enough. I can certainly respect the difficulty that people have with it. A number of years ago a British member of parliament tried to get a bill passed that all medicines in which animals were used in the research would have to carry a label saying, “Animals were used in developing this product.” The bill never got passed but I think it would have made people stop and think, “Okay, I’m against the use of animals in research. Do I take the drug or be noble and say ‘no,’ even if it’s going to cure me?” There is a big focus now on using one’s own autoimmune system to target disease. Yes, and some of it has to do with worms. There is a connection between early childhood worm infections and a stronger immunity. You can cure some diseases by infecting the person with worms. In Mexico, for a couple of hundred dollars you can become infected with worms as a cure for irritable bowel syndrome. You can get the treatment in London. It hasn’t caught on here because people are put off by the idea of worms. Most of the research is being done on the fringe. Established researchers won’t touch it. You have spent your whole career developing chemical answers to disease — but you’ve said that we need to look to nature for cures. Yes, absolutely. I believe that. We need to look at the immunological response and other biological approaches rather than chemical contrivances. We need to continue to work on other ways of interrupting life cycles and disrupting transmission of disease. One would hope that eventually [chemicals] would be replaced but certainly we are not anywhere near that yet, except in certain cases such as virus diseases. In terms of the Prize, you like to give credit to others, saying the discovery was a team effort. Right, that is really important. I’m a representative of the Merck company’s “team of teams” – parasitologists, chemists, microbiologists, and toxicologists. If there was a problem or an obstacle in one department, somehow it was solved. As obstacles arose, they got resolved. And of course, there was a lot of good fortune…things went better than one had any right to expect. How do you stay fit and mentally alert? The thing that I cling to, no matter how busy I get, is playing doubles ping-pong three times a week. It is very energetic and requires a lot of mental focus. I also kayak early in the morning. I love the serene atmosphere. When you have the lake all to yourself, it is such a source of refreshment. And of course, it’s good physical exercise as well. Also, I paint and write poetry. Those are things that you can keep on doing. Well, the painting you can keep doing. The poetry seems to be something that is either there or not there. From your paintings and your poetry, I have come to the conclusion that you love worms.­­­­ Yes. I consider them beautiful. They are just doing their own thing and not meaning to be destructive. And I have said in some recent papers that the objective is not to get rid of parasitic worms, the objective is to get rid of parasitic diseases. One of your worm paintings actually looks like a stained- glass window. Yes. Several of them do. It is always the same stained glass window. One last question — as a scientist and as a person, do you believe in the afterlife? Ah. I cannot answer that. I have a very fuzzy but very important religious faith – you know, from growing up in a Christian household. When I say I can’t answer that, it is not just that I don’t want to (although I don’t want to) but it is because I don’t have an answer that satisfies me. I don’t believe in heaven with a big-bearded God and Saint Peter with a big keys at the gate and stuff. I am not a literalist in terms of religious faith. I am very liberal. In fact, I am a very fuzzy-minded person when it comes to those things… But I can’t let go of the belief that there’s something there.

Tweet   The Most Recent Top Six Medical Conspiracy Cover-Ups Exposed! The most recent Top Six Clinical Conspiracy theories Exposed!   Miracle Alternatives, LLC   Medical Conspiracy Cover-Ups Exposed!   (EMAILWIRE.COM, August 11, 2016 ) Chicago, - IL - The mainstream media is focused this week on attempting to persuade you that "clinical conspiracy theory concepts" are wacky and incorrect. Released by Reuters, UNITED STATE Today and various other conventional media outlets, a fake tale based upon distorted exploration is currently attempting to encourage you that there is no such point as a "clinical conspiracy." No, drug companies never performed experiments on kids, killing various at the same time. No, the NIH never took part in scoundrel medical experiments on detainees. No, the United States government never lied to you, or covered natural cures, or conspired with remarkable Pharma. GMOs were established by people who LIKE the environment, as well! That's the rubbish we're all supposed to believe, according to the mainstream media. By conjuring up the expression "conspiracy theory concepts," junk science authors and corporate-sellout journalists attempt to marginalize real record of incredible Pharma felony criminal offenses, medical experiments on children, valid government collusion with market and the remarkable damage which has actually been carried out on the American individuals by the medical industrial made complex. In fact, the mainstream media's insurance coverage of all this is certainly Orwellian, as if the Ministry of Reality is aiming to revise U.S. record to eliminate all the components where medicine companies, the NIH and the United States government quite absolutely murdered detainees, blacks, infants and soldiers for "scientific treatment.". I refuse to gloss through the history of REAL clinical conspiracy theories and all the lives lost to the damaging quest of medical profits at the cost of human dignity. So to address the mainstream media's delusional effort to gloss via the genuine history of real clinical conspiracy theories, we have actually assembled the leading 10 REAL clinical conspiracy theories along with links to resources. Read and find out real record the mainstream media is trying to erase! Top 10 REAL #medical #conspiracies. # 1) Pfizer habits clinical experiments on Nigerian children - In 2009 (and in succeeding years, as follow-up), we reported on just how gigantic medicine manufacturer Pfizer was bought to make up Nigerian families after performing unlawful clinical testing that left ratings of Nigerian children either hurt or dead:. The instance started in 1996, when Pfizer essential a human trial to profit authorization for its brand-new antibiotic Trovan. When an infective disease of meningitis, cholera and measles broke out in Kano, Nigeria, the company promptly assembled an expedition team and flew them to that country. Pfizer set up an outdoor tents right near the clinical terminal where medical professionals Without Borders were providing totally free treatments and recruited 200 kids to become part in an unlicensed medicine trial. Moms and dads mention they weren't told that proven medications were being dispersed just backyards away, that their kids were being enrolled in a medicine trial, or that pet researches had actually advised that Trovan can create liver and joint pain. Eleven of the 200 youngsters in the study died, and parents declare that experienced mind hurt, body organ failing and various other serious negative effects. # 2) illegal rate fixing to cheat the American people and state governments from billions - Apparently, the significant Government/ tremendous Pharma cabal in Washington would certainly have you believe that medicine manufacturers just have your absolute interests in mind, not their revenues or power. As a matter of fact, for several years drug makers have typically conspired to participate in unlawful rate repairing, as confirmed by numerous legal actions and court. As I at one time reported:. In what is currently the major criminal scam negotiation ever to bulge of the pharmaceutical sector, GlaxoSmithKline has begged guilty and accepted pay $1 billion in criminal penalties and $2 billion in civil penalties going after a nine-year government investigation right into its jobs. According to UNITED STATE government detectives, GlaxoSmithKline:. - Consistently paid off medical professionals with deluxe trips and paid talking gigs. - Made medicine safety and security data and lied to the FDA. - Defrauded Medicare and Medicaid out of billions. - Tricked regulators about the efficiency of its medicines. - Relied on its misleading techniques to gain billions of dollars supplying potentially unsafe medications to innocent customers and medical patients. And this is merely the part they got captured doing. GSK does not also reject any of this. The business quickly paid the $3 billion appropriate, apologized to its buyers, and proceeded conducting business as usual. # 3) Vaccine manufacturers realeased their vaccines were killing individuals - One of Merck's leading designers understood that the firm's polio vaccinations were heavily infected with carcinogenic viruses. The scientist, Dr. Maurice Hilleman, may be heard reviewing it in this stunning video. He and various other "scientist" associates are really heard on the recording giggling about the fact that the stealth viruses would eliminate individuals. The mainstream media has never ever reported on this vital item of medical history for the reason that it would subject the reality about injections. # 4) Merck misstated injection proof - A pair of previous virologists publicly claimed that the firm conspired to commit vaccine expedition fraud through the spiking of human blood examples with pet antibodies. As we reported in 2012:. The previous Merck virologists compete that the multivalent mumps component has a greatly boiled down efficacy which is essentially responsible for mumps outbreaks all through the last decade which prompted global calls for MMR booster injection every 4 - 8 years ... By blending the extremely low degrees of human antibodies with animal antibodies, a much higher total level of virus neutralization was acquired compared to could develop from human antibodies alone. The human antibody degrees alone would never secure in the real life contrary wild mumps. But after adding pet antibodies, the human blood examples which had at once fell short under the old "gold requirement" screening were retested making use of the "boosted" methods and passed with flying shades. New 'enhanced' examinations revealed ONE HUNDRED% effectiveness, not in contrast wild mumps virus, but in contrast the mumps vaccination virus. # 5) UNITED STATE government collusion to dedicate medical murder - In just what must shock all Americans to discover, the government-funded National Institutes of Health and a number of medication companies conspired to behavior illegal medical experiments on prisoners held in Guatemalan jails. Head of state Obama was in fact compelled to provide a public apology for this wrong greater than sixty years after it occurred. As Natural Information at one time reported:. The U.S. government intentionally moneyed and purposefully participated in criminal clinical experiments contrary Guatemalan prisoners from 1946 - 1948, which individuals took part in these criminal offenses were then promoted to high ranks of impact in the clinical area. A minimum of 5,500 individuals were composed into the experiments, this consists of kids, females and the mentally ill. The number intentionally infected with sexually-transmitted diseases (Sexually transmitted diseases) went beyond 1,300 (that we know of). Victims weren't even informed they were being polluted with Sexually transmitted diseases. The whole experiment was a private procedure relating to a confessed conspiracy theory between tremendous Pharma and the U.S. government. Obvious proof has actually currently emerged that the doctors and clinical researchers associated with the experiment actively took steps to hide exactly what they were doing. # 6) Conspiracy theory to classify poisonous chemicals "fluoride" and get the public to drink them - It is a historical reality that the fluoride and oral sectors have actually conspired to misguide individuals right into believe "fluoride" is a conveniently happening substance. The truth is, the fluorine compounds made use of in the public water supply are surely by-products of plant food processing or phosphate mining procedures, and they commonly contain heavy metals. Even many mainstream scientists currently end that fluoride reduces IQs and ruins the brain celebration of youngsters. So why are we still being suggested that fluoride is a "public health step" that assists everybody? Go to any common council or various other government company choosing on whether or not to fluoridate your regional supply of water, and you'll get health officials insisting that fluoride is all-natural, and hence safe. They do not trouble to say that quickly taking place fluoride is calcium fluoride, while right stuff bought by neighborhoods to fluoridate their water is salt fluoride, a substantially hazardous mix of hexafluorosilicic acid and salt silicofluoride.

11, 2016, 08:02 ET Share this article KENILWORTH, N.J., Aug. 11, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The increased attention on water sanitation issues in Rio has raised a lot of questions about water-related illnesses from people worldwide. To help inform the public and increase prevention awareness, the Merck Manuals today released a list of waterborne illnesses that people tend to overlook in the United States, leaving them vulnerable to diseases caused by bacteria and microscopic parasites. Originating in oceans, lakes, rivers or pools, these hidden dangers can cause illnesses that range from uncomfortable and inconvenient to life threatening. To shed light on these dangers, infectious disease specialist Dr. Larry Bush has identified five waterborne illnesses to be aware of when heading to the water and key steps to preventing them on MerckManuals.com: 1. Giardiasis is an infection of the small intestine caused by the parasite Giardia, which lives in fresh water. The most common parasitic intestinal infection in the United States, Giardia can be present even in clean-appearing mountain streams, so hikers are at risk. Symptoms typically appear one or two weeks after infection and include abdominal cramps, gas and watery diarrhea. If you think you have Giardiasis, make an appointment with a doctor, who will likely ask for a stool sample. Treatment typically involves a course of antiparasitic drugs. 2. Shigellosis is an infection caused by the bacteria Shigella. An estimated 500,000 people in the U.S. develop the infection every year from water contaminated with human waste and inadequately chlorinated pools. Individuals don't have to ingest very much water contaminated with Shigella to become infected. Symptoms include fever and diarrhea along with painful abdominal cramps. More severe infections may lead to dysentery – frequent bowel movements that may contain blood, mucus and pus. Treatment for Shigellosis includes fluids with salt and antibiotics for more severe cases. 3. Vibriosis is an infection caused by about a dozen Vibrio bacteria. Cholera is the most serious illness caused by the bacteria, but is not very common in the U.S. Noncholera Vibrio bacteria live in warm salt water or mixed salt and fresh water, like bays. Most noncholera Vibrio infections are intestinal infections caused by consuming inadequately cooked shellfish (especially oysters) harvested from contaminated waters. People can also develop Vibrio skin infections if they have an open cut and swim in contaminated water or cut themselves on a crustacean that harbors vibrio. Vibriosis causes 80,000 illnesses each year in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control. Symptoms include diarrhea, cramping, nausea, vomiting, fever and chills. Treatment is limited to drinking lots of water to replace lost fluids. 4. Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a group of bacteria that normally reside in the intestine of healthy people. However, some strains can cause infection, the most common being E. coli O157:H7. It can be contracted by swallowing inadequately chlorinated water that's been contaminated by the stool of infected individuals, for example in public pools. Symptoms, primarily diarrhea and cramps, begin about three days after exposure. For E. coli 0157:H7, treatment is usually limited to administering fluids, and symptoms typically resolve within eight days. 5. Primary Amebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM) is an infection of the brain caused by the Naegleria fowleri amoeba. The amoeba lives in warm fresh water throughout the world and enters the brain by traveling up nerves from the nose. PAM is rare, only 138 people have died from it since 1962, according to the CDC, however it has recently made headlines in the U.S. When the amoeba reaches the brain, it causes inflammation, tissue death and bleeding. Symptoms, which appear within one to two weeks, include a change in smell or taste, headache and stiff neck, sensitivity to light, nausea and vomiting. The infection moves fast, often causing death within 10 days. Keys to prevention The most effective prevention strategies go hand in hand with good overall health – make sure all vaccinations are up to date, drink only properly treated water and practice good personal hygiene. But there are more specific steps you can take before, during and after you go in the water to limit the risk. Before you go in the water: Check for official updates on the condition of the water and advisories warning people not to swim. Inspect water for signs of bacteria or algae, which can cause skin irritation. Avoid swimming in water where babies are wearing diapers or people have open cuts. Shower to wash away any bacteria on you. During your time in the water: Avoid swimming with open cuts – even waterproof bandages do little to prevent bacteria entering a wound. Swallow as little water as possible. It's all right to open your eyes – eyes are mostly impervious to bacteria in the water. After you get out of the water: Take a shower immediately. If you do contract an illness, alert the pool, township, park, etc. as quickly as possible with as many details as possible.

By Amy Feldman Biography October 18, 2014 When markets are turbulent, as they’ve been lately, there’s something to be said for sticking with funds that have a long history of downside protection. Franklin Mutual Global Discovery (ticker: TEDIX), which has $26 billion in assets and a 22-year history of buying undervalued stocks, is one such fund. “Obviously, the names change, and the world changes, but our fundamental approach is very consistent,” says co-manager Peter Langerman, who is also Franklin Mutual Advisors’ CEO. The fund’s strategy, since the days when Mutual Series was run by Max Heine and legendary value investor Michael Price, has involved searching for companies, wherever they might be, that trade at a discount to what the managers figure is their intrinsic value.

Langerman and his co-managers—Philippe Brugère-Trélat and Timothy Rankin—aren’t afraid to be activists, pushing holdings to reallocate capital or make other changes to their businesses, and they’re not averse to waiting. Turnover, at 24%, is well below that of the fund’s world-stock peers, according to Morningstar. The fund’s results have been especially good in down markets, such as 2001, though performance tends to trail rival funds during rallies, as occurred in 2012. Over the past five years, Franklin Mutual Global Discovery has returned an average annualized 8.6%, versus 6.5% for the MSCI World Index. Barron’s visited the managers in their Short Hills, N.J., office, to see where they’re finding opportunities today. The global fund’s exposure to U.S. stocks has continued to climb—U.S. stocks now make up 52% of the portfolio, up from just 14% five years earlier. But they’re also finding value in global energy companies and European banks. The fund also has a cash stake of 9%, giving it the flexibility to move quickly as deals come up. Until the recent selloff, Langerman said, the fund had been trimming and getting out of positions that were approaching their target valuations. “It’s harder today than it’s been for a while,” he said then. But as the market has tumbled, it has created a better environment for these value managers to buy—and they’re searching out new ideas and adding to existing equity and debt positions on the cheap.

Sources: Morningstar; MSCI; Franklin Templeton Langerman, 59, and Brugère-Trélat, 64, have been running the fund since 2009; Rankin, 42, became a co-manager in 2010. But all three have been at the firm for many years. Langerman, a onetime bankruptcy attorney, joined the firm in 1986 as an analyst. Brugère-Trélat joined two years earlier, after French President François Mitterrand nationalized the private bank where he had been working. Rankin, 42, arrived at the firm in 1997 after a stint as an equity analyst. Today, the trio is finding opportunities in energy, which represents 10% of holdings, and includes Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A) and Apache APA 1.8248759404514168% Apache Corp.

Both are restructuring plays, snapped up during difficulties. “We don’t want to just make a commodity bet,” Langerman says. At Shell, for example, the managers wrote a letter to the management and board, and held follow-up calls. Today, they’re heartened by Shell’s new CEO, Ben van Beurden, who has committed to selling assets and cutting investment spending. In Europe, the managers historically owned food, drink, and tobacco stocks, but today, they’re finding better deals in financials, especially the banks. “There was a perception that the European banks were behind the curve in adapting to the new market environment, compared with the U.S. banks, both in terms of balance-sheet size and capital ratios, but there has been a tremendous change in the way banks have managed those two issues over the past two years,” says Brugère-Trélat, who also manages the Franklin Mutual European fund (TEMIX). The Global Discovery fund owns banks in France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Italy, including BNP Paribas BNP.FR -1.279676713251389% BNP Paribas S.A.

While clouds still loom in Europe’s low growth, many of Europe’s best banking franchises are cheap, he says. “We like very solid retail-oriented banks that are trading at a significant discount, relative to American banks. Where else can you find banks trading at a discount to book?” The trio also likes some U.S. financials, such as large banks, including Citigroup C 0.6180035650623886% Citigroup Inc.

It’s a little bit over book value at this point, and it’s got low-double-digit earnings growth per share. And they’re still in the midst of their restructuring.” Mergers and acquisitions have begun to pick up amid low growth and low interest rates, Langerman says. “We’ve been quite active,” he says. That activity has included controversial tax inversions, in which one company buys another based in a lower-tax country, with the intention of moving the joined firm’s headquarters there.

Distressed companies, historically a larger part of the fund, have been a tougher bet recently as default rates among corporate bonds have stayed at low levels. “We’re looking, and they’re chunky,” Langerman says. “It’s like M&A: You’re not doing anything, and then all of a sudden, there’s a huge deal and you can put $500 million to work. You just have to be there and be able, ready, and willing to act.” With a few billion in cash on hand, the ability to move quickly shouldn’t be a problem.

With the cloud of severe pricing legislation starting to lift some, investors are focusing on fundamentals and near-term catalysts that could provide a tailwind for some of the biotech leaders. In a series of recent research reports from the analysts at Jefferies, they pointed to companies with specific catalysts that could have a tremendous impact on shares. Three companies show up on the radar that all have the potential to move big for shareholders. Biogen Jefferies is very bullish on this large cap biotech, and the stock is down over 30% from highs that were printed in March of last year. Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB) discovers, develops and delivers to patients worldwide innovative therapies for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, hematologic conditions and autoimmune disorders. Founded in 1978, Biogen is one of the world’s oldest independent biotech companies, and patients worldwide benefit from its leading multiple sclerosis (MS) and innovative hemophilia therapies. While many on Wall Street acknowledged in the past that the company’s core MS drug market is facing challenges going forward, with most diagnosed patients now treated, payers limiting net benefits from price increases and competing entrants expected. With those issues in mind, the firm is still positive on Tysabri, especially for secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis, with upcoming clinical data a big factor. Biogen posted outstanding earnings in July and the stock has rallied sharply on rumors of a buyout by a large pharmaceutical company. The Jefferies analysts think the company is indeed a legitimate takeout candidate and cite Pfizer, Shire and Roche as companies that could be buyers, in addition to Merck and Allergan. They note that the potential to be a neuroscience bolt-on, the company’s consistent operating cash flows from the MS business and the recent CEO departure as all positives for a potential suitor. The Jefferies price target for the stock is $319, and the Wall Street consensus target is $333.60. The stock closed Wednesday at $308.87 per share.

Kaufman was indicted Wednesday, Aug. 10, 2016 for stealing from a series of clients between 2009 and 2014. (Dale Omori, The Plain Dealer) Print Email John Harper, cleveland.com By John Harper, cleveland.com The Plain Dealer Email the author | Follow on Twitter on August 10, 2016 at 4:00 PM, updated August 10, 2016 at 4:01 PM comments CLEVELAND, Ohio -- A Cuyahoga County grand jury indicted a former Cleveland attorney Wednesday for stealing money from his clients. Paul Kaufman, 67, is charged with 41 felony counts including theft and forgery. He resigned from his law practice in 2015 after numerous clients filed complaints with the Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection. Victims were awarded $189,000 out of the fund. Kaufman, of Shaker Heights, now faces prison time if convicted of stealing from 15 clients. The attorney won the clients more than $215,000 in a class action settlement with drug maker Merck in 2009, the Cuyahoga County prosecutor says, but failed to distribute the funds to the plaintiffs in the settlement. Previously: Former Shaker Heights attorney's clients reimbursed for $189,000 "Attorneys like Paul Kaufman are why so many people look down on the legal profession," Assistant County Prosecutor James A. Gutierrez wrote in a news release. "He chose to ignore his responsibilities as a lawyer and to cheat his clients, and now he is going to have answer for those crimes." The Ohio Supreme Court suspended Kaufman's law license last year. In its order, the court writes that Kaufman "has engaged in conduct that violates the Ohio Rules of Professional Conduct and poses a substantial threat of serious harm to the public." Calls to Kaufman's listed phone number were not answered Wednesday afternoon. He is scheduled to be arraigned in Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas on Aug. 24.

Soptelean The Valley Banner ELKTON — Mold found throughout the Elkton Municipal Building led the town council to close the historic building last week. With councilmembers Joshua Gooden and Jeff Jones absent during an emergency meeting on Wednesday, Aug. 3, council voted 4-0 to move the employees out of the building as soon as possible. Town staff were relocated to space in the Elkton Area Community Center on Blue and Gold Drive on Thursday, Aug. 4. As of Monday, about half of the computers and other equipment had been moved, Printz said. During the emergency meeting, council heard from Mike Delaney, owner of Servpro in Harrisonburg. Delaney was hired after a pipe burst and flooded the basement of the municipal building and forced the town’s Police Department to relocate to the EACC three weeks ago. The municipal building, which was built in 1840 for Dr. Simeon B. Jennings and served as a Confederate hospital during the Civil War, is located between Rockingham Street and Spotswood Avenue. It was donated to the town by Merck & Company in 1964. “There’s mold on all levels of the house, and there probably has been for ... years. It will be quite expensive to do everything that building needs,” Delaney said, adding that it can be fixed but wondered if council should spend the money to do so. “How much money do you want to put into that old house?” he asked. Delaney said the town’s insurance with the Virginia Municipal League covers $15,000 for mold, but added that the town would have to spend additional money to fix the problem. “Most of the walls in the basement need to be taken down,” he said. The town has not yet received an estimate on the repairs, but Public Works Director Troy Shifflett guessed it would cost around $200,000 to rebuild walls in the basement and set up a barrier outside. He said that mold was being spread throughout the building by an old air conditioning unit. In response to questions from council about how the mold would affect town employees, Delaney said everyone reacts differently, i.e. some are affected and some aren’t. “The Harrisonburg city offices were pretty bad for a long, long time in their old building,” he said. Delaney recommended town employees wear an N95 mask when inside the building. Such a mask can be purchased from Lowe’s or Home Depot, he said, adding that events can still be held outside the building. Air scrubbers could be seen and heard buzzing and blowing air out of the basement on the building on Tuesday, Aug. 2, during a National Night Out event, which was held on the building’s porch and lawn facing Rockingham Street. In response to a question from Councilman Gerry “Bootie” Comer, Delaney said the town can sell the historic building without fixing it as long as it notifies the buyer of any issues. “People sell houses all the time as is,” he said. The value of the 1.37-acre property at 173 W. Spotswood Ave. is $559,300, according to the Rockingham County GIS website. That includes $120,000 for the land and $439,300 for improvements. “God gave us this opportunity to fix this thing,” Printz said, referring to the water pipe that burst. He added that protecting the town’s employees is the council’s top priority. The property is one of the few remaining architectural treasures left in our community, Printz said. “The building will not be harmed in any way and will be respected for the historical significance and personal fondness we all have for it,” he said via email. “Town council members and I are carefully considering every option moving forward and are eager to hear input from residents and civic organizations regarding the next chapter for one of Elkton’s most beloved landmarks,” he added.

He is credited with founding the field of femtochemistry, which probes the mechanics of chemical reactions using laser pulses lasting just tens of femtoseconds (1 femtosecond is 10–15 s). An Egyptian-born US citizen working at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, Zewail was the first Arab to win a science Nobel. He championed science education and research in his native country and founded the Zewail City of Science and Technology, a university that opened its doors to students in 2012 near Cairo. Raheb Homavandi/Reuters Iran executes scientist Shahram Amiri, an Iranian nuclear scientist, has been hanged for espionage, his country’s officials announced on 7 August. Amiri said that he had been abducted by the CIA during a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia in 2009, and taken to the United States to be interrogated and tortured. But the US government denied that, and US media alleged that he had been a paid informant who defected voluntarily. He returned to Iran in 2010 and was later convicted of passing secrets about Iran’s nuclear activities to the United States. Iran has maintained that its nuclear programme has only peaceful purposes. Amiri was reportedly an isotope researcher at the Malek-Ashtar University of Technology in Tehran. RESEARCH Cancer drug fails A promising lung-cancer drug failed in a key clinical trial, sending stock in the drug’s developer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, tumbling by 17% on 5 August. The drug, called Opdivo (nivolumab), is one of a suite of new cancer therapies that release immune responses against tumours by blocking a protein called PD-1. Opdivo has been shown to benefit some people with advanced cancers, including lung cancer. But Bristol-Myers Squibb, which is based in New York City, announced last week that Opdivo had failed as a front-line therapy for lung cancer. Stock in a competing firm, Merck of Kenilworth, New Jersey, rose 10% after the news. Turkish purge The Turkish research agency TÜBİTAK in Ankara has removed 139 staff from their posts, pending investigations into their possible connections with the Gülen movement, which President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan claims was behind the country’s attempted coup last month. A further 28 staff have resigned, according to statements by Turkish science minister Faruk Özlü on 5 August. TÜBİTAK, which helps to design the country’s research policy and distributes grant money, has previously been purged. In 2014, agency engineers were dismissed after they declared that incriminating recordings of allegedly tapped telephone conversations between Erdoğan and his son — which Erdoğan said were fabricated — were not manipulated. Mosquito trial The US Food and Drug Administration announced on 5 August that a proposed Florida field test of genetically modified mosquitoes poses few risks to the environment or human health. The announcement clears the way for the board of the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District to allow the release of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes carrying a gene that kills the insects’ offspring, in an effort to control diseases they transmit, including dengue and Zika viruses. Local residents will vote in a non-binding referendum, currently slated for November, before the board decides whether to go ahead with the trial. POLICY Data push-back A coalition of researchers has rebuffed a proposal to share clinical-trial data rapidly. In February, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) proposed that clinical-trial leaders should make the de-identified patient data that underlie a journal article public within six months of publication. The 282 signatories to an article published on 4 August in The New England Journal of Medicine said that the ICMJE proposal was too burdensome and would have unintended consequences, such as delaying publication of results (N. Engl. J. Med. 375, 405–407; 2016). They said that researchers should have at least two years — but up to five — to make data public. US climate rule The White House released a sweeping new climate policy on 2 August, instructing all federal agencies, from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of Transportation, to consider the impacts of their actions on climate change from now on. The agencies are also required to quantify those impacts, mainly in terms of greenhouse-gas emissions. The policy comes from the White House Council on Environmental Quality, which was established in 1969 to advise agencies when they are preparing environmental-impact statements. EVENTS Private Moonshot A private mission to the Moon has been approved for the first time, by the US government. Moon Express, a company in Cape Canaveral, Florida, announced on 3 August that it had been given permission to travel beyond Earth’s orbit and put a robotic lander on the Moon in 2017. Moon Express was founded in 2010 by three technology entrepreneurs, and is one of the companies competing for the Google Lunar XPRIZE; the competition will award US$20 million to the first company to land a privately funded spacecraft on the Moon. Moon Express is yet to finish building its MX-1 lander (pictured, artist’s impression). Courtesy of Moon Express Missing vaccines An investigation by the Associated Press has reported that 1 million yellow-fever vaccines sent in February by the World Health Organization and its partners to tackle a large outbreak in Angola cannot be accounted for. Six million vaccines were sent in total. Of those that can be traced, some were sent to regions where there was no yellow fever; others were improperly stored, or arrived without the syringes to administer them, according to the 5 August report. The agencies involved have responded that a wastage of around 10% is expected in mass-vaccination campaigns for yellow fever — and Angolan officials have denied that any vaccines went missing. Goodnight Yutu China’s moon rover Yutu, or Jade Rabbit, was officially declared dead by state officials on 3 August. It arrived on the Moon in December 2013, and was intended to carry out a three-month exploration of the lunar surface, but it survived for more than two years before going dark for the last time. The six-wheeled, solar-powered rover was struck by mechanical difficulties in early 2014, but had already used its penetrating radar to probe the structure of the lunar soil to a depth of more than 100 metres, and sent back data and high-resolution images to Earth. The mission made China the third country to land a craft on the Moon, after the United States and the Soviet Union. APS moves meeting A division of the American Physical Society (APS) has voted to move its 2018 annual meeting from its originally planned location of Charlotte, North Carolina, as a result of a state law, enacted in March, that forces transgender people to use only toilets that correspond to their sex at birth. The chair of the APS Division of Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics said that it wanted to “provide a welcoming environment for all members”. The APS, which made the statement on 4 August, will hold its conference in Florida instead. Zika in Cuba Cuba has discovered two cases of locally acquired Zika-virus infection, the nation’s health ministry announced on 4 August. The country’s preventive campaigns had been largely successful in staving off infections, with only 30 imported cases identified in Cuba this year, and only one previous locally transmitted case, in March. On 3 August, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) launched the first clinical trial of a Zika vaccine, which it plans to test in 80 healthy volunteers. NIH officials say that the vaccine will probably not be ready for deployment until 2018. FUNDING Climate-cut U-turn Australia’s government has ordered its national science agency to re-prioritize basic climate research, six months after the organization unveiled controversial plans to slash jobs in the sector. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) will — on government instructions — create 15 new climate-science jobs and receive an extra Aus$37 million (US$28 million) over the next 10 years, science minister Greg Hunt announced on 4 August. But the intervention may have come too late to repair damage already caused, researchers say. See go.nature.com/2akgeyp for more. TREND WATCH Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are the rising stars of model-organism research, an analysis of grants from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) finds. A team at the NIH Office of Portfolio Analysis used text mining and manual searching to assess successful applications for R01 awards, the NIH’s main grant programme for individual investigators. Whereas the proportions of grants allocated to zebrafish and Caenorhabditis elegans studies rose between 2008 and 2015, the fraction for research with Xenopus frogs fell.

"Following" : "Follow"}} August 11, 2016 3:02pm   Comments Share: Related BIIB Eli Lilly's Solanezumab Failure Is Bad News For Biogen 20 Stocks Moving In Wednesday's Pre-Market Session Dow Hits High, Nasdaq Dips, Dollar Sets New 13-Year Best (Investor's Business Daily) Biogen Inc (NASDAQ: BIIB) continues to dominate the biotech M&A rumor mill this month. On Thursday afternoon, chatter spread that the company had canceled out of Citigroup's 11th Annual Biotech Conference. Benzinga reached out to a spokesperson at Biogen, who confirmed that the company did cancel out of the conference. The spokesperson said there was a scheduling conflict, and that Biogen executives would be in an all-day meeting. The company will be attending a Morgan Stanley conference the following week. This cancellation comes on the heels of some M&A rumors at the beginning of the month. On August 2, Biogen shares were halted on volatility, as the Wall Street Journal reported the company was drawing interest from Merck & Co. (NYSE: MRK) and Allergan plc (NYSE: AGN). The following day, Reuters reported Biogen had "not received any formal expressions of interest from suitors and is not soliciting offers." Rumors continued the week after on August 8, when Dealreporter suggested Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) may be showing interest in Biogen. Shares of Biogen traded recently at $314.03. Posted-In: News M&A Events Exclusives Best of Benzinga © 2016 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

Here's how the two biotechs stack up. Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) Aug 11, 2016 at 10:45AM Image source: Getty Images. At first glance, the choice between Inovio Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:INO) and Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY) seems like a no-brainer for biotech investors. Incyte has the bigger market cap, more revenue, and that nice little thing called profits. But could the smaller up-and-coming biotech stock actually be the better buy? Let's take a look. The case for Inovio You're not going to buy Inovio's stock based on its financial results. What revenue the company makes stems largely from grants and collaborations. Inovio lost over $18.7 million in the second quarter.  The biotech's pipeline, however, should (and does) interest many investors. Inovio's lead candidate is cervical dysplasia immunotherapy VGX-3100. Phase 2 testing of VGX-3100 found that just under half of the 167 patients in the study experienced regression from high grade to low grade cervical dysplasia or no disease. Over 40% of patients experienced regression to low grade or no disease, plus human papillomavirus (HPV) clearance. These positive results seem to position Inovio well for the next stage of testing. The company has worked with the FDA and European Medicines Agency to clear the path to begin pivotal late-stage testing in the fourth quarter of this year. Assuming all goes well, VGX-3100 could reach peak annual sales of around $500 million. And if VGX-3100 proves to be successful, that should be good news for another Inovio candidate: INO-3112. Inovio is partnering with AstraZeneca's (NYSE: AZN) MedImmune division on developing the vaccine targeting cervical cancer and head and neck cancer. INO-3112 combines VGX-3100 with a DNA-based immune activator encoded for interleukin 12 (IL-12). Inovio boasts an extraordinarily deep pipeline for a biotech its size. The company has three other cancer vaccines in early-stage testing, plus nine vaccines for infectious diseases, including Ebola and hepatitis B. But the pipeline candidate attracting the most attention is Inovio's experimental Zika vaccine. The company announced in May that its Zika vaccine had produced robust immune responses in monkeys. That major step paved the way for Inovio to begin phase 1 testing in humans in July. Interim results from this study are expected later this year. The case for Incyte While Inovio's stock has soared over 30% so far this year, Incyte shares are down more than 20%. A double whammy of bad news caused the drop. First, in January Incyte discontinued a phase 2 study of Jakafi in treating colorectal cancer. Second, the company stopped another phase 3 study of the drug in treating pancreatic cancer. On a positive note, Jakafi's sales continue to soar for its already-approved hematological indications. Incyte reported that revenue for the chemotherapy increased 52% year over year in the first half of 2016. Despite the setbacks earlier this year, the company still expects Jakafi to reach peak annual sales of $1.5 billion. Incyte has two other potential blockbuster drugs waiting in the wings. Phase 3 results for rheumatoid arthritis drug baricitinib were great, with patients reporting better quality of life metrics compared to industry-leading Humira. Analysts think baricitinib could hit peak annual sales of $3 billion. Incyte's partner Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) stands to keep much of the revenue, but Incyte should receive royalty payments of around $1 billion if all goes well. The company expects to obtain regulatory approval for baricitinib in early 2017. Another candidate, epacadostat, could eventually become an even bigger winner for Incyte than baricitinib or Jakafi. A phase 3 study of epacadostat and Merck's Keytruda for treating advanced or metastatic melanoma is currently in progress. Four other clinical trials are also underway for epacadostat in treating various other cancers. Analysts project the drug could reach peak annual sales of over $3 billion. Better buy Both of these biotechs have a lot going for them. Which is the better buy? Inovio currently has no products on the market. The company's lead product, VGX-3100, has yet to begin late-stage testing. There's still some risk that the immunotherapy won't win regulatory approval. Other Inovio candidates, while promising, are still at best several years away from commercialization. Incyte, on the other hand, already has a big winner with Jakafi. It seems likely that baricitinib will win approval based on its phase 3 results. Although there's more risk with epacadostat since the drug is still in late-stage testing, I think the odds for approval are pretty good. Even with some uncertainties, there's no question in my mind that Incyte's pipeline has less risk overall than Inovio's does. I like Inovio, but my pick as the better buy in this case is Incyte. Better financials. Less pipeline risk. Those are two good reasons to invest in Incyte. Keith Speights has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Black and white wallpapers for macOS and iOS   skip to main content skip to main menu     Apple bolsters its Health team by re-hiring Flipboard co-founder Evan Doll By Christian Zibreg, Aug 11, 2016 Tweet Leave a Comment Evan Doll, former Senior iPhone Engineer who left Apple a few years ago to co-found popular social news reader app Flipboard, has been re-hired by the Cupertino firm to help advance Apple’s health-related initiatives. Bloomberg first caught wind of Doll’s re-hiring this morning, based on his recently updated LinkedIn profile revealing his new position at Apple: Director of Health Software Engineering. He starter at Apple last month, as per LinkedIn, which doesn’t expand further on his role. During his nearly-six-year tenure at the Cupertino firm as Senior iPhone Engineer from 2003 to 2009, he helped develop the original iPhone’s operating system before leaving the company to co-found Flipboard with Mike McCue. He left Flipboard in September 2015.

Meet the Contributors → Heron Gains FDA Support For Nausea Drug After A Year Under Review David Holley August 10th, 2016 @xconholley @xconomy Like Us Xconomy San Francisco —  The decision that Heron Therapeutics has been waiting on for almost a year is finally in: The FDA has approved the Redwood City, CA-based company’s drug for nausea and vomiting associated with certain chemotherapy regimens. Heron (NASDAQ: HRTX) first submitted a new drug application for the treatment, granisetron (Sustol), to the FDA in September 2015. The regulatory agency extended its expected decision date three times, most recently in April. Now, with the approval in hand, Heron says it hopes to begin selling the drug in the fourth quarter of this year. Granisetron is an extended-release, injectable drug that aims to help cancer patients—particularly those with breast cancer—deal with both immediate and delayed nausea and vomiting resulting from chemotherapy, for up to five days. The drug works to counter the side effects of a couple of the most commonly prescribed types of chemotherapy, such as anthracycline and cyclophosphamide combinations, Heron says. The company’s stock rose about 9.8 percent from yesterday’s closing price, to $21.80, as of 9:57 a.m. in New York. Waltham, MA-based Tesaro won approval in September 2015 for another anti-nausea drug being sold as rolapitant (Varubi), which ran into trouble after it missed clinical goals in the first two of its three late-stage trials. The company’s third attempt at a Phase 3 trial hit all of its primary and secondary goals, as Xconomy previously reported. There are a number of other drugs that aim to aid patients with chemo-induced nausea, including Merck’s aprepitant (Emend) and palonosetron (Aloxi), which is marketed and distributed by Japanese pharmaceutical company Eisai. In its news release, Heron says it aims to make granisetron stand out by noting its ability to potentially protect patients for up to five days. In particular, Heron says that other drugs, “including palonosetron, are generally effective for 48 hours or less.” On the palonosetron website, the drug is touted as being used to treat nausea on the day of chemo, as well as up to five days following chemotherapy. Heron didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on pricing of the newly approved drug. David Holley is Xconomy's national correspondent based in Austin, TX.

Pharmaceutical companies usually are involved in a lengthy process in getting their drug candidates to market through clinical trials. There is a fair amount of risk involved, should a study come back negative or a candidate not be approved. Conversely, if a drug is approved or passes a clinical trial, there can be big upside. Drug prices may be under pressure due to the campaign rhetoric and under scrutiny, but if generic drugs are going to keep increasing in market share of existing drugs, then there would seem to be a reason for owning major pharmaceuticals. The July 29 short interest data have been compared with the previous figures, and for most of the selected pharmaceutical stocks, short interest was down. A reminder: short sellers betting against big pharma are taking on an added risk. They have to pay out the ongoing high dividends on top of the cost of borrowing the shares. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) saw its short interest increase slightly to 47.81 million shares from the previous 47.67 million. Shares of Pfizer closed Tuesday at $35.08, within a 52-week trading range of $28.25 to $37.19. Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) had a fall in short interest to 28.37 million shares, from 32.06 million in the previous period. Its shares closed Tuesday at $62.49, in a 52-week range of $45.69 to $64.00. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE: TEVA) short interest decreased to 20.81 million shares. The previous level was 22.34 million. Shares closed Tuesday at $53.45, in a 52-week range of $48.01 to $70.09. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (NYSE: BMY) saw its short interest decrease to 14.06 million shares from the previous reading of 17.42 million. Shares closed Tuesday at $61.61, within a 52-week range of $51.82 to $77.12. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV) short interest fell to 50.88 million shares, compared to the previous 60.57 million. Shares of AbbVie closed Tuesday at $66.76, in a 52-week trading range of $45.45 to $69.82.

The Chemical Castration of Our Children's Brains Wednesday, August 10, 2016 by: Natural News Editors Tags: chemical castration, Children, medications (NaturalNews) In the Vaxxed movie, we have seen how the power establishment not only endangers our children through unproven and dangerous vaccines, the power establishment, as reported to The Common Sense Show by Jon Rappoport, the movie was censored to an extreme degree. (Article by Dave Hodges, republished from Thecommonsenseshow.com) Despite the attempts from the criminal elite to maintain their power over the health and welfare of our children, we are finally, we are getting some concentrated attention on the topic of vaccines and the extreme dangers they pose in the name of increasing the bottom line for medical profits. Yesterday, Mike Adams released an article which cited the fact that 10% of all women in Canada who take the HPV vaccine, end up being treated in an emergency room for side-effects. On the same day as Mike Adams published, I also released a story which released research data going back over 5 years which demonstrated the clear and present danger posed by government should never be allowed to legislate choices which should be reserved for parents with regard to their children's health and welfare. The parents are sovereign over the welfare of their children, not the nanny state. The article focused on the vaccine, Gardasil. In the name of increasing the corporate bottom line, the government watchdog industries of the DEA and FDA, as well as the office of the President, have become the willing lap dogs for Big Pharma and this unholy alliance is serving to endanger our children. It Is Not Just Vaccines, Big Pharma Is Preying Upon Our ChildrenBig Pharma has gone to great lengths to increase sales to the youth of America either through chemically castrating our children's brains or by producing drugs with very serious side effects which serve to seriously degrade both the brain and the body. Our children are being systematically destroyed by the pharmaceutical industry. Children and Psychotropic Drugs Psychotropic drugs affect brain activity associated with mental processes and behavior. While such medication "can have significant benefits for those with mental illnesses, they can also have side effects ranging from mild to serious," including drowsiness, suicidal thoughts, hallucinations, loss of coordination, blurred vision, tremors, weight gain and high cholesterol, according to a report released in 2011 by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO). The report was the result of a five-state study on the rates at which kids both in and out of foster care were prescribed psychotropic drugs through Medicaid in 2008. According to the GAO, foster children in Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, Oregon and Texas were prescribed psychotropic drugs at rates 2.7 to 4.5 times higher than children not in foster care. This gap may be because kids usually enter foster care after being abused or neglected and living through traumatic experiences. However, as a former clinician, I can unequivocally state that all factors can affect mental health and this does not warrant the wholesale medicating of our children. But the GAO report also found that in each of the five states studied, foster kids were more likely to be on five or more psychotropic medications, and many children are placed on doses that exceed U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved levels for their ages thus, increasing the potential for adverse side effects. Some of the medications have not even been approved as safe and effective for children by the FDA. The Ritalin Conspiracy Let's make up a brain disorder, which parallels normal restlessness of children and then transform a dangerous drug, methamphetamine, and get as many kids on the drug as possible. It is good work if you can find it and pharmaceutical companies like Merck and Eli Lilly are leading the way in medical fraud and in the name of record corporate profits The use of Ritalin has become so rampant, that even the DEA has become alarmed by the tremendous increase in the prescribing of these drugs in recent years. Since 1990, prescriptions for methylphenidate have increased by 500%, while prescriptions for amphetamine for the same purpose have increased 400%. The American Pediatric Association claims Ritalin is over prescribed by 600%. For well over a decade, many scientists have speculated that ADD drugs are dangerous and can cause serious injury and death. Etta Brown[5], a licensed educational psychologist and author of Learning Disabilities: Understanding the Problem and Managing the Challenges explained in response to her study that drugs like Ritalin actually destroy the neural function in children's brains. As a result, children who have undergone treatment with Ritalin[5] will actually have a much more difficult time processing information and learning new things. This kind of defeats the purpose of getting children to sit still in school while placed in a zombified state. Brown further reported that Ritalin is responsible for the development of a permanent tic in the face, neck, and head of many of the children who have taken or are taking it. Ironically, Ritalin is responsible for causing far more serious neurological damage than the problems it is alleged to treat. Meta analyses studies over the years have revealed that while drugs like Ritalin visibly place children into a trance like state, these drugs destroy the vulnerable, delicate and developing nervous systems which can and does permanently cripple their ability to function as normal human beings. On his deathbed, the "father" of ADHD, Leon Eisenberg, admitted that the disorder was a fraud that sets up children for life-long risks of drug addiction and failure. ConclusionAny society that would tolerate its power elite abusing children to the degree that we see here, does not deserve to maintain its power of over the people. I have a newsflash for all parents. Big Pharma and their servants in the DEA and FDA do not own your children. When these soulless bastards tie school attendance to vaccine compliance, home school your children. When they outlaw home schooling as they have in Germany, be willing to engage in civil disobedience and go to jail. When they come for your children to inject them with these poisons, it is time to take to the streets. Enough is enough America!

Proof sciencebasedmedicine.org's Doctor David Gorski is a liar - And if you find a bigger Gorski Lie to better this example let us know Wednesday, August 10, 2016 by: Natural News Editors Tags: Dr David Gorski, liar, vaccine propaganda (NaturalNews) It is a serious matter when a medical doctor abuses the trusted status of a licensed medical professional to abuse bully disparage and attack others. It is worse when he uses that status and trusted position to lie about published medical research to make false claims intended to mislead and actively spread deliberate misinformation about medical knowledge whilst doing so to make false claims about others. It is even worse when he does it so publicly and routinely, publishing to mislead people worldwide and on a daily basis on the internet. (Article by ChildHealthSafety, republished from https://childhealthsafety.wordpress.com) Here on CHS we examine just one deliberate intentional lie by Dr Gorski, the circumstances in which he made that lie and look at some implications. The lie we are interested in is published on the website sciencebasedmedicine.org. It is in an attack blog directed against investigative reporter Sharyl Attkisson for her work exposing the scandal of vaccines causing autism in hundreds of thousands of US children. Dr David Gorski engages in his dishonest bullying conduct against a number of other people in the same blog post. But first some background and we also invite readers to post comments here with other examples of Dr Gorski's sciencebasedmedicine.org's lies which they believe they have found to see if they can better our example. Dr Gorski's behavior reveals him as a pseudoscientist and quack. And it indicates Dr Gorski may not be of good moral character – which is what his dishonesty suggests. This kind of behavior also brings all of modern medicine into disrepute and taints all medical doctors. Government health officials are able to avoid answering difficult questions hiding behind bloggers like Gorski who distract attention whilst spreading blatant misinformation and attacking wrongfully the characters and credibility of independently minded people who ask and even sometimes answer the questions health officials prefer to avoid. It of course also tells the world about the website sciencebasedmedicine.org. Dr David Gorski is its Managing Editor. What are the other editors doing about Gorski's deliberate lies and online bullying? Do they condone Dr Gorski's behavior? Have they done anything to stop it? Do they intend putting matters right? Gorski has been doing this kind of thing for many years. The other editors are: Stephen P Novella; Kimball C. Atwood IV, MD; Mark A. Crislip, MD; Harriet Hall, MD; and Paul Ingraham [a former Registered Massage Therapist in Vancouver, Canada]. Are they liars too? We do not know about that because we have not considered any of their work. But if they do nothing then that tells you something about them. Dr David Gorski seems to lie as a matter of routine. Worse still he asserts he relies on science when he is just lying. Gorski of course is not the only liar. On CHS we have highlighted other liars who have been caught lying blatantly, in some instances having to apologize and pay compensation. So what are the implications of Gorski's cyber bullying and lying under the requirements to be met by a licensed medical practitioner in the State of Michigan? [Dr Gorski practices medicine in Michigan]. The Michigan Board of Medicine appears to be responsible for enforcing for the practice of medicine the Public Health Code under Public Act 368 of 1978, as amended. Section 16221 contains a multitude of behaviours but lying appears to fall under a "lack of good moral character". After all, if a licensed medical professional lies about medical knowledge to mislead others and so publicly that does not sound like someone of good moral character, does it? But that is not all. If Dr Gorski advises and treats patients on the basis of the kind of defective untrue and misleading information he published on his blog then he may violate other requirements. Violations include negligence or failure to exercise due care as well as any conduct or practice that impairs, or may impair, the ability to safely and skillfully practice medicine. And it may also indicate a lack of competence to advise and treat patients in accordance with his obligations. Incompetence can be a violation. A mental inability reasonably related to and adversely affecting the licensee's ability to practice in a safe and competent manner can also violate the Code. That raises the question of whether Dr Gorski's psychological profile as revealed by his blogging activities and specifically his inability to be truthful about medical scientific matters makes him psychologically unfit to treat patients. That is not a question for CHS to answer but it would seem an appropriate question to ask. So what did the liar Dr David Gorski do? He published one of his usual rambling articles on the sciencebasedmedicine.org website. It was 3333 words entitled "Anti-vaccine propaganda from Sharyl Attkisson of CBS News" published on April 4, 2011. You can see this was not a trivial matter. Gorski attacked a prominent US journalist along with a number of other people and he lied to do it. Ms Attkisson reported for CBS News on a peer reviewed journal paper published by Dr Helen Ratajczak. Ms Attkisson's report included: "The article in the Journal of Immunotoxicology is entitled "Theoretical aspects of autism: Causes–A review.[1]" The author is Helen Ratajczak, surprisingly herself a former senior scientist at a pharmaceutical firm. Ratajczak did what nobody else apparently has bothered to do: she reviewed the body of published science since autism was first described in 1943. Not just one theory suggested by research such as the role of MMR shots, or the mercury preservative thimerosal; but all of them." Vaccines and autism: a new scientific review[2] By Sharyl Attkisson CBS News April 1, 2011 This is the part of Dr David Gorski's article in which the lie appears and it is a significant lie: And she cites the anti-vaccine blog Child Health Safety[3] as one of her references? The date of the CHS entry cited is June 30, 2010. All I could find was this entry[4], which purports to argue that both Merck's Director of Vaccines and the U.S. government have admitted that vaccines cause autism all based on the long known science showing that a maternal case of rubella while carrying a fetus can result in autism in the child, something that's been known for several decades and is in fact one reason why vaccination against rubella is so important. How on earth did this get through peer review. Obviously, the peer reviewers of Dr. Ratajczak's article were either completely ignorant of the background science (and therefore unqualified) or asleep at the switch." Notice our emphasis added to just three words "all based on". Dr Gorski chose those words to make sure his lie would be all the more convincing. Those three words show how deliberate and calculated Dr Gorski was being in his lying and dishonesty. And just to make sure we are comparing apples with apples, this is the CHS article Dr Gorski lied about Vaccination Causes Autism – Say US Government & Merck's Director of Vaccines[5] as it appeared when Dr Gorski wrote his blog post in April 2011. Notice how in his article Dr Gorski admits he found and read the article. There is no mistake. And of course Dr Gorski was making claims intended to damage the reputations of Ms Attkisson and Dr Ratajczak among others. So it was deliberate, intentional and to cause harm to others. And it was bullying cyber abuse. Now what you can also see here is that Dr Gorski not only lied about the CHS article but he also lied about a number of other things [and this is just looking at the one paragraph] and all for the purposes of attacking Ms Attkisson and Dr Ratajczak. Most people do not click on links in blog posts. But this particular Gorski lie would be one CHS would know to be a lie without needing to refer to the CHS article concerned. But we make sure you can refer to it to so you can see just how dishonest Doctor David Gorski MD is. Contrary to Dr David Gorski's contrived and dishonest claims, the admissions by Merck's Director of Vaccines and U.S. government agencies that vaccines cause autistic conditions were not "all based on" autism caused by rubella infection. They were not based on that at all. And that is perfectly clear from the CHS article. So Gorski despite having found and read the CHS article clearly lied and did so deliberately and intentionally with a remarkable degree of dishonesty. It is also plain for all to see that not only did the CHS article cover several known causes of autism and not just one [as the liar Dr Gorski claimed], but also the quotes admitting vaccines cause autism were in relation to further separate mechanisms by which that can happen. In addition to that the CHS article quoted, cited and linked to original sources including a number of peer reviewed medical journal papers. What is also notable is the causes of autism which Dr Gorski omitted are causes which he steadfastly has avoided referring to. It is difficult for him to deny the admissions made because they were made and the CHS article cited and linked to original sources showing that. That is another aspect of his dishonesty. He ignores completely evidence which goes against the political commercial views he publishes under contract on sciencebasedmedicine.org to support the drug industry and to support government officials in pressurising parents into giving dangerous unnecessary vaccines to their children. But what it does show is that Dr Gorski knows those admitted causes are known real causes of vaccine-caused-autism. If he were to contradict that he would also have to claim Merck's Director of Vaccines and US Government agencies were lying when they made those admissions – admissions which were against their interests [but definitely in the public interest]. So Gorski avoids acknowledging the admissions, but in doing so tacitly confirms he knows they are true. But Gorski did not stop there. He lied also about it being improper of Dr Ratajczak to cite CHS in a peer reviewed journal. But it would have been improper for Dr Ratajczak to take the benefit of the work of others without citing CHS as the source. To do that would have been plagiarism. Dr Ratajczak properly cited the source of the information, which itself cited original sources. So Gorski lied again. And of course Dr Gorski knows that. This also addresses a further lie by Dr Gorski, that the peer review system of the journal concerned was in some way defective by allowing such a citation. Clearly, it was not and could not have been. And that brings us to a final point. That one Gorski paragraph is comprised of 133 words, yet it contains at least 3 lies. So on that basis one might estimate 75 Gorski lies in just that one blog post of 3333 words. And he blogs 6 days a week under contract, so that could be around 450 Gorski lies a week. And over the course of a year it could be 22,500 lies p.a. making Dr Gorski quite an impressive liar by quantity. And if sciencebasedmedicine.org contains that many lies from just one author, how many other lies might there be, if any? You should not hold your breath waiting for the Michigan Board of Medicine to do anything. But what this information does is raise the question: if one doctor can lie that much in one year and so blatantly and publicly and get away with it, how many other doctors and "scientists" are lying too? How many in the US Centers for Disease Control for example?

It is the major cause of pneumonia, blood infections, meningitis, sinusitis, and middle ear infections (otitis media). Pneumococcal infections affect children younger than five years and older people (65 years and older), and it is among the leading infectious disease. It kills almost 1.6 million people (including over 800,000 children under five years) every year. It can be prevented by vaccination and involves the introduction of a dead or weakened antigen into the human body. This produces lymphocytes to counter the infection and any future invasions by that antigen.
