Easter 2017 supermarket opening times AN EGG-STRA SPECIAL TIME After months of excitement, Easter Sunday 2017 is FINALLY here READY, SET, PASSOVER Ever wondered what Passover is all about? Here is the lowdown on today's religious festival DEAR DEIDRE I want more than hot sex with holiday lover after our trip... but am I just her bit on the side? She said: “I have to battle chronic pain daily. I’m in pain 24 hours a day, seven days a week — and I don’t know if I’ll ever get better. “I accepted the assurances that the vaccine is safe and any side effects rare and mild. “I can tell you that this is not true and the side effects are devastating and deadly. “I don’t want to see another child and family suffer like we have had to.” SWNS:South West News Service 9 Chloe was taken to hospital, but there was no other explanation for her condition Chloe received her first jab at All Saints RC Secondary School in Glasgow in January 2015 and the second in February last year. Just three months later, she was out walking with her friends when she broke down in pain, which has continued despite the cocktail of painkillers she has been prescribed. Her mother, Pauline Terry, 50, says she has now had to quit her job as a part-time collection agent to look after her daughter. She said: “Chloe went into the children’s hospital on crutches and came out in a wheelchair. “She went from being a clever, active, bubbly, outgoing wee girl to being unable to do anything for herself.” SWNS:South West News Service 9 Before the jab, Chloe was a happy and healthy teenager Chloe had been cast in main roles in school productions, and had planned to study drama at the city’s prestigious Royal Conservatoire. But her condition has meant that she is unable to attend school or pursue her dreams. Whilst Chloe and her family blame her chronic paralysis on the vaccine, called Gardasil, medical professionals have defended its safety. But mum Pauline believes there is no other possible cause for Chloe’s condition, saying: “There was nothing else that had changed. “When we searched around for her symptoms we found several other girls that had gone through the same thing. “They were all active and healthy before the jab but then after they were in a similar condition to Chloe.” SWNS:South West News Service 9 The controversial HPV vaccine has been associated with other side-effects by parents Following the 2008 campaign to bring HPV vaccines to schools, rates of the cancer-causing virus have plummeted by 90% in Scotland. A Scottish Government spokesman said: “The evidence which has been reviewed, and continues to be reviewed by the bodies from whom the Scottish Government and the other UK administrations take their advice, shows that the HPV vaccine has a good safety profile and is effective.” SWNS:South West News Service 9 Chloe, who dreamed of becoming an actor, has had her life ruined by the chronic condition And a statement from the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHPR) said a recent review found no credible evidence of a link between the HPV vaccine and chronic pain. A spokesperson said: “The HPV vaccine is the most effective way for young girls and women to protect themselves against cervical cancer. “As with all vaccines, the safety of the HPV vaccine is under constant review. Every report of a suspected side effect is taken seriously. “Health authorities around the world, including UK experts, the World Health Organisation, the US Centre for Disease Control and the European Medicines Regulator have recently extensively reviewed the vaccine’s safety and have concluded that there is no credible evidence of a link between the HPV vaccine and a range of chronic illnesses.” SWNS 9 Chloe started feeling symptoms in the months after her HPV jab And a spokeswoman for Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited, manufacturer’s of Gardasil, said: “Patient safety is MSD’s highest priority and we encourage people to self-report or report on behalf of others, any changes to their health which may or may not be medically confirmed. “These reports are taken extremely seriously and are used to monitor long-term safety, however, they do not necessarily prove a causal relationship with the vaccine, but provide MSD and health authorities with information and a line of enquiry for further investigation. “Gardasil is the result of over 10 years of research and development. “The safety of the vaccine has continued to be evaluated in several large post-license surveillance studies in more than one million people. “While no vaccine or medicine is completely without risk, leading international health organisations throughout the world continue to recommend routine HPV vaccination.” The Sun Topics Cancer Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments Comments Most Popular MISSION KIMPOSSIBLE Kim Jong-un’s embarrassing missile launch failure revealed to be caused by US cyber attack as… News what a boob Scarlett Moffatt ‘blasted by Jeremy McConnell’ as she goes topless in her former reality show TV & Showbiz Latest 'I WON'T STOP' Man hunted by cops after shooting 74-year-old grandad in cold blood in horrific Facebook Live broadcast - and… News Revealed Great Sex-pectations Over two thirds of women love this kinky act and wish men would do it more Living Revealed Park life This classic sexual fantasy is becoming increasingly popular among horny Brits Living WHO NEEDS HUMANS?
