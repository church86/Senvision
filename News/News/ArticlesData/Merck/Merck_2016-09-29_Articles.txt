This announcement comes one year after the international coalition, formed by The Carter Center, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), WHO and Merck’s MECTIZAN Donation Program, urged for the final push to eliminate onchocerciasis from the Americas. The government of Guatemala worked in partnership with the MECTIZAN Donation Program, PAHO, WHO and The Carter Center’s Onchocerciasis Elimination Program for the Americas (OEPA), to eliminate onchocerciasis – one of the leading causes of preventable blindness worldwide – using MECTIZAN [®] (ivermectin), donated by Merck. With this verification, four of the six countries in the Americas historically at-risk for river blindness have verified elimination of the disease. “We celebrate this important achievement with the people of Guatemala. River blindness is a debilitating disease that affects individuals and their families, as well as the larger health care system and the economy,” said Kenneth C. Frazier, chairman and chief executive officer of Merck. “Until river blindness is entirely eliminated around the world, we remain committed to working with our partners in the fight against this preventable disease.” For more information, please read the following: PAHO/WHO Announcement The Carter Center Announcement About the MECTIZAN Donation Program In October 1987, Merck announced it would donate the medication MECTIZAN to all who need it for as long as necessary until river blindness is eliminated as a public health problem. The MECTIZAN Donation Program reaches more than 100 million people annually for river blindness. In Latin America, since 1989, more than 11 million treatments of donated MECTIZAN have been delivered by community health workers and non-governmental organizations. Learn more at www.mectizan.org.

More and more, it is a concept that will be part of everyday management. To help cattle producers in that regard, Merck Animal Health has launched a new app, the Meat Sustainability Calculator, which is designed to help producers, suppliers and others in the food chain better understand how the beef production systems and technologies they use impact the environment. The app was created in partnership with Jude Capper, Ph.D., an independent sustainability consultant. Data from peer-reviewed journals was utilized to establish a standard of the environmental impact of North American beef production practices. The app enables users to evaluate their own impact on sustainability by comparing their results to the North American average. Producers and suppliers can compare on a per-head-of-cattle scenario, while food service members or retailers can assess based on amount of beef produced or purchased. Users simply enter the number of cattle they desire to evaluate, or the pounds or kilograms of beef they will be supplying or purchasing. Next, they select various production technologies to determine how they impact sustainability. By comparing individual results to industry benchmarks, individuals can identify opportunities to improve the sustainability of their operations through things such as water usage and land management. “We are excited about this app, as it is unique to the industry – helping those in the beef supply chain realize the impact of their current production methods,” said Jennie Hodgen, Ph.D., Senior Account Manager, Veterinary and Consumer Affairs Team, Merck Animal Health. “Regardless of a person’s role in the chain, the calculator helps assess an operation’s greenhouse gas emissions, as well as water and land usage. Armed with this data, users can be more mindful of their environmental footprint by making a conscious effort to use fewer natural resources to raise healthy animals.”   The app is available for download on tablets and iPads in both the Apple and Android app store.

Here's why. George Budwell (TMFGBudwell) Sep 30, 2016 at 2:45PM Because of an aging global population, an unprecedented amount of innovation, and wider access to medical services in the United States, the healthcare sector should continue to push higher in the coming years. To take advantage of this rising tide, investors may want to grab shares of Allergan (NYSE:AGN), Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) right now. Here's why.  Image source: Getty Images. Allergan's strong top-line growth won't evaporate anytime soon Under the watchful eye of CEO Brent Saunders, Allergan has transformed into one of the fastest-growing pharma companies in the world. Saunders' trick, so to speak, has been to take an extremely aggressive approach to M&A that has helped the company drive revenue growth primarily through increases in sales volume, rather than politically contentious price hikes. Allergan's less traditional growth-by-acquisition strategy has also allowed the company to largely avoid the expensive late-stage clinical failures that tend to plague large-cap pharmas. Keeping with this growth-by-acquisition approach, Allergan recently announced the buyout of both Akarna Therapeutics Ltd. and Tobira Therapeutics, Inc. These deals are part of Allergan's efforts to break into the multibillion-dollar non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, market. Although neither of these acquisitions comes with a built-in revenue-generating NASH product, these deals clearly demonstrate Allergan's aggressive targeting of high-value commercial opportunities. Digging into the details, Allergan just spent roughly $1.75 billion in up-front payments to dive headfirst into NASH, but that amount pales in comparison to the $40 billion market opportunity industry experts believe this particular liver disease will represent by 2025. That's the type of deal-making that can pay huge dividends for shareholders down the road. Bristol has forged a solid footprint in the high-growth immuno-oncology market By 2024, immunotherapies are forecast to make up around a quarter of the entire cancer drug market, making this space one of the fastest-growing segments of the highflying pharmaceutical industry. Bristol-Myers Squibb, perhaps seeing the writing on the wall, was among the first major drugmakers to pivot toward this rapidly growing space when it brought the game-changing PD-1 inhibitor Opdivo to market and subsequently became the undisputed immuno-oncology market share leader. Although Opdivo could face stiffer competition from Merck's (NYSE:MRK) Keytruda following its recent late-stage failure as a monotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer, this drug should still haul in annual sales in excess of $10 billion within a few short years. Bristol's top line is thus expected to sport high single-digit growth over the next several years as a result of Opdivo's breakout success and numerous label expansions, which include classical Hodgkin's lymphoma and advanced bladder cancer, among others. Perhaps the juiciest part of Bristol's growth story, though, is that Opdivo is far from the only immuno-oncology asset in its arsenal. Besides the already approved anti-CTLA4 antibody Yervoy, Bristol's clinical pipeline is chock-full of compelling, high-value immuno-oncology product candidates and possible label expansions for already approved products:   Image source: Bristol-Myers Squibb. All told, Bristol is well positioned to remain a top player in the immuno-oncology market going forward, even as other big pharmas like Merck vigorously attempt to cut into Bristol's outsized piece of the pie.  Pfizer's modest growth and top-notch dividend shouldn't be ignored Despite some serious setbacks on the M&A front, Pfizer has slowly returned to growth, fueled mainly by the growing sales of the breast cancer treatment Ibrance, the blood thinner Eliquis, and the pneumococcal pneumonia vaccine Prevnar 13. And after its recent acquisition of Medivation for its blockbuster prostate cancer drug Xtandi, Pfizer now sports two of the world's best-selling oncology products. The drugmaker is also hoping to add a third major piece to its oncology franchise with the experimental immunotherapy avelumab, which is in clinical development as a possible treatment for a variety of malignancies, including lung, kidney, and stomach cancer.  Topping it off, Pfizer sports one of the richest dividends among major drugmakers, with a current yield of 3.5%. And now that a split of the company is off the table for the time being, this enticing dividend should be sustainable for the long-haul, given Pfizer's strong cash position and enormous free cash flows of nearly $15 billion over the last 12 months.    Long story short, Pfizer offers solid, though modest, growth prospects and a top-notch dividend, making it a compelling healthcare stock to own right now.  George Budwell owns shares of Allergan and Pfizer.

The first patient has been recruited in the VICTORIA trial of vericiguat, an oral soluble guanylate-cyclase (sGC) stimulator thought to work by correcting a dysfunctional nitric oxide signalling pathway seen in heart failure. The large (and likely expensive) trial will enrol a total of around 4,900 patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and compare vericiguat to placebo on top of standard treatment. It is due to generate results in 2020. The primary efficacy measure in the trial is the time to first occurrence of the composite endpoint of cardiovascular mortality or hospitalisation for heart failure. The decision to press ahead with vericiguat comes even though the drug produced a less-than-stellar performance in the phase II SOCRATES-REDUCED trial. Given at a range of doses, the drug failed to achieve its primary objective of achieving a significant reduction in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) a biomarker in patients with worsening HFrEF, although a subgroup given the highest dose (10mg) did show a benefit compared to placebo. According to the investigators in the trial, in HFrEF patients on 10mg vericiguat showed some improvements in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) as well as fewer clinical events than the placebo group. A second phase II trial of vericiguat in heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) - an even more hard-to-treat form of the disease - has yet to be announced even though the trial was completed last year. It is rumoured to have been discontinued in this indication. Bayer - which holds all rights to the drug outside the US - has previously said it expects vericiguat to bring in approximately €500m ($558m) in peak annual sales. Analysts at Credit Suisse have predicted 2020 sales of around $58m, with a 40% chance the drug will reach the market. Another new drug for HFrEF, Novartis' Entresto (sacubitril and valsartan) - has been predicted to become a $5bn product but is off to a slow start with sales of just $49m in the first half of the year. It is estimated that 1-2% of all adults in industrialised countries are affected by HF at the moment - and the incidence is predicted to rise sharply by 2030. It remains an invariably fatal condition however, with only half of patients still alive five years after diagnosis. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments.

Here's why. George Budwell (TMFGBudwell) Sep 30, 2016 at 2:45PM Because of an aging global population, an unprecedented amount of innovation, and wider access to medical services in the United States, the healthcare sector should continue to push higher in the coming years. To take advantage of this rising tide, investors may want to grab shares of Allergan (NYSE:AGN), Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) right now. Here's why.  Image source: Getty Images. Allergan's strong top-line growth won't evaporate anytime soon Under the watchful eye of CEO Brent Saunders, Allergan has transformed into one of the fastest-growing pharma companies in the world. Saunders' trick, so to speak, has been to take an extremely aggressive approach to M&A that has helped the company drive revenue growth primarily through increases in sales volume, rather than politically contentious price hikes. Allergan's less traditional growth-by-acquisition strategy has also allowed the company to largely avoid the expensive late-stage clinical failures that tend to plague large-cap pharmas. Keeping with this growth-by-acquisition approach, Allergan recently announced the buyout of both Akarna Therapeutics Ltd. and Tobira Therapeutics, Inc. These deals are part of Allergan's efforts to break into the multibillion-dollar non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, market. Although neither of these acquisitions comes with a built-in revenue-generating NASH product, these deals clearly demonstrate Allergan's aggressive targeting of high-value commercial opportunities. Digging into the details, Allergan just spent roughly $1.75 billion in up-front payments to dive headfirst into NASH, but that amount pales in comparison to the $40 billion market opportunity industry experts believe this particular liver disease will represent by 2025. That's the type of deal-making that can pay huge dividends for shareholders down the road. Bristol has forged a solid footprint in the high-growth immuno-oncology market By 2024, immunotherapies are forecast to make up around a quarter of the entire cancer drug market, making this space one of the fastest-growing segments of the highflying pharmaceutical industry. Bristol-Myers Squibb, perhaps seeing the writing on the wall, was among the first major drugmakers to pivot toward this rapidly growing space when it brought the game-changing PD-1 inhibitor Opdivo to market and subsequently became the undisputed immuno-oncology market share leader. Although Opdivo could face stiffer competition from Merck's (NYSE:MRK) Keytruda following its recent late-stage failure as a monotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer, this drug should still haul in annual sales in excess of $10 billion within a few short years. Bristol's top line is thus expected to sport high single-digit growth over the next several years as a result of Opdivo's breakout success and numerous label expansions, which include classical Hodgkin's lymphoma and advanced bladder cancer, among others. Perhaps the juiciest part of Bristol's growth story, though, is that Opdivo is far from the only immuno-oncology asset in its arsenal. Besides the already approved anti-CTLA4 antibody Yervoy, Bristol's clinical pipeline is chock-full of compelling, high-value immuno-oncology product candidates and possible label expansions for already approved products:   Image source: Bristol-Myers Squibb. All told, Bristol is well positioned to remain a top player in the immuno-oncology market going forward, even as other big pharmas like Merck vigorously attempt to cut into Bristol's outsized piece of the pie.  Pfizer's modest growth and top-notch dividend shouldn't be ignored Despite some serious setbacks on the M&A front, Pfizer has slowly returned to growth, fueled mainly by the growing sales of the breast cancer treatment Ibrance, the blood thinner Eliquis, and the pneumococcal pneumonia vaccine Prevnar 13. And after its recent acquisition of Medivation for its blockbuster prostate cancer drug Xtandi, Pfizer now sports two of the world's best-selling oncology products. The drugmaker is also hoping to add a third major piece to its oncology franchise with the experimental immunotherapy avelumab, which is in clinical development as a possible treatment for a variety of malignancies, including lung, kidney, and stomach cancer.  Topping it off, Pfizer sports one of the richest dividends among major drugmakers, with a current yield of 3.5%. And now that a split of the company is off the table for the time being, this enticing dividend should be sustainable for the long-haul, given Pfizer's strong cash position and enormous free cash flows of nearly $15 billion over the last 12 months.    Long story short, Pfizer offers solid, though modest, growth prospects and a top-notch dividend, making it a compelling healthcare stock to own right now.  George Budwell owns shares of Allergan and Pfizer.

X Ireland’s only living Nobel scientist honoured at Trinity College Honours for worm expert William C Campbell at university where he studied in 1950s Fri, Sep 30, 2016, 14:47 Updated: Fri, Sep 30, 2016, 14:53 Ciarán D'Arcy Video Images Ireland’s only living Nobel laureate scientist, celebrated parasitologist William C Campbell, enjoyed a poignant homecoming at Trinity College on Friday - the university where he studied as an undergraduate in the 1950s. Video: TCD Celebrated parasitologist William C Campbell has enjoyed a poignant homecoming at his alma mater, Trinity College Dublin. File photograph: CJ Gunther/EPA         Ireland’s only living Nobel laureate scientist, William C Campbell, enjoyed a poignant homecoming at Trinity College on Friday - the university where he studied as an undergraduate in the 1950s. The celebrated parasitologist was honoured by the Nobel Committee which last year awarded the prize for medicine to him and fellow scientist Satoshi Omura for their work in defeating the roundworm, which causes river blindness. That disease - which still affects some 25 million people, mostly in developing countries - is now in decline. At a ceremony at Trinity College, Provost Patrick Prendergast announced the establishment of the William C Campbell lectureship in parasite biology. Joy expressed In a brief but emotional oration, the Donegal man, who was surrounded by friends, family and colleagues of old, expressed his joy at being invited back to the institution he has such a strong connection to. “One of the first letters I sent home when I crossed the seas said that there’s no other university I would rather have been to. I’d rather have gone to here than any other university,” he said, tearfully. Irish man’s Nobel win highlights the glacial nature of science Irish-born William C Campbell awarded the Nobel prize Campbell ‘delighted’ as he receives Nobel prize in Stockholm Campbell’s critical discovery of worm-killing avermectin was made while working as a researcher with pharmaceutical giant Merck in New Jersey after earning a PhD from the University of Wisconsin, but he reserved special praise for his Trinity mentor, Desmond Smyth. “I’ve had the great good fortune to come under the influence of Desmond Smyth, who was a special person, and who fostered my interest in parasitic worms, and I have been attached to parasitic worms ever since,” he said, mixing humour with poignancy. “I feel so strongly about them, I write poems about them, I paint pictures of them. Worms ‘are brilliant’ “I just think they are wonderful, they’re brilliant, they have incredible diversity - and in fact I have no problem reconciling the fact that I love worms but have spent half my life trying to kill them,” he quipped. ADVERTISEMENT Mr Prendergast told the audience “Bill” Campbell’s story had a broader resonance, especially considering the decision to make the patented ivermectin drug, a derivative of avermectin, free to those who need it. “It speaks of the importance of donating drugs where they’re needed. It speaks of the importance of respecting basic research,” he said. Trinity College professor of zoology Celia Holland added: “Bill’s achievement has been fundamentally important to that whole issue of these diseases which were forgotten. “They were the diseases of forgotten people, they were diseases of the disadvantaged - and now they’re coming into the light.” Adaptable, cunning, resourceful She concluded by quoting renowned US scientist John Janovy jnr in saying parasitologists are like coyotes: adaptable, cunning and resourceful. “In the most respectful sense, I salute the greatest coyote,” she said in the direction of Prof Campbell, amid rapturous applause.       Topics: Celia Holland Ciaran D Arcy Ireland Desmond Smyth John Janovy Patrick Prendergast Prof Campbell Satoshi Omura Trinity Provost Nobel Committee Trinity College University Of Wisconsin Merck Donegal New Jersey Read More Nobel prize comes dropping slow for William Campbell William C Campbell warns of decline in scientific research Prize parasites: how an Irish man won the Nobel More from The Irish Times Health ‘Serious concern’ about work of Galway surgeon Opinion Una Mullally: I never liked Facebook, but now I am actually worried about it English Soccer Liberation!

Politicians love to pick on pharmaceutical companies, and they can be an easy target during campaign season. At the end of the day, they will survive and continue to grow and, best of all, pay dependable dividends. A new report from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey has an end-of-the-quarter sector update on large cap pharmaceuticals. Five companies are mentioned in the report, and three of them are rated Buy. We highlight the three stocks that are favorites at SunTrust. AbbVie This is one of the top global pharmaceutical stocks picks across Wall Street. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV) is a global, research-based biopharmaceutical company formed in 2013 following separation from Abbott Laboratories. The company’s mission is to use its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world’s most complex and serious diseases. AbbVie employs more than 26,000 people worldwide and markets medicines in more than 170 countries. One of the biggest concerns with AbbVie is what eventually might happen with anti-inflammatory therapy Humira, which generated $14 billion in sales in fiscal 2015. That was the most any drug has recorded during a single year and represents a gigantic part of the company’s overall earnings. The problem is that biosimilars and generics are itching to enter the market with Amgen leading the charge, and some Wall Street analysts project that AbbVie may have a difficult time stopping that trend. Back in May, the patent board instituted Coherus BioSciences’ Inter Partes Review against the Humira ‘135 patent. The outcome of the review is expected in 12 months. While most analysts remain positive on Humira duration, the expected litigation uncertainty could continue to create an overhang on the stock, which does give investors chances to pick up shares lower. The SunTrust team notes that the stock trades at a small discount to its large pharmaceutical peers, and they cite the biosimilar issue as a likely reason why. They also think some on Wall Street are still less than thrilled over the steep price the company paid to buy Pharmacyclics. AbbVie investors receive a 3.63% dividend. The SunTrust price target for the stock is $85, and the Wall Street consensus target is $71.28 Shares closed Thursday at $62.88. Eli Lilly This is another company with substantial upside potential. Eli Lilly and Co. (NYSE: LLY) is a global health care company with numerous core products in a number of primary-care pharmaceutical markets. The company generates revenues from its pharmaceutical product and animal health segments. The product portfolio includes Zyprexa (for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder), Gemzar (pancreatic cancer), Evista (osteoporosis), Cymbalta (depression), Cialis (erectile dysfunction), Strattera (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), Erbitux (cancer) and Alimta (chemotherapy). Eli Lilly also has a strong presence in the diabetes market.

In all, the epidemic spread to nine countries resulting in more than 27,000 confirmed cases and 11,000 deaths. The deadly virus not only continues to pose a threat to West African citizens, but to medical staff and warfighters deployed to the region. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency’s Joint Science and Technology Office led basic research for the first Ebola vaccine, which was granted emergency use authorization and deployed within the affected area. Recently, DTRA’s JSTO-funded Merck Ebola Vaccine, designated V920, moved closer to becoming a licensed vaccine available to protect the warfighters. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the vaccine breakthrough therapy designation, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) provided the vaccine PRIME (PRIority MEdicines) status. The FDA’s breakthrough therapy designation accelerates development and review of a drug candidate planned for use, alone or in combination, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Similarly, PRIME is an approach from the EMA to enhance support for the development of medicines that target an unmet medical need. PRIME is intended to optimize development plans and speed up evaluation so these medicines can reach patients quicker. This special status focuses on medicines that may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments or benefit patients without any other treatment options. To be accepted for PRIME, a medicine has to show its potential to benefit patients with unmet medical needs based on early clinical data. V920 was engineered by scientists from the Public Health Agency of Canada and subsequently licensed to a subsidiary of NewLink Genetics Corporation. DTRA funded NewLink Genetics to develop the vaccine, including funding critical animal efficacy studies, vaccine production and a human safety study at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. Merck then licensed V920 from NewLink Genetics to accelerate the development, licensure and availability of the vaccine. Since that time, the vaccine began a clinical development program with funding from the U.S. Government, including DTRA and the Biomedical Advanced Research Development Authority among others. Although research evaluating V920 is ongoing, data from a 2015 study conducted in Guinea by the World Health Organization, the Health Ministry of Guinea, Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders), Epicentre and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health reported 100 percent efficacy (95 percent confidence interval: 74.7 - 100 percent efficacy; p=0.0036) following vaccination with a single dose in vaccinated individuals. The study also reported that all vaccinated individuals appeared to be protected against the Ebola virus infection within six to 10 days of vaccination. The FDA breakthrough therapy designation and the EMA PRIME status will streamline the licensing of the world’s first vaccine for Ebola. The DTRA-funded V920 vaccine will then be available to protect warfighters and our allies from future Ebola endemics whether natural or weaponized.

KEEPING SCORE: Japan’s Nikkei 225 slumped 1.6 percent to 16,435.61 and South Korea’s Kospi fell 0.9 percent to 2,051.10. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index retreated 1.3 percent to 23,440.84. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 dropped 0.8 percent to 5,425.80. China’s Shanghai Composite Index was up 0.1 percent to 3,000.58. Stocks in Singapore and other Southeast Asian countries were also lower. ANALYST’S TAKE: “Risk sentiment waned overnight as worries about global banks weighed on markets,” said Alex Wijaya, senior sales trader at CMC Markets in Singapore. “Stock markets worldwide are rattled by the latest development at Deutsche Bank.” BANK WOES: U.S. authorities are seeking $14 billion from Deutsche Bank to settle legal claims over its sales of mortgage securities in 2007 and 2008, which helped kick off a global financial crisis. The bank said it had struck a deal to sell a subsidiary and stressed that it was not seeking government help but investors are worried what will happen to Germany’s biggest lender and to the broader financial system if Deutsche Bank runs low on capital. Analysts said the troubles at Deutsche Bank are raising scrutiny over other banks in Europe, which are also in talks regarding mortgage settlement with the U.S. authorities. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks finished lower on Thursday as drug companies and banks absorbed large losses. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 195.79 points, or 1.1 percent, to 18,143.45. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index sank 20.24 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,151.13. The Nasdaq composite dropped 49.39 points, or 0.9 percent, to 5,269.15. OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude lost 20 cents to $47.62 per barrel in New York. The contract gained 78 cents, or 1.7 percent, to close at $47.83 a barrel on Thursday. Oil prices surged earlier this week after the nations of OPEC, which collectively produce more than third of the world’s oil, agreed to a small cut in production in a surprise decision Brent crude, the international benchmark, fell 36 cents to $49.45 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 101.37 yen from 101.16 yen while the euro fell to $1.121 from $1.122.

Posted 29 Sep 2016 22:15 Updated 30 Sep 2016 04:40 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., September 28, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Wall Street dropped on Thursday, weighed down by Apple as well as selling in Wells Fargo, Citigroup and other major banks as investors worried about the health of Deutsche Bank. The S&P 500 financial index declined 1.49 percent after Bloomberg reported that some hedge funds have withdrawn excess cash and positions held at the German lender. Growing concerns over the stability of Germany's biggest bank have pushed its shares to record lows and its U.S.-listed stock on Thursday tumbled 6.7 percent. "This Deutsche Bank story is really casting a very long shadow over equity markets," said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group, in New York. "In some respects, it speaks to fears over large money-center banks having serious problems, and the last time we had that conversation was the financial crisis." Adding to negative sentiment in the banking sector, Wells Fargo & Co lost 2.07 percent after U.S. lawmakers rebuked CEO John Stumpf over his handling of sales abuses. Citigroup dropped 2.28 percent and JPMorgan Chase fell 1.59 percent. Apple fell 1.55 percent after Barclays cut its price target. The stock was the biggest drag on Wall Street. The S&P healthcare index lost 1.84 percent and also weighed heavily on the S&P 500 as shares of Merck and Johnson & Johnson declined. Among the gainers, Qualcomm jumped 6.3 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported the chipmaker is in talks to buy NXP Semiconductors. NXP surged 16.88 percent. Up 5 percent this year, the S&P 500 is trading near 16 times expected earnings, above its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. "Equity valuations are stretched and priced for perfection," said Mike Baele, managing director with the private client reserve group at U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. "I would not be surprised to see additional volatility." The CBOE Volatility Index, a gauge of near-term investor anxiety, jumped 14 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 1.07 percent to 18,143.45 points at the close, its sharpest decline since Sept 13. The S&P 500 lost 0.93 percent to end at 2,151.13 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.93 percent to 5,269.15. The S&P utilities index, which is sensitive to interest rates, fell 1.45 percent, its fifth day of losses in a row. Oil prices were up a day after OPEC members agreed to curb production, even as analysts raised questions about the effectiveness of the deal. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.87-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.09-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 35 new lows. About 7.7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the 7.0 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Drugmakers faced scrutiny over price increases, while banks fell as investors worried about the stability of Deutsche Bank and other financial institutions. Stocks were slightly lower in morning trading, and they fell hard at 12:30 p.m. Eastern time on renewed concerns about Germany's largest bank. EpiPen maker Mylan fell after legislators called for an investigation of the company. The price of oil continued to rise, which sent oil drilling and equipment companies higher. Stocks gave up most of their gains from the last two days. Quincy Krosby, market strategist for Prudential Financial, said investors don't trust Deutsche Bank's statements about its financial health and they are worried what will happen to the bank and to the broader financial system if Deutsche Bank runs low on capital. "The market begins to worry about Deutsche Bank and then the relationships Deutsche Bank has with other banks here in the United States," she said. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 195.79 points, or 1.1 percent, to 18,143.45. The Standard & Poor's 500 index sank 20.24 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,151.13. The Nasdaq composite dropped 49.39 points, or 0.9 percent, to 5,269.15. Mylan slumped after a group of senators asked the Department of Justice to investigate whether the drugmaker broke the law when it classified its emergency allergy shot EpiPen as a generic drug, which allowed Mylan to make lower rebate payments to states. Mylan gave up $1.75, or 4.4 percent, to $38.47. The stock is down 21 percent since mid-August as the company has come under criticism for repeatedly raising EpiPen's price over the last decade. Other drug companies traded lower as investors worry that the government will take action to rein in drug price increases. Merck fell $1.39, or 2.2 percent, to $61.91. Amgen fell $4.26, or 2.5 percent, to $165.45. Financial stocks slumped on renewed worries about Deutsche Bank. U.S. regulators are seeking $14 billion to settle legal claims over its sales of mortgage securities. It's also unclear whether the German government would support the bank if it runs low on capital. Deutsche Bank has said it isn't seeking government aid. Deutsche Bank's U.S.-listed shares have lost more than half their value this year. On Thursday they tumbled 82 cents, or 6.7 percent, to $11.48 in heavy trading. JPMorgan Chase slid $1.06, or 1.6 percent, to $65.65 and Goldman Sachs shed $4.50, or 2.8 percent, to $158.95. Oil prices continued to rise after a 5 percent surge the day before. Energy prices had jumped after the nations of OPEC, which collectively produce more than third of the world's oil, agreed to a small cut in production. The decision was a surprise, but something investors had long hoped for. The deal won't be finalized until November. U.S. crude picked up 78 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $47.83 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international benchmark, added 55 cents, or 1 percent, to $49.24 a barrel in London. Companies that drill for oil rose sharply as investors expected them to benefit from higher prices for crude. Devon Energy added $1.46, or 3.5 percent, to $43.04. Companies that provide rigs and other equipment to drillers also rose as investors expected that higher prices for crude will encourage more drilling. Helmerich & Payne rose $2.48, or 4 percent, to $65.26. Companies that refine oil fell on the prospect they will have to pay more money for the oil they refine. Marathon Petroleum fell $2.90, or 6.8 percent, to $39.74 and Valero Energy lost $3.40, or 6.2 percent, to $51.71. Who's hired?

The company has sold several brands to focus on product lines like Chef Boyardee and Hebrew National, and it's getting ready to split into two companies. ConAgra rose $3.12, or 7.2 percent, to $46.25. CBS and Viacom rose after Sumner Redstone's National Amusements, which controls both companies, said it wants them to combine again. CBS and Viacom had merged in 1999 and split up in 2006. Viacom, which recently replaced its CEO and then announced its interim CEO will leave in November, rose $1.21, or 3.3 percent, to $37.77 and CBS rose 42 cents to $54.57. Chipmakers Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors surged after the Wall Street Journal reported that Qualcomm is in talks to buy NXP. It said Qualcomm is considering other deals, but a purchase of NXP could be worth more than $30 billion. Bond prices moved higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.56 percent from 1.57 percent. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline fell 1 cent to $1.47 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2 cents to $1.51 a gallon. Natural gas shed 4 cents to $2.96 per 1,000 cubic feet. Germany's DAX lost 0.3 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 climbed 1 percent and the CAC 40 in France rose 0.3 percent.

ANALYST'S TAKE: "Risk sentiment waned overnight as worries about global banks weighed on markets," said Alex Wijaya, senior sales trader at CMC Markets in Singapore. "Stock markets worldwide are rattled by the latest development at Deutsche Bank." BANK WOES: U.S. authorities are seeking $14 billion from Deutsche Bank to settle legal claims over its sales of mortgage securities in 2007 and 2008, which helped kick off a global financial crisis. The bank said it had struck a deal to sell a subsidiary and stressed that it was not seeking government help but investors are worried what will happen to Germany's biggest lender and to the broader financial system if Deutsche Bank runs low on capital. Analysts said the troubles at Deutsche Bank are raising scrutiny over other banks in Europe, which are also in talks regarding mortgage settlement with the U.S. authorities. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks finished lower on Thursday as drug companies and banks absorbed large losses. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 195.79 points, or 1.1 percent, to 18,143.45. The Standard & Poor's 500 index sank 20.24 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,151.13. The Nasdaq composite dropped 49.39 points, or 0.9 percent, to 5,269.15. OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude lost 20 cents to $47.62 per barrel in New York. The contract gained 78 cents, or 1.7 percent, to close at $47.83 a barrel on Thursday. Oil prices surged earlier this week after the nations of OPEC, which collectively produce more than third of the world's oil, agreed to a small cut in production in a surprise decision Brent crude, the international benchmark, fell 36 cents to $49.45 a barrel in London.

Posted 29 Sep 2016 22:15 Updated 30 Sep 2016 04:40 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., September 28, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Wall Street dropped on Thursday, weighed down by Apple as well as selling in Wells Fargo, Citigroup and other major banks as investors worried about the health of Deutsche Bank. The S&P 500 financial index declined 1.49 percent after Bloomberg reported that some hedge funds have withdrawn excess cash and positions held at the German lender. Growing concerns over the stability of Germany's biggest bank have pushed its shares to record lows and its U.S.-listed stock on Thursday tumbled 6.7 percent. "This Deutsche Bank story is really casting a very long shadow over equity markets," said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group, in New York. "In some respects, it speaks to fears over large money-center banks having serious problems, and the last time we had that conversation was the financial crisis." Adding to negative sentiment in the banking sector, Wells Fargo & Co lost 2.07 percent after U.S. lawmakers rebuked CEO John Stumpf over his handling of sales abuses. Citigroup dropped 2.28 percent and JPMorgan Chase fell 1.59 percent. Apple fell 1.55 percent after Barclays cut its price target. The stock was the biggest drag on Wall Street. The S&P healthcare index lost 1.84 percent and also weighed heavily on the S&P 500 as shares of Merck and Johnson & Johnson declined. Among the gainers, Qualcomm jumped 6.3 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported the chipmaker is in talks to buy NXP Semiconductors. NXP surged 16.88 percent. Up 5 percent this year, the S&P 500 is trading near 16 times expected earnings, above its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. "Equity valuations are stretched and priced for perfection," said Mike Baele, managing director with the private client reserve group at U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. "I would not be surprised to see additional volatility." The CBOE Volatility Index, a gauge of near-term investor anxiety, jumped 14 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 1.07 percent to 18,143.45 points at the close, its sharpest decline since Sept 13. The S&P 500 lost 0.93 percent to end at 2,151.13 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.93 percent to 5,269.15. The S&P utilities index, which is sensitive to interest rates, fell 1.45 percent, its fifth day of losses in a row. Oil prices were up a day after OPEC members agreed to curb production, even as analysts raised questions about the effectiveness of the deal. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.87-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.09-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 35 new lows. About 7.7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the 7.0 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

The S&P healthcare index fell 0.7 percent, marking the second straight day of decline as shares of Merck and Johnson & Johnson booked losses. Apple fell 1.23 percent after Barclays cut its price target. The stock was the biggest drag on Wall Street. Investors are awaiting Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's speech in Washington for clues on the timing of the next interest rate hike. "The markets are taking a step back after a couple of pretty good days," said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. "It is the end of the quarter so there are people messing around with some positions." The three indexes have registered gains in the past two days. At 11:01 a.m. ET (1501 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 40.85 points, or 0.22 percent, at 18,298.39. The S&P 500 was down 4.78 points, or 0.22 percent, at 2,166.59. The Nasdaq Composite was down 22.79 points, or 0.43 percent, at 5,295.75. Five of the 11 major S&P indexes were lower, with utilities falling the most by 1.1 percent. The sector, which is sensitive to interest rates, is on track to mark its fifth day of losses in a row. Kansas City Fed President and voting member Esther George told CNBC that it was time to move ahead with a rate hike, a stand that Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart echoed. Oil prices were up 0.4 percent, after Wednesday's 6 percent rally, as investors questioned whether an OPEC agreement to curb production would be enough to rebalance a heavily over-supplied market. ConAgra was the top percentage gainer on the S&P, rising 7.3 percent after the company's profit beat analysts' estimate. Intra-Cellular plunged 63.2 percent after the company said its schizophrenia drug did not show any clinically significant difference when compared with placebo. Ebay rose 3 percent after Deutsche Bank upgraded the e-commerce platform's rating to "buy" and raised its price target. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,667 to 1,156. On the Nasdaq, 1,625 issues fell and 995 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed 19 new 52-week highs and one new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 52 new highs and 20 new lows.

The company will partner with Nektar Therapeutics on a combined clinical trial. Opdivo will be combined with Nektar’s experimental immune-stimulatory therapy to “improve on the current standard-of-care to treat melanoma and cancers of the kidney, colorectal system, bladder and the most common form of lung cancer,” reported Reuters. BMS’s drug is already approved for advanced melanoma and lung cancer, but it faces formidable competition from Merck’s Keytruda. A study published in August drew distinct parallels between both candidates’ prospects as the development process continued. Last month, BMS announced Opdivo didn’t meet its primary endpoint in a Phase 3 trial targeting first-line advanced non-small cell lung cancer, reported FierceBiotech. By contrast, Merck reported positive data regarding that indication for Keytruda in June. Here’s how this partnership with Nektar will work. Both companies will split the costs of the clinical trials evenly with oversight provided by a joint steering committee, according to another FierceBiotech report. Nektar will manage the trial while BMS has the right of first refusal if they decide to not proceed with commercialization. Each firm would also need to implement a new deal to advance Phase 3 development. The first part of this agreement will be a dose-escalation trial using Nektar’s candidate, which is expected to be completed during the first half of 2017.

Diane Harper, M.D., professor and chair of the department of Family and Geriatric Medicine at the University of Louisville, revealed at the 4th International Conference on Vaccination that HPV vaccines are essentially worthless, because rates of cervical cancer in the U.S. are extremely low anyway. Her speech was intended to promote the benefits of vaccines, but she changed her mind and went in a different direction in an effort to "clean her conscience about the deadly vaccines," according to The Daily Sheeple. Dr. Harper, a former vaccine research scientist for Merck, said she wouldn't be able to sleep at night unless she aired the truth about HPV vaccines. In her speech, given in Reston, Virginia, she said that 70 percent of all HPV infections resolve themselves without treatment, and 90 percent do so within two years. Over 40 young girls reported to have died from HPV vaccinesAll safety trials for HPV vaccines were done on 15-year-olds, said Dr. Harper, and not 9-year-olds, the demographic for which the immunizations are now recommended. Furthermore, there is a real risk associated with these vaccines, she added. More than 15,000 girls have experienced adverse side effects from Gardasil, according to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). A number likely to be far higher in reality, since many vaccine side effects go unreported. At least 44 girls are known to have died from these vaccines. Some side effects experienced by those receiving the HPV vaccines include seizures, blood clots, brain inflammation, lupus and Guillain Barre Syndrome, a rare but serious autoimmune deficiency that causes the immune system to attack and damage nerve cells. While the majority of those with GBS recover, the disorder may cause muscle weakness, difficulty breathing, paralysis and sometimes death. As with most vaccines, parents are usually not made aware of the risks. HPV vaccines work on only four of the 40 strains of the venereal disease "About eight in every ten women who have been sexually active will have HPV at some stage of their life," said Dr. Harper during her speech. "Normally there are no symptoms, and in 98 per cent of cases it clears itself. But in those cases where it doesn't, and isn't treated, it can lead to pre-cancerous cells which may develop into cervical cancer." Dr. Harper said that while Gardasil and Cervarix are marketed as protecting against cervical cancer, the claim has not been proven and is hypothetical. Research conducted on the drugs show "there is no demonstrated relationship between the condition being vaccinated for and the rare cancers that the vaccine might prevent, but it is marketed to do that nonetheless," she said. Former Merck scientist attacked for speaking out about HPV vaccine dangers "In fact, there is no actual evidence that the vaccine can prevent any cancer. From the manufacturers own admissions, the vaccine only works on 4 strains out of 40 for a specific venereal disease that dies on its own in a relatively short period, so the chance of it actually helping an individual is about the same as the chance of her being struck by a meteorite." Her comments though brave, placed Dr. Harper's reputation at risk. Big Pharma's attack dogs quickly sought to destroy her, attempting to dismantle her credibility as a professional research scientist. Since coming forward with her concerns about the HPV vaccines, a relentless and vicious campaign has been waged against her. The former Merck scientist was made to look like a kook in an article published by The Sunday Express, a British tabloid, which heavily misquoted her. Hoping to set the record straight, Dr. Harper clarified her position in an interview with CBS News, during which she said that HPV vaccines carry real risks while offering very little benefits. "The benefit to public health is nothing, there is no reduction in cervical cancers, they are just postponed, unless the protection lasts for at least 15 years, and over 70% of all sexually active females of all ages are vaccinated." She also added that reported side effects of the vaccine prove HPV vaccines are more dangerous than the cervical cancer its makers say it prevents.

Jason Payne / PNG Share Adjust Comment Print Vancouver’s Zymeworks has signed a licensing agreement with Japanese pharmaceutical giant Daiichi Sankyo to develop innovative cancer drugs. Daiichi Sankyo will gain access to Zymeworks’ drug development platforms in exchange for an undisclosed up-front payment and research support. The company will also be eligible to receive payments as drugs resulting from the research reach clinical and commercial milestones, as well as royalties on global product sales. Daiichi Sankyo is the second largest pharmaceutical company in Japan. Zymeworks has also inked recent deals with GlaxoSmith-Kline, Merck, Eli Lilly and Celgene.  Zymeworks‘ “bi-specific” antibodies can be fitted with proteins that recognize two markers on the same cell, reducing the chances that healthy cells will be destroyed, according to Ali Tehrani, Zymeworks’ president and CEO. Targeting two drivers of disease with a single … antibody is a key scientific advance Biologic therapies — drugs that activate the body’s immune system — are a huge leap forward from conventional chemotherapy treatments that kill cancer cells and healthy cells indiscriminately. Such antibodies can also be designed to identify and destroy two or more different kinds of cells, which gives the potential to treat so-called “mosaic tumours” that are made up of several different kinds of cancer cells, each with its own unique vulnerabilities. “Targeting two drivers of disease with a single monoclonal antibody is a key scientific advance that may help change the standard of care for patients with cancer,” said Antoine Yver, vice-president of oncology research and development for Daiichi Sankyo. Mosaic cancers are very challenging to treat, because conventional drugs that target one kind of cancer cell may leave others intact even in the same tumour. The ability to target two or more cell types at a time is expected to improve the efficacy of cancer medications. In addition, Zymeworks will license immuno-oncology antibodies from Daiichi Sankyo, with the right to research, develop and commercialize multiple bi-specific products globally. “The in-licensing component of the transaction will enable Zymeworks to expand its therapeutic pipeline in the near term by accelerating a number of our immuno-oncology programs into the clinic and to ultimately provide more effective and targeted treatments to patients,” said Tehrani. rshore@postmedia.com Auld Phillips: Fashion retailer thrives in small communities Investment Industry Association of Canada's Vancouver members hit by low commodity...

Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk announced Thursday that it is cutting 1,000 jobs (about half of them in Denmark), after last month slashing growth forecasts for 2016, citing lower U.S. prices for diabetes drugs. These will likely not be the last victims, either—Novo and competitors such as Sanofi and Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly will likely have to keep tightening their belts as prices and profit margins fall. Diabetes is fertile ground for a drug-price fight. It's a $40 billion-plus market in the United States, with many big firms looking to protect billion-dollar franchises. Each of the many medicines treating diabetes has multiple strong competitors. And all the customers want to pay less. Diabetes is a chronic illness affecting millions of people—a recipe for a lot of drug spending. Naturally, those who pay the drug bills—insurers, pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, and the U.S. government—have an interest in keeping prices under control. And those payers have extra leverage against the pharma companies because of the sheer number of drugs on the market. In August, pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts said it would decline next year to pay for several Novo Nordisk drugs—which accounted for more than $7 billion in sales last year—in favor of medicines from Eli Lilly and others. Novo Nordisk's competitors probably offered substantial discounts to get on the PBM's favored-drug list. CVS Health, meanwhile, said it will exclude Sanofi's long-acting insulin drugs Lantus and Toujeo (expected to combine for $6.8 billion in sales this year) next year in favor of Eli Lilly's similar drug, Basaglar, which rolls out in mid-December. UnitedHealth, a large health insurer that also has a large PBM segment, revealed it was doing the same. As new drugs and drug combinations hit the market and PBMs aggressively curate their favored drug lists, drugmakers are forced to continually raise the rebates, or discounts, they make to payers to stay competitive. For example, the implied rebate—the percentage of gross drug sales given away in rebates and other discounts—Sanofi gives for its drug Lantus has grown from around 10 percent in 2009 to nearly 60 percent last quarter, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. The discounting could get even more severe when Eli Lilly's rival drug Basaglar hits the U.S. market. This is happening to many diabetes drugs. Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk's short-acting insulins have implied rebates of about 70 percent, according to BI. Newer diabetes drugs in different classes, such as Eli Lilly's Trulicity, Merck's Januvia, and Novo's Victoza, also have large and rising rebates. Such price competition does not tend to suddenly reverse. It's actually more likely to increase—agreements between payers and drugmakers get renegotiated every year, and PBMs have gotten more savvy and aggressive about playing companies against each other to get the biggest possible discounts, especially in large drug classes. For an example of the kind of impact this has on revenue, consider Sanofi's Lantus, the biggest-selling diabetes drug. Since 2014, Wall Street's consensus forecast for the drug's 2017 sales has fallen from $7.1 billion to $5.1 billion. Lantus is expected to fall below $4 billion in sales by 2019.   Those 1,000 job cuts will likely not be the last.

Continued Its Downfall Today Waiting for data is never easy. Brian Orelli (TMFBiologyFool) Sep 29, 2016 at 5:18PM Image source: Getty Images. What happened Exelixis (NASDAQ:EXEL) continued its fall today, down as much as 12% and ending the day down 8%, after falling 14% yesterday. So what? Today's move seems to be a continuation of yesterday. The momentum down shouldn't come as much of a surprise. Just look at the upward movement Exelixis' stock has experienced since the approval of its kidney cancer drug Cabometyx in April. EXEL data by YCharts. Despite the massive increase since approval, there hasn't been much data that changes Exelixis' valuation since the approval. In August, the biotech released sales numbers for the first nine weeks Cabometyx was on the market, but even that increase looks like a small blip on the above chart despite actually representing a one-day 18% increase in shares. Given investors' propensity to hit the buy button despite the lack of information on the expectation that Exelixis will be able to move into first-line kidney cancer patients, it shouldn't come as much of a surprise that investors are hitting the sell button at the first sign that the picture might not be as rosy as it could be. We already know that CABOSUN, a clinical trial testing Cabometyx against Pfizer's (NYSE:PFE) Sutent in first-line kidney cancer, showed that Cabometyx was superior to Sutent. But details of the trial, including by how much Cabometyx beat Pfizer's drug, have been kept under wraps prior to a scientific meeting: the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) meeting next month. The issue has become how much of that first-line indication Cabometyx can capture given the potential of the combination of Pfizer's Inlyta and Merck's Keytruda in kidney cancer, which appears to be working in the same setting, according to an ESMO abstract released yesterday. Of course, that data comes from an uncontrolled phase 1b trial, so it will remain unclear how the two treatments might work in a head-to-head competition even after Exelixis is given the opportunity to present the CABOSUN data at ESMO. Now what? Investors hate seeing shares of their companies go down for apparently little reason, but they never seem to mind it when shares increase for the same reason (or lack thereof). Long-term investors should strap in for the ride, because it could continue to be a bumpy between now and October 10, when the CABOSUN data is presented at ESMO.

Approximately 10 hedge funds were reducing their exposure in Deutsche Bank, according to a Bloomberg report. "The European banks took too long to recapitalize coming out of the crisis and you had the Eurozone crisis on top of it," said Troy Gayeski, partner and senior portfolio manager at SkyBridge Capital on Bloomberg. "What you're seeing now is the Eurozone banking issues hangs appall over all of Europe. We don't expect massive systemic risk like you had in 2008. But until the banking system cleans up its really hard to see European assets, particularly equities, getting a bit at all. Europe's been liquidated. Everyone knows what the story is. But why would investors come back until the Deutsche Bank issues are cleared up?" Deutsche Bank's price of shares sunk 6.67 percent to close at $11.48. Since peaking on July 31, 2015, shares of the Frankfurt-based company have fallen more than 65 percent. Overall, it was a bearish day on Wall Street after two consecutive days of gains. At one point, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) had dropped 248 points but would rally to finish down 195.79 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 18,143.45. The biggest decliners were Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which fell 2.75 percent, followed by Merck & Co. (MRK), which dropped 2.20 percent and Nike Inc. (NKE) which dipped 2.05 percent. Pfizer Inc. (PFE) dropped 1.97 percent as shares of health-care stocks dipped on worries of tighter regulations. Meanwhile, Apple Inc. (AAPL) fell 1.55 percent after Barclays cut its price target. Apple's shares have dipped 3.45 percent since reaching a high of $116.18 on Sept. 19. Join the Discussion Most Read Everything You Need To Know, Right Now.

Energy stocks led most markets higher on Thursday, Sept. 29, after OPEC nations reached a preliminary deal to cut oil production for the first time in eight years. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) SEOUL, South Korea - Global stock markets were sharply lower Friday as investor sentiment was dented by renewed worries about the financial health of Deutsche Bank following reports that some hedge funds were moving their businesses out of Germany's biggest bank. KEEPING SCORE: European stocks started lower. Britain's FTSE 100 fell 1.1 per cent to 6,847.05 while France's CAC 40 sank 1.7 per cent to 4,366.89. Germany's DAX lost 1.6 per cent to 10,243.71. Futures augured a tepid start on Wall Street. S&P futures and Dow futures both lost 0.2 per cent. ANALYST'S TAKE: "Risk sentiment waned overnight as worries about global banks weighed on markets," said Alex Wijaya, senior sales trader at CMC Markets in Singapore. "Stock markets worldwide are rattled by the latest development at Deutsche Bank." BANK WOES: Shares of Deutsche Bank nosedived to below 10 euros a share for the first time after reports said some hedge funds have taken measures to reduce risks associated with the German bank. The company has been a source of concerns for investors for weeks since U.S. authorities disclosed that they are seeking $14 billion from the bank to settle legal claims over its sales of mortgage securities in 2007 and 2008. The bank said it had struck a deal to sell a subsidiary and stressed that it was not seeking government help, but investors are worried about what will happen to Germany's biggest lender and to the broader financial system if Deutsche Bank runs low on capital. Analysts said the bank's troubles are raising scrutiny over other banks in Europe, which are also in talks regarding mortgage settlements with U.S. authorities. CHINA OUTPUT: The Caixin monthly purchasing managers' index, which is closely watched for insights into China's economy, ticked up to 50.1 for September from the previous month's 50.0 reading. The tiny expansion in activity and gains in overall new orders for the third straight month offered a glimmer of hope for the world's second-largest economy that has been grappling with a prolonged slowdown. But the private survey result was not strong enough to relieve investors outside China. ASIA'S DAY: Japan's Nikkei 225 slumped 1.5 per cent to 16,449.84 and South Korea's Kospi fell 1.2 per cent to 2,043.63. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index sank 1.9 per cent to 23,297.15. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 dropped 0.7 per cent to 5,435.90. China's Shanghai Composite Index was up 0.2 per cent to 3,004.70. Stocks in Singapore and other Southeast Asian countries were lower. OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude lost 54 cents to $47.29 per barrel in New York. The contract gained 78 cents, or 1.7 per cent, to close at $47.83 a barrel on Thursday. Oil prices surged earlier this week after the nations of OPEC, which collectively produce more than third of the world's oil, agreed to a small cut in production in a surprise decision. Brent crude, the international benchmark, fell 61 cents to $49.20 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar fell to 101.03 yen from 101.16 yen while the euro weakened to $1.118 from $1.122.       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *       FILE - In this Monday, Sept. 26, 2016, file photo, trader James Dresch, center, works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.

KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 slumped 1.6 percent to 16,435.61 and South Korea's Kospi fell 0.9 percent to 2,051.10. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index retreated 1.3 percent to 23,440.84. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 dropped 0.8 percent to 5,425.80. China's Shanghai Composite Index was up 0.1 percent to 3,000.58. Stocks in Singapore and other Southeast Asian countries were also lower. ANALYST'S TAKE: "Risk sentiment waned overnight as worries about global banks weighed on markets," said Alex Wijaya, senior sales trader at CMC Markets in Singapore. "Stock markets worldwide are rattled by the latest development at Deutsche Bank." BANK WOES: U.S. authorities are seeking $14 billion from Deutsche Bank to settle legal claims over its sales of mortgage securities in 2007 and 2008, which helped kick off a global financial crisis. The bank said it had struck a deal to sell a subsidiary and stressed that it was not seeking government help but investors are worried what will happen to Germany's biggest lender and to the broader financial system if Deutsche Bank runs low on capital. Analysts said the troubles at Deutsche Bank are raising scrutiny over other banks in Europe, which are also in talks regarding mortgage settlement with the U.S. authorities. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks finished lower on Thursday as drug companies and banks absorbed large losses. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 195.79 points, or 1.1 percent, to 18,143.45. The Standard & Poor's 500 index sank 20.24 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,151.13. The Nasdaq composite dropped 49.39 points, or 0.9 percent, to 5,269.15. OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude lost 20 cents to $47.62 per barrel in New York. The contract gained 78 cents, or 1.7 percent, to close at $47.83 a barrel on Thursday. Oil prices surged earlier this week after the nations of OPEC, which collectively produce more than third of the world's oil, agreed to a small cut in production in a surprise decision Brent crude, the international benchmark, fell 36 cents to $49.45 a barrel in London.

Biological drugs, based on monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) would emerge as a preferred option for treating various cancer types, especially blood cancer (leukaemia). The rising incidence and prevalence of various cancer types, new cancer treatments and growing importance of biological and targeted drug therapies, are driving the market growth of LAMEA oncology/anti-cancer drugs. In addition, increasing demand of anti-cancer drugs for the treatment of ageing population, rising government funds and improved treatment results, are major factors boosting the market growth. However, the high cost involved in new drug development, coupled with threat of failure and adverse effects associated with anti-cancer drugs therapies, would restrain the growth of the LAMEA market. Moreover, accessibility of anti-cancer drugs incurred by high cost, is a major challenge that is expected to further impede the performance of anti-cancer drugs in LAMEA region. Nevertheless, commercialization of advanced therapeutics, such as targeted therapies and immunotherapies (biologic therapies) would reduce the negative influence of restraints and fuel the market growth. Browse Full Report with Toc : http://www.acutemarketreports.com/report/lamea-oncology-anti-cancer-drugs-market  The LAMEA oncology drugs market is segmented into therapeutic modalities, cancer types and countries. Therapeutic modalities segment is further categorized into chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy (biologic therapy), hormonal therapy and others. The LAMEA oncology drugs market is expected to reach $17,072.2 million by 2021. Patent expiration of key anti-cancer drugs such as Herceptin (Patent Expiration: EU-2014; US-2019), Erbitux (Patent Expiration: EU-2014; US-2016), Rituxan (Patent Expiration: EU-2013; US-2018) and Avastin (Patent Expiration: EU-2018; US-2019), is expected to boost the growth of cancer biosimilars market by 2021. Further, the biological therapy is the fastest growing segment at a CAGR of 12.2%, throughout the analysis period, on account of high efficacy and target specific action. Moreover, blood cancer drugs market was the largest revenue generating application segment in 2015, owing to the high cost of drugs (immunotherapies), used for the treatment of blood cancer. Based on countries the LAMEA region is segmented into nine countries named Brazil, Argentina, Nigeria, South Africa, Iraq, Iran, Algeria, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Brazil dominates the LAMEA market closely followed by Argentina, owing to rising incidence of cancer, high expenditure and gross national income (GNI) of Brazil specifically. In addition, LAMEA market is poised to grow at a promising CAGR of 8.6% during the forecast period. This high growth rate is majorly attributed to the increasing awareness towards advanced therapies, namely immunotherapies and increase in per capita healthcare spending.

Menendez Vote Reflects Support of Corporate Political Spending Disclosure Print Email Jonathan D. Salant | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com By Jonathan D. Salant | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 29, 2016 at 6:50 AM, updated September 29, 2016 at 6:05 PM comments WASHINGTON— A growing number of public companies are voluntarily disclosing their corporate donations to trade associations and other nonprofits, and U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez wants to require all of them to reveal their political spending. Such New Jersey companies as Becton, Dickinson & Co. of Frankin Lakes and Prudential Financial of Newark were among the most transparent, according to a report issued Thursday by the Center for Political Accountability and the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School's Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research. On the other side, the Parsippany-based animal health company Zoetis and the retailer Bed, Bath & Beyond, based in Union, were among the worst in terms of disclosure, according to the report. "You have a responsibility to your investors to tell them what you do and what you don't do," center president Bruce Freed said. "You see the improvements from year to year. That is very important."  N.J. senators: Require spending disclosure While political action committee donations already must be reported, the Washington-based Center for Political Accountability is pushing companies to also disclose what they've spent from the corporate treasury, such as dues to trade groups or contributions to nonprofits that spend money on political advertising. Of 493 companies listed in the Standard & Poor's index, 224 report their donations to trade groups or prohibit such contributions, up from 204 a year ago; and 153 disclose donations to nonprofits or ban those, an increase from 125 in 2015. Voluntary disclosure has become more important as the amount of secret money pouring into campaigns continues to grow in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision. Money spent by groups that keep their donors secret tripled to $300 million in 2012 from $100 million in 2008, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based research group. The Securities and Exchange Commission is considering requiring public companies to disclose their political spending, but the spending bill keeping the federal government open through Dec. 9 includes a Senate Republican-authored provision blocking the agency from moving ahead. Menendez on Wednesday voted against the spending bill, citing the anti-disclosure provision. U.S. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) also voted no. Congress will have to fun the government after Dec. 9, and Menendez said he will fight to keep the provision out of that spending bill. A member of the Senate Banking Committee, Menendez has introduced legislation prohibiting companies from making political expenditures from their corporate treasuries unless a majority of shareholders approve, and has pushed the SEC to issue its own disclosure rule. "It is important to shareholders and investors to know how their money is being spent," Menendez said in an interview. "It casts a bright light on dark money. It would ultimately have a chilling effect on the use of corporate money in elections if companies had to disclose what they were spending and who they were spending it on." Indeed, corporations have run into trouble with their political spending. Target Corp. faced a boycott by gay-rights groups in 2010 after donating $150,000 to a business group backing a gubernatorial candidate in Minnesota who opposed same-sex marriage. And while the Merck & Co. and Comcast Corp. PACs backed Booker's run for Senate, they also contributed to trade associations that helped fund a nonprofit group spending money to defeat him. The report also singled out Public Service Enterprise Group, based in Newark, for its increased disclosure. Spokeswoman Kate Vossen said the company last year began disclosing its corporate spending "in an effort to continuously improve our transparency." "Prudential recognizes the importance of participation in the American democratic process," spokeswoman Laura Burke said. "Our culture of strong governance drives our commitment to transparency in all disclosures.  We are pleased to be recognized for our commitment to transparency in this recent report."  Becton and Bed, Bath and Beyond did not respond to a request for comment. Zoetis was at the bottom of the index with a score of zero, meaning the company did not undertake any steps to disclose corporate political spending. "Zoetis is committed to good corporate governance practices and transparency, and we make all the required federal and state disclosures for political activities," said Bill Price, a vice president.

Shortly after the conference, the presentation will be available on the Ablynx website under the R&D portfolio section (http://www.ablynx.com/rd-portfolio/clinical-programmes/caplacizumab/). Acquired TTP is an acute, ultra-rare, life-threatening blood clotting disorder in which uncontrolled platelet aggregation and microclot formation cause small blood vessel occlusions throughout the body[1] (#_ftn1), resulting in thrombotic complications and widespread organ damage[2] (#_ftn2). Despite the current standard-of-care treatment of daily plasma exchange (PEX) and immunosuppression, episodes of aTTP are still associated with a mortality rate of up to 20%, with most deaths occurring within 30 days of diagnosis[3] (#_ftn3). Furthermore, patients are at risk of acute thromboembolic complications (e.g. stroke, venous thrombosis and myocardial infarction) and of recurrence of disease. In addition, some patients are refractory to therapy[4] (#_ftn4), which is associated with a very poor prognosis for survival of an acute episode of aTTP. Data from the French Reference Center for Thrombotic Microangiopathies showed that 50% of patients who died from an acute episode were refractory to treatment[5] (#_ftn5). Post-hoc analyses of the Phase II TITAN study data were performed to assess the impact of caplacizumab on a composite endpoint of major thromboembolic complications and aTTP-related mortality, as well as on refractoriness to standard treatment. The results demonstrate that a clinically meaningful lower proportion of subjects treated with caplacizumab experienced one or more major thromboembolic events, or died, as compared to placebo (11.4% versus 43.2%). In addition, fewer caplacizumab-treated patients, compared to those who received placebo, were refractory[6] (#_ftn6) to treatment (5.7% versus 21.6%; and 0% versus 10.8%, respectively depending on the definition of refractoriness4). There were two deaths in the placebo group and both those patients were refractory to treatment; no deaths were reported in the caplacizumab group. A Phase III confirmatory study of caplacizumab is currently ongoing which includes prospectively defined assessments of these clinically relevant endpoints. Professor Flora Peyvandi, Principal Investigator for the TITAN study at IRCCS Maggiore Hospital Foundation, University of Milan, Italy, commented: "Acquired TTP is a very severe disease with high unmet medical need. Any new treatment option would need to act fast to immediately inhibit the formation of micro-clots in order to protect the patient during the acute phase of the disease and so have the potential to avoid the resulting complications. The topline results and the subsequent post-hoc analyses of the Phase II TITAN data demonstrate that caplacizumab has the potential to reduce the major morbidity and mortality associated with acquired TTP, and confirm our conviction that it should become an important pillar in the management of acquired TTP." About caplacizumab Caplacizumab is a highly potent and selective bivalent anti-von Willebrand Factor (vWF) Nanobody that received Orphan Drug Designation in the United States and Europe in 2009. Caplacizumab blocks the interaction of ultra-large vWF multimers (ULvWF) with platelets and, therefore, has an immediate effect on platelet aggregation and the ensuing formation and accumulation of the microclots that cause the severe thrombocytopenia and organ and tissue damage in aTTP. This immediate effect protects the patient from the manifestations of the disease while the underlying disease process resolves. The efficacy and safety of caplacizumab in conjunction with the standard of care (PEX) were evaluated in the Phase II TITAN study in 75 patients with aTTP. Caplacizumab was well-tolerated and the primary endpoint of reduction in time to platelet normalisation was met (p=0.005). Treatment with caplacizumab resulted in a nearly 40% reduction in time to platelet count normalisation as compared to placebo (i.e., a faster reversion of thrombocytopenia with consequent reduced use of PEX). Moreover, during treatment, caplacizumab reduced aTTP recurrences by 71% compared to placebo when administered as an adjunct to standard of care[7] (#_ftn7).  These Phase II results will serve as the basis for filing for conditional approval of caplacizumab in Europe in early 2017. The confirmatory Phase III HERCULES study is currently ongoing and will support the BLA filing in the United States. Results from this Phase III study are expected by the end of 2017. Caplacizumab has the potential to be the first therapeutic specifically approved for the treatment of acquired TTP. About aTTP aTTP is an acute, ultra-rare, life-threatening, blood clotting disorder, affecting up to 11 per million people worldwide. It has a sudden onset caused by impaired activity of the ADAMTS13 enzyme (typically <10% of that in normal plasma), leaving ULvWF molecules uncleaved (vWF is an important protein involved in the blood clotting process). These ULvWF molecules spontaneously bind to blood platelets, resulting in severe thrombocytopenia (very low platelet count) and micro-clot formation in small blood vessels throughout the body, leading to thrombotic complications and widespread organ damage. Up to 20% of patients die from an initial aTTP episode with most deaths occurring within 30 days of diagnosis. In addition to the acute risks of the disease, patients experiencing an episode of aTTP may suffer long-term consequences such as cognitive deficits, depression, and arterial hypertension[8] (#_ftn8), and are at risk for recurrence. The recurrence rate ranges from 10-84%[9] (#_ftn9) and typically occur within 1-2 years[10] (#_ftn10), but recurrences have been reported up to 30 years after the initial episode[11] (#_ftn11).

Note that the exact reason why azithromycin would have such a beneficial impact in women undergoing cesarean delivery is unknown, although broad spectrum antibiotics could potentially be more effective than cefazolin against existing pathogens in the vaginal microbiome. Women given azithromycin on top of standard antibiotic prophylaxis during cesarean delivery had a lower rate of post-delivery infections than women who received placebo plus standard prophylaxis in a randomized trial. Compared with women receiving cefazolin (the standard antibiotic prophylaxis prior to cesarean section) plus placebo, women who received cefazolin plus azithromycin were linked with significantly lower rates of endometritis, wound infection, and other infections, reported Alan T.N. Tita, MD, of University of Alabama at Birmingham, and colleagues. The full results of this study, which were partially presented earlier this year at the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine annual meeting, were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Uma Reddy, MD, of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, which funded the research, characterized this as "strong evidence" on the important topic of decreasing maternal mortality. "The rate of maternal death in the U.S. has increased, so research that focuses on how to decrease serious complications like this are still very much needed," she told MedPage Today. "Any intervention that can decrease complication from c-sections will have major impact on pregnancy outcomes and the health of women." Better Outcomes with Broad Spectrum Co-author William Andrews, MD, also of University of Alabama at Birmingham, told MedPage Today that earlier research indicated the potential benefit of an expanded antibiotic approach, but it included smaller studies that involved a more complex regimen of three antibiotics. An accompanying editorial by Robert A. Weinstein, MD, and Kenneth M. Boyer, MD, both of Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, theorized on why administering azithromycin would have such a beneficial impact in women undergoing cesarean delivery. Both the authors and editorialists noted that broad spectrum antibiotics could potentially be more effective against existing pathogens in the vaginal microbiome that increase the risk of infection, which cefazolin lacks the ability to do. "We focused on azithromycin because it covers Ureaplasma organisms, which are more commonly associated with infections after cesarean section than anaerobes when specific cultures are performed and because it has been associated with reduced risks of both wound infections and endometritis," Tita and colleagues wrote. But Weinstein and Boyer also argued that another reason why the additional antibiotic may have worked was that cefazolin could have been underdosed in this population -- three-quarters of which had a BMI of over 30. "Azithromycin [may have] improved outcomes on the basis of the additive effects of the two drugs against common surgical pathogens, such as staphylococcus species," the editorialists argued. The C/SOAP trial randomized 2,013 women with a singleton pregnancy and a gestational age of 24 weeks or more to the two treatment arms. A significant difference in the rate of postoperative complications within 6 weeks (a composite of endometritis, wound infection and other infections) was observed in the azithromycin group compared with placebo (6.1% versus 12.0%, respectively, P<0.001). While there were significant differences in the rate of serious maternal adverse events between the two groups (1.5% for azithromycin group versus 2.9% for placebo, P=0.03), there were no differences in secondary neonatal outcomes (a composite of neonatal death and serious neonatal complications) between the two groups (14.3% vs 13.6%, respectively, P=0.63). Time for a Guideline Change? Andrews characterized this course of treatment as a "simple approach," noting that azithromycin is relatively inexpensive and readily available antibiotic. "These infections are associated with considerable expense, discomfort, occasionally even maternal death," he told MedPage Today. "Thus, I believe that ob/gyn's should consider adopting this expanded-spectrum antibiotic coverage based on the results of this study." Current guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists currently lack a specific recommendation for this particular antibiotic for use in cesarean delivery, but Reddy said that she hoped that might change, given the results of this study. "It will be up to professional societies, such as ACOG, to come up with guidance, but this research provides important evidence that this antibiotic may decrease infection-related complications by half," she argued. However, Weinstein and Boyer were cautious in interpreting these results. They noted that this particular group of higher-risk patients may have been more likely to benefit from azithromycin, and that higher doses of cefazolin could be evaluated prior to adding an additional antibiotic. The editorialists also suggested additional research about the potential impact of an additional antibiotic on the maternal and infant microbiome. This study was supported in part by a grant from the NICHD. The azithromycin used in the study was provided by Pfizer through an investigator-initiated grant.
