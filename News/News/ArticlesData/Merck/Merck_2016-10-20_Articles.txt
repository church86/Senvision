ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ MUMBAI: German drug maker Merck has merged its pharmaceuticals and consumer healthcare businesses as part of a major makeover unique to India aimed at building scale and ramping up local business with a hybrid model. Merck’s ambition is to push its established primary care and vitamins and mineral supplements businesses alongside new launches from its market-leading fertility and oncology divisions. Its strategy of uniting the two businesses locally runs counter to some global drug makers that have separated the two businesses. The German drug maker, also known to be the oldest pharmaceutical company in the world, clocked 17% growth on the 12-month MAT from Sept 2015 to Sept 2016, is ranked the second fastest growing multinational drug firm after Janssen in India. “We have brought together the portfolios of what we used to call primary care, mainly vitamins and mineral supplements with the portfolio of our consumer health divisions which have major leading brands. So we are consumerising primary health portfolio and that will now represent 70% of our business in India. It is very fast growing and this new approach will be able to capture a very attractive market and much faster,” said Belen Garijo, global CEO at Merck, on her second visit to India in as many years. In biopharmaceuticals, Merck sells Gonal-F for fertility, Erbitux for cancer and in cardio-metabolic it has Concor as a top selling brand. In the consumer health business Merck has grown 20%, with sales of .`800 crore last year. Its top brands include Neurobion, Seven Seas, Nasivon and Polybion. Apart from the two categories, Merck’s overall business in India includes products under life sciences and material sciences. The total sales stood at around Rs 2400 crore last year. The $16 billion drug maker, with a research collaboration with Pfizer for cancer drugs, is hopeful of launching avelumab (for lung cancer) globally next year and work with regulatory bodies to make the drug available in India. Avelumab received breakthrough status from the US FDA and is undergoing advanced clinical trials in India. Merck has a busy schedule for new introductions in India in the next two years. By mid-2018, the company may look to bring its fertility technologies. In the neuro degenerative diseases, Merck is likely to add Cladribine in 2018 subject to positive outcome and approvals in developed markets. In consumer health, Merck said it may launch ‘Perfect Seven - Seven Seas Man’ and ‘Perfect Seven-Seven Seas Woman in 2017. Merck has collaboration with Lupin, signed in 2014 to accelerate its general medicine and cardio-metabolic portfolio in emerging markets. Garijo noted the alliance is moving as planned and both two sides want to bring products to market in 2018. She said the alliance with Dr. Reddy's to develop select biosimilars is also moving satisfactorily. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

AgWired Animal Ag Precision Energy AgNewsWire ZimmComm Navigation Subscribe Advertise About Subscribe Advertise About Merck’s Latest Updates to Dairy Care365 Merck’s Latest Updates to Dairy Care365 Lizzy Schultz October 20, 2016 Leave a Comment Facebook Twitter Email Print Merck Animal Health was on hand during the 2016 World Dairy Expo to talk with producers about the latest updates to Dairy Care365, an online training series that was developed to train, equip and support dairy producers, employees and veterinarians so they’re able to provide the best possible care for dairy animals 365 days a year. Dr. Mike Bolton, DVM, a member of Merck’s Dairy Technical Services team, sat down for an interview during this year’s Dairy Expo. He talked some of the features available as the series has updated and how they fit nicely into the increasing regulations and requirements facing dairy producers in the next year. The Dairy Care365 program is part of a partnership between Merck and the National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF), the creators of the National Dairy FARM Program for animal care. Two of the programs newest videos in the series are part of a two-episode module on bio-awarism, which focuses on providing farm employees with a diverse overview of proper biosecurity protocol. “Bio-awarism is a combination of biosecurity, threats from outside of your farm and threats from within your operation, and the videos explain to workers why they have to follow these requirements and what is important to keep the disease within your farm on a controlled level by managing flow and traffic on your farm,” said Dr. Bolton. “The videos talk a lot about things that aren’t rocket science but definitely bear repeating: Things like proper vaccine handling, impressing on employees why its not a good idea to take a shortcut through the sick pen to feed the calves, things that like that, which are common sense ideas that they may not have had much education on.” Learn more in Jamie’s full interview with Dr. Bolton here: Interview with Dr. Mike Bolton, DVM, Merck View and download photos from the event here: 2016 World Dairy Expo Photo Album.

(MRK) Stock Now MRK stock's momentum isn't going to end anytime soon By Ryan Fuhrmann, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Oct 20, 2016, 12:49 pm EST     View All   Popular Posts: 3 Beaten-Down Healthcare Stocks to Buy Recent Posts: 3 Beaten-Down Healthcare Stocks to Buy 3 Blue-Chip Stocks With Hidden Benefits Nothing Can Stop Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) Stock Now View All Posts Shares of pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) have been on a roll lately. MRK stock jumped last week and reached its highest levels over the past year. It also returned to highs last seen in 2001, a distant memory considering this was back when the dot-com bubble was still bursting. Returning to its all-time highs of nearly two decades ago will still take time, but Merck stock’s momentum could easily continue. Source: Ryan via Wikimedia (Modified) The positive news for MRK stemmed from favorable results for a cancer drug called Keytruda that treats non-small cell lung cancer. The drug is in a category of revolutionary treatments known as immunoncology that use the body’s own immune system to tackle even the most serious cancerous tumors. More on that below. Pharma rival Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY) offers a competing treatment called Opdivo, which also focuses on NSCLC but targets a larger class of patients. Merck & Co.’s drug is more targeted to patients with a higher level of a protein called PD-L1, and the recent results confirmed it works better in patients with these higher levels. Bristol also released results to indicate this to be the case. The market’s recent excitement about MRK is certainly warranted and continues a trend of positive news for Keytruda over Opdivo. However, the case can be made that both drugs stand a good chance of generating several billions of dollars in new sales within a couple of years for both firms. 7 Tech Stocks That Will Ride Healthcare to Riches The emphasis on Keytruda is also overshadowing Merck’s overall appeal as a worthy investment candidate in the pharmaceutical industry. Merck & Co. and the Overall Appeal of Pharma Overall, the pharmaceutical industry is a great place to find appealing individual investment opportunities. Patent expiration of major “blockbuster” drugs meant lost revenue for many years, but that appeared to bottom out last year. For all of 2016, the industry is projected to report positive sales. The immunoncology space has perhaps the best potential for investment upside. In addition to MRK and Bristol, biotechnology (closely related to pharma, especially the larger players) firm Amgen, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) sells IO-based drug Blincyto to combat leukemia. AstraZeneca plc (ADR) (NYSE:AZN) is looking to beef up its IO research over time. Kite Pharma Inc (NASDAQ:KITE) is a smaller biotech firm competing in the space and is focused on blood cancers, including leukemia and lymphomas. Pharma stocks are also trading at very reasonable P/E ratios right now. Many are well below market multiples, which currently stand at 24.3 on a trailing basis and 18.1 on a forward basis. This basic measure of a stock’s value is simple, but important, and as we’ll see with MRK stock, looking at both the historical and prospective level can be important. Finally, the prospect of higher interest rates could be having an adverse effect on the share prices of firms in industries with above-average dividend yields. This is because investors are starting to shift back to bonds at the expense of income-producing stocks. Yields are still low, but the prices of bonds are much less volatile than stocks. This could explain the recent tepid performance of pharma stocks. Most of the key players again sport yields above 3%, which is well above the market average of 2.1%. Merck Stock in Focus MRK stock has momentum right now. It operates in an appealing industry, and is a first mover in the IO space. Merck & Co. stock is currently riding high, while Bristol’s stock has fallen to $50 per share, or 35% below its highs in the past year. In addition to Keytruda, Merck has an appealing offering of new and existing drugs, and those in the pipeline have strong potential. Januvia is Merck & Co.’s top selling drug and treats diabetes. Bridion is an anesthetic. Zepatier treats hepatitis C and will start competing with offerings from Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) and AbbVie Inc (NYSE:ABBV). MRK also has a sizeable offering to treat HIV and a promising pipeline in the space.

Debio 1143 is currently in Phase II development for Head & Neck and Ovarian Cancer. Avelumab is under clinical investigation across a broad range of tumor types by the Merck-Pfizer Alliance. Under the terms of the agreement, Debiopharm will be responsible for conducting the Phase I/Ib clinical trial in NSCLC. "We are delighted to initiate this collaboration in immuno-oncology with the Merck-Pfizer Alliance. It is a great opportunity to explore in the clinic the immunomodulatory properties of Debio 1143 observed in preclinical studies," said Dr Chris Freitag, Vice President, Clinical Research & Development, Debiopharm International SA. "We are hopeful that the immunosensitizing effect of our compound in combination with avelumab may translate into a potentially better treatment outcome for patients suffering from this major debilitating disease." Globally, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women, responsible for more deaths than colon, breast and prostate cancer combined.[1] NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for 80-85% of all lung cancers.[2] The 5-year survival rate for people diagnosed with late-stage lung cancer that has spread (metastasized) to other areas of the body is 4%.[3] "Inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has shown promising activity in patients with advanced NSCLC," said Alise Reicin, M.D., Head of Global Clinical Development in the biopharma business of Merck. "We hope that our exploration of avelumab as a combination therapy with Debio 1143 will generate results that could potentially one day make a real difference to patients fighting this deadly cancer." "Investigating the potential of combination therapy is an important strategic focus for the Merck-Pfizer Alliance," said Chris Boshoff, M.D., Ph.D., Head of Immuno-Oncology, Early Development, and Translational Oncology at Pfizer. "This collaboration with Debiopharm provides a significant opportunity to explore the potential synergistic effects of these two agents in combination." About Debio 1143  Debio 1143 is an oral, small molecule inhibitor of IAPs (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins) that promotes apoptosis of cancer cells by mimicking the activity of the natural Second Mitochondrial-derived Activator of Caspases (SMAC). Evasion of apoptosis is a hallmark of cancer and a common mechanism of resistance to current treatments and Debio 1143 is being investigated as chemo- and radio-sensitizer in Ovarian Cancer and Head & Neck Cancer. In addition, like other members of the class, Debio 1143 displays strong immunomodulatory properties that make it a natural candidate for combination with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors. About Avelumab  Avelumab (also known as MSB0010718C) is an investigational, fully human antibody specific for a protein found on tumor cells called PD-L1, or programmed death ligand-1. Avelumab is thought to have a dual mechanism of action which may enable the immune system to find and attack cancer cells. By binding to PD-L1, avelumab is thought to prevent tumor cells from using PD-L1 for protection against white blood cells such as T-cells, exposing them to anti-tumor responses. Avelumab is also thought to help white blood cells such as natural killer (NK) cells find and attack tumors in a process known as ADCC, or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In November 2014, Merck, the science and technology company, and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab. About Debiopharm International SA  Debiopharm Group(TM) is a Swiss-based global biopharmaceutical group of five companies active in the development and manufacture of drugs and diagnostics tools. Debiopharm focuses on developing prescription drugs that target unmet medical needs. The group in-licenses and develops promising drug candidates. The products are commercialized by pharmaceutical out-licensing partners to give access to the largest number of patients worldwide.

Debio 1143 is currently in Phase II development for Head & Neck and Ovarian Cancer. Avelumab is under clinical investigation across a broad range of tumor types by the Merck-Pfizer Alliance. Under the terms of the agreement, Debiopharm will be responsible for conducting the Phase I/Ib clinical trial in NSCLC. "We are delighted to initiate this collaboration in immuno-oncology with the Merck-Pfizer Alliance. It is a great opportunity to explore in the clinic the immunomodulatory properties of Debio 1143 observed in preclinical studies," said Dr Chris Freitag, Vice President, Clinical Research & Development, Debiopharm International SA. "We are hopeful that the immunosensitizing effect of our compound in combination with avelumab may translate into a potentially better treatment outcome for patients suffering from this major debilitating disease." Globally, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women, responsible for more deaths than colon, breast and prostate cancer combined.[1] NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for 80-85% of all lung cancers.[2] The 5-year survival rate for people diagnosed with late-stage lung cancer that has spread (metastasized) to other areas of the body is 4%.[3] "Inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has shown promising activity in patients with advanced NSCLC," said Alise Reicin, M.D., Head of Global Clinical Development in the biopharma business of Merck. "We hope that our exploration of avelumab as a combination therapy with Debio 1143 will generate results that could potentially one day make a real difference to patients fighting this deadly cancer." "Investigating the potential of combination therapy is an important strategic focus for the Merck-Pfizer Alliance," said Chris Boshoff, M.D., Ph.D., Head of Immuno-Oncology, Early Development, and Translational Oncology at Pfizer. "This collaboration with Debiopharm provides a significant opportunity to explore the potential synergistic effects of these two agents in combination." About Debio 1143  Debio 1143 is an oral, small molecule inhibitor of IAPs (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins) that promotes apoptosis of cancer cells by mimicking the activity of the natural Second Mitochondrial-derived Activator of Caspases (SMAC). Evasion of apoptosis is a hallmark of cancer and a common mechanism of resistance to current treatments and Debio 1143 is being investigated as chemo- and radio-sensitizer in Ovarian Cancer and Head & Neck Cancer. In addition, like other members of the class, Debio 1143 displays strong immunomodulatory properties that make it a natural candidate for combination with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors. About Avelumab  Avelumab (also known as MSB0010718C) is an investigational, fully human antibody specific for a protein found on tumor cells called PD-L1, or programmed death ligand-1. Avelumab is thought to have a dual mechanism of action which may enable the immune system to find and attack cancer cells. By binding to PD-L1, avelumab is thought to prevent tumor cells from using PD-L1 for protection against white blood cells such as T-cells, exposing them to anti-tumor responses. Avelumab is also thought to help white blood cells such as natural killer (NK) cells find and attack tumors in a process known as ADCC, or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In November 2014, Merck, the science and technology company, and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab. About Debiopharm International SA  Debiopharm Group(TM) is a Swiss-based global biopharmaceutical group of five companies active in the development and manufacture of drugs and diagnostics tools. Debiopharm focuses on developing prescription drugs that target unmet medical needs. The group in-licenses and develops promising drug candidates. The products are commercialized by pharmaceutical out-licensing partners to give access to the largest number of patients worldwide.

Letermovir (AIC426) is being tested for prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus (CMV) activation in patients receiving haematopoietic stem cell transplants - an indication which according to Credit Suisse forecasts could make it a $350m market by the end of the decade. Letermovir has been granted orphan drug status in the EU and the US, and has also been earmarked for fast-track review by the FDA. There is a significant need for additional medicines for the treatment of CMV infection, which is one of the most common viral infections affecting transplant patients. CMV is a herpes virus, infecting 50-90% of the adult population, with a majority remaining without symptoms. However, without preventive drugs approximately 80% of CMV-seropositive patients experience CMV infection after an allogeneic (donor) HSCT, which can lead to organ damage and symptoms such as visual impairment, pneumonia and hepatitis. Current drugs such as valganciclovir target CMV DNA polymerase and tend to be associated with poor oral bioavailability, the development of resistance and dose-limiting toxicities such as kidney damage and anaemia. Letermovir goes after another enzyme - viral terminase - and so could provide another line of therapy for resistant infections, while data from a phase II trial suggests it also has a good tolerability profile. Merck licensed the rights to develop and commercialize letermovir - along with a back-up candidate and other early-stage candidates that act against CMV via an alternate mechanism - from Germany's AiCuris in 2012. AiCuris - which was formed as a spin-out from Bayer's anti-infectives unit in 2006 - pocketed an upfront payment of €110m and - with milestone payments - could get up to €442.5m plus royalties from Merck. Merck hasn't given any details yet on the phase III trial results, saying it will submit them for presentation at a future medical conference. The company's good news comes after another CMV drug developer - Chimerix - reported that its brincidofovir CMV candidate failed a pair of pivotal trials. Other companies developing CMV-targeting drugs include Atara Biotherapeutics and ViraCyte, which have CMV-specific T-cell therapies in development, while Shire has a small-molecule drug called maribavir heading into phase III testing that it acquired along with ViroPharma in 2013. Meanwhile, Sanofi, GlaxoSmithKline/AlphaVax, Astellas, Helocyte, Vical and VBI Vaccines have preventive vaccines against the virus in clinical testing. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments.

The company said the Keytruda was superior compared to investigator choice chemotherapy. Based on a pre-specified interim analysis, an independent Data Monitoring Committee has recommended that the trial be stopped early. The safety profile of Keytruda was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies involving patients with advanced urothelial cancer. According to Merck, the Keytruda clinical development program includes more than 30 tumor types in more than 360 clinical trials, including nearly 200 trials that combine Keytruda with other cancer treatments. Keynote -045 is a randomized, pivotal, phase 3 study evaluating as a monotherapy compared to investigator-choice chemotherapy.

Mark Warren national frontiers Science Date of Publication: 10.19.16. 10.19.16 Time of Publication: 6:55 am. 6:55 am The Cure for Cancer Is Data—Mountains of Data Lola Dupre A few years ago Eric Schadt met a woman who had cancer. It was an aggressive form of colon cancer that had come on quickly and metastasized to her liver. She was a young war widow from Mississippi, the mother of two girls she was raising alone, and she had only the health care that her husband’s death benefits afforded her—an overburdened oncologist at a military hospital, the lowest rung on the health care ladder. The polar opposite of cutting-edge medicine. To walk into such a facility with stage 4 metastatic disease is to walk back in time to the world of the unmapped human genome, when “colon cancer” was understood to have a single cause instead of millions of causes resulting in unique variations, when treatment was the same bag of poison, whether you were in Ocean Springs, Mississippi, or Timbuktu. A time without big data, machine learning, or hope. Schadt had just started the Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology at Mount Sinai Hospital, and when he heard about the woman in Mississippi, he said, simply, “That’s exactly the kind of patient we take.” By that he meant patients for whom the current standard of care would fail, for whom the future of medicine—one in which supercomputers sift through masses of genetic data for patterns that could lead to new treatments and cures—could not arrive fast enough. Related Stories Matt Simon Genes Might Be Helping the Tasmanian Devil Fight Off Face Cancer Emma Grey Ellis and Nick Stockton You Need More Than Rat Tumors to Prove Phones Cause Cancer Gabriel Popkin The Mystery of How Cancer Cells Barrel Through Your Body Schadt isn’t a cancer specialist or even a medical doctor. He’s a mathematician and a specialist in molecular and computational biology, and he had never had a single patient in his life. Yet through his new lab at Sinai, Schadt would generate a terabyte of data on this woman’s cancer, thousands of times what she could have expected in a conventional medical setting, in the hope of finding new ways to combat it. Toward the end, Schadt would sit at her bedside, distraught. They had become close, and the scientist who had never had patients before was seeing the implications of scientific ambition and failure. She died last year. Seated at his desk at Mount Sinai, Schadt is direct and disarming. At 51, he wears a short-sleeved polo shirt and shorts everywhere he goes, even to black-tie galas or in New York winters, which gives him the unassailable air of a true eccentric, or a high-school football coach. For any medical researcher, it’s easier to be bullish when you’re publishing papers or developing drugs, layers removed from the human impact of your work. But living the effect of your work and watching someone slowly die in front of you, well, “that’s a deeper humbling than I’d ever experienced before,” Schadt says today. “We’re on this exponential growth curve, where your mind naturally projects all the way into the future, and you think: We’re going to figure this out,” he says. “In the end, we will know what all these cells are doing, what all these perturbations do. The humbling part is that as we are on this growth curve, we are continually struck by the increasing complexity that is revealed.” For a decade we’ve been talking about the potential of gene sequencing and personalized medicine, how advances in computer processing power combined with an increasingly intimate understanding of our individual genomes has put us on the threshold of an age of miracles. With enough data, the theory goes, there’s not a disease that isn’t druggable. But as Schadt has learned, it’s not enough to plumb the depths of an individual’s DNA. It requires a universe of data—exabytes worth—to detect patterns in a population, apply machine learning, find the network of mutations responsible for disease, and do something about it. The bigger these data sets become, the more accurate and powerful the models and the predictors become. You must convince the medical centers and genetic companies that collect our data to not hoard it for their own profit. The problem is getting these exabytes of genetic data. Turns out you can’t just walk up to people, millions of them, and say, “Your data, please.” You must first persuade them that you’ll only do good things with it and won’t let it fall into the wrong hands. (We do like our privacy.) You must then convince the medical centers and genetic companies that collect this data that, rather than hoard it for their own profit, they should share it so the entire research community can attain the economies of scale—the critical mass of data, individual sets eventually numbering in the millions—that Schadt and many others believe is necessary to understand the causes of diseases and engineer new treatments and cures. Right now, that volume of information is simply not available. But companies ranging from tech behemoths to biomedical startups are racing to solve these issues of scale. And Schadt wants in. If human biological complexity can be likened to an animated movie, then a hundred years ago we had about one pixel’s worth of understanding of that complexity. With a single pixel, you have no idea what the story is. But with more pixels, hundreds or thousands—or say, 1 percent of the whole in pixels—patterns and themes begin to emerge. The beginning of a narrative. This was the thinking that compelled Schadt to set up the Icahn Institute in 2011 after a decade of developing drugs for Merck. (At one point, half of Merck’s metabolic drugs, which treat ailments like heart disease, diabetes, and obesity, were derived from Schadt’s research.) In the face of widely held assumptions based on the single-gene model of disease and drug development, he came to believe that genes worked not alone but in vast networks to enable disease to penetrate our natural defenses, and we could understand these networks only through deep bioinformatic spelunking. To explore his complexity model, Schadt arrived at Mount Sinai with $150 million of financier–philanthropist Carl Icahn’s money and built a supercomputer named Minerva in the basement to analyze the thousands of genomes collected at Mount Sinai each year. He hired other quants, including Jeffrey Hammerbacher, who had created Facebook’s first-ever data team. According to an esteemed oncologist at the medical school, “All of a sudden you had all these math nerds running around, people who looked like they should be programming videogames.” “We need 100 Mount Sinais to achieve the scale required to recognize the patterns in patient data that guide you to diagnoses and treatments.” It didn’t take long for Schadt to realize that he was going to need a bigger boat. In 2014 the Icahn Institute started a joint venture with Sage Bionetworks to try to cure rare childhood diseases—cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, Tay-Sachs—170 in all. They called it the Resilience Project, and researchers set out to find individuals in the population who carried the DNA variants for those diseases but somehow, through some inoculating buffer, didn’t have the disease. In their search for these “resilient individuals,” Schadt and his team amassed a pool of genetic data from 600,000 people, then the largest such genetic study ever conducted, with data assembled from a dozen sources (23andMe, the Beijing Genomics Institute, and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, most notably). But in searching the 600,000 genomes, the researchers found potentially resilient individuals for only eight of the 170 diseases they were targeting. The study size was too small. By calculating the frequency of the disease-causing mutations in the population, Schadt and his team came to believe that the number of subjects they’d need to be useful wasn’t 600,000—it was more on the order of 10 million. For all the computational power behind the Resilience Project and what seemed like a wealth of data, Schadt still lacked the quantity and quality of patient information required to crack the genetic code behind resilience. “We need 100 Mount Sinais to achieve the scale required to recognize the patterns in patient data that guide you to diagnoses and treatments,” Schadt says. “In the five years that I’ve been here, I’ve realized that’s just not going to happen within the medical centers. They’re too isolated from each other, too competitive, and they’re not woven together into a coherent framework that enables the kind of advancements we’re seeing in nearly all other industries.” Since the major medical centers hold an effective monopoly over their patients’ data and have little economic incentive to collaborate with one another in critical research areas, Schadt says, “the disruption is gonna happen outside the medical establishment.” So that’s what Schadt is aiming to build by establishing his own genetic data company, Sema4. The New York–based venture will focus on acquiring and expanding companies that specialize in genetic testing—–think cancer-carrier screenings and noninvasive prenatal tests—in order to collect and share millions of individual data sets. On Sema4’s searchable platform, doctors will have instant access to a world of genomes to help diagnose their patients. Pharmaceutical companies will pay to use the system to find patient populations for clinical trials. And scientists, their current analytic arsenals amplified through ever more powerful computers and machine-learning algorithms, will finally possess enough genetic data to fuel ambitious research. Though a handful of tech giants are venturing into the life sciences (see “Big Bets on Biodata,” below) and the National Institutes of Health is asking for a million volunteers to create its own massive biobank, Schadt believes that Sema4 and other startups like it—Craig Venter’s Human Longevity and Patrick Soon-Shiong’s Nant-Health chief among them—are the most committed to achieving the optimal scale of genetic data. While these companies will compete with one another to collect ever greater stores of high–quality biodata, Sema4 will stand out by making its genetic library accessible and free of charge to academic medical centers and nonprofit researchers around the world. Should any of Sema4’s competitors need to harvest information from a subset of Schadt’s data populations, he says, they could simply pay to access the Sema4 search platform. Or Sema4 and other companies could join forces to assemble large data sets for ambitious endeavors like the Resilience Project—only bigger. Big Bets on Biodata How four tech heavyweights are going all-in on life science. —Gregory Barber Alphabet Using machine learning for their Baseline study, Alphabet’s Verily Life Sciences team will pore over genomic, clinical, and imaging data from thousands of healthy volunteers in the hope of better understanding what makes them healthy—knowledge that might help keep people from getting sick in the first place. IBM In the 1970s, the World Health Organization used IBM hardware to hunt down the last vestiges of smallpox. Today IBM is partnering with hospitals to funnel health data into Watson, its Jeopardy!-winning AI system. The goal is to predict disease, personalize treatment, and even power virtual medical assistants to sift through records and research. Apple Using Apple’s ResearchKit, scientists can recruit clinical study subjects en masse and collect real-time health data from participants’ iPhones. Last spring the company added CareKit, which lets Apple users share health data directly with their personal doctors. Microsoft The company is developing tiny sensors to be worn on the skin that can transmit biometric data to remote health monitors (and, potentially, large-scale data aggregators). Microsoft also just announced its plan to use machine learning and biological data to “solve” cancer. Still, Schadt argues, the problem of scale can’t be solved by companies simply pooling their data. “It’s about getting the data from the patients themselves.” Based on his experience at Mount Sinai, he’s seen a leap in recent years in the number of people who are coming around to his belief that there is more upside than down to having a physician know their genetic predisposition to certain conditions. He says that when he got to Mount Sinai in 2011, the hospital was screening a few thousand genetic samples a year. This year, they could screen up to 150,000, most of them collected from patients in the New York region, and at Sema4, Schadt says, “we intend to scale that up to 500,000 to a million samples a year.” That growth will occur by buying and expanding existing genetic testing companies all over the country, most of which are now independent from each other but under Sema4 will combine to create a massive network of genetic information governed by a uniform standard of security and consent. Schadt acknowledges that it’s no simple task to ask a person to give up their biodata to an anonymous corporation. Even though billions of public- and private-sector dollars have been spent to modernize and secure existing data networks, breaches and leaks remain a fact of life. At Sema4, patients will be told, in detail, how their data will be encrypted, anonymized, and scrubbed of identifying information (except for an encryption key). Even in the event of a breach, the chance of someone being identified and exposed is exceedingly low. There is also the issue of informed consent—the patients’ understanding and approval of the whats, hows, whys, and how longs of whatever they’re asked to endure—which impacts both the quality and the quantity of the data being collected. “There are companies today that claim access to millions of patient records,” Schadt explains. “But from the standpoint of what we intend to do, the data is meaningless. It’s often inaccurate, incomplete, and not easily linked across systems. Plus, that data doesn’t typically include access to DNA or to the genomic data generated on their DNA.” To take the example of the Resilience Project, it wasn’t simply that the universe of data was too small—it was also that the 600,000 genomes were governed under a hash of various consenting arrangements. If something vital was discovered, hundreds of thousands of participants could not be recontacted or tracked, making the data useless from a practical research standpoint. Today, most consent forms are designed to be as quick and uninformative as possible, but rather than make it easier for researchers to get high-quality data, this approach actually makes it harder. Studies have shown that the more informed the consent, the better the information, since patients are more willing to participate in follow-up exams and interviews when they appreciate the purpose of the research. (This also allows scientists to track health and wellness over time.) At Sema4, Schadt is adopting a multistage informational process—which includes a mandatory, must-pass quiz—so it will be clear that patients understand the full scope of what they’re consenting to. This will require more of a patient’s time, but Schadt is betting that as more patients understand, more of them will consent to sharing their genetic information. With this digital infrastructure in place, Schadt envisions a future in which more and more patients share not only their genomes but also medical and lifestyle information collected by monitoring devices like glucometers, blood-pressure trackers, and inhalers. The hope is that, ultimately, these increasingly sophisticated, increasingly patient-friendly tests will be so comprehensive that a patient’s microbiome can be regularly sequenced, their RNA frequently examined, and their blood cells constantly monitored for signs of trouble. The virtual monopoly that medical centers like Mount Sinai now exercise over patient data will be smashed, and researchers will finally have the masses of genetic data that the medical breakthroughs of the future require. “Can we do better for human well-being if information is more broadly accessible, where you’re leveraging the mindshare of the entire planet to evolve the models of disease?” Schadt asks. “Absolutely.” This is medicine as math, not guesswork, and every disease—even stage 4 cancer—might one day be druggable.

The government on Wednesday quickly adopted a recommendation that preteens get two shots instead of three and space them further apart. Health officials hope that will boost the number of girls and boys who get vaccinated. "It will be simpler now for parents to get their kids the HPV vaccine series, and protect their kids from HPV cancers," said Dr. Nancy Messonnier of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The vaccine protects against human papillomavirus — or HPV — which can cause cervical cancer, certain other cancers and genital warts. It is commonly spread through sex and, in most cases, the virus doesn't cause any problems. But some infections gradually lead to cancer. Health officials want kids to get HPV vaccinations at age 11 or 12, well before most first have sex and before they could be infected. But less than one-third of 13-year-old U.S. boys and girls have gotten three doses. Busy parents have struggled with the old schedule, which called for three trips to the doctor within six months. "I know people who say 'I can't do that. Why even start?'" said Cynthia Pellegrini, a March of Dimes official who sits on the panel. Recent studies have shown two doses of the current HPV vaccine — Gardasil 9 — work just as well in kids ages 9 to 14. The Food and Drug Administration two weeks ago said it could be given in two doses. What's more, two doses apparently work better when spaced six to 12 months apart. That means they could be given at annual checkups. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices made the recommendation at a meeting in Atlanta. The panel stuck with three doses for anyone who doesn't get their first shot until they turn 15. That's because they didn't have enough data on how well two doses worked in older kids. The vaccine was first recommended in 2006 for girls, and then for boys in 2011 — partly to reduce the spread of HPV to girls. Vaccination rates have risen very slowly, and health officials have lamented the underuse of a potent cancer prevention tool. Too many doctors have been timid about promoting the shots, experts say. That's at least partly because some parents have worried the vaccination seems like they are greenlighting their kids to have sex. But the onerous schedule sure didn't help. "I think it was the icing on the cake" for parents already hesitant about HPV shots, said Dr. William Schaffner, a vaccines expert at Vanderbilt University. Until recently, there were three HPV vaccines on the market. Now there's only one — Merck & Co.'s Gardasil 9. This month, the company stopped selling an older version. GlaxoSmithKline phased out its vaccine, Cervarix, in the U.S. because of poor sales.

The CDC previously recommended three doses of Gardasil, which is the only vaccine in the United States that is currently licensed to prevent the human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV can cause some cancers such as cervical cancer, throat cancer, and mouth cancer. Government officials say that the change came after studies showed that two doses protected recipients for “decades,” NBC News reports. They said that earlier studies had only been performed on children who received three doses of the vaccine, so researchers had not realized that two vaccinations might be sufficient. They also reported that they found that the vaccine was at least as effective in preventing HPV if the doses were a year apart, and perhaps even more effective. Previous recommendations had been that children should receive the second shot one to two months after the first, and the third shot six months after that. The two original HPV vaccines offered in the United States protected against either two or four of the strains of HPV that have been linked to some cancers. Now the only vaccine available in the U.S. is Merck’s Gardasil 9, which claims to protect against nine strains of HPV. Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC, said that researchers still don’t know how many doses of older HPV vaccines are needed, so they are still recommending three doses for kids who were vaccinated with earlier versions of the HPV vaccine. There are over 100 strains of HPV, according to Web MD. About 40 of these strains are sexually transmitted, and about half of all sexually active people will contract at least one strain. Symptoms are typically mild if they are experienced at all, and HPV tends to go away on its own. Some strains of HPV can cause genital warts. These strains are considered “low risk” strains and rarely develop into cancer. The most common of these strains is now included in Gardasil 9. HPV typically clears up on its own. In fact, research has shown that 90 percent of women who contract HPV will show no traces of infection within two years. The CDC recommends that all preteen girls and boys receive the Gardasil vaccine starting at age 11 or 12. One reason is that this is before teens are sexually active. They also recommend vaccination at an earlier age because older teens are less likely to get health checkups than preteens. Despite the CDC recommendations, many Americans continue to have reservations about the HPV vaccine. Merck, maker of MMR and HPV (Gardasil) vaccines has paid over $6 Billion for damage done by Vioxx. #VaxWithMe https://t.co/alKI535npr — Zoey O'Toole (@TMRProf) October 10, 2016 Gardasil Researcher Speaks Out on Dangers of HPV Vaccine #VaccinesKill #CDCWhistlleblower #Vaxxed #CDCFraud https://t.co/UXtiigbpp3 — Richard Healy (@RichardJHealy) October 21, 2016 Clinicians becoming reluctant to recommend HPV vaccine due to reports of serious adverse reactions https://t.co/fmSpYCSAN3 — CMSRI (@CMSRIResearch) October 21, 2016 Some have responded to the new Gardasil recommendation with cynicism, noting that most teens were not getting three doses of the HPV vaccine anyway and pointing out the high cost and health concerns that have been linked to the controversial vaccine. A 2015 study reported in the British Medical Journal found that two doses of HPV vaccination were “likely” to protect against HPV infection for at least 10 years. Researchers determined that three doses probably provided longer protection, but they did not know if it was worth the higher government cost, writing that the risk-benefit ratio was probably best for governments if only two doses were given since the vaccine is so costly for government health programs. Researchers noted that even the WHO has switched to recommending only two doses of the HPV vaccine because of the costs. “The World Health Organization’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) also recommended a two dose schedule for girls aged 9-14 years after reviewing evidence including cost effectiveness modelling.” Gardasil was first approved in the United States in 2006, though it was not approved for boys and young men until 2009. The Atlantic reports that Gardasil is Merck’s top selling vaccine, bringing in $1.4 billion in annual sales.

HPV vaccines Pre-teens need only two HPV shots, not three, CDC recommends Cervarix vaccine is highly effective at protecting against the two most common cervical cancer causing HPV types. Photo: Golinharris Two doses of a vaccine that protects against cervical and several other types of cancer are enough for 11-to 12-year-olds, rather than the previous three-shot regimen, the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday. Vaccines against the human papillomavirus, or HPV, Merck & Co Inc's Gardasil and GlaxoSmithKline Plc's Cervarix, have been available for years, but acceptance by the public has been slow. "Safe, effective, and long-lasting protection against HPV cancers with two visits instead of three means more Americans will be protected from cancer," CDC Director Tom Frieden said in a statement. "This recommendation will make it simpler for parents to get their children protected in time." The CDC now recommends that 11- to 12-year-olds receive two doses of HPV vaccine at least six months apart. Adolescents aged 13 and 14 can also receive the two-dose schedule, but teens and young adults who start the series later, at ages 15 through 26 years, will continue to need three doses, the agency said. HPV is among the most common sexually transmitted diseases. Most infections do not cause symptoms and go away on their own, but the virus is still a leading cause of cancer deaths among women worldwide. Since the virus can also cause genital warts and cancers of the anus and mouth/throat, the vaccine is recommended for both sexes. In the United States, the HPV vaccine is recommended for children aged 11 or 12, with the goal of protecting them against the virus before they become sexually active, and also for teens and young adults who may not have previously been vaccinated.

The mechanism, which so far has British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline signed up to provide its pneumonia vaccine at the lowest possible price, will ask other major pharmaceutical firms including Pfizer and Merck to make similar cut-price agreements for emergencies only. "The idea is that this will set a model in place for other manufacturers to put their vaccines on the table," said Greg Elder, a medical coordinator with the international charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) which joined talks on the issue at the WHO's Geneva headquarters last week. More on this... FDA expands use of Pfizer's best-selling pneumonia vaccine UNICEF clinches vaccine deal to protect children from five diseases Congo, Angola begin mass vaccination drive against yellow fever A spokesman for the WHO said the humanitarian vaccine mechanism - which would only be used in crisis situations - could mean reaching millions of vulnerable people with protective shots against potential killers such as measles, yellow fever and pneumonia. For now, GSK has pledged to make its PCV-10 vaccine for pneumococcal infection available at its lowest possible price, he said, and other manufacturers are considering which of their shots might also be included. Signing up would mean drugmakers agreeing to supply the shots at a price equivalent to that paid by the United Nations children's fund UNICEF for vaccines supplied under the GAVI Vaccines Alliance to low and middle-income countries who can't afford to pay full price. Yet unlike GAVI, the cheaper emergency vaccines would be accessible only to non-governmental organizations such as MSF and other charities and humanitarian groups - not to health ministries or national authorities. This, said MSF's Elder, will ensure drugmakers are not exposed to having to supply large quantities of vaccines at rock-bottom prices that could dent their profits. "We're talking about a very specific cohort - refugees, displaced populations, people who have gone through a lot of trauma and have had to flee their homes," Elder said. "It's a small group of people who are caught in the middle of emergencies and can fall through the gaps. And it's a minute fraction of their (the drug companies') global market." The International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA) and the Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers Network (DCVMN), who took part in the talks "expressed great interest" and said they would take the idea to their members, according to Noni MacDonald, an immunization specialist and professor of pediatrics at Canada's Dalhousie Medical School, who chaired the meeting. Philippe Duclos, a senior WHO expert on immunization, said the hope is that the mechanism will ultimately cover some 23 shots against diseases ranging from cholera to rabies to polio to hepatitis to yellow fever. "Of course some vaccines are more important in certain emergencies than in others," he said. "What we need is to rationalize, quickly, in each emergency, which ones are needed." MacDonald said that while there is a way to go to agree prices and supplies, she is confident that starting with GSK's pneumococcal shot will show how the system can work for others. "It's rare to have such disparate groups come together so solidly to support the way forward," she told Reuters. "It's going to take a lot of effort and education to make this process work, but we're all agreed it's important - and failure to deliver is not an option because lives depend upon getting this done right."

Debiopharm International SA Announces Clinical Collaboration with the Merck-Pfizer Alliance in Cancer Immunotherapy Debiopharm International SA Announces Clinical Collaboration with the Merck-Pfizer Alliance in Cancer Immunotherapy PR NEWSWIRE Tweet Condividi su WhatsApp Pubblicato il: 20/10/2016 14:01 LAUSANNE, Switzerland, October 20, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- This joint effort will initially focus on aPhase I/Ib trialin patients withLung Cancerto assess safety and preliminary efficacyofDebio 1143 in combination with avelumab  Debiopharm International (Debiopharm - http://www.debiopharm.com) today announced that it has entered into a collaboration agreement with Merck and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) to evaluate Debio 1143, an oral, small molecule inhibitor of IAPs (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins), in combination with avelumab, an investigational fully human anti-PD-L1 IgG1 monoclonal antibody, in patients with advanced or metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Debio 1143 is currently in Phase II development for Head & Neck and Ovarian Cancer. Avelumab is under clinical investigation across a broad range of tumor types by the Merck-Pfizer Alliance. Under the terms of the agreement, Debiopharm will be responsible for conducting the Phase I/Ib clinical trial in NSCLC. "We are delighted to initiate this collaboration in immuno-oncology with the Merck-Pfizer Alliance. It is a great opportunity to explore in the clinic the immunomodulatory properties of Debio 1143 observed in preclinical studies," said Dr Chris Freitag, Vice President, Clinical Research & Development, Debiopharm International SA. "We are hopeful that the immunosensitizing effect of our compound in combination with avelumab may translate into a potentially better treatment outcome for patients suffering from this major debilitating disease." Globally, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women, responsible for more deaths than colon, breast and prostate cancer combined. [ 1 ] NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for 80-85% of all lung cancers. [ 2 ] The 5-year survival rate for people diagnosed with late-stage lung cancer that has spread (metastasized) to other areas of the body is 4%. [ 3 ] "Inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has shown promising activity in patients with advanced NSCLC," said Alise Reicin, M.D., Head of Global Clinical Development in the biopharma business of Merck. "We hope that our exploration of avelumab as a combination therapy with Debio 1143 will generate results that could potentially one day make a real difference to patients fighting this deadly cancer." "Investigating the potential of combination therapy is an important strategic focus for the Merck-Pfizer Alliance," said Chris Boshoff, M.D., Ph.D., Head of Immuno-Oncology, Early Development, and Translational Oncology at Pfizer. "This collaboration with Debiopharm provides a significant opportunity to explore the potential synergistic effects of these two agents in combination." AboutDebio 1143  Debio 1143 is an oral, small molecule inhibitor of IAPs (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins) that promotes apoptosis of cancer cells by mimicking the activity of the natural Second Mitochondrial-derived Activator of Caspases (SMAC). Evasion of apoptosis is a hallmark of cancer and a common mechanism of resistance to current treatments and Debio 1143 is being investigated as chemo- and radio-sensitizer in Ovarian Cancer and Head & Neck Cancer. In addition, like other members of the class, Debio 1143 displays strong immunomodulatory properties that make it a natural candidate for combination with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors. About Avelumab  Avelumab (also known as MSB0010718C) is an investigational, fully human antibody specific for a protein found on tumor cells called PD-L1, or programmed death ligand-1. Avelumab is thought to have a dual mechanism of action which may enable the immune system to find and attack cancer cells. By binding to PD-L1, avelumab is thought to prevent tumor cells from using PD-L1 for protection against white blood cells such as T-cells, exposing them to anti-tumor responses. Avelumab is also thought to help white blood cells such as natural killer (NK) cells find and attack tumors in a process known as ADCC, or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In November 2014, Merck, the science and technology company, and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab. About Debiopharm International SA  Debiopharm Group™ is a Swiss-based global biopharmaceutical group of five companies active in the development and manufacture of drugs and diagnostics tools. Debiopharm focuses on developing prescription drugs that target unmet medical needs. The group in-licenses and develops promising drug candidates.

The global 3D cell culture market is segmented based on technology, application, end user, and region. The scaffold-based segment is expected to register the highest growth rate in the 3D cell culture market, by technology, during the forecast period. The high growth in this segment is attributed to the variety of material and structural choices for scaffold, due to which they are most preferred in various applications. Based on end users, the 3D cell culture market is segmented into research laboratories & institutes, biotechnology & pharmaceutical industries, and hospitals & diagnostic centers. The biotechnology & pharmaceutical industries segment is expected to account for the largest share of the market in 2016. Increasing prevalence of cancer cases and the need for development of advanced drugs and therapies will drive the growth of this market. Geographically, the 3D cell culture market is dominated by North America, followed by Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Rest of the World (RoW). Growth in the North American segment is primarily driven by rising incidences of cancer, increasing government support in the form of grants and funding, expanding biopharmaceutical industry, and launch of new products in the market. The major factors contributing to the growth of the 3D cell culture market include increasing incidences of cancer, growing awareness regarding the benefits of 3D cell culture, rising regulatory approvals for cell culture-based vaccines, funding for cell-based research, and technological advancements. On the other hand, high cost of cell biology research and lack of infrastructure for cell-based research in emerging economies are the major factors restraining the growth of this market. The high growth potential in the Asia-Pacific region provides growth opportunities to players in the 3D cell culture market. Apart from comprehensive geographic and product analysis and market sizing, the report also provides a competitive landscape that covers the growth strategies adopted by industry players over the last three years. In addition, the company profiles comprise the product portfolios, developments, and strategies adopted by the market players to maintain and increase their shares in the market.

The global 3D cell culture market is segmented based on technology, application, end user, and region. The scaffold-based segment is expected to register the highest growth rate in the 3D cell culture market, by technology, during the forecast period. The high growth in this segment is attributed to the variety of material and structural choices for scaffold, due to which they are most preferred in various applications. Based on end users, the 3D cell culture market is segmented into research laboratories & institutes, biotechnology & pharmaceutical industries, and hospitals & diagnostic centers. The biotechnology & pharmaceutical industries segment is expected to account for the largest share of the market in 2016. Increasing prevalence of cancer cases and the need for development of advanced drugs and therapies will drive the growth of this market. Geographically, the 3D cell culture market is dominated by North America, followed by Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Rest of the World (RoW). Growth in the North American segment is primarily driven by rising incidences of cancer, increasing government support in the form of grants and funding, expanding biopharmaceutical industry, and launch of new products in the market. The major factors contributing to the growth of the 3D cell culture market include increasing incidences of cancer, growing awareness regarding the benefits of 3D cell culture, rising regulatory approvals for cell culture-based vaccines, funding for cell-based research, and technological advancements. On the other hand, high cost of cell biology research and lack of infrastructure for cell-based research in emerging economies are the major factors restraining the growth of this market. The high growth potential in the Asia-Pacific region provides growth opportunities to players in the 3D cell culture market.

New Jersey Jewish News Home News Statewide World Greater MetroWest Middlesex/Monmouth Princeton Mercer Bucks Community About Free E-Newsletter Advertise Subscribe Contact Us Classifieds Home > Greater MetroWest News Healthcare Foundation makes up agencies’ shortfalls Federation groups get grants for special needs, counseling, seniors Share | + enlarge image Marsha Atkind, executive director/CEO of the Healthcare Foundation of NJ, said, “Federation funding for many of its agencies has declined substantially in recent years, but the populations they are serving have not decreased.” + more images Advertisements by Robert Wiener NJJN Staff Writer October 20, 2016 Three social service agencies funded by the Jewish Federation of Greater MetroWest NJ have been awarded grants by the Healthcare Foundation of New Jersey — in part to make up for lost allocations from the federation. The foundation was set up in 1996 with the proceeds from the sale of Newark Beth Israel Medical Center to the Saint Barnabas Healthcare System. Since then it has used its funds to bolster the health-care needs of vulnerable populations in and outside the Jewish community. The largest recipient of the grants was the Jewish Vocational Service of MetroWest NJ, which was awarded of $117,125 to help transform its sheltered workshop for people with special needs into a program to integrate those clients into mainstream workplaces. It is now in the second year of a two-year grant. The JVS lost $147,840 of its federation funding last year, and another $91,399 from New Jersey’s Division of Vocational Rehabilitation Services, said executive director Addy Bonet. The cuts forced JVS to drop 12 of the 84 slots for workshop clients. “We were required to get additional funding because we don’t want to have our clients fall through the cracks,” she told NJJN in an Oct. 11 phone interview. Marsha Atkind, executive director and CEO of the foundation, said that “thinking has changed” about the role of sheltered workshops, in which people are paid below minimum wage for such routine work as stuffing envelopes and putting products into boxes. She said there is now “a new emphasis” on training capable clients for better-paying jobs in mainstream society. Some of them have been given internships by JVS, paid for by Healthcare Foundation grants. They provide salaries for trainees while JVS counselors work with employers on using these workers most productively. “The hope is that if JVS clients work out, employers will hire them and take over payment of their salaries,” Atkind said. Said Bonet, “Without the support from the Healthcare Foundation we would not be able to move forward in the transformation process, and people would be left without services.” The Jewish Family Service of MetroWest is another agency that sustained a cut in its allocation from the GMW federation. It received $475,000 in funds from the federation for fiscal year 2017; in fiscal year 2016 its allocation was $477,928. JFS turned to the Healthcare Foundation for a grant of $62,600 to train its counselors in mindfulness techniques. JFS executive director Reuben Rotman defined mindfulness as “a body of practices that help an individual to find ways to reduce stress and anxiety and to respond to changes in one’s life in as calm and rational a way as possible.” The program will begin in January and will incorporate yoga, meditation, and breathing techniques. The funding will be used to cover program expenses and the hiring of psychotherapist Beth Sandweiss, who cofounded the Jewish Meditation Center of Montclair and will train JFS counselors in mindfulness. Rotman said the program will be conducted at the agency’s Florham Park office as an adjunct to individual therapy sessions with clients. The targeted participants are adults who are chronically ill or are living in stressful circumstances. The third grant was a $40,000 allocation to Jewish Family Service of Central NJ for “Bringing Health Education Home,” a project that will engage a part-time registered nurse and a social worker who will partner with area synagogues, senior housing, and senior centers to lead health education seminars on heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and nutrition for at-risk seniors. Tom Beck, executive director of the JFS of Central NJ, said the project will cover 50 people with home visits and more than 200 others who attend the agency’s health lectures. “We are taking this program on the road,” said Beck. “It will be delivered as a PowerPoint presentation at senior citizens’ centers, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and synagogues.” Unlike the other two grant recipients, the Central NJ JFS has received increases in its allocations from the federation, as well as another $25,000 for the program from the Merck Company Foundation. Its allocation rose by 10 percent to $250,000 for the current fiscal year. “We have always funded health programs in the Jewish community that the agencies couldn’t cover with their funding from the federation,” Atkind said. “I’m not saying the reason we give these agencies these grants is because their budgets have been cut; but their budgets have been cut substantially, and in the last few years they are all having a greater emphasis on fund-raising. “The agencies come to us for things they need that they can’t fund from their core allocations,” she said. “Health is not a priority of the federation — and I’m not saying that it should be. The federation has to make its own decisions about what the priorities should be. “But health is our priority,” said Atkind, “and we want to help the agencies with things we think will help the health and well-being of the Jewish community.”   Share | You might also like: Healthcare Foundation honors humanists New board chair at Healthcare Foundation Healthcare Foundation grants aid to veterans Healthcare ‘hero’ served on two fronts Back to top Reader Discussion Leave a Comment Your Name Your Email (never published) Comment New Jersey Jewish News welcomes your comments.
