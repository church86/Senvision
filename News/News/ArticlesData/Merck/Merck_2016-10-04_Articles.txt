The draft recommendation by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) applies to the treatment of advanced NSCLC whose tumours express PD-L1 and who have received at least one prior treatment with chemotherapy or a targeted anticancer regimen. The initial consultation document notes that despite a discount on Keytruda's £1,315 per 2mg/kg dose price tag and ability to extend lives, its use would likely see costs overshoot the range typically considered acceptable for routine NHS use. A major point of contention is the likely duration of treatment with Keytruda. Merck's modelling assumes patients will stop using pembrolizumab after two years if their disease has not worsened, while NICE believes that in practice it is unlikely that patients benefiting from treatment will stop taking it. Bristol-Myers Squibb's rival PD-1 inhibitor Opdivo (nivolumab) was given equally short shrift in lung cancer in draft guidance published by NICE in May. Despite evidence that the drug could extend overall survival than standard treatment with docetaxel - with fewer side effects - the agency said it was too expensive. The decision has been greeted with dismay by Merck (which operates as MSD in Europe). The company's UK managing director, Louise Houson, said the company was working with both NICE and NHS England "to ensure we can find a solution to get back on track". She said it was imperative that the "much needed treatment option is made available to people with previously treated advanced NSCLC as quickly as possible. This is particularly important as these patients have a very poor prognosis, with limited time". NICE has been taking an increasingly tough stance on cancer drug pricing, holding out for steep discounts in order to reduce the NHS' spending on medicines. The agency will be collecting comments on its assessment until 24 October. According to data from 2012, around 45,000 people in the UK are diagnosed with lung cancer each year, and survival rates lag behind those of some other European countries. Around 80% of those diagnosed with advanced disease die within a year. Keytruda was the first drug to be made available under the UK's Early Access to Medicines Scheme (EAMS) and has been made available at no cost to over 140 previously treated advanced NSCLC patients to date, said Merck. This initial recommendation will not affect patients currently receiving treatment, regardless of the funding arrangements in place for them, unless a clinical decision is taken to stop. New patients do not have access at this time and future access will depend on NICE's final guidance. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments.

CPhI announced the awards at the organization's annual awards gala on Oct. 4 in Barcelona, Spain.

Both products help to improve key steps of assisted reproductive treatment (ART) - an area where laboratory technologies play a vital role for treatment success. The launches represent the seventh and eighth product launch in 18 months for the Fertility Technologies unit at Merck, demonstrating the company's healthcare strategy to deliver innovation through best-in class assets. Gavi' enables clinics to preserve human egg cells, also called oocytes, and embryos at the main stages of ART, while Geri' medium supports undisturbed cultivation of embryos. "Undergoing fertility treatment means looking at a lot of individual variables to ensure that everything is done for a successful outcome. During this process, couples want to be assured that their healthcare providers have the right tools at hand to assess those variables and help them make their dream of having a baby become a reality," said Rehan Verjee, Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer at Merck's biopharma business. "With our two new products, we provide laboratories with important instruments that support fertility treatment tailored to the clinic and to the individual needs of patients." Preserving oocytes or embryos for future in vitro fertilization and embryo transfers by cooling them to deep sub-zero degrees is a key step in the laboratory. Gavi' is the world's first automated instrument for this preservation technique, also called vitrification. With its latest product innovation, Gavi' provides clinicians with added flexibility when taking important treatment decisions with and for their patients. Geri' medium was developed to help improve another critical factor for successful treatment, embryo cultivation. After fertilization, the embryo needs to grow and develop before it is transferred into a woman's womb. With the single-step culture medium, Merck now provides a way to support undisturbed incubation and optimal embryo development. Both products, developed and manufactured by Australian fertility technologies company, Genea Biomedx, will be available in Europe, with Gavi' also launching in Canada and additional regions to follow soon. They are commercialized as part of the partnership between Merck and Genea Biomedx that started in 2015. About Gavi', Geri' and Gems' Gavi' is the world's first automated vitrification instrument, developed with the aim to achieve a consistent and standardized vitrification process. Geri' is a benchtop incubator with individually controlled incubation chambers per patient to minimize disruptive events to the early-stage embryo. It also incorporates a time-lapse camera to capture images of embryos as they develop. Gems' is the latest generation of Genea Biomedx's culture media suite for high-quality embryo cultivation. Gavi', Geri' and Gems' received the CE mark clearance in Europe, and also the consumables for Gavi' and Geri' are certified. The three devices are not yet cleared for use in the USA. GaviTM, GeriTM and GemsTM are created by Genea Biomedx. All Merck Press Releases are distributed by e-mail at the same time they become available on the Merck Website.

Partnering activity is at a record high, with 60% more requests already compared to any previous year and 50% more meetings scheduled. The system is easier to use than ever. It includes a mobile app, integration with Outlook, Gmail or other calendars, and the ability to browse and schedule sessions and company presentations. BIO’s partnering system is built atop the Partneringplace CRM for pharma business development. That means a history of the companies you met at previous BIO events is at your fingertips. With rich task assignment and comment threads, you also can collaborate with colleagues who may not be coming to BIO Investor Forum for feedback and insights on companies. If you’d like to collaborate on your meeting strategy at BIO Investor Forum with a colleague who’s not attending, just send us their information at biopartnering@bio.org and we will add them in to Partneringplace! Finally Partneringplace makes meeting follow-up and note taking a breeze, and it’s free to use for BIO conferences. Be sure to click on Partneringplace in the BIO One-on-One Partnering menu to check it out. To help companies at the 2,000+ partnering meetings that will transpire at BIO Investor Forum, BIO hosted a webinar and asked Rajeev Dadoo (RD) from SR One, Karl Handelsman (KH) from Codon Capital and the Roche Venture Fund, Alex Szidon (AS) from Merck (West Coast Innovation Hub) and Ed Hurwitz (EH) from Precision BioVentures to give advice on how to make the most of partnering meetings. If you missed our mega web panel on how to pitch to investors and inlicensors, you should check out the recording: go.bio.org/BIF16Webinar.html. Here are some transcribed pieces of wisdom: How do you make the ideal pitch deck? “Don’t fall in love with your particular agent or delivery device. Fall in love with the solution to a problem and if you can connect an unmet need with a particular mechanism and show that you can connect the dots…if you can explain problem, solution, and attractability – that checks all boxes” - Alex Szidon, Merck (West Coast Innovation Hub) “Going back to the real basics you should know your audience and tailor the presentation. You need to be flexible so the discussion can change as it goes on if somebody gets interested in one particular point or topic.” - Rajeev Dadoo, SR One “Lead off with what makes you interesting to the group – tell me why you have a solution that is compelling” - Karl Handelsman, Codon Capital and the Roche Venture Fund “The only thing that will lose my interest immediately and never get a follow-up is if we never talk about mechanism of action.” - Ed Hurwitz, Precision BioVentures How much data do you need to have before seeking investment or outlicensing? “We like to see some biological/scientific rational around the target pathway mechanism. Why it might be different than current standard of care (if there is one). And why it might be differentiated – you might not have all the data, but at least a strong hypothesis.” - Rajeev Dadoo, SR One “What makes a poor impression is qualitative statements around ‘it’s a clean profile, there’s no tox.’ That just means you haven’t done the right experiments – it erodes the credibility of the team.” - Alex Szidon, Merck (West Coast Innovation Hub) “You should engage both with collaborators and investors even before you start the company and you’ll have a much higher success rate…learn what’s going on.” - Karl Handelsman, Codon Capital and the Roche Venture Fund “In general I would never do anything before your provisional patents at a minimum are filed and the IP is solidified. You need some expert advice on the IP side, always, before you would launch.” - Ed Hurwitz, Precision BioVentures How do you handle confidential information before CDA? “I would err on the side of not showing structures to people until very very very late and in some cases after you see some preliminary economic terms.” - Ed Hurwitz, Precision BioVentures “What moves us is data and so if there’s an impediment between those critical data and a company’s ability to share them, they need to remove them” - Alex Szidon, Merck (West Coast Innovation Hub) “It is a skill to be able to talk about what it is you’re doing without revealing the parts that make it confidential. You can talk a lot about what are the advantages, why it is that you have this thing – you can talk about a lot without giving the structure on even under CDA” - Karl Handelsman, Codon Capital and the Roche Venture Fund Use the tips from the webinar to wow potential partners at the BIO Investor Forum, BIO Latin America, the Sofinnova Japan Biopharma Partnering Conference, MedStartUp or any of the various conferences run by the BIO One-on-One Partnering system.

By Carina Storrs, Special to CNN Updated 12:29 AM ET, Wed October 5, 2016 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. JUST WATCHED Is this the cure to cancer? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Is this the cure to cancer? 03:28 Story highlights A new study projects that $3 billion worth of the most common cancer medicines will go to waste this year in the U.S. Drugs are wasted because manufacturers sell them in vials that are not practical to reuse Experts urge policies requiring pharmaceutical companies to package drugs differently or buy back unused drugs (CNN)Most shoppers wouldn't buy a gallon of milk if they thought they could only drink a pint's worth. So why are hospitals and clinics buying larger amounts of cancer therapies than they can use, forcing them to throw these expensive drugs in the trash? The answer, according to a new study, is that many of the top cancer drugs in the United States are only available in single-dose vials, and often that dose is more than the average patient needs. The result is an estimated $3 billion in overspending in the health care system each year, a cost that gets passed on to taxpayers and patients. In one of the more egregious examples, the pharmaceutical company Merck sells a melanoma drug, pembrolizumab, called Keytruda, in vials that contain 100 milligrams of the drug. A 150-pound patient gets about 140 milligrams of Keytruda, meaning that more than half of the second vial would not be used. Although some of the leftover drug might go to another patient, the study determined that on average, 21% of the drug, costing about $200 million, goes to waste. Big Pharma's big donations in 2016 presidential race The problem with Keytruda tipped researchers off to look at the amount of waste among the 20 most common drugs used to treat a range of cancers, including breast, prostate, skin and colorectal. Waste was rampant. "I don't think we thought we'd find multiple drugs with double-digit percentage of the vials wasted, and that is what we found," said Dr. Peter B. Bach, director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Bach is the lead author of the study, which was published on Tuesday in The BMJ journal. Read More There was a large spread among the top 20 cancer medicines in how much of a vial is typically thrown out, from 1% up to 37%. The amount of waste was typically lower for medicines that were available in several single-dose vial options containing a range of doses. Sharing vials between patients also reduced waste, but this is generally only practical at hospitals treating large numbers of cancer patients, not at doctor's offices. Pharmaceuticals cheaper abroad because of regulation Bach and his colleagues estimate that the companies producing the top 20 cancer medicines, including Genentech, Takeda and Onyx Pharmaceuticals, will make nearly $2 billion this year just from wasted drops of these most common cancer drugs. And doctors and hospitals will make $1 billion in markup fees from these tossed treatments. Although insurance companies pick up the tab, it ultimately affects the entire population by driving up taxes and insurance premiums. "The fact that we have insurance doesn't mean someone else is paying the bills -- we are paying the bills," Bach said. Will voters help control the cost of prescription drugs? Waste might be especially bad in the United States compared with other countries. Takeda's myeloma drug, bortezomib, called Velcade, is only available in 3.5-milligram vials in the United States, but the average patient only needs 2.5 milligrams. More appropriately sized 1-milligram vials are available in the United Kingdom. In a statement, a Takeda spokeswoman said the company "worked closely with the FDA to establish the Velcade vial size of 3.5 mg to ensure that one vial would provide an adequate amount of the drug for a patient of almost any size." The company does not have plans to introduce additional vial size options to the U.S. market, the email statement said. In another example, Merck stopped selling its 50-milligram vials of Keytruda in the United States last year. These smaller vials had less potential for waste than the 100-milligram vials that replaced them. But in Europe, where agencies can participate in drug pricing decisions, the 50-milligram vial is still available. According to a statement from Merck, "our understanding of dosing in multiple tumor types has improved." The company is now conducting trials of 200-milligram Keytruda vials, which it says would "eliminate wastage." However according to Bach, this strategy would only mean that more wasted medicine is administered to patients instead of thrown away. "Their new plan is to change the dose so all patients get all of the drug," but studies so far do not suggest the higher dose would carry any benefit for patients, Bach said. Bach and his colleagues suggest two possible solutions for reigning in cancer drug waste: Require companies to provide drugs in vials that contain more appropriate doses or require companies to refund the expense of leftover drug. "I think either one is pretty doable," Bach said. "The (Food and Drug Administration) could definitely issue a much more instructive guidance on vial size where they ask companies to take into account this exact issue, and they can do that without an act of Congress. ... Companies know the market and their regulators and will generally respond to that." Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter. The current study is "excellent," said Dr. Daniel A. Goldstein, an adjunct assistant professor of medical oncology at Emory University and senior physician at Rabin Medical Center in Israel. "As the elections are coming upon us and there's increased discussion about the possibility of legislation to try to impact the pricing mechanism of cancer drugs, this paper is telling us one piece of legislation is to ensure drug companies are forced to provide multiple different options of vial sizes," Goldstein said. Referring to the milk analogy, Goldstein said that drugs should give you the option to buy them in the pint and gallon equivalents. Wasted cancer drugs is only one small part of overspending in healthcare in the U.S. compared with contributors such as excessive use of diagnostic testing and end-of-life care, Goldstein said. At the same time, he added that, "those are very complicated to solve, but this is an extremely simple thing to solve. Content by LendingTree Rates hit 2.75% APR (15 yr).

Korea as new hub 2016/10/05 17:59 Tweet Facebook Share Google +1 Reduce Enlarge Print By Kim Han-joo SEOUL, Oct. 5 (Yonhap) -- Global health care companies are ramping up their research and development (R&D) investment in South Korea as the country emerges as a new global biotech and medical industry hub, industry officials said Wednesday. GE Healthcare Korea said it will build the first APAC Fast Trak Center in Songdo in the western port city of Incheon by investing a total of US$20 million by 2020, in an effort to cultivate talent in the industry. The company said the center is aimed at addressing the challenge of the sector in human resources which many of the leading bio players are facing. The center will help bio pharmaceutical companies improve production efficiency and reduce costs as well. "We're delighted to open our new Fast Trak Center in South Korea that has the flourishing sector and some of the world's leading innovative biopharmaceutical companies. We are looking forward to further support the growth of the industry and provide access to latest technologies and our global competence locally," said Kieran Murphy, president and CEO of GE Healthcare's Life Science, in a press release. The center will provide practical training and manufacturing support by collaborating with local educational institutions, company officials said. "The center will be a base for R&D collaboration for biopharmaceuticals and biosimilars with local conglomerates and bio venture companies," said Song Mi-ok, a GE Healthcare official. Biosimilars refer to a biological medical product which is almost an identical copy of an original product. The company said Songdo is already home to a number of leading South Korean biopharmaceutical companies, and excellent national and international transport links. (Photo courtesy of GE Healthcare) Merck KGaA, Germany-based leading science and technology company, will also open a biotech center in Songdo on Thursday, industry analysts said. The Biotech Training Center, dubbed "M-Lab," will support other major local pharmaceutical firms in production and R&D, they said. The company has been working with major local biopharmaceutical firms -- Samsung Group's biotech unit Samsung BioLogics Co. and Celltrion Inc. -- to develop biosimilars. The center will act as a catalyst for the firm to join forces with local drug makers to expand their global presence in the field, the analysts said. Udit Batra, a member of the executive board of Merck, will attend the opening ceremony and announce details of the center and the outlook of the bio industry, they said. The company said it will officially announce the details of the center on Thursday, refusing to further comment. Johnson & Johnson's JLab in San Francisco. (Yonhap file photo) Johnson & Johnson is also reviewing South Korea as a candidate to house its biotech incubator, J LAB. The center would be the first to be established outside of the North American region, the analysts said. The company currently has five J LABs in the United States and one in Canada, providing entrepreneurs with a shared lab space and offices as well as access to capital funding. The facilities accommodate startups and other companies that represent a range of sectors including therapeutics, medical devices and consumer health solutions. South Korea's bio industry has witnessed robust growth in the past few years, with the exports of biopharmaceutical products jumping 34 percent on-year in 2015. South Korea has an ambitious target to increase pharmaceutical exports to 23 trillion won by 2020. Earlier, South Korea rolled out a package of measures to fuel the growth of the country's biohealth industry, aiming to become a global powerhouse in the sector and add nearly 1 million new jobs. Under the plan, South Korea aims to become a global bio-tech and medical industry hub by investing more in R&D on medicine, medical devices and cosmetics. The government forecast that 940,000 new jobs will be created by 2020 in the industry that is widely viewed as the nation's next growth engine after IT. Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn holds a meeting in Songdo in the western port city of Incheon on March 31, 2016, to discuss measures to boost biotech and medical industry.

ReCell is an investigational medical device that enables medical professionals to collect cells from a small sample of a patient's own skin to create a suspension that can regenerate wounds caused by burns. A pivotal trial of ReCell, which is underway, is expected to be completed in early 2017, following which an application for Pre Market Approval will be submitted. The company hopes its ReCell device to be approved before the end of 2017. AVMXY.OB closed Tuesday's trading at $1.53, up 3.38%. Catabasis Pharmaceuticals Inc. (CATB) has completed target enrollment of 30 patients in Part B of its phase II trial of Edasalonexent for the potential treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. The company has previously reported positive safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and biomarker results from Part A of the trial. Top-line safety and efficacy results from the phase 2 trial, dubbed MoveDMD, are now anticipated in the first half of Q1 2017 compared to previous estimate of late year 2016. CATB closed Tuesday's trading at $5.40, down 6.74%. In after-hours, the stock fell another 1.30% to $5.33. Five Prime Therapeutics Inc. (FPRX) has initiated the phase 1b portion of its phase 1a/1b trial evaluating the immunotherapy combination of Cabiralizumab with Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) approved drug OPDIVO in multiple tumor types. The phase 1a portion of the trial evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics and biomarkers of escalating doses of Cabiralizumab as a monotherapy, as well as in combination with the approved OPDIVO. Cabiralizumab is also in a phase 2 clinical trial in pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) and a phase 1 clinical trial in oncology indications. The drug candidate is being developed under an agreement entered into with Bristol-Myers in October 2015. FPRX closed Tuesday's trading at $52.48, up 1.02%. NewLink Genetics Corp.'s (NLNK) subsidiary has been awarded a contract again, this time valued at $24.8 million, by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, to support the advanced development of investigational Ebola Zaire vaccine candidate. The vaccine, known as V920, is tagged as 'Breakthrough Therapy' by the FDA and as PRIME (PRIority MEdicine) by the European Medicines Agency. Merck (MRK) holds the exclusive rights to develop and distribute V920 in the United States and Canada. NewLink previously received $76.8 million in contracts from BARDA for the development of V920. NLNK closed Tuesday's trading at $14.69, down 1.54%. Ocular Therapeutix Inc. (OCUL) has begun enrollment in the first of two planned phase III clinical trials with OTX-TP for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension. The study is expected to enroll approximately 550 patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension at 50 clinical sites. Top-line results from this study are expected to be available in the first half of 2018. The company plans to commence the second phase 3 clinical trial of OTX-TP in the first half of 2017. A phase III clinical trial of its most advanced product candidate DEXTENZA for post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain is underway, with topline results expected to be available in the fourth quarter of 2016. OCUL closed Tuesday's trading at $6.96, up 1.61%. Otonomy Inc. (OTIC) has successfully completed a phase II clinical trial that evaluated a single administration of OTIPRIO, in two dose levels of 6 mg and 12 mg, for the treatment of pediatric patients with acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes. According to the trial results, both OTIPRIO doses were well-tolerated, achieved higher and statistically significant clinical cure rates over sham (no treatment), with the highest clinical cure rate observed in the 12 mg dose group. OTIPRIO is approved for the treatment of pediatric patients with bilateral otitis media with effusion undergoing tympanostomy tube placement surgery. OTIC closed Tuesday's trading at $17.55, down 0.45%. pSivida Corp.'s (PSDV) second phase III trial of Medidur in chronic, non-infectious posterior segment uveitis has met its target enrollment of 150 patients. The first phase III Medidur trial met the primary efficacy endpoint of prevention of recurrence of posterior segment uveitis at six months in December 2015. The second phase III study has the same study design and endpoints as the first phase III trial. The primary efficacy endpoint readout in the second study is expected in the second half of 2017. PSDV closed Tuesday's trading at $2.83, down 3.74%. It looks like RespireRx Pharmaceuticals Inc. (RSPI.OB) will have to re-analyze the previously reported data from its phase 2A trial of CX1739, as the company has now discovered an error that went noticed until yesterday. The phase 2A trial evaluated the safety as well as the ability of CX1739 to antagonize the respiratory depressive effect of remifentanil (REMI), a potent opioid, without altering its analgesic properties. According to the trial results reported last month, CX1739 was proven to be safe and well tolerated, and antagonized the respiratory depressive effects of remifentanil. Now that an error has been discovered in the data, the company believes that it will effect the efficacy data analysis, although the extent of the effect is not known at this point of time. However, the safety data is expected to remain unchanged. RSPI.OB closed Tuesday's trading at $4.00, down 5.88%. Shares of Summit Therapeutics plc (SMMT) rose as much as 128% on Tuesday, following a $562 million license and collaboration agreement, it inked with Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT). As per the agreement terms, Sarepta has gained rights in Europe, as well as in Turkey and the Commonwealth of Independent States to Summit's utrophin modulator pipeline, including its lead clinical candidate, Ezutromid, for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Sarepta also has the option for Latin American rights. Summit's Ezutromid is under a phase II trial, dubbed PhaseOut DMD, and 24-week biopsy data from initial group of patients are expected in Q2/Q3 2017. The deal entitles Summit to receive an upfront payment of $40 million, with potential future Ezutromid-related milestone payments totaling up to $522 million plus royalties. As you may know, Sarepta's Exondys 51 was granted accelerated approval by the FDA last month, becoming the first drug to be approved in the U.S. to treat patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. SMMT touched a 52-week high of $19.75 on Tuesday, before closing the day's trading at $14.35, up 65.90%. Shares of Trinity Biotech plc (TRIB) plunged over 50% on Tuesday, following withdrawal of its 510(k) premarket notification submission for the Meritas Troponin-I Test and Meritas Point-of-Care Analyzer due to concerns associated with clinical performance of the device. According to the company, the Troponin-I clinical performance is not consistent with the clinical performance data presented by the most recently cleared laboratory Troponin device. The company said, 'Our decision to withdraw is based on the fact that, notwithstanding its excellent performance characteristics, we believe that there is no certainty that this level of performance can be achieved by the Meritas product even with the benefit of further development efforts'. TRIB dropped to a 52-week low of $5.76 on Tuesday, before closing the day's trading at $6.46, down 50.27%.

ReCell is an investigational medical device that enables medical professionals to collect cells from a small sample of a patient's own skin to create a suspension that can regenerate wounds caused by burns. A pivotal trial of ReCell, which is underway, is expected to be completed in early 2017, following which an application for Pre Market Approval will be submitted. The company hopes its ReCell device to be approved before the end of 2017. AVMXY.OB closed Tuesday's trading at $1.53, up 3.38%. Catabasis Pharmaceuticals Inc. (CATB) has completed target enrollment of 30 patients in Part B of its phase II trial of Edasalonexent for the potential treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. The company has previously reported positive safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and biomarker results from Part A of the trial. Top-line safety and efficacy results from the phase 2 trial, dubbed MoveDMD, are now anticipated in the first half of Q1 2017 compared to previous estimate of late year 2016. CATB closed Tuesday's trading at $5.40, down 6.74%. In after-hours, the stock fell another 1.30% to $5.33. Five Prime Therapeutics Inc. (FPRX) has initiated the phase 1b portion of its phase 1a/1b trial evaluating the immunotherapy combination of Cabiralizumab with Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) approved drug OPDIVO in multiple tumor types. The phase 1a portion of the trial evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics and biomarkers of escalating doses of Cabiralizumab as a monotherapy, as well as in combination with the approved OPDIVO. Cabiralizumab is also in a phase 2 clinical trial in pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) and a phase 1 clinical trial in oncology indications. The drug candidate is being developed under an agreement entered into with Bristol-Myers in October 2015. FPRX closed Tuesday's trading at $52.48, up 1.02%. NewLink Genetics Corp.'s (NLNK) subsidiary has been awarded a contract again, this time valued at $24.8 million, by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, to support the advanced development of investigational Ebola Zaire vaccine candidate. The vaccine, known as V920, is tagged as "Breakthrough Therapy" by the FDA and as PRIME (PRIority MEdicine) by the European Medicines Agency. Merck (MRK) holds the exclusive rights to develop and distribute V920 in the United States and Canada. NewLink previously received $76.8 million in contracts from BARDA for the development of V920. NLNK closed Tuesday's trading at $14.69, down 1.54%. Ocular Therapeutix Inc. (OCUL) has begun enrollment in the first of two planned phase III clinical trials with OTX-TP for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension. The study is expected to enroll approximately 550 patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension at 50 clinical sites. Top-line results from this study are expected to be available in the first half of 2018. The company plans to commence the second phase 3 clinical trial of OTX-TP in the first half of 2017. A phase III clinical trial of its most advanced product candidate DEXTENZA for post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain is underway, with topline results expected to be available in the fourth quarter of 2016. OCUL closed Tuesday's trading at $6.96, up 1.61%. Otonomy Inc. (OTIC) has successfully completed a phase II clinical trial that evaluated a single administration of OTIPRIO, in two dose levels of 6 mg and 12 mg, for the treatment of pediatric patients with acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes. According to the trial results, both OTIPRIO doses were well-tolerated, achieved higher and statistically significant clinical cure rates over sham (no treatment), with the highest clinical cure rate observed in the 12 mg dose group. OTIPRIO is approved for the treatment of pediatric patients with bilateral otitis media with effusion undergoing tympanostomy tube placement surgery. OTIC closed Tuesday's trading at $17.55, down 0.45%. pSivida Corp.'s (PSDV) second phase III trial of Medidur in chronic, non-infectious posterior segment uveitis has met its target enrollment of 150 patients. The first phase III Medidur trial met the primary efficacy endpoint of prevention of recurrence of posterior segment uveitis at six months in December 2015. The second phase III study has the same study design and endpoints as the first phase III trial. The primary efficacy endpoint readout in the second study is expected in the second half of 2017. PSDV closed Tuesday's trading at $2.83, down 3.74%. It looks like RespireRx Pharmaceuticals Inc. (RSPI.OB) will have to re-analyze the previously reported data from its phase 2A trial of CX1739, as the company has now discovered an error that went noticed until yesterday. The phase 2A trial evaluated the safety as well as the ability of CX1739 to antagonize the respiratory depressive effect of remifentanil (REMI), a potent opioid, without altering its analgesic properties. According to the trial results reported last month, CX1739 was proven to be safe and well tolerated, and antagonized the respiratory depressive effects of remifentanil. Now that an error has been discovered in the data, the company believes that it will effect the efficacy data analysis, although the extent of the effect is not known at this point of time. However, the safety data is expected to remain unchanged. RSPI.OB closed Tuesday's trading at $4.00, down 5.88%. Shares of Summit Therapeutics plc (SMMT) rose as much as 128% on Tuesday, following a $562 million license and collaboration agreement, it inked with Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT). As per the agreement terms, Sarepta has gained rights in Europe, as well as in Turkey and the Commonwealth of Independent States to Summit's utrophin modulator pipeline, including its lead clinical candidate, Ezutromid, for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Sarepta also has the option for Latin American rights. Summit's Ezutromid is under a phase II trial, dubbed PhaseOut DMD, and 24-week biopsy data from initial group of patients are expected in Q2/Q3 2017. The deal entitles Summit to receive an upfront payment of $40 million, with potential future Ezutromid-related milestone payments totaling up to $522 million plus royalties. As you may know, Sarepta's Exondys 51 was granted accelerated approval by the FDA last month, becoming the first drug to be approved in the U.S. to treat patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. SMMT touched a 52-week high of $19.75 on Tuesday, before closing the day's trading at $14.35, up 65.90%. Shares of Trinity Biotech plc (TRIB) plunged over 50% on Tuesday, following withdrawal of its 510(k) premarket notification submission for the Meritas Troponin-I Test and Meritas Point-of-Care Analyzer due to concerns associated with clinical performance of the device. According to the company, the Troponin-I clinical performance is not consistent with the clinical performance data presented by the most recently cleared laboratory Troponin device. The company said, "Our decision to withdraw is based on the fact that, notwithstanding its excellent performance characteristics, we believe that there is no certainty that this level of performance can be achieved by the Meritas product even with the benefit of further development efforts". TRIB dropped to a 52-week low of $5.76 on Tuesday, before closing the day's trading at $6.46, down 50.27%. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Top Ten Corporate Comeback Stories The Most Influential Books In Business Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 Canadian News BSTC Finds New Use For Old Drug, FHCO Gets A Boost, SUPN Put On Notice All Is Well With ACRS, First Avastin Biosimilar In The Works, CLRB Abuzz Crew Members Hurt As Canadian Plane Swerves To Avoid Possible Drone FDA Snubs DVAX, Keep An Eye On OCUL, It's All Green For BLUE AMGN Crosses BRIDGE, Anxiety Over PTCT's Translarna Eases, EGRX Opens Wallet ANTH Plunges As Lupus Trial Fails, BMY's Opdivo Is At It Again, FDA Nod For GILD 6 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus RELATED NEWS Summit Therapeutics (SMMT) Leaped To A New High After Sarepta Deal Summit Therapeutics (SMMT) Is Spiking To A New High On Sarepta Agreement Trade SMMT now with  Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Volkswagen To Cut 23,000 Jobs In Germany Cyber Monday Sales Seen Soaring LinkedIn Is Now Blocked In Russia Facebook Stops WhatsApp Data Sharing Across Europe Over EU Criticism Wal-Mart Q3 Profit Declines, But Lifts FY17 Profit View; Stock Down JPMorgan Nears Over $250 Mln Settlement Over China Hiring Probe: Reports Comeback Kid: Donald Trump Hugely Resilient In Business, Too Target Lifts Q4, FY16 Forecast As Q3 Results Top Estimates Snapchat Parent Confidentially Initiates IPO Process Amazon Switching From Wrapping Paper To Reusable Bags Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances Home Depot Lifts FY EPS View In Line With Market As Q3 Results Top Estimates United Airlines Announces Plans For Long-term Earnings Growth FDA Snubs DVAX, Keep An Eye On OCUL, It's All Green For BLUE AMGN Crosses BRIDGE, Anxiety Over PTCT's Translarna Eases, EGRX Opens Wallet Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Crew Members Hurt As Canadian Plane Swerves To Avoid Possible Drone LinkedIn Is Now Blocked In Russia Upgrade: Steel Stocks In For Trump Renaissance All Is Well With ACRS, First Avastin Biosimilar In The Works, CLRB Abuzz AAA: Low Gas Prices Drive Spike In Thanksgiving Travel Nokia Sets Financial & Strategic Targets; Remains Focused On Cost Saving Program Vonovia Offers 0.496645 Shares/conwert Shr Or Alternative Cash Of EUR 16.16/shr United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Novartis Reportedly Considering Sale Of Alcon Eye Care Division Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars United Airlines Announces Plans For Long-term Earnings Growth Target Lifts Q4, FY16 Forecast As Q3 Results Top Estimates AMGN Crosses BRIDGE, Anxiety Over PTCT's Translarna Eases, EGRX Opens Wallet AT&T Stream Saver To Limit Video Quality To 480p Genentech: Actemra Meets Endpoints In Phase III GiACTA Study Digi Rejects $13.82/shr Proposal From Belden - Quick Facts Schnuck Markets Recalls Ready-to-eat Grilled Chicken Products Kidde Recalls 3.6 Mln Combination Smoke And Carbon Monoxide Detectors Copyright © 2016 RTTNews.

Katherine Mangu-Ward from the November 2016 issue - view article in the Digital Edition EMAIL SHARE Facebook Twitter Tumblr StumbleUpon Digg Delicious Reddit Google Linkedin Kindle PRINT At the end of August, the U.S. Department of Agriculture bought 11 million pounds of cheese—that's a cheese cube for every man, woman, and child in America—in order to bail out the nation's feckless cheesemongers. RELATED ARTICLES Pill-Induced Abortions on the Rise in America.

(Most of the federal government's new stockpile will go to food banks.) This bailout of Big Cheese came on top of an $11.2 million infusion earlier in the month to dairy farmers enrolled in a 2014 federal financial aid scheme. The deal comes after months of lobbying by the National Farmers Union, the American Farm Bureau, and the National Milk Producers Federation, who were too antsy to wait for their next big cash cow to come ambling in with the farm bill. The same week, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R–Iowa) wrote a letter to the pharmaceutical company Mylan, demanding an explanation for why EpiPens, the epinephrine auto-injectors that severely allergic people carry in case of an emergency, have quadrupled in price since 2007. Grassley cited constituents paying $500 to fill their prescriptions. Hillary Clinton issued a statement about the price increases as well: "Since there is no apparent justification in this case, I am calling on Mylan to immediately reduce the price of EpiPens." Donald Trump used the occasion to score points, tweeting out a story about hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations to the Clinton Foundation from the disgraced company. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D–Minn.) echoed Clinton's sentiment in a letter to the Federal Trade Commission: Lamenting that "antitrust laws do not prohibit price gouging," she asked the regulatory body to look into whether Mylan has used "unreasonable restraints of trade" to keep prices high. The summer's cheese bailout and EpiPen price scandal are ideological Rorschach blots.Where one observer sees only the evils of the profit motive, another looks at the same fact pattern and sees the perils of an overweening regulatory state. Vox sided solidly with the profit shamers, declaring: "We are the only developed nation that lets drugmakers set their own prices, maximizing profits the same way sellers of chairs, mugs, shoes, or any other manufactured goods would." But pseudonymous blogger Scott Alexander of Slate Star Codex responded with a tidy reverse Voxsplanation: The cronyist Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other government forces have squelched nearly every effort to compete with Mylan's EpiPens, distorting the market beyond recognition via a process he chronicles in painful detail. Mylan acquired the EpiPen from Merck in 2007, by which time the product was already 25 years old, which means the question of paying back research costs was moot. In 2009, Teva Pharmaceuticals tried to enter the market—and Mylan sued. Teva managed to get its product to the FDA anyway, only to be told that it had "certain major deficiencies," unspecified. In 2010, Sandoz Inc. tried its luck and got bogged down in the courts, where the case still dwells. In 2011, the French drug company Sanofi made a bid to gain approval for a generic, which was delayed for years because the FDA didn't like the proposed brand name. Which brings us to this year, when Adamis decided to sell plain old pre-filled epinephrine syringes directly to patients without the fancy injector. Cue an FDA recall, on the rather vague basis that insufficient study had been done on standard administration of a drug whose medical properties have been known since the turn of the last century. And sometimes the tangled, dysfunctional relationship between big business and big government gets even more personal. The CEO of Mylan, Heather Bresch, is the daughter of U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin (D–W. Va.), which probably makes things awkward in the Senate cafeteria. But Manchin has joined his colleagues in saying that he is "concerned about the high prices of prescription drugs," which probably makes things awkward at Thanksgiving. Then again, Mylan spends over a million dollars a year lobbying, which likely goes a long way toward smoothing things over. In 2014 Congress passed the School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act, which Grassley mentions in his letter. The law, he writes, "provides an incentive to states to boost the stockpile of epinephrine at schools." It was co-sponsored by Klobuchar, the same senator who now wants to sic the antitrust dogs on Mylan. That law was a top lobbying priority for Mylan that year, along with new rules that reduced competition for generics. Grassley also notes that the taxpayers are picking up the tab for kids who are getting EpiPens while on Medicaid or the state-level Children's Health Insurance Program, and he adds that some 47 states require or encourage schools and other public institutions to stock EpiPens. In other words, Congress created a huge new class of price-insensitive EpiPen customers and now wonders why the price has gone up. Meanwhile, the prescription laws still require you to get a special piece of paper from a doctor every single time you want to buy an EpiPen. If the doctor writes a brand name on that paper, it's illegal for the pharmacist to give you a cheaper generic. The story of the government cheese is just as convoluted. It's easy to be lulled by Vilsack's sell: Helping farmers and the hungry? Sounds great! But you know what else helps move a glut of cheese off the shelves and into the hands of poor people, without requiring taxpayer dollars? Lowering the price. That's something the industry isn't willing to do, and—given all the pricing rules and production quotas that have been distorting dairy markets since the 1930s—mostly can't do. With Americans eating a record 34 pounds of cheese a year, the problem isn't an unexpected drop in demand.The problem is a failure to allow the laws of supply and demand to function at all. Eleven million pounds of cheese may seem like small potatoes (to mix culinary metaphors), and it is in the larger scheme of federal spending and meddling. What's another $20 million when the debt is already $20 trillion, after all? But our typically cheerful acceptance of central control of compressed curds and injectable epinephrine shows how widespread and insidious such conditions are in our lives. What would real free market reforms look like, and how would they come about? In this issue, you'll read what Libertarian Party nominees Gary Johnson and Bill Weld would do in the (very unlikely) event that they won the presidency and vice presidency (page 30). Reason TV's Jim Epstein reports on the millennial libertarian activists in Brazil who brought down a corrupt populist president (page 50). And in Detroit, an American city where public services are essentially nonexistent, we detail how residents are building DIY alternatives (page 65). In the meantime, there is no reason to think either the tale of the EpiPens or the saga of the cheese would play out any differently under President Trump or President Clinton. Taxpayer-funded sops to farmers are as bipartisan as it gets, and there is precisely zero chance that a president from either major party would discontinue the practice. Likewise, the iron grip of the FDA on the drug approval process—and the opportunities to purchase influence in that powerful bureaucracy—will not diminish one iota, regardless of which major-party candidate becomes America's Big Cheese in January.

What about the other pharmaceutical corporations tried to enter the market and got shut down by the bribed and subsidised FDA? Sure, those corporations have a profit motive. Why else did their investors invest but to see a return? Corporations are also the investors/shareholders who FUND them. Epipens used to cost well under fifty bux till the present corporation wrangled not only control but a government enforced monopoly. Today, as the article said, they cost above $500 So WHO is after the profit here? FDA who collect HUGE sums of money and have inside connexions to SOME drug companies, that's who. On what substantive basis do FDA keep other players out of that market? I'll lay high stakes at very long odds that, given approval to two or three of these other "players" to bring competing products to market, within a few months Epipens will again cost well under fifty bux. What it will take is to remove GOVERNMENT protection of the present fiefdom now granted by FDA to the ONE provider of this product. The problem wiht gummint control is that THEY decide which products succeed and at what price. You might recall an instance in our earlier history where a government supported and enforced monopoly on stale tea whose price was augmented by a tax imposed by the government/owner of that tea, led to a principled uprising of the population forced to endure such corruption. reply to this report spam log in or register to reply Tionico|10.4.16 @ 6:20PM|# Could it happen again?

WHY do we THE PEOPLE tolerate an annual burden of two TRILLION dollars imposed upon us by another illegal unconstitutional unaccountable government alphabet soup agency called the EPA?

For a small group that's pre-disposed to going along with the majority decision. What are we having for dinner tonight? Where are we holding the company picnic? Who are we inviting to be the guest speaker at the club luncheon? Where will we build the new school? You're better off having one single decision rather than having mom cook 4 different meals, booking 3 different parks, paying for 6 hours worth of speakers, building more schools than you can afford. But central planning is only more efficient and better when having more options leads to worse outcomes for everybody. If mom's cooking spaghetti and I decide to walk up the street to McDonald's, if I ditch the company picnic to go bowling, if I read a book rather than listen to the speaker, if I home-school my kids, how is that hurting anybody else? There's only a limited number of things where everybody pulling in the same direction makes everybody better off and everything else is not a proper role for government.

I remember when weed became legal here, how few people understood the restrictions or regulations that were in plain english, right in the law. reply to this report spam log in or register to reply IceTrey|10.4.16 @ 4:04PM|# Hey we arrest people who try and enter OUR country just for admitting to using cannabis so there! reply to this report spam log in or register to reply Metalib|10.4.16 @ 4:20PM|# Reminds me of when dipsheets were wondering why the Russians weren't exercising their rights to free speech.

Then I discovered that the FDA has been essentially blocking any newcomer in the market of a drug that costs way less than a dollar per unit to produce but also saves lives. So ultimately, yeah, this company has been insulated by Congress from any competition whatsoever and now we're told that it's the evil's of the free market that caused this problem? Color me shocked that a government enforced monopoly is ultimately behind all of this. Obviously the company is at fault for rent seeking in the first place, but the vast majority of consumers will receive a massive price reduction through their insurance (while everyone is mandated to have insurance, which makes me question who's paying out of pocket since clearly they need to be audited by the IRS). If this company hadn't sought to suppress competition through the Federal government, perhaps they wouldn't be under investigation but for me the takeaway lesson is the FedGov shouldn't be picking winners and losers in the first place. I thought that already, but this is an instructive case to explain it to others. reply to this report spam log in or register to reply sarcasmic|10.4.16 @ 9:37AM|# while everyone is mandated to have insurance, which makes me question who's paying out of pocket since clearly they need to be audited by the IRS The new insurance model is to pay premiums that cost just as much as the old insurance that actually paid for stuff, but now you have a several thousand dollar deductible.

If only. The premiums are way up, the deductibles are way up, coinsurance is common even on PPO plans, HMO plans don't even necessarily cover 100% of emergency treatment anymore, and copays have gone from trivial or manageable to "what is the difference between my copay and self payment, exactly?" reply to this report spam log in or register to reply sarcasmic|10.4.16 @ 9:58AM|# Between insurance premiums, and putting enough into the HSA to cover my deductible, I'm paying literally twice what I did before Obamacare. reply to this report spam log in or register to reply BYODB|10.4.16 @ 10:50AM|# Yes, this isn't in dispute by me really. Although in theory after you have enough in your HSA to cover your entire deductible you can reduce the amount you funnel into it based on your projected yearly usage. I would bet, although can't say for sure, that you would still be paying significantly more than what you paid before. The risk pool is fucked, and the only prescription for that is across-the-board rate hikes. (Which is obviously what we've been seeing nation wide in aggregate.) reply to this report spam log in or register to reply BYODB|10.4.16 @ 9:46AM|# If you have allergies that are serious enough to carry around an EpiPen, I would be shocked if you didn't meet your deductible every year regardless. I definitely agree with you, but it seems to me that a deductible of over $5,000 is fairly uncommon. I'm less informed on prescription coverage since I've never worked for a pharmacy, but I've worked at plenty of hospitals and clinics including an Allergist but that was several years ago and the market can change faster than one might expect. reply to this report spam log in or register to reply sarcasmic|10.4.16 @ 9:53AM|# but it seems to me that a deductible of over $5,000 is fairly uncommon.

It's relatively easy to calculate that for a given decrease in deductible there is an equal rise in the premiums. Therefore, the Bronze plans make the most financial sense from a risk perspective. That said, my deductible is $13K for the family, which I don't mind. I do mind paying $15K a year in premiums though. reply to this report spam log in or register to reply BYODB|10.4.16 @ 10:46AM|# Yes, and if you're a family of 3 that comes out to $5,000 a year in a deductible per person. I completely agree with your point as well. If you can afford it in the short term a high deductible plan is the best option for catastrophic care IMO as you can invest what you would otherwise spend in premiums which is a more efficient use of income. reply to this report spam log in or register to reply Tionico|10.4.16 @ 6:37PM|# which is why I opted out. Its a numbers game, and my own financial security is the driving factor. One year's premiums on OhBummerTax are about four times what I've paid out of pocket for ALL my medical care for four decades. Then the deductible is, again, more than ALL my out of pocket medical costs for those four decades.

I wouldn't be at all shocked if the 'solution' is to set a price cap on EpiPen while leaving in place the regulations that keep only one seller in the market. It would be even better if Mylan dropped out of the market at that point and left zero producers in the market, but I already know they won't do that. It would be passing up free money, which isn't something a business (or individual) is going to do. reply to this report spam log in or register to reply kbolino|10.4.16 @ 9:45AM|# It's ludicrous to bring an anti-trust suit against a company who has a government enforced monopoly Ludicrous it may be, but it's definitely happened.

The market price of an EpiPen should be around $40-$50 (more or less the European cost with I think 7-9 producers of the product) just because of insurance distortions. If it was self-pay only I could see the price at around $15-$20 based on the production cost.

There's a cheaper system called Adrenaclick that you can substitute, but in some states you have to get a specific prescription and since most doctors have been pumped hard by sales reps to prescribe Epipen they might not even know there's an alternative much less be willing to prescribe it. However, not all states forbid pharmacists from giving you the generic alternative.

Multiple producers brings competition, never a bad thing... until gummint come along and decide who shall be the ONLY purveyor of the product. ths nation was built up by private capital, invested by wise people, to provide goods/services that were needed. Remember, it was government agencies deciding which railroads got the "right" to operate here and there, but not in that place, and deeded vast tracts of land to them as bribes to build. THAT was the dawn of government manipulating markets. Then, with gummint protections, many of those railroads were able to charge outrageous fees for their service, knowing the alternative was the back of a mule or perhaps a wagon and team. reply to this report spam log in or register to reply UnCivilServant|10.4.16 @ 9:27AM|# Why can't you just let the price of cheese fall so people can enjoy more while the less efficient providers find other lines of business?

News Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Obituaries Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds log in NewLink awarded $25 million contract for Ebola Zaire vaccine Tuesday Oct 4, 2016 at 2:35 PM Oct 4, 2016 at 4:47 PM By Grayson Schmidt, Staff Writer (gschmidt@amestrib.com) After successful initial trials, Ames-based NewLink Genetics will continue development on the Ebola Zaire vaccine (designated V920), thanks to a $25 million contract from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. According to a release issued by NewLink, BARDA has previously awarded $76.8 million in contracts for development of the vaccine, and the new award includes an additional $51 million of contract options. The release also said that the new funding will go towards “manufacturing facility readiness, manufacturing process qualification activities, and additional clinical trials to support regulatory approval of the V920 vaccine.” In July 2016, the NewLink and Merck and Co. reported on two key regulatory milestones for the vaccine, as the U.S Food and Drug Administration granted the V920 vaccine, “Breakthrough Therapy Designation,” and the European Medicines Agency, PRIME status, according to the release. NewLink Infectious Disease Division Chief Scientific Officer and Chief Operating Officer Thomas P. Monath, MD, said in the release, that this new contract will help accelerate production of the vaccine. “This new contract issued by BARDA will enable accelerated full-scale production of V920, once it is approved, and is a critical step in helping to make this vaccine available to the health care community as they work to control epidemics and protect medical workers and others at high risk,” Monath said. The release also said that the Ebola Zaire vaccine candidate was originally engineered by scientists at the Public Health Agency of Canada and was subsequently licensed to NewLink Genetics. Then in late 2014, Merck licensed the vaccine from NewLink Genetics to apply Merck’s vaccine expertise to help accelerate the development of this vaccine candidate. Clinical studies of the vaccine candidate are ongoing.

Merck Launches Two Innovative Technologies to Support Couples on Their Fertility Treatment Journey Merck Launches Two Innovative Technologies to Support Couples on Their Fertility Treatment Journey CHIMICA E FARMACIA Tweet Condividi su WhatsApp Pubblicato il: 04/10/2016 10:16 DARMSTADT, Germany, October 4, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Not intended for U.S. based media  Merck, a leading science and technology company, today announced the launch of two innovative fertility technologies, Gavi™ oocyte protocol and Geri™ medium. Both products help to improve key steps of assisted reproductive treatment (ART) - an area where laboratory technologies play a vital role for treatment success. The launches represent the seventh and eighth product launch in 18 months for the Fertility Technologies unit at Merck, demonstrating the company's healthcare strategy to deliver innovation through best-in class assets. Gavi™ enables clinics to preserve human egg cells, also called oocytes, and embryos at the main stages of ART, while Geri™ medium supports undisturbed cultivation of embryos. "Undergoing fertility treatment means looking at a lot of individual variables to ensure that everything is done for a successful outcome. During this process, couples want to be assured that their healthcare providers have the right tools at hand to assess those variables and help them make their dream of having a baby become a reality," said Rehan Verjee, Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer at Merck's biopharma business. "With our two new products, we provide laboratories with important instruments that support fertility treatment tailored to the clinic and to the individual needs of patients." Preserving oocytes or embryos for future in vitro fertilization and embryo transfers by cooling them to deep sub-zero degrees is a key step in the laboratory. Gavi™ is the world's first automated instrument for this preservation technique, also called vitrification. With its latest product innovation, Gavi™ provides clinicians with added flexibility when taking important treatment decisions with and for their patients. Geri™ medium was developed to help improve another critical factor for successful treatment, embryo cultivation. After fertilization, the embryo needs to grow and develop before it is transferred into a woman's womb. With the single-step culture medium, Merck now provides a way to support undisturbed incubation and optimal embryo development. Both products, developed and manufactured by Australian fertility technologies company, Genea Biomedx, will be available in Europe, with Gavi™ also launching in Canada and additional regions to follow soon. They are commercialized as part of the partnership between Merck and Genea Biomedx that started in 2015. About Gavi™,Geri™ and Gems™   Gavi™ is the world's first automated vitrification instrument, developed with the aim to achieve a consistent and standardized vitrification process. Geri™ is a benchtop incubator with individually controlled incubation chambers per patient to minimize disruptive events to the early-stage embryo. It also incorporates a time-lapse camera to capture images of embryos as they develop. Gems™ is the latest generation of Genea Biomedx's culture media suite for high-quality embryo cultivation. Gavi™, Geri™ and Gems™ received the CE mark clearance in Europe, and also the consumables for Gavi™ and Geri™ are certified. The three devices are not yet cleared for use in the USA. GaviTM, GeriTM and GemsTM are created by Genea Biomedx. All Merck Press Releases are distributed by e-mail at the same time they become available on the Merck Website.

CNBC senior markets contributor Mike Santoli and &quot;Fast Money&quot; trader Steve Grasso weigh in.</p> Congressmen confirm Mylan overcharged Medicaid    Wednesday, 5 Oct 2016 | 4:05 PM ET | 02:07 Two members of Congress on Wednesday accused big drugmaker Mylan of "bilking taxpayers out of millions of dollars" by underpaying Medicaid in rebates owed on sales of the lifesaving device, as they vowed to recoup that money. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Rep. Frank Pallone, Jr., D-N.J., cited a letter from a top federal health official who confirmed that Mylan had been told "on multiple occasions" that the company was misclassifying EpiPens for the purposes of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. For the past five years, Medicaid has spent nearly $800 million on EpiPens. Under the Medicaid rebate program, Mylan, which has hiked EpiPen prices to more than $600 this year, has been paying a 13 percent rebate on the anti-allergy auto-injector's sales to Medicaid because it classifies EpiPen as a generic device. But it should be paying a brand-name product rate of at least 23.1 percent, as well as an extra rebate because it has hiked the price of the device faster than the rate of inflation, according to the letter from acting Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Andy Slavitt to the Senate Finance Committee ranking member Wyden. Slavitt said EpiPen has patent protection, has no Food and Drug Administration-approved equivalents, and was approved by that agency under a "new drug application," all of which make it a brand-name drug. CMS "has, on multiple occasions, provided guidance to the industry and Mylan on the proper classification of drugs and has expressly told Mylan that the product is incorrectly classified," Slavitt wrote. Slavitt's letter said that while CMS notified drugmakers about the correct classification of their products, "it is the manufacturer's responsibility to report accurate product and pricing data to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program." He added that manufacturers can be fined up to $100,000 per item of false information they submit under the rebate agreement. Mylan bought EpiPen from Merck in 2007. But Slavitt's letter noted that EpiPen, since the fourth quarter of 1997, has been incorrectly reported by its sellers as a generic drug for the rebate program. "This incorrect classification has financial consequences for the amount that federal and state governments spend because it reduces the amount of quarterly rebates Mylan owes for EpiPen," Slavitt wrote. However, he also wrote, "At this time, CMS cannot comment on the total amount of rebates owed by Mylan related to this incorrect classification." But Slavitt's letter also said that total Medicaid spending on EpiPen from 2011 through 2015 was $960 million. That spending had grown annually from $66 million in 2011 to $365 million last year. Mylan paid rebates on slightly less than the $960 million amount, which was reduced because of subtractions for so-called dispensing fee — rebates are not assessed on those fees. "After rebates, net Medicaid spending over this five-year period [on EpiPen] was approximately $797 million, reflecting a rebate of 13 percent," Slavitt wrote. Noting that the actual rebate should have been at least 10 percentage points higher, Wyden and Pallone said, "Today's letter is more evidence that while Mylan irresponsibly raised the price of EpiPen, they were also bilking taxpayers out of millions of dollars." "We will ensure taxpayers gets their due," the congressmen said The company previously said it was relying on guidance from CMS about how it classifies EpiPen for the rebate program. Under that program, drugmakers, in exchange for having their products covered by Medicaid, agree to rebate some of the total sales. The rebates are split between the federal government and the 50 states, which jointly run their Medicaid programs with the federal government. In a statement to CNBC, Mylan reiterated that it was following guidance from the federal government on the classification of EpiPens and it referred to a new government rule that intends to clarify ambiguities in Medicaid rebate law. "The new process calls for the submission of an application for non-innovator status to be submitted to CMS on or before April 1, 2017," Mylan said. "It would be premature to comment further on this issue until the CMS process has concluded." Regarding the CMS letter, "Any changes made to the rebate classification in 1997 pre-dated Mylan's acquisition of the product by almost a decade," the company said. "The longstanding written guidance provided by the federal government is consistent with how the product was classified dates back to the 1997 time frame."

Furthermore, rise in adoption for modern contraceptives in the developing economies contribute to the significant growth in the world contraceptives market.

Oral contraceptive drugs or oral contraceptive pills segment accounted for over 85% share in the overall contraceptive drugs market in 2015. Oral pills are the most common type of reversible contraception used globally.

The increase in popularity of male condoms is attributed to their easy accessibility, ease-of-use, and wide acceptance across various regions. Furthermore, intrauterine (IUD) segment is anticipated to exhibit the highest growth, registering a CAGR of 10.1% during the forecast period, owing to their effectiveness in prevention of unwanted pregnancies for almost 1012 years after insertion in the body and transmission of STDs. Based on age group, women ranging between 15 and 24 years, are the major contributors to generate highest revenue in the world contraceptive market. This is owing to the increased usage of contraceptives among the teenagers and early maturity among the teenage girls, raising the demand for contraceptives. However, women aged above 44, are the least contributor to the market growth due to the menopause in women at the age 44 and above. The North American region accounted for majority of the share of the world contraceptives market in 2015. The North American contraceptive market is expected to maintain its lead throughout the forecast period due to increase in awareness among the population, rise in adoption of modern contraceptives, and increase in prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV/AIDS. The U.S. contraceptive market accounts for the largest share in the overall North America contraceptive market. Asia-Pacific region is expected to grow at the fastest pace during the study period, owing to high population base, and proactive governmental bodies that focus on birth control.

Meet the Contributors → Taking Aim at Alexion, Ra Pharma Heads to IPO Queue Ben Fidler October 3rd, 2016 @benthefidler @xconomy Like Us Xconomy Boston —  Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria may be an ultra-rare blood disease, but Alexion Pharmaceuticals makes over $2 billion a year by selling the only approved drug for it, eculizumab (Soliris). Ra Pharmaceuticals is one of those developing an alternative, and the Cambridge, MA, company is looking to Wall Street to help fund the clinical work. Ra filed for an IPO late Friday, aiming to fund the clinical development of an experimental drug called RA101495.  Ra plans to start Phase 2 trials of the drug early next year and release data in the latter half of 2017; the company hopes the trial will build its case that the drug is a threat to Alexion’s (NASDAQ: ALXN) eculizumab. Ra’s RA101495 is subcutaneous injection for people with PNH, a disease in which the complement system—a part of the immune system—destroys red blood cells, causing a host of problems like blood clots and organ failure. Alexion’s eculizumab—which costs more than $500,000 per patient for a year of treatment—is the only approved drug for PNH. It doesn’t cure the disease, but it stops the complement system from attacking red blood cells, which in turn lowers the risk of blood clots and other problems associated with PNH. Eculizumab, however, has to be infused bi-weekly at a clinic, and as Ra says in its prospectus, sometimes patients’ symptoms recur anyway. Ra estimates that there are about 16,000 patients with PNH worldwide. Ra is one of several companies trying to develop new drugs for PNH, including Novartis, Amyndas Pharmaceuticals, Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Akari Pharmaceuticals, and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. Alexion is also developing a longer-lasting version of eculizumab. Like eculizumab, Ra’s drug blocks a protein in the complement system called complement component 5. But RA101495 is a peptide drug, not an antibody, and it’s taken via an injection just under the skin. Ra believes that a drug like this, self-administered by patients at home on a more frequent basis (either daily or weekly), could be more convenient for patients and help them better control their PNH. The drug is the first product from a platform Ra is trying to show can combine some of the best properties of antibodies and small molecule drugs. Ra is also developing RA101495 for two other autoimmune diseases, lupus nephritis and refractory generalized myasthenia gravis, which causes progressive muscle weakness. Phase 2 and Phase 1b trials, respectively, will begin in patients with both diseases next year. Ra has a collaboration with Merck on an unspecified cardiovascular disease and some other drug candidates in development, but none of them are in clinical testing as of yet. Ra was formed in 2008, and has raised a total of $86 million in equity financing. (It’s also gotten about $17.5 million so far through its partnership with Merck, and could get another $61.5 million in future payments.) Ra’s most significant shareholders are New Enterprise Associates (22.09 million shares), Morgenthaler Venture Partners (17.38 million shares), Novartis Bioventures (17.23 million shares), Novo A/S (12.50 million shares), Lightstone Capital, and RA Capital Management (both 8.33 million shares). Ra had $40.3 million in cash on hand as of June 30 and had burned through about $50 million since its inception. If it completes the IPO, Ra will trade on the Nasdaq under the symbol “RARX.” Ben Fidler is Xconomy's Deputy Biotechnology Editor.

Biosimilars or follow-on biologics are generic versions of the biopharmaceutical products. These are developed following the patent expiry of an original molecule. Biosimilars have the same biological properties as original drugs and target the same diseases. They have many similarities but are not identical to the reference biopharmaceutical product. The spending on the global monoclonal antibody (mAb) biosimilars market to grow at a CAGR of 4-7% during the period 2015-2020. The report covers the present scenario and the growth prospects of the global monoclonal antibody (mAb) biosimilars market 2016-2020.

The constant itch, to say nothing of the disfigurement, can be so unbearable that many patients consider suicide. There has never been a safe and effective treatment. On October 1, the results of two large clinical trials of a new drug offered hope to the estimated 1.6 million adult Americans with an uncontrolled moderate to severe form of the disease, atopic dermatitis, which is a type of eczema. Most patients who got the active drug, dupilumab, instead of a placebo reported that the itching began to wane within two weeks and was gone in a few months, as their skin began to clear. Nearly 40% of participants who got the drug saw all or almost all of their rash disappear. For some, relief was almost instantaneous. “I knew immediately I was on the drug” and not the placebo, Daniela Velasco, an event planner in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, said. Within a couple of weeks, the ugly red rash that had covered 90% of her body was almost gone. Even better, she said, “for the first time I didn’t feel any itch at all.” The drug blocks two specific molecules of the immune system that are overproduced in patients with this and some other allergic diseases. The only side effects were a slight increase in conjunctivitis, an inflammation of the outer membrane of the eye, and swelling at the injection site. “This is a landmark study,” said Dr Mark Boguniewicz, an atopic dermatitis expert at National Jewish Health and University of Colorado School of Medicine who was not involved with the study. “For us in atopic dermatitis we are entering a new era.” The studies, lasting 16 weeks and involving nearly 1,400 people, were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Dr George D Yancopoulos, the president and chief scientific officer at Regeneron, which, in partnership with Sanofi, makes the drug, said he expects the Food and Drug Administration to rule on dupilumab by March 29, 2017. The drug’s brand name will be Dupixent. The agency has given the drug breakthrough status, which provides expedited development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening diseases. Yancopoulos declined to speculate on dupilumab’s price, saying only that it will be “consistent with the value of the drug.” It is a biologic, the most expensive type of drug, and is injected every two weeks. Atopic dermatitis experts said they have longed for a safe and highly effective treatment. In desperation, some prescribed other drugs off-label, like powerful immunosuppressants or high doses of steroids, which are far from ideal because even if they helped, their side effects can be severe — kidney failure with immunosuppressants, bone loss and even psychotic breaks with high-dose steroids. Patients are miserable, Boguniewicz said. “Our patients and families haven’t slept through the night not for days or weeks but for months or years.” Many doctors provide no treatments other than perhaps creams and ointments that do not stop the itching or soothe the red and weeping rash, said Dr Jonathan I Silverberg of Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine and a principal investigator in one of the studies. Many sufferers can relate to the plight of the defence lawyer played by John Turturro in the HBO series “The Night Of.” He suffers from by atopic dermatitis that started on his legs and his feet and later spread to his neck and head. Like so many patients, he tries treatment after treatment — bleach baths, covering the rash in Crisco and wrapping it with plastic wrap, steroids, Chinese medicine. He scratches it with chopsticks and disgusts people near him. But all to no avail. Such experiences explain the excitement over the new drug, although researchers say they would like to see longer term data. “What we are seeing are some really impressive efficacy numbers,” Silverberg said. “But efficacy alone is not enough. It is the safety profile that is the real key. Everything we are seeing really looks great.” Dr Jon M Hanifin, a professor of dermatology at Oregon Health and Science University and founder of the National Eczema Association, agreed. While not a principal investigator in the study, Hanifin did oversee the care of some patients enrolled in it. “It’s wonderful,” he said. “We walk in the room and patients are smiling. These patients are the worst of the worst. Their life was destroyed.” Yancopoulos was inspired in part to develop the drug because his father had severe atopic dermatitis, which he developed shortly after he got lung cancer at age 70. “More so than the cancer and the chemo, this rash and its horrible itch started dominating his life and ruining its quality,” Yancopoulos said. “Here’s a guy with Stage IIIB lung cancer — basically a death sentence — and he is more concerned and miserable about his skin and his itch.” Curing the itch One participant in the trial, Lisa Tannebaum, a 53-year-old harpist in Stanford, Connecticut, was so thrilled that she wrote a letter to Regeneron suggesting they use her before and after photographs in advertisements. She developed a severe form of the disease 14 years ago and tried everything imaginable in conventional and alternative medicine without relief — specialised diets, immunosuppressive drugs, special clothing, bleach baths. She even had the gold fillings removed from her teeth on the theory that they may be causing an allergic response, but to no avail. “It was like every day I had poison ivy and fire ants on myself,” she said. “You don’t sleep at all. You can’t go out, you have staph infections all the time,” because the skin’s protective barrier is broken by the rash. “I couldn’t drive my kids to school because the itching was so bad I couldn’t put my hands on the steering wheel.” Now, she is performing again and will be playing her harp at Carnegie Hall on October 30. Herb Bull, 71, a retired Merck scientist in Westfield, New Jersey, had mild atopic dermatitis for years until three years ago, when it took a turn for the worse. The rash covered his entire body. Sleep was impossible, itching a constant torment. Even walking was difficult. “He had weeping lesions all over his body,” said his doctor, Dr Emma Guttman-Yassky, a principal investigator in the trial and professor of dermatology and immunology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. “I thought I might as well give up and die,” Bull said.
