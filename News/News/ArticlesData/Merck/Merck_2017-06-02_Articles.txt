Inc. MRK, +0.32% said premarket Friday that a late-stage clinical trial comparing its cancer drug Keytruda to Bristol-Myers Squibb's [: BMY] cancer drug Yervoy found patients on Keytruda had better results. The trial, which enrolled 834 patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma who were either new to treatment or had received one prior treatment, found that treatment with Keytruda was associated with a 30% improvement in survival. About half of patients on Keytruda remained alive nearly three years after starting the therapy, the company said, compared with 39% of patients on Yervoy. The company also reported that Keytruda nearly doubled the progression-free survival rate at nearly three years, with 31% of patients on Keytruda surviving without disease progression, compared to 14% of patients on Yervoy. The results are scheduled to be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting on Sunday. Merck shares were not active in premarket trade. Shares have declined 1.2% over the last three months, compared with a 4.1% decline in Bristol-Myers shares and a 2% rise in the S&P 500 SPX, +0.37% Quote References MRK +0.21 +0.32% SPX +9.01 +0.37% Most Popular Paint your bathroom this color and boost your home’s selling price by $5,400 Two professors finally unearth Obama ‘corruption’ Stock market and bonds rallied at the same time, and it’s befuddling investors No, Ivanka Trump is not the most powerful Jewish woman in America WSJ Privacy Test: Who Can See Your Personal Data?

Liquid Biopsy Panel that Includes MSI Testing-- --Learn More about PGDx's Advanced Cancer Genomic Testing at 2017 ASCO Booth #2078-- News provided by Personal Genome Diagnostics Inc. 02 Jun, 2017, 07:00 ET Share this article BALTIMORE, June 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Personal Genome Diagnostics Inc. (PGDx), a pioneer in cancer genomic testing, today highlighted its patent-pending microsatellite instability (MSI) testing technology following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) accelerated approval of Merck's immuno-oncology agent Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) for children and adults whose advanced solid tumors are marked by microsatellite instability (MSI). This is the first approval of a cancer drug based on the genetic make-up of the tumor rather than its location in the body. Patients will likely be tested for MSI status before receiving Keytruda under the expanded indication. Tumors that display MSI have lost the ability to repair errors in their DNA as a result of a condition known as mismatch repair deficiency (MMR). Researchers from The Johns Hopkins University, PGDx and other institutions have shown that tumors displaying MMR deficiency and MSI are more susceptible to successful treatment with Keytruda and other immuno-oncology drugs. MSI tumors have been identified in colorectal, endometrial, gastric and other types of cancer. "This landmark FDA approval codifies the need to determine whether cancer patients potentially eligible for immuno-oncology therapy have microsatellite instability present in their tumors," said Doug Ward, CEO of PGDx. "It is particularly fitting that the approval involves MSI, a genomic condition whose relevance to cancer therapy was first uncovered by researchers at Johns Hopkins, with assistance from researchers at PGDx.  We were thrilled to license rights to the patent-pending MSI measurement technology for immuno-oncology applications developed at Johns Hopkins, and are proud to be the first to offer it in both tissue and liquid biopsy formats. PGDx is also planning to submit a tissue-based MSI assay for FDA review later this year." PGDx's MSI testing is incorporated in the company's tissue-based CancerSELECT® 125 pan cancer genomic profiling assay and its non-invasive PlasmaSELECT™ 64 pan cancer assay that analyzes circulating tumor DNA in patient plasma. The company also recently received grant funding from the National Cancer Institute to advance liquid biopsy tests for determining a related biomarker known as tumor mutational burden.  PGDx was an early leader in identifying the importance of MSI, contributing to a study on MMR and immune checkpoint blockade presented at the 2015 ASCO Annual Meeting. In that study, researchers found that colorectal cancer patients who had tumors with MSI/MMR deficiency had a much greater therapeutic response to pembrolizumab. The analysis showed that cancer patients with MSI/MMR deficiency on average had more than 20 times the number of mutations in their tumors as similar patients who were not mismatch repair deficient. This finding is consistent with other studies showing that PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockers are most effective against tumors containing many mutations. The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.  "We established PGDx to advance technology invented at Johns Hopkins based on our belief that greater understanding of tumor genomics would ultimately enable more effective and less toxic treatments for cancer," noted Victor E. Velculescu, MD, PhD, a co-founder of PGDx. Dr. Velculescu also is Professor of Oncology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. "This breakthrough approval from the FDA is an important milestone in the realization of that vision. I am proud that PGDx has played a significant role in this advance and that the company will help many more patients realize the benefits of immuno-oncology approaches for cancer treatment." PGDx representatives will be attending the 2017 ASCO Annual Meeting and are available at Booth #2078 to discuss the company's MSI testing and its complete range of cancer genome analysis tools for researchers and clinicians. Research services include exome and targeted approaches for tissue specimens, targeted approaches for plasma samples and a variety of custom tissue and plasma-based options designed to address the specific research needs of cancer researchers and drug developers. PGDx's service offerings for researchers and testing labs are complemented by the clinical services it provides to patients and physicians through its CLIA-certified laboratory, including its CancerSELECT 125 pan cancer genomic profiling assay and the non-invasive PlasmaSELECT™ 64 pan cancer profiling assay, both of which include MSI testing. About Personal Genome Diagnostics Personal Genome Diagnostics (PGDx) is empowering the fight against cancer by unlocking actionable information from the genome for oncology researchers, drug developers, clinicians and patients. The expert team at PGDx draws on a deep understanding of cancer biology, extensive experience in cancer genomics and clinical oncology, and the company's distinctive technologies that precisely identify and characterize unique genomic alterations in tumors.

There is a lot of discussion across biopharma about the increasing complexity in the design and management of clinical trials. Recent estimates suggest the cost of bringing a drug to market is as high as $3 billion, and only 1 in 10 drugs successfully navigate the process and make it to market. These trends are not sustainable, and the use of targeted clinical strategies are being seen as a critical step towards improving success rates. Historically, drug approvals sought to maximize the potential market opportunity both in the initial indication and later line extensions. The rising average duration of trials suggests that a change in strategic approach is valuable, particularly after the recent successes with drugs like Imatinib and Keytruda. Keytruda developed by Merck is indicated for patients with metastatic or advanced non-small cell lung cancer who test positive for TPS>1% PD-L1 expression and negative for EGFR and ALK mutations. This new drug has a mechanism of action that is so tightly understood and critically linked to a clear biomarker strategy that development professionals had the confidence to carefully select patients from specific sub-groups from the earliest trials and demonstrate efficacy from the earliest opportunity, leading to a uniquely accelerated approval and ultimately benefiting both patients and Merck with the granting of a Marketing Authorization. To determine whether these celebrated successes reflect the beginning of a new stage of therapeutic evolution, we wish to understand how deep the shift has occurred towards personalized therapies and how widespread such an approach is across the therapeutic areas within clinical development. By comparing the two periods, 2007-2011 vs. 2012-2016, we can identify a number of trends in the application of specific biomarker roles (therapeutic effect marker, toxic effect marker, disease marker) within active clinical trials. The speakers demonstrate an increase in both the application of specific biomarker types and also highlighting some areas where there are opportunities to increase our knowledge of the underlying biological mechanisms.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 3 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Dynavax Presents Updated Data for SD-101 in Combination with KEYTRUDA(R) (pembrolizumab) Highlighting an ORR in 7 out of 7 Patients Naive to an Anti-PD-1 or Anti-PD-L1 Therapy /EINPresswire.com/ — BERKELEY, CA–(Marketwired – June 02, 2017) – Dynavax Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ: DVAX) announced the presentation of findings in patients with metastatic melanoma in the dose escalation phase of an ongoing Phase 1b/2 study investigating SD-101, Dynavax’s intratumoral TLR9 agonist, in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), an anti-PD-1 therapy developed by Merck, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada. Results evaluating 19 patients for efficacy and 22 patients for safety were presented in a poster at the 2017 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting in Chicago: In 7 anti-PD-1/L1-naïve patients, SD-101 used in combination with KEYTRUDA resulted in an overall response rate (ORR) of 100%, with a complete response (CR) rate of 29%. This is a meaningful increase over use of KEYTRUDA alone, which has already shown a 33% ORR, with a 6% CR.(1) In 12 patients with advanced (stage IIIc/IV) melanoma who had previously failed on anti-PD-1 treatment, introduction of SD-101 resulted in tumor shrinkage in 42% of patients, with 17% having a partial response (PR), indicating an anti-tumor immune response generated by SD-101. The combination of SD-101 and KEYTRUDA in this study, mobilized both innate and adaptive immune response in study participants. Tumor shrinkage was observed in non-injected visceral lesions. „Having 7 out of 7 patients naïve to anti-PD-1/L1 treatment responding is very encouraging,” said Antoni Ribas, M.D., Ph.D., of the Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of California, Los Angeles, and lead investigator. „These results are supported by tumor shrinkage in patients who had previously progressed on anti-PD-1 treatment and by confirmatory laboratory biomarker assessments in tumor biopsies. If these clinical results are sustained in the ongoing trial, this combination, which mobilizes both innate and adaptive immune responses in patients, could represent an important advancement in immuno-oncology.” SD-101 in combination with KEYTRUDA generally was well-tolerated. No dose-limiting toxicities of the combination were observed in any dose cohort, and a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not identified. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were injection site reactions and transient grade 1 to 2 flu-like symptoms, including fever, chills and myalgia. The study also includes biomarker assessments, suggesting that treatment with SD-101 and KEYTRUDA resulted in increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and decreased Th2 in tumor biopsies, consistent with induction of an antitumor immune response. About MEL-01 (KEYNOTE-184) The dose-escalation and expansion study of SD-101 in combination with KEYTRUDA includes patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable Stage IIIc/IV melanoma. The primary endpoints of the trial are MTD and evaluation of the safety of intratumoral SD-101 in combination with KEYTRUDA. In addition, the trial is investigating response as assessed by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, biomarker assessments and duration of response. Patients previously treated with anti-PD-1 and other immunotherapies are included. About SD-101 SD-101 is Dynavax’s proprietary, second-generation, Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist CpG-C class oligodeoxynucleotide. SD-101 is being studied for its multiple anti-tumor activities in innate immune cells and activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells to stimulate T cells specific for antigens released from dying tumor cells. TLR9 agonists such as SD-101 enhance T and B cell responses and provide potent Type 1 interferon induction and maturation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells to antigen-presenting cells. SD-101 is being evaluated in several Phase 1/2 oncology studies to assess its safety and activity.

The theme for this year’s conference is making a difference in cancer care with you, which puts emphasis on a more personalized method of treating cancer. This year is expected to see over 30,000 attendees counting among them the world’s best oncologists, researchers and scientists. Many of the abstracts for ASCO have already been released and stocks have moved in anticipation. However, there are still more abstracts that will be released the day of the presentation. 24/7 Wall St. takes a look at the ASCO annual meeting each year and picks out the companies that could have the biggest boom or bust at the conference. Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) is reporting more data on executing on I-O/chemo, and an update on the progress with Keytruda+IDO. Data from Keytruda in combination with epacodastat from Incyte Corp. (NASDAQ: INCY) could be compelling from the Incyte perspective. Keytruda is used in immunotherapy across multiple cancer designations. This particular partnership is being investigated in patients across five tumor types: metastatic melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), bladder cancer, renal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Shares of Merck were trading at $65.21 on Friday, in a 52-week range of $55.10 to $66.80 and with a consensus analyst price target of $69.30. Over the course of the past month, the stock has risen 4%. Incyte shares were last seen at $130.06. The stock has a consensus price target of $146.60 and a 52-week range of $71.75 to $153.15. Over the past month, the stock is up 5%. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV) focused on ABT-414 in its abstract, and according to analysts early data looks promising, but they are curious for the update that concerns side effects. ABT-414 is designed to be stable in the bloodstream and only release the potent cytotoxic agent once inside targeted cancer cells. In this case it is targeting glioblastoma or malignant tumors affecting the brain or spine. AbbVie shares were trading at $66.93. The 52-week range is $55.06 to $68.12, and the consensus price target is $72.28. Over the past month, the stock has stayed relatively flat. Eli Lilly and Co. (NYSE: LLY) will be presenting further details on abemaciclib with the MONARCH-2 data in abstract 1000. This study looked at abemaciclib in combination with fulvestrant in patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer who had progressed on prior endocrine therapy. Shares were trading at $80.43, with a consensus price target of $89.10 and a 52-week range of $64.18 to $86.72. Over the past month, the stock has dropped a little more than 1%. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (NYSE: BMY) is looking to provide an update on the Opdibo+Yervoy combination. The abstract given by the company focuses on longer-term follow up from the high-profile combination of Opdivo plus Yervoy from the CheckMate-012 study in 1L NSCLC. The efficacy data in the abstract, however, is essentially the same as last year, with updated data to come at the presentation. Shares were trading at $54.75, with a 52-week range of $46.01 to $77.12 and a consensus price target of $57.18. Over the past month, the stock has dropped 2%. ALSO READ: 7 Speculative Biotech and Pharma Stocks That Could Still Double (or More) Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi (NYSE: SNY) are expected to give out an extended cut of data from REGN2810, which focuses on the treatment of advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or in simpler terms skin cancer. The company plans to begin its Phase 3 in NSCLC in the second half, as well as into a registrational study in this rare skin cancer. Shares of Regeneron were trading at $482.55, in a 52-week range of $325.35 to $483.28. The consensus price target is $441.05. Over the past month, the stock has risen 20%. Sanofi shares recently traded at $50.11, with a 52-week range of $36.81 to $50.24 and a consensus analyst target of $51.75. Over past month, the stock has risen 4%.

Results evaluating 19 patients for efficacy and 22 patients for safety were presented in a poster at the 2017 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting in Chicago: In 7 anti-PD-1/L1-naïve patients, SD-101 used in combination with KEYTRUDA resulted in an overall response rate (ORR) of 100%, with a complete response (CR) rate of 29%. This is a meaningful increase over use of KEYTRUDA alone, which has already shown a 33% ORR, with a 6% CR.(1) In 12 patients with advanced (stage IIIc/IV) melanoma who had previously failed on anti-PD-1 treatment, introduction of SD-101 resulted in tumor shrinkage in 42% of patients, with 17% having a partial response (PR), indicating an anti-tumor immune response generated by SD-101. The combination of SD-101 and KEYTRUDA in this study, mobilized both innate and adaptive immune response in study participants. Tumor shrinkage was observed in non-injected visceral lesions. "Having 7 out of 7 patients naïve to anti-PD-1/L1 treatment responding is very encouraging," said Antoni Ribas, M.D., Ph.D., of the Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of California, Los Angeles, and lead investigator. "These results are supported by tumor shrinkage in patients who had previously progressed on anti-PD-1 treatment and by confirmatory laboratory biomarker assessments in tumor biopsies. If these clinical results are sustained in the ongoing trial, this combination, which mobilizes both innate and adaptive immune responses in patients, could represent an important advancement in immuno-oncology." SD-101 in combination with KEYTRUDA generally was well-tolerated. No dose-limiting toxicities of the combination were observed in any dose cohort, and a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not identified. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were injection site reactions and transient grade 1 to 2 flu-like symptoms, including fever, chills and myalgia. The study also includes biomarker assessments, suggesting that treatment with SD-101 and KEYTRUDA resulted in increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and decreased Th2 in tumor biopsies, consistent with induction of an antitumor immune response. About MEL-01 (KEYNOTE-184) The dose-escalation and expansion study of SD-101 in combination with KEYTRUDA includes patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable Stage IIIc/IV melanoma. The primary endpoints of the trial are MTD and evaluation of the safety of intratumoral SD-101 in combination with KEYTRUDA. In addition, the trial is investigating response as assessed by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, biomarker assessments and duration of response. Patients previously treated with anti-PD-1 and other immunotherapies are included. About SD-101 SD-101 is Dynavax's proprietary, second-generation, Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist CpG-C class oligodeoxynucleotide. SD-101 is being studied for its multiple anti-tumor activities in innate immune cells and activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells to stimulate T cells specific for antigens released from dying tumor cells. TLR9 agonists such as SD-101 enhance T and B cell responses and provide potent Type 1 interferon induction and maturation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells to antigen-presenting cells. SD-101 is being evaluated in several Phase 1/2 oncology studies to assess its safety and activity. For information about SD-101 trials that are currently recruiting patients, please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov. About Dynavax Dynavax is a clinical-stage immunology company focused on leveraging the power of the body's innate and adaptive immune responses through toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation. Dynavax is developing product candidates for use in multiple cancer indications, as a vaccine for the prevention of hepatitis B and as a disease modifying therapy for asthma. Dynavax's lead product candidates are SD-101, an investigational cancer immunotherapeutic currently in Phase 1/2 studies, and HEPLISAV-B, a Phase 3 investigational adult hepatitis B vaccine.

Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up PD-1/L1 inhibitors are so-called immune-oncology (IO) drugs that help unleash the body's immune system on cancers. And now five drugmakers -- Merck & Co. Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Roche Holding AG, AstraZeneca PLC, and Pfizer Inc. -- have one on the market. These companies are running hundreds of clinical trials for new uses and combinations of these medicines, and many of these trial results will be revealed at this weekend's American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting in Chicago.  But the market has yet to reckon with how much this crowding might impact its sky-high expectations for these medicines. Wall Street analysts forecast annual sales of the five big drugs alone to more than double by 2020 from $8.4 billion this year: As of this writing, there were 1,315 clinical trials ongoing for the big five PD-1/L1 medicines, according to clinicaltrials.gov, the U.S. government's repository. And 1,102 of them were open, meaning they may be actively recruiting patients and are thus relatively new -- an indicator of how rapidly the number of trials is expanding. A slide from Merck's annual report suggests the number of trials has roughly doubled over the past year. Merck's lead IO drug Keytruda is being tested across 30 tumor types.  It's important to note these numbers count only U.S. trials -- there are many others going on elsewhere in the world. And many more companies beyond the big five are working on similar medicines. A huge number of these trials overlap. Four different companies are running trials combining their drug and Incyte Corp.'s epacadostat, for example. There's also significant overlap for the drugs already on the market, with three or more IO drugs approved to treat lung and bladder cancers. All this crowding will be bad for drugmakers -- though a potential boon for patients and insurance companies covering their prescriptions. An increasingly fragmented market will drive prices down and leave companies with ever-shorter periods of market exclusivity.  This may ultimately come as a shock to investors in some of these firms, given that not all of Wall Street's sales forecasts reflect this crowding. Estimates for market-leading drugs Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo certainly don't. Don't expect to hear many such warnings over the din of trial results being hyped at this weekend's ASCO. But companies and investors inspired to follow the IO stampede should bear the potential consequences in mind. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman NeoGenomics Announces Expansion of Immuno-Oncology Profiling Tests /EINPresswire.com/ — FORT MYERS, FL–(Marketwired – June 02, 2017) – NeoGenomics, Inc. (NASDAQ: NEO), a leading provider of cancer-focused genetic testing services, announced today an expansion of its Immuno-Oncology profiling test menu to reflect recent advances in immunotherapy. The Company has expanded its NeoTYPE® cancer profiles to include Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI) testing. TMB is a new genomic biomarker that is designed to predict response to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies targeting the PD-1 and PD-L1 proteins. Studies in lung, melanoma and bladder cancers showed that objective response to checkpoint immunotherapy was predicted by the presence of high TMB. TMB tests will be available on a standalone basis, and in combination with the various cancer-specific NeoTYPE® Profiles offered at NeoGenomics. MSI testing is being added to our profiling in response to the FDA’s announcement(1) on May 23rd that Merck’s Keytruda drug was approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic solid tumors that have been identified as being MSI-high or mismatch repair deficient (MMR). NeoGenomics offers MSI and MMR testing as part of its comprehensive testing services. Dr. Maher Albitar, the Company’s Senior Vice President, Chief Medical Officer and Director of Research and Development, commented, „Despite the significant success of checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies, not all patients respond to therapy and there is a need to identify the subset of patients that are more likely to respond. NeoGenomics provides a broad range of cancer immuno-profiling tests, including TMB, MMR, MSI, and PD-L1 expression testing, to more precisely determine which patients are good candidates for immunotherapy. This immuno-profiling is combined with genomic profiling for comprehensive multimodality cancer profiling.” Douglas VanOort, NeoGenomics’ Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, „This timely expansion of our state-of-the-art testing services will help physicians better identify which patients will respond to new advanced immunotherapies. The FDA’s announcement last week that it has now approved a drug based on a tumor’s biomarkers without regard to the tumor’s original location is a major development in the fight against cancer, and it aligns well with our extensive menu of tests that examine cancer biomarkers. Our combination of immuno-oncology testing and genomic profiling using a variety of advanced test methodologies is a demonstration of our commitment to be a leader in precision medicine.” (1) U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Press Release, 5/23/2017, FDA Approves First Cancer Treatment for any Solid Tumor with a Specific Genetic Feature.

Xconomy Xperience EXOME National Regions Channels Events Xconomy Awards • Enter Now → EXOME all the information, none of the junk | biotech • healthcare • life sciences Want EXOME sent to you daily? Meet the Contributors → Bio Roundup: ASCO Combo Frenzy, Maine’s Free DNA Tests, Sema4 & More Ben Fidler June 2nd, 2017 @benthefidler @xconomy Like Us Xconomy National —  Over the next four days, the Second City will be the center of the biomedical world. The American Society of Clinical Oncology’s annual meeting in Chicago brings together thousands of researchers from across the globe to discuss the latest progress in the war against cancer. On tap this year: the crush of immunotherapy drug combinations, the latest in cell therapy, advances in targeted cancer drugs and much more. Xconomy has some prep work to get you ready for ASCO below, along with all the rest of the week’s biotech headlines. Let’s get to it. ASCO PREP WORK —When ASCO kicks off today, immunotherapy combinations—experimental cocktails of drugs that fight tumors by boosting the immune system—will be in the spotlight. But with the frenzy to test as many combinations as possible, experts worry that the field is moving too fast, and that the glut of combination trials is bound to provoke a backlash. —Another ASCO theme to watch: drugs that target tumor mutations, and acceptance of the commercial tests needed to find the right patients for them. Xconomy delved into the hurdles these tests face, and one of the high-profile efforts underway in Maine to help increase their adoption among community doctors. —ASCO will also provide the latest updates on CAR-T cellular immunotherapy. One of the main players, Novartis (NYSE: NVS), posted encouraging early results in a study testing its CAR-T treatment, CTL119, along with blood cancer drug ibrutinib (Imbruvica) in leukemia patients. Novartis will divulge more information from the study at ASCO on Monday. —Last week, the FDA approved Merck’s pembrolizumab (Keytruda) for all tumors with a specific genetic signature—a first for the agency. Speaking at the Precision Medicine World Conference at Duke University, top FDA drug evaluator Janet Woodcock explained how the Merck approval, as well as some other recent decisions, show how the FDA is changing the way it reviews drugs. —A new report from QuintilesIMS (NYSE: Q) took a close look at the rising price of oncology care, and found that the global costs of cancer drugs and supportive therapies rose from $91 billion in 2012 to $113 billion in 2016. —Lastly, The Wall Street Journal reported that Waltham, MA-based Tesaro (NASDAQ: TSRO), one of the cancer drugmakers unveiling data at ASCO this year, is now exploring a sale with a price tag that could top $9 billion. FRESH STARTS —Sema4, a 300-employee genomics startup Eric Schadt has been incubating within the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, officially spun out of the New York institution this week with plans to raise cash to boost its capabilities. —Kevin Bitterman, the founding CEO of Editas Medicine among other companies and a longtime partner at Boston-area venture capital firm Polaris Partners, was named a partner at nearby Atlas Venture. OPIOIDS & CRISPR —According to Reuters, Ohio Attorney General Mike deWine sued five drug makers, blaming them in part for his state’s worsening epidemic of opioid addiction. The five pharmas named in the suit are Purdue Pharma; Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceuticals; a unit of Endo International (NASDAQ: ENDP); Cephalon, a unit of Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE: TEVA); and Allergan (NYSE: AGN). —Stock prices of Editas Medicine (NASDAQ: EDIT), CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ: CRSP), and Intellia Therapeutics (NASDAQ: NTLA) dropped sharply after the publication of a Nature Methods article that described unintended effects stemming from the use of CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology. But as Xconomy noted two years ago, the possibility of “off-target effects” from use of these tools have long been a concern. NEW FDA REVIEWS & APPROVALS —Positive Phase 3 clinical trial results for a Teva migraine drug now put the Israel-based drugmaker on track to file for FDA approval later this year. A rival drug from Amgen is already under FDA review, and Alder Biopharmaceuticals and Eli Lilly are also in the hunt with similar therapies. — Sunnyvale, CA-based Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG) won FDA clearance for the da Vinci X Surgical System, the latest iteration of its robotic-assisted surgery platform, and will launch it the U.S. later this year. DEALS & FUNDINGS —Mid-size drug developer Bicycle Therapeutics raised $52 million in a Series B round to bring an experimental cancer therapy into clinical trials. —Menlo Park, CA-based Grail, which is developing a blood test to detect cancer at its earliest stages, announced a merger with Cirina, a China-based company founded by blood diagnostics pioneer Dennis Lo. —Newark, CA-based Protagonist Therapeutics (NASDAQ: PTGX) inked a deal with Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) subsidiary Janssen Biotech to develop a drug treating inflammatory bowel disorders such as Crohn’s disease. —ImmunoGen (NASDAQ: IMMU) got $30 million from Sanofi (NYSE: SNY) to amend a 2003 deal and give up its right to co-promote a group of experimental cancer drugs in the U.S.. —Array Biopharma (NASDAQ: ARRY) will get $31.6 million up front in a deal with Ono Pharmaceutical for partial rights to two of the Boulder, CO, biotech’s cancer drugs.

The data showed sustained superior survival outcomes for patients receiving KEYTRUDA (monotherapy) compared to ipilimumab in patients who were treatment-naïve or received one prior line of therapy for the treatment of advanced melanoma. The survival benefit was sustained in patients who completed the planned two years of treatment with KEYTRUDA. These data will be presented in an oral session at the 2017 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in Chicago on Sunday, June 4, from 9:12 to 9:24 a.m. CDT (location:Arie Crown Theater) (Abstract #9504). In the longer-term findings to be presented, treatment with KEYTRUDA was associated with a 30 percent improvement in survival: 50 percent of patients in the KEYTRUDA group (based on a pooled analysis of the two doses studied:10 mg/kg every two weeks or 10 mg/kg every three weeks)(based on a pooled analysis of the two doses studied:n=556) were alive nearly three years (33.9 months) after starting treatment with KEYTRUDA, compared to 39 percent of patients in the ipilimumab group (n=278) (hr:0.70 [95% CI)(hr:0.58-0.86]). In addition, KEYTRUDA nearly doubled the rate of progression-free survival (PFS) at 33.9 months: 31 percent of patients in the KEYTRUDA group were alive and their disease had not progressed, compared to 14 percent of patients in the ipilimumab group. “KEYTRUDA continues to demonstrate improved overall survival compared to ipilimumab, and the findings to be presented at ASCO reinforce the benefit of KEYTRUDA in the treatment of advanced melanoma,” said Dr. Roger Dansey, senior vice president and therapeutic area head, oncology late-stage development, Merck Research Laboratories. The KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) clinical development program includes more than 30 tumor types in more than 500 clinical trials, including more than 300 trials that combine KEYTRUDA with other cancer treatments. Today, KEYTRUDA is approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma in more than 50 countries, including the United States and throughout Europe. “With longer-term follow-up in this study, we are continuing to see superior survival with KEYTRUDA, including in patients whose treatment has concluded,” said Dr. Caroline Robert, head of dermatology at Gustave Roussy, Villejuif and Paris-Sud University Cancer Campus, Grand Paris. “Importantly, these findings also continue to reaffirm the established safety profile for KEYTRUDA.” Key Findings from the KEYNOTE-006 Study KEYNOTE-006 is a global, open-label, randomized, pivotal, phase 3 study evaluating KEYTRUDA compared to ipilimumab in patients with unresectable stage III or IV advanced melanoma who had either not been treated previously (first-line treatment setting) or who had received one prior therapy (in the KEYTRUDA arm 34% received prior therapy; in the ipilimumab arm, 35% received prior therapy). The study randomized 834 patients to receive KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg every three weeks, KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg every two weeks, or four cycles of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every three weeks. Treatment continued until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression; patients without disease progression could be treated for up to 24 months. The co-primary endpoints were PFS and OS; secondary endpoints were overall response rate (ORR), duration of response and safety, with an exploratory analysis for health-related quality of life (QoL). Tumor response was assessed at week 12, then every 6 weeks until week 48, then every 12 weeks thereafter per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 by independent, central, blinded radiographic review and investigator-assessed, immune-related response criteria. The findings to be presented at ASCO were based on a pooled analysis of data from patients receiving the two doses of KEYTRUDA (10 mg/kg every two weeks or 10 mg/kg every three weeks; n=556). Analyses of these data continued to show superior OS, PFS and ORR compared to ipilimumab with follow-up of nearly three years (33.9 months). Specifically, long-term OS data showed 50 percent of patients in the KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) treatment arm (n=556) were alive at 33.9 months after starting treatment, compared to 39 percent of patients in the ipilimumab arm (n=278) (hr:0.70 [95% CI)(hr:0.58-0.86]). The PFS endpoint showed that 31 percent of patients in the KEYTRUDA arm were alive and were disease progression-free at 33.9 months, compared to 14 percent of patients receiving ipilimumab (hr:0.56 [95% CI)(hr:0.47-0.67]). ORR, as assessed by investigator, was 42 percent for patients in the KEYTRUDA arm (range:38-46), compared to 16 percent for patients receiving ipilimumab (range:12-21). In patients in the KEYTRUDA arm, the complete response rate was 13 percent (95% CI, 11-16) and the partial response rate was 29 percent (95% CI, 25-33); in patients in the ipilimumab arm, the complete response rate was 3 percent (95% CI, 1-6) and the partial response rate was 14 percent (95% CI, 10-18). The responses achieved continue to be durable, as the median duration of response has not been reached. Further analyses were conducted to assess the outcomes in patients who had completed 94 or more weeks of treatment with KEYTRUDA (n=104/556) and stopped treatment as planned per protocol. After a median follow-up of 9.7 months since stopping treatment, the estimated PFS was 91 percent (95% CI, 80-96). With longer follow-up, adverse events have remained consistent with previously reported safety data. There was one treatment-related death in the KEYTRUDA arm. In patients treated with KEYTRUDA, immune-mediated adverse events observed in more than 2 percent of patients were hypothyroidism (11%), hyperthyroidism (5%), colitis (3%), skin disorders (3%), and pneumonitis (2%). About Melanoma Melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of pigment-producing cells. The incidence of melanoma has been increasing over the past four decades – approximately 232,000 new cases were diagnosed worldwide in 2012. In the U.S., melanoma is one of the most common types of cancer diagnosed and is responsible for the vast majority of skin cancer deaths. In 2016, an estimated 76,380 people are expected to be diagnosed and an estimated 10,130 people are expected to die of the disease in the U.S. alone. The five-year survival rates for advanced or metastatic melanoma (Stage IV) are estimated to be 15 to 20 percent. About KEYTRUDA [®] (pembrolizumab) Injection KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. Studies of KEYTRUDA – from the largest immuno-oncology program in the industry with more than 500 trials – include a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand factors that predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including the exploration of several different biomarkers across a broad range of tumors. KEYTRUDA is administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every three weeks for the approved indications. KEYTRUDA for injection is supplied in a 100 mg single-dose vial. KEYTRUDA [®] (pembrolizumab)Indications and Dosing Melanoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Lung Cancer KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression [tumor proportion score (TPS) greater-than or equal to 50%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is also indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS greater-than or equal to 1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and progression-free survival. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In metastatic NSCLC, KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. When administering KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy, KEYTRUDA should be administered prior to chemotherapy when given on the same day. See also the Prescribing Information for pemetrexed and carboplatin. Head and Neck Cancer KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In HNSCC, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), or who have relapsed after three or more prior lines of therapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In adults with cHL, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. In pediatric patients with cHL, KEYTRUDA is administered at a dose of 2 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 200 mg) every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Urothelial Carcinoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) is also indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. In locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Microsatellite Instability-High (MSI-H) Cancer KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) solid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options, or colorectal cancer that has progressed following treatment with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. The safety and effectiveness of KEYTRUDA in pediatric patients with MSI-H central nervous system cancers have not been established. In adult patients with MSI-H cancer, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. In pediatric patients with MSI-H cancer, KEYTRUDA is administered at a dose of 2 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 200 mg) every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA [®]  (pembrolizumab) KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 94 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%) pneumonitis, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (6.9%) compared to those without (2.9%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 48 (1.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) colitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 19 (0.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%) hepatitis. Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis. Hypophysitis occurred in 17 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%) hypophysitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency). Administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. KEYTRUDA can cause thyroid disorders, including hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and thyroiditis. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 96 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%) hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism occurred in 237 (8.5%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%) hypothyroidism. Thyroiditis occurred in 16 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%) thyroiditis. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. Administer replacement hormones for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. KEYTRUDA can cause type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia. KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 9 (0.3%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis. KEYTRUDA can cause other clinically important immune-mediated adverse reactions. These immune-mediated reactions may occur in any organ system. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction. The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), exfoliative dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid, rash (1.4%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, and partial seizures arising in a patient with inflammatory foci in brain parenchyma. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and postmarketing use. Solid organ transplant rejection has been reported in postmarketing use of KEYTRUDA. Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment with KEYTRUDA vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients. KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions, including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after being treated with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) on any trial, 6 patients (26%) developed graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), one of which was fatal, and 2 patients (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning, one of which was fatal. Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute GVHD, severe (Grade 3 to 4) acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic VOD, and other immune-mediated adverse reactions, and intervene promptly. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of KEYTRUDA. In KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 21% of patients; the most common (greater-than or equal to 1%) was diarrhea (2.5%). The most common adverse reactions with KEYTRUDA vs ipilimumab were fatigue (28% vs 28%), diarrhea (26% with KEYTRUDA), rash (24% vs 23%), and nausea (21% with KEYTRUDA). Corresponding incidence rates are listed for ipilimumab only for those adverse reactions that occurred at the same or lower rate than with KEYTRUDA. In KEYNOTE-002, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 12% of 357 patients with advanced melanoma; the most common (greater-than or equal to 1%) were general physical health deterioration (1%), asthenia (1%), dyspnea (1%), pneumonitis (1%), and generalized edema (1%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 14% of patients; the most common (greater-than or equal to 1%) were dyspnea (1%), diarrhea (1%), and maculopapular rash (1%). The most common adverse reactions with KEYTRUDA vs chemotherapy were fatigue (43% with KEYTRUDA), pruritus (28% vs 8%), rash (24% vs 8%), constipation (22% vs 20%), nausea (22% with KEYTRUDA), diarrhea (20% vs 20%), and decreased appetite (20% with KEYTRUDA). Corresponding incidence rates are listed for chemotherapy only for those adverse reactions that occurred at the same or lower rate than with KEYTRUDA. It is not known whether KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, instruct women to discontinue nursing during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the final dose.

NEO, +1.04% a leading provider of cancer-focused genetic testing services, announced today an expansion of its Immuno-Oncology profiling test menu to reflect recent advances in immunotherapy. The Company has expanded its NeoTYPE® cancer profiles to include Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI) testing. TMB is a new genomic biomarker that is designed to predict response to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies targeting the PD-1 and PD-L1 proteins. Studies in lung, melanoma and bladder cancers showed that objective response to checkpoint immunotherapy was predicted by the presence of high TMB. TMB tests will be available on a standalone basis, and in combination with the various cancer-specific NeoTYPE® Profiles offered at NeoGenomics. MSI testing is being added to our profiling in response to the FDA's announcement(1) on May 23rd that Merck's Keytruda drug was approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic solid tumors that have been identified as being MSI-high or mismatch repair deficient (MMR). NeoGenomics offers MSI and MMR testing as part of its comprehensive testing services. Dr. Maher Albitar, the Company's Senior Vice President, Chief Medical Officer and Director of Research and Development, commented, "Despite the significant success of checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies, not all patients respond to therapy and there is a need to identify the subset of patients that are more likely to respond. NeoGenomics provides a broad range of cancer immuno-profiling tests, including TMB, MMR, MSI, and PD-L1 expression testing, to more precisely determine which patients are good candidates for immunotherapy. This immuno-profiling is combined with genomic profiling for comprehensive multimodality cancer profiling." Douglas VanOort, NeoGenomics' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "This timely expansion of our state-of-the-art testing services will help physicians better identify which patients will respond to new advanced immunotherapies. The FDA's announcement last week that it has now approved a drug based on a tumor's biomarkers without regard to the tumor's original location is a major development in the fight against cancer, and it aligns well with our extensive menu of tests that examine cancer biomarkers. Our combination of immuno-oncology testing and genomic profiling using a variety of advanced test methodologies is a demonstration of our commitment to be a leader in precision medicine."

Scroll down for video  Jupiter police have released surveillance video showing Tiger Woods (above) in jail attempting to take a breathalyzer test after he was arrested early Monday morning The video shows the 41-year-old golfer barefoot inside of the jail - he appears to be completely disoriented and slightly swaying A few minutes later, a female officer asks the father-of-two to stand up and walk a few steps towards her to take the breathalyzer test, to which he complies.  She instructs him to blow into the test several times, as it appears as though he is confused about how to do so.  'Take a deep breath in and now blow out,' she tells Woods. 'Blow out. Good there you go, keep going keep going.' She then instructs him to take a seat again, but he just continues to stand in front of her for a few moments before she says he can just stand there if he wants to.  He stands there for the next few minutes slightly swaying as his arms are behind his back in handcuffs, before he tries to walk towards the officers in the jail who tell him to keep standing in the same position and to not move. Woods can be heard asking if they can 'take off his two bracelets', as he turns around showing them the handcuffs. The female officer tells the golfer that he has to keep them on for the moment but they will be taken off soon.  Moments later he takes another breathalyzer test and is told again that he can sit down in the chair.  He then agrees to submit to a breathalyzer test and slowly walks over to sit in a nearby chair to take it. While sitting in the chair, he appears to fall asleep briefly as his head is slightly nodding before he leans it completely against the wall A few minutes later, a female officer asks the father-of-two to stand up and walk a few steps towards her to take the breathalyzer test, to which he complies. She instructs him to blow into the test several times, as it appears as though he is confused about how to do so He doesn't move, so the female officer comes to turn him around and lead him back over to the chair that's only a few steps away.    The female officer can be heard telling Woods that he blew .000 on the breathalyzer tests and that it did not detect any alcohol on his breath.  Woods had 'extremely slow and slurred speech' as shown in the disturbing video during his arrest A male officer can be heard asking Woods if he will submit to a urine test for controlled or chemical substances, to which he agrees. Woods then appears as though he's trying to get up from the seat, but the officers tell him that he can remain seated for the moment.  He appears confused as to how he can carry out the task, and asks 'How am I going to hold it?'  Officers then reassure him not to worry and they will get to that eventually and that they have to read him his rights before the 11 minute video ends. On Wednesday, Jupiter police released the shocking video of Woods moments after they found him asleep in his Mercedes Benz with the engine running in the early hours of Monday morning.

Woods also did not complete the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus as he 'did not follow the stimulus.' In total, six members of law enforcement were involved in the arrest, five of whom were on the scene of the incident at some point on Monday.  'Based on all my observations, Woods SFSTs, and statements made by Woods, I believed I had probably cause to arrest and charge Woods with DUI.'

Woods, who occupation is listed as 'athlete,' is facing a traffic misdemeanor for his driving under the influence arrest and will make his first appearance in court later this summer. That appearance is a mandatory one for Woods, who must be in attendance on that date according to the notice he received on Monday. He could be facing up to six months in prison if convicted on the charge, and be ordered to pay $1,000 in fines while performing up to 50 hours of community service. Woods could also walk free if test show he took no more than the recommended dosage of his medication, which was prescribed by a medical professional. It was hard for the golfer to walk according to the report, which notes that he has undergone four left knee surgeries and four Achilles operations. Woods' first knee surgery occurred back in 1994 while he was still in college, with the teenager having a benign tumor removed from his knee. His Achilles injuries meanwhile all came around the same time his career began to spiral back in 2008, with the four operations he underwent occurring between then and 2012.  Not noted on the report is the fact that Woods has also had four procedures done on his back as well, the most recent being the fusion procedure he underwent in April.  Performing under pressure: After failing four field sobriety tests, Woods did manage to successfully recite the national anthem backwards (report above) Family: Wodds and ex-wife Elin Nordegren share custody of their daughter Sam, 9, and son Charlie, 7 (Woods and Nordegren with Sam in 2009 above) 'The surgery went well, and I'm optimistic this will relieve my back spasms and pain,' Woods said shortly after the operation.  'When healed, I look forward to getting back to a normal life, playing with my kids, competing in professional golf and living without the pain I have been battling so long.' His most recent blog post was just six day ago, and the typically laconic Woods wrote in depth about how happy he was with his surgery and his excitement about a possible return to golf. 'It has been just over a month since I underwent fusion surgery on my back, and it is hard to express how much better I feel. It was instant nerve relief. I haven't felt this good in years,' wrote Woods.  He went on to say that while it was a difficult decision to make, he ultimately agreed to the surgery so he could 'have a life with his kids.' VIOXX Woods said he has not taken this in the past year. Vioxx was withdrawn from the US market in 2004 over safety concerns that it increases risk of heart attack and stroke. A major report published by the journal Lancet found that 88,000 Americans had heart attacks from taking Vioxx, and 38,000 of them died. It is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (known medically as rofecoxib) that was once prescribed to treat osteoarthritis, acute pain conditions and period pains. Last year, manufacturer Merck & Co had to pay $830 million to resolve a class action suit with shareholders. The company has reserved $4.85 billion to settle legal claims with patients. Here is a brief timeline: - May 1999: First approved by the FDA in 1999, Vioxx was sold by Merck & Co. - December 1999: within months, a safety panel found that scores of patients had suffered serious heart problems or died - double the rate of those on a similar drug with different properties. - In the ensuing years, numerous studies found similar issues - but in that time, 20 million Americans took the drug - September 2004: Merck withdraws the drug after a large study found the clearest evidence that Vioxx increases the risk of heart attacks Woods then wrote about his career moving forward, stating: 'As for returning to competitive golf, the long-term prognosis is positive. My surgeon and physiotherapist say the operation was successful. It's just a matter of not screwing up and letting it fuse. I'm walking and doing my exercises, and taking my kids to and from school. All I can do is take it day by day. There's no hurry.' He added: 'But, I want to say unequivocally, I want to play professional golf again.' The golfer closed out the post as if it would be his last for some time, writing: 'That's about it for now. Have a great summer.'  Should he return, Woods would still be in striking distance of the two biggest PGA records, with his 79 wins just three shy of Sam Snead's record 82 and his 14 Majors four shy of record-holder Jack Nicklaus. Not one to weigh in on the personal matters of his fellow athletes, Nicklaus was forced to speak about Woods' situation due to the fact that he had a previously scheduled press conference on Tuesday afternoon ahead of the  Memorial Tournament, which he founded over four decades ago. When asked if he wanted to comment, Nicklaus responded: 'Not really.' He then added however: 'I feel bad for Tiger. Tiger's a friend. He needs all our help.'  Woods also owns a restaurant near his home in Jupiter, The Woods. The establishment offers classic American fare and drinks along with a lengthy list of bourbons, ryes, cognacs and cigars.    He released a book this past March as well,   Forbes estimated Woods' net worth to be $740million in 2016, with the golfer making $45.5million just that year in endorsements despite his lackluster play on the links.  Time will now tell if any of those big name sponsors, including Nike and Rolex, opt out of their relationship with the golfer.  Woods resigned with Nike back in 2013, but the company stopped making golf equipment last year, meaning that the athlete is being paid to wear their clothing. Work in progress: It was also hard for the golfer to walk according to the report, which notes that he has undergone four left knee surgeries and four Achilles operations (surgeries above) Rough time: Woods had difficulty signing his name (top left) and then writing in print (bottom right) on his Notice to Appear at 7:30am on Monday morning  And that is something he will not be doing for some time after his surgery.  That personal fortune meanwhile comes after Woods handed over $750million to first wife Elin Nordegren in their 2010 divorce. The couple share custody of their daughter Sam, 9, and son Charlie, 7, with the exact details of their arrangement unknown due to a seal on the court documents, It is unclear if this arrest might impact the agreement between Woods and his ex-wife. Woods apologized for his actions in a statement late Monday, while claiming that he had not been drinking prior to his arrest and believed that he had suffered a reaction to a prescription medication.

'I understand the severity of what I did and I take full responsibility for my actions. I want the public to know that alcohol was not involved,' said Woods. 'What happened was an unexpected reaction to prescribed medications. I didn't realize the mix of medications affected me so strongly.' He went on to state: 'I would like to apologize with all my heart to my family, friends, and the fans. I expect more from myself, too. I will do everything in my power to ensure this never happens again.' Woods then closed out by expressing his gratitude for the local authorities, saying: 'I fully cooperated with law enforcement, and I would like to personally thank the representatives of the Jupiter Police Dept. and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office for their professionalism.'  Share or comment on this article e-mail 2k shares Most watched News videos Kathy Griffin speaks in public on offensive Trump picture CCTV footage of men leading away woman before raping her Dramatic footage of rare mini TSUNAMI hitting Dutch beach resort Man assaults wife and lover after catching them in the act Shocking footage of thieves stealing a MOPED in broad daylight Beefeater tells woman off for throwing glove at Royal Guard Rihanna arrives in plunging white dress at Revolve Social Club Trump announces U.S. will officially withdraw from Paris accord Ariana Grande arrives at Stansted airport ahead of concert Corbyn discusses tackling nuclear threats from N Korea and Iran Footage of man who stole from Portland stabbing victims French President Macron rules out climate renegotiation 'There's a bunch of old white guys trying to silence me!'...

It is often encouraged for pet owners to vaccinate their pets regularly as it is much cheaper than opting for the treatment of a sick animal. It also helps reduce the transmission of germs and bacteria within animals and thus ensures a healthier environment for all animals and pets in an area.

Landgraf as Next President June 2, 2017 by Washington College News Service Leave a Comment CHESTERTOWN—The Washington College Board of Visitors and Governors today announced the appointment of Kurt M. Landgraf as the next President of the college. President-elect Landgraf, who was determined to be an exceptional and highly qualified candidate during the Board’s most recent national search in 2015, will begin his tenure July 1. Kurt M. Landgraf – New President of Washington College “Throughout his remarkable career, Kurt Landgraf has set himself apart from his peers as an exceptional leader and an exemplar of the values we seek to instill in our students, faculty, and community here at Washington College,” said Board Chair H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. “We believe his collaborative leadership style, his ability to craft ambitious and integrated strategies, and his operational experience will be an asset to Washington College. “We are thrilled that such an exceptional candidate was available to lead our College in support of the groundbreaking work of our students and faculty,” Culp continued. “I am deeply honored by the opportunity to join the Washington College community, and to continue the work of my predecessors in providing students with the best possible education,” said Landgraf. “To join the ranks of this storied and historic institution is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I’m certain that by working with the faculty, staff, student body, and board, as well as others in the community, we will be able to accomplish extraordinary things. And while new leadership always brings change, rest assured that President Sheila Bair’s exceptional work to address the national student debt crisis and to launch a comprehensive campaign will not only continue, but I hope will be energized and invigorated.” Landgraf is well known to both the Washington College Board of Visitors and Governors and the most recent presidential search committee. In 2015, that search committee— proportionally comprised of faculty, senior staff, and board members—began its national search for a new president, considering nearly 400 candidates and seriously vetting nearly 60 contenders. During that process, Landgraf proved himself to be an outstanding candidate. Landgraf comes to Washington College with a decades-long résumé as a senior executive with DuPont (including serving as Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chairman of DuPont Europe Middle East and Africa, Chairman and CEO of DuPont Pharmaceutical Company and CEO of DuPont Merck Company), and a 13-year tenure as President and CEO of ETS, one of the world’s leading providers of measurement programs and evaluations for schools, including both the K-12 and higher education communities. Currently, Landgraf serves as a member of the boards of directors for Corning Incorporated and the Louisiana-Pacific Corporation. He has also served as President of the National Consortium for Graduate Degrees for Minorities in Engineering and Science, and was nominated, confirmed, and served as Vice Chairman of the Higher Education Commission for the State of New Jersey, the state’s governing body for higher education institutions. “Kurt Landgraf’s vision of cooperative co-governance will be a strong foundation from which to work together as a campus, and he has already shown a willingness to embrace the Washington College strategic plan. I’m certain his leadership will lend our campus and community essential guidance, and assist us in every facet of operations, from helping fight the national student debt crisis, to accomplishing our unprecedented fundraising goals as part of our Forge a Legacy campaign,” said Jonathan McCollum, Chair of the Washington College Faculty Council and Chair of the Department of Music. “It is a pleasure to welcome President-elect Landgraf to campus, and I look forward to working with him to continue instilling in our students the core values of Washington College: critical thinking, effective communication and deep, abiding moral courage.” “Kurt is an exceptional leader who has an impressive record of success in higher education and the corporate world. At ETS, he did a remarkable job advancing its social mission, reimagining the future of the organization, and building a strong organization and culture,” said Robert Murley, who served as Chair of the ETS Board of Directors for four years during President Landgraf’s tenure as CEO, and who has been an ETS board member for nearly 18 years. “As a result of his leadership and his commitment to diversity and to ensuring fairness and equity in assessment, promising students have been able to realize their dreams to attend college and graduate school regardless of their financial circumstances. Washington College is fortunate to have him as its next president.” About Washington College Founded in 1782, Washington College is the tenth oldest college in the nation and the first chartered under the new Republic. It enrolls approximately 1,450 undergraduates from more than 35 states and a dozen nations. With an emphasis on hands-on, experiential learning in the arts and sciences, and more than 40 multidisciplinary areas of study, the College is home to nationally recognized academic centers in the environment, history, and writing.

B-cells produce different antibodies, which attach themselves to different sites of an antigen. mAbs are monospecific, as they are the clones of a single parent cell. They are complex proteins with high molecular weight, and were first developed in 1975 by Kohler and Milstein. Publisher's analysts forecast the global monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) market to grow at a CAGR of 9.84% during the period 2016-2020.

NEW PRESS RELEASE CATEGORIES ﻿ Health Pulmonary Drug Delivery Devices Market Segment Forecasts up to 2024, Research Reports Transparency Market Research Report Added "Pulmonary Drug Delivery Devices Market" to its database.   PR-Inside.com: 2017-06-02 09:28:14 The global pulmonary drug delivery devices market demonstrates a high degree of competition between GlaxoSmithKline Plc, Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, AstraZeneca Plc, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., and Merck & Co. Inc. states a new research report by Transparency Market Research. With the top five players accounting for more than 67%, the market exhibits a largely consolidated structure. Analysts project this market to remain competitive over the forthcoming years, specifically the drug markets for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), thanks to the robust product pipelines of established drug-makers. This 238 page report gives readers a comprehensive overview of the pulmonary drug delivery devices market. Browse through 42 data tables and 86 figures to unlock the hidden opportunities in this market: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/pulmonary-drug-delivery-syste .. According to the research report, the worldwide market for pulmonary drug delivery devices, which stood at US$32.2 bn in 2015, is expected to progress at a CAGR of 3.30% between 2016 and 2024 and reach US$43.05 bn by the end of the forecast period. The application of these devices is higher in the asthma segment and is expected to remain so over the next few years, thanks to the robust pipeline of drugs for the treatment of asthma. North America to Continue to Lead Global Market An analysis of the geographical presence of the global pulmonary drug delivery devices market has also been presented in this research report. As per the study, Europe, North America, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East and Africa are the prime regional markets for pulmonary drug delivery devices. North America, among these, is leading the global market with Europe trailing closely. The key factor behind the rise of both the regional markets is the increasing prevalence of COPD. With the technological advancements in pulmonary drug delivery devices, North America is likely to retain its position across the world with a share of more than 40% by the end of the forecast period. The markets for pulmonary drug delivery devices in Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East and Africa are also projected to witness significant growth in the next few years, owing to the increasing prevalence of respiratory disorders. The rising level of awareness among consumers regarding health and wellness and the increase in the disposable income are also anticipated to propel these markets in the near future, states the research report. Request a sample of this report to know what opportunities will emerge in the rapidly evolving pulmonary drug delivery devices market during 2016 - 2024: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_ .. Rising Pool of Respiratory Disorder Patients to Fuel Market’s Growth “The rising pool of patients suffering from respiratory disorders is having the most prominent impact on the global market for pulmonary drug delivery devices,” states an analyst at TMR. The alarming rise in air pollution and the increasing number of smokers, worldwide, are adding substantially to the already worsened situation of COPD patient pool, leading to a remarkable surge in the demand for these devices. Analysts expect this scenario to remain so over the period of forecast, resulting in a high demand pace for these devices. In addition to this, the market is anticipated to benefit from the increasing research and development in the treatments for asthma and COPD in the near future. However, the imminent patent expiry of blockbuster drugs and several regulatory hurdles may limit the growth of this market to some extent in the years to come, notes the research study.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Vaccines market based on technology and indication captures the global market very fast | AMR Vaccines Market According to a new report published by Allied Market Research, titled, „Vaccines Market by Technology, Indication, and End Use: Global Opportunity Analysis and Industry Forecast, 2017-2023”, the global vaccines market was valued at $31,216 million in 2016, and is projected to reach $65,148 million by 2023, growing at a CAGR of 10.9% from 2017 to 2023. The conjugate vaccines segment accounted for more than one-third of the global market in 2016. Vaccination administration employs antigenic components, which aid in strengthening an individuals immune system. This process assists in development of adaptive immunity to a pathogen, and thereby prevents morbidity from infection. Vaccination plays an important role in the prevention strategies of infectious diseases adopted by several countries. Demand for vaccines is high in countries susceptible to epidemic diseases, contributing to the significant market growth. Access Full Summary at: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/vaccines-market High prevalence of diseases requiring administration of vaccines and emerging vaccines for different infectious diseases, such as, HIV, dengue, and Zika virus infection, and different technologies employed in the development of effective vaccines are expected to drive growth of the global vaccines market in the future. In addition, focus of governments on immunization programs aids in creating awareness among people about safety and availability of vaccines. However, it takes approximately 11-12 years for a single vaccine to be introduced in the commercial market. This prolonged procedure of vaccine development restrains the development of new vaccines, thereby hampering the market growth. In addition, high monetary inputs in the development of vaccines decrease their adoption, limiting the growth further. The pneumococcal disease segment is anticipated to maintain its dominance during the forecast period, accounting for maximum market revenue throughout forecast period, owing to the fact that Streptococcus pneumoniae (a pathogenic bacteria) is the leading cause of infectious diseases globally. In addition, high prevalence of these diseases in pediatric and geriatric population and growth in demand for varied serotype coverage propel growth of this segment. However, human papilloma virus (HPV) indication is growing at the highest CAGR of 12.4% from 2017 to 2023, as it is the most common type of sexually transmitted disease, specifically in women, which causes cervical cancer, the fourth most common type of cancer prevailing in women. The pediatric vaccine segment dominated the end use market, accounting for about half of the total share in 2016, due to the high immunization rate among infants and adolescents. Moreover, active government participation for amending vaccination to all children has augmented the market growth. Key Findings of the Vaccines Market: 1. The recombinant vaccines segment is anticipated to grow at the highest growth rate during the forecast period. 2. The human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines segment is expected to grow at a rapid rate, registering a CAGR of 12.4% from 2017 to 2023. 3. North America dominated the global vaccines market, accounting for maximum share of overall market in 2016. 4. Asia-Pacific is exhibited to grow at a high growth rate of 12.0%, owing to the high demand for vaccination in densely populated area, such as India and China. 5. The pediatric vaccines segment generated highest revenue in 2016, and is expected to continue its dominance in the future as well. 6.
