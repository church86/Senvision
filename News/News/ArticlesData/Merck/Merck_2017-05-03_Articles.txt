this article INCLINE VILLAGE, Nev., May 3, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- PDL BioPharma, Inc. (PDL or the Company) (NASDAQ: PDLI) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017 including: Total revenues of $45.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. GAAP diluted EPS of $0.04 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. GAAP net income attributable to PDL's shareholders of $7.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Non-GAAP net income attributable to PDL's shareholders of $13.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. A full reconciliation of all components of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial results can be found in Table 4 at the end of the release. "We have had a number of positive events related to our income generating assets this year which have resulted in significant cash infusions, including the repayment of the ARIAD investment and the successful settlement of litigation related to Keytruda," said John P. McLaughlin, president and chief executive officer of PDL. "With a cash balance of over $400 million, and a nimble business development process, we are poised to acquire additional specialty pharma drug products in 2017." Recent Developments In April 2017, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with Merck to resolve the patent infringement lawsuit between the parties pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey related to Merck's Keytruda humanized antibody product. Under the terms of the agreement, Merck will pay the Company a one-time, lump-sum payment of $19.5 million, and the Company will grant Merck a fully paid-up, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to certain of the Company's Queen et al. patent rights for use in connection with Keytruda as well as a covenant not to sue Merck for any royalties regarding Keytruda. In addition, the parties agreed to dismiss all claims in the relevant legal proceedings. The payment of $19.5 million is expected to be recognized as license revenue for the second quarter ending June 30, 2017. On March 1, 2017, the Company announced that its board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $30.0 million of the Company's common stock through March 2018. As of March 31, 2017, the Company has repurchased a total of 3.9 million shares of its common stock in open market transactions under the share repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price of $8.5 million, or an average cost of $2.16 per share. From April 1, 2017 to April 28, 2017, the Company repurchased 3.7 million shares of its common stock under the share repurchase program at a weighted average price of $2.16 per share for a total of $7.9 million. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in March 2017, the Company has repurchased 7.6 million shares of its common stock for a total of $16.4 million. In April 2017, PDL received a royalty payment from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. in the amount of $8.5 million for royalties earned on sales of Glumetza for the month of March. The monthly royalty payment was a result of lower reported gross to net deductions. This payment will be recorded in the second quarter of 2017. Revenue Highlights Total revenues of $45.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 included: Royalties from PDL's licensees to the Queen et al. patents of $14.2 million, which consisted of royalties earned on sales of Tysabri® under a license agreement; Net royalty payments from acquired royalty rights and a change in fair value of the royalty rights assets of $13.1 million, which consisted of the change in estimated fair value of our royalty right assets, primarily related to the Depomed, Inc., University of Michigan, ARIAD and AcelRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Interest revenue from notes receivable financings to kaléo and CareView Communications of $5.5 million; and Product revenues of $12.6 million from sales of Tekturna® and Tekturna HCT® in the United States of $9.7 million and Rasilez® and Rasilez HCT® in the rest of the world (collectively, the Noden Products) of $2.9 million. Total revenues decreased by 56 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2017, when compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease in royalties from PDL's licensees to the Queen et al. patents is due to the period ended March 31, 2016 being the last quarter in which PDL received royalties from Genentech, Inc. The increase in royalty rights - change in fair value was primarily due to the prior year decrease in fair value of the Depomed, Inc. royalty asset. PDL received $13.5 million in net cash royalties from its royalty rights in the first quarter of 2017, compared to $17.2 million for the same period of 2016. The decrease in interest revenues was primarily due to the early repayment of the Paradigm Spine, LLC note receivable investment and the non-accrual status of the LENSAR, Inc. note receivable investment. Product revenues were derived from sales of the Noden Products, which PDL did not begin to recognize until the third quarter of 2016. Operating Expense Highlights Operating expenses were $26.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $9.8 million for the same period of 2016. The increase in operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, was primarily a result of the $15.5 million in expenses related to the Noden operations, including $7.5 million of non-cash intangible asset amortization and a change in fair value of contingent consideration. Other Financial Highlights PDL had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $409.3 million at March 31, 2017, compared to $242.1 million at December 31, 2016. The current cash balance includes a $111.3 million payment from ARIAD as a result of PDL's exercise of its put option under the ARIAD royalty agreement. Net cash provided by operating activities in the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $45.8 million, compared with $92.5 million in the same period in 2016.

We believe that the disclosure of these non-GAAP financial measures provides our investors with additional information that reflects the amounts and financial basis upon which our management assesses and operates our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for reported, or GAAP, net income, and diluted earnings per share, and are not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance performed in conformity with GAAP. "Non-GAAP net income" is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and represent GAAP net income adjusted to exclude (1) mark-to market adjustments related to the fair value election for our investments in royalty rights presented in our earnings, which include the fair value re-measurement of future discounted cash flows for each of the royalty rights assets we have acquired, (2) non-cash interest revenue from notes receivable  (3) stock-based compensation expense, (4) non-cash interest expense related to PDL debt offering costs, (5) mark-to market adjustments related to warrants held, (6) mark-to-market adjustment related to acquisition-related contingent considerations, (7) amortization of intangible assets, and to adjust (7) the related tax effect of all reconciling items within our reconciliation of our GAAP to Non-GAAP net income. Non-GAAP financial measures used by PDL may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

The increase in operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, was primarily a result of the $15.5 million in expenses related to the Noden operations, including $7.5 million of non-cash intangible asset amortization and a change in fair value of contingent consideration. Other Financial Highlights PDL had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $409.3 million at March 31, 2017, compared to $242.1 million at December 31, 2016. The current cash balance includes a $111.3 million payment from ARIAD as a result of PDL's exercise of its put option under the ARIAD royalty agreement. Net cash provided by operating activities in the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $45.8 million, compared with $92.5 million in the same period in 2016.

These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for reported, or GAAP, net income, and diluted earnings per share, and are not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance performed in conformity with GAAP. "Non-GAAP net income" is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and represent GAAP net income adjusted to exclude (1) mark-to market adjustments related to the fair value election for our investments in royalty rights presented in our earnings, which include the fair value re-measurement of future discounted cash flows for each of the royalty rights assets we have acquired, (2) non-cash interest revenue from notes receivable  (3) stock-based compensation expense, (4) non-cash interest expense related to PDL debt offering costs, (5) mark-to market adjustments related to warrants held, (6) mark-to-market adjustment related to acquisition-related contingent considerations, (7) amortization of intangible assets, and to adjust (7) the related tax effect of all reconciling items within our reconciliation of our GAAP to Non-GAAP net income. Non-GAAP financial measures used by PDL may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

Kohls Global Research, May 03, 2017 Duluth Reader Region: USA Theme: Science and Medicine “The full extent of the Gardasil scandal needs to be assessed: everyone knew when this vaccine was released on the American market that it would prove to be worthless…I predict that Gardasil will become the greatest medical scandal of all time because at some point in time, the evidence will add up to prove that this vaccine, technical and scientific feat that it may be, has absolutely no effect on cervical cancer and that all the very many adverse effects which destroy lives and even kill, serve no other purpose than to generate profit for the manufacturers. Gardasil is useless and costs a fortune and decision-makers at all levels are aware of it! Cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome, paralysis of the lower limbs, vaccine-induced MS and vaccine-induced encephalitis can be found, whatever the vaccine.” — Dr Bernard Dalbergue (former Merck employee) “No vaccine manufacturer shall be liable…for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury or death.” – President Ronald Reagan, as he signed The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) of 1986, absolving drug companies from all medico-legal liability when children die, are injured or are disabled from vaccine injuries, thus reversing many of the intentions of the original legislation establishing the FDA “The human immune system is divided into two major classes:  1) Cellular Immunity,(for which injected vaccines do absolutely nothing, except to weaken it) located in the mucous membranes of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts and their respective lymph nodes and 2) Humoral Immunity, with production of antigen-specific antibodies by plasma cells in the bone marrow. For eons of time the mucous membranes of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts have been the primary sites of infectious microbe entry into the body so that, of necessity, mucosal/cellular immunity has evolved as the primary defense system, with humoral immunity serving a secondary or backup role…Vaccines are reversing these roles, attempting to substitute vaccine-induced humoral immunity for the far more efficient mucosal immunity, the latter in turn undergoing a process of “atrophy of disuse” as a result of this role-switching.” – Harold Buttram, MD  “In the field of chemical toxicology it is universally recognized that combinations of toxins may bring exponential increases of toxicity; ie, a combination of two chemicals may bring a 10-fold increase in toxicity, three chemicals 100-fold increases. This same principle almost certainly applies to the immunosuppressive effects of viral vaccines when administered in combination, as with the MMR vaccine, among which the measles vaccine is (known to be)exceptionally immunosuppresive.” – Harold Buttram, MD “…the NIH (National Institutes of Health) is incapable of conducting conflict-free research. …it is clear that the system managing our vaccine program is corrupt beyond repair and needs a complete overhaul.”  – Lori Mellwain, National Autism Association board chair “It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!” –Upton Sinclair, whose 1903 novel “Jungle” led to President Theodore Roosevelt’s pushing through the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906. *** Last year there was an article published in my local newspaper describing an outbreak of a syndrome afflicting a group of young women. The syndrome was eventually labeled by the Mayo Clinic as Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS). As with most of the many iatrogenic illnesses (whose known causes are drug-induced or are caused by physician-prescribed “treatments” such as vaccine administration), the medical establishment regards POTS as having “no known cause”. The young women involved were students that had, according to the article, been ill for an unspecified number of months. The young women were underclass women in a local high school, where they had found each other and started a support group. At least two of them had had symptoms since age the early teens, the typical age at which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) mandate (for pre-sexually active girls) a series of three intramuscular, aluminum-containing inoculations using one of the two FDA-approved, so-called “anti-cervical cancer” vaccines (the Human Papilloma Virus [HPV] vaccines Gardisil and Cervarix). The Big Pharma giant Merck (of Vioxx and MMR/mumps infamy) makes and markets Gardisil and the equally large Big Pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline (of Paxil and Wellbutrin infamy) makes and markets Cervarix. Gardisil contains 4 genetically-engineered human papilloma virus-like antigens in it and Cervarix contains 2. The two vaccines have been approved by the heavily conflicted FDA (corrupted by industry shills) for safety and efficacy and have been pushed by the equally heavily conflicted CDC and AAP. The vaccines are described in more detail in previous Duty to Warn columns (see the links below). The young women had been sickened for months with symptoms that included (according to the newspaper article) dizziness, light-headedness, fainting, headaches, stomach pains, cramps, nausea, “brain fog”, flushing, purplish legs, reddened hands and numbing fatigue. The most frustrating symptom mentioned in the article was that of chronic fatigue. Because I had been doing a lot of research on the American epidemic of vaccine-induced (and therefore iatrogenic) illnesses, I wondered if some of the women had received their series of aluminum-containing HPV shots – or perhaps may have received other vaccinations known to cause vaccine-injuries. Unfortunately I was unable to find out more specific clinical details, but the information given made me want to search the literature. Eventually, I found out that some of the young women had eventually gone to the Mayo Clinic where they received a diagnosis of Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (“of unknown etiology”) – and therefore the girls were offered no cure or suggestions about prevention. And one can assume that they weren’t given any advice about avoiding receiving any toxic substance that could have triggered the illness. Read on. Even though the FDA approved the vaccine to (theoretically) prevent HPV-associated cancer of the uterine cervix, no one will ever be certain if any cancers will actually be prevented until 20 – 30 years from now, because that is how long cancer of the cervix takes to develop after exposure to the carcinogenic virus. And the clinical trial results presented to the FDA only lasted a few years! Nevertheless, the FDA approved the inoculants, and the CDC and AAP immediately started recommending the very expensive shots (up to $130 per shot, not including office visit charges!) for girls of middle school age before there is any sexual activity). Merck’s safety review group acknowledged a number of adverse events observed in the clinical trials of Gardisil, which physicians are supposed to inform patients or parents about before obtaining permission to inject the hazardous substance into the bodies of children. Gardisil’s product insert states:  “local injection site reactions, syncope (fainting), dizziness, nausea, headaches, hypersensitivity reactions (such as rashes, hives, itching and anaphylaxis), Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), transverse myelitis, motor neuron disease, venous thromboembolic events (blood clots), pancreatitis, autoimmune disorders, pregnancy, and death.”  The website of the prestigious Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, just like the websites of most other major clinics that benefit financially from aggressive over-vaccination agendas, mentions the following list of innocuous-sounding adverse effects from HPV inoculations: “may cause soreness at the injection site (the arm), headaches and low-grade fever. Sometimes dizziness or fainting occurs after the injection. Remaining seated for 15 minutes after the injection can reduce the risk of fainting. In addition, Cervarix might also cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or abdominal pain.”    Note that the Mayo Clinic cleverly fails to mention any of the serious life-threatening adverse effects that were listed by the manufacturers, specifically not mentioning death or autoimmune disorders. The principle of informed consent is obviously being side-stepped – even by the Mayo Clinic. Soon after Gardisil was introduced into the CDC’s recommended pediatric vaccination schedule, the independent Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) started reporting numerous adverse events related to the HPV injections, including fainting, pain at the injection site, headaches, nausea, fever, tonic-clonic (jerking) muscular movements and seizure-like activity. Fainting was particularly common after injections. The fainting spells sometimes caused serious injuries, such as head injuries. Just two years after Gardisil’s introduction into the US market, VAERS reported 32 deaths, more or less equally distributed after the first, second or third inoculation. The median interval from vaccination to death was 14.5 days. Other less-frequent illnesses reported by VAERS included: “autoimmune hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, lymphadenopathy, pulmonary embolus, nausea, pancreatitis, vomiting, asthenia (weakness), chills, death, fatigue, malaise, autoimmune diseases, hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, bronchospasm, and urticaria), arthralgia, myalgia, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, dizziness, Guillain-Barré syndrome, headache, motor neuron disease, paralysis, seizures, syncope (sometimes resulting in falling with injury), transverse myelitis, and deep venous thrombosis.”  According to the VAERS website, as of January 2015 there have been 220 HPV vaccine-related deaths, 1,283 chronically disabled patients, 3,945 hospital admissions, 12,305 admissions to emergency rooms, 595 abnormal Pap smears (including 262 cases of cervical dysplasia and 100 cases of cervical cancer!). Note that the FDA has previously admitted that as few as 1% of adverse reactions to drugs or vaccines are ever reported by patients or physicians so these numbers are likely to be falsely low. The real number of adverse events related to HPV could be as high as 100 times more that the reported statistics above! Vaccine-related illnesses or deaths, just like many chronic illnesses from toxic exposures, can be delayed by months. Therefore it is likely that adverse reactions to any vaccine (or prescription drug, for that matter) may not be recognized by the patient or her doctor as being caused by the toxic substance, particularly the occurrence of a vaccine-induced chronic fatigue syndrome, autoimmune disorders or POTS. It is also likely, since physicians are widely and thoroughly indoctrinated into the belief system that all vaccines are totally safe and totally effective, they would tend to be unwilling to admit to any vaccine-related adverse event. I end this article with some more quotes from vaccinology and immunology experts about the serious problems of America’s vaccine industry (and the studied lack of media attention to the truth about vaccines and iatrogenic illnesses) and then end with a few excerpts from some of the multitude of medical journal articles that support the assertions and warnings above. Knowledgeable and informed observers of Big Pharma’s tendency to habitually lie about the value of their newest blockbuster products are shocked at how the medical establishment has accepted these new and dangerous vaccines without much skepticism. Just claiming that Gardisil will prevent future cancers of the cervix is almost laughable – if it weren’t so serious. My column on the absurdity of the medical profession mandating a series of routine HPV vaccinations to all adolescents on the untested and unproven theory that they will prevent cancer 20 – 30 years in the future, can be accessed at: http://duluthreader.com/articles/2015/04/15/5155_open_letter_to_eric_holder_regarding_the_big My column about vaccine-induced injuries, including vaccine-induced chronic childhood illnesses, vaccine-induced autoimmune disorders, aluminum adjuvant toxicity and vaccine-induced mitochondrial toxicity can be accessed at: http://duluthreader.com/articles/2015/12/30/6472_a_look_back_at_some_of_my_2015_duty_to_warn And my column about the vaccine compensation program that is designed to compensate victims of vaccine-induced injury or death is at: https://www.transcend.org/tms/2016/03/duty-to-warn-big-pharmas-nefarious-control-of-health-care-and-the-vaccine-injury-compensation-program/ Below are some useful quotes and also abstracts from peer-reviewed medical journal articles that pertain to and support this discussion. *** “The autism epidemic is real, and excessive vaccinations are the cause.” – Dr Bernard Rimland “Completely unvaccinated children have less chronic disease and a lower risk of autism than vaccinated children.” — J. B. Handley, Jr – founder of Operation Rescue “The soaring incidence of physical and mental illnesses among today’s children (may be) causally related to current childhood vaccine programs. Primary among these is the large-scale contamination of the measles, mumps, and influenza vaccines with retroviruses capable of engrafting their genetics into the DNA of childhood recipients. This is rendered more likely because of the cavalier disregard with which combinations of viral vaccines are now being administered, primarily involving the MMR vaccines…in spite of the toxicology principle that combinations of toxins may bring exponential (10-fold or 100-fold) increases in toxicity.” – Harold Buttram, MD “The really sad thing is the amount of doctors I’ve spoken to who say to me, ‘Del, I know that vaccines are causing autism, but I won’t say it on camera because the pharmaceutical industry will destroy my career just like they did to Andy Wakefield.'”  — Del Bigtree, Producer of “Vaxxed: From Cover-up to Catastrophe” “…our current results are consistent with the existing evidence on the toxicology and pharmacokinetics of Aluminum adjuvants which altogether strongly implicate these compounds as contributors to the rising prevalence of neurobehavioral disorders in children. Given that autism has devastating consequences in a life of a child, and that currently in the developed world over 1% of children suffer from some form of Autism Spectrum Disorder, it would seem wise to make efforts towards reducing infant exposure to aluminum from vaccines.“ — C A Shaw, PhD “There is a serious problem with vaccine safety. Vaccine aluminum adjuvant has adverse neurological effects, at dosages that are recommended by the US CDC. Vaccine critics are supported by the science. Parents refusing to vaccinate according to the recommended CDC schedule are supported by the science. Use aluminum-containing vaccines with great caution, or not at all.” – C. A. Shaw, PhD http://vaccinepapers.org/category/aluminum/ “Aluminum is an experimentally demonstrated neurotoxin and the most commonly used vaccine adjuvant…research clearly shows that aluminum adjuvants have a potential to induce serious immunological disorders in humans. In particular, aluminum in adjuvant form carries a risk for autoimmunity, long-term brain inflammation and associated neurological complications and may thus have profound and widespread adverse health consequences.” — From Tomljenovic and Shaw’s journal article “Aluminum Vaccine Adjuvants: Are They Safe?” *** Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia (POTS) with Chronic Fatigue After HPV Vaccination as Part of the “ASIA Syndrome” Tomljenovic L, Colafrancesco S, Perricone C, and Shoenfeld Y Abstract We report the case of a 14-year-old girl who developed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) with chronic fatigue 2 months following Gardasil vaccination. The patient suffered from persistent headaches, dizziness, recurrent syncope, poor motor coordination, weakness, fatigue, myalgias, numbness, tachycardia, dyspnea, visual disturbances, phonophobia, cognitive impairment, insomnia, gastrointestinal disturbances, and a weight loss of 20 pounds. The psychiatric evaluation ruled out the possibility that her symptoms were psychogenic or related to anxiety disorders. Furthermore, the patient tested positive for ANA (1:1280), lupus anticoagulant, and antiphospholipid. On clinical examination she presented livedo reticularis and was diagnosed with Raynaud’s syndrome. This case fulfills the criteria for the autoimmune/auto-inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA). Because human papillomavirus vaccination is universally recommended to teenagers and because POTS frequently results in long-term disabilities (as was the case in our patient), a thorough follow-up of patients who present with relevant complaints after vaccination is strongly recommended. *** Autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (Shoenfeld’s syndrome): clinical and immunological spectrum Shoenfeld, Y. et al Abstract An adjuvant is a substance that enhances the antigen-specific immune response, induces the release of inflammatory cytokines…The immunological consequence of these actions is to stimulate the innate and adaptive immune response. The activation of the immune system by adjuvants, a desirable effect, could trigger manifestations of autoimmunity or autoimmune disease. Recently, a new syndrome was introduced, autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA), that includes postvaccination phenomena, macrophagic myofasciitis, Gulf War syndrome and siliconosis. This syndrome is characterized by nonspecific and specific manifestations of autoimmune disease. The main substances associated with ASIA are squalene (Gulf War syndrome), aluminum hydroxide (postvaccination phenomena, macrophagic myofasciitis) and silicone with siliconosis. *** Long-term persistence of vaccine-derived aluminum hydroxide is associated with chronic cognitive dysfunction, Gherardi RK, et al Abstract Macrophagic myofasciitis (MMF) is an emerging condition, characterized by specific muscle lesions assessing long-term persistence of aluminum hydroxide within macrophages at the site of previous immunization. Affected patients mainly complain of arthromyalgias, chronic fatigue, and cognitive difficulties. We designed a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests to prospectively delineate MMF-associated cognitive dysfunction (MACD). Compared to control patients with arthritis and chronic pain, MMF patients had pronounced and specific cognitive impairment. MACD mainly affected (i) both visual and verbal memory; (ii) executive functions, including attention, working memory, and planning; and (iii) left ear extinction at dichotic listening test. Cognitive deficits did not correlate with pain, fatigue, depression, or disease duration. Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying MACD remain to be determined. In conclusion, long-term persistence of vaccine-derived aluminum hydroxide within the body assessed by MMF is associated with cognitive dysfunction, not solely due to chronic pain, fatigue and depression. *** A role for the body burden of aluminium in vaccine-associated macrophagic myofasciitis (MMF) and chronic fatigue syndrome Exley C, Gherardi RK, et al Abstract Macrophagic myofasciitis and chronic fatigue syndrome are severely disabling conditions which may be caused by adverse reactions to aluminium-containing adjuvants in vaccines. While a little is known of disease aetiology both conditions are characterised by an aberrant immune response, have a number of prominent symptoms in common and are coincident in many individuals. Herein, we have described a case of vaccine-associated chronic fatigue syndrome and macrophagic myofasciitis (MMF) in an individual demonstrating aluminium overload. This is the first report linking the latter with either of these two conditions and the possibility is considered that the coincident aluminium overload contributed significantly to the severity of these conditions in this individual. This case has highlighted potential dangers associated with aluminium-containing adjuvants and we have elucidated a possible mechanism whereby vaccination involving aluminium-containing adjuvants could trigger the cascade of immunological events which are associated with autoimmune conditions including chronic fatigue syndrome and macrophagic myofasciitis. *** Dr Kohls is a retired physician from Duluth, MN, USA.

(Kris Tripplaar/Sipa USA/Newscom) ALLISON GATLIN 5/03/2017 Reprints Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) is too risky to acquire as Merck (MRK) and Roche (RHHBY) pile on the pressure in immuno-oncology medications, an analyst argued Wednesday as he downgraded Bristol stock to an underperform rating. On the stock market today, Bristol stock was down 1.6% to 55.06. BMO analyst Alex Arfaei attributed the recent move in Bristol stock to near 56 from near 45 in January to takeover speculation. But Pfizer (PFE), an oft-cited potential suitor for Bristol, seems unlikely to make a deal in the near-term, Arfaei said. On Tuesday, during Pfizer's first-quarter earnings call, Chief Executive Ian Read cited macro issues that would make an acquisition difficult. "Pfizer has been, and I expect will continue to be, active industry consolidators," he said. "However, there is a lack of clarity on potential tax reform, health care policies of the U.S. and uncertainties in the European markets with both the French election and the UK snap election." Arfaei called for increasing uncertainty in Bristol's immuno-oncology franchise this year. Merck's immuno-oncology drug Keytruda will likely get the Food and Drug Administration's approval in combination with chemotherapy to treat advanced lung cancer and, also later this month, Merck is likely to unveil strong data for Keytruda plus Incyte's (INCY) epacadostat in a number of tumors. "We don't expect significant new data from Bristol at (American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting), and the conference itself will likely strengthen our argument that the (immuno-oncology) market will become increasingly fragmented," he wrote in a note to clients. IBD'S TAKE: Bristol and Merck are leading the immuno-oncology market. But their days in the sun could be coming to an end. A number of companies are stepping up their immuno-oncology research and offerings. Head to IBD's Technology page for a look at who might rival these two over the coming years. In the latter half of 2017, Arfaei sees Roche's immuno-oncology drug Tecentriq pressuring Bristol in advanced lung cancer. He also expects payers to use data from Bristol to limit the use of its immuno-oncology drugs, Opdivo plus Yervoy, in melanoma. The immuno-oncology battle has pitted Bristol and Merck most directly. Opdivo and Keytruda are both what's known as PD-1 antibodies. They work to block the interaction between an immune system cell and a cancer cell hiding behind a PD-1 protein to help the body identify the cancer. But Bristol has had some wins in the immuno-oncology world recently. Last week, European regulators approved Opdivo as a second-line treatment for squamous cell head-and-neck cancer after platinum-based therapy. The company beat Merck to the approval. Still, Arfaei says Bristol is too reliant on its immuno-oncology drugs which, he estimates, will comprise 50% of sales and 70% of profits by 2021. "Overall, we argue that even if we see positive resolution of the macro factors, given Bristol's overdependence on its (immuno-oncology) franchise and our expectations for increased uncertainty about its potential, a takeout seems unlikely because it is simply too risky," Arfaei wrote.

Merck & Company, Inc. reports earnings, Tuesday, May 2, 2017. (AP Photo/Mel Evans, File) prev next         comments Strict cost controls, along with surging sales of its two newest medicines and a surprisingly strong performance from its entire vaccine portfolio pushed Merck & Co. beyond most expectations for the first quarter and the company boosted its outlook for the year. The company has begun a new cycle in which sales of its latest drugs grow as revenue fades for older drugs facing new generic competition, particularly its blockbuster cholesterol pills Zetia and Vytorin. Other Merck drugs are facing more brand-name competition. Meanwhile Merck's crucial diabetes franchise, already under pressure from insurers for bigger discounts, was hurt by a shift in the timing of orders by large U.S. purchasers. Combined sales of its Januvia and Janumet diabetes treatments dipped 5 percent, to $1.34 billion. Merck's new drugs are picking up the slack, however. Sales of Zepatier, the hepatitis C drug launched a year ago, rocketed to $378 million, a pace that will soon make it a blockbuster with annual sales topping $1 billion. Revenue from the cancer medicine Keytruda, one of the top new immuno-oncology drugs that harness the immune system to fight cancer, more than doubled to $584 million. It's approved for treating melanoma, head and neck cancer, and lung cancer, a fiercely competitive category in which it's the market leader. Keytruda also has pending approvals for bladder cancer, for a rare cancer caused by DNA repair defects and for treating lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy. The latter use could be approved by the middle of next week. Meanwhile, Merck is running scores of other patient tests of Keytruda for still more cancer types. Merck on Tuesday reported net income of $1.55 billion, or 56 cents per share, up from $1.13 billion, or 40 cents per share, a year earlier. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were 88 cents per share, a nickel above what analysts expected. "We're seeing strong performance across all elements of Merck's businesses," CEO Kenneth Frazier told analysts during a conference call. Merck slashed spending on manufacturing and materials a whopping 16 percent to $3.02 billion, while boosting spending on research and development 8 percent to $1.8 billion in the quarter. The drugmaker posted revenue of $9.43 billion, also topping Street forecasts for $9.29 billion. Its prescription drugs business produced $8.19 billion of that revenue, up 1 percent, while its animal health unit had sales of $939 million, up 13 percent. Merck, based in Kenilworth, New Jersey, raised its financial forecast for the year, saying it expects earnings between $2.51 and $2.63 per share, including one-time items, up from its January forecast of $2.47 to $2.62 per share. It now expects revenue of $39.1 billion to $40.3 billion, up from its January forecast for $38.6 billion to $40.1 billion. Credit-Suisse analyst Vamil Divan wrote to investors that sales of Januvia and Gardasil, a vaccine against cancer-causing human papilloma virus, drove Merck's total sales above analysts' expectations, but the second-biggest U.S. drugmaker had greater-than-expected declines to older products Zetia, Vytorin and Remicade, an immune disorder blockbuster whose sales plunged 34 percent to $229 million. In early trading, Merck shares dipped 5 cents to $62.33. _____ Follow Linda A.

Some employees have said they now expect him to shut down the company. Quotes in the article Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc VRX ▼ 9.80 -0.51 -4.95% PTC Inc PTC ▼ 53.58 -1.16 -2.12% PTC Therapeutics Inc PTCT ▼ 12.05 -0.36 -2.90% Horizon Pharma PLC HZNP ▼ 15.12 -0.63 -4.00% His deflated ambition is a sign of the increasingly hostile reaction to drug companies that specialize in sharply raising the prices of old medications. Mr. Aronin did that over and over again for 15 years, most recently after Marathon won approval in February to sell a drug for muscular dystrophy in the U.S. Marathon set the price at $89,000 a year. Some families were paying about $1,200 a year to buy the drug, a steroid called deflazacort, from an online pharmacy in the U.K. and have it shipped to the U.S. Instead of conducting large clinical trials to test its safety and effectiveness, which might have cost tens of millions of dollars, Marathon spent about $370,000 to license data produced in earlier clinical trials. It took only a month for sticker shock to cascade into criticism from families of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a rare and fatal condition that primarily strikes young boys, a shame campaign from congressional lawmakers in both parties and then a surprise deal by Marathon to sell the treatment to another company. Marathon has no other revenue-generating products and is looking to sell its other drug assets, two people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Aronin declined to comment for this article. In response to questions, Marathon spokeswoman Wanda D. Moebius said in an email that the Northbrook, Ill., company is “proud of our success in securing FDA approval for Emflaza,” the drug’s new brand name. “We will continue to manage the legacy matters of Marathon Pharmaceuticals.” Analysts expect the new owner of the drug, PTC Therapeutics Inc., to charge less than Marathon had planned but far more than deflazacort’s price in foreign countries, where it is approved for other conditions but not muscular dystrophy. PTC will announce its price and launch plans next week, said Jane Baj, a spokeswoman for the South Plainfield, N.J., company. It’s too soon to tell if Marathon’s fast retreat has damaged the long-term viability of the business model of sharply raising the prices of drugs. Other companies that have used a similar strategy include Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. and Horizon Pharma PLC. Mr. Aronin, 49 years old, has defended Marathon’s pricing for deflazacort, partly by noting that Marathon had to conduct more than a dozen small studies to test the drug’s safety and absorption in the body. The company has declined to say how much it spent on those studies. According to Marathon, getting the drug approved in the U.S. helped patients because otherwise insurers wouldn’t pay for deflazacort. The drug isn’t a cure but helps improve muscle strength, the FDA said in a statement announcing the approval. Duchenne muscular dystrophy affects about 12,000 boys in the U.S., most of whom die in their 20s and 30s. “Jeff truly sees himself as bringing innovative treatments to patients,” said a person who has worked with Mr. Aronin. Mr. Aronin is Marathon’s chairman and chief executive and owns a large stake in the company. For years, big price increases for niche drugs often got little public attention, says Richard Evans, founder of SSR LLC, an investment research firm in Stamford, Conn. One reason is that the market for those drugs is small compared with those of blockbusters produced by pharmaceutical giants. As companies got more aggressive, though, insurers grew resistant and sometimes refused to pay the sharply higher prices. The practice also prompted congressional investigations and hearings into companies such as Valeant and Turing Pharmaceuticals LLC, the firm formerly run by onetime hedge-fund manager Martin Shkreli. “Once they started doing it routinely, it started getting attention, and the rest is history,” says Mr. Evans, a former drug-industry executive. Mr. Aronin, the owner of an $11 million mansion in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park, Ill., overlooking Lake Michigan, started his first drug company in 2000. He has described the strategy of that company, Ovation Pharmaceuticals Inc., as resurrecting drugs neglected by bigger companies because of their tiny sales. “If some of these products were with Big Pharma they would probably sit on a shelf,” Mr. Aronin told the Chicago Tribune in 2002. Ovation was open about boosting prices on drugs it acquired. As Ovation was in the process of buying six drugs from Merck & Co. in 2005, Ovation looked for a partner to market the drugs outside the U.S. In a presentation shown to potential partners, Ovation said it had acquired a rare-disease drug from Abbott Laboratories in 2003 and then “immediately repriced the product from $289/vial to $1,950/vial” in the U.S. In about two years, Ovation upped the price of another Abbott drug, the barbiturate Nembutal, from about $18 a vial to $133 a vial, the presentation said. The presentation also showed that Ovation planned to increase U.S. prices on the drugs being acquired from Merck by an average of about 500%. Such drugs presented a “high margin business opportunity,” partly because they were “under priced,” according to a copy of the presentation reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. After completing the acquisitions, Ovation raised prices of five of the drugs by an average of 1,360% and kept the price for one about the same, according to data from Truven Health Analytics, part of International Business Machines Corp. Abbott declined to comment. In 2009, Ovation sold itself for $900 million to Danish drugmaker H. Lundbeck A/S. Mr. Aronin got about $60 million from the sale, based on his stake of about 7%, according to a person familiar with the matter. A private-equity firm owned most of the rest of Ovation. Marathon was established in 2008 and had offices in the Chicago suburb of Deerfield, Ill., according to an archived version of the company’s website. Marathon was led at the time by Robert S. Altman, who was listed as the company’s founder. He couldn’t be reached for comment. That year, Marathon bought two barbiturates and a diarrhea medication and soon raised their prices twofold to fivefold, according to data from Truven. Mr. Aronin began working at Marathon in 2012, according to his LinkedIn profile, which also calls him the company’s founder. In 2013, Marathon bought two injectable drugs from Hospira Inc.: Nitropress, a roughly 40-year-old treatment for extremely high blood pressure, and Isuprel, a drug for slow heart rates that came on the market in 1956. Marathon then raised their prices by 3,500% and 350%, respectively. Hospira was later acquired by Pfizer Inc. In 2014, Marathon’s pricing practices drew scrutiny from lawmakers. After receiving complaints, staff members for Rep. Elijah Cummings (D., Md.) started looking into the price increases on Nitropress and Isuprel. Marathon’s drugs became part of a broader investigation by Mr. Cummings and Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent. Mr. Aronin refused to provide much of the information requested by congressional investigators, according to two people familiar with the matter. Mr. Aronin also declined to attend a November 2014 hearing organized by Messrs. Cummings and Sanders, citing travel outside the U.S., said a spokeswoman for Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.). Mr. Aronin’s absence was noted with an empty chair and a placard with his name on it. According to a transcript of the hearing, Mr. Cummings criticized Mr. Aronin for significantly raising the price at Ovation for a heart drug that treats premature babies. “Today, Mr. Aronin is CEO of a new company called Marathon Pharmaceuticals, and they apparently use the same business model,” Mr. Cummings said.© Andrew A. Nelles/TNS/Zuma Press Marathon’s chief executive was shaken by having his name called out at the Senate committee hearing, according to a person familiar with the matter. He soon said privately that he planned to sell the heart drugs. In February 2015, Valeant paid $350 million to acquire the two heart drugs and five other drugs from Marathon. Valeant raised prices on the heart drugs threefold and sixfold the same day. Valeant declined to comment. After criticism, Valeant said last year it wouldn’t raise the prices further and would offer rebates to all U.S. hospitals. Marathon began pursuing deflazacort as a Duchenne treatment in 2013. Some people who worked with Mr. Aronin said the move made perfect sense given Mr. Aronin’s previous success. Other people were surprised that Mr. Aronin decided to pursue the controversial strategy again, especially given how he reacted to criticism about the heart drugs. The company didn’t do the late-stage clinical trials needed to win FDA approval to market deflazacort. That step usually is the costliest part of drug development and often cited by companies as a justification for their prices. Instead, Marathon paid universities, researchers and the Muscular Dystrophy Association to license data from studies of the drug in Duchenne patients conducted in the 1990s, according to interviews with the researchers. The day that the FDA approved deflazacort for sale in the U.S., Marathon announced it would charge 70 times more than what many families had been paying to buy the drug from the U.K. A similar generic drug sold by several companies in the U.S. typically costs less than $10 a month, but some doctors think it has more side effects than deflazacort. Some Duchenne families were pleased that Mr. Aronin had made it far easier to get deflazacort but were horrified at the steep cost. “Jeff Aronin is a terrific guy, but it’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of these families,” said Pat Furlong, president of a Duchenne foundation. Her two sons died of the disease. “Maybe they came in using a model that they used sometime back and were successful with, and said: ‘This will work again.’” Messrs. Cummings and Sanders sent Mr. Aronin a letter requesting details on the price and urging him to lower it. Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) called Marathon’s pricing “nothing short of outrageous.” Lawmakers from both parties questioned whether Marathon took advantage of a special FDA approval program for rare-disease drugs. The program grants seven years of market exclusivity before generics can be approved. Rep. Robert Aderholt (R., Ala.), chairman of a House subcommittee that oversees funding of the FDA, said Marathon’s price increase might be a sign that companies “have found a way to game the system.” An FDA spokeswoman declined to comment on Marathon but said the agency is reviewing its processes for identifying so-called orphan drugs, which affect small numbers of people, to make sure the program “is functioning in the most efficient way possible.” Researchers who originally studied deflazacort as a Duchenne treatment and sold their data to Marathon also were shocked. “We did not know that the price would be sky-high,” said Robert C. Griggs, a neurologist at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry. Four days after Marathon announced the $89,000-a-year price, the company posted on its website a 1,000-word “open letter to the Duchenne community” from Mr. Aronin. “We hear and understand your concerns around the price,” Mr. Aronin wrote. He said Marathon was “pausing our commercialization efforts in order to meet with Duchenne community leaders and explain our commercialization plans, review their concerns, discuss all options, and move forward with commercialization based on the resulting plan of action.” Ms. Furlong read the letter aloud at a meeting in Washington of Duchenne parents, who had gathered to meet with lawmakers and advocate for research and new drugs. Catherine Collins, a parent at the meeting, said Marathon’s pricing was “predatory” and “gross.” The backlash kept growing. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association, a trade group, said Marathon’s actions were “not consistent with the mission of our organization.” Marathon resigned from the group in April. Executives at other drug companies feared an industrywide crackdown by Congress. Mr. Aronin’s brother, Greg Aronin, a former Johnson & Johnson lobbyist hired by Marathon, defended the company in meetings with congressional staff members. His trip to Mr. Aderholt’s office “did not go well,” said a person familiar with the matter. Staffers for Sen. Charles Grassley (R., Iowa) asked Marathon for published studies comparing Emflaza to cheaper steroids, but “that hasn’t come in,” said a spokeswoman for Mr. Grassley. Marathon soon began talks with PTC to sell Emflaza, according to Shane Kovacs, PTC’s chief financial officer. When the sale was announced in March, Mr. Aronin said in another open letter to the Duchenne community that the deal was “the best path forward.” He wrote that it “is a great honor to have been able to work with you to improve the lives of patients and by extension their families.” According to people familiar with the matter, Mr. Aronin seemed to have concluded that the negative publicity was insurmountable. He decided to sell despite reservations from a Marathon executive who favored trying to ride out the controversy. The Emflaza sale was completed in April. Marathon got $140 million in cash and stock, plus more than 20% of the drug’s future sales and a potential $50 million payment.

And while this disease can be avoided through healthy lifestyle choice, it is not a case of choice – especially if you are living well below the breadline. Share this story That was from UCT Associate Professor in Public Health Medicine Tolu Oni on the sidelines of the session of Combating Diseases of Poverty at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday afternoon. "While TB is a major disease and malaria also a big one across Africa, increasingly so are diabetes and hypertension. Because hypertension is a silent disease, it is often only found at a late stage and while there are lifestyle choices such as reduced physical activity, intake of too much salt or genetic factors, sometimes it's not a choice," she said. Oni made up part of the panel moderated by Mail & Guardian Editor-In-Chief at Wednesday's session at the World Economic Forum on Combating Diseases of Poverty. Discussion among the panel, which also included leaders from the pharmaceutical industry such as Pfizer and Merck, as well as Ellen Agler from The End Fund in the US, agreed that health policies regarding diseases found in poverty stricken areas need to be addressed at a broader level and develop policies which incorporate socio-economic factors. "For example caused by worms require vector and water control. We sometimes find eradicable diuseases surge back," said Ellen Agler. Kenya's Minister of Health Cheopa Mailu shared his country's policy's to address health challenges among the poor which focus on mother to child and maternal services. They also focused on ensuring that all disabled people, orphans and senior citizens over 65 are insured with a national hospital insurance. "Governments can put in place practical strategies to bridge the gap," said Mailu. Naveen Rao, Merck for Mothers, said they also focus on mother-tochild and maternal healthcare issues. "If a mother dies in childbirth, it is a signal of failure. Poverty and disease are two sides of a bad coin and they are inextricably linked," sad Rao, adding that of the 20 countries with the highest mortality rates, 17 of these are the world's poorest countries. The panel discussion also highlighted that with many diseases treated in poverty ridden areas, the patient is sent back into the living conditions which are a key factor in the cause of the disease. "We focus on treatment, but neglect the fact we are sending them back into the conditions which caused the problem in the first place," said Oni. The panel agreed that public health needs to be the concern, not only of each government's health department, but also across other governmental departments, as well as the medical and private sectors. The private sector has particularly played a pivotal role in funding research, for example cervical cancer, for which Rao said there is now a vaccine and the possibility of eradicating the disease. The panel also agreed that research needed to be translated into action and more communication between researchers and policy holders is required to ""bridge the chasm between research and reaching communities in need", with a key solution being overseas stakeholders working more closely with African universities.

Their aim? To lure wealthy Chinese patients, who might otherwise venture overseas, to this province in the South China Sea known for its beach-front resorts. To do so they are making an unusual promise: The hub will bring in cutting-edge treatments for diseases like cancer that are available abroad, but don’t yet have regulatory approval in China. There’s plenty of demand. The travel site Ctrip.com estimates about half a million Chinese traveled abroad for medical services last year. Millions are dying from cancer and heart disease, but regulatory bottlenecks have slowed approvals for the newest international therapies. Chinese hospitals are overflowing, and affluent jet-setters prefer Japan for physical check-ups or the U.S. for genetic screenings. Hainan Photographer: Brent Lewin/Bloomberg In 2013, the provincial government of Hainan, often known as China’s Hawaii, earmarked more than 1,600 acres of fertile farm land along a river flowing to its eastern coast for a medical tourism hub. Since then fishing villages and rice paddies are slowly being replaced by palm-tree-flanked driveways. The zone’s first hospitals are opening their doors this summer, the effective beginning of this medical experiment. Local officials say businesses have already committed to spending 23 billion yuan ($3.3 billion) for 27 projects ranging from hospitals to plastic surgery clinics, with dozens more awaiting approval. The mission is partly to "retain domestic consumption," the government body managing the Hainan Boao Lecheng International Medical Tourism Pilot Zone said in e-mailed comments. New Medicines Among the investors are Beijing-based Ciming Health Checkup Management Group and Guangzhou-based medical services firm Evergrande Health Industry Group Ltd., which is being advised by Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School. In an early example, the zone’s Chengmei International Health Center imported 24 vials of the Merck & Co. cancer drug Keytruda for six patients under the special access channel last October, the government says. The medicine is approved in the U.S. and elsewhere, but remains unavailable in the mainland. The special permits by the Chinese regulator only allow for a small amount of the drug to be used in the tourism hub, and it can’t be distributed elsewhere. Merck in a statement said it’s conducting clinical trials on Keytruda in China and doesn’t sell the drug in the country. The China Food and Drug Administration and Chengmei didn’t respond to a request for comment. Ghost Towns By 2025, the hub’s managers want to draw more than one million tourists a year on health-related visits. Still, China has a patchy record of managing specialized economic zones. Centers like Shenzhen, the fishing-village-turned metropolis, have thrived. But others have had a quick boom and bust, like the Caofeidian industrial zone in the northeast, which ended up as a ghost town. The Hainan medical hub’s relatively remote location and the country’s shortage of qualified doctors make it harder to draw patients. Competition for medical resources is fierce, said Chen Bo, associate partner at consultancy McKinsey & Co. “Building health-care capabilities there will require attracting excellent talent to work and live in the pilot zone, and good doctors are already badly needed in China’s major cities,” said Chen.

Sign Up On a recent visit, the area still had the feel of an underdeveloped backwater, showing the challenges to transforming it into a flourishing tourist center. It is dotted with semi-finished hospitals that remain under construction, without medical equipment inside and prefabricated homes outside for construction workers. By the end of March, five facilities had begun operating on a trial basis, local officials say. The Evergrande International Hospital inside the Boao Lecheng International Medical Tourism Pilot Zone. Photographer: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg Evergrande has said it plans to spend 5 billion yuan on its cancer hospital there. Brigham and Women’s hospital in an e-mailed statement said it is serving as a strategic advisor as Evergrande expands its health-care network in China, helping the development of clinical programs and other aspects like training. The hospital was slated to start operating by the end of June, according to a press release on Evergrande’s website. In late March, balloons and banners adorned the hospital’s front gate to celebrate a soft launch of the facility while a quick glance inside the bronze-colored building from a back entrance showed dark rooms with bare concrete walls, unpacked crates and cement piles. Off the main street, behind the hospital pilot zone, was a side road yet to be paved with plywood and empty barrels of asphalt scattered around. Evergrande didn’t respond to a request for comment on the new facility. Construction of the Evergrande International Hospital. Photographer: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg Li Peijuan, an analyst at Forward Industries Institute, a Chinese research firm, said the area can benefit from Hainan island’s environmental beauty, but the quality of service, the standard of medical technology as well as costs will ultimately be key to its success. Foreign medicines have in the past taken longer to reach the Asian country partly because the regulator has been understaffed and so struggled to shepherd surging numbers of drug applications through its complex review process. The China Food and Drug Administration is now in the midst of dramatic reforms to its approval system to reduce the so-called “drug lag” on the mainland. If that succeeds, Hainan will need to find other selling points. “It was very appealing a few years back when approval of innovative drugs was relatively slow, but if the pilot zone can’t build full-fledged medical teams and business models in the next two to three years, its attractiveness will be greatly weakened,” said McKinsey’s Chen. — With assistance by Hui Li, and Jing Yang De Morel Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The accelerated approval has been given for second-line use of the drug - known as Imfinzi in the US - in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) after platinum - containing chemotherapy. The FDA also approved Roche's Ventana PD-L1 assay as a companion diagnostic for assessing PD-L1 protein levels in biopsy tissue. The FDA nod means that AZ is finally out of the blocks in its bid to catch-up with the leaders in the fast-growing immuno-oncology sector, with drugs in the class already on the market from Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck & Co, Roche and Merck KGaA/Pfizer, after the FDA placed durvalumab on a temporary clinical hold last year. AZ's chief executive Pascal Soriot said the approval "is an important milestone in our return to growth and brings us another step closer to our goal of redefining the way cancer is treated". In mUC Imfinzi will compete directly with Roche's Tecentriq (atezolizumab) - which has also picked up a first-line approval for this form of bladder cancer - as well as BMS' Opdivo (nivolumab) which got an FDA approval for second-line mUC in February. Meanwhile Merck's Keytruda (pembrolizumab) has been filed for approval in first-line platinum-ineligible mUC patients, as well as second-line after chemotherapy. AZ is also pursuing a first-line indication for durvalumab, both alone and in combination with its CTLA4 inhibitor tremelimumab - in the phase III DANUBE trial, with first results due in around 12 months. But analysts at Leerink said in a research note that durvalumab will likely only capture a modest 10% of the bladder cancer market estimated at around $2.3bn. A bigger pay-off for AZ could come if it can claim approval for Imfinzi in first-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a much bigger market than bladder cancer and a necessary stepping stone on the way to AZ's ambition to turn the drug into a $6.5bn cancer powerhouse. The combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab is central to that expectation, although analysts think it could be a stretch with peak sales estimates generally around the $2bn mark. AZ has priced its drug at around $15,000 per month ahead of discounts or rebates - with the actual cost depending on the patient's weight - which at face value seems a little higher than the £12,500 charged by Roche for Tecentriq.

Should my child receive the HPV vaccine — what are the side effects? BY  Marchelle Abrahams On  May 3, 2017 Lifestyle & Entertainment, Parenting File photo. CREDIT: Getty Images Human Papilloma Virus vaccine — no answers, more questions. Share this on WhatsApp Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)-related cervical cancer is the second most prevalent cancer in South Africa, according to the Department of Health. It was for this very reason it chose to undertake a massive vaccination campaign, targeting female school pupils between the ages of nine and 12. But in recent weeks, reports have been doing the rounds in the media of the side effects of the vaccine.  Ivanka Nortier, 10, from Kraaifontein has been suffering for the past eight months from what doctors believe to be “possible HPV vaccine associated encephalopathy”. In April last year she received the HPV vaccine. Then in July she collapsed and spent three months unable to walk, speak, eat and in constant pain. Ivanka’s story is not an isolated case. The parents of 11-year-old Zanri Nieuwoudt came forward once news of Ivanka’s illness broke. Zanri’s parents claim she is suffering from lower motor neuron infection which she contracted after receiving the very same vaccine at school. Parents are now asking: Why should my child receive the HPV vaccine; and what are the side effects? The Human Papilloma Virus is a family of viruses of many different sub types, explains Professor Hennie Botha, HOD of Gynaecologist & Obstetriciatics at Stellenbosch University. “If you get infected with the virus and the body is not able to get rid of the infection, your chances of contacting cervical cancer is probable,” he adds. Botha then goes describe how one in 10 people don’t have the ability to clear the infection, hence the importance of immunising against HPV. And the reason for vaccinating girls at such a young age? The reason for doing this is two-fold, says Botha. “The immune system is active at this age. Another reason is that these are preventative vaccines – we want to prevent HPV infection before it starts.” In a nutshell, for the HPV vaccine to be the most effective, the series should be given prior to exposure of the virus. He does, however, add that parents can vaccinate later in life because it does offer life-long protection. According to the makers of the vaccine, MSD (Merck), there are two HPV vaccines available in South Africa. These vaccines prevent 2 types of HPV (HPV16 and 18) that causes up to 70 percent of all cervical cancers. One of the vaccines also protects against the 2 types of HPV (HPV6 and 11) that cause up to 90 percent of all genital warts. When it comes to the side effects, South Africa is not the only country reporting incidents.  In October 2015, the Daily Mail ran a story on side-effects among girls who believe that the HPV vaccine increased fatigue, fits and even becoming reliant on a wheelchair. A lawsuit was also launched against the makers of the vaccines Gardasil (Merck/Sanofi Pasteur) and Cervarix (GSK) worldwide – South Africa currently uses Cervarix in its national schools programme. Japan even went as far as withdrawing the vaccine after multiple complaints. The Medicines Control Council (MCC) monitors the safety of vaccines in SA by reviewing local adverse events (ie: a health problem that occurs after someone receives a vaccine or medicine) reports and liaising with international agencies. But according to MSD, the majority of reported adverse events worldwide following HPV vaccination have been considered mild. Is this a repeat of the MMR scare which started out in the late 90s?  Scaremongering drove parents worldwide to withhold their children being immunised against measles, mumps, and rubella after medical researcher Andrew Wakefield’s notorious study suggested a link between MMR and autism. The study was later discredited, but still the damage has been done. In the meantime, Western Cape health spokesperson Mark van der Heever said he would request the department’s school health services to include “information on side-effects” on all consent forms for future HPV vaccination drives.

There were no proven drugs or vaccines against the virus at the start of the largest outbreak of Ebola in history, which began in Guinea in December 2013. The World Health Organization (WHO) said the findings, being published in the Lancet, could be a "game-changer". Experts said the results were "remarkable". This trial centred on the VSV-EBOV vaccine, which was started by the Public Health Agency of Canada and then developed by the pharmaceutical company Merck. It combined a fragment of the Ebola virus with another safer virus in order to train the immune system to beat Ebola. A unique clinical trial took place in Guinea. When a patient was discovered, their friends, neighbours and family were vaccinated to create a "protective ring" of immunity. One hundred patients were identified in the trial between April and July and then close contacts were either vaccinated immediately, or three weeks later. In the 2,014 close contacts who were vaccinated immediately there were no subsequent cases of Ebola. In those vaccinated later there were 16 cases, according to the results published in the Lancet medical journal. 'Promising' The WHO says it is so far 100% effective, although that figure may change as more data is collected. Close contacts of Ebola patients in Guinea will now be vaccinated immediately. And since the vaccine has been shown to be safe, that process will also be extended to include children. Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) is involved with this research, and is part of a parallel trial for frontline healthcare workers. Medical director Bertrand Draguez said the Lancet results should spur instant action. "With such high efficacy, all affected countries should immediately start and multiply ring vaccinations to break chains of transmission and vaccinate all frontline workers to protect them." Marie-Paule Kieny, an assistant director general at the WHO told BBC News: "It is certainly promising. We have seen that where rings have been vaccinated, the transmission has stopped. "Prior to vaccination there were cases, cases, cases. The vaccine arrives and 10 days later the cases are flat. "It could be a game-changer because previously there was nothing, despite the disease being identified 40 years ago. "When there is a new outbreak this vaccine will be put to use to stop the outbreak as soon as possible to not have the terrible disaster we have now." More than 11,000 people have died from Ebola and nearly 28,000 have been infected. The sheer scale of the 2014-15 outbreak led to an unprecedented push on vaccines - and a decade's work has been condensed into around 10 months. The number of cases has fallen - and in the week up to July 26th 2015 there were just four cases in Guinea and three in Sierra Leone. Prof John Edmunds, from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, helped design the trial: "The development has been at an absolutely unprecedented speed. "This is very good news, these are very significant results, the epidemic is not over and this shows we have another potential weapon. "The trial is still continuing, these are interim results which need confirming, but there's now light at the end of the tunnel." Dr Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust medical charity, said this was a "remarkable result" and was the product of international collaboration. He added: "Our hope is that this vaccine will now help bring this epidemic to an end and be available for the inevitable future Ebola epidemics."

Reaching the overall crowdfunding goal of €50,000 will enable AMPION to set up a Fellowship Programme for a maximum amount of African start-ups and entrepreneurs with considerable funding and incubation. Commenting on the strategic partnerships, Fabian-Carlos Guhl Founder & MD, AMPION, said: "We are delighted to work with our new sponsors MTN, SAP, Microsoft, Inmarsat and Merck in Africa. Sponsoring and partnering with AMPION is an investment into the African mobile technology, start-ups and ICT space of tomorrow – and the creative entrepreneurs behind it. We are proud that world leading companies are convinced that our work is making a difference and decided to be a part of it."   What others are reading NDC must stay in opposition for 16 years – Kweku Baako Expect power in three hours - GRIDCO confirms 70% plunged in darkness Association of alcohol manufacturers commends FDA probe into Adonko Bitters saga Students get ‘free passco’ on Vodafone’s Instant Schools portal Latest Stories Akufo-Addo advocates for 24-hours opening of Ghana-Togo borders I’m sorry – Nii Noi begs Akufo-Addo A rewarding career in Corporate Communications Expect power in three hours - GRIDCO confirms 70% plunged in darkness Coventry graduate recounts life-changing commitment to tackling terrorism LIFESTYLE Doctors unhappy with queueing to use theatre ODD NEWS Father drinks his daughter's breast milk to help beat bowel cancer AUTOS The Junction Mall Auto Show TECHNOLOGY Galaxy S8: The Smartphone Evolution We Dreamt About OBITUARY Madam SARDIS EMMAROSE OSEW ELECTIONS EC holds district elections in Nkoranza after 2015 disruption Home News Politics Business Sports World News Opinion More Sections Entertainment Elections Health Odd News Automobile Technology Media Audio on Demand Photo Gallery Online Radio Videos On Demand Live TV Social RSS Feeds Twitter Facebook Youtube Google+ Instagram LinkedIn Myjoyonline Advertise Online Team Privacy Policy Services Contact us Feedback Our daily bread

Engine maker Cummins sent manufacturers and other industrial companies higher after reporting solid first-quarter earnings. A late slump took the price of oil to its lowest price in almost six months. Ford, General Motors, and Fiat Chrysler all fell after they said sales declined in April. Thanks to an upturn in the last few minutes of trading, the Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 2.84 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,391.17. The Dow Jones industrial average added 36.43 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,949.89. The Nasdaq composite set another record as it picked up 3.77 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,095.37. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks sank 8 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,399.36. Benchmark U.S. crude lost $1.18, or 2.4 percent, to $47.66 a barrel in New York. That's its lowest price since mid-November. Brent crude, used to price international oil, shed $1.06, or 2.1 percent, to $50.46 a barrel in London. Health-care stocks shook off an early loss. Merck climbed after it reported strong sales of newer medications including its cancer drug Keytruda and hepatitis C drug Zepatier, and its stock gained 32 cents to $62.70. Hospital chain Tenet Healthcare jumped $3.31, or 21.6 percent, to $18.66 after it agreed to sell three hospitals to HCA Holdings for $725 million and said it would rejoin insurer Humana's network. Consumer products companies slipped. Drugstore operator and pharmacy benefits manager CVS Health lost $2.96, or 3.6 percent, to $79 and agricultural company Archer-Daniels-Midland shed $4.06, or 8.9 percent, to $41.67 after earnings reports. Consumer reviews website Angie's List soared after it agreed to be bought by media company IAC/InterActiveCorp. IAC/InterActive wants to combine Angie's List with its HomeAdvisor.com business, which offers resources for home repair and improvement projects. The company will be called ANGI Homeservices. Gold rose $1.50 to $1,257 an ounce. Silver fell 1 cent to $16.83 an ounce. Copper lost 3 cents to $2.64 a pound. The dollar rose to 112 yen from 111.83. The euro rose to $1.0928 from $1.0906.

Johnson Updated 4:26 pm, Wednesday, May 3, 2017 Warranties and money-back guarantees, long used to entice buyers of products like hand tools and kitchen gadgets, are now being used to sell something more crucial: pricey new-generation drugs for diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and cancer. Deals being negotiated between drugmakers and the insurers who buy medicines now sometimes include extra rebates — or even full refunds — if drugs don’t help patients as expected. It’s part of an effort driven by insurers and government health programs to align the cost of care with the quality of care, and slow the relentless growth of prescription drug costs. Latest business videos “We’re spending less money on drugs that are less effective,” said Dr. Michael Sherman, chief medical officer for not-for-profit insurer Harvard Pilgrim, which has several of these deals and is negotiating more. Sherman says one-fourth of the money it spends on patient care goes to prescription drugs. For the patient, it doesn’t mean a check in the mail if cancer comes back after a round of treatment. But it does mean patients could get a drug that an insurer might otherwise be unwilling to pay for and that might help them. And insurers, who now can track how patients fare through electronic medical records, will be reducing wasteful spending and making at least a dent in overall health care costs. “It’s going to be part of the solution” to soaring drug prices, predicts Roger Longman, CEO of Real Endpoints, a company that assesses the value of medicines for drugmakers, insurers and other clients. Many drugs now top $100,000 per year or course of treatment, even though their benefits are unclear or only marginally better than cheaper, older drugs. Buyers of the new drugs, usually insurance companies, are hesitant to pay without assurance that they will help patients. Not only is that bad for patients, it makes insurers spend even more on complications and hospital stays if the drugs don’t work. As a result, insurers often restrict access to expensive new drugs. Sometimes that’s achieved by making patients pay more out of their own pockets, or making doctors wade through red tape to get authorization. Sometimes patients have to try cheaper drugs first, and only when they fail — and the patients’ health has deteriorated — are they allowed to get the pricey new drug. Pharmaceutical companies have an incentive here, too: These deals may help them sell more of the new drug they’ve spent hundreds of millions of dollars or more developing. For example, a new generation of injected cholesterol drugs does an impressive job of reducing bad cholesterol. But the drugs, Amgen’s Repatha and Sanofi’s Praluent, cost $14,000 a year, while cheap generic pills do a good job of lowering cholesterol for most people for $300 a year or less. Predictably, insurers often reject prescriptions for these drugs. So Amgen, trying to boost disappointing sales for a drug expected to be a huge seller, is offering full refunds to insurers if patients have a heart attack or stroke while taking its drug. On Tuesday, Amgen announced its first deal to do so, with Harvard Pilgrim. Sanofi has a contract with Cigna to pay extra rebates if patient cholesterol doesn’t fall as much as expected. “It demonstrates the fact that we are standing behind the value the product has, and we’re willing to put some money behind it,” said James Borneman, Sanofi’s head of strategic pricing. Some insurers are now demanding these deals, which are expected to become standard for some drugs: super-expensive medicines for cancer and rare diseases, and others that are used widely enough to cost insurers millions. In addition, the drugs must have a benefit that’s easy to measure, such as keeping kids with asthma out of the emergency room or preventing growth of cancerous tumors for a certain period. Cigna has been pursuing more of these types of deals after finding that some of its earlier efforts “met or exceeded expectations in terms of benefit to our customers, patients,” said Chris Bradbury, who heads Cigna’s prescription benefit program. One of its early deals, with Merck for its diabetes pills Januvia and Janumet, dates to 2009, with rebates pegged to how much patients lower blood sugar. “We keep re-signing that agreement, so I think they’re pretty satisfied,” said Bob McMahon, head of U.S. marketing at Merck, which also has such contracts with insurers and hospital systems covering an asthma medicine and is negotiating contracts for an infection drug. Other companies with such deals for one or more medicines include drugmakers Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, Novartis, Novo Nordisk and Roche’s Genentech unit; insurers Aetna and Priority Health, and prescription benefit manager Express Scripts. On their own, these deals are unlikely to reverse the persistent rise in medical spending, experts say. But they improve the chance that the money will at least go to treatments that work best — by making sure insurers and drug companies have something at stake along with the patient. “There’s a risk on both sides with these contracts,” said Dr. Mark Fendrick, director of the University of Michigan’s Center for Value-Based Insurance Design. “Both want to make sure they’ll get the outcome they want.” Linda A.

(Robert Dawson/Amgen via AP, File) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) Trenton, N.J. • Warranties and money-back guarantees, long used to entice buyers of products like hand tools and kitchen gadgets, are now being used to sell something more crucial: pricey new-generation drugs for diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and cancer. Deals being negotiated between drugmakers and the insurers who buy medicines now sometimes include extra rebates — or even full refunds — if drugs don't help patients as expected. It's part of an effort driven by insurers and government health programs to align the cost of care with the quality of care, and slow the relentless growth of prescription drug costs. VIDEOS TOP JOBS "We're spending less money on drugs that are less effective," said Dr. Michael Sherman, chief medical officer for the not-for-profit insurer Harvard Pilgrim, which has several of these deals and is negotiating more. Sherman says one-fourth of every dollar it spends on patient care goes to prescription drugs. For the patient, it doesn't mean a check in the mail if cancer comes back after a round of treatment. But it does mean patients could get a drug that an insurer might otherwise be unwilling to pay for and that might help them. And insurers, who now can track how patients fare through electronic medical records, will be reducing wasteful spending and making at least a dent in overall health care costs. "It's going to be part of the solution" to soaring drug prices, predicts Roger Longman, CEO of Real Endpoints, an analytics company that assesses the value of medicines for drugmakers, insurers and other clients. Many new drugs now top $100,000 per year or course of treatment, even though their benefits are unclear or only marginally better than cheaper, older drugs. Buyers of those new drugs, usually insurance companies, are hesitant to pay without assurance the drugs will help patients. Not only is that bad for patients, it makes insurers spend even more on complications and hospital stays if the drugs don't work. As a result, insurers often restrict access to expensive new drugs. Sometimes that's achieved by making patients pay more out of their own pockets, or making doctors wade through red tape to get authorization for a patient's medicine. Sometimes patients have to try cheaper drugs first, and only when they fail — and the patients' health has deteriorated — are they allowed to get the pricey new drug. Pharmaceutical companies have an incentive here, too: These deals may help them sell more of the new drug they've spent hundreds of millions of dollars or more developing. For example, a new generation of injected cholesterol drugs does an impressive job of reducing so-called bad cholesterol. But the drugs, Amgen's Repatha and Sanofi's Praluent, cost $14,000 a year, while cheap generic pills do a good job of lowering cholesterol for most people for $300 a year or less. Predictably, insurers often reject prescriptions for these drugs. So Amgen, trying to boost disappointing sales for a drug expected to be a huge seller, is offering full refunds to insurers if patients have a heart attack or stroke while taking its drug.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 3 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Global Option and Evaluation Partnership Terms and Agreements in Pharma, Biotech and Diagnostics 2010 – 2016 LONDON, May 3, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Download the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/4882436/ Description The Global Option and Evaluation Partnering Terms and Agreements in Pharma, Biotech and Diagnostics 2010-2017 report. This report provides details of the latest option and evaluation agreements announced in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic sectors. Fully revised and updated, the report provides details of option and evaluation agreements from 2010 to 2017. There are two major forms of deal term that allow a party to a deal to secure rights to an asset subject to a future event namely, option and evaluation. Evaluation agreements allow a party to the deal to obtain rights to a technology or compound, subject to a period of time to evaluate the quality, scope and applicability of the technology to its intended endpoint.Normally the technology is at an early stage and/or unproven and the partnering companywishes to assess the technology as part of the due diligence process in advance of signing a long term licensing agreement. Evaluation agreements have been a mainstay of technology licensing from the earliest days. An option agreement differs in that the option is often an integral part of an agreement already entered by the parties, providing the party with the option right to retain or extend certain rights to the technology already partnered. Option agreements are becoming increasingly popular as they create additional flexibility within a deal for additional rights that the parties do notwish to commit at the outset of the agreement. This report focuses on option and evaluation agreements and clauses within broader agreements between big pharma-big pharma, big pharma – smaller company, and smaller company-smaller company, providing a detailed insight into all such deals. The report provides a detailed understanding and analysis of how and why companies enter option and evaluation deals. The majority of deals are multicomponent whereby the licensor retains either a option and evaluation right to the resultant product of the research collaboration. There are also numerous pure option and evaluation deals whereby the products originator takes on a partner in order to advance the product or compound to a point where the licensee might seek to proceed to a licensing deal. Understanding the flexibility of a prospective partner’s negotiated deals terms provides critical insight into the negotiation process in terms of what you can expect to achieve during the negotiation of terms. Whilst many smaller companies will be seeking details of the payments clauses, the devil is in the detail in terms of how payments are triggered – contract documents provide this insight where press releases and databases do not. This report contains a comprehensive listing of all option and evaluation deals announced since 2010 as recorded in the Current Agreements deals and alliances database, including financial terms where available, plus links to online copies of actual option and evaluation contract documents as submitted to the Securities Exchange Commission by companies and their partners. Contract documents provide the answers to numerous questions about a prospective partner’s flexibility on a wide range of important issues, many of which will have a significant impact on each party’s ability to derive value from the deal. The initial chapters of this report provide an orientation of option and evaluation dealmaking and business activities. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the report, whilst chapter 2 provides an analysis of the trends in option and evaluation as well as a discussion on the merits of the type of deal. Chapter 3 provides an overview of the structure of option and evaluation deals. The chapter includes numerous case studies to enable understanding of both pure option and evaluation deals and multicomponent deals where option and evaluation forms a part. Chapter 4 provides a review of the leading option and evaluation deals since 2010. Deals are listed by headline value, signed by big pharma and big biotech and most active of all biopharma companies. Where the deal has an agreement contract published at the SEC a link provides online access to the contract via the Current Agreements deals and alliances database. Chapter 5 provides a comprehensive listing of the top 50 most active option and evaluation dealmaker companies.

Fully revised and updated, the report provides details of manufacturing and supply agreements from 2010 to 2017. The report provides a detailed understanding and analysis of how and why companies enter manufacturing and supply deals. A supply or manufacturing agreement is normally between a product manufacturer and product owner in which an owner outsources the manufacture and supply of its product(s) to the service company in a defined territory. Manufacturing and supply agreements provide a popular method of maximizing the value of a product launched into a market. The deals allow the product marketer to focus on its sales and marketing efforts whilst relying on a third party to manufacture and supply product on demand, enabling rapid response to market demands.

and Evaluation Deals in Pharma, Biotech and Diagnostics 2010-2017 report provides comprehensive understanding and unprecedented access to the option and evaluation partnering agreements entered into by the worlds leading biopharma companies News provided by ReportBuyer 03 May, 2017, 15:23 ET Share this article LONDON, May 3, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Download the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/4882436/ Description The Global Option and Evaluation Partnering Terms and Agreements in Pharma, Biotech and Diagnostics 2010-2017 report. This report provides details of the latest option and evaluation agreements announced in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic sectors. Fully revised and updated, the report provides details of option and evaluation agreements from 2010 to 2017. There are two major forms of deal term that allow a party to a deal to secure rights to an asset subject to a future event namely, option and evaluation. Evaluation agreements allow a party to the deal to obtain rights to a technology or compound, subject to a period of time to evaluate the quality, scope and applicability of the technology to its intended endpoint.Normally the technology is at an early stage and/or unproven and the partnering companywishes to assess the technology as part of the due diligence process in advance of signing a long term licensing agreement. Evaluation agreements have been a mainstay of technology licensing from the earliest days. An option agreement differs in that the option is often an integral part of an agreement already entered by the parties, providing the party with the option right to retain or extend certain rights to the technology already partnered. Option agreements are becoming increasingly popular as they create additional flexibility within a deal for additional rights that the parties do notwish to commit at the outset of the agreement. This report focuses on option and evaluation agreements and clauses within broader agreements between big pharma-big pharma, big pharma – smaller company, and smaller company-smaller company, providing a detailed insight into all such deals. The report provides a detailed understanding and analysis of how and why companies enter option and evaluation deals. The majority of deals are multicomponent whereby the licensor retains either a option and evaluation right to the resultant product of the research collaboration. There are also numerous pure option and evaluation deals whereby the products originator takes on a partner in order to advance the product or compound to a point where the licensee might seek to proceed to a licensing deal. Understanding the flexibility of a prospective partner's negotiated deals terms provides critical insight into the negotiation process in terms of what you can expect to achieve during the negotiation of terms. Whilst many smaller companies will be seeking details of the payments clauses, the devil is in the detail in terms of how payments are triggered – contract documents provide this insight where press releases and databases do not. This report contains a comprehensive listing of all option and evaluation deals announced since 2010 as recorded in the Current Agreements deals and alliances database, including financial terms where available, plus links to online copies of actual option and evaluation contract documents as submitted to the Securities Exchange Commission by companies and their partners. Contract documents provide the answers to numerous questions about a prospective partner's flexibility on a wide range of important issues, many of which will have a significant impact on each party's ability to derive value from the deal. The initial chapters of this report provide an orientation of option and evaluation dealmaking and business activities. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the report, whilst chapter 2 provides an analysis of the trends in option and evaluation as well as a discussion on the merits of the type of deal. Chapter 3 provides an overview of the structure of option and evaluation deals. The chapter includes numerous case studies to enable understanding of both pure option and evaluation deals and multicomponent deals where option and evaluation forms a part. Chapter 4 provides a review of the leading option and evaluation deals since 2010. Deals are listed by headline value, signed by big pharma and big biotech and most active of all biopharma companies. Where the deal has an agreement contract published at the SEC a link provides online access to the contract via the Current Agreements deals and alliances database. Chapter 5 provides a comprehensive listing of the top 50 most active option and evaluation dealmaker companies. Each deal title links via Current Agreements deals and alliances database to an online version of the full deal record, and where available, the actual contract document, providing easy access to each deal record on demand. Chapter 6 provides a comprehensive and detailed review of option and evaluation deals signed and announced since 2010 where a contract document is available. Contract documents provide an indepth insight into the actual deal terms agreed between the parties with respect to the option and evaluation deal. In addition the report includes a series of appendices containing a comprehensive listing of all option and evaluation deals announced since 2010. Each listing is organized as an appendix by company A-Z, stage of development at signing, and therapeutic area. Each deal title links via hyperlink to an online version of the deal record including, where available, the actual contract document. The report includes deals announced by hundreds of life science companies including big pharma such as Abbott, Abbvie, Actavis, Amgen, Astellas, AstraZeneca, Baxter, Bayer, Biogen Idec, BMS, Celgene, Eisai, Eli Lilly, Gilead, GSK, J&J, Kyowa Hakko, Merck, Mitsubishi, Mylan, Novartis, Pfizer, Roche, Sanofi, Shire, Takeda, Teva, and Valeant, amongst many others.

Fully revised and updated, the report provides details of manufacturing and supply agreements from 2010 to 2017. The report provides a detailed understanding and analysis of how and why companies enter manufacturing and supply deals. A supply or manufacturing agreement is normally between a product manufacturer and product owner in which an owner outsources the manufacture and supply of its product(s) to the service company in a defined territory. Manufacturing and supply agreements provide a popular method of maximizing the value of a product launched into a market. The deals allow the product marketer to focus on its sales and marketing efforts whilst relying on a third party to manufacture and supply product on demand, enabling rapid response to market demands. It also ensures that the marketer does not need to invest in costly infrastructure and expertise ahead of knowing whether the product will be successful or sustainable. Understanding the flexibility of a prospective partner's negotiated deals terms provides critical insight into the negotiation process in terms of what you can expect to achieve during the negotiation of terms.

This report provides details of the latest option and evaluation agreements announced in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic sectors. Fully revised and updated, the report provides details of option and evaluation agreements from 2010 to 2017. There are two major forms of deal term that allow a party to a deal to secure rights to an asset subject to a future event namely, option and evaluation. Evaluation agreements allow a party to the deal to obtain rights to a technology or compound, subject to a period of time to evaluate the quality, scope and applicability of the technology to its intended endpoint.Normally the technology is at an early stage and/or unproven and the partnering companywishes to assess the technology as part of the due diligence process in advance of signing a long term licensing agreement. Evaluation agreements have been a mainstay of technology licensing from the earliest days. An option agreement differs in that the option is often an integral part of an agreement already entered by the parties, providing the party with the option right to retain or extend certain rights to the technology already partnered. Option agreements are becoming increasingly popular as they create additional flexibility within a deal for additional rights that the parties do notwish to commit at the outset of the agreement. This report focuses on option and evaluation agreements and clauses within broader agreements between big pharma-big pharma, big pharma – smaller company, and smaller company-smaller company, providing a detailed insight into all such deals. The report provides a detailed understanding and analysis of how and why companies enter option and evaluation deals. The majority of deals are multicomponent whereby the licensor retains either a option and evaluation right to the resultant product of the research collaboration. There are also numerous pure option and evaluation deals whereby the products originator takes on a partner in order to advance the product or compound to a point where the licensee might seek to proceed to a licensing deal. Understanding the flexibility of a prospective partner's negotiated deals terms provides critical insight into the negotiation process in terms of what you can expect to achieve during the negotiation of terms. Whilst many smaller companies will be seeking details of the payments clauses, the devil is in the detail in terms of how payments are triggered – contract documents provide this insight where press releases and databases do not.

JOHNSON - 5/3/17 2:50 PM TRENTON, N.J. — Warranties and money-back guarantees, long used to entice buyers of products like hand tools and kitchen gadgets, are now being used to sell something more crucial: pricey new-generation drugs for diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and cancer. Deals being negotiated between drugmakers and the insurers who buy medicines now sometimes include extra rebates — or even full refunds — if drugs don’t help patients as expected. It’s part of an effort driven by insurers and government health programs to align the cost of care with the quality of care, and slow the relentless growth of prescription drug costs. “We’re spending less money on drugs that are less effective,” said Dr. Michael Sherman, chief medical officer for the not-for-profit insurer Harvard Pilgrim, which has several of these deals and is negotiating more. Sherman says one-fourth of every dollar it spends on patient care goes to prescription drugs. For the patient, it doesn’t mean a check in the mail if cancer comes back after a round of treatment. But it does mean patients could get a drug that an insurer might otherwise be unwilling to pay for and that might help them. And insurers, who now can track how patients fare through electronic medical records, will be reducing wasteful spending and making at least a dent in overall health care costs. “It’s going to be part of the solution” to soaring drug prices, predicts Roger Longman, CEO of Real Endpoints, an analytics company that assesses the value of medicines for drugmakers, insurers and other clients. Many new drugs now top $100,000 per year or course of treatment, even though their benefits are unclear or only marginally better than cheaper, older drugs. Buyers of those new drugs, usually insurance companies, are hesitant to pay without assurance the drugs will help patients. Not only is that bad for patients, it makes insurers spend even more on complications and hospital stays if the drugs don’t work. As a result, insurers often restrict access to expensive new drugs. Sometimes that’s achieved by making patients pay more out of their own pockets, or making doctors wade through red tape to get authorization for a patient’s medicine. Sometimes patients have to try cheaper drugs first, and only when they fail — and the patients’ health has deteriorated — are they allowed to get the pricey new drug. Pharmaceutical companies have an incentive here, too: These deals may help them sell more of the new drug they’ve spent hundreds of millions of dollars or more developing. For example, a new generation of injected cholesterol drugs does an impressive job of reducing so-called bad cholesterol. But the drugs, Amgen’s Repatha and Sanofi’s Praluent, cost $14,000 a year, while cheap generic pills do a good job of lowering cholesterol for most people for $300 a year or less. Predictably, insurers often reject prescriptions for these drugs. So Amgen, trying to boost disappointing sales for a drug expected to be a huge seller, is offering full refunds to insurers if patients have a heart attack or stroke while taking its drug. On Tuesday, Amgen announced its first deal to do so, with Harvard Pilgrim. Sanofi has a contract with insurer Cigna to pay extra rebates if patient cholesterol doesn’t fall as much as expected. “It demonstrates the fact that we are standing behind the value the product has, and we’re willing to put some money behind it,” said James Borneman, Sanofi’s head of strategic pricing. Some insurers are now demanding these deals, which are expected to become standard for some drugs: super-expensive medicines for cancer and rare diseases, and others that are used widely enough to cost insurers millions. In addition, the drugs must have a benefit that’s easy to measure, such as keeping kids with asthma out of the emergency room or preventing growth of cancerous tumors for a certain period. Cigna has been pursuing more of these types of deals after finding that some of its earlier efforts “met or exceeded expectations in terms of benefit to our customers, patients,” said Chris Bradbury, who heads Cigna’s prescription benefit program. One of its early deals, with drugmaker Merck for its diabetes pills Januvia and Janumet, dates to 2009, with rebates pegged to how much patients lower blood sugar. “We keep re-signing that agreement, so I think they’re pretty satisfied,” said Bob McMahon, head of U.S. marketing at Merck, which also has such contracts with insurers and hospital systems covering an asthma medicine and is negotiating contracts for an infection drug. Other companies with such deals for one or more medicines include drugmakers Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, Novartis, Novo Nordisk and Roche’s Genentech unit; insurers Aetna and Priority Health, and prescription benefit manager Express Scripts. On their own, these deals are unlikely to reverse the persistent rise in medical spending, experts say. But they improve the chance that the money will at least go to treatments that work best — by making sure insurers and drug companies have something at stake along with the patient. “There’s a risk on both sides with these contracts,” said Dr. Mark Fendrick, director of the University of Michigan’s Center for Value-Based Insurance Design. “Both want to make sure they’ll get the outcome they want.” Follow Linda A.

JOHNSON AP Medical Writer May 3, 2017 Updated 8 hrs ago 0 Robert Dawson FILE - This undated file image provided by Amgen Inc. shows the cholesterol-lowering drug Repatha. Warranties and money-back guarantees, long used to entice buyers of products like outdoor clothing and appliances, are now being used to sell something more vital: pricey new-generation drugs for diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and cancer. Drugmaker Amgen announced a deal the first week of May 2017 with insurer Harvard Pilgrim that will give the insurer a refund if a patient has a heart attack while on its $14,000-a-year cholesterol drug, Repatha. (Robert Dawson/Amgen via AP, File) TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — Warranties and money-back guarantees, long used to entice buyers of products like hand tools and kitchen gadgets, are now being used to sell something more crucial: pricey new-generation drugs for diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and cancer. Deals being negotiated between drugmakers and the insurers who buy medicines now sometimes include extra rebates — or even full refunds — if drugs don't help patients as expected. It's part of an effort driven by insurers and government health programs to align the cost of care with the quality of care, and slow the relentless growth of prescription drug costs. "We're spending less money on drugs that are less effective," said Dr. Michael Sherman, chief medical officer for the not-for-profit insurer Harvard Pilgrim, which has several of these deals and is negotiating more. Sherman says one-fourth of every dollar it spends on patient care goes to prescription drugs. For the patient, it doesn't mean a check in the mail if cancer comes back after a round of treatment. But it does mean patients could get a drug that an insurer might otherwise be unwilling to pay for and that might help them. And insurers, who now can track how patients fare through electronic medical records, will be reducing wasteful spending and making at least a dent in overall health care costs. "It's going to be part of the solution" to soaring drug prices, predicts Roger Longman, CEO of Real Endpoints, an analytics company that assesses the value of medicines for drugmakers, insurers and other clients. Many new drugs now top $100,000 per year or course of treatment, even though their benefits are unclear or only marginally better than cheaper, older drugs. Buyers of those new drugs, usually insurance companies, are hesitant to pay without assurance the drugs will help patients. Not only is that bad for patients, it makes insurers spend even more on complications and hospital stays if the drugs don't work. As a result, insurers often restrict access to expensive new drugs. Sometimes that's achieved by making patients pay more out of their own pockets, or making doctors wade through red tape to get authorization for a patient's medicine. Sometimes patients have to try cheaper drugs first, and only when they fail — and the patients' health has deteriorated — are they allowed to get the pricey new drug. Pharmaceutical companies have an incentive here, too: These deals may help them sell more of the new drug they've spent hundreds of millions of dollars or more developing. For example, a new generation of injected cholesterol drugs does an impressive job of reducing so-called bad cholesterol. But the drugs, Amgen's Repatha and Sanofi's Praluent, cost $14,000 a year, while cheap generic pills do a good job of lowering cholesterol for most people for $300 a year or less. Predictably, insurers often reject prescriptions for these drugs. So Amgen, trying to boost disappointing sales for a drug expected to be a huge seller, is offering full refunds to insurers if patients have a heart attack or stroke while taking its drug. On Tuesday, Amgen announced its first deal to do so, with Harvard Pilgrim. Sanofi has a contract with insurer Cigna to pay extra rebates if patient cholesterol doesn't fall as much as expected. "It demonstrates the fact that we are standing behind the value the product has, and we're willing to put some money behind it," said James Borneman, Sanofi's head of strategic pricing. Some insurers are now demanding these deals, which are expected to become standard for some drugs: super-expensive medicines for cancer and rare diseases, and others that are used widely enough to cost insurers millions. In addition, the drugs must have a benefit that's easy to measure, such as keeping kids with asthma out of the emergency room or preventing growth of cancerous tumors for a certain period. Cigna has been pursuing more of these types of deals after finding that some of its earlier efforts "met or exceeded expectations in terms of benefit to our customers, patients," said Chris Bradbury, who heads Cigna's prescription benefit program. One of its early deals, with drugmaker Merck for its diabetes pills Januvia and Janumet, dates to 2009, with rebates pegged to how much patients lower blood sugar. "We keep re-signing that agreement, so I think they're pretty satisfied," said Bob McMahon, head of U.S. marketing at Merck, which also has such contracts with insurers and hospital systems covering an asthma medicine and is negotiating contracts for an infection drug. Other companies with such deals for one or more medicines include drugmakers Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, Novartis, Novo Nordisk and Roche's Genentech unit; insurers Aetna and Priority Health, and prescription benefit manager Express Scripts. On their own, these deals are unlikely to reverse the persistent rise in medical spending, experts say. But they improve the chance that the money will at least go to treatments that work best — by making sure insurers and drug companies have something at stake along with the patient. "There's a risk on both sides with these contracts," said Dr. Mark Fendrick, director of the University of Michigan's Center for Value-Based Insurance Design. "Both want to make sure they'll get the outcome they want." ___ Follow Linda A. Johnson at https://twitter.com/LindaJ_onPharma . Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

 What it's like to get the crazy futuristic birth control that's implanted into your arm Caroline Praderio, INSIDER May 3, 2017, 11:44 AM 23 facebook linkedin twitter email print There's super-effective birth control in there. Caroline Praderio/INSIDER The INSIDER Summary: IUDs aren't the only long-lasting, effective, reversible method of birth control. The birth control implant, placed under the skin of the arm, is more than 99% effective and lasts up to four years. INSIDER asked a gynecologist and three implant users about all the pros and cons of the device. There's been a lot of buzz lately about IUDs — tiny devices that sit in the uterus and offer effective birth control for up to 10 years. But if you're looking for low-hassle, long-lasting, reversible contraception, it's important to know that IUDs aren't the only game in town.  Meet the birth control implant: The matchstick-sized flexible rod that's placed under the skin of the arm, where it slowly releases hormones that prevent pregnancy. The implant and the IUD are the most effective forms of reversible birth control out there, according to the CDC.  Want to know if the implant's a good choice for your body? INSIDER interviewed a gynecologist and three real women who've used it to learn more about its pros and cons. Here's what you need to know: The implant is more than 99% effective and lasts four years.  A closeup of the birth control implant. Shutterstock Compare that to the pill, which is only 91% effective with typical use. And once the implant is inserted, you don't have to do anything else — it just works. The active ingredient is a hormone called etonogestrel.  In the US, the implant is sold under the brand name Nexplanon. The manufacturer says that it lasts for three years, but new data show that you can actually use it for four years, according to Dr. Susan E. Pesci, MD, clinical instructor, ob/gyn, and family planning specialist in the Montefiore Health System.  "The initial studies that were done to validate the implant only tested it for three years," Pesci told INSIDER. "But we have plenty of data now — well designed studies with large numbers of patients — that have found that it's completely reliable beyond three years." But if you want to get pregnant (or you just don't like it), a doctor can easily remove the implant at any time.  The insertion can be painful — but it's fast.  A woman in the Philippines receives a birth control implant. Reuters/Erik de Castro The implant is placed subdermally — under the skin — in a quick procedure at the doctor's office.  "The doctor numbed my arm, [then] they used this small tool to slit my skin and slide the implant in," Celine, a 24-year-old woman, who's had the implant for 11 months, told INSIDER. "[My doctor] said a lot of patients faint during insertion, and she asked me about 10 times if I was okay. [It] took probably two minutes in total." She also said it left a small scar. Unfortunately it's hard to say exactly how painful the insertion is (or if you'll faint). Accounts of the experience vary from person to person.  "On a scale of one to 10, the pain was a seven, but it was a stab that lasted for a few seconds," Lauren, a 23-year-old who had the implant for about 20 months, told INSIDER. "[It] didn't really hurt," a 27-year-old teacher (who asked to remain anonymous) told INSIDER. "[I] had a nasty bruise for a week or two after and felt mildly sore day of." You may have unpleasant side effects.  Weight gain is a possible side effect of the implant. Sophia Charlotte / Flickr The most common side effect of the implant is a change in your monthly bleeding pattern. You might get irregular bleeding or spotting, and your period can get longer, shorter, or disappear altogether. The Nexplanon site says about 1 in 10 women stop using the implant because of changes like these. There is a chance that there will be complications with the insertion. Other common side effects are mood swings, weight gain, headache, acne, and a depressed mood. This is another way that the implant differs from the IUD.  In hormonal IUDs, the hormone acts locally, right inside the uterus, and very little of it gets into your bloodstream. That's not so with the implant.  "The implant is placed subdermally and the hormone then has to travel through the bloodstream in order to reach its target organ, which is the uterus," Pesci explained. "As it courses through the body it has the ability to affect other organs and other systems on its way. That's why it can affect the skin, it can affect metabolism, things like that." The women INSIDER spoke with had varied side effects.  Associated Press/Merck The 27-year-old teacher, for instance, said she couldn't confidently attribute any side effects to the implant itself. "Like many birth controls, there was a weight gain warning," she said. "I have gained weight, but I've also gotten older and my lifestyle is different." "I have only had my period once in almost a full year," Celine said. "There were also noticeable changes in my sex drive for the first 3 months or so, but then everything leveled out." "Side effects I experienced included a 15-pound weight gain, extreme sensitivity, easy fluctuations of mood, general fatigue, and light or no periods," Lauren said. "Other than my unpleasant weight gain, I was crying a lot. I'm a sensitive person to begin with, but a lot of things that I didn't know I really cared about, got me quite worked up [...] On the plus side, I barely ever got periods, and if I did, it was extremely light." (She decided to have her implant removed after almost two years.) But remember that not everyone will have a negative experience with the implant. And for some women, Pesci said, the assurance of really effective contraception is worth potential side effects.  The implant has another major plus: You can feel it under the skin.  The implant is almost impossible to notice just by looking, but it's easy to feel. With the implant, Pesci said, "women have this long-acting method that they can touch. They can feel it every single day and they know that it's there and that they're protected. It's comforting to a lot of women."  IUDs, by contrast, are harder to feel — you've got to learn how to reach up to the cervix and feel the strings, and you might worry about whether it's moved out of place. Some people should not use the implant.  "If a woman values having a period and having a regular period, that's the only person that I would probably counsel away from the implant," Pesci said. "Because we can’t tell her with 100% certainty that she will have a period or a predictable period." Women who have liver disease, liver tumors, hormone-responsive breast cancer or a history of blood clots also shouldn't use the device. The women INSIDER interviewed gave mixed reviews of their overall implant experience.  Shutterstock "It makes your life so easy," the 27-year-old teacher said. "No more pain from periods or money spent on feminine hygiene products! I think it's easy to see if you want kids in the next 3 years or not, so this is a perfect longer term solution." She plans to get a new implant once her current one expires later this year. Lauren — the woman who experienced weight gain and mood swings after getting the implant — said she'd still recommend it, as long as women are aware of the possible side effects from the get go. Celine said she'd recommend the implant only if an IUD wasn't an option. "I've toyed with getting the implant removed multiple times, especially in the first few months," she said.  The bottom line: Always talk with your doctor about what birth control method is best in the context of your overall health. The implant might turn out to be your perfect fit, and it might not. The good news is that there are plenty approved contraceptives to choose from.

Warranties and money-back guarantees, long used to entice buyers of products like outdoor clothing and appliances, are now being used to sell something more vital: pricey new-generation drugs for diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and cancer. Drugmaker Amgen announced a deal the first week of May 2017 with insurer Harvard Pilgrim that will give the insurer a refund if a patient has a heart attack while on its $14,000-a-year cholesterol drug, Repatha. (Robert Dawson/Amgen via AP, File) By: Linda A. Johnson The Associated Press Published on TRENTON, N.J. — Warranties and money-back guarantees, long used to entice buyers of products like hand tools and kitchen gadgets, are now being used to sell something more crucial: pricey new-generation drugs for diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and cancer. Deals being negotiated between drugmakers and the insurers who buy medicines now sometimes include extra rebates — or even full refunds — if drugs don't help patients as expected. It's part of an effort driven by insurers and government health programs to align the cost of care with the quality of care, and slow the relentless growth of prescription drug costs. "We're spending less money on drugs that are less effective," said Dr. Michael Sherman, chief medical officer for the not-for-profit insurer Harvard Pilgrim, which has several of these deals and is negotiating more. Sherman says one-fourth of every dollar it spends on patient care goes to prescription drugs. For the patient, it doesn't mean a check in the mail if cancer comes back after a round of treatment. But it does mean patients could get a drug that an insurer might otherwise be unwilling to pay for and that might help them. And insurers, who now can track how patients fare through electronic medical records, will be reducing wasteful spending and making at least a dent in overall health care costs. "It's going to be part of the solution" to soaring drug prices, predicts Roger Longman, CEO of Real Endpoints, an analytics company that assesses the value of medicines for drugmakers, insurers and other clients. Many new drugs now top $100,000 per year or course of treatment, even though their benefits are unclear or only marginally better than cheaper, older drugs. Buyers of those new drugs, usually insurance companies, are hesitant to pay without assurance the drugs will help patients. Not only is that bad for patients, it makes insurers spend even more on complications and hospital stays if the drugs don't work. As a result, insurers often restrict access to expensive new drugs. Sometimes that's achieved by making patients pay more out of their own pockets, or making doctors wade through red tape to get authorization for a patient's medicine. Sometimes patients have to try cheaper drugs first, and only when they fail — and the patients' health has deteriorated — are they allowed to get the pricey new drug. Pharmaceutical companies have an incentive here, too: These deals may help them sell more of the new drug they've spent hundreds of millions of dollars or more developing. For example, a new generation of injected cholesterol drugs does an impressive job of reducing so-called bad cholesterol. But the drugs, Amgen's Repatha and Sanofi's Praluent, cost $14,000 a year, while cheap generic pills do a good job of lowering cholesterol for most people for $300 a year or less. Predictably, insurers often reject prescriptions for these drugs. So Amgen, trying to boost disappointing sales for a drug expected to be a huge seller, is offering full refunds to insurers if patients have a heart attack or stroke while taking its drug. On Tuesday, Amgen announced its first deal to do so, with Harvard Pilgrim. Sanofi has a contract with insurer Cigna to pay extra rebates if patient cholesterol doesn't fall as much as expected. "It demonstrates the fact that we are standing behind the value the product has, and we're willing to put some money behind it," said James Borneman, Sanofi's head of strategic pricing. Some insurers are now demanding these deals, which are expected to become standard for some drugs: super-expensive medicines for cancer and rare diseases, and others that are used widely enough to cost insurers millions. In addition, the drugs must have a benefit that's easy to measure, such as keeping kids with asthma out of the emergency room or preventing growth of cancerous tumors for a certain period. Cigna has been pursuing more of these types of deals after finding that some of its earlier efforts "met or exceeded expectations in terms of benefit to our customers, patients," said Chris Bradbury, who heads Cigna's prescription benefit program. One of its early deals, with drugmaker Merck for its diabetes pills Januvia and Janumet, dates to 2009, with rebates pegged to how much patients lower blood sugar. "We keep re-signing that agreement, so I think they're pretty satisfied," said Bob McMahon, head of U.S. marketing at Merck, which also has such contracts with insurers and hospital systems covering an asthma medicine and is negotiating contracts for an infection drug. Other companies with such deals for one or more medicines include drugmakers Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, Novartis, Novo Nordisk and Roche's Genentech unit; insurers Aetna and Priority Health, and prescription benefit manager Express Scripts. On their own, these deals are unlikely to reverse the persistent rise in medical spending, experts say. But they improve the chance that the money will at least go to treatments that work best — by making sure insurers and drug companies have something at stake along with the patient. "There's a risk on both sides with these contracts," said Dr. Mark Fendrick, director of the University of Michigan's Center for Value-Based Insurance Design. "Both want to make sure they'll get the outcome they want." ___ Follow Linda A. Johnson at https://twitter.com/LindaJ_onPharma .

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 3 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Global Bipolar Disorder Market Analysis, Trends and Forecast by 2017 – 2025 Albany, NY — (SBWIRE) — 05/03/2017 — Bipolar disorder, commonly known as manic depression, is a type of mental illness which is characterized by mood swings. Mood episodes are of two types: manic and depressive episodes. The changes in the mental state bring out sudden high or low moods in a person. An individual suffering from bipolar disorder can be happy, joyful, and energized at a particular moment and can also be sad, hopeless, and sluggish at the next moment. This mental illness is termed as bipolar disorder due to these different moods or two poles of mood. Through many research activities, it is observed that certain genes are responsible for the development of bipolar disorder. Individuals with a family history of bipolar disorder are most likely to develop the illness. These kind of mood episodes can hamper the image of an individual at a school or at a job or even in the society. Obtain Report Details @ http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/bipolar-disorder-treatment-market.html Increase in awareness about diagnosis and treatment of bipolar disorder and unmet needs in the treatment of the disorder are the major drivers for the growth of the market. Increasing acceptance of society regarding mental illness is encouraging individuals to get treated. In addition, growth in technological advancement in identifying genetic disorders and increase in treatment options for genetic disorders are major drivers of the market growth. Government initiatives such as launch of Bipolar Disorder Phenome Database, funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), provide complete information regarding signs and symptoms of the illness. This factor has further contributed to the growth of the market. However, factors such as stringent regulatory frameworks, side effects of anticonvulsants, and limited number of approved anticonvulsants hamper the growth of the market. The global bipolar disorder market is segmented based on types of bipolar disorder, drug class, mechanism of action, and geography. Based on types of bipolar disorder, the market is classified into bipolar I disorder, which is mania or mixed episode; bipolar II disorder, which is hypomania and depression; and cyclothymia, which is hypomania and mild depression. According to drug class, the market is segmented into mood stabilizers, anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, antidepressants, and anti-anxiety drugs. In terms of mechanism of action, the market is segmented into selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, benzodiazepines, beta blockers, and others. Geographically, the global bipolar market is distributed over North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Middle East & Africa. North America dominates the global bipolar disorder market due to increased awareness and larger availability of treatment options. In the region, the U.S. has a significant market share in terms of revenue, followed by Canada. Europe is the second leading region, contributing to the growth of the market in terms of revenue, with the U.K. and Germany having major share of the market. Asia Pacific is a highly potential market with emerging countries such as India and China. The market in the region is expected to expand at a high CAGR during the forecast period. Increase in awareness about the disease in countries such as India is likely to boost the growth of the market. Latin America and Middle East & Africa are expected to contribute highly to the growth of the market due to improving economy and rising awareness about the mental illness. Key players operating in the global bipolar disorder market include Abbott Laboratories, Bristol-Myers Squibb, AstraZeneca plc, Eli Lilly and Company, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Merck & Co., Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer Inc., Cephalon Inc., Gedeon Richter plc, H. Lundbeck A/S, Otsuka America Pharmaceutical Inc., Repligen Corporation, and Validus Pharmaceuticals LLC. The report offers a comprehensive evaluation of the market.

One of its early deals, with drugmaker Merck for its diabetes pills Januvia and Janumet, dates to 2009, with rebates pegged to how much patients lower blood sugar. “We keep re-signing that agreement, so I think they’re pretty satisfied,” said Bob McMahon, head of U.S. marketing at Merck, which also has such contracts with insurers and hospital systems covering an asthma medicine and is negotiating contracts for an infection drug. Other companies with such deals for one or more medicines include drugmakers Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, Novartis, Novo Nordisk and Roche’s Genentech unit; insurers Aetna and Priority Health, and prescription benefit manager Express Scripts. On their own, these deals are unlikely to reverse the persistent rise in medical spending, experts say. But they improve the chance that the money will at least go to treatments that work best — by making sure insurers and drug companies have something at stake along with the patient. “There’s a risk on both sides with these contracts,” said Dr. Mark Fendrick, director of the University of Michigan’s Center for Value-Based Insurance Design. “Both want to make sure they’ll get the outcome they want.” ___ Follow Linda A.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Here's Why ImmunoGen Rose 10.7% in April It was a quiet month for the beleaguered biotech, but a few actions by Wall Street analysts caused the share price to climb by double digits. Brian Feroldi (TMFTypeoh) May 3, 2017 at 11:10AM What happened Shares of ImmunoGen (NASDAQ:IMGN), a clinical-stage biotech focused on antibody-drug conjugates that are used to treat cancer, jumped more than 10% during April, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence .  So what ImmunoGen didn't have a lot of news to share with investors during that month that could help to explain its rise. However, the company did receive some attention from Wall Street that probably affected its share price. It mid-April, Leerink Partners upgraded the ImmunoGen's stock to "outperform" and gave the share price an $8 target. A few days later, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets downgraded the company's stock to "sector perform" and dropped the price target from $18 to $7. That might sound like bad news, but the $7 target price is still more than 50% higher than where shares were trading at the time.  Image source: Getty Images. Now what ImmunoGen's stock has been on an absolute tear in 2017. Shares have rallied more than 109% since the start of the year as the company comes closer to releasing data from its phase 1b/2 FORWARD II trial. This study is testing ImmunoGen's lead drug, mirvetuximab soravtansine, in combination with a handful of other cancer drugs, such as Roche's Avastin and Merck's Keytruda. The company will also report pooled data from over 100 ovarian cancer patients who were treated in multiple phase 1 trials testing mirvetuximab soravtansine as a monotherapy. These two data releases will help give investors a sense of how its phase 3 FORWARD I trial is going, which is a long-term trial that is evaluating mirvetuximab soravtansine in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. These upcoming catalysts might have captured Wall Street's attention, but I personally feel that ImmonoGen's stock is still far too risky to touch. That's why I have no plans to chase this red-hot stock with my capital.  Brian Feroldi has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool recommends ImmunoGen.

Engine maker Cummins sent manufacturers and other industrial companies higher after reporting solid first-quarter earnings. A late slump took the price of oil to its lowest price in almost six months. Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler all fell after they said sales declined in April. Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Cornerstone Financial Partners, said auto sales have weakened because lenders are growing a bit hesitant to make loans to help people buy cars. “It’s more a story specific to the auto sector as opposed to a slowdown in consumer spending,” he said. Thanks to an upturn in the last few minutes of trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 2.84 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,391.17. The Dow Jones industrial average added 36.43 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,949.89. The Nasdaq composite set another record as it picked up 3.76 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,095.37. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks sank 8 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,399.36. The six largest auto makers in the U.S. all said their sales fell in April. Vehicle sales have set records the last few years and analysts are worried the streak is ending and car companies are relying too much on discounts and incentives to keep their sales numbers high. Ford lost 50 cents, or 4.4 percent, to $10.92 and GM gave up $1, or 2.9 percent, to $33.20 while Fiat Chrysler skidded 49 cents, or 4.3 percent, to $10.92. Car retailers, rental companies and parts suppliers slipped as well. Industrial companies made some of the biggest gains. Cummins reported a far bigger profit and better sales than analysts expected, and its stock climbed $9.23, or 6.1 percent, to $160.56. The company said demand from construction and mining sales grew compared with the same period a year ago, but truck production in North America fell. Benchmark U.S. crude lost $1.18, or 2.4 percent, to $47.66 a barrel in New York. That’s its lowest price since mid-November. Brent crude, used to price international oils, shed $1.06, or 2.1 percent, to $50.46 a barrel in London. Health care stocks shook off an early loss. Merck climbed after it reported strong sales of newer medications including its cancer drug Keytruda and hepatitis C drug Zepatier, and its stock gained 32 cents to $62.70. Hospital chain Tenet Healthcare jumped $3.31, or 21.6 percent, to $18.66 after it agreed to sell three hospitals to HCA Holdings for $725 million and said it will rejoin insurer Humana’s network. Technology stocks rose further. The S&P 500’s technology index, which includes 69 major companies, is at its highest levels since March 2000, the peak of the dot-com boom. However it’s still well below the records it set back then. Apple gained 93 cents to $147.51 during regular trading. Its stock lost 2 percent in aftermarket trading after the company reported results that included slightly disappointing quarterly iPhone sales. Its guidance also wasn’t as strong as investors hoped. Consumer products companies slipped. Drugstore operator and pharmacy benefits manager CVS Health lost $2.96, or 3.6 percent, to $79 and agricultural company Archer-Daniels-Midland shed $4.06, or 8.9 percent, to $41.67 after their respective earnings reports. Consumer reviews website Angie’s List soared after it agreed to be bought by media company IAC/InterActiveCorp. IAC/InterActive wants to combine Angie’s List with its HomeAdvisor.com business, which offers resources for home repair and improvement projects. The company will be called ANGI Homeservices. IAC/InterActive offered to buy Angie’s List in 2015 for $8.75 a share, which Angie’s List said was too low. On Tuesday its stock jumped $3.6, or 61.5 percent, to $9.51 and IAC/InterActive rose $12.05, or 14.3 percent, to $96.24. Health insurer Molina Healthcare fired CEO Mario Molina and chief financial officer John Molina, citing the company’s poor financial performance. The Medicaid administrator was founded by their father, David Molina, who died in 1996. The stock jumped $8.95, or 17.6 percent, to $59.75. Bond prices headed higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.28 percent from 2.32 percent. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline dipped 1 cent to $1.51 a gallon. Heating oil lost 2 cents to $1.47 a gallon. Natural gas gave up 2 cents to $3.20 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold rose $1.50 to $1,257 an ounce. Silver fell 1 cent to $16.83 an ou     Tags: percent, sales, after, companies, company, cents, Other stories from today: GOP targets law enacted after ’08 financial meltdown Stocks scuffle as slowing auto sales cause worry Shakeup at Molina, CEO and CFO, sons of founder are out     Print this Page  |  << Back            Daily Journal Quick Poll   Do you think the Affordable Care Act should be repealed?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 3 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman MEA Veterinary Vaccines Market will soar below average to reach US$ 422.9 million value by 2026-end Animal breeding remains to be one of the most fundamental agricultural activity facilitating the growth of food & beverage industry in the Middle East. Milk and meat are some of the common raw materials derived from animal husbandry activities carried out in the MEA region. Future Market Insights recently published its research report on the veterinary vaccines market in the Middle East, which stated that – rising demand for food security in the Middle East, collaborative manufacturing measures witnessed among foodmakers and suppliers, and the absence of appropriate health tracking facilities for animals are factoring the growth in demand for veterinary vaccines. Future Market Insights projects that the MEA veterinary vaccines market, which is presently valued at US$ 267.3 million, will soar below average to reach US$ 422.9 million value by 2026-end and register a moderate CAGR of 4.7%. The report estimates that lack of resources for collection of samples, questionable potency of vaccines, and absence of harmonised vaccination procedures are limiting the supply and production of veterinary vaccines in the MEA region. Furthermore, ineffectiveness of veterinary vaccines in curing virulent animal diseases indicates shortcomings on epidemiological knowledge faced by MEA’s virology research institutes. Request Report Sample@ www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-ma-3086 Highest Veterinary Vaccine Sales recorded in Jordan A regional analysis of the veterinary vaccines market in the Middle East identified Jordan as the most lucrative country for sales of veterinary serums. By the end of 2026, Jordan’s veterinary vaccine market is expected to dominate the MEA region by reaching value of US$ 88 million. The demand for veterinary vaccines will be equally higher in Turkey, while Sudan will witness moderate growth in terms of revenues. Meanwhile, countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Egypt will witness revenue growth at more than 4% CAGR throughout the forecast period. Based in Jordan, JOVAC is being recognised as one of the leading manufacturers of veterinary vaccines in the Middle East. The veterinary vaccines market in MEA region is also witnessing fervent involvement of European companies such as Bioveta, Inc., Merial, Bayer Healthcare AG, and Ceva. Other key players in the MEA veterinary vaccines market include, Intervac Pvt. Ltd., Zoetis, Elanco, and Merck & Co, Inc. Surging Demand for Food & Mouth Disease Vaccination Prevalence of oral and digestion-related disorders among animals is shaping up the growth in demand for veterinary vaccines across the Middle East. More than 25% of veterinary vaccines revenues amassed from the MEA region during the projection period will be accounted by food and mouth diseases. New Castle disease has also been observed as prominent indicator for administering veterinary vaccines in this region. Moreover, outbreak of Avian influenza in the MEA region is anticipated to attribute more than US$ 80 million revenues by 2026-end. Send An Enquiry@ www.futuremarketinsights.com/askus/rep-ma-3086 In the report, titled “Veterinary Vaccines Market: Middle East Industry Analysis and Opportunity Assessment, 2016-2026,” the demand for attenuated live vaccines is predicted to remain high throughout the forecast period. Inactivated vaccines will also gain traction, while revenues garnered from sales of recombinant vaccines, DNA vaccines and toxoid vaccines will grow at a sluggish CAGR. Almost three-fourth of gross revenues amassed from sales of veterinary vaccines in the Middle East will continue to be used for treatment of livestock animals. And, these vaccines are likely to enter the market through veterinary clinics and private veterinary pharmacies. Distribution of veterinary vaccines in the Middle East will also be carried out by hospitals, revenues from which are estimated to surpass US$ 100 million by the end of 2026.

pre-clinical studies News provided by Stainwei 03 May, 2017, 06:00 ET Share this article SUZHOU, China, May 3, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Stainwei Biotech, Inc. (Stainwei), a Chinese biotech company located in Biobay industrial park in Suzhou, China, announced today that it has received a patent certificate (Patent No. US9,580,498) issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for its novel humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody (mAb code name: hPV19). This patent was issued through a pathway of PCT application (PCT/CN2013/086542) filed by Stainwei in 2013. Prior to receiving the US patent, Stainwei has already received two patent certificates for this antibody from China Intellectual Property Office in 2015 and 2016. Stainwei is dedicated to innovation and development of novel therapeutic antibody drugs targeting cancers, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and immune-related diseases. A phase I clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of hPV19 in cancer patients is ongoing in China. According to the data released by the company, hPV19 has a unique antigen recognition site (epitope), composed of amino acid sequences different from other commercially available antibodies targeting the same antigen. In both in-vitro and in-vivo experiments, hPV19 showed a 6-8 times higher biological activity than Avastin (generic name: bevacizumab, Roche/Genentech's anti-VEGF mAb, the world's first and so far still the only FDA-approved anti-VEGF mAb drug on the market). "In pre-clinical animal studies and early stage clinical trials in cancer patients, hPV19 has also demonstrated an excellent safety and tolerance profile," said Dr. Qunmin Zhou, the company's co-founder. "We are excited to test its efficacy in the ongoing clinical trials. We are also excited to hopefully bring to the market a unique, non-biosimilar, and stronger therapeutic agent that can benefit our patients." mAb hAb21 eradicates established tumors in human PD-1 knock-in mice Human PD-1 gene knock-in mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 1 x106 MC38 tumor cells. When tumors reached about 50 mm3 (day 6 after inoculation), mice were randomized into three groups and were administered either pembrolizumab (10 mg/kg, n=6), hAb21 (10 mg/kg, n=6) or saline (NS-control, n=6 ) on days 6, 10, 13, and 17 after tumor inoculation. Data are mean +SD for 5-6 mice in each group. A: Tumor growth in early stage;... Meanwhile, Stainwei has filed a PCT patent application for a new formulation of hPV19 mAb intended for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic macular edema (DME) and other eye-disorders associated with VEGF-mediated vascular over-growth. Stainwei has completed preclinical experiments and an application for Investigational New Drug (IND) in AMD and DME will be submitted to China-FDA soon.  The company's another promising product is a novel anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody named hAb21 (humanized IgG4-kappa version). hAb21 binds to human PD-1 antigen at a unique site (epitope), which is different from that of Keytruda (Merck) and Opdivo (Bristol-Myers Squibb). hAb21 has shown a remarkable anti-tumor activity in human PD-1 gene knock-in mouse models.  As illustrated in the above figure, syngenic MC38 tumors implanted in the PD-1 gene knock-in mice were completely rejected within 7-10 days without re-growth thereafter in all 6 mice in the group treated with hAb21. Furthermore, repeated MC38 tumor inoculation was performed to those mice on day 30, and tumors were again completely rejected within 10-14 days without further hAb21 treatment. All 6 mice survived to day 60 and received MC38 inoculation for the third time (experiment on-going). In the same knock-in mice treated with Keytruda (pembrolizumab), complete tumor rejection was observed in only 1 out of 6 mice, while initial tumor regression followed by re-growth after the completion of Keytruda treatment were found in the other 5 mice, which all died of tumor progression. Based on these encouraging results, Stainwei has filed a patent application for hAb21, and is currently carrying out IND-enabling studies. An IND indication for advanced solid tumors is expected to be submitted to China-FDA and US-FDA in the second-half of 2017. About Stainwei Biotech, Inc. Stainwei (www.stainwei.cn) was founded in May 2007 at Suzhou-Biobay, China. It currently has more than 10 monoclonal antibodies in the pipeline, targeting either well-known antigens such as VEGF, PD-1/PD-L1, PD-1H (VISTA), CTLA-4, SOST or other potential targets not to be disclosed at this time. Since its inception, Stainwei has received VC-funding of more than 100 million RMB from a number of institutions, which include Cowin Venture (Suzhou), Xiangtang Venture (Suzhou), Fortune-link (Shanghai) and Comway Capital (An-hui). Its therapeutic antibody program has also been supported by research grants from the Chinese government, Jiangsu province, Suzhou municipal city and Singapore-China Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP-Suzhou).  Contact: BD@stainwei.cn or zhoujim@stainwei.cn To view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/stainwei-granted-us-patent-for-anti-vegf-monoclonal-antibody-and-its-anti-pd-1-mab-demonstrating-prolonged-anti-tumor-activity-in-pre-clinical-studies-300450403.html SOURCE Stainwei Related Links http://www.stainwei.cn My News Release contains wide tables.

(Stainwei), a Chinese biotech company located in Biobay industrial park in Suzhou, China, announced today that it has received a patent certificate (Patent No. US9,580,498) issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for its novel humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody (mAb code name: hPV19). This patent was issued through a pathway of PCT application (PCT/CN2013/086542) filed by Stainwei in 2013. Prior to receiving the US patent, Stainwei has already received two patent certificates for this antibody from China Intellectual Property Office in 2015 and 2016. Stainwei is dedicated to innovation and development of novel therapeutic antibody drugs targeting cancers, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and immune-related diseases. A phase I clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of hPV19 in cancer patients is ongoing in China. According to the data released by the company, hPV19 has a unique antigen recognition site (epitope), composed of amino acid sequences different from other commercially available antibodies targeting the same antigen. In both in-vitro and in-vivo experiments, hPV19 showed a 6-8 times higher biological activity than Avastin (generic name: bevacizumab, Roche/Genentech's anti-VEGF mAb, the world's first and so far still the only FDA-approved anti-VEGF mAb drug on the market). "In pre-clinical animal studies and early stage clinical trials in cancer patients, hPV19 has also demonstrated an excellent safety and tolerance profile," said Dr. Qunmin Zhou, the company's co-founder. "We are excited to test its efficacy in the ongoing clinical trials. We are also excited to hopefully bring to the market a unique, non-biosimilar, and stronger therapeutic agent that can benefit our patients." Meanwhile, Stainwei has filed a PCT patent application for a new formulation of hPV19 mAb intended for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic macular edema (DME) and other eye-disorders associated with VEGF-mediated vascular over-growth. Stainwei has completed preclinical experiments and an application for Investigational New Drug (IND) in AMD and DME will be submitted to China-FDA soon. The company's another promising product is a novel anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody named hAb21 (humanized IgG4-kappa version). hAb21 binds to human PD-1 antigen at a unique site (epitope), which is different from that of Keytruda (Merck) and Opdivo (Bristol-Myers Squibb). hAb21 has shown a remarkable anti-tumor activity in human PD-1 gene knock-in mouse models. http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/506687/Stainwei.jpg [http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/506687/Stainwei.jpg] As illustrated in the above figure, syngenic MC38 tumors implanted in the PD-1 gene knock-in mice were completely rejected within 7-10 days without re-growth thereafter in all 6 mice in the group treated with hAb21. Furthermore, repeated MC38 tumor inoculation was performed to those mice on day 30, and tumors were again completely rejected within 10-14 days without further hAb21 treatment. All 6 mice survived to day 60 and received MC38 inoculation for the third time (experiment on-going). In the same knock-in mice treated with Keytruda (pembrolizumab), complete tumor rejection was observed in only 1 out of 6 mice, while initial tumor regression followed by re-growth after the completion of Keytruda treatment were found in the other 5 mice, which all died of tumor progression. Based on these encouraging results, Stainwei has filed a patent application for hAb21, and is currently carrying out IND-enabling studies. An IND indication for advanced solid tumors is expected to be submitted to China-FDA and US-FDA in the second-half of 2017. About Stainwei Biotech, Inc.

The shipment will be the first potentially preventative medicine to reach one of the hardest hit countries. But experts say that, with Ebola cases falling, it may be difficult to establish whether the jab offers any protection against the virus. It has been produced by British company GlaxoSmithKline and the US National Institutes of Health. Meaningful protection GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) said a plane carrying some 300 initial doses of the vaccine was expected to arrive in Monrovia on Friday. The company hopes the first volunteer will be immunised in the next few weeks. Scientists aim to involve 30,000 volunteers in the trial in total, including frontline health workers. If all regulations are met, 10,000 volunteers will be given the GSK vaccine. A matching number will get a placebo, dummy vaccine. And there are plans for a further 10,000 people to get a separate experimental jab. The results will be compared to see if either vaccine offers any meaningful protection against the virus. A version of the vaccine has already been tested on 200 healthy volunteers across the UK, US, Switzerland and Mali. GSK says it has been found to have an acceptable safety profile so far. But it is only in affected countries that experts can determine whether it provides adequate protection against the virus. Dr Moncef Slaoui, of GlaxoSmithKline said: "Shipping the vaccine today is a major achievement and shows that we remain on track with the accelerated development of our candidate Ebola vaccine. "The initial phase one data we have seen are encouraging and give us confidence to progress to the next phases of clinical testing." The company stresses the vaccine is still in development and the World Health Organization, and other regulators, would have to be satisfied the vaccine is both safe and effective before any mass immunisation campaigns could be considered. Field trials of other promising vaccines - for example one involving the company Merck - are planned in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in the months to come. And there are reports that a trial of an experimental drug called Zmapp might start in the next few weeks. Falling opportunities However, experts say with the number of Ebola cases falling opportunities to test vaccines and drugs could be limited. Prof Jonathan Ball, a virus expert based at Nottingham University, told the BBC: "Because case numbers are starting to come down it will become harder and harder to show if the vaccine is having any impact. "Ultimately we may be in position in a few months time where we don't know whether this vaccine is effective in humans. "But it is important to get answers if we can - if not for this outbreak, for future outbreaks. We need to be prepared."

(AP Photo/Mel Evans, File) ... more Photo: Mel Evans Car sales keep stocks in neutral 1 / 1 Back to Gallery New York Despite strong results from industrial companies, U.S. stocks couldn't get any momentum going Tuesday after carmakers said their sales are shrinking. Engine maker Cummins sent manufacturers and other industrial companies higher after reporting solid first-quarter earnings. A late slump took the price of oil to its lowest price in almost six months. Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler all fell after they said sales declined in April. Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Cornerstone Financial Partners, said auto sales have weakened because lenders are growing a bit hesitant to make loans to help people buy cars. "It's more a story specific to the auto sector as opposed to a slowdown in consumer spending," he said. Thanks to an upturn in the last few minutes of trading, the Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 2.84 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,391.17. The Dow Jones industrial average added 36.43 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,949.89. The Nasdaq composite set another record as it picked up 3.76 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,095.37. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks sank 8 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,399.36. The six largest automakers in the U.S. all said their sales fell in April. Vehicle sales have set records the last few years and analysts are worried the streak is ending and car companies are relying too much on discounts and incentives to keep their sales numbers high. Ford lost 50 cents, or 4.4 percent, to $10.92 and GM gave up $1, or 2.9 percent, to $33.20 while Fiat Chrysler skidded 49 cents, or 4.3 percent, to $10.92. Car retailers, rental companies and parts suppliers slipped as well. Industrial companies made some of the biggest gains. Cummins reported a far bigger profit and better sales than analysts expected, and its stock climbed $9.23, or 6.1 percent, to $160.56. The company said demand from construction and mining sales grew compared with the same period a year ago, but truck production in North America fell. Benchmark U.S. crude lost $1.18, or 2.4 percent, to $47.66 a barrel in New York. That's its lowest price since mid-November. Brent crude, used to price international oils, shed $1.06, or 2.1 percent, to $50.46 a barrel in London. Health care stocks shook off an early loss. Merck climbed after it reported strong sales of newer medications including its cancer drug Keytruda and hepatitis C drug Zepatier, and its stock gained 32 cents to $62.70. Hospital chain Tenet Healthcare jumped $3.31, or 21.6 percent, to $18.66 after it agreed to sell three hospitals to HCA Holdings for $725 million and said it will rejoin insurer Humana's network. Technology stocks rose further. The S&P 500's technology index, which includes 69 major companies, is at its highest levels since March 2000, the peak of the dot-com boom.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 3 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman BioLineRx to Initiate Phase 3 Study with BL-8040 as Novel Stem Cell Mobilization Treatment Following Successful Meeting with FDA TEL AVIV, Israel, May 3, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — – Initiation of Phase 3 registrational study expected in second half of this year  – Study to focus on stem cell mobilization for autologous transplantation in multiple myeloma patients BioLineRx Ltd. (NASDAQ/TASE: BLRX, BLRX.TA), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on oncology and immunology, today announced that it has met with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and has gained clarity on the development program and the design of a Phase 3 pivotal study for BL-8040, its robust platform for multiple oncology indications, as a novel stem cell mobilization treatment for autologous bone-marrow transplantation. Following its successful meeting with the FDA, the Company anticipates the initiation of a registrational Phase 3 trial during the second half of 2017. The study will investigate BL-8040 in combination with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) for mobilization of stem cells from the bone marrow to the peripheral blood, followed by collection and subsequent autologous transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma. „BL-8040 given as a single injection in a Phase 1/2 study in multiple myeloma patients was previously shown to be highly effective in mobilizing stem cells in combination with G-CSF,” said Philip Serlin, Chief Executive Officer of BioLineRx. „Following our recent successful meeting with the FDA, we believe we have a clear development path forward towards registration of BL-8040 as a novel stem cell mobilization treatment for autologous transplantation. We look forward to the initiation of the Phase 3 pivotal study later this year, which, if successful, could pave the way for future commercialization of BL-8040.” „We see clear potential for BL-8040 to benefit multiple myeloma patients undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation. In parallel, we are continuing to expand the potential of our unique BL-8040 oncology platform, with multiple clinical studies for additional indications that are up and running or expected to commence during 2017. These include several combination studies with immune checkpoint inhibitors, a Phase 2b study in consolidation AML and a Phase 2 study in allogeneic stem-cell mobilization as a monotherapy with topline results expected by the end of 2017,” added Mr. Serlin. About BL-8040  BL-8040 is a short peptide for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia, solid tumors, and stem cell mobilization. It functions as a high-affinity antagonist for CXCR4, a chemokine receptor that is directly involved in tumor progression, angiogenesis, metastasis and cell survival. CXCR4 is over-expressed in more than 70% of human cancers and its expression often correlates with disease severity. In a number of clinical and pre-clinical studies, BL-8040 has shown robust mobilization of cancer cells from the bone marrow, thereby sensitizing these cells to chemo- and bio-based anti-cancer therapy, as well as a direct anti-cancer effect by inducing apoptosis. In addition, BL-8040 has also demonstrated robust stem-cell mobilization, including the mobilization of colony-forming cells, and T, B and NK cells. BL-8040 was licensed by BioLineRx from Biokine Therapeutics and was previously developed under the name BKT-140. About Stem Cell Mobilization  High-dose chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplantation has become an established treatment modality for a variety of hematologic malignancies, including multiple myeloma, as well as various forms of lymphoma and leukemia. Stem cells are mobilized from the bone marrow using granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), harvested from the peripheral blood by apheresis, and infused to the patient after chemotherapy. This type of treatment often replaces the use of traditional bone marrow transplantation, because the stem cells are easier to collect and the treatment allows for a quicker recovery time and fewer complications. About BioLineRx   BioLineRx is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on oncology and immunology. The Company in-licenses novel compounds, develops them through pre-clinical and/or clinical stages, and then partners with pharmaceutical companies for advanced clinical development and/or commercialization. BioLineRx’s leading therapeutic candidates are: BL-8040, a cancer therapy platform, which has successfully completed a Phase 2a study for relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is in the midst of a Phase 2b study as an AML consolidation treatment and a Phase 2 study in stem cell mobilization for allogeneic transplantation; and AGI-134, an immunotherapy treatment in development for multiple solid tumors, which is expected to initiate a first-in-man study in the first half of 2018. In addition, BioLineRx has a strategic collaboration with Novartis Pharma AG for the co-development of selected Israeli-sourced novel drug candidates; a collaboration agreement with MSD (known as Merck in the US and Canada), on the basis of which the Company has initiated a Phase 2a study in pancreatic cancer using the combination of BL-8040 and Merck’s KEYTRUDA®; and a collaboration agreement with Genentech Inc., a member of the Roche Group, to investigate the combination of BL-8040 and Genentech’s Atezolizumab in several Phase 1b studies for multiple solid tumor indications and AML.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 3 May 2017 by Persistence Market Research Global Cancer Vaccines Market Estimated to Flourish by 2021 – Persistence Market Research Cancer (also called as malignant tumor or neoplasms) refers to the disease condition in which abnormal cells grow and invade in uncontrolled way to other tissues. This may lead to an uncontrolled spread of cancer tumors in the body. These cancer tumors are benign or malignant type. Benign tumors are non-cancerous and do not spread to other parts of the body. Malignant tumors spread throughout the body through lymph and blood. There are more than 100 types of cancers and most of them are named based on the organ or types of the cell where they occur. For example, thyroid cancer refers to the cancer of thyroid gland, pancreatic cancer is the cancer in the tissue of pancreas and lung cancer refers to the cancer in the tissue of lungs. Cancer vaccines enables to prevent the growth of cancer or reduce the risk of an individual. A sample of this report is available upon request @ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/5405 According to World Health Organization, approximately 8.2 million deaths are reported in the year of 2012 due to cancer. Also, it is predicted that annual cancer cases will rise to 14 million to 22 million in next two decades. In addition, it is stated by National Cancer Institute that there are approximately 1,660,290 cases reported in the United States in year 2013. These increasing incidences of cancer cases drives the market of cancer vaccines during the forecast period. The major driving factor of cancer vaccines is that these are low cost treatment as compared to the high cost cancer therapies which are commercially available. Moreover, increasing use of tobacco, alcohol and unhealthy dietary habits are leading risk factors for increasing number of cancer cases that will further propel the growth of cancer vaccines market. However, less number of commercially available vaccines for the treatment of cancer might restrain the market growth. Geographically, North America and Europe dominates the global cancer vaccines market due to large patient base and rise in treatment seeking population in these regions. Also, with the rise in geriatric population the number of people diagnosed with cancer also increases that ultimately impacts the growth of cancer vaccines in these markets. The market of cancer vaccines in Asia-Pacific holds a strong growth as there is a rise in total number of newly diagnosed patient population in this region. According to World Health Organization, 60% of the world’s annual cases occur in Africa, Asia and South America.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 3 May 2017 by Persistence Market Research Stroke Diagnostics and Therapeutics Market to Undertake Strapping Growth During 2016 to 2022 Stroke refers to the brain attack. Stroke occurs when the supply of blood to the brain is either interrupted or reduced. In this condition, the brain does not get enough oxygen or nutrients which cause the brain cells to die. Increasing number of patients at risk of developing stroke is one of the major factors driving growth of the stroke diagnostics and therapeutics market. According to the National Stroke Association, stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in America and a leading cause of adult disability. Stroke can happen to anyone anytime. The types of stroke include ischemic, hemorrhagic, and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). Ischemic strokes are caused due to blocked or narrowed arteries that connect to the brain, which results in reduced blood flow in these arteries. Hemorrhagic stroke is caused on account of the arteries in the brain either leaking blood or bursting open. In the TIAs, the flow of blood to the brain is only disrupted temporarily for a short period of time. A sample of this report is available upon request @ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/4789 The global stroke diagnostics and therapeutics market is categorized based on type and application. Based on type, the report covers diagnostics and therapeutics. The diagnostics segment is further segmented into: computed tomography scan (CT scan), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), carotid ultrasound, cerebral angiography, electrocardiography, echocardiography, and others. The therapeutics segment is further divided into: tissue plasminogen activator, antihypertensive, antiplatelet, and anticoagulant. Based on application, the market is segmented into ischemic stroke and haemorrhagic stroke. North America has the largest market for stroke diagnostics and therapeutics followed by Europe. This is due to the increasing number of patients at the risk of developing stroke, technologically advanced equipment for the diagnosis and treatment of stroke, rise in research and development activities, increasing awareness among people about the causes of stroke, and improved healthcare infrastructure in the region. The stroke diagnostics and therapeutics market in Asia is expected to experience high growth rate in the next few years. This is due to growing aging population, evolving R&D activities for drug discovery and development, increasing government support in the form of funding, growing awareness about stroke and its causes, and developing healthcare infrastructure in the region. In addition, growing demographics and economies in the developing countries such as India, China, and Japan are expected to lead growth in the stroke diagnostics and therapeutics market in Asia. Technological advancement in diagnosis and surgical equipment, increasing number of patients with stroke, growing aging population, rise in healthcare expenditure, growing diabetic population, increasing number of patients with hypertension and coronary heart diseases, rise in awareness about the stroke and its available treatment options in the market, rise in R&D activities in drug discovery and development are the key drivers for the global stroke diagnostics and therapeutics market. However, high cost of treatment and unfavorable reimbursement scenario are some factors restraining the growth of the global stroke diagnostics and therapeutics market. Increasing number of mergers and acquisitions, rapid product launches, and rise in number of collaborations and partnerships are some of the latest trends that have been observed in the global stroke diagnostics and therapeutics market.
