To view the Multimedia News Release, please click: https://www.multivu.com/players/uk/8107251-merck-iaco-sclerosis-care-giver-survey/ The survey is being launched in response to preliminary findings from research commissioned by Merck which indicate that while 18-34 year-olds make up the largest group of MS care partners, the impact of caregiving during the prime of their lives and the challenges faced by this group are poorly understood. The global survey aims to provide a deep understanding of these unmet needs as a first step towards developing better resources and solutions for MS care partners in the future. "We know that for many, providing care and support for someone with MS can be an overwhelming prospect - and this is particularly true for young people in the prime of their lives, building careers or families for example," said Rick Greene, Executive Advisor, International Alliance of Carer Organizations (IACO). "The findings from the Merck data highlight the stark reality that faces many care partners in MS - anxiety, depression and pain being just a few. Therefore, in collaboration with Merck, we are announcing a large-scale survey that will help us to build a comprehensive picture of the problems facing MS care partners and, importantly, look to develop solutions to address these needs." Preliminary findings from Merck-commissioned research showed the following: "There are more than 2.3 million people with multiple sclerosis (MS) worldwide. MS affects their quality of life and that of carers, family and friends" said Peer Baneke, CEO of the MS International Federation. "This year's World MS Day campaign encourages anyone affected by MS to share their tips for managing the challenges of #LifeWithMS." The global care partner survey, which is being launched on World MS Day and will be fielded in the following months, will uncover insights from care partners from Europe, the US and Canada. Results from the survey will be announced in the next 12 months along with recommendations on how support can be shaped to address the needs of MS care partners, including younger care partners. "Merck is committed to improving understanding of the needs of MS patients and care partners to help inform our programs and initiatives," said Ali-Frédéric Ben-Amor, Vice President Global Medical Affairs, in the Neurology & Immunology business of Merck.

About Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune, chronic and inflammatory condition that affects the central nervous system (CNS) and is the most common, non-traumatic, disabling neurological disease in young adults. Relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) is the most common form of MS, and around 85% of people with MS are diagnosed with this type.[i] The exact cause of MS is unknown but it is thought that the body's immune system attacks myelin, disrupting the information flow along the nerves. There is currently no cure for MS, but treatments are available to help slow the course of the disease. About World MS Day 2017 World MS Day is officially marked on the last Wednesday of May. Events and campaigns take place throughout the month of May.

Through a multi-year collaboration on a shared “Learning Laboratory,” the companies will explore value-based and pay-for-performance models, known as Outcomes-Based Risk Sharing Agreements (OBRSAs), and their potential for broad adoption among health insurance companies, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), and pharmaceutical companies. The initiative will involve the use of real world data to co-develop and test advanced predictive models and co-design OBRSAs to reduce clinical and financial uncertainty with respect to payment for prescription drugs. Under OBRSAs, health plans and other payers reimburse drug manufacturers on the basis of clinical outcomes achieved. Prices can fall or rise if the results succeed or fail to meet expectations outlined in the agreement. Increasingly, OBRSAs have become part of the conversation across the health care system due to the desire by health plans, care providers, PBMs, and pharmaceutical companies to base reimbursements on evidence-based outcomes. Because the measuring and monitoring of clinical outcomes is crucial to the viability and applicability of these models, Optum’s integrated claims and clinical records will be used to provide data reflective of real world patient care and outcomes in the United States. These data assets will enable the companies to assess OBRSA models across different patient populations, clinical settings, and therapeutic areas aligned with Merck’s product portfolio. “Ensuring that health care dollars are spent on interventions that improve patient care and health outcomes is a shared goal for all stakeholders,” said Curt Medeiros, president of Optum Life Sciences. “This collaboration offers an opportunity to leverage our collective strengths to increase knowledge about the design and implementation of outcomes-based contracts in the U.S. health system.” Optum and Merck plan to publicly share analytic insights, findings and recommendations to help inform and facilitate the understanding and use of pragmatic approaches to OBRSAs in the health care system. “Our collaboration will create a unique data-driven platform to enable modeling and analysis of innovative contracts that are needed to move to a value-based health care model,” said Susan Shiff, senior vice president, Center for Observational and Real-world Evidence, Merck. “The collaboration between Merck and Optum will help advance both organizations’ common goals of improving patient health outcomes, expanding access to innovative therapies, and ensuring the best use of health care spending.” Optum provides expertise in pharmaceutical contracting, health economic and outcomes research, actuarial analytics, and health policy and regulation, as well as access to data required for exploration of these new models. Merck provides data science and outcomes research expertise, a deep understanding of the pharmaceuticals marketplace, and years of experience working with large private and public customers to create flexible pricing models across multiple therapy areas.

To view the Multimedia News Release, please click: https://www.multivu.com/players/uk/8107251-merck-iaco-sclerosis-care-giver-survey/ The survey is being launched in response to preliminary findings from research commissioned by Merck which indicate that while 18-34 year-olds make up the largest group of MS care partners, the impact of caregiving during the prime of their lives and the challenges faced by this group are poorly understood. The global survey aims to provide a deep understanding of these unmet needs as a first step towards developing better resources and solutions for MS care partners in the future. "We know that for many, providing care and support for someone with MS can be an overwhelming prospect - and this is particularly true for young people in the prime of their lives, building careers or families for example," said Rick Greene, Executive Advisor, International Alliance of Carer Organizations (IACO). "The findings from the Merck data highlight the stark reality that faces many care partners in MS - anxiety, depression and pain being just a few. Therefore, in collaboration with Merck, we are announcing a large-scale survey that will help us to build a comprehensive picture of the problems facing MS care partners and, importantly, look to develop solutions to address these needs." Preliminary findings from Merck-commissioned research showed the following: Highest number of care partners were aged 18-34 (41% of males and 39% of females in this group) - The US had a higher percentage of care partners aged 18-34 (46% for male and 45% for female care partners vs. 35% male and 33% female care-partners within Europe) Family members caring for a mother with MS generated the majority of social media conversations related to MS caregiving, reflecting the prevalence of younger care partners in MS Problems identified among care partners included anxiety, depression, insomnia and pain, along with concerns about the financial impact of MS for families. "There are more than 2.3 million people with multiple sclerosis (MS) worldwide. MS affects their quality of life and that of carers, family and friends" said Peer Baneke, CEO of the MS International Federation. "This year's World MS Day campaign encourages anyone affected by MS to share their tips for managing the challenges of #LifeWithMS." The global care partner survey, which is being launched on World MS Day and will be fielded in the following months, will uncover insights from care partners from Europe, the US and Canada. Results from the survey will be announced in the next 12 months along with recommendations on how support can be shaped to address the needs of MS care partners, including younger care partners. "Merck is committed to improving understanding of the needs of MS patients and care partners to help inform our programs and initiatives," said Ali-Frédéric Ben-Amor, Vice President Global Medical Affairs, in the Neurology & Immunology business of Merck. "The global survey will help us identify new ways to support those affected by MS, including the families and friends of those with this overwhelming condition."

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 31 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Inthera Bioscience Raises CHF 10.5 Million in Series A Financing Round Zurich, Switzerland, May 31, 2017 / B3C newswire / — Inthera Bioscience, a Swiss biopharmaceutical company developing first-in-class targeted small molecule therapies for solid tumors, today announced the closing of a Series A financing of CHF 10.5 million (EUR 9.6 million). The financing round was led by Merck Ventures, with equal contribution from Aglaia BioMedical Ventures and Novo Seeds and the participation of a private investor. In conjunction with the financing round, Emmanuelle Coutanceau of Novo Seeds and Keno Gutierrez of Merck Ventures have joined the company’s Board of Directors. Earlier this year, the Board of Directors had already been strengthened with two experienced biotech executives, Klaus Schollmeier, who has assumed the Chairman role, and Anker Lundemose, joining as independent member. Inthera Bioscience employs a proprietary technology platform to rationally design small molecule inhibitors of intracellular protein-protein interactions (PPIs). The company’s drug discovery programs are focused on the development of novel first-in-class oral agents blocking aberrant cell signaling in solid tumors, which are currently in pre-clinical development. Since its incorporation in 2013, Inthera’s drug discovery projects have made rapid progress under the leadership of the founders Ulrich Kessler and Paramjit Arora.      Jasper Bos, Vice President at Merck Ventures and former Chairman of Inthera’s Board of Directors, commented: “Having been able to play an active role in this venture and to support the translation of outstanding science into highly innovative therapeutics, has been deeply satisfying. Inthera’s technology has the potential to radically change our perspective on the druggability of intracellular PPIs.” “I first met Ulrich in 2015 and have been following Inthera ever since”, said Klaus Schollmeier, Chairman of the Board of Directors. “It is fascinating to watch his entrepreneurial spirit driving everyone involved. The continuous progress in Inthera’s lead program is very impressive and a reward for the hard effort and dedication of the whole team. It is a great pleasure to join this exciting endeavor and work with such a strong investor syndicate.” “We are now in a position to complete the pre-clinical development of our lead program against HPV-associated cancers and expand our operations and pipeline”, said Ulrich Kessler, Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of Inthera. “I am very glad about the strong commitment from our investors and look forward to unfolding Inthera’s innovative potential in oncology supported by our experienced new board members.”    About Inthera Bioscience AG Inthera Bioscience is a private biopharmaceutical company focused on developing inhibitors of intracellular protein-protein interactions employing a proprietary technology platform. Rationally designed, these orally bioavailable molecules display hot spot residues on a non-peptidic backbone merging the versatility of small molecules with the specificity of biologics. The broad applicability of the approach has been illustrated against several targets in oncology. Inthera’s lead programs focus on HPV-associated cancers and hypoxia-inducible signaling.

The ASCO meeting, which starts Friday in Chicago, draws tens of thousands of specialists from around the world. This year it will feature more than 250 presentations involving immune-system-boosting drugs known as checkpoint inhibitors, with the lion’s share of research focused on drugs that target a protein called PD-1, including Merck & Co Inc's Keytruda, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's Opdivo and Roche Holding AG's Tecentriq. The drugs work by releasing molecular brakes, or checkpoints, that tumors use to avoid the body’s immune system. That allows the immune cells to recognize and attack cancer cells the same way they fight infections caused by bacteria or viruses. For certain cancers, like melanoma, the treatments can mean long-term survival for around 20 percent of patients. Researchers and drugmakers are now focused on testing whether these new drugs can become more powerful, and treat more people, in combination. "We need to probably add to those regimens to have the best chance of eradicating all of the clones that lead to (drug) resistance," said Craig Tendler, head of late development and global medical affairs at Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen division. "To get from 20-25 percent of patients up to 50 percent and beyond is going to require other approaches." In some cases, researchers are combining different types of checkpoint inhibitors. They are also testing the new treatments with older drugs like chemotherapy. "There are hundreds and hundreds of combination trials," said Brad Loncar, manager of the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF. "We are still waiting for a winner to emerge." The global market for cancer immunotherapies alone is expected to grow more than fourfold to $75.8 billion by 2022, according to research firm GlobalData. Other checkpoint inhibitor drugs that will be in focus at ASCO include those that target the CTLA4 protein, such as Bristol's Yervoy, and those that target IDO1. A small study released earlier this month showed that combining Merck's Keytruda with an experimental IDO1 drug from Incyte Corp led to a high rate of durable responses in patients with advanced lung cancer. Separately, U.S. regulators approved a combination of Keytruda and chemotherapy for previously untreated advanced lung cancer. "As far as which combinations we think will look better ... it is a little early," said Dr. Bruce Johnson, chief clinical research officer at Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and ASCO's incoming president. New data is also expected on a different class of experimental drugs that recruit immune system cells, known as CAR-T therapies, from companies including Kite Pharma Inc, Juno Therapeutics Inc and Novartis AG. The ASCO meeting will feature key trial results on the best use of J&J's Zytiga for men newly diagnosed with high-risk, metastatic prostate cancer and of AstraZeneca Plc's ovarian cancer drug Lynparza in breast cancer. New data on treating genetically-defined cancers will be presented from a wide range of companies including Loxo Oncology Inc and Roche, which aims to insure use of its newer targeted breast cancer drug Perjeta before its older, multibillion-dollar drug, Herceptin, loses patent protection.

Wilson Sonsini tops Life Sciences Law Firm Index for 2nd straight year Biotech, Pharma In landmark move, FDA approves cancer drug for a biomarker not a tissue By Juliet Preston 1 Comment / May 23, 2017 at 8:39 PM Shares1.1k Colon, pancreatic, stomach, or ovarian cancer; it increasingly shouldn’t matter. In an era of precision medicine, the treatment approach should reflect the genetic makeup of the person’s tumor and the presence or absence of key biomarkers. That ethos was set in stone on Tuesday, with the landmark FDA approval of Merck’s checkpoint inhibitor, Keytruda (pembrolizumab), for patients with solid tumors that express so-called mismatched repair genes. In a statement, FDA noted the historic nature of its decision. “This is the first time the agency has approved a cancer treatment based on a common biomarker rather than the location in the body where the tumor originated.” It has been a long time in the making. Scientists’ understanding of cancer has shifted dramatically in the 21st Century, helped along by initiatives such as the human genome project and the advent of next-generation sequencing. One of the biggest revelations has been the degree of heterogeneity between cancers that arise from a single tissue: A breast cancer might be more akin to a melanoma than another breast cancer. As a result, it often makes sense to classify cancers based on their genetics, not their origin, when selecting oncology treatments. Following today’s approval, one the defining features of certain solid tumors will be whether they are microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). Both are abnormalities that affect the proper repair of DNA inside the cell (aka mismatch repair genes). According to FDA, colorectal, endometrial and gastrointestinal cancers have the highest rates of these mutations. MSI-H and dMMR also appear, albeit less commonly, in cancers arising in the breast, prostate, bladder, thyroid gland and other places. Approximately 5 percent of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer have MSI-H or dMMR tumors. Scientists at the Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy at Johns Hopkins Medicine were the first to hypothesize that tumors with these mismatch repair genes would be particularly susceptible to immunotherapies, such as Keytruda. The idea was advanced into clinical trials and ultimately given the green light via FDA’s accelerated approval route. “I think that this is a really positive development for a couple of reasons,” said Joydeep Goswami, president, clinical NGS and oncology at Thermo Fisher Scientific, in online correspondence. “First, it reinforces the idea of cancer treatment being stratified by the molecular signature of the tumor. Second, it clarifies that the molecular signature of a tumor is more significant than the organ of origin. Both these emphasize the molecular nature of cancer and confirm the need to tie therapy selection to the precise molecular signature in order to ensure the best patient outcomes.” Keytruda is already approved for the treatment of certain patients with metastatic melanoma, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer, refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and urothelial carcinoma. Other checkpoint inhibitors, such as Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo, are hot on Merck’s heels chasing market share. Is medicine ready? It’s one thing to get an FDA approval, it’s another to implement this form of medicine nationwide. As many observers noted on Twitter, oncologists often specialize based on the tissue of origin. They’re colon cancer or breast cancer experts. Perhaps more importantly, the bulk of cancer patients in the U.S. still aren’t having their tumors sequenced. The next-generation sequencing diagnostics can cost thousands of dollars and insurers have argued that the clinical utility isn’t there. Medicare and Medicaid have taken the same stance. Today’s approval could help the industry move forward. Indeed, it has been noted that the lack of routine sequencing holds back recruitment for clinical trials, which in turn limits the approval of drugs that would validate the sequencing. Scott Tomlins, co-founder and laboratory director of Strata Oncology, stressed via email that there is much more work to be done to break this treatment stalemate. Strata deals with it firsthand through its work matching eligible patients with precision medicine trials. “Results like this confirm that we should be assessing the critical and targetable molecular alterations driving every individual’s cancer,” Tomlins said. “However, it is critical to recognize that with presently available drugs, only a small subset of patients with cancer are likely to benefit from this or most other targeted therapies. Thus, finding patients whose tumors have highly targetable alterations, and enrolling them onto the most appropriate clinical trials remain the critical barriers to accelerating approval of promising therapies and gaining widespread reimbursement for molecular profiling.” There’s also value in ruling out patients that are unlikely to respond to personalized therapies. Keytruda launched in the U.S. with a list price of $12,500 per patient per month, or $150,000 per year. Many trials are underway studying checkpoint inhibitors as part of combination therapies, which would see the cost climb further. The case is definitely building for genetic testing, as means to finding the right individuals and saving the expense and struggle of treating those who are unlikely to benefit.

If I had been asked how far back that went, after some thought, I would have suggested sometime in the mid- to late-70s after Michael Killeen took over as chief executive of the IDA. There have been many announcements in the last few weeks involving pharmaceutical companies investing in new jobs here, including Merck’s MSD in Cork and Carlow. I was pleasantly surprised the other day to discover that Abbott Laboratories has been in Ireland since 1946. It now has six manufacturing sites in Ireland and four other offices located in various parts of Ireland. It is one of the largest healthcare companies in the world. It has been a major success story. So much for those folk who ridiculed Ireland’s efforts at attracting foreign direct investment by suggesting they came only for 10 years until as the critics would insist “they used up the grants and then vanished”. Abbott is not the only company which has been in Ireland contributing to the economy for decades rather than just years. Abbott was back in the news again the other day with the announcement that Abbott intends to invest around €10m in its Irish nutritional devices business in Sligo. All of this is good news for the economy, for its employees and, of course, for those companies which supply goods and services to the company. However, it’s not just the investment of cash that is important, although that always helps. It’s another vote of confidence in an Ireland outside of Dublin. As the IDA said: “Multinational companies contribute significantly to Ireland in terms of direct employment, capital spend, and developing Ireland’s skill base.” Of course, they also pay taxes. The strength of the contribution of these multinational companies was a key factor in our ability to withstand the worst effects of the recent recession when much of the Irish domestic economy was seriously hammered. Indeed, we should not underestimate that contribution of the multinationals, even if at times little incidentals like Apple’s €13bn in back-taxes EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has ruled it pay back to the Irish Government leads to serious debate. Multinational companies accounted for about the vast bulk of all corporation taxes collected by the Government. Economist John FitzGerald estimates the multinationals accounted for 16% of total employment over the years 2012 to 2015. While the tax take from such companies, particularly coupled with the tax take from its employees, makes for a considerable part of the cash that we require to fund the day to day running of the economy, its importance to the economy has in fact lessened. That is to be welcomed as ultimately we must be able to support ourselves. Yet, foreign direct investment is still mobile investment. Its objective is to find a location where it can consistently make money. It will not establish an operation in any country without considerable thought. Likewise, it will not leave a location on a whim, nor will it do it lightly. But it will pull out its investment if makes sense for it to do so. Abbott has been in Ireland for over 70 years and has expanded its operations. This proves that such companies can and will become part of the local economy and remain so for a very long time. However, it makes it even more important we establish our own sustainable industrial base in what is an ever and rapidly changing global economy. Ultimately, we should not be totally dependent on decision makers who have no vested interest in the sustainable success of the Irish economy.

In more than an hour and a half of video, Tiger is seen swaying, rolling his eyes and falling asleep as police administer field sobriety tests before he was arrested for DUI and taken into police custody. Slurring his words as he tried to answer questions from police, T iger could barely stand up and kept weaving and bobbing, failing to walk a straight line barefoot after removing his sneakers. Police have also released photos of Woods' bashed up $220,000. Mercedes Benz. The 41-year-old golfer had to be woken up by an officer and stated that he did not know where he was after first claiming he had driven from California. His speech was 'extremely slow and slurred' and he failed four field sobriety tests, although he  blew .000 into a breathalyzer, suggesting he hadn't been drinking alcohol. Jupiter police took off Tiger's baseball cap as they administered field sobriety tests At one point Tiger took off his sneakers and placed them under the police car and he was barefoot when trying to walk a straight line Woods was arrested for DUI after failing four sobriety tests. He admitted he had taken prescription drugs Woods was handcuffed and taken away in the back of police car Woods' Mercedes had two flat tires and 'fresh damage' on the driver's side when cops found him asleep behind the wheel.  Both tire rims on the driver's side of the Mercedes had some small but visible damage, while the front and rear tires on that side were flat. There was also some minor damage to the bumper on the driver's side, and scuffs and scratches on the rear bumper. The passenger side rear taillight was also not working, according to the documents.  Woods failed four field sobriety tests according to the Probable Cause Affidavit, which was obtained by DailyMail.com - which also revealed Woods was on four prescription drugs - although he tested negative for alcohol.

Woods was approached by a member of the Jupiter Police Department, who found him wearing his seat belt while sound asleep at the wheel of his $222,000 Mercedes. The star's car was idling in the middle of Military Trail about one mile from police headquarters, a deserted stretch of road at night but an extremely busy traffic artery during the day. Both his brake lights and flashers were on. After he was woken by cops, Woods - who was alone in the car - told them he had no idea where he was, according to the paperwork. 'I asked Woods where he was going to which he stated he did not know, he just likes to drive,' the arresting officer's affidavit states. Wearing athletic shorts and a t-shirt, Woods was actually driving south, away from his home on Jupiter Island, according to police, who were not aware of what happened to the tires Woods was described as cooperative and confused at first in the reports, which goes on to reveal that he agreed to a breathalyzer and blew .000 One officer said that Woods was falling asleep even after police had come to investigate his car Eldrick T. Woods was approached by a member of the Jupiter Police Department, who found him wearing his seat belt while sound asleep at the wheel of his pricey Mercedes seadan seen in better days Scene: The 41-year-old golfer had to be woken up by an officer and stated that he did not know where he was after first claiming he had driven from California (site of Woods' DUI arrest above) Another officer said that Woods was falling asleep even after police had come to investigate his car.  The golfer later stated 'he was coming from LA California from golfing,' reads the report. 'Woods stated that he did not know where he was. Woods had changed the story of where he was was going and where he was coming from.' He then asked 'how far from his house he was,' according to the affidavit. When asked again where he was coming from and heading to, he told police he was leaving LA and 'that he was on his way down to Orange County.'  Wearing athletic shorts and a t-shirt, Woods was actually driving south, away from his home on Jupiter Island, the report notes. After a fellow cop, who was interviewing the suspect returned to his car, he observed 'the driver fell asleep with his eyes closed and his head up against the headrest.'  Woods was described as cooperative and confused at first in the reports, which goes on to reveal that he agreed to a breathalyzer despite earlier reports. Bad news: The Probable Cause Affidavit from Tiger Woods' DUI arrest reveals that the golfer was asleep at the wheel when he was approached early Monday (Woods above in March) The affidavit also states that there were no odors coming from Woods or the car, this also despite earlier reports claiming that Woods' breath smelled like liquor according to one officer on the scene. Police say that when he exited his car, he was struggling to keep upright and was 'swaying and nearly lost his balance.' He leaned down to tie his shoes, resting his foot on the police patrol car, and 'nearly lost his balance.' 'I asked Woods if he wished to takeoff his shoes. Woods removed his shoes and left them under the front end of my patrol vehicle,' the officer said in the report. Woods appeared confused and seemed to struggle during the sobriety tests. At one point, when Woods was asked to say recite the alphabet backwards to check if he might be under the influence of drugs or alcohol, he instead offered to 'recite the entire national anthem backwards.'  'When asked if he understood the directions he stated, 'yes, recite the entire national anthem backwards.'  Only after the instructions were repeated did he eventually get it right.  'After several times of explaining the instructions he competed the task correctly,' the officer said in the report. Performing under pressure: After failing four field sobriety tests, Woods did manage to successfully recite the national anthem backwards (report above) Family: Wodds and ex-wife Elin Nordegren share custody of their daughter Sam, 9, and son Charlie, 7 (Woods and Nordegren with Sam in 2009 above) Woods was also asked to perform a Walk & Turn first according to the affidavit, but 'could not maintain starting position,' 'missed heel to toe each time,''stepped off line several times' and 'used arms for balance.' Woods also 'stopped walking to steady self' at one point notes the report. He next was asked to perform a One Leg Stand, and was unable to raise his leg off the ground six inches, placing his foot down 'several times' while he tried to complete the test. The Finger To Nose seemed to confuse Woods, who despite having the instructions explained to him multiple times and claiming he understood what was being asked of him failed to complete the task as ordered according to the report. Woods also did not complete the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus as he 'did not follow the stimulus.' In total, six members of law enforcement were involved in the arrest, five of whom were on the scene of the incident at some point on Monday.  'Based on all my observations, Woods SFSTs, and statements made by Woods, I believed I had probably cause to arrest and charge Woods with DUI.' The golf pro was placed in handcuffs, placed under arrest and transported to the station where at 4am, a little less than two hours after the arrest, Woods was observed by one of the officers on the scene for 20 minutes prior to submitting to a breathalyzer. The affidavit notes that Woods' speech was 'slow, sluggish, very slurred' and his attitude was described as 'sluggish, sleepy, unable to walk alone.' Woods was 'cooperative as much as possible' but 'very droopy, extremely sleepy' and had trouble keeping his eyes open.  The breathalyzer was agreed to the report notes, and the results were explained to Woods after he blew a .000 twice in the span of three minutes. He then agreed to the urine test, which was drawn at 4:40 am according to the report, and was read his rights. The results of which have not been released at the time. VICODIN Vicodin is a powerful painkiller prescribed for moderate to severe pain. It contains a mix of hydrocodone (an opioid) and acetaminophen (a less potent painkiller, like Tylenol, that accentuates the effects of hydrocodone). Hydrocodone can slow or stop breathing. Too much acetaminophen can damage the liver. The FDA warning for Vicodin says it 'may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery; patients should be cautioned accordingly.' Users are warned not to take Vicodin if: - they have taken a MAO inhibitor in the last 14 days - they have recently taken a sedative - they have a history of alcohol problems  The affidavit, which also reveals that Woods was on four prescription drugs - Soloxex [sic], Vicodin, Torix and Vioxx. The affidavit notes that Woods has not taken Vioxx this year.    Woods refused however to complete the question and answer section of the form, which involves a mix of general questions about the current date and time along with personal questions about physical aliments or any prescription drugs an individual is taking at the time.  In the Notice to Appear, Officers state that there was no indication of alcohol influence during Woods' arrest, but under drug influence marked 'unknown.' Woods, who occupation is listed as 'athlete,' is facing a traffic misdemeanor for his driving under the influence arrest and will make his first appearance in court later this summer. That appearance is a mandatory one for Woods, who must be in attendance on that date according to the notice he received on Monday. He could be facing up to six months in prison if convicted on the charge, and be ordered to pay $1,000 in fines while performing up to 50 hours of community service. Woods could also walk free if test show he took no more than the recommended dosage of his medication, which was prescribed by a medical professional. It was hard for the golfer to walk according to the report, which notes that he has undergone four left knee surgeries and four Achilles operations. Woods' first knee surgery occurred back in 1994 while he was still in college, with the teenager having a benign tumor removed from his knee. His Achilles injuries meanwhile all came around the same time his career began to spiral back in 2008, with the four operations he underwent occurring between then and 2012.  Not noted on the report is the fact that Woods has also had four procedures done on his back as well, the most recent being the fusion procedure he underwent in April.  'The surgery went well, and I'm optimistic this will relieve my back spasms and pain,' Woods said shortly after the operation.  'When healed, I look forward to getting back to a normal life, playing with my kids, competing in professional golf and living without the pain I have been battling so long.' Work in progress: It was also hard for the golfer to walk according to the report, which notes that he has undergone four left knee surgeries and four Achilles operations (surgeries above) Rough time: Woods had difficulty signing his name (top left) and then writing in print (bottom right) on his Notice to Appear at 7:30am on Monday morning  His most recent blog post was just six day ago, and the typically laconic Woods wrote in depth about how happy he was with his surgery and his excitement about a possible return to golf. 'It has been just over a month since I underwent fusion surgery on my back, and it is hard to express how much better I feel. It was instant nerve relief. I haven't felt this good in years,' wrote Woods.  He went on to say that while it was a difficult decision to make, he ultimately agreed to the surgery so he could 'have a life with his kids.' VIOXX Woods said he has not taken this in the past year. Vioxx was withdrawn from the US market in 2004 over safety concerns that it increases risk of heart attack and stroke. A major report published by the journal Lancet found that 88,000 Americans had heart attacks from taking Vioxx, and 38,000 of them died. It is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (known medically as rofecoxib) that was once prescribed to treat osteoarthritis, acute pain conditions and period pains. Last year, manufacturer Merck & Co had to pay $830 million to resolve a class action suit with shareholders. The company has reserved $4.85 billion to settle legal claims with patients. Here is a brief timeline: - May 1999: First approved by the FDA in 1999, Vioxx was sold by Merck & Co. - December 1999: within months, a safety panel found that scores of patients had suffered serious heart problems or died - double the rate of those on a similar drug with different properties. - In the ensuing years, numerous studies found similar issues - but in that time, 20 million Americans took the drug - September 2004: Merck withdraws the drug after a large study found the clearest evidence that Vioxx increases the risk of heart attacks Woods then wrote about his career moving forward, stating: 'As for returning to competitive golf, the long-term prognosis is positive. My surgeon and physiotherapist say the operation was successful. It's just a matter of not screwing up and letting it fuse. I'm walking and doing my exercises, and taking my kids to and from school. All I can do is take it day by day. There's no hurry.' He added: 'But, I want to say unequivocally, I want to play professional golf again.' The golfer closed out the post as if it would be his last for some time, writing: 'That's about it for now. Have a great summer.'  Should he return, Woods would still be in striking distance of the two biggest PGA records, with his 79 wins just three shy of Sam Snead's record 82 and his 14 Majors four shy of record-holder Jack Nicklaus. Not one to weigh in on the personal matters of his fellow athletes, Nicklaus was forced to speak about Woods' situation due to the fact that he had a previously scheduled press conference on Tuesday afternoon ahead of the  Memorial Tournament, which he founded over four decades ago. When asked if he wanted to comment, Nicklaus responded: 'Not really.' He then added however: 'I feel bad for Tiger. Tiger's a friend. He needs all our help.'  Woods also owns a restaurant near his home in Jupiter, The Woods. The establishment offers classic American fare and drinks along with a lengthy list of bourbons, ryes, cognacs and cigars.    He released a book this past March as well,   Forbes estimated Woods' net worth to be $740million in 2016, with the golfer making $45.5million just that year in endorsements despite his lackluster play on the links.  Time will now tell if any of those big name sponsors, including Nike and Rolex, opt out of their relationship with the golfer.  Woods resigned with Nike back in 2013, but the company stopped making golf equipment last year, meaning that the athlete is being paid to wear their clothing. And that is something he will not be doing for some time after his surgery.  Secret garden: Woods lives in a $54million mansion in Hobe Sound that is well guarded and secluded (entrance above) In The Woods: The golfer also owns a restaurant near his home in Jupiter, The Woods (above), which offers classic American fare That personal fortune meanwhile comes after Woods handed over $750million to first wife Elin Nordegren in their 2010 divorce. The couple share custody of their daughter Sam, 9, and son Charlie, 7, with the exact details of their arrangement unknown due to a seal on the court documents, It is unclear if this arrest might impact the agreement between Woods and his ex-wife. Woods apologized for his actions in a statement late Monday, while claiming that he had not been drinking prior to his arrest and believed that he had suffered a reaction to a prescription medication.

I expect more from myself, too. I will do everything in my power to ensure this never happens again.' Woods then closed out by expressing his gratitude for the local authorities, saying: 'I fully cooperated with law enforcement, and I would like to personally thank the representatives of the Jupiter Police Dept. and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office for their professionalism.'  Share or comment on this article e-mail 1.2k shares Most watched News videos Tiger Woods tries to follow officers light during sobriety test Hilarious moment a farting goat scares a child Brazen thieves rob a California Apple store in broad daylight Jeremy Joseph Christian makes first public court appearance John legend's heartfelt message to Olivia Campbell's parents Hikers film friend's last moments before being swept away Hilarious moment tiny puppy pushes its friend down flight of stairs Un-bear-ably cute!

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Top Dividend Stocks in Diabetes Treatment Looking for great dividend stocks of drugmakers with diabetes treatments? Check out AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Sanofi. Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) May 31, 2017 at 3:44PM More than 420 million people across the world have diabetes. At least 29 million of those individuals are Americans, including an estimated 8 million undiagnosed cases. And prevalence of diabetes is increasing. Because of the enormous market size, many pharmaceutical companies have developed treatments for the disease. Some of these drugmakers rank as some of the best dividend stocks on the market. AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN), Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), and Sanofi (NYSE:SNY) stand out as the top dividend stocks in diabetes treatment, but several others are strong contenders. Image source: Getty Images. AstraZeneca AstraZeneca markets several diabetes treatments, including Bydureon, Byetta, Farxiga, Kombiglyze, Onglyza, Symlin, and Xigduo. The company's diabetes franchise generated revenue of $2.4 billion last year. Farxiga is AstraZeneca's No. 1 diabetes medication. Sales for the drug totaled $835 million in 2016, up 70% compared to the prior year. This strong growth knocked Onglyza out of the top spot among the company's diabetes drugs. AstraZeneca claims an attractive dividend yield of 5.58%. Although the company currently is paying out more in dividends than it's making on the bottom line, the dividend should be relatively safe because AstraZeneca appears to have solid earnings growth prospects in the coming years. Pfizer Pfizer doesn't have as significant a presence in the diabetes market as AstraZeneca. The big drugmaker's lineup includes diabetes medications Glucotrol, Glyset, and Micronase. However, none of these drugs generated enough sales to even merit a reference in Pfizer's annual report for 2016. More revenue in the diabetes market could be in store for Pfizer, though. Pfizer and its development partner, Merck (NYSE:MRK), expect a decision by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for SGLT2 inhibitor ertugliflozin by December 2017. The type 2 diabetes drug is expected to reach peak sales topping $1 billion. Pfizer has long been a favorite among dividend investors. It should be still, with a solid yield of 3.98%. Like AstraZeneca, Pfizer has a dividend payout ratio of just over 100%. While that's not good, it probably will only be temporary. Pfizer should experience reasonable earnings growth in the near future, thanks in part to new products gained with several acquisitions made over the past few years. Sanofi Sanofi is a major player in the global diabetes market, with products such as Lantus, Amaryl, Apidra, Toujeo, Insuman, Lyxumia, and Soliqua. Lantus is Sanofi's top-selling product in its diabetes franchise and overall. It's also the No.1 insulin brand in the world. A major challenge for Sanofi is that sales of Lantus are slipping due to generic competition. Sales for Toujeo, however, are soaring and have largely offset the decline for Lantus. Soliqua should also help. The drug gained U.S. approval in late 2016 and is expected to generate peak annual sales of around $1.5 billion. In addition, Sanofi has a couple of promising late-stage diabetes candidates in its pipeline.  Sanofi's dividend currently yields 3.21%. Its payout ratio of 86% is relatively high, but the dividend doesn't appear to be in significant jeopardy right now. Other contenders There are other drugmakers in the diabetes market with dividend yields that aren't too far behind those of AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Sanofi. Merck, which markets Janumet and Januvia, claims a yield of 2.94%. Bristol-Myers Squibb, developer of diabetes drug Farxiga, sports a dividend yield of 2.9%. GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) also sells a diabetes drug, Tanzeum. The drugmaker's dividend yield of 4.55% would rank the stock second behind AstraZeneca. However, GlaxoSmithKline's payout ratio is a whopping 225%. There is significant reason to worry that Glaxo's dividend could be slashed in the future. Still, investors looking for great dividend stocks in the diabetes market have plenty of options from which to choose. AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Sanofi can deliver high yields and dividend checks that should keep on flowing well into the future. Keith Speights owns shares of Pfizer.

We like this definition. The reputation of the pharmaceutical industry is strong as the Pharma RepTrak® finds public perceptions are improving across 8 key markets BOSTON, USA (PRWEB) May 31, 2017 Reputation Institute named AbbVie the most reputable pharmaceutical company in today’s release of its annual Global Pharma RepTrak®. The study is based on over 16,500 reputation ratings collected during January and February 2017 among the general public in 8 key markets: Brazil, Canada, France, Italy, Germany, Spain, UK and US. The reputation of the pharmaceutical industry is improving and is now at a strong level with the general public. Overall, the industry earned a strong RepTrak® score of 71.8, up from 68.2 in 2016. 44% of respondents viewed the industry as having an excellent reputation with a 7% point increase compared to 2016, while 26% perceived it as weak or poor, down from 35% in 2016. “The strong reputation results come as a surprise to many, who expect the general public to be very negative towards the pharmaceutical companies. However, the reputation data tells a different story,” says Kasper Ulf Nielsen, Executive Partner of Reputation Institute. “We see that the general public actually has strong positive feelings about the individual pharmaceutical companies which they see as delivering on core expectations within products and services, innovation, and leadership. This does not match the media coverage, which is very negative, but serves as a good reminder that media coverage does not equal reputation. Reputation is the perception people have, and that is what is captured in the RepTrak® study.” The Pharma RepTrak® measures the perception of 17 pharmaceutical companies on overall reputation as well as the seven rational dimensions of reputation: products / services, innovation, workplace, governance, citizenship, leadership and performance. Each company is measured by the general public who are somewhat or very familiar with the company. The top 10 companies in the 2017 Global Pharma RepTrak® are: 1.    AbbVie 2.    Novo Nordisk 3.    Takeda 4.    Roche 5.    Janssen Pharmaceuticals 6.    Gilead Sciences 7.    Bayer 8.    MSD / Merck & Co 9.    Sanofi 10.    Eli Lilly AbbVie tops the reputation ranking and saw a strong improvement of 5.3 RepTrak® points since last year. “Since the company’s inception less than five years ago, we have worked to raise a better understanding of AbbVie among our key stakeholders,” said Laura Schumacher, Executive Vice President, External Affairs, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, AbbVie. “We are pleased that these efforts have resonated with our global audience and driven greater understanding of who we are and what we stand for as a company.” Investing in a strong reputation pays off. A 5-point increase in reputation results in a 9% increase in recommendation. The benefit of a strong reputation is seen for AbbVie, Novo Nordisk, and Takeda, where 54% of the general public would definitely recommend these companies, compared to only 44% who would do the same for Pfizer and GSK. “In a world where word of mouth is becoming more and more critical, reputation is proving to be a key driver of business success, and that’s why the leading companies are actively measuring and managing it,” says Kasper Ulf Nielsen, Executive Partner at Reputation Institute. Within the 7 dimensions of reputation AbbVie took the top spot within Workplace, Governance and Citizenship while Novo Nordisk won on the dimensions of Products / Services and Innovation. Bayer was rated as the best company within Financial Performance and Leadership. The perceptions of the pharmaceutical companies are improving across all seven dimensions of reputation placing 5 of the 7 dimensions in the strong tier. The strongest perception is for Financial Performance followed by Products / Services, Leadership, and Innovation. Governance and Citizenship are the only dimensions, which are still rated in the average tier with scores of 69.2 and 69.5, respectively. Only 1-4% of people hold negative views of the companies across the 7 dimensions, which explain the improvement in reputation overall. However, some individual companies are still struggling with weak perceptions in specific markets, and they are falling further behind as the rest of the industry is improving.

Saag, associate dean for global health, and director of the Center for AIDS Research at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine. “The addition of a convenient once-daily version with a comparable efficacy and safety profile at 48 weeks to the existing twice-daily version of ISENTRESS provides physicians with a new therapeutic option for some patients with HIV-1 infection.” ISENTRESS and ISENTRESS HD do not cure HIV-1 infection or AIDS. Severe, potentially life-threatening and fatal skin reactions have been reported. This includes cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hypersensitivity reaction, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Immediately discontinue treatment with ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD and other suspect agents if severe hypersensitivity, severe rash, or rash with systemic symptoms or liver aminotransferase elevations develop and monitor clinical status, including liver aminotransferases closely. For more information, see “Selected Safety Information” below. The FDA approval of once-daily ISENTRESS HD (raltegravir) is supported by data from the pivotal Phase 3 ONCEMRK trial. At Week 48, 89 percent (N=531) of treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected patients receiving ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 x 600 mg) once a day achieved viral suppression of HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL compared to 88 percent (N=266) of patients receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice a day, each in combination therapy with emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, with a treatment difference of 0.5 percent, and a 95 percent confidence interval of -4.2, 5.2. This was consistent across demographic groups at initiation of therapy and a variety of patient populations, including those with high viral load (HIV-1 RNA >100,000 copies/mL). “Because of improvements in the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapies and with appropriate access to care, HIV infection can now be managed as a chronic disease,” said Carl Schmid, deputy executive director of the AIDS Institute. “For people living with HIV, having a wide range of effective therapies is important because it provides options to fit patients’ individual needs and lifestyles.” In ONCEMRK, through 48 weeks, the rate of discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events was low (1 percent in patients receiving ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg once daily and 2 percent in patients receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily). There were no drug-related clinical adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity occurring in ≥2 percent of patients in either treatment group. Clinical adverse reactions of all intensities (mild, moderate, and severe) occurring in ≥2 percent of patients on ISENTRESS HD or ISENTRESS included abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and decreased appetite. Treatment-emergent viral mutations leading to any drug resistance were detected in less than 1 percent (4/531) of those treated with ISENTRESS HD once daily. ISENTRESS HD can be co-administered with a wide range of antiretroviral agents and non-antiretroviral agents. The potential for drug-drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. The co-administration of ISENTRESS HD with aluminum and/or magnesium-containing antacids, calcium carbonate antacids, rifampin, tipranavir/ritonavir, etravirine, and other strong inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin) is not recommended. “ISENTRESS HD exemplifies Merck’s unwavering commitment to innovation in HIV therapy, and we are pleased to be able to offer this option to a broad range of appropriate adult and pediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg who are living with HIV,” said Dr. Eliav Barr, senior vice president, global clinical development, infectious diseases and vaccines, Merck Research Laboratories. The price of ISENTRESS HD will be the same as ISENTRESS twice daily. Merck anticipates ISENTRESS HD to be available in pharmacies in approximately four weeks.

The public rebuke came as Donald Trump reportedly prepared to pull out of the Paris climate accord, the agreement forged by close to 200 countries to address climate change. Some 62% of shareholders voted for the resolution and against Exxon’s management at the company’s annual meeting in Dallas, Texas. The vote to more clearly report how climate change impacts Exxon’s business comes as investors are increasingly demanding companies disclose the likely impact of global warming and follows the passing of similar proposals at two smaller energy companies earlier this month. Edward Mason, head of responsible investment at Church Commissioners for England, which led the vote, said shareholders were showing how out of step the Trump administration had become on climate change. “Trump is acting contrary to Wall Street and the world’s largest investors,” he said. “Climate change is a material financial risk and shareholders want to know how companies will manage the change to a low carbon economy.” Exxon’s management sought to head off the proposal championed by the pension funds of the Church of England, New York and California and other large shareholders, which will force the company to conduct an annual “stress test” measuring how its oil assets will be affected by climate change regulation and new technology. Last year, the same proposal was backed by 38% of shareholders who voted. Addressing the meeting Mason said many of the company’s board members had made clear that “they recognised the significance of the agreed international goals on climate change” in their other roles. Board member Ursula Burns, former CEO of Xerox, signed the Obama administration’s climate pledge, and fellow board member Kenneth Frazier chairs Merck, a pharmaceutical company that supports “national and international action to address the challenges presented by climate change”, said Mason. He pointed out that another board member, Susan Avery, former president of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, had told the Financial Times: “Clearly climate science is telling us get off fossil fuels as much as possible.” “Members of the board, do you leave your understanding of climate change at the door when you attend the ExxonMobil board meeting?” Mason asked. Chief executive Darren Woods said: “We believe the risks of climate change are serious and warrant action, thoughtful action. As a company we are taking action in many ways.” But he said the company was doing enough to address the impact of climate change and regulation on its business and that the board was against the proposal. “The board believes the company has adequately assessed the future impact of policy developments,” he said. Earlier this month, shareholders overcame management opposition to similar proposals at Occidental Petroleum and PPL, a large utility holding company, and passed resolutions forcing the companies to more clearly explain how climate change could affect their businesses. BlackRock, Exxon’s largest shareholder, backed the resolution at Occidental’s shareholders’ meeting, the first time the investment group had voted against a company’s management over climate change. “When we do not see progress despite ongoing engagement, or companies are insufficiently responsive to our efforts to protect the long-term economic interests of our clients, we will not hesitate to exercise our right to vote,” BlackRock said a statement. Sue Reid, vice-president of climate and energy at sustainable investor network Ceres, called the vote “historic”. “This is a very strong message from investors that climate change matters and must be addressed. Now we need to see Exxon take action.” New York comptroller Thomas P DiNapoli said: “This is an unprecedented victory for investors in the fight to ensure a smooth transition to a low-carbon economy. Climate change is one of the greatest long-term risks we face in our portfolio and has direct impact on the core business of ExxonMobil. The burden is now on ExxonMobil to respond swiftly and demonstrate that it takes shareholder concerns about climate risk seriously.” The ExxonMobil resolution, introduced by the New York State Common Retirement Fund, says that the company “should analyze the impacts on ExxonMobil’s oil and gas reserves and resources under a scenario in which reduction in demand results from carbon restrictions and related rules or commitments adopted by governments consistent with the globally agreed upon 2 degree [Celsius] target”. The resolution adds: “This reporting should assess the resilience of the company’s full portfolio of reserves and resources through 2040 and beyond, and address the financial risks associated with such a scenario.” The meeting, the first since former CEO Rex Tillerson left to become secretary of state, was held at the IM Pei-designed Morton H Meyerson symphony center in downtown Dallas.

We have invested heavily to give our customers a tool that will help them to successfully move forward in digitization,” says founder and Co-CEO André Christ. “You can’t build your IT architecture today with yesterday’s tools and stay in business tomorrow,” is the motto at LeanIX. While numerous tools in the EAM market allow for a high degree of data model adaptation, this adaptability often compromises the usability and the integration potential. The new version 4.0 enables the complete customization of the data model and, at the same time, developers will find it easy to integrate into existing IT landscapes thanks to the strongly typed API. “With GraphQL, a technology developed by Facebook and now used by GitHub, among others, we have found the ideal technology to provide our customers with high-performance, graph-based access to their data,” says André Christ. LeanIX is also committed to continuity in all of their innovations: The familiar, modern LeanIX user interface is significantly faster in the new version, although its look and feel remains almost unchanged. This makes migration to the new version extremely quick and easy, and all existing customers will benefit from this free of charge over the coming months thanks to Software as a Service. With the new product features, LeanIX perfectly supports this year’s motto of the Gartner Summit: “Mastering Digital Business Platform Complexity”. LeanIX 4.0 “Pathfinder” makes it quick and easy to analyze greater amounts of information about your company’s IT architecture. This is particularly relevant to the management of microservice architectures. For many organizations, the move away from a monolithic to a microservice architecture promises significant improvements in the speed and agility of IT. While over 70% of the respondents to a LeanIX study[1] are planning this step in 2017, LeanIX has already completed this transformation with its own product, which makes the company an ideal sparring partner for customers on their way to a modern IT architecture. About LeanIX LeanIX helps companies become digital champions in their industry. With the SaaS-based information hub, companies make better and faster decisions on how to constantly reinvent their IT architecture. LeanIX establishes the 360-degree transparency needed to reduce IT complexity in the IT landscape, ensures compliance and enables growth through adopting state-of-the-art technology. At the core of the Enterprise Architecture Management solution is an intelligent IT inventory that makes up-to-date information of the IT landscape easily accessible for all relevant staff.

The ASCO meeting, which starts Friday in Chicago, draws tens of thousands of specialists from around the world. This year it will feature more than 250 presentations involving immune-system-boosting drugs known as checkpoint inhibitors, with the lion’s share of research focused on drugs that target a protein called PD-1, including Merck & Co Inc's Keytruda, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's Opdivo and Roche Holding AG's Tecentriq. The drugs work by releasing molecular brakes, or checkpoints, that tumors use to avoid the body’s immune system. That allows the immune cells to recognize and attack cancer cells the same way they fight infections caused by bacteria or viruses. For certain cancers, like melanoma, the treatments can mean long-term survival for around 20 percent of patients. Researchers and drugmakers are now focused on testing whether these new drugs can become more powerful, and treat more people, in combination. "We need to probably add to those regimens to have the best chance of eradicating all of the clones that lead to (drug) resistance," said Craig Tendler, head of late development and global medical affairs at Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen division. "To get from 20-25 percent of patients up to 50 percent and beyond is going to require other approaches." In some cases, researchers are combining different types of checkpoint inhibitors. They are also testing the new treatments with older drugs like chemotherapy. "There are hundreds and hundreds of combination trials," said Brad Loncar, manager of the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF. "We are still waiting for a winner to emerge." The global market for cancer immunotherapies alone is expected to grow more than fourfold to $75.8 billion by 2022, according to research firm GlobalData. Other checkpoint inhibitor drugs that will be in focus at ASCO include those that target the CTLA4 protein, such as Bristol's Yervoy, and those that target IDO1. A small study released earlier this month showed that combining Merck's Keytruda with an experimental IDO1 drug from Incyte Corp led to a high rate of durable responses in patients with advanced lung cancer. Separately, U.S. regulators approved a combination of Keytruda and chemotherapy for previously untreated advanced lung cancer. "As far as which combinations we think will look better ... it is a little early," said Dr. Bruce Johnson, chief clinical research officer at Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and ASCO's incoming president. New data is also expected on a different class of experimental drugs that recruit immune system cells, known as CAR-T therapies, from companies including Kite Pharma Inc, Juno Therapeutics Inc and Novartis AG. The ASCO meeting will feature key trial results on the best use of J&J's Zytiga for men newly diagnosed with high-risk, metastatic prostate cancer and of AstraZeneca Plc's ovarian cancer drug Lynparza in breast cancer. New data on treating genetically-defined cancers will be presented from a wide range of companies including Loxo Oncology Inc and Roche, which aims to insure use of its newer targeted breast cancer drug Perjeta before its older, multibillion-dollar drug, Herceptin, loses patent protection.

"As far as which combinations we think will look better ... it is a little early," said Dr. Bruce Johnson, chief clinical research officer at Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and ASCO's incoming president. New data is also expected on a different class of experimental drugs that recruit immune system cells, known as CAR-T therapies, from companies including Kite Pharma Inc, Juno Therapeutics Inc and Novartis AG. The ASCO meeting will feature key trial results on the best use of J&J's Zytiga for men newly diagnosed with high-risk, metastatic prostate cancer and of AstraZeneca Plc's ovarian cancer drug Lynparza in breast cancer. New data on treating genetically-defined cancers will be presented from a wide range of companies including Loxo Oncology Inc and Roche, which aims to insure use of its newer targeted breast cancer drug Perjeta before its older, multibillion-dollar drug, Herceptin, loses patent protection.

The ASCO meeting, which starts Friday in Chicago, draws tens of thousands of specialists from around the world. This year it will feature more than 250 presentations involving immune-system-boosting drugs known as checkpoint inhibitors, with the lion’s share of research focused on drugs that target a protein called PD-1, including Merck & Co Inc’s Keytruda, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s Opdivo and Roche Holding AG’s Tecentriq. The drugs work by releasing molecular brakes, or checkpoints, that tumors use to avoid the body’s immune system. That allows the immune cells to recognize and attack cancer cells the same way they fight infections caused by bacteria or viruses. For certain cancers, like melanoma, the treatments can mean long-term survival for around 20 percent of patients. Researchers and drugmakers are now focused on testing whether these new drugs can become more powerful, and treat more people, in combination. “We need to probably add to those regimens to have the best chance of eradicating all of the clones that lead to (drug) resistance,” said Craig Tendler, head of late development and global medical affairs at Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen division. “To get from 20-25 percent of patients up to 50 percent and beyond is going to require other approaches.” In some cases, researchers are combining different types of checkpoint inhibitors. They are also testing the new treatments with older drugs like chemotherapy. “There are hundreds and hundreds of combination trials,” said Brad Loncar, manager of the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF. “We are still waiting for a winner to emerge.” The global market for cancer immunotherapies alone is expected to grow more than fourfold to $75.8 billion by 2022, according to research firm GlobalData. Other checkpoint inhibitor drugs that will be in focus at ASCO include those that target the CTLA4 protein, such as Bristol’s Yervoy, and those that target IDO1. A small study released earlier this month showed that combining Merck’s Keytruda with an experimental IDO1 drug from Incyte Corp led to a high rate of durable responses in patients with advanced lung cancer.

Relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) is the most common form of MS, and around 85% of people with MS are diagnosed with this type.1 The exact cause of MS is unknown but it is thought that the body’s immune system attacks myelin, disrupting the information flow along the nerves. There is currently no cure for MS, but treatments are available to help slow the course of the disease. About World MS Day 2017 World MS Day is officially marked on the last Wednesday of May. Events and campaigns take place throughout the month of May. It brings the global MS community together to share stories, raise awareness and campaign with and for everyone affected by multiple sclerosis. In 2009, the MS International Federation (MSIF) MS International Federation (MSIF) and its members initiated the first World MS Day. Campaigns are rolled out globally which focus on a different theme each year. The theme for World MS Day 2017 is ‘Life with MS’. About the International Alliance of Carer Organizations (IACO) Incorporated in 2012, the International Alliance of Carer Organizations (IACO) serves as an umbrella organization that provides cohesive direction, facilitates information sharing, and actively advocates for carers at an international level.

Meet the Contributors → Woodcock: New Approvals Show FDA Is Adapting to Precision Medicine Frank Vinluan May 30th, 2017 @frankvinluan @xconomy Like Us Xconomy National —  The randomized controlled trial has long been held up as the gold standard for testing new drugs. But the nation’s top drug evaluator, Janet Woodcock, believes they aren’t necessary for all new experimental treatments. Randomized trials are long, expensive to run, and ultimately produce limited answers, she said at a medical conference last week. The ability to use genetic information to classify patients and match them to potential therapies opens up new possibilities for evaluating drugs. As these capabilities increase, Woodcock says, the FDA should adjust its approach to reviewing drugs. “People have been very happy with the use of the traditional standard randomized controlled trial,” Woodcock said last Thursday at the Precision Medicine World Conference at Duke University. “People know how to interpret that evidence. Yet that may not be appropriate for some of these diseases.” The FDA has shown such flexibility with two recent approvals based on better genetic insights. Last week, the FDA approved Merck’s (NYSE: MRK) cancer drug pembrolizumab (Keytruda) for all solid tumors with a specific genetic signature, regardless of where in the body the cancer started. That decision came days after the regulator expanded use of Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) cystic fibrosis drug, ivacaftor (Kalydeco), so more patients with a particular genetic mutations could get treatment. The additional approvals for both drugs did not require the companies to conduct more randomized controlled trials. Woodcock described the approvals as “landmarks for precision medicine.” Pembrolizumab was already approved to treat cancers of the skin, lung, and bladder, among others. The data supporting the latest approval for the Kenilworth, NJ-based company’s drug came from open-label “basket trials” that simultaneously tested pembrolizumab on a variety of tumors that all share a specific genetic alteration. Patients were selected for the studies based on genetic tests that identified that signature, a predictor of whether they would respond to the Merck therapy. The FDA’s ruling was an “accelerated approval,” meaning Merck must gather additional evidence to confirm the earlier studies. Woodcock said that this type of flexible approach is particularly important for diseases that have no treatment alternatives. Genetic information has also played a role in the development and approval of Vertex’s cystic fibrosis drug, ivacaftor. The drug was initially approved to treat patients who have specific mutations that indicate they would respond to the drug. On May 17, the FDA expanded the approval from 10 mutations to 33. Woodcock said the FDA based this decision on several factors, but the main evidence was a laboratory test that showed the drug could also help CF patients with more gene mutations. Woodcock said that this decision opens a pathway for drugs in cystic fibrosis and other diseases that have similar signs and symptoms. After a drug is first approved, a drugmaker could get additional approvals for additional patient subsets by using the lab test, rather than conducting a randomized clinical trial for each group. The FDA and drug companies have been talking about adding new approaches to clinical trials for years, and that effort is now getting a nudge forward under federal law. Among the provisions of the wide-ranging 21st Century Cures Act, signed into law last year, are requirements that the FDA hold public hearings and issue guidance to help drug companies use new clinical trial designs to test their drugs. The law also calls on the FDA to use real-world evidence to support applications for new uses of already approved drugs. (Regulatory Affairs has a good breakdown of what the new federal law means for the FDA.) Woodcock didn’t reference the Cures Act in her remarks. But she said that for some drugs, different trial designs are warranted. “Platform trials” might be useful to evaluate multiple drugs and drug combinations simultaneously, with the ability to adjust the studies on the fly by adding or dropping arms. This flexibility allows … Next Page » Single PageCurrently on Page: 1 2 Frank Vinluan is editor of Xconomy Raleigh-Durham, based in Research Triangle Park.

Vasculitis is a group of disorders that leads to swelling of blood vessels. In a clinical study of 251 patients with giant cell arteritis, the primary endpoint, defined as the proportion of patients achieving sustained remission from Weeks 12 to 52, was met. Sustained remission included absence of symptoms, normalization of inflammatory laboratory tests, and tapered use of prednisone. More patients receiving Actemra plus prednisone achieved sustained remission compared to patients receiving placebo plus prednisone. A First: FDA OK’s Keytruda For Any Solid Tumor Based on Biomarker For the first time in cancer treatment, a drug has been FDA-approved based on a tumor’s biomarker (specific genetic marker) without regard to the tumor’s original location, such as with breast cancer. Merck’s Keytruda (pembrolizumab) can now be used for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors that have been identified as having a biomarker referred to as microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). This use includes patients who have failed therapy with no alternatives and those with advanced colorectal cancer who failed certain chemotherapy drugs. In studies, a total of 15 cancer types were identified, most commonly colorectal, endometrial and other gastrointestinal cancers. IL-6 Antagonist Kevzara Cleared to Treat Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Kevzara (sarilumab), from Regeneron and Sanofi, is an interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) antagonist newly FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response or cannot tolerate one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Kevzara may be used alone or in combination with methotrexate (MTX) or other conventional DMARDs. In the MOBILITY study, treatment with Kevzara plus MTX improved physical function and demonstrated significantly less radiographic progression of structural damage compared to placebo plus MTX. In studies, common side effects included neutropenia, increased liver enzymes, and injection site redness, among others. FDA Approves Radicava to Treat Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis It's been over 2 decades since a new drug was approved for ALS. This month, the FDA approved Radicava (edaravone) for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly referred to as Lou Gehrig’s disease. ALS is a rare disease that kills the nerve cells that control voluntary muscles, and most people die from respiratory failure. Radicava is a free radical scavenger that relieves oxidative stress and may affect progression of ALS. In studies at week 24, individuals receiving Radicava declined less in assessment of daily functioning compared to placebo. Common side effects reported in clinical trials were bruising and gait disturbance. AstraZeneca’s Imfinzi Cleared for Advanced Bladder Cancer Imfinzi (durvalumab) has been FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma who have disease progression despite use of platinum-containing chemotherapy with or without surgery. Imfinzi is an anti-PD-L1 (programmed death ligand-1) human monoclonal antibody. In studies, Imfinzi had an objective response rate (ORR) of 17%, regardless of PD-L1 status, with an ORR of 26.3% in patients with PD-L1 high-expressing tumors. Among 31 patients who responded to treatment, 14 patients (45%) had ongoing responses of at least 6 months and 5 patients (16%) at least 12 months. Of all evaluable patients, 2.7% achieved a complete response.

He failed four field sobriety tests according to the Probable Cause Affidavit, which was obtained by DailyMail.com - which also revealed Woods was on four prescription drugs - although he tested negative for alcohol. New documents released on Tuesday reveal that both tire rims on the driver's side of the Mercedes had some small but visible damage, while the front and rear tires on that side were flat. There was also some minor damage to the bumper on the driver's side, and scuffs and scratches on the rear bumper. The passenger side rear taillight was also not working, according to the documents.   The affidavit states that at 2:03am, Eldrick T. Woods was approached by a member of the Jupiter Police Department, who found him wearing his seat belt while sound asleep at the wheel of his $222,000 Mercedes.

Share this article Share 150 shares The star's car was idling in the middle of Military Trail about one mile from police headquarters, a deserted stretch of road at night but an extremely busy traffic artery during the day. Both his brake lights and flashers were on. After he was woken by cops, Woods - who was alone in the car - told them he had no idea where he was, according to the paperwork. 'I asked Woods where he was going to which he stated he did not know, he just likes to drive,' the arresting officer's affidavit states. Up and at 'em: Eldrick T. Woods was approached by a member of the Jupiter Police Department, who found him wearing his seat belt while sound asleep at the wheel of his $222,000 Mercedes (above) Scene: The 41-year-old golfer had to be woken up by an officer and stated that he did not know where he was after first claiming he had driven from California (site of Woods' DUI arrest above) Another officer said that Woods was falling asleep even after police had come to investigate his car.  The golfer later stated 'he was coming from LA California from golfing,' reads the report. 'Woods stated that he did not know where he was. Woods had changed the story of where he was was going and where he was coming from.' He then asked 'how far from his house he was,' according to the affidavit. When asked again where he was coming from and heading to, he told police he was leaving LA and 'that he was on his way down to Orange County.'  Wearing athletic shorts and a t-shirt, Woods was actually driving south, away from his home on Jupiter Island, the report notes. After a fellow cop, who was interviewing the suspect returned to his car, he observed 'the driver fell asleep with his eyes closed and his head up against the headrest.'  Woods was described as cooperative and confused at first in the reports, which goes on to reveal that he agreed to a breathalyzer despite earlier reports. Bad news: The Probable Cause Affidavit from Tiger Woods' DUI arrest reveals that the golfer was asleep at the wheel when he was approached early Monday (Woods above in March) The affidavit also states that there were no odors coming from Woods or the car, this also despite earlier reports claiming that Woods' breath smelled like liquor according to one officer on the scene. Police say that when he exited his car, he was struggling to keep upright and was 'swaying and nearly lost his balance.' He leaned down to tie his shoes, resting his foot on the police patrol car, and 'nearly lost his balance.' 'I asked Woods if he wished to takeoff his shoes. Woods removed his shoes and left them under the front end of my patrol vehicle,' the officer said in the report. Woods appeared confused and seemed to struggle during the sobriety tests. At one point, when Woods was asked to say recite the alphabet backwards to check if he might be under the influence of drugs or alcohol, he instead offered to 'recite the entire national anthem backwards.'  'When asked if he understood the directions he stated, 'yes, recite the entire national anthem backwards.'  Only after the instructions were repeated did he eventually get it right.  'After several times of explaining the instructions he competed the task correctly,' the officer said in the report. Performing under pressure: After failing four field sobriety tests, Woods did manage to successfully recite the national anthem backwards (report above) Family: Wodds and ex-wife Elin Nordegren share custody of their daughter Sam, 9, and son Charlie, 7 (Woods and Nordegren with Sam in 2009 above) Woods was also asked to perform a Walk & Turn first according to the affidavit, but 'could not maintain starting position,' 'missed heel to toe each time,''stepped off line several times' and 'used arms for balance.' Woods also 'stopped walking to steady self' at one point notes the report. He next was asked to perform a One Leg Stand, and was unable to raise his leg off the ground six inches, placing his foot down 'several times' while he tried to complete the test. The Finger To Nose seemed to confuse Woods, who despite having the instructions explained to him multiple times and claiming he understood what was being asked of him failed to complete the task as ordered according to the report. Woods also did not complete the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus as he 'did not follow the stimulus.' In total, six members of law enforcement were involved in the arrest, five of whom were on the scene of the incident at some point on Monday.  'Based on all my observations, Woods SFSTs, and statements made by Woods, I believed I had probably cause to arrest and charge Woods with DUI.' The golf pro was placed in handcuffs, placed under arrest and transported to the station where at 4am, a little less than two hours after the arrest, Woods was observed by one of the officers on the scene for 20 minutes prior to submitting to a breathalyzer. The affidavit notes that Woods' speech was 'slow, sluggish, very slurred' and his attitude was described as 'sluggish, sleepy, unable to walk alone.' Woods was 'cooperative as much as possible' but 'very droopy, extremely sleepy' and had trouble keeping his eyes open.  The breathalyzer was agreed to the report notes, and the results were explained to Woods after he blew a .000 twice in the span of three minutes. He then agreed to the urine test, which was drawn at 4:40 am according to the report, and was read his rights. The results of which have not been released at the time. VICODIN Vicodin is a powerful painkiller prescribed for moderate to severe pain. It contains a mix of hydrocodone (an opioid) and acetaminophen (a less potent painkiller, like Tylenol, that accentuates the effects of hydrocodone). Hydrocodone can slow or stop breathing. Too much acetaminophen can damage the liver. The FDA warning for Vicodin says it 'may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery; patients should be cautioned accordingly.' Users are warned not to take Vicodin if: - they have taken a MAO inhibitor in the last 14 days - they have recently taken a sedative - they have a history of alcohol problems  The affidavit, which also reveals that Woods was on four prescription drugs - Soloxex [sic], Vicodin, Torix and Vioxx. The affidavit notes that Woods has not taken Vioxx this year.    Woods refused however to complete the question and answer section of the form, which involves a mix of general questions about the current date and time along with personal questions about physical aliments or any prescription drugs an individual is taking at the time.  In the Notice to Appear, Officers state that there was no indication of alcohol influence during Woods' arrest, but under drug influence marked 'unknown.' Woods, who occupation is listed as 'athlete,' is facing a traffic misdemeanor for his driving under the influence arrest and will make his first appearance in court later this summer. That appearance is a mandatory one for Woods, who must be in attendance on that date according to the notice he received on Monday. He could be facing up to six months in prison if convicted on the charge, and be ordered to pay $1,000 in fines while performing up to 50 hours of community service. Woods could also walk free if test show he took no more than the recommended dosage of his medication, which was prescribed by a medical professional. It was hard for the golfer to walk according to the report, which notes that he has undergone four left knee surgeries and four Achilles operations. Woods' first knee surgery occurred back in 1994 while he was still in college, with the teenager having a benign tumor removed from his knee. His Achilles injuries meanwhile all came around the same time his career began to spiral back in 2008, with the four operations he underwent occurring between then and 2012.  Not noted on the report is the fact that Woods has also had four procedures done on his back as well, the most recent being the fusion procedure he underwent in April.  'The surgery went well, and I'm optimistic this will relieve my back spasms and pain,' Woods said shortly after the operation.  'When healed, I look forward to getting back to a normal life, playing with my kids, competing in professional golf and living without the pain I have been battling so long.' Work in progress: It was also hard for the golfer to walk according to the report, which notes that he has undergone four left knee surgeries and four Achilles operations (surgeries above) Rough time: Woods had difficulty signing his name (top left) and then writing in print (bottom right) on his Notice to Appear at 7:30am on Monday morning  His most recent blog post was just six day ago, and the typically laconic Woods wrote in depth about how happy he was with his surgery and his excitement about a possible return to golf. 'It has been just over a month since I underwent fusion surgery on my back, and it is hard to express how much better I feel. It was instant nerve relief. I haven't felt this good in years,' wrote Woods.  He went on to say that while it was a difficult decision to make, he ultimately agreed to the surgery so he could 'have a life with his kids.' VIOXX Woods said he has not taken this in the past year. Vioxx was withdrawn from the US market in 2004 over safety concerns that it increases risk of heart attack and stroke. A major report published by the journal Lancet found that 88,000 Americans had heart attacks from taking Vioxx, and 38,000 of them died. It is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (known medically as rofecoxib) that was once prescribed to treat osteoarthritis, acute pain conditions and period pains. Last year, manufacturer Merck & Co had to pay $830 million to resolve a class action suit with shareholders. The company has reserved $4.85 billion to settle legal claims with patients. Here is a brief timeline: - May 1999: First approved by the FDA in 1999, Vioxx was sold by Merck & Co. - December 1999: within months, a safety panel found that scores of patients had suffered serious heart problems or died - double the rate of those on a similar drug with different properties. - In the ensuing years, numerous studies found similar issues - but in that time, 20 million Americans took the drug - September 2004: Merck withdraws the drug after a large study found the clearest evidence that Vioxx increases the risk of heart attacks Woods then wrote about his career moving forward, stating: 'As for returning to competitive golf, the long-term prognosis is positive. My surgeon and physiotherapist say the operation was successful. It's just a matter of not screwing up and letting it fuse. I'm walking and doing my exercises, and taking my kids to and from school. All I can do is take it day by day. There's no hurry.' He added: 'But, I want to say unequivocally, I want to play professional golf again.' The golfer closed out the post as if it would be his last for some time, writing: 'That's about it for now. Have a great summer.'  Should he return, Woods would still be in striking distance of the two biggest PGA records, with his 79 wins just three shy of Sam Snead's record 82 and his 14 Majors four shy of record-holder Jack Nicklaus. Not one to weigh in on the personal matters of his fellow athletes, Nicklaus was forced to speak about Woods' situation due to the fact that he had a previously scheduled press conference on Tuesday afternoon ahead of the  Memorial Tournament, which he founded over four decades ago. When asked if he wanted to comment, Nicklaus responded: 'Not really.' He then added however: 'I feel bad for Tiger. Tiger's a friend. He needs all our help.'  Woods also owns a restaurant near his home in Jupiter, The Woods. The establishment offers classic American fare and drinks along with a lengthy list of bourbons, ryes, cognacs and cigars.    He released a book this past March as well,   Forbes estimated Woods' net worth to be $740million in 2016, with the golfer making $45.5million just that year in endorsements despite his lackluster play on the links.  Time will now tell if any of those big name sponsors, including Nike and Rolex, opt out of their relationship with the golfer.  Woods resigned with Nike back in 2013, but the company stopped making golf equipment last year, meaning that the athlete is being paid to wear their clothing. And that is something he will not be doing for some time after his surgery.  Secret garden: Woods lives in a $54million mansion in Hobe Sound that is well guarded and secluded (entrance above) In The Woods: The golfer also owns a restaurant near his home in Jupiter, The Woods (above), which offers classic American fare That personal fortune meanwhile comes after Woods handed over $750million to first wife Elin Nordegren in their 2010 divorce. The couple share custody of their daughter Sam, 9, and son Charlie, 7, with the exact details of their arrangement unknown due to a seal on the court documents, It is unclear if this arrest might impact the agreement between Woods and his ex-wife. Woods apologized for his actions in a statement late Monday, while claiming that he had not been drinking prior to his arrest and believed that he had suffered a reaction to a prescription medication. The golfer underwent fusion surgery last month. 'I understand the severity of what I did and I take full responsibility for my actions. I want the public to know that alcohol was not involved,' said Woods. 'What happened was an unexpected reaction to prescribed medications. I didn't realize the mix of medications affected me so strongly.' He went on to state: 'I would like to apologize with all my heart to my family, friends, and the fans. I expect more from myself, too. I will do everything in my power to ensure this never happens again.' Woods then closed out by expressing his gratitude for the local authorities, saying: 'I fully cooperated with law enforcement, and I would like to personally thank the representatives of the Jupiter Police Dept. and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office for their professionalism.'  Share or comment on this article e-mail 150 shares Most watched News videos Brazen thieves rob a California Apple store in broad daylight Tiger Woods tries to follow officers light during sobriety test Hilarious moment a farting goat scares a child High school student goes on profanity-laced rant at a teacher Hilarious moment tiny puppy pushes its friend down flight of stairs Un-bear-ably cute!

Mr Murrin, who has been a leading voice in highlighting the measures the Irish Government needs to take to ensure agri jobs are protected post-Brexit, believes preserving the UK market is "deliverable". "I genuinely believe and want the UK to be as important to my company five and 10 years from now as it is today. I believe that is possible with very careful movements from the Government and all stakeholders. "I've no doubt some people will say I'm mad, but I think it is deliverable," he said. "We need to defend, protect and maintain the British market. We spent 50 years developing that market, moving it from the hacking and packing stage, and in the absence of positive policies coming forward that all stakeholders can engage in, protection and maintenance is really crucial and we also need to step up our diversification networks." Speaking at a major MSD Animal Health conference focused on Sustainable Irish Food production in 2025, Mr Murrin said he has explained to Government the actions, steps and policy variations required to achieve this goal. "The Government must take positive, industry-wide measures to make long-term, very low-cost and very appropriate condition finance available to the Irish food industry in all its guises so that we can scale up, invest in our own competitiveness and take whatever steps we need," he said. "It's not a pipe dream, it is deliverable, the money in sitting there." ‘The longer you keep it bottled up the worse it’s going to get’  Irish rugby star Jack McGrath said dealing with his brother’s suicide was incredibly tough. Sponsored by Mr Murrin also revealed that Dawn Farms, Europe's largest multi-species business-to-business cooked meat producer, cooked enough ham to cover the Aviva stadium 5,000 times last year. The company, with plants based in Naas, Co Kildare and Northampton, UK, also produced enough pepperoni and salami to "circle the world five times," Mr Murrin claimed. Meanwhile, at the same conference, MEP Mairead McGuinness said a recent dinner between British Prime Minister Theresa May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker intended to pave the way for formal Brexit talks went "worse than was reported". "I don't know what they had for dessert but I think there was salt on it," she said. "We're not really in a place where both sides are able to go into a room and come out with a deal. That's doesn't say we won't be there… but the politics are just not right at the moment I would have to say."

Everyone has trouble sleeping from time to time—stressful life events like having to take a test the next day, or dealing with worries about home or work can keep you from falling asleep or staying asleep. Sleeping problems that happen once or twice a month can be annoying, but usually will resolve on their own. Sleep aids can't replace healthy sleep habits; good sleep practices are the foundation of proper treatment for insomnia. Especially if your insomnia is long-standing, it's important to use non-medical approaches, such as proper sleep hygiene, and cognitive behavioural treatments for insomnia. For some, a combination of medical and behavioural treatments may be the best way to manage insomnia symptoms, and for others a sleep aid is used at the beginning of treatment and behavioural techniques take over as a long-term approach. Some sleep aids are available by prescription only. This is because it's important to work with a doctor to decide on the best type, dose, and plan for taking a sleep aid. Over-the-counter sleep aids work for some people, but it's not a good idea to use these regularly for a long period of time. The best practice is to use a sleep aid with the input of your doctor.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 31 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Ligand Announces Aziyo Biologics Acquires Commercial Products from Partner CorMatrix SAN DIEGO–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ: LGND) announces it will receive $10 million from a contractually specified royalty rate buy-down following the sale by CorMatrix Cardiovascular, Inc. of rights to its commercial pericardial repair and CanGaroo® Envelope extracellular matrix (ECM) products to Aziyo Biologics. In May 2016, Ligand acquired rights to royalties on these products and several pipeline ECM programs from CorMatrix for $17.5 million. Under the terms of the original transaction, Ligand was entitled to a $10 million payment if, upon acquisition, the new owner elected to buy-down the royalty rate. As a result of this transaction, Ligand will receive a 5% royalty on these commercial products from Aziyo, down from the original 20% royalty with CorMatrix. As part of the royalty rate reduction, Aziyo has agreed to pay Ligand up to $10 million of additional sales-based milestones tied to the commercial success of the currently-marketed products and to extend the term on these royalties by one year. Ligand’s rights to potential royalties from CorMatrix upon the successful development of its remaining pipeline ECM programs remain unchanged. “The royalty transaction entered into with CorMatrix last year has been successful in generating cash and has contributed quality shots on goal to our portfolio. CorMatrix made a strategic shift to focus on its pipeline assets, and we are encouraged by the experience and marketing strength of Aziyo’s management team,” said John Higgins, Chief Executive Officer. “This transaction repays the majority of the initial royalty purchase price, adds $10 million of new potential milestones and extends the term for royalties to be earned from the underlying ECM products. Ligand also retains rights to royalties on pipeline products being developed by CorMatrix. Overall, this transaction improves the value of the deal and near-term cash generation.” Financial Outlook As a result of this transaction, Ligand will book an estimated $2 million of additional revenue in 2017, net of offsetting non-cash accounting expenses. Previous net revenue guidance for 2017 was at least $130 million, and Ligand now expects 2017 net revenue to increase to at least $132 million. The additional revenue is expected to be classified as contract revenue and royalty revenue is expected to be slightly lower for the full year due to the lower royalty rate on CorMatrix products beginning with the second half of 2017. Additional upside in contract revenue guidance is reduced from $24 million to $14 million, reflecting the revenue from the royalty rate buy-down and associated amortization. This new revenue guidance implies a minimum adjusted diluted EPS for 2017 of $2.90, increased from original guidance of at least $2.70.

Actual events or results may differ from Ligand’s expectations. For example, Aziyo may not make the $10 million milestone payment as expected and may not be successful in commercializing the ECM products it has acquired from CorMatrix. Further, CorMatrix may not be successful in developing its ECM products and may abandon its development. With regards to Ligand’s proforma projections, Ligand may not receive expected revenue from material sales of Captisol, expected royalties on partnered products and research and development milestone payments.

Further, Ligand and its partners may experience delays in the commencement, enrollment, completion or analysis of clinical testing for its product candidates, or significant issues regarding the adequacy of its clinical trial designs or the execution of its clinical trials, which could result in increased costs and delays, or limit Ligand’s ability to obtain regulatory approval. Ligand may not be able to successfully implement its strategic growth plan and continue the development of its proprietary programs. The failure to meet expectations with respect to any of the foregoing matters may reduce Ligand’s stock price. Additional information concerning these and other risk factors affecting Ligand can be found in prior press releases available at www.ligand.com as well as in Ligand’s public periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission available at www.sec.gov.

HHS: Taxpayers May Have Overpaid $1.27 Billion For EpiPens Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share HHS: Taxpayers May Have Overpaid $1.27 Billion For EpiPens Image courtesy of Phillip Bradshaw May 31, 2017 4:56 pm EDT By Chris Morran@themorrancave that's a lot of epipens epipen medicaid drug prices generic drugs Even though drug company Mylan agreed to pay $465 million to quickly settle a Justice Department investigation into allegations that it deliberately overcharged Medicaid for its EpiPen emergency allergy injector, a new report from the Department of Health and Human Services indicating that taxpayers may have overpaid more than twice that amount over ten years. Earlier today, the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of the Inspector General sent Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley a letter [PDF], estimating that the actual additional cost for EpiPen from 2006 through 2017 could be as high as $1.27 billion. A quick lesson in how Medicaid pays for prescription medications: Drug companies whose products are purchased by Medicaid reimburse the program through mandatory rebates. The rate of those rebates is based on whether the drug is an “innovator” medication (often a newer, higher-cost drug with little or no competition) with a rebate rate of at least 23.1%, or a “non-innovator multiple source” (NIMS) drug (often an older drug with competition from generics), with a much lower rebate rate (currently 13%). Last fall, among rising concerns about Medicaid fraud, the Acting Administrator for the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), confirmed that Mylan had indeed mis-classified EpiPen as a NIMS drug and had been paying rebates that were at least ten percentage points smaller than what the company should have paid, since at least 2011. Mylan did not actually acquire EpiPen until 2007, when it purchased Merck’s generic drug business, so if the OIG’s estimate goes back to 2006, then Mylan may not be responsible for some of that potential $1.27 billion overcharge. Only two days after CMS confirmed the misclassification of EpiPen, and before it could determine the true amount and extent of Mylan’s overcharging, the drug company revealed the $465 million DOJ settlement in a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company also said the settlement allowed Mylan to avoid admitting any liability or wrongdoing. The settlement, which was never announced publicly by the DOJ and still has not been officially finalized, was heavily criticized on Capitol Hill, and Grassley’s Judiciary Committee asked Mylan to testify about the deal. However, the company declined to appear and explain itself to lawmakers. “The fact that the EpiPen overpayment is so much more than anyone discussed publicly should worry every taxpayer,” said Grassley in a statement, pointing out that CMS had previously advised Mylan about the improper classification of the drug but that the company did nothing to address this issue. “It looks like Mylan overcharged the taxpayers for years with the knowledge EpiPen was misclassified.” Grassley says Mylan has been unwilling to cooperate or to voluntarily provide documents requested by Judiciary. The Senator indicates in his statement that a subpoena may be “the only way to get to the bottom of this.” When reached for comment by Consumerist, a rep for Mylan would only say that the company continues to “work with the government to finalize the settlement as soon as possible.” May 31, 2017 By Chris Morran@themorrancave that's a lot of epipens epipen medicaid drug prices generic drugs Tell a friend: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Related gaming the system Senators Ask DOJ To Investigate Mylan Over Possible EpiPen Medicaid Fraud epi-expensive Report: Defense Department Overpaid $54 Million For EpiPens not quite settled Mylan To Pay $465M To Settle EpiPen Medicaid Pricing Scandal; Critics Call Deal “Inadequate” crime might pay Sen.

Send your hot, dry tips to spage@thinkprogress.org May 31 Exxon shareholders vote to force company to disclose climate risks In a first, the oil and gas giant will be forced to consider risks to its assets as the world moves to a low-carbon future. CREDIT: AP Photo/Mark Humphrey In a surprise victory for climate advocates, 62 percent of Exxon shareholders voted in favor of a resolution requiring the oil and gas giant to report how its business will be affected by global efforts to address climate change and keep warming to below 2ºC (3.6ºF). The vote came at Exxon’s annual meeting Thursday, just hours after it was reported that the United States would likely leave the Paris climate agreement, in which nearly every country has committed to lower emissions in an effort to meet a less-than 2ºC goal. “The need for extractive companies to provide disclosure on the resilience of their portfolios to the transition to a low carbon economy is generally established,” the proposal authors wrote. “This resolution aims to ensure that ExxonMobil fully evaluates and discloses to investors risk to the viability of its assets as a result of the transition to a low carbon economy.” The resolution’s passage was lauded by activist investors, who have been trying for years to get the company to address risk to the company’s assets in the face of global efforts to combat climate change. Last year, none of the four climate-related resolutions passed. Before this year’s vote, new Exxon CEO Darren Woods told shareholders that the board recommended against the resolution but that the company was already considering the impact of climate-related regulations. “We believe the risks of climate change are serious and warrant action — thoughtful action,” Woods said. “As a company, we are taking action in many ways, including in investing in technology.” He said the board “agrees it is important to reflect both policy and technological development in our long-term projections,” before going on to advise against the resolution. Court orders Exxon to hand over documents related to decades of climate misinformation There’s a better way to get information from the oil and gas giant than a Senate deposition of the former CEO.thinkprogress.org Major investment firms reportedly voted against the board and in favor of the resolution. New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli, a trustee of the New York Common Retirement Fund which co-sponsored the proxy resolution, called the win “an unprecedented victory.” “Climate change is one of the greatest long-term risks we face in our portfolio and has direct impact on the core business of ExxonMobil,” DiNapoli said in a statement. Climate change is one of the greatest long-term risks we face Exxon has come under fire — and is currently under investigation by two state attorneys general — for failing to disclose what it knew about climate risk as far back as the 1970s and for funding public campaigns to sow doubt about the reality of climate change. The company’s former CEO Rex Tillerson has been implicated in the investigation. Thursday’s climate resolution was presented by Edward Mason, head of responsible investment at Church Commissioners for England, which manages the Church of England’s endowments. Mason called out members of the board by name —including former CEOs of Johnson and Johnson, Merck, and Xerox, all of which have made climate commitments. “Members of the board, do you leave your understanding of climate change at the door when you attend an ExxonMobil board meeting?” Mason asked. Another climate resolution, on methane emissions, was presented by another person of faith, Sister Patricia Daly, a longtime activist investor at Exxon. She said there is “an incredible moral imperative” to bringing energy access to those who live in energy poverty, but to do so in way that doesn’t jeopardize long-term climate stability. The resolution to disclose methane leaks only received 38.7 percent of the vote. The resolutions brought out some well known anti-climate advocates. Steve Milloy, the author of a site called Junk Science, spoke during the comments section of the meeting. Calling the issue a “climate hoax,” Milloy said that people like him were responsible for putting President Trump in office and criticized Exxon for kowtowing to climate activists. “My message to Exxon management is this: Stop aiding and abetting the enemies of your shareholders,” he said. Milloy also criticized Woods’ support of the global agreement to curb warming, calling it the “economically suicidal Paris accord.” Tillerson, now serving as Trump’s Secretary of State, has also said he supports the Paris climate agreement. Despite this, it has been widely reported that the Trump administration will pull the United States out of the global agreement.

Home > News By Company > Market Data Forecast Tweet   Middle-East & Africa Veterinary Vaccines Market Research Report 2021 The Middle East and Africa Veterinary Vaccines Market by Type, by Technology and by Region - Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecasts (20162021)   Browse And Choose From Our World Class Research Reports (EMAILWIRE.COM, May 31, 2017 ) According to the report  Middle-East & Africa Veterinary Vaccines Market , published by Market Data Forecast, the Middle-East & Africa market projected to reach USD 455.17 Million by 2021, at a CAGR of 5.48% from 2016 to 2021 Veterinary Vaccines are important and, at times, control of a given animal disease or essential tools for prevention, but they require complementary actions like investment for diagnostic, enabling legislation, early response, public communication etc. The growing demand for livestock products (increased urbanization, fueled by population growth, and greater purchasing power of individuals in developing or middle- income countries) coupled with the necessity of complying with the standards of trade agreements, mean that governments in the Middle-East & Africa region must improve animal health in their countries. Free sample of the report is available at http://www.marketdataforecast.com/market-reports/middle-east-and-africa-veterinary-vaccines-market-84/request-sample Veterinary vaccine market has shown significant raise in recent years which can be attributed to growing incidences of animal pandemics in the region. Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia is endemic in numerous areas of Africa, and is suspected to occur occasionally in the Middle East. Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an insect-borne, multi-species zoonotic viral disease of livestock has been exclusively conﬁned to the African continent, but it began spreading to Middle-East in the past decade. This leads to estimation of further growth in the market in terms of livestock vaccine sales. However, regional and International collaboration has proven successful in the progressive control of these pandemics, e.g. the work of the Pan American Foot-and-Mouth Disease Centre in South America and the European Union FMD Commission which this region lacks. It makes adoption of regulations that much harder in the area. Increasing maintenance costs for the storage of vaccines, raising adoption of vegetarian diet in key economies owing to increasing risk of obesity and other chronic diseases are major constraints of this market.

AlphaGo beat the Chinese champion in each of the games at the Future of Go Summit, including one by the closest margin possible, half a point. DeepMind, the London-based firm behind the program, will now develop a teaching tool using AlphaGo’s analysis of Go positions. Researchers behind the program will also concentrate on developing advanced general algorithms, such as those that could help to find cures for diseases, said the Google-owned company. Peer review immortalized in concrete A Russian university unveiled the world’s first monument to peer review on 26 May. The 1.5‑tonne tribute (pictured) at the Higher School of Economics (HSE) in Moscow consists of a derelict concrete block fashioned into a die, displaying on its five visible sides the possible results of review — ‘Accept’, ‘Minor Changes’, ‘Major Changes’, ‘Revise and Resubmit’ and ‘Reject’. The director of the HSE’s Institute of Education asked his faculty last year for ideas about how to turn the block into something meaningful. A suggestion by HSE sociologist Igor Chirikov to turn it into a ‘monument to an anonymous peer reviewer’ struck a chord, gathering US$2,500 in funding from an Internet campaign. The work is also carved with the titles of 21 papers, most by the researchers who made the largest contributions to the campaign. Dari Drozhzhina Private launch pad Aerospace company Rocket Lab of Huntington Beach, California, sent its Electron rocket into suborbital space on 25 May from New Zealand’s North Island — the world’s first orbital-class launch from a private facility, and the first such launch from the island nation. The rocket did not make it all the way to orbit as planned. As a relatively small vehicle, it is intended to put payloads of up to 150 kilograms into orbit. Rocket Lab hopes to provide commercial launch services for Earth-imaging and space-exploration companies. Copyright trial A Colombian biologist who endured a criminal trial for posting another scientist’s thesis online has been cleared of copyright violation — an offence that, under Colombia’s strict rights laws, could have been punishable by up to eight years in prison. In 2011, Diego Gómez Hoyos uploaded a scientist’s 2006 thesis on amphibian taxonomy to the document-sharing network Scribd, hoping to help fellow students. But two years later, he was notified that the author of the thesis was suing him, beginning a lengthy trial. Gómez, who is 29 years old, was handed down his not-guilty verdict on 24 May by a judge in Bogotá; the prosecutor in the case has appealed the decision. SPACE Mars crash report The European Space Agency (ESA) Mars test lander Schiaparelli crashed last October as a result of conflicting information in the craft’s on-board computer, an independent investigation commissioned by the agency has concluded. The craft — designed to test European landing technology — crashed into Mars at a speed of around 540 kilometres per hour. The inquiry found that the problem originated when a rotation sensor exceeded its maximum capability, leading software to incorrectly estimate the craft’s orientation. Combined with radar measurements, this caused the computer to calculate that it was below ground level and to abort its deceleration procedure when it was still 3.7 km from the surface. The agency would “take the lessons learned” in preparing for the ExoMars 2020 rover mission, said David Parker, ESA’s director of human space flight and robotic exploration, in a statement. Jupiter up close NASA’s Juno spacecraft has revealed Jupiter as a much more complex and mysterious planet than researchers had thought. Beginning with the first of its close fly-bys last August, Juno found clusters of storms around Jupiter’s north and south poles; a plume of ammonia gas welling up from within the planet’s depths; and a magnetic field both stronger and more patchy than models had predicted. Early results also suggest that Jupiter has a large but poorly defined core of heavy elements. The findings appear in a suite of papers published last week in Science and in Geophysical Research Letters. See go.nature.com/2r5yrum for a full list of papers. PEOPLE New WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, a public-health expert from Ethiopia, will be the next director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO) — the agency’s first chief to hail from Africa. Tedros won a 23 May vote by WHO member states and will take up the post on 1 July for a five-year term, succeeding Margaret Chan. He has previously served as Ethiopia’s health minister and foreign minister, and takes the helm in troubled times: the WHO’s core budget — its contributions from its members — is falling, and the agency has been criticized for its complex, bureaucratic and ineffective management structure. Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty FACILITIES LHC fires up again Experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) began collecting data again on 23 May, kicking off the third operating run since the machine started up in 2009. The LHC at CERN, Europe’s particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland, is the world’s most powerful accelerator; it had been closed for technical upgrades since December. In 2017, engineers hope to achieve the same number of proton–proton collisions as they did in 2016 — a record 7 quadrillion (1015) — although over a slightly shorter period. The experiments will study known particles as well as searching for rare and new phenomena beyond the standard model of particle physics. POLITICS US science budget US President Donald Trump released a revised budget plan on 23 May that would slash science spending across the federal government in 2018. His planned cuts include 18% at the National Institutes of Health and 30% at the Environmental Protection Agency. PHARMACEUTICALS Biomarker drugs The US Food and Drug Administration on 23 May issued its first approval of a cancer drug that targets tumours with specific genetic mutations, or ‘biomarkers’, regardless of where in the body the tumour first took root. The agency previously required individual approvals for a drug to be deployed in different tumour locations, even if its use was linked to a specific marker. The new approach allows a compound called pembrolizumab to be used in any solid tumour that has a particular defect in its ability to repair damaged DNA. The compound is made by Merck of Kenilworth, New Jersey. ENERGY Methane cuts The Canadian government announced regulations on 25 May to curb methane emissions from the oil and gas industry. The proposal would require the industry to reduce leaks and minimize venting during production and transportation, and is a step towards Canada’s pledge to cut methane emissions by 40–45% by 2025, compared with 2012 levels. Methane accounts for roughly 15% of the country’s greenhouse-gas emissions, and its oil and gas sector is responsible for nearly half of the total. The rules would be phased in from 2020, although environmentalists are pushing for an earlier start date. TREND WATCH The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is on track to have a bumper year for new drug approvals. It has already approved 21 drugs in 2017, nearing the 2016 total of 22. That number was unusually small — less than half of the 2015 total — and sparked concerns about the pharmaceutical industry’s new-drug pipelines. This year’s rebound, and the appointment of FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb last month, could put those fears to rest. Gottlieb has pledged to speed up drug approvals.

The fixed dose combination of integrase strand inhibitor bictegravir with the two active ingredients in Descovy - emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide - met its main objective of non-inferiority to ViiV Healthcare's Triumeq, which contains rival integrase Tivicay (dolutegravir) as well as abacavir and lamivudine. Two studies pitted the two drug combinations head to head, while another two found patients were able to switch from ViiV's drug to Gilead's with no loss of viral suppression. Detailed data from the studies will be reported later in the year. The new data represents an opportunity for Gilead to stage a comeback in the HIV category, where it has been losing market share to ViiV due to the success of Tivicay and Triumeq, which grew more than 80% to reach £2.7bn ($3.5bn) in sales last year. The strong uptake of ViiV's drugs comes on the back of what is viewed as a superior profile for dolutegravir compared to Gilead's current integrase inhibitor elvitegravir - found in its Genvoya and Stribild products - which needs to be boosted with cobicistat. With bictegravir Gilead reckons it can get back on to firmer footing, and the company says it plans to quickly move forward with a US filing this quarter and a European application next quarter, claiming the new combination "represents an important advance in triple-therapy treatment for a broad range of HIV patients". Analysts at Leerink agree. They are predicting sales of $10bn thanks to the combination's "convenience, safety and tolerability and efficacy", and they also think Gilead will use an FDA priority review voucher to get the drug to market in the US as quickly as possible. Gilead needs a win at the moment due to sales of its hepatitis C blockbusters starting to slide as the available pool of eligible patients gets smaller, as well as combination from other drugs developed by the likes of AbbVie and Merck & Co. Descovy was cleared by regulators in the US and EU last year for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and children aged 12 and older, and forms the backbone of Gilead's new generation of HIV drugs. The drug is an upgrade to Truvada, which combined emtricitabine with an older and less potent tenofovir salt (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) that is heading for patent expiry. The combination of TAF - which is considered a best-in-class non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor - and bictegravir are key to Gilead's fightback against an encroaching ViiV in HIV, according to analysts at Cowen & Co. The firm cites HIV consultants who have suggested that even if bictegravir is deemed to be equivalent to ViiV's dolutegravir in terms of both efficacy and safety, then bictegravir plus Descovy will become their go-to regimen.

The drugs combined in the single dosage form contributes to the synergistic effects claimed by each of the drug. The number of doses of the single dose therapy can be increased or decreased, but the therapy does not involving altering of API proportion in the dosage form. These are administered in the form of a vial, capsules, tablets or patch. Single-dose therapy market can be segmented based on disease indication, application, distribution channel, and geography. Based on disease indication, the market can be segmented into cancer, HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, neurological disorders, psychological disorders, and microbial infections, among others. On the basis of application, single-dose therapy market can be segmented into human health and animal health. Hospitals, ambulatory centers, clinics, and pharmacies form the major distribution channels for the market. Based on geography, the market can be segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Middle East and Africa. Obtain Report Details: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/single-dose-therapy-ma… Increasing demand due to the synergistic effects provided by the combined fixed dose API’s administered as a single dose is the major driver for the single-dose therapy market. Further, the simpler treatment regime, convenience of administration, and the cost saving offered by single-dose therapy are also expected to drive the market growth. Additional benefits include the combined pharmacokinetics of the component drugs employed in the single dose, and enhanced medication compliance. However, the dosage of the APIs in the single-dose cannot be modified according to the patient requirements, which might negatively impact the growth of the market. In addition, the adverse side effects caused by the component drugs, the allergic reactions from any of the component drugs in the single dose therapy cannot be avoided, which might have an impact on the patient health, and a negative effect on the market growth. Also, the growing over-the-counter sale of various non-approved fixed dose combinations administered as single dose, would adversely affect the market. The increasing incidence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and various forms of cancer in all the geographies would drive the demand for single-dose therapies and contribute to the growth of the market. Geographically, North America is the largest market for single-dose therapy, followed by Europe. The growing geriatric population, and increased focus on research and development of effective single dose therapies has been driving the use of single-dose therapies. In addition, the growing FDA approvals of new single-dose therapies would contribute to the growth of the market. For instance, in November 2015, the U.S. FDA approved Genvoya, a single dosage form of various combination drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.

Meet the Contributors → On ASCO’s Eve, Experts Fret Over Backlash to Cancer Combo Frenzy Ben Fidler May 30th, 2017 @benthefidler @xconomy Like Us Xconomy National —  When thousands of cancer researchers from around the world gather in Chicago this weekend for the American Society of Clinical Oncology’s annual meeting, drugs that fight tumors by boosting a patient’s immune system will take center stage, as they have in previous years. But the stage is more crowded, as researchers have begun in earnest combining these immunotherapies into experimental cocktails, hoping to push quickly past the limits of the drugs currently in use as single agents. With the frenzy to test combinations, some of immunotherapy’s biggest champions now worry that the field is moving too fast; that studies are not being designed with enough care; and that the glut of combination trials—some estimates put the number north of 1,000 at the moment—is bound to provoke a backlash. Companies are committing huge sums of money to big clinical studies “based literally on [earlier] 20-patient results, because the field is so competitive,” says Drew Pardoll, the director of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy. With such flimsy foundations, says Pardoll, “my concern is that the ratio of trials that fail to the ratio of trials that succeed is going to be too high, and there will be a lot of pullback in investment. And that will result in the baby being thrown out with the bathwater.” This concern comes from a true believer. In the same interview, Pardoll says, “I’m convinced that overall we can at least double the number of cancer patients that immunotherapy can capture” with combinations. Others are sounding similar alarms. “Cancer immunotherapy has its own rules that are different from the rules of normal physics,” says James Sabry, Genentech’s senior vice president of partnering. Genentech and its parent Roche are deeply invested in immunotherapy. Their drug atezolizumab (Tecentriq) has already been approved for certain bladder and lung cancers and is currently part of at least 50 combination trials, according to clinicaltrials.gov. Immunotherapy “is going to come back down to reality,” Sabry says. To be sure, any new promising biomedical field will attract over-speculation by investors and a rush to capitalize by researchers and developers. And immunotherapy is promising, by any measure. Drugs called checkpoint inhibitors, which disrupt “checkpoint” proteins that tumors use to hide from the immune system, are changing the way a few cancers are treated. Six of these drugs have been approved for skin, lung, bladder, and other cancers, and in some cases they’ve produced uncharacteristically long-lasting results for patients at death’s door. They’ve already produced billions of dollars in revenue—the two leaders, nivolumab (Opdivo, from Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY)) and pembrolizumab (Keytruda, from Merck (NYSE: MRK)) generated about $2.7 billion combined in 2016—with billions more at stake. But a majority of patients still don’t respond to them. In the rush to solve those puzzles, some see familiar patterns. At last year’s ASCO meeting, Anthony Tolcher, the director of clinical research at South Texas Accelerated Research Therapeutics, wondered about “a worrisome bubble.” He compared immunotherapy’s early success to that of cisplatin chemotherapy in the 1970s, which after an initial breakthrough was followed by “incremental improvements” over many years. Independent investor Brad Loncar is so bullish on immunotherapy he created the world’s first index fund for the field: the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF (NASDAQ: CNCR). He isn’t fazed by the bubble talk. There will be high profile failures, just as there have been with single-agent programs, but he doesn’t think “bad results will chill future investment,” he says. With several kinds of immunotherapy making progress, such as live T cells and vaccines, “the underlying science is too promising to not get funded.” Promising science has a way of smacking into unexpected obstacles of biology, however. Despite recent advances, researchers are only scratching the surface of the complexity of the human immune system—and how it interacts with tumors that have their own genetic complexities and survival mechanisms. While large companies can afford to run a massive number of trials and deal with a few failures along the way, smaller biotechs vying for their attention have to think more strategically. Take Cambridge, MA, biotech Checkmate Pharmaceuticals, which is testing a drug, CMP-001, in combination with pembrolizumab. Mike Powell, a general partner at Sofinnova Partners and a Checkmate investor, says the company is trying CMP-001 in melanoma patients who are failing treatment with pembrolizumab because that trial is a “really tough test” and turning these patients’ disease around isn’t easy. “But when you see it, you know it is your drug doing it,” Powell says. The only FDA-approved immunotherapy combination so far—two Bristol drugs, ipiliumab (Yervoy, which blocks the protein CTLA-4) and nivolumab (which inhibits PD-1)—provided a modest survival benefit for melanoma patients over nivolumab alone with significantly more safety problems, including side effects that were unexpected—such as the onset of diabetes. There are other examples: Patients developed … Next Page » Single PageCurrently on Page: 1 2 Ben Fidler is Xconomy's Deputy Biotechnology Editor.

(ALBO) rose 14% on Tuesday, following completion of its $51.9 million public offering including exercise of underwriters' option to purchase additional shares. The Company's lead product candidate A4250 is all set to enter phase III study in patients with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) in the second half of 2017. Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis is a disorder that causes progressive liver disease, which typically leads to liver failure. (Source: Genetics Home Reference). In a recently completed open label Phase 2 clinical trial in children with cholestatic liver diseases, most patients showed both an improvement in pruritus (severe itching) across multiple scales and a reduction in serum bile acid levels after four weeks of treatment with A4250. ALBO closed Tuesday's trading at $20.44, up 14.00%. The FDA has approved the first generic versions of Strattera to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in pediatric and adult patients. Apotex Inc., Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc., Aurobindo Pharma Limited and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Limited are the companies that have been given the go-ahead to market generic versions of Strattera in multiple strengths. Strattera, developed by Eli Lilly and Company (LLY), recorded sales of $854.7 million in 2016. LLY closed Tuesday's trading at $78.35, up 0.38%. GlycoMimetics Inc. (GLYC) has closed its underwritten public offering of 8.05 million shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $11.50 per share, including exercise of underwriters' option to purchase additional shares. The aggregate gross proceeds to GlycoMimetics from the offering were approximately $92.6 million. Read our Company Spotlight column to know more about GlycoMimetics.

The da Vinci X System will provide surgeons and hospitals with access to some of the most advanced robotic-assisted surgery technology at a lower cost.

Meanwhile, Rose Alinaya, currently the company's Senior Vice President and Principal Accounting Officer, has been named Acting Chief Financial Officer until a permanent CFO is appointed. MNKD closed Tuesday's trading at $1.65, up 8.55%. The FDA has approved Merck's (MRK) ISENTRESS HD, a new 1200 mg once-daily dose, as a new once-daily option, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in appropriate patients.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 31 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Anticoagulants Market to Witness Steady Expansion by 2021 Anticoagulants are used to eliminate the risk of blood clots in the body. Blood clots are formed when platelets stick together and proteins in the blood bind together to form a solid mass. Generally, blood clots play an important role in stopping external bleeding caused by any injury to the skin. However, when blood clots form in the blood vessels, they can be dangerous as they can block blood circulation. Blood clots in arteries or the heart can obstruct blood flow and cause a heart attack. Such clots in blood vessels in the brain can cause a stroke. Anticoagulants stop the platelets from adhering to one another and clotting proteins from binding together. These are commonly used in the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, atrial fibrillation, and managing high and moderate risk of stroke. To get the view of full report @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/market-research/anticoa… Anticoagulants are mainly categorized as herapins, warfarin, low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs), factor Xa inhibitors, and direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs). Heparin is an injectable anticoagulant widely used in hospitals for rapid anticoagulation. LMWHs are administered about twice a day as subcutaneous injections to treat DVT. These are more convenient to use than heparins, as LMWHs can be self injected at home. Warfarin is usually prescribed as part of long-term anticoagulant therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation to help reduce the risk of stroke by more than 60%. The global anticoagulants market is categorized based on various types of anticoagulant drugs and applications. Based on types of anticoagulants, the report covers Betrixaban, Dabigatran (Pradaxa), Edoxaban, Rivaroxaban (Xarelto), and Eliquis (Apixaban). The application segment is further sub segmented into cardiovascular diseases, coronary artery diseases, cardiac arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, DVT, and heart valve replacement. A sample of this report is available upon request @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/4090 In terms of geography, North America dominates the global anticoagulants market. This is due to increased awareness about therapeutic applications of anticoagulants in disease management in the region. The U.S. represents the largest market for anticoagulants in North America, followed by Canada. In Europe, Germany, France and the U.K. hold major shares of the anticoagulants market. The anticoagulant market in Asia too, is expected to show high growth rates in the next five years. This is because a lot of companies are setting up manufacturing facilities in the region. Moreover, the growing population is also driving the growth of the market in the region. India, China, and Japan are expected to be the fastest growing markets for anticoagulants in Asia. The increasing aging population is a key driver for the global anticoagulants market. Also, increasing investment in R&D in the pharmaceutical sector and the introduction of innovative oral anticoagulants drugs have fueled the growth of this market. However, stringent regulations set by various governments hamper the growth of the global anticoagulants market. Moreover, risk of side-effects and complications associated with the usage of oral anticoagulants also hinders growth of the global anticoagulants market. Increasing number of mergers and acquisitions of drug manufacturing companies is a key trend of the global anticoagulants market. To view TOC of this report is available upon request @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/toc/4090 The major companies operating in this market are Abbott Laboratories, Baxter International Inc., Astrazeneca plc, Bayer AG, BioVascular Inc., Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Eli Lilly and Company, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Merck & Co., Inc., Genentech Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Pfizer, Inc., Sanofi, and Novartis AG.
