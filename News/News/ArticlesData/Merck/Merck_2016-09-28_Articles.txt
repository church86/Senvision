This announcement comes one year after the international coalition, formed by The Carter Center, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), WHO and Merck’s MECTIZAN Donation Program, urged for the final push to eliminate onchocerciasis from the Americas. The government of Guatemala worked in partnership with the MECTIZAN Donation Program, PAHO, WHO and The Carter Center’s Onchocerciasis Elimination Program for the Americas (OEPA), to eliminate onchocerciasis – one of the leading causes of preventable blindness worldwide – using MECTIZAN [®] (ivermectin), donated by Merck. With this verification, four of the six countries in the Americas historically at-risk for river blindness have verified elimination of the disease. “We celebrate this important achievement with the people of Guatemala. River blindness is a debilitating disease that affects individuals and their families, as well as the larger health care system and the economy,” said Kenneth C. Frazier, chairman and chief executive officer of Merck. “Until river blindness is entirely eliminated around the world, we remain committed to working with our partners in the fight against this preventable disease.” For more information, please read the following: PAHO/WHO Announcement The Carter Center Announcement About the MECTIZAN Donation Program In October 1987, Merck announced it would donate the medication MECTIZAN to all who need it for as long as necessary until river blindness is eliminated as a public health problem. The MECTIZAN Donation Program reaches more than 100 million people annually for river blindness. In Latin America, since 1989, more than 11 million treatments of donated MECTIZAN have been delivered by community health workers and non-governmental organizations. Learn more at www.mectizan.org.

More and more, it is a concept that will be part of everyday management. To help cattle producers in that regard, Merck Animal Health has launched a new app, the Meat Sustainability Calculator, which is designed to help producers, suppliers and others in the food chain better understand how the beef production systems and technologies they use impact the environment. The app was created in partnership with Jude Capper, Ph.D., an independent sustainability consultant. Data from peer-reviewed journals was utilized to establish a standard of the environmental impact of North American beef production practices. The app enables users to evaluate their own impact on sustainability by comparing their results to the North American average. Producers and suppliers can compare on a per-head-of-cattle scenario, while food service members or retailers can assess based on amount of beef produced or purchased. Users simply enter the number of cattle they desire to evaluate, or the pounds or kilograms of beef they will be supplying or purchasing. Next, they select various production technologies to determine how they impact sustainability. By comparing individual results to industry benchmarks, individuals can identify opportunities to improve the sustainability of their operations through things such as water usage and land management. “We are excited about this app, as it is unique to the industry – helping those in the beef supply chain realize the impact of their current production methods,” said Jennie Hodgen, Ph.D., Senior Account Manager, Veterinary and Consumer Affairs Team, Merck Animal Health. “Regardless of a person’s role in the chain, the calculator helps assess an operation’s greenhouse gas emissions, as well as water and land usage. Armed with this data, users can be more mindful of their environmental footprint by making a conscious effort to use fewer natural resources to raise healthy animals.”   The app is available for download on tablets and iPads in both the Apple and Android app store.

About KEYTRUDA [®] (pembrolizumab) KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. KEYTRUDA is administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every three weeks for the approved indications. KEYTRUDA for injection is supplied in a 100 mg single use vial. KEYTRUDA Indications and Dosing Melanoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma at a dose of 2 mg/kg every three weeks. Lung Cancer KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors express PD-L1 as determined by an FDA-approved test with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy, at a dose of 2 mg/kg every three weeks. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. An improvement in survival or disease-related symptoms has not yet been established. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. Head and Neck Cancer KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.

These data will be highlighted in a poster discussion on Monday, 10 October 2016 from 11:00-12:00 CET at the ESMO Annual Congress 2016 in Copenhagen, Denmark. In patients with treatment-naïve advanced melanoma (n=19), updated data show a disease control rate (DCR) of 74 percent and an overall response rate (ORR) of 58 percent. All responses are confirmed and ongoing (median follow-up 42 weeks); median progression-free survival (PFS) has not been reached. "We are very pleased that after extended treatment and longer follow-up, these updated Phase 1 data for epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab demonstrate robust, durable clinical activity in patients with treatment-naïve advanced melanoma and reinforce the promise of IDO1 inhibition in combination with an anti-PD-1 therapy as an important component of immunotherapy," said Steven Stein, M.D., Incyte's Chief Medical Officer. Epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab was well-tolerated. The most common (=15%) all grade treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were fatigue, rash, arthralgia, pruritus, diarrhea and nausea. Grade =3 TRAEs were observed in 18% of patients; the most common were rash (8%) and increased lipase (3%). The ECHO-202 abstract was made available today on the ESMO Congress website at http://esmo.org/Conferences/ESMO-2016-Congress. The ECHO-202 poster is expected to be made available to attendees at the ESMO Congress on Friday, 7 October 2016, at which time the ECHO-202 poster will be made available via the Events and Presentations tab of the Investor section of www.incyte.com. Incyte will also host an investor conference call and webcast at 14:00 CET (8:00 a.m. ET) on 7 October 2016 which can be accessed via the Events and Presentations tab of the Investor section of www.incyte.com. About ECHO-202 (KEYNOTE-037) The ECHO-202 study (NCT02178722) is evaluating the safety and efficacy of epacadostat, Incyte's selective IDO1 inhibitor, in combination with pembrolizumab. Patients previously treated with anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 therapies were excluded from this trial. Enrollment is complete for the Phase 1 dose escalation (epacadostat 25, 50, 100 mg BID pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg IV Q3W and epacadostat 300 mg BID pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3W) and Phase 1 dose expansion (epacadostat 50, 100, and 300 mg BID pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3W) portions of the trial. Enrollment in the Phase 2 tumor-specific cohorts is ongoing. About ECHO The ECHO clinical trial program was established to investigate the efficacy and safety of epacadostat as a core component of combination therapy in oncology. Ongoing Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating epacadostat in combination with PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors collectively plan to enroll over 900 patients in a broad range of solid tumor types, as well as hematological malignancies. ECHO-301 (NCT02752074), a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating pembrolizumab in combination with epacadostat or placebo as first-line treatment for patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma, is also underway. ECHO-301 was initiated in June 2016 and initial data from this study are expected to be available in 2018. About Epacadostat (INCB024360) Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is a key immunosuppressive enzyme that modulates the anti-tumor immune response by promoting regulatory T cell generation and blocking effector T cell activation, thereby facilitating tumor growth by allowing cancer cells to avoid immune surveillance. Epacadostat is a first-in-class, highly potent and selective oral inhibitor of the IDO1 enzyme that reverses tumor-associated immune suppression and restores effective anti-tumor immune responses. In single-arm studies, the combination of epacadostat and immune checkpoint inhibitors has shown proof-of-concept in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. In these studies, epacadostat combined with the CTLA-4 inhibitor ipilimumab or the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab improved response rates compared with studies of the immune checkpoint inhibitors alone.

  coinciding with ESMO Merck, a leading science and technology company, today announced that new research from their marketed and pipeline compounds will be presented at this year's European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO; October 7-11, 2016, Copenhagen, Denmark) annual meeting. Presentations will focus on hard-to-treat cancers, and include: study results for Erbitux® (cetuximab) in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN); preliminary study results in bladder cancer and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) for avelumab, which is being developed in collaboration with Pfizer; and updates on the Phase II program for tepotinib* in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). "The data being presented at ESMO reflect our commitment to making a meaningful difference in patients' lives, in particular those who are affected by hard-to-treat cancers," said Luciano Rossetti, Executive Vice President, Head of Global Research & Development at the biopharma business of Merck. "We continue to focus on researching the full potential of Erbitux, as well as our ongoing pipeline development programs for avelumab and other early-stage oncology and immuno-oncology compounds." At ESMO, avelumab will be featured in four posters that add to the growing body of evidence of the potential of this investigational compound. These will include data updates in bladder cancer that confirm avelumab's potential in this hard-to-treat cancer; and preliminary results from a combination study with axitinib in RCC that support the rationale to evaluate the combination in a Phase III pivotal study. Tepotinib, a highly selective c-Met kinase inhibitor, will also be highlighted in three posters, with updates on the ongoing study program in c-Met-positive metastatic NSCLC. Several studies, which will be presented at ESMO, once again reaffirm Erbitux as a standard-of-care therapy for mCRC patients with RAS wild-type tumors and patients with SCCHN. Merck believes that to truly deliver the promise of innovation for patients, it is vital to support and encourage research from other endeavors. This is demonstrated through Merck's Grant for Oncology Innovation (GOI) initiative, which awards researchers for their pioneering independent work in pushing the boundaries of creativity and science in order to deliver transformative innovation. The award ceremony will once again coincide with ESMO and takes place on Sunday, October 9, 2016. *Tepotinib is the proposed nonproprietary name for the c-Met kinase inhibitor (also known as MSC2156119J). Avelumab and tepotinib are under clinical investigation and have not been proven to be safe and effective. There is no guarantee any product will be approved in the sought-after indication by any health authority worldwide. Notes to Editors Accepted Merck-supported abstracts are listed below. In addition, a number of investigator-sponsored studies have been accepted, including several related to Erbitux (not listed).

About Avelumab Avelumab (also known as MSB0010718C) is an investigational, fully human antibody specific for a protein found on tumor cells called PD-L1, or programmed death ligand-1. Avelumab is thought to have a dual mechanism of action which may enable the immune system to find and attack cancer cells. By binding to PD-L1, avelumab is thought to prevent tumor cells from using PD-L1 for protection against white blood cells such as T-cells, exposing them to anti-tumor responses. Avelumab is also thought to help white blood cells such as natural killer (NK) cells find and attack tumors in a process known as ADCC, or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In November 2014, Merck and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab. About Erbitux Erbitux® is a highly active IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). As a monoclonal antibody, the mode of action of Erbitux is distinct from standard non-selective chemotherapy treatments in that it specifically targets and binds to the EGFR. This binding inhibits the activation of the receptor and the subsequent signal-transduction pathway, which results in reducing both the invasion of normal tissues by tumor cells and the spread of tumors to new sites. It is also believed to inhibit the ability of tumor cells to repair the damage caused by chemotherapy and radiotherapy and to inhibit the formation of new blood vessels inside tumors, which appears to lead to an overall suppression of tumor growth. The most commonly reported side effect with Erbitux is an acne-like skin rash. In approximately 5% of patients, hypersensitivity reactions may occur during treatment with Erbitux; about half of these reactions are severe. Erbitux has already obtained market authorization in over 90 countries world-wide for the treatment of colorectal cancer and for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Merck licensed the right to market Erbitux outside the US and Canada from ImClone LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company, in 1998. Merck has an ongoing commitment to the advancement of oncology treatment and is currently investigating novel therapies in highly targeted areas. About Tepotinib Tepotinib (also known as MSC2156119J) is an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase capable of inhibiting both hepatocyte growth factor-dependent and -independent c-MET activation in low nanomolar concentrations. Alterations of the c-Met signaling pathway are found in various cancer types and correlate with aggressive tumor behavior and poor clinical prognosis. Tepotinib is currently under evaluation in Phase I/II trials. About Merck Merck is a leading science and technology company in healthcare, life science and performance materials. Around 50,000 employees work to further develop technologies that improve and enhance life - from biopharmaceutical therapies to treat cancer or multiple sclerosis, cutting-edge systems for scientific research and production, to liquid crystals for smartphones and LCD televisions.

967P, 994P; Tepotinib: 1257P, 1287TiP, 1292TiP  Merck to feature new research from marketed and pipeline compounds   Preliminary results from combination study with avelumab in renal cell carcinoma, and updates on Phase II tepotinib program in non-small cell lung cancer, to be presented   Merck to announce 2016 Grant for Oncology Innovation winners coinciding with ESMO Merck, a leading science and technology company, today announced that new research from their marketed and pipeline compounds will be presented at this year's European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO; October 7-11, 2016, Copenhagen, Denmark) annual meeting. Presentations will focus on hard-to-treat cancers, and include: study results for Erbitux® (cetuximab) in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN); preliminary study results in bladder cancer and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) for avelumab, which is being developed in collaboration with Pfizer; and updates on the Phase II program for tepotinib* in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). "The data being presented at ESMO reflect our commitment to making a meaningful difference in patients' lives, in particular those who are affected by hard-to-treat cancers," said Luciano Rossetti, Executive Vice President, Head of Global Research & Development at the biopharma business of Merck. "We continue to focus on researching the full potential of Erbitux, as well as our ongoing pipeline development programs for avelumab and other early-stage oncology and immuno-oncology compounds." At ESMO, avelumab will be featured in four posters that add to the growing body of evidence of the potential of this investigational compound. These will include data updates in bladder cancer that confirm avelumab's potential in this hard-to-treat cancer; and preliminary results from a combination study with axitinib in RCC that support the rationale to evaluate the combination in a Phase III pivotal study. Tepotinib, a highly selective c-Met kinase inhibitor, will also be highlighted in three posters, with updates on the ongoing study program in c-Met-positive metastatic NSCLC. Several studies, which will be presented at ESMO, once again reaffirm Erbitux as a standard-of-care therapy for mCRC patients with RAS wild-type tumors and patients with SCCHN. Merck believes that to truly deliver the promise of innovation for patients, it is vital to support and encourage research from other endeavors. This is demonstrated through Merck's Grant for Oncology Innovation (GOI) initiative, which awards researchers for their pioneering independent work in pushing the boundaries of creativity and science in order to deliver transformative innovation. The award ceremony will once again coincide with ESMO and takes place on Sunday, October 9, 2016. *Tepotinib is the proposed nonproprietary name for the c-Met kinase inhibitor (also known as MSC2156119J). Avelumab and tepotinib are under clinical investigation and have not been proven to be safe and effective. There is no guarantee any product will be approved in the sought-after indication by any health authority worldwide. Notes to Editors  Accepted Merck-supported abstracts are listed below.

About Avelumab   Avelumab (also known as MSB0010718C) is an investigational, fully human antibody specific for a protein found on tumor cells called PD-L1, or programmed death ligand-1. Avelumab is thought to have a dual mechanism of action which may enable the immune system to find and attack cancer cells. By binding to PD-L1, avelumab is thought to prevent tumor cells from using PD-L1 for protection against white blood cells such as T-cells, exposing them to anti-tumor responses. Avelumab is also thought to help white blood cells such as natural killer (NK) cells find and attack tumors in a process known as ADCC, or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In November 2014, Merck and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab. About Erbitux  Erbitux® is a highly active IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). As a monoclonal antibody, the mode of action of Erbitux is distinct from standard non-selective chemotherapy treatments in that it specifically targets and binds to the EGFR. This binding inhibits the activation of the receptor and the subsequent signal-transduction pathway, which results in reducing both the invasion of normal tissues by tumor cells and the spread of tumors to new sites. It is also believed to inhibit the ability of tumor cells to repair the damage caused by chemotherapy and radiotherapy and to inhibit the formation of new blood vessels inside tumors, which appears to lead to an overall suppression of tumor growth. The most commonly reported side effect with Erbitux is an acne-like skin rash. In approximately 5% of patients, hypersensitivity reactions may occur during treatment with Erbitux; about half of these reactions are severe. Erbitux has already obtained market authorization in over 90 countries world-wide for the treatment of colorectal cancer and for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Merck licensed the right to market Erbitux outside the US and Canada from ImClone LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company, in 1998. Merck has an ongoing commitment to the advancement of oncology treatment and is currently investigating novel therapies in highly targeted areas. About Tepotinib  Tepotinib (also known as MSC2156119J) is an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase capable of inhibiting both hepatocyte growth factor-dependent and -independent c-MET activation in low nanomolar concentrations. Alterations of the c-Met signaling pathway are found in various cancer types and correlate with aggressive tumor behavior and poor clinical prognosis. Tepotinib is currently under evaluation in Phase I/II trials. About Merck  Merck is a leading science and technology company in healthcare, life science and performance materials. Around 50,000 employees work to further develop technologies that improve and enhance life - from biopharmaceutical therapies to treat cancer or multiple sclerosis, cutting-edge systems for scientific research and production, to liquid crystals for smartphones and LCD televisions. In 2015, Merck generated sales of €12.85 billion in 66 countries. Founded in 1668, Merck is the world's oldest pharmaceutical and chemical company. The founding family remains the majority owner of the publicly listed corporate group. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany holds the global rights to the Merck name and brand. The only exceptions are the United States and Canada, where the company operates as EMD Serono, MilliporeSigma and EMD Performance Materials.      (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160524/371574LOGO ) SOURCE Merck View Table Fullscreen View Table Fullscreen Journalists and Bloggers The news you need, when you need it.

Presentations will focus on hard-to-treat cancers, and include: study results for Erbitux(R) (cetuximab) in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN); preliminary study results in bladder cancer and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) for avelumab, which is being developed in collaboration with Pfizer; and updates on the Phase II program for tepotinib* in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). "The data being presented at ESMO reflect our commitment to making a meaningful difference in patients' lives, in particular those who are affected by hard-to-treat cancers," said Luciano Rossetti, Executive Vice President, Head of Global Research & Development at the biopharma business of Merck. "We continue to focus on researching the full potential of Erbitux, as well as our ongoing pipeline development programs for avelumab and other early-stage oncology and immuno-oncology compounds." At ESMO, avelumab will be featured in four posters that add to the growing body of evidence of the potential of this investigational compound. These will include data updates in bladder cancer that confirm avelumab's potential in this hard-to-treat cancer; and preliminary results from a combination study with axitinib in RCC that support the rationale to evaluate the combination in a Phase III pivotal study. Tepotinib, a highly selective c-Met kinase inhibitor, will also be highlighted in three posters, with updates on the ongoing study program in c-Met-positive metastatic NSCLC. Several studies, which will be presented at ESMO, once again reaffirm Erbitux as a standard-of-care therapy for mCRC patients with RAS wild-type tumors and patients with SCCHN. Merck believes that to truly deliver the promise of innovation for patients, it is vital to support and encourage research from other endeavors. This is demonstrated through Merck's Grant for Oncology Innovation (GOI) initiative, which awards researchers for their pioneering independent work in pushing the boundaries of creativity and science in order to deliver transformative innovation. The award ceremony will once again coincide with ESMO and takes place on Sunday, October 9, 2016. *Tepotinib is the proposed nonproprietary name for the c-Met kinase inhibitor (also known as MSC2156119J). Avelumab and tepotinib are under clinical investigation and have not been proven to be safe and effective. There is no guarantee any product will be approved in the sought-after indication by any health authority worldwide. Notes to Editors  Accepted Merck-supported abstracts are listed below. In addition, a number of investigator-sponsored studies have been accepted, including several related to Erbitux (not listed).

About Avelumab Avelumab (also known as MSB0010718C) is an investigational, fully human antibody specific for a protein found on tumor cells called PD-L1, or programmed death ligand-1. Avelumab is thought to have a dual mechanism of action which may enable the immune system to find and attack cancer cells. By binding to PD-L1, avelumab is thought to prevent tumor cells from using PD-L1 for protection against white blood cells such as T-cells, exposing them to anti-tumor responses. Avelumab is also thought to help white blood cells such as natural killer (NK) cells find and attack tumors in a process known as ADCC, or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In November 2014, Merck and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab. About Erbitux Erbitux® is a highly active IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). As a monoclonal antibody, the mode of action of Erbitux is distinct from standard non-selective chemotherapy treatments in that it specifically targets and binds to the EGFR. This binding inhibits the activation of the receptor and the subsequent signal-transduction pathway, which results in reducing both the invasion of normal tissues by tumor cells and the spread of tumors to new sites. It is also believed to inhibit the ability of tumor cells to repair the damage caused by chemotherapy and radiotherapy and to inhibit the formation of new blood vessels inside tumors, which appears to lead to an overall suppression of tumor growth. The most commonly reported side effect with Erbitux is an acne-like skin rash. In approximately 5% of patients, hypersensitivity reactions may occur during treatment with Erbitux; about half of these reactions are severe. Erbitux has already obtained market authorization in over 90 countries world-wide for the treatment of colorectal cancer and for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Merck licensed the right to market Erbitux outside the US and Canada from ImClone LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company, in 1998. Merck has an ongoing commitment to the advancement of oncology treatment and is currently investigating novel therapies in highly targeted areas. About Tepotinib Tepotinib (also known as MSC2156119J) is an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase capable of inhibiting both hepatocyte growth factor-dependent and -independent c-MET activation in low nanomolar concentrations. Alterations of the c-Met signaling pathway are found in various cancer types and correlate with aggressive tumor behavior and poor clinical prognosis. Tepotinib is currently under evaluation in Phase I/II trials. About Merck Merck is a leading science and technology company in healthcare, life science and performance materials. Around 50,000 employees work to further develop technologies that improve and enhance life - from biopharmaceutical therapies to treat cancer or multiple sclerosis, cutting-edge systems for scientific research and production, to liquid crystals for smartphones and LCD televisions. In 2015, Merck generated sales of EUR12.85 billion in 66 countries. Founded in 1668, Merck is the world's oldest pharmaceutical and chemical company. The founding family remains the majority owner of the publicly listed corporate group. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany holds the global rights to the Merck name and brand. The only exceptions are the United States and Canada, where the company operates as EMD Serono, MilliporeSigma and EMD Performance Materials.

Speaking at the event in Lagos, General Manager, Merck Nigeria, Charles Ajibo, who noted that the move was also to formally announced its presence, added: “Prior to 2014, Merck was represented in Nigeria by agents. So, all products of Merck are in Nigeria, but we are now present in Nigeria as Merck. We are re-launching our brands in order to re-establish the priorities to our country that these good, trusted and very verifiable products are still here in Nigeria.” He explained that Glucophage would be 60 years old by 2017, saying the drug had stood the test of time. Consultant physician with Asokoro General hospital, Abuja, Dr. Henry Onyegbutulem, commended the drug, adding: “I have used Glucovance for some time now and found it very useful on my patients. Its coming has made it very easy for our patients.” Chairman of the occasion and Head, Department of Medicine and an Endocrinologist, University of Ibadan, Professor Adesoji Fasanmade, highlighted the efficiency, affordability and availability of the drug, noting that this special category accounts for 90 per cent of diabetes patients nationwide. According to a Senior Lecturer, College of Medicine, University of Lagos and Honorary Consultant to the Lagos University Teaching Hospital,  (LUTH), Dr. Ifedayo Odeniyi, serious focus should be placed on the health insurance scheme, even as he urged government to subsidise healthcare and effectively monitor facilities in the country. He stressed that government does not have a big role to play in terms of education, adding: “We need to educate people in terms of prevention but when it comes to treatment, most of these medications are not manufactured here and when equipment are brought in, especially for monitoring, this increases the cost borne by the patients. This is where government needs to intervene in subsidising care in the form of tax rebate for the companies that bring in these equipment for monitoring.” Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share via Email In this article: Charles AjiboGlucovance and GlucophageMerck You may also like Government unveils strategy on ease of doing business 28 Sep 1  Nigeria Nigeria to emulate India on agric model, says Buhari 28 Sep  Nigeria Ohanaeze to mark Igbo day at secretariat 28 Sep 1  Nigeria More   Football 'New Vardy' set for Leicester return at Watford 26 mins ago   Guardiola seeks right gear at petering Palace 34 mins ago   Klopp confident Liverpool momentum is intact 52 mins ago   Wenger, Mourinho set for Old Trafford reunion 1 hour ago   Get the latest news and analysis of issues from Nigeria, Africa and around the world, direct into your inbox, daily Subscribe Now Top News Nigeria Africa World Metro Opinion Editorial Columnists Cartoons Business Appointments Business News Business RoundUp Industry Aviation Capital Market Communications Energy DrillBytes Maritime SweetCrude Infrastructure Money Technology Gadgets Telecoms Social Media Technology Sport Football Boxing Athletics Tennis Golf Arts Arts Art House Artfolk Revue Film Literature Music Theatre Visual Arts Features Policy & Politics BusinessAgro Education Executive Motoring Executive Briefs Focus Friday Worship Law Media Science Youth Speak Property Environment Mortgage Finance Real Estate Urban Development Guardian Woman Entrepreneurship GW Fiction Personality Issues WIMBIZ Saturday Magazine Youth Magazine Just Human Life & Style Love & Life Transition Travel & Tourism Celebrity Brand Intelligence Gardening Weekend Beats Sunday Magazine Ibru Ecumenical Centre Campus CityFile News Feature Living Healthy Diet Living Wellbeing Newspeople Aspire By Zenith Guardian TV News Opinion Fashion Sport Entertainment Science & Tech GTV Exclusive Guardian Life Home Lifestyle Showbiz Trending LS Diaries On The Cover The Guardian Home About Us Advertise With Us |     Powered by Ventra Copyright © 2016 Guardian Newspapers.

The first patient has been recruited in the VICTORIA trial of vericiguat, an oral soluble guanylate-cyclase (sGC) stimulator thought to work by correcting a dysfunctional nitric oxide signalling pathway seen in heart failure. The large (and likely expensive) trial will enrol a total of around 4,900 patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and compare vericiguat to placebo on top of standard treatment. It is due to generate results in 2020. The primary efficacy measure in the trial is the time to first occurrence of the composite endpoint of cardiovascular mortality or hospitalisation for heart failure. The decision to press ahead with vericiguat comes even though the drug produced a less-than-stellar performance in the phase II SOCRATES-REDUCED trial. Given at a range of doses, the drug failed to achieve its primary objective of achieving a significant reduction in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) a biomarker in patients with worsening HFrEF, although a subgroup given the highest dose (10mg) did show a benefit compared to placebo. According to the investigators in the trial, in HFrEF patients on 10mg vericiguat showed some improvements in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) as well as fewer clinical events than the placebo group. A second phase II trial of vericiguat in heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) - an even more hard-to-treat form of the disease - has yet to be announced even though the trial was completed last year. It is rumoured to have been discontinued in this indication. Bayer - which holds all rights to the drug outside the US - has previously said it expects vericiguat to bring in approximately €500m ($558m) in peak annual sales. Analysts at Credit Suisse have predicted 2020 sales of around $58m, with a 40% chance the drug will reach the market. Another new drug for HFrEF, Novartis' Entresto (sacubitril and valsartan) - has been predicted to become a $5bn product but is off to a slow start with sales of just $49m in the first half of the year. It is estimated that 1-2% of all adults in industrialised countries are affected by HF at the moment - and the incidence is predicted to rise sharply by 2030. It remains an invariably fatal condition however, with only half of patients still alive five years after diagnosis. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments.

New Delhi: Hilleman Laboratories, an initiative between pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co (MSD Pharmaceuticals in India) and UK-based charitable organization Wellcome Trust, is in talks to partner domestic and global vaccine companies to manufacture and market its thermostable, or heat-resistant, rotavirus vaccine in India. The research-based company, which largely works in the space of low-cost vaccines to prevent paediatric diseases in developing countries, is owned equally by both MSD and Wellcome Trust. “We are currently discussing potential partnerships with different pharmaceutical companies for our vaccines. Since Hilleman Labs does not have its own manufacturing unit, we are looking to explore other suitable arrangements,” said Dr Davinder Gill, chief executive officer, Hilleman Laboratories. Hilleman is presently developing vaccines to treat rotavirus, cholera and meningitis, with the rotavirus vaccine in the Phase I/II clinical trial stage. Domestically, there are a handful of vaccine manufacturing companies including Bharat Biotech Ltd, Indian Immunologicals Ltd, Serum Institute of India, Panacea Biotec Ltd, GSK Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Bharat Serums and Vaccines Ltd, and Shantha Biotechnics Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of French drugmaker Sanofi. Since the company’s primary focus is on developing countries, cost-effectiveness of the vaccines is one of the most important factors. A heat-stable rotavirus vaccine would eliminate the need for cold-storage facilities, driving down costs and partially removing logistical inefficiencies. Sample this. “The Rotavirus Vaccine should be stored at -20°C at GMSDs (government medical stores depot), state, regional and district stores, in the walk-in freezers or deep freezers. Cold chain points below district level should store vaccine at +2°C to +8°C, in ice-lined refrigerators. Rotavirus vaccine should be transported in cold boxes with conditioned ice-packs..,” dictates the operational guidelines for rotavirus vaccine under India’s immunization programme. Incidentally, the active ingredient for Hilleman’s rotavirus vaccine is sourced from Merck. “The partnership we seek for manufacturing vaccines will need to certainly be affordable and safe, which is our primary goal,” said Gill. Founded in 2009, MSD Pharmaceuticals and Wellcome Trust had invested about Rs.700 crore in the company. The company, however, is looking at long-term prospects of profitability by licencing out their innovation to others which can market vaccines, and a consequent revenue stream through milestone-based royalties. “We have no plans of setting up a manufacturing plant anytime soon. The road to profitability will take time—at least 3 to 4 years—so we are focusing on the priming our research pipeline along with leveraging our current research for revenues,” said Gill. Rotavirus, which causes severe diarrhoea, claims 80,000 children in India every year while nine lakh children seek hospitalisation. On an average, at least 32.7 lakh severe diarrhoea cases are received in outpatient departments in India annually.

Merck to Present New Research Focused on Hard-to-Treat Cancers at ESMO 2016 Merck to Present New Research Focused on Hard-to-Treat Cancers at ESMO 2016 CHIMICA E FARMACIA Tweet Condividi su WhatsApp Pubblicato il: 28/09/2016 08:27 DARMSTADT, Germany, September 28, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Not intended for UK- or US-based media   ESMO Abstract # Avelumab: 777PD, 775PD, 1154P, 842TiP, 844TiP; Erbitux: 527P, 491P, 967P, 994P; Tepotinib: 1257P, 1287TiP, 1292TiP  Merck, a leading science and technology company, today announced that new research from their marketed and pipeline compounds will be presented at this year's European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO; October 7-11, 2016, Copenhagen, Denmark) annual meeting. Presentations will focus on hard-to-treat cancers, and include: study results for Erbitux® (cetuximab) in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN); preliminary study results in bladder cancer and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) for avelumab, which is being developed in collaboration with Pfizer; and updates on the Phase II program for tepotinib* in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). "The data being presented at ESMO reflect our commitment to making a meaningful difference in patients' lives, in particular those who are affected by hard-to-treat cancers," said Luciano Rossetti, Executive Vice President, Head of Global Research & Development at the biopharma business of Merck. "We continue to focus on researching the full potential of Erbitux, as well as our ongoing pipeline development programs for avelumab and other early-stage oncology and immuno-oncology compounds." At ESMO, avelumab will be featured in four posters that add to the growing body of evidence of the potential of this investigational compound. These will include data updates in bladder cancer that confirm avelumab's potential in this hard-to-treat cancer; and preliminary results from a combination study with axitinib in RCC that support the rationale to evaluate the combination in a Phase III pivotal study. Tepotinib, a highly selective c-Met kinase inhibitor, will also be highlighted in three posters, with updates on the ongoing study program in c-Met-positive metastatic NSCLC. Several studies, which will be presented at ESMO, once again reaffirm Erbitux as a standard-of-care therapy for mCRC patients with RAS wild-type tumors and patients with SCCHN. Merck believes that to truly deliver the promise of innovation for patients, it is vital to support and encourage research from other endeavors. This is demonstrated through Merck's Grant for Oncology Innovation (GOI) initiative, which awards researchers for their pioneering independent work in pushing the boundaries of creativity and science in order to deliver transformative innovation. The award ceremony will once again coincide with ESMO and takes place on Sunday, October 9, 2016. *Tepotinib is the proposed nonproprietary name for the c-Met kinase inhibitor (also known as MSC2156119J). Avelumab and tepotinib are under clinical investigation and have not been proven to be safe and effective. There is no guarantee any product will be approved in the sought-after indication by any health authority worldwide. Notes to Editors  Accepted Merck-supported abstracts are listed below. In addition, a number of investigator-sponsored studies have been accepted, including several related to Erbitux (not listed).

About Avelumab   Avelumab (also known as MSB0010718C) is an investigational, fully human antibody specific for a protein found on tumor cells called PD-L1, or programmed death ligand-1. Avelumab is thought to have a dual mechanism of action which may enable the immune system to find and attack cancer cells. By binding to PD-L1, avelumab is thought to prevent tumor cells from using PD-L1 for protection against white blood cells such as T-cells, exposing them to anti-tumor responses. Avelumab is also thought to help white blood cells such as natural killer (NK) cells find and attack tumors in a process known as ADCC, or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In November 2014, Merck and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab. About Erbitux  Erbitux® is a highly active IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). As a monoclonal antibody, the mode of action of Erbitux is distinct from standard non-selective chemotherapy treatments in that it specifically targets and binds to the EGFR. This binding inhibits the activation of the receptor and the subsequent signal-transduction pathway, which results in reducing both the invasion of normal tissues by tumor cells and the spread of tumors to new sites. It is also believed to inhibit the ability of tumor cells to repair the damage caused by chemotherapy and radiotherapy and to inhibit the formation of new blood vessels inside tumors, which appears to lead to an overall suppression of tumor growth. The most commonly reported side effect with Erbitux is an acne-like skin rash. In approximately 5% of patients, hypersensitivity reactions may occur during treatment with Erbitux; about half of these reactions are severe. Erbitux has already obtained market authorization in over 90 countries world-wide for the treatment of colorectal cancer and for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Merck licensed the right to market Erbitux outside the US and Canada from ImClone LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company, in 1998. Merck has an ongoing commitment to the advancement of oncology treatment and is currently investigating novel therapies in highly targeted areas. About Tepotinib  Tepotinib (also known as MSC2156119J) is an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase capable of inhibiting both hepatocyte growth factor-dependent and -independent c-MET activation in low nanomolar concentrations. Alterations of the c-Met signaling pathway are found in various cancer types and correlate with aggressive tumor behavior and poor clinical prognosis. Tepotinib is currently under evaluation in Phase I/II trials. About Merck  Merck is a leading science and technology company in healthcare, life science and performance materials. Around 50,000 employees work to further develop technologies that improve and enhance life - from biopharmaceutical therapies to treat cancer or multiple sclerosis, cutting-edge systems for scientific research and production, to liquid crystals for smartphones and LCD televisions.

About Avelumab   Avelumab (also known as MSB0010718C) is an investigational, fully human antibody specific for a protein found on tumor cells called PD-L1, or programmed death ligand-1. Avelumab is thought to have a dual mechanism of action which may enable the immune system to find and attack cancer cells. By binding to PD-L1, avelumab is thought to prevent tumor cells from using PD-L1 for protection against white blood cells such as T-cells, exposing them to anti-tumor responses. Avelumab is also thought to help white blood cells such as natural killer (NK) cells find and attack tumors in a process known as ADCC, or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In November 2014, Merck and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab. About Erbitux  Erbitux(R) is a highly active IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). As a monoclonal antibody, the mode of action of Erbitux is distinct from standard non-selective chemotherapy treatments in that it specifically targets and binds to the EGFR. This binding inhibits the activation of the receptor and the subsequent signal-transduction pathway, which results in reducing both the invasion of normal tissues by tumor cells and the spread of tumors to new sites. It is also believed to inhibit the ability of tumor cells to repair the damage caused by chemotherapy and radiotherapy and to inhibit the formation of new blood vessels inside tumors, which appears to lead to an overall suppression of tumor growth. The most commonly reported side effect with Erbitux is an acne-like skin rash. In approximately 5% of patients, hypersensitivity reactions may occur during treatment with Erbitux; about half of these reactions are severe. Erbitux has already obtained market authorization in over 90 countries world-wide for the treatment of colorectal cancer and for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Merck licensed the right to market Erbitux outside the US and Canada from ImClone LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company, in 1998. Merck has an ongoing commitment to the advancement of oncology treatment and is currently investigating novel therapies in highly targeted areas. About Tepotinib  Tepotinib (also known as MSC2156119J) is an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase capable of inhibiting both hepatocyte growth factor-dependent and -independent c-MET activation in low nanomolar concentrations. Alterations of the c-Met signaling pathway are found in various cancer types and correlate with aggressive tumor behavior and poor clinical prognosis. Tepotinib is currently under evaluation in Phase I/II trials. About Merck  Merck is a leading science and technology company in healthcare, life science and performance materials. Around 50,000 employees work to further develop technologies that improve and enhance life - from biopharmaceutical therapies to treat cancer or multiple sclerosis, cutting-edge systems for scientific research and production, to liquid crystals for smartphones and LCD televisions. In 2015, Merck generated sales of EUR12.85 billion in 66 countries. Founded in 1668, Merck is the world's oldest pharmaceutical and chemical company. The founding family remains the majority owner of the publicly listed corporate group. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany holds the global rights to the Merck name and brand. The only exceptions are the United States and Canada, where the company operates as EMD Serono, MilliporeSigma and EMD Performance Materials.

In all, the epidemic spread to nine countries resulting in more than 27,000 confirmed cases and 11,000 deaths. The deadly virus not only continues to pose a threat to West African citizens, but to medical staff and warfighters deployed to the region. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency’s Joint Science and Technology Office led basic research for the first Ebola vaccine, which was granted emergency use authorization and deployed within the affected area. Recently, DTRA’s JSTO-funded Merck Ebola Vaccine, designated V920, moved closer to becoming a licensed vaccine available to protect the warfighters. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the vaccine breakthrough therapy designation, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) provided the vaccine PRIME (PRIority MEdicines) status. The FDA’s breakthrough therapy designation accelerates development and review of a drug candidate planned for use, alone or in combination, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Similarly, PRIME is an approach from the EMA to enhance support for the development of medicines that target an unmet medical need. PRIME is intended to optimize development plans and speed up evaluation so these medicines can reach patients quicker. This special status focuses on medicines that may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments or benefit patients without any other treatment options. To be accepted for PRIME, a medicine has to show its potential to benefit patients with unmet medical needs based on early clinical data. V920 was engineered by scientists from the Public Health Agency of Canada and subsequently licensed to a subsidiary of NewLink Genetics Corporation. DTRA funded NewLink Genetics to develop the vaccine, including funding critical animal efficacy studies, vaccine production and a human safety study at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. Merck then licensed V920 from NewLink Genetics to accelerate the development, licensure and availability of the vaccine. Since that time, the vaccine began a clinical development program with funding from the U.S. Government, including DTRA and the Biomedical Advanced Research Development Authority among others. Although research evaluating V920 is ongoing, data from a 2015 study conducted in Guinea by the World Health Organization, the Health Ministry of Guinea, Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders), Epicentre and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health reported 100 percent efficacy (95 percent confidence interval: 74.7 - 100 percent efficacy; p=0.0036) following vaccination with a single dose in vaccinated individuals. The study also reported that all vaccinated individuals appeared to be protected against the Ebola virus infection within six to 10 days of vaccination. The FDA breakthrough therapy designation and the EMA PRIME status will streamline the licensing of the world’s first vaccine for Ebola. The DTRA-funded V920 vaccine will then be available to protect warfighters and our allies from future Ebola endemics whether natural or weaponized.

KEEPING SCORE: Japan’s Nikkei 225 slumped 1.6 percent to 16,435.61 and South Korea’s Kospi fell 0.9 percent to 2,051.10. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index retreated 1.3 percent to 23,440.84. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 dropped 0.8 percent to 5,425.80. China’s Shanghai Composite Index was up 0.1 percent to 3,000.58. Stocks in Singapore and other Southeast Asian countries were also lower. ANALYST’S TAKE: “Risk sentiment waned overnight as worries about global banks weighed on markets,” said Alex Wijaya, senior sales trader at CMC Markets in Singapore. “Stock markets worldwide are rattled by the latest development at Deutsche Bank.” BANK WOES: U.S. authorities are seeking $14 billion from Deutsche Bank to settle legal claims over its sales of mortgage securities in 2007 and 2008, which helped kick off a global financial crisis. The bank said it had struck a deal to sell a subsidiary and stressed that it was not seeking government help but investors are worried what will happen to Germany’s biggest lender and to the broader financial system if Deutsche Bank runs low on capital. Analysts said the troubles at Deutsche Bank are raising scrutiny over other banks in Europe, which are also in talks regarding mortgage settlement with the U.S. authorities. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks finished lower on Thursday as drug companies and banks absorbed large losses. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 195.79 points, or 1.1 percent, to 18,143.45. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index sank 20.24 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,151.13. The Nasdaq composite dropped 49.39 points, or 0.9 percent, to 5,269.15. OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude lost 20 cents to $47.62 per barrel in New York. The contract gained 78 cents, or 1.7 percent, to close at $47.83 a barrel on Thursday. Oil prices surged earlier this week after the nations of OPEC, which collectively produce more than third of the world’s oil, agreed to a small cut in production in a surprise decision Brent crude, the international benchmark, fell 36 cents to $49.45 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 101.37 yen from 101.16 yen while the euro fell to $1.121 from $1.122.

Posted 29 Sep 2016 22:15 Updated 30 Sep 2016 04:40 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., September 28, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Wall Street dropped on Thursday, weighed down by Apple as well as selling in Wells Fargo, Citigroup and other major banks as investors worried about the health of Deutsche Bank. The S&P 500 financial index declined 1.49 percent after Bloomberg reported that some hedge funds have withdrawn excess cash and positions held at the German lender. Growing concerns over the stability of Germany's biggest bank have pushed its shares to record lows and its U.S.-listed stock on Thursday tumbled 6.7 percent. "This Deutsche Bank story is really casting a very long shadow over equity markets," said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group, in New York. "In some respects, it speaks to fears over large money-center banks having serious problems, and the last time we had that conversation was the financial crisis." Adding to negative sentiment in the banking sector, Wells Fargo & Co lost 2.07 percent after U.S. lawmakers rebuked CEO John Stumpf over his handling of sales abuses. Citigroup dropped 2.28 percent and JPMorgan Chase fell 1.59 percent. Apple fell 1.55 percent after Barclays cut its price target. The stock was the biggest drag on Wall Street. The S&P healthcare index lost 1.84 percent and also weighed heavily on the S&P 500 as shares of Merck and Johnson & Johnson declined. Among the gainers, Qualcomm jumped 6.3 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported the chipmaker is in talks to buy NXP Semiconductors. NXP surged 16.88 percent. Up 5 percent this year, the S&P 500 is trading near 16 times expected earnings, above its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. "Equity valuations are stretched and priced for perfection," said Mike Baele, managing director with the private client reserve group at U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. "I would not be surprised to see additional volatility." The CBOE Volatility Index, a gauge of near-term investor anxiety, jumped 14 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 1.07 percent to 18,143.45 points at the close, its sharpest decline since Sept 13. The S&P 500 lost 0.93 percent to end at 2,151.13 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.93 percent to 5,269.15. The S&P utilities index, which is sensitive to interest rates, fell 1.45 percent, its fifth day of losses in a row. Oil prices were up a day after OPEC members agreed to curb production, even as analysts raised questions about the effectiveness of the deal. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.87-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.09-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 35 new lows. About 7.7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the 7.0 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Drugmakers faced scrutiny over price increases, while banks fell as investors worried about the stability of Deutsche Bank and other financial institutions. Stocks were slightly lower in morning trading, and they fell hard at 12:30 p.m. Eastern time on renewed concerns about Germany's largest bank. EpiPen maker Mylan fell after legislators called for an investigation of the company. The price of oil continued to rise, which sent oil drilling and equipment companies higher. Stocks gave up most of their gains from the last two days. Quincy Krosby, market strategist for Prudential Financial, said investors don't trust Deutsche Bank's statements about its financial health and they are worried what will happen to the bank and to the broader financial system if Deutsche Bank runs low on capital. "The market begins to worry about Deutsche Bank and then the relationships Deutsche Bank has with other banks here in the United States," she said. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 195.79 points, or 1.1 percent, to 18,143.45. The Standard & Poor's 500 index sank 20.24 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,151.13. The Nasdaq composite dropped 49.39 points, or 0.9 percent, to 5,269.15. Mylan slumped after a group of senators asked the Department of Justice to investigate whether the drugmaker broke the law when it classified its emergency allergy shot EpiPen as a generic drug, which allowed Mylan to make lower rebate payments to states. Mylan gave up $1.75, or 4.4 percent, to $38.47. The stock is down 21 percent since mid-August as the company has come under criticism for repeatedly raising EpiPen's price over the last decade. Other drug companies traded lower as investors worry that the government will take action to rein in drug price increases. Merck fell $1.39, or 2.2 percent, to $61.91. Amgen fell $4.26, or 2.5 percent, to $165.45. Financial stocks slumped on renewed worries about Deutsche Bank. U.S. regulators are seeking $14 billion to settle legal claims over its sales of mortgage securities. It's also unclear whether the German government would support the bank if it runs low on capital. Deutsche Bank has said it isn't seeking government aid. Deutsche Bank's U.S.-listed shares have lost more than half their value this year. On Thursday they tumbled 82 cents, or 6.7 percent, to $11.48 in heavy trading. JPMorgan Chase slid $1.06, or 1.6 percent, to $65.65 and Goldman Sachs shed $4.50, or 2.8 percent, to $158.95. Oil prices continued to rise after a 5 percent surge the day before. Energy prices had jumped after the nations of OPEC, which collectively produce more than third of the world's oil, agreed to a small cut in production. The decision was a surprise, but something investors had long hoped for. The deal won't be finalized until November. U.S. crude picked up 78 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $47.83 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international benchmark, added 55 cents, or 1 percent, to $49.24 a barrel in London. Companies that drill for oil rose sharply as investors expected them to benefit from higher prices for crude. Devon Energy added $1.46, or 3.5 percent, to $43.04. Companies that provide rigs and other equipment to drillers also rose as investors expected that higher prices for crude will encourage more drilling. Helmerich & Payne rose $2.48, or 4 percent, to $65.26. Companies that refine oil fell on the prospect they will have to pay more money for the oil they refine. Marathon Petroleum fell $2.90, or 6.8 percent, to $39.74 and Valero Energy lost $3.40, or 6.2 percent, to $51.71. Who's hired?

The company has sold several brands to focus on product lines like Chef Boyardee and Hebrew National, and it's getting ready to split into two companies. ConAgra rose $3.12, or 7.2 percent, to $46.25. CBS and Viacom rose after Sumner Redstone's National Amusements, which controls both companies, said it wants them to combine again. CBS and Viacom had merged in 1999 and split up in 2006. Viacom, which recently replaced its CEO and then announced its interim CEO will leave in November, rose $1.21, or 3.3 percent, to $37.77 and CBS rose 42 cents to $54.57. Chipmakers Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors surged after the Wall Street Journal reported that Qualcomm is in talks to buy NXP. It said Qualcomm is considering other deals, but a purchase of NXP could be worth more than $30 billion. Bond prices moved higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.56 percent from 1.57 percent. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline fell 1 cent to $1.47 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2 cents to $1.51 a gallon. Natural gas shed 4 cents to $2.96 per 1,000 cubic feet. Germany's DAX lost 0.3 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 climbed 1 percent and the CAC 40 in France rose 0.3 percent.

KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 slumped 1.6 percent to 16,435.61 and South Korea's Kospi fell 0.9 percent to 2,051.10. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index retreated 1.3 percent to 23,440.84.

ANALYST'S TAKE: "Risk sentiment waned overnight as worries about global banks weighed on markets," said Alex Wijaya, senior sales trader at CMC Markets in Singapore. "Stock markets worldwide are rattled by the latest development at Deutsche Bank." BANK WOES: U.S. authorities are seeking $14 billion from Deutsche Bank to settle legal claims over its sales of mortgage securities in 2007 and 2008, which helped kick off a global financial crisis. The bank said it had struck a deal to sell a subsidiary and stressed that it was not seeking government help but investors are worried what will happen to Germany's biggest lender and to the broader financial system if Deutsche Bank runs low on capital. Analysts said the troubles at Deutsche Bank are raising scrutiny over other banks in Europe, which are also in talks regarding mortgage settlement with the U.S. authorities.

ET (Thursday), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 40.85 points, or 0.22%, at 18,298.39. The Reuters photo shows traders working on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. NEW YORK: Wall Street was lower in choppy trading late Thursday morning, pulled lower by Apple and healthcare stocks. The S&P healthcare index fell 0.7%, marking the second straight day of decline as shares of Merck and Johnson & Johnson booked losses. Apple fell 1.23% after Barclays cut its price target. The stock was the biggest drag on Wall Street. Investors are awaiting Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen’s speech in Washington for clues on the timing of the next interest rate hike. “The markets are taking a step back after a couple of pretty good days,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. “It is the end of the quarter so there are people messing around with some positions.” The three indexes have registered gains in the past two days. At 11:01am. ET (1501 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 40.85 points, or 0.22%, at 18,298.39. The S&P 500 was down 4.78 points, or 0.22%, at 2,166.59. The Nasdaq Composite was down 22.79 points, or 0.43%, at 5,295.75. Five of the 11 major S&P indexes were lower, with utilities  falling the most by 1.1%. The sector, which is sensitive to interest rates, is on track to mark its fifth day of losses in a row. Kansas City Fed President and voting member Esther George told CNBC that it was time to move ahead with a rate hike, a stand that Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart echoed. Oil prices were up 0.4%, after Wednesday’s 6% rally, as investors questioned whether an Opec agreement to curb production would be enough to rebalance a heavily over-supplied market. ConAgra was the top percentage gainer on the S&P, rising 7.3% after the company’s profit beat analysts’ estimate. Intra-Cellular plunged 63.2% after the company said its schizophrenia drug did not show any clinically significant difference when compared with placebo. Ebay rose 3% after Deutsche Bank upgraded the e-commerce platform’s rating to “buy” and raised its price target. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,667 to 1,156. On the Nasdaq, 1,625 issues fell and 995 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed 19 new 52-week highs and one new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 52 new highs and 20 new lows. - Reuters Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Stocks You May Be Interested ANZ's sale of insurance unit attracts Meiji Yasuda, AIA Group MTD ACPI wins RM679mil contract from MRT Corp Gas Malaysia’s outlook remains subdued Malaysia intervenes to help sagging ringgit: official China badminton star Lin Dan apologises for affair with model while wife was pregnant Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Some Turkish military officers at NATO seeking asylum - alliance chief Billionaire Widjaja family puts Singapore on the spot The Star's executive editor Soo Ewe Jin passes away Property Related advertisement Latest News Musa tables RM3.78bil surplus budget for Sabah SC appoints Gumuri as AOB executive chairman KLK posts offer document to MP Evans shareholders Malaysia’s Q3 net international investment improves to RM26.5bil MDEC and UOA Holdings to set up gaming hub Most Viewed in Business Ringgit continues slide Malaysia intervenes to help sagging ringgit: official Billionaire Widjaja family puts Singapore on the spot Ringgit opens lower against US dollar SC appoints Gumuri as AOB executive chairman MDEC and UOA Holdings to set up gaming hub Prince Alwaleed sees Saudi currency depeg as last resort KLK posts offer document to MP Evans shareholde Ringgit, KLCI continue to fall Market ends week lower advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Posted 29 Sep 2016 22:15 Updated 30 Sep 2016 04:40 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., September 28, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Wall Street dropped on Thursday, weighed down by Apple as well as selling in Wells Fargo, Citigroup and other major banks as investors worried about the health of Deutsche Bank. The S&P 500 financial index declined 1.49 percent after Bloomberg reported that some hedge funds have withdrawn excess cash and positions held at the German lender. Growing concerns over the stability of Germany's biggest bank have pushed its shares to record lows and its U.S.-listed stock on Thursday tumbled 6.7 percent. "This Deutsche Bank story is really casting a very long shadow over equity markets," said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group, in New York. "In some respects, it speaks to fears over large money-center banks having serious problems, and the last time we had that conversation was the financial crisis." Adding to negative sentiment in the banking sector, Wells Fargo & Co lost 2.07 percent after U.S. lawmakers rebuked CEO John Stumpf over his handling of sales abuses. Citigroup dropped 2.28 percent and JPMorgan Chase fell 1.59 percent. Apple fell 1.55 percent after Barclays cut its price target. The stock was the biggest drag on Wall Street. The S&P healthcare index lost 1.84 percent and also weighed heavily on the S&P 500 as shares of Merck and Johnson & Johnson declined. Among the gainers, Qualcomm jumped 6.3 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported the chipmaker is in talks to buy NXP Semiconductors. NXP surged 16.88 percent. Up 5 percent this year, the S&P 500 is trading near 16 times expected earnings, above its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. "Equity valuations are stretched and priced for perfection," said Mike Baele, managing director with the private client reserve group at U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. "I would not be surprised to see additional volatility." The CBOE Volatility Index, a gauge of near-term investor anxiety, jumped 14 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 1.07 percent to 18,143.45 points at the close, its sharpest decline since Sept 13. The S&P 500 lost 0.93 percent to end at 2,151.13 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.93 percent to 5,269.15. The S&P utilities index, which is sensitive to interest rates, fell 1.45 percent, its fifth day of losses in a row. Oil prices were up a day after OPEC members agreed to curb production, even as analysts raised questions about the effectiveness of the deal. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.87-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.09-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 35 new lows. About 7.7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the 7.0 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

The company will partner with Nektar Therapeutics on a combined clinical trial. Opdivo will be combined with Nektar’s experimental immune-stimulatory therapy to “improve on the current standard-of-care to treat melanoma and cancers of the kidney, colorectal system, bladder and the most common form of lung cancer,” reported Reuters. BMS’s drug is already approved for advanced melanoma and lung cancer, but it faces formidable competition from Merck’s Keytruda. A study published in August drew distinct parallels between both candidates’ prospects as the development process continued. Last month, BMS announced Opdivo didn’t meet its primary endpoint in a Phase 3 trial targeting first-line advanced non-small cell lung cancer, reported FierceBiotech. By contrast, Merck reported positive data regarding that indication for Keytruda in June. Here’s how this partnership with Nektar will work. Both companies will split the costs of the clinical trials evenly with oversight provided by a joint steering committee, according to another FierceBiotech report. Nektar will manage the trial while BMS has the right of first refusal if they decide to not proceed with commercialization. Each firm would also need to implement a new deal to advance Phase 3 development. The first part of this agreement will be a dose-escalation trial using Nektar’s candidate, which is expected to be completed during the first half of 2017.

Diane Harper, M.D., professor and chair of the department of Family and Geriatric Medicine at the University of Louisville, revealed at the 4th International Conference on Vaccination that HPV vaccines are essentially worthless, because rates of cervical cancer in the U.S. are extremely low anyway. Her speech was intended to promote the benefits of vaccines, but she changed her mind and went in a different direction in an effort to "clean her conscience about the deadly vaccines," according to The Daily Sheeple. Dr. Harper, a former vaccine research scientist for Merck, said she wouldn't be able to sleep at night unless she aired the truth about HPV vaccines. In her speech, given in Reston, Virginia, she said that 70 percent of all HPV infections resolve themselves without treatment, and 90 percent do so within two years. Over 40 young girls reported to have died from HPV vaccinesAll safety trials for HPV vaccines were done on 15-year-olds, said Dr. Harper, and not 9-year-olds, the demographic for which the immunizations are now recommended. Furthermore, there is a real risk associated with these vaccines, she added. More than 15,000 girls have experienced adverse side effects from Gardasil, according to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). A number likely to be far higher in reality, since many vaccine side effects go unreported. At least 44 girls are known to have died from these vaccines. Some side effects experienced by those receiving the HPV vaccines include seizures, blood clots, brain inflammation, lupus and Guillain Barre Syndrome, a rare but serious autoimmune deficiency that causes the immune system to attack and damage nerve cells. While the majority of those with GBS recover, the disorder may cause muscle weakness, difficulty breathing, paralysis and sometimes death. As with most vaccines, parents are usually not made aware of the risks. HPV vaccines work on only four of the 40 strains of the venereal disease "About eight in every ten women who have been sexually active will have HPV at some stage of their life," said Dr. Harper during her speech. "Normally there are no symptoms, and in 98 per cent of cases it clears itself. But in those cases where it doesn't, and isn't treated, it can lead to pre-cancerous cells which may develop into cervical cancer." Dr. Harper said that while Gardasil and Cervarix are marketed as protecting against cervical cancer, the claim has not been proven and is hypothetical. Research conducted on the drugs show "there is no demonstrated relationship between the condition being vaccinated for and the rare cancers that the vaccine might prevent, but it is marketed to do that nonetheless," she said. Former Merck scientist attacked for speaking out about HPV vaccine dangers "In fact, there is no actual evidence that the vaccine can prevent any cancer. From the manufacturers own admissions, the vaccine only works on 4 strains out of 40 for a specific venereal disease that dies on its own in a relatively short period, so the chance of it actually helping an individual is about the same as the chance of her being struck by a meteorite." Her comments though brave, placed Dr. Harper's reputation at risk. Big Pharma's attack dogs quickly sought to destroy her, attempting to dismantle her credibility as a professional research scientist. Since coming forward with her concerns about the HPV vaccines, a relentless and vicious campaign has been waged against her. The former Merck scientist was made to look like a kook in an article published by The Sunday Express, a British tabloid, which heavily misquoted her. Hoping to set the record straight, Dr. Harper clarified her position in an interview with CBS News, during which she said that HPV vaccines carry real risks while offering very little benefits. "The benefit to public health is nothing, there is no reduction in cervical cancers, they are just postponed, unless the protection lasts for at least 15 years, and over 70% of all sexually active females of all ages are vaccinated." She also added that reported side effects of the vaccine prove HPV vaccines are more dangerous than the cervical cancer its makers say it prevents.

Jason Payne / PNG Share Adjust Comment Print Vancouver’s Zymeworks has signed a licensing agreement with Japanese pharmaceutical giant Daiichi Sankyo to develop innovative cancer drugs. Daiichi Sankyo will gain access to Zymeworks’ drug development platforms in exchange for an undisclosed up-front payment and research support. The company will also be eligible to receive payments as drugs resulting from the research reach clinical and commercial milestones, as well as royalties on global product sales. Daiichi Sankyo is the second largest pharmaceutical company in Japan. Zymeworks has also inked recent deals with GlaxoSmith-Kline, Merck, Eli Lilly and Celgene.  Zymeworks‘ “bi-specific” antibodies can be fitted with proteins that recognize two markers on the same cell, reducing the chances that healthy cells will be destroyed, according to Ali Tehrani, Zymeworks’ president and CEO. Targeting two drivers of disease with a single … antibody is a key scientific advance Biologic therapies — drugs that activate the body’s immune system — are a huge leap forward from conventional chemotherapy treatments that kill cancer cells and healthy cells indiscriminately. Such antibodies can also be designed to identify and destroy two or more different kinds of cells, which gives the potential to treat so-called “mosaic tumours” that are made up of several different kinds of cancer cells, each with its own unique vulnerabilities. “Targeting two drivers of disease with a single monoclonal antibody is a key scientific advance that may help change the standard of care for patients with cancer,” said Antoine Yver, vice-president of oncology research and development for Daiichi Sankyo. Mosaic cancers are very challenging to treat, because conventional drugs that target one kind of cancer cell may leave others intact even in the same tumour. The ability to target two or more cell types at a time is expected to improve the efficacy of cancer medications. In addition, Zymeworks will license immuno-oncology antibodies from Daiichi Sankyo, with the right to research, develop and commercialize multiple bi-specific products globally. “The in-licensing component of the transaction will enable Zymeworks to expand its therapeutic pipeline in the near term by accelerating a number of our immuno-oncology programs into the clinic and to ultimately provide more effective and targeted treatments to patients,” said Tehrani. rshore@postmedia.com Auld Phillips: Fashion retailer thrives in small communities Investment Industry Association of Canada's Vancouver members hit by low commodity...

UK adults aged 70 and 78 years old will continue to be offered Zostavax(R) as part of their adult vaccination schedule. Supply of this new tender will start in 2017 for at least two years. "Sanofi Pasteur MSD is dedicated to raising awareness of shingles and the importance of senior vaccine programmes across Europe," said Andrea Rappagliosi, Vice President Market Access, Medical Affairs and Health Policy at Sanofi Pasteur MSD. "The renewal of the shingles immunisation programme for the UK is a demonstration of NHS England's commitment to healthy ageing for seniors and serves as a model for other countries in protecting against shingles," he added. Zostavax(R) is an efficient and well-tolerated, one-dose vaccine supported by over 10 years of real-life evidence. The vaccine has been used for the national immunisation programme since September 2013. By the end of March 2016 just under half of eligible adults in the UK had been vaccinated against shingles,[1] representing a significant achievement and opportunity to build upon for the upcoming season. "Shingles is a painful and disruptive disease which can lead to severe complications and accelerates decline in health in senior populations," said Robert W Johnson, MD.,FRCA., FFPMRCA., Hon. Senior Research Fellow, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Bristol, UK. "It's crucial that shingles vaccine coverage is as high as possible in the UK and across Europe to ensure the widest protection against the disease," he concluded.  UK disease coverage rates are an achievement but can be improved through ongoing efforts to identify and vaccinate all eligible individuals. A successful adult vaccination program relies on an effective vaccine that is easy to implement, ensuring it can be widely used in routine clinical practice. Zostavax(R) is licensed in the UK and across Europe for the immunisation of adults over 50 years and is given as a single injection[2] which supports vaccination adherence. Zostavax(R) has a well-established safety and tolerability profile from over 57,000 adults in clinical trials and over 32 million doses have been distributed worldwide since 2006, proving itself as an effective preventative measure available in a single dose with real-life experience in the primary care setting.[2],[3]   Several European countries have recently decided to recommend and/or fund Zostavax(R), including Austria, Greece, UK and France, as well as some regions in Germany, Italy and Spain. Shingles is a common and debilitating viral disease caused by the reactivation of the varicella zoster virus that can affect one in four people at some point in their lifetime. [4] Approximately 1.7 million new cases of shingles appear every year in Europe.[5],[6] The risk of developing shingles more than doubles after the age of 50 years, and 2/3 shingles cases occur after the age of 50 years.[7]-[9] The WHO predicts that the number of people aged 60 years and over worldwide will increase to 2 billion by 2050.[10] This growing senior population has a higher susceptibility to infectious diseases and associated complications that can be prevented through vaccination. # # # About Zostavax(R)  Zostavax(R) is a live attenuated vaccine that appropriately boosts immune control of the dormant shingles virus, with 10 years of routine use in primary care providing strong evidence of effectiveness and good safety. The vaccine is designed to appropriately boost the varicella-zoster virus specific cellular immunity, which controls virus reactivation and/or replication.[2] It is the first available preventative means licensed in Europe against shingles and the long lasting nerve pain that may follow the disease, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN).[2] More than 32 million doses of Zostavax(R) have been distributed worldwide since 2006.[3] About Sanofi Pasteur MSD - http://www.spmsd.com Sanofi Pasteur MSD is a European joint venture formed between Sanofi Pasteur (the vaccine division of Sanofi) and Merck (known as MSD outside the United States and Canada). Combining innovation and expertise, Sanofi Pasteur MSD is the only European pharmaceutical company dedicated exclusively to the distribution of vaccines. Sanofi Pasteur MSD makes use of the combined expertise resulting from Sanofi Pasteur and Merck's research to focus on the development of new vaccines in Europe in order to produce the most effective, most acceptable and better tolerated vaccines. * This announcement was made in the UK in July 2016 and, hence, this press release is not being released in the UK.

Continued Its Downfall Today Waiting for data is never easy. Brian Orelli (TMFBiologyFool) Sep 29, 2016 at 5:18PM Image source: Getty Images. What happened Exelixis (NASDAQ:EXEL) continued its fall today, down as much as 12% and ending the day down 8%, after falling 14% yesterday. So what? Today's move seems to be a continuation of yesterday. The momentum down shouldn't come as much of a surprise. Just look at the upward movement Exelixis' stock has experienced since the approval of its kidney cancer drug Cabometyx in April. EXEL data by YCharts. Despite the massive increase since approval, there hasn't been much data that changes Exelixis' valuation since the approval. In August, the biotech released sales numbers for the first nine weeks Cabometyx was on the market, but even that increase looks like a small blip on the above chart despite actually representing a one-day 18% increase in shares. Given investors' propensity to hit the buy button despite the lack of information on the expectation that Exelixis will be able to move into first-line kidney cancer patients, it shouldn't come as much of a surprise that investors are hitting the sell button at the first sign that the picture might not be as rosy as it could be. We already know that CABOSUN, a clinical trial testing Cabometyx against Pfizer's (NYSE:PFE) Sutent in first-line kidney cancer, showed that Cabometyx was superior to Sutent. But details of the trial, including by how much Cabometyx beat Pfizer's drug, have been kept under wraps prior to a scientific meeting: the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) meeting next month. The issue has become how much of that first-line indication Cabometyx can capture given the potential of the combination of Pfizer's Inlyta and Merck's Keytruda in kidney cancer, which appears to be working in the same setting, according to an ESMO abstract released yesterday. Of course, that data comes from an uncontrolled phase 1b trial, so it will remain unclear how the two treatments might work in a head-to-head competition even after Exelixis is given the opportunity to present the CABOSUN data at ESMO. Now what? Investors hate seeing shares of their companies go down for apparently little reason, but they never seem to mind it when shares increase for the same reason (or lack thereof). Long-term investors should strap in for the ride, because it could continue to be a bumpy between now and October 10, when the CABOSUN data is presented at ESMO.

Approximately 10 hedge funds were reducing their exposure in Deutsche Bank, according to a Bloomberg report. "The European banks took too long to recapitalize coming out of the crisis and you had the Eurozone crisis on top of it," said Troy Gayeski, partner and senior portfolio manager at SkyBridge Capital on Bloomberg. "What you're seeing now is the Eurozone banking issues hangs appall over all of Europe. We don't expect massive systemic risk like you had in 2008. But until the banking system cleans up its really hard to see European assets, particularly equities, getting a bit at all. Europe's been liquidated. Everyone knows what the story is. But why would investors come back until the Deutsche Bank issues are cleared up?" Deutsche Bank's price of shares sunk 6.67 percent to close at $11.48. Since peaking on July 31, 2015, shares of the Frankfurt-based company have fallen more than 65 percent. Overall, it was a bearish day on Wall Street after two consecutive days of gains. At one point, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) had dropped 248 points but would rally to finish down 195.79 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 18,143.45. The biggest decliners were Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which fell 2.75 percent, followed by Merck & Co. (MRK), which dropped 2.20 percent and Nike Inc. (NKE) which dipped 2.05 percent. Pfizer Inc. (PFE) dropped 1.97 percent as shares of health-care stocks dipped on worries of tighter regulations. Meanwhile, Apple Inc. (AAPL) fell 1.55 percent after Barclays cut its price target. Apple's shares have dipped 3.45 percent since reaching a high of $116.18 on Sept. 19. Join the Discussion Most Read Everything You Need To Know, Right Now.

Energy stocks led most markets higher on Thursday, Sept. 29, after OPEC nations reached a preliminary deal to cut oil production for the first time in eight years. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) SEOUL, South Korea - Global stock markets were sharply lower Friday as investor sentiment was dented by renewed worries about the financial health of Deutsche Bank following reports that some hedge funds were moving their businesses out of Germany's biggest bank. KEEPING SCORE: European stocks started lower. Britain's FTSE 100 fell 1.1 per cent to 6,847.05 while France's CAC 40 sank 1.7 per cent to 4,366.89. Germany's DAX lost 1.6 per cent to 10,243.71. Futures augured a tepid start on Wall Street. S&P futures and Dow futures both lost 0.2 per cent. ANALYST'S TAKE: "Risk sentiment waned overnight as worries about global banks weighed on markets," said Alex Wijaya, senior sales trader at CMC Markets in Singapore. "Stock markets worldwide are rattled by the latest development at Deutsche Bank." BANK WOES: Shares of Deutsche Bank nosedived to below 10 euros a share for the first time after reports said some hedge funds have taken measures to reduce risks associated with the German bank. The company has been a source of concerns for investors for weeks since U.S. authorities disclosed that they are seeking $14 billion from the bank to settle legal claims over its sales of mortgage securities in 2007 and 2008. The bank said it had struck a deal to sell a subsidiary and stressed that it was not seeking government help, but investors are worried about what will happen to Germany's biggest lender and to the broader financial system if Deutsche Bank runs low on capital. Analysts said the bank's troubles are raising scrutiny over other banks in Europe, which are also in talks regarding mortgage settlements with U.S. authorities. CHINA OUTPUT: The Caixin monthly purchasing managers' index, which is closely watched for insights into China's economy, ticked up to 50.1 for September from the previous month's 50.0 reading. The tiny expansion in activity and gains in overall new orders for the third straight month offered a glimmer of hope for the world's second-largest economy that has been grappling with a prolonged slowdown. But the private survey result was not strong enough to relieve investors outside China. ASIA'S DAY: Japan's Nikkei 225 slumped 1.5 per cent to 16,449.84 and South Korea's Kospi fell 1.2 per cent to 2,043.63. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index sank 1.9 per cent to 23,297.15. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 dropped 0.7 per cent to 5,435.90. China's Shanghai Composite Index was up 0.2 per cent to 3,004.70. Stocks in Singapore and other Southeast Asian countries were lower. OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude lost 54 cents to $47.29 per barrel in New York. The contract gained 78 cents, or 1.7 per cent, to close at $47.83 a barrel on Thursday. Oil prices surged earlier this week after the nations of OPEC, which collectively produce more than third of the world's oil, agreed to a small cut in production in a surprise decision. Brent crude, the international benchmark, fell 61 cents to $49.20 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar fell to 101.03 yen from 101.16 yen while the euro weakened to $1.118 from $1.122.       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *       FILE - In this Monday, Sept. 26, 2016, file photo, trader James Dresch, center, works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.

In addition, increasing demand of anti-cancer drugs for the treatment of ageing population, rising government funds and improved treatment results, are major factors boosting the market growth. However, the high cost involved in new drug development, coupled with threat of failure and adverse effects associated with anti-cancer drugs therapies, would restrain the growth of the LAMEA market. Moreover, accessibility of anti-cancer drugs incurred by high cost, is a major challenge that is expected to further impede the performance of anti-cancer drugs in LAMEA region. Nevertheless, commercialization of advanced therapeutics, such as targeted therapies and immunotherapies (biologic therapies) would reduce the negative influence of restraints and fuel the market growth.

Further, the biological therapy is the fastest growing segment at a CAGR of 12.2%, throughout the analysis period, on account of high efficacy and target specific action. Moreover, blood cancer drugs market was the largest revenue generating application segment in 2015, owing to the high cost of drugs (immunotherapies), used for the treatment of blood cancer. Based on countries the LAMEA region is segmented into nine countries named Brazil, Argentina, Nigeria, South Africa, Iraq, Iran, Algeria, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Brazil dominates the LAMEA market closely followed by Argentina, owing to rising incidence of cancer, high expenditure and gross national income (GNI) of Brazil specifically. In addition, LAMEA market is poised to grow at a promising CAGR of 8.6% during the forecast period.

Menendez Vote Reflects Support of Corporate Political Spending Disclosure Print Email Jonathan D. Salant | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com By Jonathan D. Salant | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 29, 2016 at 6:50 AM, updated September 29, 2016 at 6:05 PM comments WASHINGTON— A growing number of public companies are voluntarily disclosing their corporate donations to trade associations and other nonprofits, and U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez wants to require all of them to reveal their political spending. Such New Jersey companies as Becton, Dickinson & Co. of Frankin Lakes and Prudential Financial of Newark were among the most transparent, according to a report issued Thursday by the Center for Political Accountability and the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School's Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research. On the other side, the Parsippany-based animal health company Zoetis and the retailer Bed, Bath & Beyond, based in Union, were among the worst in terms of disclosure, according to the report. "You have a responsibility to your investors to tell them what you do and what you don't do," center president Bruce Freed said. "You see the improvements from year to year. That is very important."  N.J. senators: Require spending disclosure While political action committee donations already must be reported, the Washington-based Center for Political Accountability is pushing companies to also disclose what they've spent from the corporate treasury, such as dues to trade groups or contributions to nonprofits that spend money on political advertising. Of 493 companies listed in the Standard & Poor's index, 224 report their donations to trade groups or prohibit such contributions, up from 204 a year ago; and 153 disclose donations to nonprofits or ban those, an increase from 125 in 2015. Voluntary disclosure has become more important as the amount of secret money pouring into campaigns continues to grow in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision. Money spent by groups that keep their donors secret tripled to $300 million in 2012 from $100 million in 2008, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based research group. The Securities and Exchange Commission is considering requiring public companies to disclose their political spending, but the spending bill keeping the federal government open through Dec. 9 includes a Senate Republican-authored provision blocking the agency from moving ahead. Menendez on Wednesday voted against the spending bill, citing the anti-disclosure provision. U.S. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) also voted no. Congress will have to fun the government after Dec. 9, and Menendez said he will fight to keep the provision out of that spending bill. A member of the Senate Banking Committee, Menendez has introduced legislation prohibiting companies from making political expenditures from their corporate treasuries unless a majority of shareholders approve, and has pushed the SEC to issue its own disclosure rule. "It is important to shareholders and investors to know how their money is being spent," Menendez said in an interview. "It casts a bright light on dark money. It would ultimately have a chilling effect on the use of corporate money in elections if companies had to disclose what they were spending and who they were spending it on." Indeed, corporations have run into trouble with their political spending. Target Corp. faced a boycott by gay-rights groups in 2010 after donating $150,000 to a business group backing a gubernatorial candidate in Minnesota who opposed same-sex marriage. And while the Merck & Co. and Comcast Corp. PACs backed Booker's run for Senate, they also contributed to trade associations that helped fund a nonprofit group spending money to defeat him. The report also singled out Public Service Enterprise Group, based in Newark, for its increased disclosure. Spokeswoman Kate Vossen said the company last year began disclosing its corporate spending "in an effort to continuously improve our transparency." "Prudential recognizes the importance of participation in the American democratic process," spokeswoman Laura Burke said. "Our culture of strong governance drives our commitment to transparency in all disclosures.  We are pleased to be recognized for our commitment to transparency in this recent report."  Becton and Bed, Bath and Beyond did not respond to a request for comment. Zoetis was at the bottom of the index with a score of zero, meaning the company did not undertake any steps to disclose corporate political spending. "Zoetis is committed to good corporate governance practices and transparency, and we make all the required federal and state disclosures for political activities," said Bill Price, a vice president.

Shortly after the conference, the presentation will be available on the Ablynx website under the R&D portfolio section (http://www.ablynx.com/rd-portfolio/clinical-programmes/caplacizumab/). Acquired TTP is an acute, ultra-rare, life-threatening blood clotting disorder in which uncontrolled platelet aggregation and microclot formation cause small blood vessel occlusions throughout the body[1] (#_ftn1), resulting in thrombotic complications and widespread organ damage[2] (#_ftn2). Despite the current standard-of-care treatment of daily plasma exchange (PEX) and immunosuppression, episodes of aTTP are still associated with a mortality rate of up to 20%, with most deaths occurring within 30 days of diagnosis[3] (#_ftn3). Furthermore, patients are at risk of acute thromboembolic complications (e.g. stroke, venous thrombosis and myocardial infarction) and of recurrence of disease. In addition, some patients are refractory to therapy[4] (#_ftn4), which is associated with a very poor prognosis for survival of an acute episode of aTTP. Data from the French Reference Center for Thrombotic Microangiopathies showed that 50% of patients who died from an acute episode were refractory to treatment[5] (#_ftn5). Post-hoc analyses of the Phase II TITAN study data were performed to assess the impact of caplacizumab on a composite endpoint of major thromboembolic complications and aTTP-related mortality, as well as on refractoriness to standard treatment. The results demonstrate that a clinically meaningful lower proportion of subjects treated with caplacizumab experienced one or more major thromboembolic events, or died, as compared to placebo (11.4% versus 43.2%). In addition, fewer caplacizumab-treated patients, compared to those who received placebo, were refractory[6] (#_ftn6) to treatment (5.7% versus 21.6%; and 0% versus 10.8%, respectively depending on the definition of refractoriness4). There were two deaths in the placebo group and both those patients were refractory to treatment; no deaths were reported in the caplacizumab group. A Phase III confirmatory study of caplacizumab is currently ongoing which includes prospectively defined assessments of these clinically relevant endpoints. Professor Flora Peyvandi, Principal Investigator for the TITAN study at IRCCS Maggiore Hospital Foundation, University of Milan, Italy, commented: "Acquired TTP is a very severe disease with high unmet medical need. Any new treatment option would need to act fast to immediately inhibit the formation of micro-clots in order to protect the patient during the acute phase of the disease and so have the potential to avoid the resulting complications. The topline results and the subsequent post-hoc analyses of the Phase II TITAN data demonstrate that caplacizumab has the potential to reduce the major morbidity and mortality associated with acquired TTP, and confirm our conviction that it should become an important pillar in the management of acquired TTP." About caplacizumab Caplacizumab is a highly potent and selective bivalent anti-von Willebrand Factor (vWF) Nanobody that received Orphan Drug Designation in the United States and Europe in 2009. Caplacizumab blocks the interaction of ultra-large vWF multimers (ULvWF) with platelets and, therefore, has an immediate effect on platelet aggregation and the ensuing formation and accumulation of the microclots that cause the severe thrombocytopenia and organ and tissue damage in aTTP. This immediate effect protects the patient from the manifestations of the disease while the underlying disease process resolves. The efficacy and safety of caplacizumab in conjunction with the standard of care (PEX) were evaluated in the Phase II TITAN study in 75 patients with aTTP. Caplacizumab was well-tolerated and the primary endpoint of reduction in time to platelet normalisation was met (p=0.005). Treatment with caplacizumab resulted in a nearly 40% reduction in time to platelet count normalisation as compared to placebo (i.e., a faster reversion of thrombocytopenia with consequent reduced use of PEX). Moreover, during treatment, caplacizumab reduced aTTP recurrences by 71% compared to placebo when administered as an adjunct to standard of care[7] (#_ftn7).  These Phase II results will serve as the basis for filing for conditional approval of caplacizumab in Europe in early 2017. The confirmatory Phase III HERCULES study is currently ongoing and will support the BLA filing in the United States. Results from this Phase III study are expected by the end of 2017. Caplacizumab has the potential to be the first therapeutic specifically approved for the treatment of acquired TTP. About aTTP aTTP is an acute, ultra-rare, life-threatening, blood clotting disorder, affecting up to 11 per million people worldwide. It has a sudden onset caused by impaired activity of the ADAMTS13 enzyme (typically <10% of that in normal plasma), leaving ULvWF molecules uncleaved (vWF is an important protein involved in the blood clotting process). These ULvWF molecules spontaneously bind to blood platelets, resulting in severe thrombocytopenia (very low platelet count) and micro-clot formation in small blood vessels throughout the body, leading to thrombotic complications and widespread organ damage. Up to 20% of patients die from an initial aTTP episode with most deaths occurring within 30 days of diagnosis. In addition to the acute risks of the disease, patients experiencing an episode of aTTP may suffer long-term consequences such as cognitive deficits, depression, and arterial hypertension[8] (#_ftn8), and are at risk for recurrence. The recurrence rate ranges from 10-84%[9] (#_ftn9) and typically occur within 1-2 years[10] (#_ftn10), but recurrences have been reported up to 30 years after the initial episode[11] (#_ftn11).

ALNY, +1.51% the leading RNAi therapeutics company, announced today initial data from its ongoing Phase 1/2 study with ALN-GO1, an investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting glycolate oxidase (GO) for the treatment of Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1 (PH1). Initial clinical results were presented today during an oral presentation at the 17th Congress of the International Pediatric Nephrology Association (IPNA), being held September 20 – 24, 2016 in Iguaçu, Brazil. These data were from Part A of the ongoing Phase 1/2 study, which is being conducted in healthy adult volunteers. Results showed that single, subcutaneous doses of ALN-GO1 achieved dose-dependent increases in plasma and urine glycolate. Glycolate is the substrate used by the GO enzyme to produce excessive oxalate in patients with PH1; thus, increases in plasma and urine glycolate in normal volunteers confirm effective GO knockdown and provide preliminary human proof of concept for ALN-GO1. Further, ALN-GO1 was found to be generally well tolerated, with no serious adverse events (SAEs) reported through the safety data transfer date. The Company plans to soon transition to Part B of the Phase 1/2 study, which will evaluate multiple doses of ALN-GO1 in patients with PH1. “We believe ALN-GO1 has the potential to be a transformative therapy for patients with PH1, a potentially fatal and ultra-rare orphan disease that primarily afflicts children. The current treatment approach for patients suffering from this condition is routine dialysis and, ultimately, a dual liver and kidney transplant, as no approved pharmaceutical options currently exist,” said Akshay Vaishnaw, M.D., Ph.D., Executive Vice President of R&D and Chief Medical Officer at Alnylam. “We believe these initial results are encouraging, as they demonstrate preliminary human proof of concept for this novel investigational RNAi therapeutic. We now look forward to advancing this program into patients in Part B of the ongoing Phase 1/2 study, where we aim to achieve lowering of urinary oxalate, which is known to deposit in kidneys and cause extensive renal and broader tissue damage in patients with PH1.” Initial results include all available data as of the data transfer dates on August 17, 2016 (for safety) and September 2, 2016 (for pharmacodynamic activity). Subjects in Part A (N=32) were enrolled in four single ascending dose cohorts (N=8 per group, randomized 3:1 drug:placebo), with subjects receiving ALN-GO1 at doses ranging from 0.3 to 6.0 mg/kg. ALN-GO1 administration resulted in dose-dependent and statistically significant (nominal two-sided p values less than 0.05) increases from baseline in plasma and urinary glycolate as compared to placebo, with up to an 8-fold increase in plasma glycolate in the highest dose cohort. Based on extrapolation from pre-clinical studies, the observed level of glycolate increase would correlate with an estimated greater than 80% silencing of the HAO1 mRNA, the transcript of the GO enzyme. The effects of ALN-GO1 were highly durable, with levels sustained through 85 days at the highest dose, supportive of a once-monthly and possibly once-quarterly subcutaneous dose regimen. Single doses of ALN-GO1 were shown to be generally well tolerated in healthy adult volunteers. There were no SAEs reported. Adverse events (AEs) were reported in 88% (N=21) of ALN-GO1 treated subjects and 63% (N=5) of placebo treated subjects. Common AEs occurring in greater than 10% of ALN-GO1 treated subjects included nasopharyngitis (N=6), headache (N=5), and transient injection site pain (N=4). All AEs were mild to moderate with the exception of one subject in the lowest dose cohort who had transient, asymptomatic CPK elevation which was unrelated to study drug.

ALN-GO1 RNAi Roundtable Webinar Information Alnylam will review these initial clinical data and discuss PH1 and plans for the further development of ALN-GO1 in an RNAi Roundtable webinar this Tuesday, September 27, 2016 at 10:00 a.m. ET. Speakers include: Barry Greene, President David Erbe, Ph.D., Director, Research Guest Speaker: Sally-Anne Hulton, M.D., FRCPCH, MRCP, FCP, MBBCh, Consultant Paediatric Nephrologist and Clinical Lead, Birmingham Children’s Hospital NHS Trust Guest Speaker: Jennifer Lawrence, M.D. (mother of a PH1 patient) To register for the webinar, please visit www.alnylam.com/roundtables. A replay of the webinar and downloadable PDF of the presentation will be available on that website shortly after the Roundtable. About the ALN-GO1 Phase 1/2 Study The Phase 1/2 trial of ALN-GO1 is a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study being conducted in two parts. Part A is a single-dose study that enrolled 32 healthy adult volunteers. Part B will be a multi-dose study designed to enroll up to a total of 20 patients with PH1. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate safety and tolerability of single and multiple subcutaneous doses of ALN-GO1. Secondary objectives include evaluation of pharmacokinetics and clinical activity for ALN-GO1 as measured by its effects on plasma glycolate and urinary oxalate levels in normal healthy volunteers and PH1 patients, respectively. About Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1 (PH1) and ALN-GO1 PH1 is an inborn error of metabolism. Specifically, PH1 is an autosomal recessive disorder of glyoxylate metabolism, where hepatic detoxification of glyoxylate is impaired due to mutation of the AGXT gene – which encodes the liver peroxisomal alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT) enzyme – resulting in excessive oxalate production. Excess oxalate in PH1 patients results in the deposition of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys and urinary tract and can lead to the formation of recurrent kidney stones or nephrocalcinosis. Renal damage is caused by a combination of tubular toxicity from oxalate, calcium oxalate deposition in the kidneys, and urinary obstruction by calcium oxalate stones. Compromised kidney function exacerbates the disease as the excess oxalate can no longer be excreted, potentially resulting in subsequent accumulation and crystallization in bones, eyes, skin, and heart, leading to severe illness and death. About 50 percent of patients will have kidney failure by age 15, and about 80 percent will have end stage renal disease by age 30. Current treatment options are very limited, and include frequent renal dialysis or combined organ transplantation of liver and kidneys, a procedure with high morbidity that is limited due to organ availability. Although a small minority of patients respond to Vitamin B6 supplementation, there are no approved pharmaceutical therapies for PH1. ALN-GO1 is an investigational RNAi therapeutic, currently in early stage clinical development. The safety and efficacy of ALN-GO1 have not been evaluated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or any other health authority. Sanofi Genzyme Alliance In January 2014, Alnylam and Sanofi Genzyme, the specialty care global business unit of Sanofi, formed an alliance to accelerate and expand the development and commercialization of RNAi therapeutics across the world. The alliance is structured as a multi-product geographic alliance in the field of rare diseases. Alnylam retains product rights in North America and Western Europe, while Sanofi Genzyme obtained the right to access certain programs in Alnylam's current and future Genetic Medicines pipeline, including ALN-GO1, in the rest of the world (ROW) through the end of 2019, together with certain broader co-development/co-commercialization rights and global product rights for certain products, including ALN-GO1. About GalNAc Conjugates and Enhanced Stabilization Chemistry (ESC)-GalNAc Conjugates GalNAc-siRNA conjugates are a proprietary Alnylam delivery platform and are designed to achieve targeted delivery of RNAi therapeutics to hepatocytes through uptake by the asialoglycoprotein receptor. Alnylam's Enhanced Stabilization Chemistry (ESC)-GalNAc-conjugate technology enables subcutaneous dosing with increased potency and durability, and a wide therapeutic index. This delivery platform is being employed in nearly all of Alnylam's pipeline programs, including programs in clinical development. About RNAi RNAi (RNA interference) is a revolution in biology, representing a breakthrough in understanding how genes are turned on and off in cells, and a completely new approach to drug discovery and development. Its discovery has been heralded as "a major scientific breakthrough that happens once every decade or so," and represents one of the most promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug discovery today which was awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. RNAi is a natural process of gene silencing that occurs in organisms ranging from plants to mammals. By harnessing the natural biological process of RNAi occurring in our cells, the creation of a major new class of medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics, is on the horizon. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate RNAi and comprise Alnylam's RNAi therapeutic platform, target the cause of diseases by potently silencing specific mRNAs, thereby preventing disease-causing proteins from being made. RNAi therapeutics have the potential to treat disease and help patients in a fundamentally new way. About Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Alnylam is a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics based on RNA interference, or RNAi. The company is leading the translation of RNAi as a new class of innovative medicines. Alnylam's pipeline of investigational RNAi therapeutics is focused in 3 Strategic Therapeutic Areas (STArs): Genetic Medicines, with a broad pipeline of RNAi therapeutics for the treatment of rare diseases; Cardio-Metabolic Disease, with a pipeline of RNAi therapeutics toward genetically validated, liver-expressed disease targets for unmet needs in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; and Hepatic Infectious Disease, with a pipeline of RNAi therapeutics that address the major global health challenges of hepatic infectious diseases. In early 2015, Alnylam launched its "Alnylam 2020" guidance for the advancement and commercialization of RNAi therapeutics as a whole new class of innovative medicines. Specifically, by the end of 2020, Alnylam expects to achieve a company profile with 3 marketed products, 10 RNAi therapeutic clinical programs – including 4 in late stages of development – across its 3 STArs. The company's demonstrated commitment to RNAi therapeutics has enabled it to form major alliances with leading companies including Ionis, Novartis, Roche, Takeda, Merck, Monsanto, The Medicines Company, and Sanofi Genzyme. In addition, Alnylam holds an equity position in Regulus Therapeutics Inc., a company focused on discovery, development, and commercialization of microRNA therapeutics. Alnylam scientists and collaborators have published their research on RNAi therapeutics in over 200 peer-reviewed papers, including many in the world's top scientific journals such as Nature, Nature Medicine, Nature Biotechnology, Cell, New England Journal of Medicine, and The Lancet. Founded in 2002, Alnylam maintains headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. For more information about Alnylam's pipeline of investigational RNAi therapeutics, please visit www.alnylam.com.

Senators Ask DOJ To Investigate Mylan Over Possible EpiPen Medicaid Fraud Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Senators Ask DOJ To Investigate Mylan Over Possible EpiPen Medicaid Fraud Image courtesy of Phillip Bradshaw September 28, 2016 12:27 pm EST By Chris Morran@themorrancave gaming the system epipen Mylan doj drugs drug prices EpiPen maker Mylan might have thought that dealing with the public shaming of a congressional hearing would be the low point of its ongoing price-hike scandal, but lawmakers continue to scrutinize the drug company and are now calling for a federal investigation into the possibility that Mylan was deliberately mis-categorizing the emergency allergy medication in order to reap bigger payments from Medicaid. In a letter [PDF] sent this morning to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch by Senators Richard Blumenthal (CT), Chuck Grassley (IA), and Amy Klobuchar (MN), the lawmakers question the way that EpiPen was categorized under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. That program requires drugmakers to pay a portion of their revenues — in the form of rebates — to the states. The size of those rebates is determined by whether the drug is considered an “innovator” medication (often a newer, higher-cost drug with little or no competition) or a “non-innovator multiple source” (NIMS) drug (often an older drug with competition from generics). More precisely, the Social Security Act defines a NIMS drug as a covered medication for which there is “at least 1 other drug product which is rated as therapeutically equivalent… and is sold or marketed in the United States during the period.” The difference between a NIMS drug and an innovator drug could have a big impact on a company’s bottom line. A drugmaker only pays a rebate worth 13% of the price for a NIMS drug, but innovator medications have rebate rates that start at 23.1%. Drug companies are on a sort of honor code to categorize each of their drugs accordingly, and they can face significant penalties for labeling a drug as NIMS just to pay the lower rebate. In fact, back in 2009 Mylan was one of four drugmakers that paid a penalty to the DOJ totaling $124 million for allegedly trying to game the rebate program. Mylan has classified EpiPen as a NIMS medication since it acquired the drug, along with the rest of Merck’s generics business, nearly a decade ago. And it appears that this classification of the emergency allergy treatment goes back to at least 1997, when the Department of Health and Human Services concluded that EpiPen — at the time — qualified as a multiple-source drug. “However, the EpiPen marketed by Mylan is significantly different than the 1997 version,” write the senators, pointing to new patents that have protected EpiPen from competition, along with other changes to the product. “Further, it is our understanding that classifying the EpiPen as a non-innovator product is inconsistent with industry practice. When Mylan’s competitors market a drug delivery product under a new drug application, at least some of them classify the product as an innovator, even if the drug being delivered is off-patent.” The letter argues that EpiPen, which controls nearly all of the U.S. market for epinephrine auto-injectors, currently has no FDA-approved therapeutic equivalent and Mylan may be smaller rebates than the law requires. Deliberately misleading the government into the lower rebate rate could be a violation of the False Claims Act, notes the letter, which asks the DOJ to investigate accordingly. “The American people have been rightly outraged as Mylan engaged in substantial price increases that resulted in billions of dollars paid by U.S. consumers,” concludes the letter. “They deserve to know whether the company also violated the False Claims Act and diverted millions of dollars from U.S. taxpayers.” Earlier this month, Inside Health Policy reported that the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) had notified Mylan that the EpiPen was indeed incorrectly categorized as NIMS. West Virginia’s attorney general recently revealed that he is already investigating Mylan’s possible deliberate misclassification of EpiPen, along with concerns that the company may have violated antitrust laws by making a deal with Teva Pharmaceuticals to keep an EpiPen competitor off the market while the sticker price of the drug soared by around 600%.

recognize leadership in improving health News provided by National Alliance of Healthcare Purchaser Coalitions (National Alliance) Sep 29, 2016, 12:23 ET Share this article WASHINGTON, Sept. 29, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The Allegheny County Schools Health Insurance Consortium was presented with the Employer Excellence Award and the Memphis Business Group on Health received the Member Leadership Award at the National Alliance of Healthcare Purchaser Coalitions* (National Alliance) annual conference. The recipients were recognized for their efforts to improve the quality and efficiency of the healthcare delivery system and health of employees and communities. (*Formerly the National Business Coalition on Health) Employer Excellence Award The Allegheny County Schools Health Insurance Consortium (ACSHIC), a public employer representing approximately 43,000 lives, was recognized for its efforts to develop a narrow, high quality network. To make this decision, ACSHIC trustees used tools and resources through the Pittsburgh Business Group on Health (of which they are a member) to analyze the cost and quality and overall value of providers and services. The result was working with the organization's health plan carrier to design a tiered benefit plan design that offered a narrow, high quality network, which saved the taxpayers more than $10 million in claims over the first half of 2015 alone. This change enabled ACSHIC to eliminate deductibles and copays for its members, bucking the trend towards high deductible plans while they reduced costs. "We applaud the efforts of ACSHIC to achieve higher quality healthcare while lowering costs," said Jessica Brooks, CEO/Executive Director for the Pittsburgh Business Group on Health. "Their focus helped drive physically and financially healthier schools, and contain costs for the taxpayers and community." Member Leadership Award The Memphis Business Group on Health, under the leadership of CEO Cristie Upshaw Travis, has long played a critical role in encouraging and assisting Memphis-area employers to not only create a culture of health within their organizations, but to implement programs that will more broadly help the entire community. The coalition works with Tennessee hospitals, physicians, health plans, community and government leaders to drive healthcare delivery system reform. MBGH sponsors the CEO Culture of Health initiative with 64 organizations in the Memphis-area currently participating and was a founding member of the Common Table Health Alliance (formerly Healthy Memphis Common Table) as well as Healthy Shelby. National efforts include Travis serving on the Health Alliance board; as a board member and Regional Roll-out Leader for The Leapfrog Group, a hospital patient-safety organization; and co-chair of committees of the National Quality Forum, the multi-stakeholder, consensus-building organization that leads national collaboration to improve health and healthcare quality through measurement. "Memphis Business Group on Health is a proud member of the National Alliance, learning from our sister coalitions and helping where we can to share our experience and expertise to assist purchasers nationally," said Travis. "We are honored to be recognized for our 31 years of work to create, support and sustain a culture of health at the workplace for our members and their families." The National Alliance's Member Leadership Award is sponsored by Merck. About the National Alliance of Healthcare Purchaser Coalitions The National Alliance is a nonprofit network of business health coalitions, representing more than 12,000 purchasers and 41 million Americans. Its members are dedicated to driving innovation, health and value through the collective action of public and private purchasers. The organization seeks to accelerate the nation's progress toward safe, efficient, high-quality health care and the improved health status of the American population. www.nationalalliancehealth.org Logo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160926/411956LOGO   To view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/allegheny-county-schools-health-insurance-consortium-and-memphis-business-group-on-health-honored-by-national-alliance-at-annual-conference-300336622.html SOURCE National Alliance of Healthcare Purchaser Coalitions (National Alliance) Related Links http://www.nationalalliancehealth.org My News Release contains wide tables.

Note that the exact reason why azithromycin would have such a beneficial impact in women undergoing cesarean delivery is unknown, although broad spectrum antibiotics could potentially be more effective than cefazolin against existing pathogens in the vaginal microbiome. Women given azithromycin on top of standard antibiotic prophylaxis during cesarean delivery had a lower rate of post-delivery infections than women who received placebo plus standard prophylaxis in a randomized trial. Compared with women receiving cefazolin (the standard antibiotic prophylaxis prior to cesarean section) plus placebo, women who received cefazolin plus azithromycin were linked with significantly lower rates of endometritis, wound infection, and other infections, reported Alan T.N. Tita, MD, of University of Alabama at Birmingham, and colleagues. The full results of this study, which were partially presented earlier this year at the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine annual meeting, were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Uma Reddy, MD, of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, which funded the research, characterized this as "strong evidence" on the important topic of decreasing maternal mortality. "The rate of maternal death in the U.S. has increased, so research that focuses on how to decrease serious complications like this are still very much needed," she told MedPage Today. "Any intervention that can decrease complication from c-sections will have major impact on pregnancy outcomes and the health of women." Better Outcomes with Broad Spectrum Co-author William Andrews, MD, also of University of Alabama at Birmingham, told MedPage Today that earlier research indicated the potential benefit of an expanded antibiotic approach, but it included smaller studies that involved a more complex regimen of three antibiotics. An accompanying editorial by Robert A. Weinstein, MD, and Kenneth M. Boyer, MD, both of Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, theorized on why administering azithromycin would have such a beneficial impact in women undergoing cesarean delivery. Both the authors and editorialists noted that broad spectrum antibiotics could potentially be more effective against existing pathogens in the vaginal microbiome that increase the risk of infection, which cefazolin lacks the ability to do. "We focused on azithromycin because it covers Ureaplasma organisms, which are more commonly associated with infections after cesarean section than anaerobes when specific cultures are performed and because it has been associated with reduced risks of both wound infections and endometritis," Tita and colleagues wrote. But Weinstein and Boyer also argued that another reason why the additional antibiotic may have worked was that cefazolin could have been underdosed in this population -- three-quarters of which had a BMI of over 30. "Azithromycin [may have] improved outcomes on the basis of the additive effects of the two drugs against common surgical pathogens, such as staphylococcus species," the editorialists argued. The C/SOAP trial randomized 2,013 women with a singleton pregnancy and a gestational age of 24 weeks or more to the two treatment arms. A significant difference in the rate of postoperative complications within 6 weeks (a composite of endometritis, wound infection and other infections) was observed in the azithromycin group compared with placebo (6.1% versus 12.0%, respectively, P<0.001). While there were significant differences in the rate of serious maternal adverse events between the two groups (1.5% for azithromycin group versus 2.9% for placebo, P=0.03), there were no differences in secondary neonatal outcomes (a composite of neonatal death and serious neonatal complications) between the two groups (14.3% vs 13.6%, respectively, P=0.63). Time for a Guideline Change? Andrews characterized this course of treatment as a "simple approach," noting that azithromycin is relatively inexpensive and readily available antibiotic. "These infections are associated with considerable expense, discomfort, occasionally even maternal death," he told MedPage Today. "Thus, I believe that ob/gyn's should consider adopting this expanded-spectrum antibiotic coverage based on the results of this study." Current guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists currently lack a specific recommendation for this particular antibiotic for use in cesarean delivery, but Reddy said that she hoped that might change, given the results of this study. "It will be up to professional societies, such as ACOG, to come up with guidance, but this research provides important evidence that this antibiotic may decrease infection-related complications by half," she argued. However, Weinstein and Boyer were cautious in interpreting these results. They noted that this particular group of higher-risk patients may have been more likely to benefit from azithromycin, and that higher doses of cefazolin could be evaluated prior to adding an additional antibiotic. The editorialists also suggested additional research about the potential impact of an additional antibiotic on the maternal and infant microbiome. This study was supported in part by a grant from the NICHD. The azithromycin used in the study was provided by Pfizer through an investigator-initiated grant.

UK adults aged 70 and 78 years old will continue to be offered Zostavax® as part of their adult vaccination schedule. Supply of this new tender will start in 2017 for at least two years. "Sanofi Pasteur MSD is dedicated to raising awareness of shingles and the importance of senior vaccine programmes across Europe," said Andrea Rappagliosi, Vice President Market Access, Medical Affairs and Health Policy at Sanofi Pasteur MSD. "The renewal of the shingles immunisation programme for the UK is a demonstration of NHS England's commitment to healthy ageing for seniors and serves as a model for other countries in protecting against shingles," he added. Zostavax® is an efficient and well-tolerated, one-dose vaccine supported by over 10 years of real-life evidence. The vaccine has been used for the national immunisation programme since September 2013. By the end of March 2016 just under half of eligible adults in the UK had been vaccinated against shingles,[1] representing a significant achievement and opportunity to build upon for the upcoming season. "Shingles is a painful and disruptive disease which can lead to severe complications and accelerates decline in health in senior populations," said Robert W Johnson, MD.,FRCA.,FFPMRCA., Hon. Senior Research Fellow, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Bristol, UK. "It's crucial that shingles vaccine coverage is as high as possible in the UK and across Europe to ensure the widest protection against the disease," he concluded.  UK disease coverage rates are an achievement but can be improved through ongoing efforts to identify and vaccinate all eligible individuals. A successful adult vaccination program relies on an effective vaccine that is easy to implement, ensuring it can be widely used in routine clinical practice. Zostavax® is licensed in the UK and across Europe for the immunisation of adults over 50 years and is given as a single injection[2] which supports vaccination adherence. Zostavax® has a well-established safety and tolerability profile from over 57,000 adults in clinical trials and over 32 million doses have been distributed worldwide since 2006, proving itself as an effective preventative measure available in a single dose with real-life experience in the primary care setting.[2],[3]   Several European countries have recently decided to recommend and/or fund Zostavax®, including Austria, Greece, UK and France, as well as some regions in Germany, Italy and Spain. Shingles is a common and debilitating viral disease caused by the reactivation of the varicella zoster virus that can affect one in four people at some point in their lifetime.[4] Approximately 1.7 million new cases of shingles appear every year in Europe.[5],[6] The risk of developing shingles more than doubles after the age of 50 years, and 2/3 shingles cases occur after the age of 50 years.[7]-[9] The WHO predicts that the number of people aged 60 years and over worldwide will increase to 2 billion by 2050.[10] This growing senior population has a higher susceptibility to infectious diseases and associated complications that can be prevented through vaccination. # # # About Zostavax®  Zostavax® is a live attenuated vaccine that appropriately boosts immune control of the dormant shingles virus, with 10 years of routine use in primary care providing strong evidence of effectiveness and good safety. The vaccine is designed to appropriately boost the varicella-zoster virus specific cellular immunity, which controls virus reactivation and/or replication.[2] It is the first available preventative means licensed in Europe against shingles and the long lasting nerve pain that may follow the disease, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN).[2] More than 32 million doses of Zostavax® have been distributed worldwide since 2006.[3] About Sanofi Pasteur MSD - http://www.spmsd.com Sanofi Pasteur MSD is a European joint venture formed between Sanofi Pasteur (the vaccine division of Sanofi) and Merck (known as MSD outside the United States and Canada). Combining innovation and expertise, Sanofi Pasteur MSD is the only European pharmaceutical company dedicated exclusively to the distribution of vaccines. Sanofi Pasteur MSD makes use of the combined expertise resulting from Sanofi Pasteur and Merck's research to focus on the development of new vaccines in Europe in order to produce the most effective, most acceptable and better tolerated vaccines. * This announcement was made in the UK in July 2016 and, hence, this press release is not being released in the UK.
