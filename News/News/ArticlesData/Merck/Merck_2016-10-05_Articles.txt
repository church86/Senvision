Merck KG, during an opening ceremony for the M-Lab collaboration center at the Techo Park IT Tower in Songdo, Incheon, Thursday. / Courtesy of Merck Korea By Yoon Sung-won SONGDO, Incheon ― Merck opened its ninth M-Lab collaboration center in Incheon, Thursday, as a channel to boost business ties with biopharmaceutical companies in Korea. At the opening ceremony, the German chemical and bio company highlighted its long-time partnership with Korean businesses and the country's aggressive drive to foster the biotechnology industry as the biggest reasons for establishing the collaboration center here. "We have run a business in Korea for more than 25 years and have closely cooperated with major businesses in their growth and success from the early stages," Merck Korea CEO Michael Grund said during a press conference in Songdo, Incheon. "Korea is looking for the next-generation growth engine from the biotechnology sector. We have opened the M-Lab center here to reenact the close cooperation that we had with the electronics and display panel industries in the past in the earliest stage of biotechnology here." The company said Korea has multiple new businesses in the bio sector with larger enterprises expanding manufacturing capacity of biopharmaceutical products such as biosimilars and vaccines. Besides the new M-Lab, Merck is operating multiple technology labs including liquid crystal display and organic light-emitting diode research facilities in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province. Including Korea, Merck has a total of nine M-Lab centers in Brazil, France, India, Singapore, Japan, China, Taiwan and the United States. Merck also stressed that it has chosen Songdo as the location for its M-Lab center because of its value as one of the fastest growing biotechnology hubs around the globe. "In Korea, we recognized that Songdo embraces one of the fastest growing biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries," Merck Life Science CEO Udit Batra said. "In addition, we have made additional investments to establish the center to meet requests from our clients here. We expect to do so again in the future." Merck said the M-Lab center replaces the existing facilities in Pangyo, Gyeonggi Province. According to Batra, Merck has invested about 10 million euros ($11.2 million) to upgrade the facility. "We decided to upgrade the facility after visiting Songdo two years ago to look around Samsung BioLogics' plant," Batra said. "At that time, I was impressed by spaces where I could virtually experience manufacturing facilities even without wearing a lab coat and actually going into the lines." Located on the 24th floor of Techno Park IT Tower in this city, the center will be operated by 10 Merck scientists and engineers. The new facility has actual manufacturing and testing environments to support an end-to-end production technology development. Clients will be able to test new practices and approaches in simplifying global technology transfer as well as manufacturing optimization and commercialization, the company said. "At the M-Lab Center, we are training clients' employees in development and production of bio products and we have our reservation list for this service fully booked for the next few months," Batra said. "In addition, customers can experience a demonstration of our products before deciding to buy them. They can also receive troubleshooting services if they face problems using them." Merck said M-Lab's clients will range from large enterprises to newborn businesses that develop cures for intractable diseases and tumors. In Korea, the German company has provided Samsung BioLogics and Celtrion with manufacturing technology and equipment for biopharmaceutical products. "Besides Samsung BioLogics and Celtrion, all businesses in the bio sector such as Korea Green Cross have contacted or worked with us," Batra said. "We are also closely cooperating with research and development agencies and seeking partnerships with more diverse bodies related to bio research and manufacturing." Samsung BioLogics CEO Kim Tae-han said, "The new M-Lab collaboration center will provide technological support for biopharmaceutical enterprises here and play a great role in training employees in this sector. Merck's decision to invest in Songdo is a milestone in the city's drive to foster the world's largest biopharmaceutical manufacturing hub with a total of 520,000 liters of production capacity by 2018. This will expedite the growth of both Korea's biopharmaceutical industry and Incheon's regional economy." yoonsw@ktimes.com 1. ONE MILLION protesters show people power 2.

Rick Sibbel, DVM and Executive Director of Technical Services at Merck Animal Health, speaks with ThePigSite's Sarah Mikesell about antibiotic stewardship.   "At Merck, we are very interested in the prevention of disease and that solution is vaccines, and as a result, we believe the more prevention of disease that you have, the less antibiotics that you will ultimately need," said Rick Sibbel, DVM and Executive Director of Technical Services at Merck Animal Health. "To that end, one of the exciting products that we're bringing to the swine industry is Porcilis Ileitis. Ileitis is an enteric disease, a chronic problematic disease where malabsorption occurs due to the organism that causes the enteric problem." Having been on the market for about eight months, Sibbel said producers are seeing great progress in the field. "We've already seen that when our producers use our ileitis vaccine, they see less enteric disease which means less antibiotic use. That's just one example of the sort of antibiotic justification and stewardship that we believe in at Merck," he said. "We will continue to look at the prevention scene using vaccination as a tool to help with the antibiotic decision process and the antibiotic justification process." Ileitis is a finisher disease, meaning late stage finishers tend to have most of the problems with ileitis. Typically, it's the result of diet, fast growth rate and bacteria on the farm. It is a very impactful disease, and as with many swine diseases, it's not a big problem for some operations, while others must deal with it almost every day, he said. "Ileitis is in every country of the world, so it is a global issue. It's an organism that is ubiquitous in swine operations, and we expect the vaccine to have some application beyond the US borders as it gets registered in other countries," Dr. Sibbel concluded.

Located in the heart of Korea’s fast-growing biotechnology hub, Merck’s M Lab Collaboration Center is designed to provide local clients such as Samsung BioLogics, Celltrion and Green Cross with more comprehensive training and research and development guidance as well as improved after-sales services.   Merck Korea CEO Michael Grund (left) poses with Merck Life Science CEO Udit Batra (right) and Frank Stangenberg-Haverkamp, chairman of Merck’s family board and its parent company E. Merck KG during the opening ceremony of the M-Lab collaboration center held at the Techno Park IT Center in Songdo, Incheon, Thursday. Merck Korea “At our new center in Incheon, our clients will benefit from our deep technical expertise to develop processes for manufacturing drugs faster, safer and more effectively than ever before,” Udit Batra, CEO of Merck’s Life Sciences Division, said during a press conference held at the center Thursday. The center will also serve as a marketing space to draw new purchases and clients by showcasing Merck’s flagship products — such as base materials used in producing biologic drugs, laboratory systems and manufacturing equipment for biopharma production. The German multinational company invested some 10 million euros ($11.2 million) into building the M Lab Collaboration Center in Korea — which expands the services previously offered by its Biomanufacturing Sciences & Training Center in Pangyo, Gyeonggi Province, built in 2012. It made the large-scale investment on the belief that Korea’s biotechnology sector will see robust growth in the years ahead, and in turn, boost the scale and competitiveness of Merck’s life sciences business in Korea, Batra said. The new Songdo-based M Lab also stands alongside others established by Merck worldwide — in the US, France, Brazil, India, China, Singapore, Japan, Taiwan. Looking ahead, Merck hopes to play a proactive role in supporting Korea’s new push into the biotechnology sector, similar to how it became a major supplier and partner to Korea’s top display-makers such as Samsung and LG from its early days, according to Merck Korea CEO Michael Grund. “The Korean industry is now moving in a different direction into the area of biotechnology and biopharmaceuticals, and consequently, we want to help them in the same way we did in the electronics area,” Grund said. Based in Darmstadt, Germany, Merck currently services diverse Korean clients in the field of life science, ranging from biopharma contract manufacturers and biologic drug developers to biotech start-ups, local academic institutions and research labs engaged in biotech research. The firm is also a major supplier of performance materials used for the production of liquid crystal displays as well as organic light-emitting diode panels.

The draft recommendation by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) applies to the treatment of advanced NSCLC whose tumours express PD-L1 and who have received at least one prior treatment with chemotherapy or a targeted anticancer regimen. The initial consultation document notes that despite a discount on Keytruda's £1,315 per 2mg/kg dose price tag and ability to extend lives, its use would likely see costs overshoot the range typically considered acceptable for routine NHS use. A major point of contention is the likely duration of treatment with Keytruda. Merck's modelling assumes patients will stop using pembrolizumab after two years if their disease has not worsened, while NICE believes that in practice it is unlikely that patients benefiting from treatment will stop taking it. Bristol-Myers Squibb's rival PD-1 inhibitor Opdivo (nivolumab) was given equally short shrift in lung cancer in draft guidance published by NICE in May. Despite evidence that the drug could extend overall survival than standard treatment with docetaxel - with fewer side effects - the agency said it was too expensive. The decision has been greeted with dismay by Merck (which operates as MSD in Europe). The company's UK managing director, Louise Houson, said the company was working with both NICE and NHS England "to ensure we can find a solution to get back on track". She said it was imperative that the "much needed treatment option is made available to people with previously treated advanced NSCLC as quickly as possible. This is particularly important as these patients have a very poor prognosis, with limited time". NICE has been taking an increasingly tough stance on cancer drug pricing, holding out for steep discounts in order to reduce the NHS' spending on medicines. The agency will be collecting comments on its assessment until 24 October. According to data from 2012, around 45,000 people in the UK are diagnosed with lung cancer each year, and survival rates lag behind those of some other European countries. Around 80% of those diagnosed with advanced disease die within a year. Keytruda was the first drug to be made available under the UK's Early Access to Medicines Scheme (EAMS) and has been made available at no cost to over 140 previously treated advanced NSCLC patients to date, said Merck. This initial recommendation will not affect patients currently receiving treatment, regardless of the funding arrangements in place for them, unless a clinical decision is taken to stop. New patients do not have access at this time and future access will depend on NICE's final guidance. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments.

"At our new center in Incheon, our customers will benefit from our deep technical expertise to develop processes for manufacturing drugs faster, safer and more effectively than ever before." The new M Lab™ Collaboration Center replaces a smaller facility in Seoul and will better suit the needs of Korea's growing biopharmaceutical market. The new, state-of-the-art center will include a simulated manufacturing environment and offer full end-to-end process development support. In addition, education on best practices and new approaches to develop, optimize and scale-up processes and simplify global technology transfer will be available to customers. With 1,865 square meters of space and more than ten highly trained scientists and engineers, the M Lab™ Collaboration Center will serve local biopharma manufacturers, spanning the spectrum from multinational organizations like Samsung Biologics to emerging companies developing biologics to treat rare diseases or different types of cancer. "The new M Lab™ Collaboration Center will play a great role in providing technical support and training of Korean biopharmaceutical employees," said TH Kim, CEO of Samsung BioLogics. "Merck's decision to invest in Songdo, fast growing as world largest biologics manufacturing hub with 520 KL of plant capacity by 2018, represents a significant milestone in the development of the Songdo Bio Cluster, which will accelerate the future growth of Incheon as well as Korean Biopharmaceutical industry." The new M Lab™ Collaboration Center in Incheon is one of nine such centers around the world. Each center allows pharmaceutical manufacturers to explore new ways to increase productivity, improve processes and mitigate risks by giving them access to a world-class team of experts. Customers have access to sizing and simulation tools and methodologies as well as analytical and modeling support. Formal bioprocessing educational courses are also available, including traditional classroom-style training and interactive, hands-on sessions.

In addition, education on best practices and new approaches to develop, optimize and scale-up processes and simplify global technology transfer will be available to customers. With 1,865 square meters of space and more than ten highly trained scientists and engineers, the M Lab' Collaboration Center will serve local biopharma manufacturers, spanning the spectrum from multinational organizations like Samsung Biologics to emerging companies developing biologics to treat rare diseases or different types of cancer. "The new M Lab' Collaboration Center will play a great role in providing technical support and training of Korean biopharmaceutical employees," said TH Kim, CEO of Samsung BioLogics. "Merck's decision to invest in Songdo, fast growing as world largest biologics manufacturing hub with 520 KL of plant capacity by 2018, represents a significant milestone in the development of the Songdo Bio Cluster, which will accelerate the future growth of Incheon as well as Korean Biopharmaceutical industry." The new M Lab' Collaboration Center in Incheon is one of nine such centers around the world. Each center allows pharmaceutical manufacturers to explore new ways to increase productivity, improve processes and mitigate risks by giving them access to a world-class team of experts. Customers have access to sizing and simulation tools and methodologies as well as analytical and modeling support. Formal bioprocessing educational courses are also available, including traditional classroom-style training and interactive, hands-on sessions.

Partnering activity is at a record high, with 60% more requests already compared to any previous year and 50% more meetings scheduled. The system is easier to use than ever. It includes a mobile app, integration with Outlook, Gmail or other calendars, and the ability to browse and schedule sessions and company presentations. BIO’s partnering system is built atop the Partneringplace CRM for pharma business development. That means a history of the companies you met at previous BIO events is at your fingertips. With rich task assignment and comment threads, you also can collaborate with colleagues who may not be coming to BIO Investor Forum for feedback and insights on companies. If you’d like to collaborate on your meeting strategy at BIO Investor Forum with a colleague who’s not attending, just send us their information at biopartnering@bio.org and we will add them in to Partneringplace! Finally Partneringplace makes meeting follow-up and note taking a breeze, and it’s free to use for BIO conferences. Be sure to click on Partneringplace in the BIO One-on-One Partnering menu to check it out. To help companies at the 2,000+ partnering meetings that will transpire at BIO Investor Forum, BIO hosted a webinar and asked Rajeev Dadoo (RD) from SR One, Karl Handelsman (KH) from Codon Capital and the Roche Venture Fund, Alex Szidon (AS) from Merck (West Coast Innovation Hub) and Ed Hurwitz (EH) from Precision BioVentures to give advice on how to make the most of partnering meetings. If you missed our mega web panel on how to pitch to investors and inlicensors, you should check out the recording: go.bio.org/BIF16Webinar.html. Here are some transcribed pieces of wisdom: How do you make the ideal pitch deck? “Don’t fall in love with your particular agent or delivery device. Fall in love with the solution to a problem and if you can connect an unmet need with a particular mechanism and show that you can connect the dots…if you can explain problem, solution, and attractability – that checks all boxes” - Alex Szidon, Merck (West Coast Innovation Hub) “Going back to the real basics you should know your audience and tailor the presentation. You need to be flexible so the discussion can change as it goes on if somebody gets interested in one particular point or topic.” - Rajeev Dadoo, SR One “Lead off with what makes you interesting to the group – tell me why you have a solution that is compelling” - Karl Handelsman, Codon Capital and the Roche Venture Fund “The only thing that will lose my interest immediately and never get a follow-up is if we never talk about mechanism of action.” - Ed Hurwitz, Precision BioVentures How much data do you need to have before seeking investment or outlicensing? “We like to see some biological/scientific rational around the target pathway mechanism. Why it might be different than current standard of care (if there is one). And why it might be differentiated – you might not have all the data, but at least a strong hypothesis.” - Rajeev Dadoo, SR One “What makes a poor impression is qualitative statements around ‘it’s a clean profile, there’s no tox.’ That just means you haven’t done the right experiments – it erodes the credibility of the team.” - Alex Szidon, Merck (West Coast Innovation Hub) “You should engage both with collaborators and investors even before you start the company and you’ll have a much higher success rate…learn what’s going on.” - Karl Handelsman, Codon Capital and the Roche Venture Fund “In general I would never do anything before your provisional patents at a minimum are filed and the IP is solidified. You need some expert advice on the IP side, always, before you would launch.” - Ed Hurwitz, Precision BioVentures How do you handle confidential information before CDA? “I would err on the side of not showing structures to people until very very very late and in some cases after you see some preliminary economic terms.” - Ed Hurwitz, Precision BioVentures “What moves us is data and so if there’s an impediment between those critical data and a company’s ability to share them, they need to remove them” - Alex Szidon, Merck (West Coast Innovation Hub) “It is a skill to be able to talk about what it is you’re doing without revealing the parts that make it confidential. You can talk a lot about what are the advantages, why it is that you have this thing – you can talk about a lot without giving the structure on even under CDA” - Karl Handelsman, Codon Capital and the Roche Venture Fund Use the tips from the webinar to wow potential partners at the BIO Investor Forum, BIO Latin America, the Sofinnova Japan Biopharma Partnering Conference, MedStartUp or any of the various conferences run by the BIO One-on-One Partnering system.

By Carina Storrs, Special to CNN Updated 12:29 AM ET, Wed October 5, 2016 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. JUST WATCHED Is this the cure to cancer? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Is this the cure to cancer? 03:28 Story highlights A new study projects that $3 billion worth of the most common cancer medicines will go to waste this year in the U.S. Drugs are wasted because manufacturers sell them in vials that are not practical to reuse Experts urge policies requiring pharmaceutical companies to package drugs differently or buy back unused drugs (CNN)Most shoppers wouldn't buy a gallon of milk if they thought they could only drink a pint's worth. So why are hospitals and clinics buying larger amounts of cancer therapies than they can use, forcing them to throw these expensive drugs in the trash? The answer, according to a new study, is that many of the top cancer drugs in the United States are only available in single-dose vials, and often that dose is more than the average patient needs. The result is an estimated $3 billion in overspending in the health care system each year, a cost that gets passed on to taxpayers and patients. In one of the more egregious examples, the pharmaceutical company Merck sells a melanoma drug, pembrolizumab, called Keytruda, in vials that contain 100 milligrams of the drug. A 150-pound patient gets about 140 milligrams of Keytruda, meaning that more than half of the second vial would not be used. Although some of the leftover drug might go to another patient, the study determined that on average, 21% of the drug, costing about $200 million, goes to waste. Big Pharma's big donations in 2016 presidential race The problem with Keytruda tipped researchers off to look at the amount of waste among the 20 most common drugs used to treat a range of cancers, including breast, prostate, skin and colorectal. Waste was rampant. "I don't think we thought we'd find multiple drugs with double-digit percentage of the vials wasted, and that is what we found," said Dr. Peter B. Bach, director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Bach is the lead author of the study, which was published on Tuesday in The BMJ journal. Read More There was a large spread among the top 20 cancer medicines in how much of a vial is typically thrown out, from 1% up to 37%. The amount of waste was typically lower for medicines that were available in several single-dose vial options containing a range of doses. Sharing vials between patients also reduced waste, but this is generally only practical at hospitals treating large numbers of cancer patients, not at doctor's offices. Pharmaceuticals cheaper abroad because of regulation Bach and his colleagues estimate that the companies producing the top 20 cancer medicines, including Genentech, Takeda and Onyx Pharmaceuticals, will make nearly $2 billion this year just from wasted drops of these most common cancer drugs. And doctors and hospitals will make $1 billion in markup fees from these tossed treatments. Although insurance companies pick up the tab, it ultimately affects the entire population by driving up taxes and insurance premiums. "The fact that we have insurance doesn't mean someone else is paying the bills -- we are paying the bills," Bach said. Will voters help control the cost of prescription drugs? Waste might be especially bad in the United States compared with other countries. Takeda's myeloma drug, bortezomib, called Velcade, is only available in 3.5-milligram vials in the United States, but the average patient only needs 2.5 milligrams. More appropriately sized 1-milligram vials are available in the United Kingdom. In a statement, a Takeda spokeswoman said the company "worked closely with the FDA to establish the Velcade vial size of 3.5 mg to ensure that one vial would provide an adequate amount of the drug for a patient of almost any size." The company does not have plans to introduce additional vial size options to the U.S. market, the email statement said. In another example, Merck stopped selling its 50-milligram vials of Keytruda in the United States last year. These smaller vials had less potential for waste than the 100-milligram vials that replaced them. But in Europe, where agencies can participate in drug pricing decisions, the 50-milligram vial is still available. According to a statement from Merck, "our understanding of dosing in multiple tumor types has improved." The company is now conducting trials of 200-milligram Keytruda vials, which it says would "eliminate wastage." However according to Bach, this strategy would only mean that more wasted medicine is administered to patients instead of thrown away. "Their new plan is to change the dose so all patients get all of the drug," but studies so far do not suggest the higher dose would carry any benefit for patients, Bach said. Bach and his colleagues suggest two possible solutions for reigning in cancer drug waste: Require companies to provide drugs in vials that contain more appropriate doses or require companies to refund the expense of leftover drug. "I think either one is pretty doable," Bach said. "The (Food and Drug Administration) could definitely issue a much more instructive guidance on vial size where they ask companies to take into account this exact issue, and they can do that without an act of Congress. ... Companies know the market and their regulators and will generally respond to that." Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter. The current study is "excellent," said Dr. Daniel A. Goldstein, an adjunct assistant professor of medical oncology at Emory University and senior physician at Rabin Medical Center in Israel. "As the elections are coming upon us and there's increased discussion about the possibility of legislation to try to impact the pricing mechanism of cancer drugs, this paper is telling us one piece of legislation is to ensure drug companies are forced to provide multiple different options of vial sizes," Goldstein said. Referring to the milk analogy, Goldstein said that drugs should give you the option to buy them in the pint and gallon equivalents. Wasted cancer drugs is only one small part of overspending in healthcare in the U.S. compared with contributors such as excessive use of diagnostic testing and end-of-life care, Goldstein said. At the same time, he added that, "those are very complicated to solve, but this is an extremely simple thing to solve. Content by LendingTree Rates hit 2.75% APR (15 yr).

Digital therapeutics -- "software as a drug" -- deploys software modules as an enhancement, or even a substitute, to a drug. It is poised to become a critical component of digital health and to substantially improve the efficiency of American healthcare. Psilos, a prominent digital health venture and growth stage investment firm, says digital therapeutics improves health outcomes by addressing chronic conditions through behavioral changes, before they become worse. The new generation of digital therapeutics is demonstrating clinical efficacy by marrying the latest developments in behavioral economics, smartphones, game-ification, biometric sensors, data analytics and artificial intelligence. The long-term goal of digital therapeutics is to bend the healthcare cost curve. Digital therapeutics is an important piece of healthcare's ongoing transition from "volume to value" to improve patients' health and complement in-office care, especially for tens of millions of patients in the early stages of chronic conditions, such as Type 2 diabetes, anxiety and stress disorders, and drug addictions. For these people, health self-management outside of a traditional medical setting is a major determinant of disease progression, as well as healthcare costs. Digital Therapeutics is a Huge Investment Opportunity The digital therapeutics market, currently a nascent, sub-$1 billion market, is poised to become a $6 billion market in five years, based on a recent research report by Goldman Sachs, supplemented by Psilos analysis. Joe Riley, a managing partner of Psilos Group and one of the authors of the report, said investments in digital therapeutics are being fueled by major healthcare players such as Merck, Johnson & Johnson and Amgen. "The potential growth of digital therapeutics is enormous and represents an incredible venture investment opportunity," Riley said. "As the moniker 'software as a drug' implies, digital therapeutics is delivering measurable and scientifically valid clinical endpoints by tying patients and health professionals together with web and phone interactions. Successful treatment of chronic diseases requires motivated, self-guided and persistent engagement, and this is where digital technology enters the picture and where we see the major investment opportunity," Riley added. Steve Krupa, another Psilos managing partner, said digital therapeutics combines proven clinical protocols and the science of behavioral economics with the collection, analysis and communication of patient data in real-time, using smart devices. "Today, the bulk of spending in American healthcare is focused on preventable, chronic diseases overwhelmingly rooted in behavior patterns," Krupa said. "This is a big piece of the overall solution to begin reversing an overwhelming problem once and for all." Companies Already Successful in Digital Therapeutics: HealthMine and Pear Therapeutics Two companies making progress in digital therapeutics include HealthMine, a Psilos portfolio investment, and Pear Therapeutics. HealthMine works behind the scenes of healthcare plans to compile data on the complete health of their members daily, including their medical and pharmaceutical histories and lab results. The information is processed through HealthMine's proprietary platform, which searches for irregularities such as abnormal heart rates, high glucose readings and high body mass indexes. For members whose health readout is suspect, HealthMine prescribes tailored programs from its 3,500 specific and actionable recommendations. Results have been impressive. A three-year HealthMine study of 120,000 people enrolled in its wellness programs found that far more than average visited doctors for preventive reasons accounting for 10 to 20 percent fewer hospital admissions, bed days and emergency room visits in the first year. Additional Validation Pear Therapeutics develops software and other products for a wide range of behavioral health disorders. Its digital therapies, called E-formulations, are mobile digital therapies that provide patients with a set of rewards linked to abstinence and completion of software modules. One such product is reSET, a treatment tool used in conjunction with face-to-face therapy to treat substance abuse disorders. More than 500 patients with substance abuse disorders in 10 treatment centers were split into two camps for 12 weeks of testing -- those who received traditional face-to-face therapy only and those who received a reduced amount of therapy plus reSET. Abstinence was measured twice weekly. Among patients who tested positive for drug use at the start of the study, 27 percent were abstinent in study weeks nine through 12, compared to only 3 percent of patients in the same period who relied on face-to-face therapy alone.

Digital therapeutics -- "software as a drug" -- deploys software modules as an enhancement, or even a substitute, to a drug. It is poised to become a critical component of digital health and to substantially improve the efficiency of American healthcare. Psilos, a prominent digital health venture and growth stage investment firm, says digital therapeutics improves health outcomes by addressing chronic conditions through behavioral changes, before they become worse. The new generation of digital therapeutics is demonstrating clinical efficacy by marrying the latest developments in behavioral economics, smartphones, game-ification, biometric sensors, data analytics and artificial intelligence. The long-term goal of digital therapeutics is to bend the healthcare cost curve. Digital therapeutics is an important piece of healthcare's ongoing transition from "volume to value" to improve patients' health and complement in-office care, especially for tens of millions of patients in the early stages of chronic conditions, such as Type 2 diabetes, anxiety and stress disorders, and drug addictions. For these people, health self-management outside of a traditional medical setting is a major determinant of disease progression, as well as healthcare costs. Digital Therapeutics is a Huge Investment Opportunity The digital therapeutics market, currently a nascent, sub-$1 billion market, is poised to become a $6 billion market in five years, based on a recent research report by Goldman Sachs, supplemented by Psilos analysis. Joe Riley, a managing partner of Psilos Group and one of the authors of the report, said investments in digital therapeutics are being fueled by major healthcare players such as Merck, Johnson & Johnson and Amgen. "The potential growth of digital therapeutics is enormous and represents an incredible venture investment opportunity," Riley said. "As the moniker 'software as a drug' implies, digital therapeutics is delivering measurable and scientifically valid clinical endpoints by tying patients and health professionals together with web and phone interactions. Successful treatment of chronic diseases requires motivated, self-guided and persistent engagement, and this is where digital technology enters the picture and where we see the major investment opportunity," Riley added. Steve Krupa, another Psilos managing partner, said digital therapeutics combines proven clinical protocols and the science of behavioral economics with the collection, analysis and communication of patient data in real-time, using smart devices. "Today, the bulk of spending in American healthcare is focused on preventable, chronic diseases overwhelmingly rooted in behavior patterns," Krupa said. "This is a big piece of the overall solution to begin reversing an overwhelming problem once and for all." Companies Already Successful in Digital Therapeutics: HealthMine and Pear Therapeutics Two companies making progress in digital therapeutics include HealthMine, a Psilos portfolio investment, and Pear Therapeutics. HealthMine works behind the scenes of healthcare plans to compile data on the complete health of their members daily, including their medical and pharmaceutical histories and lab results. The information is processed through HealthMine's proprietary platform, which searches for irregularities such as abnormal heart rates, high glucose readings and high body mass indexes. For members whose health readout is suspect, HealthMine prescribes tailored programs from its 3,500 specific and actionable recommendations. Results have been impressive. A three-year HealthMine study of 120,000 people enrolled in its wellness programs found that far more than average visited doctors for preventive reasons accounting for 10 to 20 percent fewer hospital admissions, bed days and emergency room visits in the first year. Additional Validation Pear Therapeutics develops software and other products for a wide range of behavioral health disorders. Its digital therapies, called E-formulations, are mobile digital therapies that provide patients with a set of rewards linked to abstinence and completion of software modules. One such product is reSET, a treatment tool used in conjunction with face-to-face therapy to treat substance abuse disorders. More than 500 patients with substance abuse disorders in 10 treatment centers were split into two camps for 12 weeks of testing -- those who received traditional face-to-face therapy only and those who received a reduced amount of therapy plus reSET. Abstinence was measured twice weekly. Among patients who tested positive for drug use at the start of the study, 27 percent were abstinent in study weeks nine through 12, compared to only 3 percent of patients in the same period who relied on face-to-face therapy alone. Other Pear software-based clinical interventions are under development for the treatment of insomnia, traumatic brain injury, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, depression and acute and chronic pain. Excellent Growth Potential for Digital Therapeutics These commercial developments and others demonstrate that digital therapeutics, while still relatively nascent, is on a trajectory that will inevitably move up and to the right, Riley said. "Only recently has behavior modification been embraced as a first-line therapeutic alternative to pills for many of society's most challenging and costly chronic conditions," he said. "Now it's starting to get a bigger lift from digital therapy, and this is a key advance in how America can successfully combat the chronic disease epidemic."

The new M Lab Collaboration Center replaces a smaller facility in Seoul and will better suit the needs of Korea's growing biopharmaceutical market. The new, state of-the art center will include a simulated manufacturing environment and offer full end-to-end process development support. The center in Incheon, which is one of nine such centers around the world, provides biopharmaceutical manufacturers with a shared, exploratory environment. In the center, they can closely collaborate with MilliporeSigma scientists and engineers to accelerate development and production of new therapies. Udit Batra, CEO, MilliporeSigma, said, 'With a rapidly growing biopharmaceutical industry in Korea and demand for novel and cost-effective therapies worldwide, there is a clear need for innovative concepts like our M Lab Collaboration Centers.' MilliporeSigma said its decision to invest in Songdo, fast growing as world largest biologics manufacturing hub with 520 KL of plant capacity by 2018, represents a significant milestone in the development of the Songdo Bio Cluster. It is expected that the Cluster will accelerate the future growth of Incheon as well as Korean Biopharmaceutical industry.

Cheryl Swanson (CherylSwanson) Oct 5, 2016 at 9:45PM Image source: Getty Images. Drug giant Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) is back full circle. After years of Wall Street speculation about whether the company would split into stand-alone parts, CEO Ian Read recently announced management's decision: no split. You could almost hear the collective gnashing of teeth by investment bankers, who thereby lost millions of dollars in transaction fees. But let's not waste any tears on that group, because this stock is back in the game. With Pfizer down almost 10% from its August high, shares are approaching the point where they present an opportunity for long-term investors. That's particularly true for income seekers, because Pfizer's dividend now yields 3.5%, the third-highest dividend in drug stocks. Of course, like practically every big pharma, Pfizer has struggled with the loss of exclusivity on key drugs -- notably Lipitor, once the best-selling drug of all time. But Pfizer has introduced a number of fast-selling therapies recently, and its pipeline and mergers and acquisitions provide major growth opportunities. Let's quickly review three reasons to buy as well as two near-term risks.   Appealing dividend for yield-starved investors Only two major drug manufacturers offer a higher dividend yield than Pfizer: GlaxoSmithKline at 5.1%, and Sanofi at 4.4%. But there are questions about the safety of Glaxo's superior dividend, with its lead drug Advair facing the risk of generic competition in one to three years. And Sanofi's stock is down in the dumps, with its key diabetes market franchise under pressure from heavy competition and patents on best-seller insulin Lantus having expired. Meanwhile, a 3.5% dividend is nothing to sneeze at, not in today's yield-starved world. While nothing beats Johnson & Johnson's 53-year track record of dividend increases, here's Pfizer's comparative performance on other key dividend metrics: Data source: FactSet. Table by author. Blockbuster revenue from superstar drugs Pfizer's new drugs are providing more than protection against various diseases; they are providing generous protection for Pfizer's growth and earnings as well. Pfizer's heavy-hitter breast cancer med Ibrance looks set to be a $4 billion drug. Last quarter, it generated $514 million globally, which was not too shabby for its fourth quarter of commercial availability. Assuming Ibrance can be expanded to new indications -- which seems likely based on its outsized success in its phase 3 Paloma trials -- this drug is just getting started. Also showing up strong last quarter, and likely in future quarters, was Eliquis, for stroke prevention, and Xeljanz, for rheumatoid arthritis. But it's Pfizer's Prevnar-led vaccine franchise that is doing the heavy lifting right now. Going back to full-year 2015, the franchise notched $6.25 billion in revenue. Comparatively, Merck KGaA's HPV vaccines trailed at a far-distant second place of $2.47 billion a year. Pfizer's vaccines showed huge 40% year-over-year growth (or more) each quarter in 2015. While growth slowed in 2016, Prevnar received expanded FDA approval in adults 19 to 49 this July. That could see it begin ramping back up again. Pfizer's fast-growing therapies are not just making up for patent losses; they led the new-drug division to 17% operational growth year over year in the second quarter. Overall, the division's revenue clocked in at $13.1 billion, a year-over-year change of 11% over $11.9 billion in the same period last year. Pipeline and acquisitions recharging the batteries Long-term growth in a company such as Pfizer is built around its pipeline and acquisitions. Fortunately for the drug maker, it has one of the largest pipelines in the industry, with over 90 clinical trials ongoing. Of the nine drugs in registration phase, several should provide near-term catalysts. Avelumab (co-developed with Merck KGaA) has a blockbuster sales potential of $4 billion to $6 billion, although Merck KGaA would claim the lion's share of the revenue. Meanwhile, a drug from Pfizer's buyout of Anacor Pharmaceuticals, eczema treatment crisaborole, could see sales of $2 billion, with a regulatory decision in January 2017. In terms of other acquisitions, the biggest headline in biotech in recent weeks was Pfizer's $14 billion buyout of Medivation. The prize netted was Xtandi, a prostate cancer drug which saw $2.2 billion in sales over the past year. Pfizer has a bold plan for growth in oncology, and with Xtandi's sales projected to reach $4.8 billion by 2020, the company now owns two of the top 10 leading cancer drugs.  Image source: Pfizer. And then there's Pfizer's $17 billion acquisition of biosimilars giant Hospira, which is already paying off big time. Thanks to Hospira, Pfizer's slower-growing essential health division posted 19% operational growth in the last quarter year over year. What could go wrong? Two words of caution Pfizer presents a company-specific risk in CEO Ian Read's ill-advised hunger for megadeals. Read took a proverbial pie in the face when Pfizer's 2014 leap at British-based AstraZeneca failed. Seemingly undeterred, that was followed by another ill-fated megamerger attempt with Ireland's Allergan. Fortunately, more recently, Read has been focusing on smaller bolt-on acquisitions, such as Anacor Pharmaceuticals and Medivation. But there's no guarantee he has actually learned. The other risk is that Pfizer has been fending off relentless pressure from analysts to break up for years, so we could see analyst downgrades coming. Since these tend to come in groups, that could pressure shares. On the other hand, earlier this year Pfizer approved a $5 billion accelerated stock repurchase, which could help put a floor under the share price. All in all, the catalysts for outperformance are out there for this blue chip. And for those who aren't overly concerned with the chance for more downside on the short term, I'd say -- don't dive in headfirst, for heaven's sake. But consider dipping in a toe -- the water should be fine. Cheryl Swanson owns shares of Allergan and Johnson and Johnson. The Motley Fool recommends AstraZeneca and Johnson and Johnson.

Korea as new hub 2016/10/05 17:59 Tweet Facebook Share Google +1 Reduce Enlarge Print By Kim Han-joo SEOUL, Oct. 5 (Yonhap) -- Global health care companies are ramping up their research and development (R&D) investment in South Korea as the country emerges as a new global biotech and medical industry hub, industry officials said Wednesday. GE Healthcare Korea said it will build the first APAC Fast Trak Center in Songdo in the western port city of Incheon by investing a total of US$20 million by 2020, in an effort to cultivate talent in the industry. The company said the center is aimed at addressing the challenge of the sector in human resources which many of the leading bio players are facing. The center will help bio pharmaceutical companies improve production efficiency and reduce costs as well. "We're delighted to open our new Fast Trak Center in South Korea that has the flourishing sector and some of the world's leading innovative biopharmaceutical companies. We are looking forward to further support the growth of the industry and provide access to latest technologies and our global competence locally," said Kieran Murphy, president and CEO of GE Healthcare's Life Science, in a press release. The center will provide practical training and manufacturing support by collaborating with local educational institutions, company officials said. "The center will be a base for R&D collaboration for biopharmaceuticals and biosimilars with local conglomerates and bio venture companies," said Song Mi-ok, a GE Healthcare official. Biosimilars refer to a biological medical product which is almost an identical copy of an original product. The company said Songdo is already home to a number of leading South Korean biopharmaceutical companies, and excellent national and international transport links. (Photo courtesy of GE Healthcare) Merck KGaA, Germany-based leading science and technology company, will also open a biotech center in Songdo on Thursday, industry analysts said. The Biotech Training Center, dubbed "M-Lab," will support other major local pharmaceutical firms in production and R&D, they said. The company has been working with major local biopharmaceutical firms -- Samsung Group's biotech unit Samsung BioLogics Co. and Celltrion Inc. -- to develop biosimilars. The center will act as a catalyst for the firm to join forces with local drug makers to expand their global presence in the field, the analysts said. Udit Batra, a member of the executive board of Merck, will attend the opening ceremony and announce details of the center and the outlook of the bio industry, they said. The company said it will officially announce the details of the center on Thursday, refusing to further comment. Johnson & Johnson's JLab in San Francisco. (Yonhap file photo) Johnson & Johnson is also reviewing South Korea as a candidate to house its biotech incubator, J LAB. The center would be the first to be established outside of the North American region, the analysts said. The company currently has five J LABs in the United States and one in Canada, providing entrepreneurs with a shared lab space and offices as well as access to capital funding. The facilities accommodate startups and other companies that represent a range of sectors including therapeutics, medical devices and consumer health solutions. South Korea's bio industry has witnessed robust growth in the past few years, with the exports of biopharmaceutical products jumping 34 percent on-year in 2015. South Korea has an ambitious target to increase pharmaceutical exports to 23 trillion won by 2020. Earlier, South Korea rolled out a package of measures to fuel the growth of the country's biohealth industry, aiming to become a global powerhouse in the sector and add nearly 1 million new jobs. Under the plan, South Korea aims to become a global bio-tech and medical industry hub by investing more in R&D on medicine, medical devices and cosmetics. The government forecast that 940,000 new jobs will be created by 2020 in the industry that is widely viewed as the nation's next growth engine after IT. Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn holds a meeting in Songdo in the western port city of Incheon on March 31, 2016, to discuss measures to boost biotech and medical industry.

ReCell is an investigational medical device that enables medical professionals to collect cells from a small sample of a patient's own skin to create a suspension that can regenerate wounds caused by burns. A pivotal trial of ReCell, which is underway, is expected to be completed in early 2017, following which an application for Pre Market Approval will be submitted. The company hopes its ReCell device to be approved before the end of 2017. AVMXY.OB closed Tuesday's trading at $1.53, up 3.38%. Catabasis Pharmaceuticals Inc. (CATB) has completed target enrollment of 30 patients in Part B of its phase II trial of Edasalonexent for the potential treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. The company has previously reported positive safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and biomarker results from Part A of the trial. Top-line safety and efficacy results from the phase 2 trial, dubbed MoveDMD, are now anticipated in the first half of Q1 2017 compared to previous estimate of late year 2016. CATB closed Tuesday's trading at $5.40, down 6.74%. In after-hours, the stock fell another 1.30% to $5.33. Five Prime Therapeutics Inc. (FPRX) has initiated the phase 1b portion of its phase 1a/1b trial evaluating the immunotherapy combination of Cabiralizumab with Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) approved drug OPDIVO in multiple tumor types. The phase 1a portion of the trial evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics and biomarkers of escalating doses of Cabiralizumab as a monotherapy, as well as in combination with the approved OPDIVO. Cabiralizumab is also in a phase 2 clinical trial in pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) and a phase 1 clinical trial in oncology indications. The drug candidate is being developed under an agreement entered into with Bristol-Myers in October 2015. FPRX closed Tuesday's trading at $52.48, up 1.02%. NewLink Genetics Corp.'s (NLNK) subsidiary has been awarded a contract again, this time valued at $24.8 million, by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, to support the advanced development of investigational Ebola Zaire vaccine candidate. The vaccine, known as V920, is tagged as 'Breakthrough Therapy' by the FDA and as PRIME (PRIority MEdicine) by the European Medicines Agency. Merck (MRK) holds the exclusive rights to develop and distribute V920 in the United States and Canada. NewLink previously received $76.8 million in contracts from BARDA for the development of V920. NLNK closed Tuesday's trading at $14.69, down 1.54%. Ocular Therapeutix Inc. (OCUL) has begun enrollment in the first of two planned phase III clinical trials with OTX-TP for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension. The study is expected to enroll approximately 550 patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension at 50 clinical sites. Top-line results from this study are expected to be available in the first half of 2018. The company plans to commence the second phase 3 clinical trial of OTX-TP in the first half of 2017. A phase III clinical trial of its most advanced product candidate DEXTENZA for post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain is underway, with topline results expected to be available in the fourth quarter of 2016. OCUL closed Tuesday's trading at $6.96, up 1.61%. Otonomy Inc. (OTIC) has successfully completed a phase II clinical trial that evaluated a single administration of OTIPRIO, in two dose levels of 6 mg and 12 mg, for the treatment of pediatric patients with acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes. According to the trial results, both OTIPRIO doses were well-tolerated, achieved higher and statistically significant clinical cure rates over sham (no treatment), with the highest clinical cure rate observed in the 12 mg dose group. OTIPRIO is approved for the treatment of pediatric patients with bilateral otitis media with effusion undergoing tympanostomy tube placement surgery. OTIC closed Tuesday's trading at $17.55, down 0.45%. pSivida Corp.'s (PSDV) second phase III trial of Medidur in chronic, non-infectious posterior segment uveitis has met its target enrollment of 150 patients. The first phase III Medidur trial met the primary efficacy endpoint of prevention of recurrence of posterior segment uveitis at six months in December 2015. The second phase III study has the same study design and endpoints as the first phase III trial. The primary efficacy endpoint readout in the second study is expected in the second half of 2017. PSDV closed Tuesday's trading at $2.83, down 3.74%. It looks like RespireRx Pharmaceuticals Inc. (RSPI.OB) will have to re-analyze the previously reported data from its phase 2A trial of CX1739, as the company has now discovered an error that went noticed until yesterday. The phase 2A trial evaluated the safety as well as the ability of CX1739 to antagonize the respiratory depressive effect of remifentanil (REMI), a potent opioid, without altering its analgesic properties. According to the trial results reported last month, CX1739 was proven to be safe and well tolerated, and antagonized the respiratory depressive effects of remifentanil. Now that an error has been discovered in the data, the company believes that it will effect the efficacy data analysis, although the extent of the effect is not known at this point of time. However, the safety data is expected to remain unchanged. RSPI.OB closed Tuesday's trading at $4.00, down 5.88%. Shares of Summit Therapeutics plc (SMMT) rose as much as 128% on Tuesday, following a $562 million license and collaboration agreement, it inked with Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT). As per the agreement terms, Sarepta has gained rights in Europe, as well as in Turkey and the Commonwealth of Independent States to Summit's utrophin modulator pipeline, including its lead clinical candidate, Ezutromid, for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Sarepta also has the option for Latin American rights. Summit's Ezutromid is under a phase II trial, dubbed PhaseOut DMD, and 24-week biopsy data from initial group of patients are expected in Q2/Q3 2017. The deal entitles Summit to receive an upfront payment of $40 million, with potential future Ezutromid-related milestone payments totaling up to $522 million plus royalties. As you may know, Sarepta's Exondys 51 was granted accelerated approval by the FDA last month, becoming the first drug to be approved in the U.S. to treat patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. SMMT touched a 52-week high of $19.75 on Tuesday, before closing the day's trading at $14.35, up 65.90%. Shares of Trinity Biotech plc (TRIB) plunged over 50% on Tuesday, following withdrawal of its 510(k) premarket notification submission for the Meritas Troponin-I Test and Meritas Point-of-Care Analyzer due to concerns associated with clinical performance of the device. According to the company, the Troponin-I clinical performance is not consistent with the clinical performance data presented by the most recently cleared laboratory Troponin device. The company said, 'Our decision to withdraw is based on the fact that, notwithstanding its excellent performance characteristics, we believe that there is no certainty that this level of performance can be achieved by the Meritas product even with the benefit of further development efforts'. TRIB dropped to a 52-week low of $5.76 on Tuesday, before closing the day's trading at $6.46, down 50.27%.

CATB closed Tuesday's trading at $5.40, down 6.74%. In after-hours, the stock fell another 1.30% to $5.33. Five Prime Therapeutics Inc. (FPRX) has initiated the phase 1b portion of its phase 1a/1b trial evaluating the immunotherapy combination of Cabiralizumab with Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) approved drug OPDIVO in multiple tumor types. The phase 1a portion of the trial evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics and biomarkers of escalating doses of Cabiralizumab as a monotherapy, as well as in combination with the approved OPDIVO. Cabiralizumab is also in a phase 2 clinical trial in pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) and a phase 1 clinical trial in oncology indications.

(RSPI.OB) will have to re-analyze the previously reported data from its phase 2A trial of CX1739, as the company has now discovered an error that went noticed until yesterday. The phase 2A trial evaluated the safety as well as the ability of CX1739 to antagonize the respiratory depressive effect of remifentanil (REMI), a potent opioid, without altering its analgesic properties. According to the trial results reported last month, CX1739 was proven to be safe and well tolerated, and antagonized the respiratory depressive effects of remifentanil. Now that an error has been discovered in the data, the company believes that it will effect the efficacy data analysis, although the extent of the effect is not known at this point of time. However, the safety data is expected to remain unchanged. RSPI.OB closed Tuesday's trading at $4.00, down 5.88%.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with YHOO. Click here to check it out. ABBV 15-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of ABBV Peter Lynch Chart of ABBV "We identified 24 cases of HBV reactivation reported to FDA and from the published literature in HCV/HBV co-infected patients treated with DAAs during the 31 months from Nov. 22, 2013 to July 18. This number includes only cases submitted to FDA so there are likely additional cases about which we are unaware. Of the cases reported, two patients died and one required a liver transplant." (FDA) During the clinical trials, the DAA was tested on patients infected with HCV only, excluding those who were co-infected with HBV because the FDA wanted to assess the risk of developing side effects on patients with HCV only. In the clinical trials the possibility that this type of treatment could lead to a reactivation of hepatitis B virus on HCV patients who also had HBV was not taken into account. That's why the FDA is now requiring adding the boxed warning to the labels of these medications. The black-box warning refers to Sovaldi and Harvoni from Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD), Viekira Pak from AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) and Zepatier from Merck & Co. (MRK). View photos Source: FDA But what is not clear from the FDA's safety announcement is how many HCV/HBV co-infected patients were treated with these prominent and expensive medications. Twenty-four cases of HBV reactivation in 31 months seems to be a statistically insignificant number. Approximately 3% of the world's population (150 million to 200 million people) live with chronic hepatitis C and about 3.5 million new diagnoses of infection from hepatitis C virus are made every year. There are different genotypes of the virus and the World Health Organization (WHO) has implemented a classification that includes 11 genotypes. In the U.S., about 70% of hepatitis C infection cases are just related to genotype 1. Revenue from the sale of direct-acting antiviral drugs for the treatment of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) accounts for approximately 23% of total net revenues of Gilead Sciences, AbbVie and Merck combined. The figures will increase as Viekira Pak receives approval from additional geographies, and Zepatier receives approval from the EU where it is currently under review for the treatment of chronic HCV. AbbVie and Merck have gained 10% and 20% on the New York Stock Exchange year to date. Gilead Sciences has lost 21% on the NASDAQ. View photos AbbVie is trading around $62.93 versus average analysts price target of $71.28, Merck is trading around $61.97, and Gilead is trading around $76.80 versus average analysts price target of $102.94. All are down slightly compared to the previous trading day. Disclosure: I have no position in any stock mentioned in this article. Start a free seven-day trial of Premium Membership to GuruFocus.

Administrator: Mylan Has Overcharged Medicaid For EpiPen By At Least 10% Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Administrator: Mylan Has Overcharged Medicaid For EpiPen By At Least 10% Image courtesy of Phillip Bradshaw October 6, 2016 2:21 pm EST By Chris Morran@themorrancave oh mylan-ta epipen Mylan cms medicaid drug prices Though the EpiPen emergency allergy treatment has been around for decades, the increased demand for the drug and its soaring price tag have caused Medicaid spending on EpiPen to go from around $66 million in 2011 to $365 million in 2015. All this time, claims Andrew Slavitt, Acting Administrator for the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Mylan’s parent company has been shortchanging Medicaid on rebates. As we’ve mentioned in previous stories, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires drugmakers to pay back a portion of their Medicaid revenue to the states through rebates. The size of those rebates is determined by whether the drug is considered an “innovator” medication (often a newer, higher-cost drug with little or no competition) or a “non-innovator multiple source” (NIMS) drug (often an older drug with competition from generics). Since 2010, the rebate rate for a NIMS drug is 13% of the average manufacturer price during the rebate period. Innovator drugs face a significantly higher rebate, of at least 23.1%. Drug companies are effectively on their honor to properly categorize a drug with the rebate program, though any drugmaker found to have deliberately mis-categorized an innovator drug as NIMS to avoid the higher rebate rate could face significant penalties. Which brings us to EpiPen. In a letter [PDF] sent yesterday to Sen. Ron Wyden (OR), Acting Administrator Slavitt confirms earlier reports that CMS had recently determined that Mylan had inaccurately categorized EpiPen as a NIMS drug. In fact, the NIMS categorization goes back two decades, long before Mylan acquired EpiPen as part of its purchase of Merck’s generics business. Toward the end of 1997, the company that then owned EpiPen changed the classification from single-source to multiple-source, even though competition in this market has been few and far between. “EpiPen is approved under a New Drug Application by the Food and Drug Administration, has patent protection, and has no FDA-approved therapeutic equivalents,” writes Slavitt. “These facts indicate EpiPen does not meet the definition of a multiple source drug, but, in fact, meets the definition of a single source drug or brand drug.” Between 2011 and 2015, according to the letter, Medicaid has paid a total of $960 million toward EpiPen purchases. Because of the NIMS classification, Mylan has only paid a rebate rate of 13%. Medicaid’s net spending on the drug during those years was around $797 million, but should have been significantly less, claims Slavitt, who claims the CMS has expressly told Mylan that EpiPen is mis-classified. He also notes that CMS has not yet determined how much Mylan should owe because of this alleged error. “When it comes to CMS’s attention that the manufacturer’s categorization is incorrect, CMS notifies the manufacturer and tries to reach an agreement,” he explains. Manufacturers caught incorrectly categorizing drugs in the rebate program could be in violation of the False Claims Act for overcharging the government, which comes with potential financial penalties. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrissey has already announced that his office is actively investigating whether or not EpiPen’s apparent mis-categorization amounts to Medicaid fraud. Last week, several U.S. senators wrote to Attorney General Loretta Lynch calling for the Department of Justice to probe this matter.

The global ion-exchange chromatography market is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 4.96% during the period 2016-2020. According to the report, rise in global expenditure on R&D is one of the drivers promoting growth. The global expenditure on R&D has shown consistent growth in the last 10 years. It went up from $522 billion in 1996 to $1.3 trillion in 2009. In 2014, it was an estimated $1.6 trillion. With the economies of developing countries growing faster than that of developed countries, these emerging countries are expected to have more research facilities and institutes being set up over the next five years. This increase in the number of research and testing facilities, particularly in the field of pharmaceutical and biotechnology, will lead to a rise in demand for laboratory analysis equipment such as ion exchange chromatography instruments, reagents, and other consumables. Further, the report states that high TCO is one of the challenges that the market is facing. On average, any chromatography instrument or system will set a user back by an estimated $3,900. The cost will increase when the system needs to be customized to the working environment, which includes adding accessories that need to be purchased with it or customizing its sample handling settings. The cost of the equipment also depends on the level of accuracy that they can provide when it comes to processing, detection, and analyzing.

The Investor talked with various corporate representatives to see how they are coping with the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act that went into effect on Sept. 28. The law limits public officials, journalists and private school teachers to giving or receiving a meal more than 30,000 won (US$26.95), a gift of more than 50,000 won and a congratulatory or condolence payment of more than 100,000 won. Any type of illicit solicitation is prohibited as well.  Industry sources say foreign companies have been preparing heavily for the law, drafting manuals and revising their internal code way ahead of the enactment. “Foreign firms sought legal advice even before the Constitutional Court upheld the new law as constitutional in July,” said Lee Kwang-wook, a lawyer and partner at local law firm Yoon & Yang. These firms, according to the attorney, were in a hurry to prepare because their Korean offices were as vulnerable to the new law as their purely domestic counterparts. “It’s true foreign firms are under strict compliance rules from their home countries, but when it comes to their operations in South Korea, such as sales and PR activities, as well as working with government officials, they are not too different from local companies because they are basically working in a Korean business environment,” he said. According to industry insiders, the automobile, pharmaceutical and financial industries, seemed likely to be most affected due to the new law. No more lavish marketing campaigns To avoid trouble, foreign automakers are cutting down on marketing campaigns. In the past, a new car launching event was usually held at five-star hotels in Seoul, complete with the media and high-profile industry figures. Sumptuous meals and expensive thank you gifts were part of the perks. But under the new law, lavish press conferences are no longer an option. A press conference held on Sept.29 -- a day after the anti-graft law went into effect -- by British supercar Rolls-Royce Motors Cars was one example of how such events will be handled in the future. Neither lunch nor gifts were offered. Although, the company did offer a bus ride to the venue, along with some finger food and soft drinks. Then there’s the issue of test-driving. In the past, automakers allowed reporters to drive their new car for a few days in return for media coverage. These cars were provided with a full gas tank that did not require to be refilled. The expense for offering such cars, however, easily exceeds the limit stipulated in the anti-graft law. But as test-drives are a big part of marketing, carmakers are contemplating how to work around the law. Mercedes-Benz, which is planning on releasing a new model later this year, said it will hold test-driving events complying with the new law.  Crackdown on pharma sector corruption The anti-graft law is also expected to deal a major blow to the pharmaceutical industry that is notorious for offering kickbacks to doctors. Just last month, former and current officials of the Korean unit of Swiss-based Novartis were indicted for paying billions of won as rebates to doctors for prescribing its products. Doctors and workers at major hospitals are now subject to the new law as they are classified as government officials, if they work at a public hospital, and as faculty members, if they work for university hospitals. Law violators can face up to 30 million won fine or imprisonment for a maximum of three years. Foreign pharma firms, such as MSD Korea -- the local affiliate of US-based Merck & Co. -- and the Korean unit of UK-based GlaxoSmithKline, are educating employees to avoid any fallout. “We are communicating with the employees, along with our legal team, to help them avoid any breach of law,” a spokesperson of MSD Korea said. But the situation is not easy, pharma firms said, because some doctors are refusing to meet with their sales representatives altogether. Major university hospitals, such as Seoul National University Hospital and Korea University Hospital, have posted notices throughout their buildings warning the staff about the new law.  Ambiguous interpretation causes confusion in financial sector In finance and banking sectors, firms are on a high alert due to the ambiguous clauses in the anti-graft law. “When the government entrusts funds or delegates authorities to financial institutions, both local and foreign, they become fiduciaries and are subject to the law,” said Yang Ho-seung, managing partner at Yoon & Yang law firm. But the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission -- the state entity in charge of the law -- hasn’t made an authoritative interpretation on the status of bank employees when they perform government services or deal with bureaucrats, causing further chaos. The Korea Federation of Banks -- the association of local and foreign banks in Korea -- is waiting for the commission’s response. In the meantime, the association has asked the banks to limit their activities so that all costs stay under the figures stipulated in the new law. Foreign securities firms that also work closely with government organizations and media outlets have become extremely prudent. “Golf outings with investors and journalists have all been canceled,” according to a senior official at a foreign security firm, who declined to be named. “Brokerage firms and financial institutions acquire government approval for new financial products,” said Lee of Yoon & Yang. “But now these processes may be delayed since bankers are reluctant to contact government officials.” By Ahn Sung-mi (sahn@heraldcorp.com) 영어뉴스를 통한 ListeningㆍReading 실력 향상 단기 학습 프로그램 [NEST] 1.

CNBC senior markets contributor Mike Santoli and &quot;Fast Money&quot; trader Steve Grasso weigh in.</p> Congressmen confirm Mylan overcharged Medicaid    Wednesday, 5 Oct 2016 | 4:05 PM ET | 02:07 Two members of Congress on Wednesday accused big drugmaker Mylan of "bilking taxpayers out of millions of dollars" by underpaying Medicaid in rebates owed on sales of the lifesaving device, as they vowed to recoup that money. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Rep. Frank Pallone, Jr., D-N.J., cited a letter from a top federal health official who confirmed that Mylan had been told "on multiple occasions" that the company was misclassifying EpiPens for the purposes of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. For the past five years, Medicaid has spent nearly $800 million on EpiPens. Under the Medicaid rebate program, Mylan, which has hiked EpiPen prices to more than $600 this year, has been paying a 13 percent rebate on the anti-allergy auto-injector's sales to Medicaid because it classifies EpiPen as a generic device. But it should be paying a brand-name product rate of at least 23.1 percent, as well as an extra rebate because it has hiked the price of the device faster than the rate of inflation, according to the letter from acting Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Andy Slavitt to the Senate Finance Committee ranking member Wyden. Slavitt said EpiPen has patent protection, has no Food and Drug Administration-approved equivalents, and was approved by that agency under a "new drug application," all of which make it a brand-name drug. CMS "has, on multiple occasions, provided guidance to the industry and Mylan on the proper classification of drugs and has expressly told Mylan that the product is incorrectly classified," Slavitt wrote. Slavitt's letter said that while CMS notified drugmakers about the correct classification of their products, "it is the manufacturer's responsibility to report accurate product and pricing data to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program." He added that manufacturers can be fined up to $100,000 per item of false information they submit under the rebate agreement. Mylan bought EpiPen from Merck in 2007. But Slavitt's letter noted that EpiPen, since the fourth quarter of 1997, has been incorrectly reported by its sellers as a generic drug for the rebate program. "This incorrect classification has financial consequences for the amount that federal and state governments spend because it reduces the amount of quarterly rebates Mylan owes for EpiPen," Slavitt wrote. However, he also wrote, "At this time, CMS cannot comment on the total amount of rebates owed by Mylan related to this incorrect classification." But Slavitt's letter also said that total Medicaid spending on EpiPen from 2011 through 2015 was $960 million. That spending had grown annually from $66 million in 2011 to $365 million last year. Mylan paid rebates on slightly less than the $960 million amount, which was reduced because of subtractions for so-called dispensing fee — rebates are not assessed on those fees. "After rebates, net Medicaid spending over this five-year period [on EpiPen] was approximately $797 million, reflecting a rebate of 13 percent," Slavitt wrote. Noting that the actual rebate should have been at least 10 percentage points higher, Wyden and Pallone said, "Today's letter is more evidence that while Mylan irresponsibly raised the price of EpiPen, they were also bilking taxpayers out of millions of dollars." "We will ensure taxpayers gets their due," the congressmen said The company previously said it was relying on guidance from CMS about how it classifies EpiPen for the rebate program. Under that program, drugmakers, in exchange for having their products covered by Medicaid, agree to rebate some of the total sales. The rebates are split between the federal government and the 50 states, which jointly run their Medicaid programs with the federal government. In a statement to CNBC, Mylan reiterated that it was following guidance from the federal government on the classification of EpiPens and it referred to a new government rule that intends to clarify ambiguities in Medicaid rebate law. "The new process calls for the submission of an application for non-innovator status to be submitted to CMS on or before April 1, 2017," Mylan said. "It would be premature to comment further on this issue until the CMS process has concluded." Regarding the CMS letter, "Any changes made to the rebate classification in 1997 pre-dated Mylan's acquisition of the product by almost a decade," the company said. "The longstanding written guidance provided by the federal government is consistent with how the product was classified dates back to the 1997 time frame."

5, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Biological drugs are typically derived from living cells and are used in the prevention and treatment of various diseases such as cancer, blood disorders, auto-immune diseases and other medical conditions. Biological drugs have more complex structures compared to that of conventional drugs. These are highly sensitive and more difficult to characterize and develop. A biological drug typically has around 250 in-process tests during manufacturing compared to around 50 tests for a conventional drug. The increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and growing geriatric population are the major drivers of the global biological drugs market. In addition, various government associations are also supporting the growth of the biological drugs market. Furthermore, advancements in biomedical science hold immense potential for the growth of the biological drugs market. However, high costs of biological drugs and patent expiry of blockbuster drugs impede the growth of the biological drugs market. Moreover, risks of adverse effects associated with biologic injectable drugs are also inhibiting the growth of the biological drugs market. In terms of geography, North America dominates the global biological drugs market. This is due to increasing use of biological drugs for the treatment of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and other chronic diseases. In addition, various government associations are promoting the usage of biological drugs in North America. For instance, in 2012, the American College of Rheumatology – an organization that advances rheumatology through education and research – recommended biologic agents and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. In Europe, the biological drugs market is growing due to increasing aging population in the region. According to a UN report, elderly people accounted for 23.2% of the total population in Germany in 2000, and the number is expected to reach 33.2% by 2025. Aging can lead to certain disorders such as age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma, which require biological drugs for their effective treatment. Low manufacturing costs in Asia attract biopharmaceutical companies to invest in the region. For instance, Lonza – a Switzerland-based biotechnology company – invested around US$ 350 Mn in Singapore and India, in order to encourage biological activities. This report provides in-depth analysis and estimation of the biological drugs market for the period 2014–2020, considering 2014 as the base year for the calculation. In addition, data pertaining to current market dynamics, including market drivers, restraints, trends, and recent developments, has been provided in the report. The global biological drugs market is categorized based on therapeutic protein, monoclonal antibodies (mAb), and vaccines. Based on therapeutic protein, the market segments include Enbrel, Lantus, Neulasta, Avonex, NovoLog, Rebif, Humalog, Aranesp, Epogen, Levemir, Victoza, Betaseron, Neupogen, and Eylea. Based on mAb, the report comprises Humira, Remicade, Rituxan, Avastin, Herceptin, and Lucentis. The vaccine segment is further sub-segmented into Prevnar 13, Gardasil, Fluzone, Varivax, and Cervarix. On the basis of geography, the report identifies and analyzes the market size and predictions for North America, Europe, Asia, and Rest of the World (RoW). Some of the major players in the biological drugs market are Pfizer Inc., Abbott Laboratories, Novartis AG, Eli Lilly and Company, GlaxoSmithKline plc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Merck & Co., Inc., Amgen Inc., Baxter International Inc., and Biogen Idec.
