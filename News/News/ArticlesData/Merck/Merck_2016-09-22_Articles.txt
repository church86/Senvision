New ALK inhibitor Zykadia (ceritinib) was given accelerated approval in the US in 2014 as a treatment for ALK-positive NSCLC patients whose disease had progressed despite prior therapy with Pfizer/Merck KGaA's ALK blocker Xalkori (crizotinib), with EU conditional approval coming through last year. Patients taking Xalkori invariably relapse, often within 12 months of starting treatment with the drug, due to the development of resistance in tumour cells. In the phase III trial, Zykadia extended progression-free survival (PFS) when compared with standard chemotherapy - including maintenance - and also increased the overall response rate as well as the duration of response, according to Novartis. The company says it intends to present the data in full at a future medical congress. "Zykadia has proven to be an important treatment option for ALK+ NSCLC patients who have progressed following treatment with crizotinib," said Novartis head of oncology development and medical affairs, Alessandro Riva. "We are pleased to see these topline results show promise in untreated patients with advanced disease, and look forward to sharing these data with regulatory authorities in the coming months." Zykadia has been growing slowly for Novartis with sales of $48m in the first half of the year. A shift into first-line use would increase the number of patients eligible to receive the drug and allow Novartis to compete head-to-head in the market with Pfizer and co-promotion partner Merck. Analysts believe Zykadia will still face a tough challenge in the market however as it goes in pursuit of Xalkori, which brought in $275m for Pfizer in the first six months of 2016. The reason is that a third ALK inhibitor - Roche's recently-launched second-generation rival Alecensa (alectinib) - seems to be gaining considerable traction in the market. Alecensa sales reached $74m in the first half of the year, suggesting it is making faster headway in the market than Novartis' drug - despite launching several months later - although it does come with a higher price tag. Roche's drug looks set to consolidate its position following the release of data from the Japanese arm of the head-to-head ALEX trial at this year's American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) congress, which found a significant PFS improvement for Alecensa over Xalkori. Full data from the entire cohort is due for publication next year, but the Japanese arm is already leading to speculation that Alecensa has a best-in-class profile that could see it mount a strong challenge to Xalkori. There is still a lot of data to come that could alter the picture however. Clinicians are already discussing among themselves the best order in which to use the drugs - or even use in combination - in order to minimise resistance and extend PFS. Meanwhile, the ALK inhibitors are all being tested in combination with other drugs - including new immuno-oncology agents - and the outcome of those studies could change the picture dramatically.

Women are five to eight times more likely to suffer from thyroid disorders than men[1]. This memorandum of understanding and its resulting policies, which has been signed today, will support women's health and well-being in Jordan, helping women to be more active participants in their local economies.      (Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160922/410987 )  "We are excited about our new partnership with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, which opens new horizons for RHAS to scale up and expand its outreach with a particular focus on women," Hanin Odeh, Director General of RHAS, commented on the signing. "Through this initiative, we are not only helping women look after the health of their children and families better, but more importantly, ensuring that women are looking after their own health. No doubt, if women are not healthy, we are jeopardizing our country's potential on various levels. We are glad that we could benefit from Merck's experience in this area, and adapt scientific and tested approaches, towards a healthier Jordan." The memorandum is part of the global Healthy Women, Healthy Economies initiative, an innovative public-private partnership that explicitly links the issue of women's health and well-being with economic growth. The partnership will focus on developing a thyroid awareness campaign through expanding the Healthy Community Clinic program under RHAS' umbrella. This campaign aims to reach patients, most of whom are women, and health practitioners to promote healthy lifestyles, raise awareness on the importance of diagnosis and treatment of thyroid disease, and it will lay the ground work for further programs addressing other non-communicable diseases that disproportionately affect women. "Advocating for better health, and especially women's health, creates a ripple effect uplifting entire families, communities and future generations. We are proud to partner with RHAS to expand the Healthy Women, Healthy Economies initiative into Jordan. When women do better, communities become stronger and this reflects favourably on economies," said Belén Garijo, Member of the Executive Board and CEO Healthcare at Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. This memorandum is now the second of its kind signed by Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany under the program, following a 2015 partnership with the Philippine Department of Health and Philippine Thyroid Association.

Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany pursues three strategic spheres of corporate responsibility, namely health, environment and culture. Healthy Women, Healthy Economies brings to life Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany's heritage of corporate responsibility and long-term vision to tackle big issues in health, like gender equality in the workforce and access to high-quality health solutions.

Women are five to eight times more likely to suffer from thyroid disorders than men[1]. This memorandum of understanding and its resulting policies, which has been signed today, will support women's health and well-being in Jordan, helping women to be more active participants in their local economies. (Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160922/410985 ) "We are excited about our new partnership with Merck, which opens new horizons for RHAS to scale up and expand its outreach with a particular focus on women," Hanin Odeh, Director General of RHAS, commented on the signing. "Through this initiative, we are not only helping women look after the health of their children and families better, but more importantly, ensuring that women are looking after their own health. No doubt, if women are not healthy, we are jeopardizing our country's potential on various levels. We are glad that we could benefit from Merck's experience in this area, and adapt scientific and tested approaches, towards a healthier Jordan." The memorandum is part of the global Healthy Women, Healthy Economies [http://healthywomen.apec.org ] initiative, an innovative public-private partnership that explicitly links the issue of women's health and well-being with economic growth. The partnership will focus on developing a thyroid awareness campaign through expanding the Healthy Community Clinic program under RHAS' umbrella. This campaign aims to reach patients, most of whom are women, and health practitioners to promote healthy lifestyles, raise awareness on the importance of diagnosis and treatment of thyroid disease, and it will lay the ground work for further programs addressing other non-communicable diseases that disproportionately affect women. "Advocating for better health, and especially women's health, creates a ripple effect, uplifting entire families, communities and future generations. We are proud to partner with RHAS to expand the Healthy Women, Healthy Economies initiative into Jordan. When women do better, communities become stronger and this reflects favourably on economies," said Belén Garijo, Member of the Executive Board and CEO Healthcare at Merck. This memorandum is now the second of its kind signed by Merck under the program, following a 2015 partnership with the Philippine Department of Health and Philippine Thyroid Association. Healthy Women, Healthy Economies is an innovative public-private partnership under the auspices of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation, Merck, and the U.S. and Philippine governments that explicitly links the issue of women's health and well-being with economic growth. Merck pursues three strategic spheres of corporate responsibility, namely health, environment and culture. Healthy Women, Healthy Economies brings to life Merck's heritage of corporate responsibility and long-term vision to tackle big issues in health, like gender equality in the workforce and access to high-quality health solutions. Healthy Women, Healthy Economies brings together the evidence about women's health and well-being and its impact on economic growth with the best practices that governments, employers and non-governmental organizations can follow. It aims to identify and implement policies that advance women's health and well-being to increase their economic participation in the societies they live in.

Construction of the 15,000 m2 facility is expected to be completed by the end of next year, with operations starting by the middle of 2018. The new 'centre of excellence' will have the capacity to package more than 400 million blisters or 150 million packs annually. The main Merck brands to be packaged there will be Glucophage, Concor and Euthyrox to meet increasing patient needs in the areas of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and thyroid disorders. The packaging centre will incorporate energy-saving technologies, which is part of Mercks sustainable strategy for all of its manufacturing plants. 'Sustained growth of healthcare needs in the areas of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and thyroid disorders continues to meet increased patient demand,' said Belén Garijo, Member of the Executive Board of Merck and CEO Healthcare. 'Therefore, we are investing in our manufacturing and supply network across the world to continuously adapt our footprint and capacity while leveraging new technologies to always better serve patients.' An artist's impression of the new packaging centre in Darmstadt.

The cornerstone-laying ceremony was attended by about 100 guests representing local and regional authorities, including the Mayor of the City of Darmstadt, a member from the Regional Administrative Council representing the health authorities, as well as business partners and neighbours.

Salant | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 23, 2016 at 8:35 AM, updated September 23, 2016 at 10:08 AM comments Donald Trump accepts Republican nomination WASHINGTON — Merck & Co. and Lockheed Martin, who each gave $250,000 to the host committee helping to stage the Republican National Convention four years ago, kept their corporate checkbooks closed this time around when the party gathered in Cleveland to nominate Donald Trump. The companies were absent from the list of contributors that gave $67.4 million to the Cleveland host committee, according to Federal Election Commission filings.  David Koch, executive vice president of Koch Industries Inc. of Wichita, who with his brother Charles has spent millions on behalf of Republican candidates and causes, didn't help finance the 2016 convention either after contributing $1 million in 2012.  Also absent from the convention were former Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush; the last two Republican nominees, Arizona Sen. John McCain and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney; and the host governor, Republican John Kasich of Ohio. How Cleveland convention was different Merck, based in Kenilworth, also contributed $450,000 in 2008. Lockheed, which has a major defense facility in Moorestown, gave $150,000 to the 2008 convention host committee. "We have been and will continue to work closely with people on both sides of the aisle to ensure that important policy issues are raised to make health care sustainable over the long term, and we look forward to working with the new administration and the new Congress next year," Merck spokeswoman Lainie Keller said. Lockheed spokesman Bill Phelps declined comment. Even with some corporate defectors, the Cleveland host committee raised more money than four years ago, when $55.9 million was raised to help stage the Tampa convention. Many other donors stayed the course, including AT&T, which gave $4.3 million; Bank of America, $1 million; and Cisco Systems, $2 million. The National Basketball Association champion Cleveland Cavaliers contributed $1 million. Some of the money was given as goods and services rather than in cash. Casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson, who gave $5 million to the Tampa committee, made a $1.5 million contribution this time around. Adelson and his wife spent $90 million on behalf of Republicans in 2012, more than anyone, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based research group. They have not been as generous with their political donations this election season so far. Koch Industries and David Koch, who gave $3.5 million between them, and Adelson, who also contributed $3.5 million, were the biggest contributors to the Republican Governors Association when Gov. Chris Christie served as chairman. Jonathan D. Salant may be reached at jsalant@njadvancemedia.com. Follow him on Twitter @JDSalant. Find NJ.com Politics on Facebook.   Most Read N.J.

Dr Andrew Brooks from the UQ Diamantina Institute was one of three recipients in the Merck Grant for Growth Innovation program for 2016. Dr Brooks said his research sought to develop new treatments for patients with growth disorders and for those who do not respond to appropriate existing drugs. “This $196,000 grant will allow us to build on many years of work to better understand how growth hormone receptors receive signals and transmit them into cells to control how those cells behave,” he said. “Our research in this area has revealed the molecular mechanism of growth hormone signalling and uncovered a new target for therapeutic intervention. “We will use this new information to develop drugs that bypass molecular defects that cause certain types of growth disorders including acromegaly and some growth hormone insensitivity disorders.” Dr Steven Hildemann from Merck’s Biopharma business said it was inspiring to see the high quality and aspiration of the researchers who were awarded grants. “We recognise that despite advances in treatment and management of growth disorders, we still require a better understanding of these diseases to address the high unmet medical need,” Dr Hildemann said. “Identifying and supporting forward thinking researchers in this field of growth follows Merck's scientific strategy of providing a platform that makes innovation possible.” There were 38 applications from 20 countries for this year’s grants, with successful projects chosen by an independent committee of internationally renowned endocrinologists and researchers. The GGI recipients were named during the 55th European Society for Pediatric Endocrinology Meeting in Paris.

The U.S. spends more per capita on healthcare than any other country, yet we have one of the sickest populations. Why is this? And what can we do about it? Big Pharma is spending billions to control the ‘health’care system in the U.S. But do they really care about public health – or their profits? Are we deliberately being kept sick? Who really controls what you read and hear about the ‘health’care system? Does your doctor listen to pharma reps more than patients? How do we stay healthy in a system that wants to keep us sick? Why the huge push for vaccine mandates – is it really for public health – or for profit? This is one of the most pressing issues we face today! If we don’t have our health, what do we really have? It’s now or never. We need to TAKE BACK our health! The hour-long talk will be followed by an interactive Q&A discussion about the state of ‘health’care in the U.S. today. EVENT INFO – WHEN/WHERE: “Is Your Health For $ale?” Sunday, September 25, 2016 at 1 p.m. United Irish Cultural Center 2700 45th Avenue (at Sloat Blvd.) San Francisco, CA FREE street parking. It will also be livestreamed via Facebook for those who cannot attend in person. Visit https://www.facebook.com/brandy.vaughan.98 for the livestream. RSVP at healthforsale2016@yahoo.com and specify number of seats. About Learn The Risk and Brandy Vaughan: Brandy Vaughan is a former pharmaceutical representative for Merck. She advised doctors on the Rx medications her company manufactured. Brandy sold Vioxx, a painkiller that harmed or killed thousands of Americans, and doubled the risk of stroke and heart attacks before it was taken off the market. “From that experience, I realized that just because something is on the market, doesn’t mean it’s safe,” she explains. Brandy left the business horrified and disillusioned at the inner workings and dealings of the industry. As an insider, she knows that Rx’s and vaccines are manufactured without adequate testing, and the huge risks that the public never hears about. She founded LearnTheRisk.org in response. It is a valuable site for information, facts and truth you will never get from media, government agencies, nor most doctors. For unbiased information, facts, statistics and vaccine education from independent sources that are not paid by the pharmaceutical companies whose products they push, visit http://LearnTheRisk.org/ and https://www.facebook.com/LearnTheRisk/. “Learn The Risk” is a campaign produced by the Council for Vaccine Safety, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit.

The U.S. spends more per capita on ‘health’care than any other country, yet we have one of the sickest populations. Why is this? And what can we do about it? Big Pharma is spending billions to control the ‘health’care system in the U.S. But do they really care about public health – or their profits? Are we deliberately being kept sick? Who really controls what you read and hear about the ‘health’care system? Does your doctor listen to pharma reps more than patients? How do we stay healthy in a system that wants to keep us sick? Why the huge push for vaccine mandates – is it really for public health – or for profit? This is one of the most pressing issues we face today: If we don’t have our health, what do we really have? It’s now or never. We need to TAKE BACK our health! The hour-long talk will be followed by an interactive Q&A discussion about the state of ‘health’care in the U.S. today. EVENT INFO – WHEN/WHERE: Sunday, September 25, 2016 at 1 p.m. United Irish Cultural Center 2700 45th Avenue (at Sloat Blvd.) San Francisco, CA FREE street parking. It will also be livestreamed via Facebook for those who cannot attend in person. Visit https://www.facebook.com/brandy.vaughan.98 for the livestream. RSVP at healthforsale2016@yahoo.com and specify number of seats. About LearnTheRisk.org and Brandy Vaughan: Brandy Vaughan is a former pharmaceutical representative for Merck. She advised doctors on the Rx medications her company manufactured. Brandy sold Vioxx, a painkiller that harmed or killed thousands of Americans, and doubled the risk of stroke and heart attacks before it was taken off the market. “From that experience, I realized that just because something is on the market, doesn’t mean it’s safe,” she explains. Brandy left the business horrified and disillusioned at the inner workings and dealings of the industry. As an insider, she knows that Rx’s and vaccines are manufactured without adequate testing, and the huge risks that the public never hears about. She founded LearnTheRisk.org in response. It is a valuable site for information, facts and truth you will never get from media, government agencies, nor most doctors. For unbiased information, facts, statistics and vaccine education from independent sources that are not paid by the pharmaceutical companies whose products they push, visit http://LearnTheRisk.org/ and https://www.facebook.com/LearnTheRisk/. LearnTheRisk.org is a campaign produced by the Council for Vaccine Safety, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. Learn more: http://councilforvaccinesafety.org/.

Merck and the Royal Health Awareness Society Partner to Advance Women's Health in Jordan Merck and the Royal Health Awareness Society Partner to Advance Women's Health in Jordan CHIMICA E FARMACIA Tweet Condividi su WhatsApp Pubblicato il: 22/09/2016 20:12 DARMSTADT, Germany, September 22, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Merck, a leading science and technology company, today announced its partnership with the Royal Health Awareness Society (RHAS) of Jordan to advance health awareness and education particularly on thyroid disease amongst Jordanian women. Women are five to eight times more likely to suffer from thyroid disorders than men[ 1 ]. This memorandum of understanding and its resulting policies, which has been signed today, will support women's health and well-being in Jordan, helping women to be more active participants in their local economies.      (Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160922/410985 ) "We are excited about our new partnership with Merck, which opens new horizons for RHAS to scale up and expand its outreach with a particular focus on women," Hanin Odeh, Director General of RHAS, commented on the signing. "Through this initiative, we are not only helping women look after the health of their children and families better, but more importantly, ensuring that women are looking after their own health. No doubt, if women are not healthy, we are jeopardizing our country's potential on various levels. We are glad that we could benefit from Merck's experience in this area, and adapt scientific and tested approaches, towards a healthier Jordan." The memorandum is part of the global Healthy Women, Healthy Economies initiative, an innovative public-private partnership that explicitly links the issue of women's health and well-being with economic growth. The partnership will focus on developing a thyroid awareness campaign through expanding the Healthy Community Clinic program under RHAS' umbrella. This campaign aims to reach patients, most of whom are women, and health practitioners to promote healthy lifestyles, raise awareness on the importance of diagnosis and treatment of thyroid disease, and it will lay the ground work for further programs addressing other non-communicable diseases that disproportionately affect women. "Advocating for better health, and especially women's health, creates a ripple effect, uplifting entire families, communities and future generations. We are proud to partner with RHAS to expand the Healthy Women, Healthy Economies initiative into Jordan. When women do better, communities become stronger and this reflects favourably on economies," said Belén Garijo, Member of the Executive Board and CEO Healthcare at Merck. This memorandum is now the second of its kind signed by Merck under the program, following a 2015 partnership with the Philippine Department of Health and Philippine Thyroid Association. Healthy Women, Healthy Economies is an innovative public-private partnership under the auspices of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation, Merck, and the U.S. and Philippine governments that explicitly links the issue of women's health and well-being with economic growth. Merck pursues three strategic spheres of corporate responsibility, namely health, environment and culture. Healthy Women, Healthy Economies brings to life Merck's heritage of corporate responsibility and long-term vision to tackle big issues in health, like gender equality in the workforce and access to high-quality health solutions. Healthy Women, Healthy Economies brings together the evidence about women's health and well-being and its impact on economic growth with the best practices that governments, employers and non-governmental organizations can follow. It aims to identify and implement policies that advance women's health and well-being to increase their economic participation in the societies they live in. References  About RHAS  The Royal Health Awareness Society was established in 2005 under the direction of Her Majesty Queen Rania Al-Abdullah to promote health awareness and to empower Jordanians to adopt healthy lifestyles and behaviors. To achieve its mission, RHAS adopts a comprehensive approach, through implementing preventative public health and safety programs based on the right to health for all, targeting school children, youth and the community at large.   All Merck Press Releases are distributed by e-mail at the same time they become available on the Merck Website.

Consumer Confidential With David Lazarus BUSINESS Consumer Confidential Column Recipe for ripoffs: Pricing drugs by their 'value' to sick people The healthcare industry by the numbers How the increasing price of medicine is affecting the healthcare industry How the increasing price of medicine is affecting the healthcare industry David Lazarus Heather Bresch, chief executive of pharmaceutical heavyweight Mylan, testified before lawmakers Wednesday that her company acted ethically and fairly when it jacked up the price of life-saving EpiPens by more than 500%. While saying she was troubled “that the EpiPen product has become a source of controversy,” Bresch told skeptical members of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform that “price and access exist in a balance, and we believe we have struck that balance.” That’s a bold stance considering that each $300 EpiPen contains about a dollar’s worth of epinephrine and Mylan didn’t even invent the plastic injector that delivers the drug. It purchased rights to manufacture and sell EpiPens in 2007 as part of a $6.6-billion acquisition of Merck’s generic-drug operations. At the time of the merger, people were able to buy EpiPens for about $50 each. Mylan now sells EpiPens in packs of two for more than $600. Sick: The biggest increase in healthcare costs in 32 years David Lazarus Healthcare is very much in the news, but for all the wrong reasons. On the one hand, we had Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump visiting the “Dr. Oz” show last week to reveal some tidbits about his physical condition (he’s fat). On the other, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton had a bout... Healthcare is very much in the news, but for all the wrong reasons. On the one hand, we had Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump visiting the “Dr. Oz” show last week to reveal some tidbits about his physical condition (he’s fat). On the other, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton had a bout... (David Lazarus) It’s easy to assume that greed is solely to blame for runaway drug prices — and companies like Mylan do nothing to challenge that perception. The reality, however, is more complicated. When Bresch talked about drug prices and access existing “in a balance,” she was referring to what the pharmaceutical industry calls value-based pricing. This is what you get when you price a drug not just commensurate with its research and development, production and marketing, but also reflecting the drug’s importance to patients. And that’s a very slippery concept. What a pharmaceutical company is basically saying with value-based pricing is that a patient’s life would be a whole lot worse without their drug, so that should be worth something, right? Maybe a big something. “There are a lot of moral and ethical issues that come up when you talk about value-based pricing of drugs,” said Robert L. Stein, a professor of pharmacy law and ethics at Claremont’s Keck Graduate Institute. “Most other consumer products are discretionary or there are alternative sources,” he said. “When you talk about pharmaceuticals, especially newer pharmaceuticals, there aren’t a lot of options.” SIGN UP for the free California Inc. business newsletter » The poster child in this regard is Gilead’s hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, which carried a list price of about $1,000 a pill when it was introduced in 2014. A second-generation version of the drug, Harvoni, cost more than $1,100 a pill. The latest version, Epclusa, sells for closer to $900 a pill. These are astonishing numbers. But Gilead’s drugs effectively cure patients of hepatitis C, so who’s to say they’re not worth every penny? More than 3 million Americans are estimated to have hepatitis C. “We believe the price of Harvoni reflects the value of the medicine,” Gilead said in a 2014 statement defending its pricing. “Unlike long-term or indefinite treatments for other chronic diseases, Harvoni offers a cure at a price that will significantly reduce hepatitis C treatment costs now and deliver significant health care savings to the health care system over the long term.” That’s one way of looking at it. Another is that Gilead justifies its crazy-high prices by arguing that because it would be more expensive to treat hepatitis on an ongoing basis, they can charge whatever they please as long as it’s less than that amount. This is a problem. “Value is one thing, but another consideration is whether society can afford that value,” said Gerard Anderson, a professor of health policy and management at Johns Hopkins University. “If you charge more than people can afford, people die.” If you charge more than people can afford, people die. — Gerard Anderson, professor of health policy and management at Johns Hopkins University He compared lifesaving prescription meds to water. “If a water company charged the value of water, they could charge whatever they like, an infinite amount,” Anderson said. “We couldn’t exist without water. That’s why we don’t allow the water company to charge the value of water.” It’s a tricky business. There’s almost no limit to the value of a drug to someone who’s sick. So with value-based pricing, the door is wide open to abusing patients. At the same time, we’re all better off if drug companies are financially motivated to do the costly research and development necessary to innovate and come up with new cures and treatments. Stein at the Keck Graduate Institute said the only way to deal with the problem might be to approach every drug on a case-by-case basis, rather than imposing price caps across the entire industry. “When is a drug price unconscionable?” he said. “It’s like Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart said about pornography: You know it when you see it.” Jason Doctor, director of health informatics at USC’s Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics, said Mylan’s Bresch crossed that line when she raised the price of EpiPens more than a dozen times since 2008. Allergan CEO is shocked (shocked!) by insane drug prices » “She operated from an oversimplified model that did not account for the value people place on protecting children from harm,” he said. “This is a treasured societal norm.  When the price she set for EpiPens violated that norm, people got angry, even though the price was legal.” Bresch made nearly $19 million last year. She told lawmakers that this was “in the middle” of what drug-industry CEOs make. On the other hand, most other top-tier pharmaceutical CEOs haven’t been subjected to sitting before lawmakers as their company is pilloried for being "sickening," "disgusting" and showing "blatant disrespect" for the needs of families. Bresch seems decidedly overvalued.

Sep 22, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet A leading science and technology company, has announced that the largest delivery of praziquantel tablets ever shipped to Angola recently arrived in Luanda, the capital of country. Angola has received around 4 million tablets for mass distribution to school children. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Angola is one of the most endemic countries for schistosomiasis worldwide. It is estimated that around 26% of the overall population requires treatment. Angola has been participating in the Merck Praziquantel Donation Program since 2008 and has received nearly 12 million tablets to date. “We want to contribute to eliminating the insidious worm disease in order to help infected children to take part in the economic development of their home countries. With our donation of approximately 4 million tablets to WHO for Angola approximately 1.6 million school children can be treated – covering half of the country’s school-aged population in need of treatment. This shows that we are on the right track. However, we know that we alone cannot solve the problem with our tablets,” said Eduardo Carvalho, General Manager of Merck in Angola. As part of its responsibility for society and within Health, one of its corporate responsibility strategic spheres of activity, Merck is supporting WHO in the fight against the worm disease schistosomiasis in Africa. Since 2007, more than 74 million patients, primarily school children, have been treated. To this end, Merck has donated over 340 million praziquantel tablets to WHO. Praziquantel is well tolerated and the most effective treatment to date for schistosomiasis. Merck is also supporting educational and awareness programs in Africa, developing schistosomiasis therapies for very young children and cooperating with partners in the Global Schistosomiasis Alliance.   Do you have more to share about this story - photos or video etc - you can send them to: (newsghana101@gmail.com) TAGS Angola Luanda Merck Praziquantel Donation Program praziquantel Schistosomiasis Tablets World Health Organization SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleE/R: 22 people to appear before court today over Begoro police attacks Next articleAssessing the Buhari administration: Nnamdi Akwada writes News Ghana RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Hajia Samira: Just Like An Amazonian At The War Front Namibia loses 4,000 chickens to Newcastle disease The Need For Peace In Ghana LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply Get more stuff like this in your inbox Subscribe to our mailing list and get interesting stuff and updates to your email inbox. we respect your privacy and take protecting it seriously Recent Posts Akwamu kingdom pledges support for Nana Addo J.

Without knowing a person's genetic variants up to 60 per cent of prescribed medications don't do what they are supposed to do. Adverse drug reactions are both costly and may be dangerous -- something needs to change. To address this situation Dr. Martin Dawes and his multi-disciplinary team of doctors, pharmacists, and epidemiologists at the University of British Columbia, have developed TreatGx, a unique medication decision support system. Using the highest levels of evidence, TreatGX identifies personalized medication options for multiple common conditions. The options are presented to the doctor in an easy-to-read format with helpful information such as dosing instructions, potential adverse reactions, and medication cost comparison. Over the past year, the team has been working to validate this tool and the results were published today in the Canadian Medical Association Journal. There were a 191 patients recruited for the project by physicians and pharmacists. Genotyping was undertaken for each participant, and resulted in 189 (99%) patients with genetic reports linked to the decision-support program. There was at least one actionable genotype in 96.8% of samples. Over a three-month period, physicians and pharmacists used the medication support system 236 times. The outcome of the paper reported that a clinical decision support system with integrated data from pharmacogenetic tests may enable personalized prescribing within primary care. "TreatGX currently includes 24 common conditions such as hypertension, depression, and diabetes," said Dr. Martin Dawes, Head, Department of Family Practice at UBC. "This is a made in BC software system that allows the physician and patient to select tailored drug options for multiple conditions." "There are over 200,000 severe adverse drug events annually in Canada, costing upwards of $14 billion, which places a significant burden on the Canadian healthcare system," explains Dr. Catalina Lopez-Correa, Chief Scientific Officer and VP, Sector Development at Genome BC. "Even if physicians have the pharmacogenetic information, incorporating it into their system is a significant challenge. We are proud to support research that is helping doctors access and streamline genetic information to further enhance patient outcomes." Valued at over $720,000, this novel project was funded through Genome BC's User Partnership Program. It was also supported by The Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research, TELUS Health, the Personalized Medicine Initiative, Roche Canada, AstraZeneca, GSK, Janssen, Merck, Pfizer and Innovative Medicines. For more information on TreatGx visit www.genxys.com/ Glossary of terms: Genotyping: The examination of specific piece of DNA contained in an organism. The genotype, as well as environmental and inherited epigenetic factors, determine the final characteristics. Pharmacogenomics: A branch of pharmacology concerned with using DNA and amino acid sequence data to inform drug development and testing. An important application of pharmacogenomics is correlating individual genetic variation with drug responses. About Genome British Columbia: Genome British Columbia leads genomics innovation on Canada's West Coast and facilitates the integration of genomics into society. A recognized catalyst for government and industry, Genome BC invests in research, entrepreneurship and commercialization in life sciences to address challenges in key sectors such as health, forestry, fisheries, aquaculture, agri-food, energy, mining and environment.

Support girls’ education Against Trumpian triumphalism Guess who’s coming to the White House More Opinion »   The world is a mess, with billions of people locked in inescapable cycles of war, famine and poverty, with more children than ever perishing from hunger, disease and violence: That’s about the only thing Americans agree on; we’re polarized about all else. Several polls have found that about 9 out of 10 Americans believe that global poverty has worsened or stayed the same over the last 20 years. Fortunately, the one point Americans agree on is dead wrong. As world leaders gather for the U.N. General Assembly this week, all the evidence suggests that we are at an inflection point for the ages. The number of people living in extreme poverty ($1.90 per person per day) has tumbled by half in two decades, and the number of small children dying has dropped by a similar proportion — that’s 6 million lives a year saved by vaccines, breast-feeding promotion, pneumonia medicine and diarrhea treatments! Historians may conclude that the most important thing going on in the world in the early 21st century was a stunning decline in human suffering. OK, you’re thinking that I’ve finally cracked up after spending too much time in desperate places. So a few data points: As recently as 1981, when I was finishing college, 44 percent of the world’s population lived in extreme poverty, according to the World Bank. Now the share is believed to be less than 10 percent and falling. “This is the best story in the world today,” says Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank. For the entire history of the human species until the 1960s, a majority of adults were illiterate. Now 85 percent of adults worldwide are literate and the share is rising. Although inequality has risen in America, the global trend is more encouraging: Internationally, inequality is on the decline because of gains by the poor in places like China and India. The U.N. aims to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030, and experts believe it is possible to get quite close. In short, on our watch, we have a decent chance of virtually wiping out ills that have plagued humanity for thousands of generations, from illiteracy to the most devastating kind of hand-to-mouth poverty. Yet the public thinks the opposite, that poverty is getting worse. A poll to be released Thursday by Motivaction, a Dutch firm, finds that only 1 percent of Americans surveyed realized that global extreme poverty had fallen by half over 20 years. I wonder if those of us in journalism and the humanitarian worlds don’t err by focusing so much on human misery that we leave the public with the misperception that everything is always getting worse. I’ve covered massacres in South Sudan, concentration camps in Myanmar and widespread stunting in India, but it’s also important to acknowledge the backdrop of global progress. Otherwise, the public may perceive poverty as hopeless and see no point in carrying on the fight — at just the point when we’re making the most rapid gains ever recorded. When I first made the acquaintance of the developing world, as a backpacking law student in the 1980s — sometimes riding on tops of trains or buses and writing articles to pay my expenses — the most gut-wrenching aspect of poverty I encountered was ubiquitous blind beggars, robbed of dignity and any chance to be productive. This is much less common today, partly because humanitarian aid — despite real shortcomings — has made a profound difference in health. The heroic work of former President Jimmy Carter and pharmaceutical donations from Merck have made river blindness less common. Vitamin A capsules costing 2 cents a dose have reduced blindness as well. Antibiotics have helped curb blinding trachoma. And a simple $25 surgery developed by a Nepali ophthalmologist, Dr. Sanduk Ruit, lets people suffering from cataracts see again. The scenes of blind beggars on every street corner will soon be gone forever. Cynics scoff that if more children’s lives are saved, they will just grow up to have more babies and cause new famines and cycles of poverty. Not so! In fact, when parents are assured that their children will survive, they choose to have fewer of them. As girls are educated and contraception becomes available, birthrates tumble — just as they did in the West. Indian women now average just 2.4 births, Indonesian women 2.5, and Mexican women just 2.2. So in a moment we can return to urgent needs worldwide, from war to climate change to refugees. But first, let’s pause for a nanosecond of silence to acknowledge the greatest gains in human well-being in the history of our species — not to inspire complacency, but rather to spur our efforts to accelerate what may be the most important trend in the world today.

Indian women now average just 2.4 births, Indonesian women 2.5, and Mexican women just 2.2. So in a moment we can return to urgent needs worldwide, from war to climate change to refugees. But first, let’s pause for a nanosecond of silence to acknowledge the greatest gains in human well-being in the history of our species — not to inspire complacency, but rather to spur our efforts to accelerate what may be the most important trend in the world today. ■ Nicholas Kristof grew up on a sheep and cherry farm in Yamhill.

2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The global alzheimer's therapeutics market is expected to reach USD 6.4 billion in 2024, according to a new report by Grand View Research. Some primary factors driving the market growth includes rising government initiatives in order to raise awareness levels among people. Growing knowledge about the Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its high prevalence and incidence in developing economies are few of the major drivers supporting the market growth. Several governments, nonprofit, and private organizations worldwide are actively engaged in increasing people's awareness regarding progressive AD, such as Alzheimer's Association, the Alzheimer's Society of Canada, Alzheimer's Europe organization, and various other small organizations. Furthermore, the increased government funding for providing better care and support to the people with partial dementia is another important factor anticipated to enlarge market growth. For instance, organizations like Florida Department of Health, the National Institute of Health, and Alzheimer's Association in partnership with other private and government organizations provide funds to the research centers. The presence of various pipeline drugs is anticipated to provide the market with potential growth opportunities. For instance, LMTX by TauRx Pharmaceutical Ltd.; idalopirdine (Lu AE58054) by Lundbeck; crenezumab by AC Immune SA; and BAN2401 by Eisai Moreover, novel therapeutics with minimal dosage requirement has been introduced resulting in cost-effective alternatives, which is further expected to boost the market growth.

Patent expiry of key drugs such as Aricept, Exelon, and Razadyne was the major factor for decline in market share. Exelon transdermal patch is estimated to lose exclusivity in 2019. It is a highly prescribed drug for the treatment of mild to moderate AD, which contributed toward its revenue generation in 2015. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, on the other hand, is expected to witness a significant growth of around 16.0% over the forecast period owing to introduction of extended relase formulation of Namenda. Other drug therapies such as monocloclonal antibodies and drugs targeting Tau proteins are in being studied in latter phases of the clinical trials. Presence of a strong of pipeline drugs for target disease are attributing toward fastest growth of these drugs North America dominated the overall market in terms of revenue with share of over 33.0% in 2015, which is majorly facilitated by the availability of sophisticated healthcare facilities and infrastructure. Some key players operating in this industry are Pfizer, Inc.; Merck & Co. Inc.; Novartis AG; Eisai Co. Ltd., H. Lundbeck A/S, AC Immune; TauRx Pharmaceuticals Ltd.; Actavis plc.; Forest Laboratories; and Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd.

Jerome Delay AP i NICHOLAS KRISTOF New York Times LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story The world is a mess, with billions of people locked in inescapable cycles of war, famine and poverty, with more children than ever perishing from hunger, disease and violence. That’s about the only thing Americans agree on; we’re polarized about all else. But several polls have found that about 9 out of 10 Americans believe that global poverty has worsened or stayed the same over the past 20 years. Fortunately, the one point Americans agree on is dead wrong. __________ While you were sleeping … world poverty was slashed Sen. Tim Scott: It’s time to stop talking about poverty -- and listen __________ As world leaders gather for the U.N. General Assembly this week, all the evidence suggests that we are at an inflection point for the ages. The number of people living in extreme poverty ($1.90 per person per day) has tumbled by half in two decades, and the number of small children dying has dropped by a similar proportion. That’s 6 million lives a year saved by vaccines, breast-feeding promotion, pneumonia medicine and diarrhea treatments. Historians may conclude that the most important thing going on in the world in the early 21st century was a stunning decline in human suffering. OK, you’re thinking I’ve finally cracked up after spending too much time in desperate places. So a few data points: ▪ As recently as 1981, 44 percent of the world’s population lived in extreme poverty. Now the share is believed to be less than 10 percent and falling. “This is the best story in the world today,” says Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank. ▪ For the entire history of the human species until the 1960s, a majority of adults were illiterate. Now 85 percent of adults worldwide are literate, and the share is rising. ▪ Although inequality has risen in America, inequality is on the decline internationally because of gains by the poor in places like China and India. We have a decent chance of virtually wiping out ills that have plagued humanity for thousands of generations, from illiteracy to the most devastating kind of hand-to-mouth poverty. The U.N. aims to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030, and experts believe it is possible to get quite close. In short, on our watch, we have a decent chance of virtually wiping out ills that have plagued humanity for thousands of generations, from illiteracy to the most devastating kind of hand-to-mouth poverty. Yet the public thinks the opposite, that poverty is getting worse. A poll released Thursday by Motivaction, a Dutch company, finds that only 1 percent of Americans surveyed realized that global extreme poverty had fallen by half over 20 years. I wonder if those of us in journalism and the humanitarian worlds don’t err by focusing so much on human misery that we leave the public with the misperception that everything is always getting worse. I’ve covered massacres in South Sudan, concentration camps in Myanmar and widespread stunting in India, but it’s also important to acknowledge the backdrop of global progress. Otherwise, the public may perceive poverty as hopeless and see no point in carrying on the fight — at just the point when we’re making the most rapid gains ever recorded. When I first made the acquaintance of the developing world, as a backpacking law student in the 1980s, the most gut-wrenching aspect of poverty I encountered was ubiquitous blind beggars, robbed of dignity and any chance to be productive. The scenes of blind beggars on every street corner will soon be gone forever. This is much less common today, partly because humanitarian aid — despite real shortcomings — has made a profound difference in health. The heroic work of former President Jimmy Carter and pharmaceutical donations from Merck have made river blindness less common. Vitamin A capsules costing 2 cents a dose have reduced blindness as well. Antibiotics have helped curb blinding trachoma. And a simple $25 surgery developed by a Nepali ophthalmologist, Dr. Sanduk Ruit, lets people suffering from cataracts see again. The scenes of blind beggars on every street corner will soon be gone forever. Cynics scoff that if more children’s lives are saved, they will just grow up to have more babies and cause new famines and cycles of poverty. Not so. In fact, when parents are assured that their children will survive, they choose to have fewer of them. As girls are educated and contraception becomes available, birthrates tumble — just as they did in the West. Indian women now average just 2.4 births, Indonesian women 2.5, and Mexican women just 2.2. So in a moment we can return to urgent needs worldwide, from war to climate change to refugees. But first, let’s pause for a nanosecond of silence to acknowledge the greatest gains in human well-being in the history of our species — not to inspire complacency, but rather to spur our efforts to accelerate what may be the most important trend in the world today.

The licensed therapeutic programs include Ligand's aplindore program for the treatment of various CNS disorders, a CRTH2 antagonist program for the treatment of respiratory disorders, a Captisol-enabled™ acetaminophen program for pain and fever management and an H3 receptor antagonist program for the treatment of narcolepsy. Under the license agreement, Ligand is entitled to receive initial payments in equity or cash of $1.3 million upon Seelos’ completing a minimum of $7.5 million financing and up to an additional $3.5 million if Seelos becomes a public company and up to $145 million of additional cash milestones. In addition, Ligand is entitled to net sales royalties ranging from 4% to 10% for the various programs licensed. Ligand has also entered into a supply agreement for Captisol. If certain conditions are met, Ligand will provide a three-year convertible loan facility to Seelos in an amount up to $500,000. Seelos is responsible for all development activities under the license. "Seelos is assembling a great team of industry veterans to focus on a promising portfolio of mid- and late-stage programs. We are impressed with their development plans and with the outlook for building their business," said John Higgins, CEO of Ligand Pharmaceuticals. "Ligand has a track record of success with licensing foundational assets at the early stage of company formation, such as with Retrophin, Sage and Viking. All were private companies at the time of the Ligand license and all subsequently became public off lead programs licensed from Ligand. We are eager to watch Seelos progress." "We are pleased to announce the collaboration for a portfolio of CNS products with our partner Ligand Pharmaceuticals," said Dr. Raj Mehra, Chairman, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Seelos Therapeutics, Inc. "This partnership highlights Seelos' focus on developing late-stage CNS product candidates with proven mechanism of action. SLS-006, one of the lead assets acquired in this agreement, is a Phase-3 ready and clinically-validated partial dopamine agonist that is well-positioned to advance in development with a goal to provide relief to an estimated 1.5 million Parkinson's disease patients in the developed world." About Seelos Therapeutics, Inc. Seelos Therapeutics, Inc. is an emerging CNS company with late-stage clinical assets focused on neurological and psychiatric disorders, including orphan diseases. One of Seelos’ lead clinical product candidates, SLS-006 (formerly known as aplindore), is a Phase 3-ready, first-in-class, small molecule, partial dopamine agonist that has shown remarkable efficacy in early stage Parkinson's disease as a monotherapy. SLS-006 has also shown potent activity as an adjunctive therapy to highly reduced dosages of L-Dopa in late-stage Parkinson's disease. SLS-006 has been tested in more than 340 patients and has exhibited impressive efficacy similar to L-Dopa and an attractive safety profile. Seelos’ other Phase-3 ready product candidates, SLS-002 and SLS-004, have also been tested in clinical trials in more than 500 patients each and have shown promising efficacy. Seelos’ mission is to apply its clinical expertise to develop novel therapeutics to address unmet medical needs for the benefit of patients with psychiatric and movement disorders.

Credit Tobin Jones/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The world is a mess, with billions of people locked in inescapable cycles of war, famine and poverty, with more children than ever perishing from hunger, disease and violence. That’s about the only thing Americans agree on; we’re polarized about all else. But several polls have found that about 9 out of 10 Americans believe that global poverty has worsened or stayed the same over the last 20 years. Fortunately, the one point Americans agree on is dead wrong. As world leaders gather for the United Nations General Assembly this week, all the evidence suggests that we are at an inflection point for the ages. The number of people living in extreme poverty ($1.90 per person per day) has tumbled by half in two decades, and the number of small children dying has dropped by a similar proportion — that’s six million lives a year saved by vaccines, breast-feeding promotion, pneumonia medicine and diarrhea treatments! Historians may conclude that the most important thing going on in the world in the early 21st century was a stunning decline in human suffering. Photo A crowded train in Mumbai, India. Credit Rajanish Kakade/Associated Press O.K., you’re thinking that I’ve finally cracked up after spending too much time in desperate places. So a few data points: ■ As recently as 1981, when I was finishing college, 44 percent of the world’s population lived in extreme poverty, according to the World Bank. Now the share is believed to be less than 10 percent and falling. “This is the best story in the world today,” says Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank. ■ For the entire history of the human species until the 1960s, a majority of adults were illiterate. Now 85 percent of adults worldwide are literate and the share is rising. Advertisement Continue reading the main story ■ Although inequality has risen in America, the global trend is more encouraging: Internationally, inequality is on the decline because of gains by the poor in places like China and India. The U.N. aims to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030, and experts believe it is possible to get quite close. In short, on our watch, we have a decent chance of virtually wiping out ills that have plagued humanity for thousands of generations, from illiteracy to the most devastating kind of hand-to-mouth poverty. Yet the public thinks the opposite, that poverty is getting worse. A poll to be released Thursday by Motivaction, a Dutch firm, finds that only 1 percent of Americans surveyed realized that global extreme poverty had fallen by half over 20 years.

Privacy Policy I wonder if those of us in journalism and the humanitarian worlds don’t err by focusing so much on human misery that we leave the public with the misperception that everything is always getting worse. I’ve covered massacres in South Sudan, concentration camps in Myanmar and widespread stunting in India, but it’s also important to acknowledge the backdrop of global progress. Otherwise, the public may perceive poverty as hopeless and see no point in carrying on the fight — at just the point when we’re making the most rapid gains ever recorded. When I first made the acquaintance of the developing world, as a backpacking law student in the 1980s, sometimes riding on tops of trains or buses and writing articles to pay my expenses, the most gut-wrenching aspect of poverty I encountered was ubiquitous blind beggars, robbed of dignity and any chance to be productive. This is much less common today, partly because humanitarian aid — despite real shortcomings — has made a profound difference in health. The heroic work of former President Jimmy Carter and pharmaceutical donations from Merck have made river blindness less common. Vitamin A capsules costing 2 cents a dose have reduced blindness as well. Antibiotics have helped curb blinding trachoma. And a simple $25 surgery developed by a Nepali ophthalmologist, Dr. Sanduk Ruit, lets people suffering from cataracts see again. The scenes of blind beggars on every street corner will soon be gone forever. Cynics scoff that if more children’s lives are saved, they will just grow up to have more babies and cause new famines and cycles of poverty. Not so! In fact, when parents are assured that their children will survive, they choose to have fewer of them. As girls are educated and contraception becomes available, birthrates tumble — just as they did in the West. Indian women now average just 2.4 births, Indonesian women 2.5, and Mexican women just 2.2. So in a moment we can return to urgent needs worldwide, from war to climate change to refugees. But first, let’s pause for a nanosecond of silence to acknowledge the greatest gains in human well-being in the history of our species — not to inspire complacency, but rather to spur our efforts to accelerate what may be the most important trend in the world today.

Note that the study suggests that concerns about differential infection risks may not need to influence physician choice between mycophenolate versus azathioprine and mycophenolate versus cyclophosphamide. Rates of serious infection and mortality among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) did not depend on the immunosuppressive drug regimen they were on, investigators reported. In a study of propensity score-matched pairs of patients, rates of serious infection and mortality didn't change whether SLE patients were new users of mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept), azathioprine, or cyclophosphamide, wrote Candace H. Feldman, MD, MPH, of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, and colleagues, in Arthritis & Rheumatology. It's well known that patients with SLE face an increased risk of developing serious infections that could lead to hospitalizations and even death. But uncertainty exists as to whether infection rates differ according to the various immunosuppressive drug regimens SLE patients undergo, Feldman's groups pointed out. The authors used insurance claims data from the Medicaid Analytic eXtract database for Medicaid enrollees to assess whether there were differences in the rates of serious infection among SLE patient initiating mycophenolate (CellCept) compared with azathioprine, as well as those initiating mycophenolate compared with cyclophosphamide. These agents were selected for study because they are the most commonly used medications for treating moderate-to-severe SLE (other than hydroxychloroquine and corticosteroids) and are often used interchangeably. Feldman and her colleagues studied 1,350 propensity score-matched pairs of patients in whom mycophenolate and azathioprine treatments had been newly initiated, as well as 674 pairs of mycophenolate and cyclophosphamide patients. They estimated propensity scores for the patients receiving mycophenolate versus those receiving azathioprine, as well as those receiving mycophenolate versus cyclophosphamide, based on sociodemographic, comorbidity, and medication use information. For both drug comparisons, they determined rates of first serious infection as well as all-cause mortality over 6- and 12-month periods. First serious infection was defined as a hospital discharge diagnosis ICD-9 code for bacterial infection, as well as fungal, viral, and mycobacterial infections. For the mycophenolate/azathioprine comparison, the 6-month intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis determined that the incident rate of first hospitalized infection per 100 person-years was 14.6 (95% CI 11.6-17.6) among mycophenolate new users and 15.2 (95% CI 12.9-18.3) among azathioprine new users. More than 90% of the infections in both treatment groups were bacterial and there was no significant difference in time to infection. Additionally, there was no significant difference in infection rates in the 12-month ITT analysis. As for the mycophenolate/cyclophosphamide group, a 6-month ITT analysis comparing the two found that the incident rates of first hospitalized infection per 100 person-years were 24.1 (95% CI 18.6-29.7) among new mycophenolate users and 24.6 (95% CI 19.0-30.2) among new cyclophosphamide users. As with the mycophenolate/azathioprine comparison group, over 90% of infections were bacterial, and there were no significant differences in infection rates in the 12-month ITT analysis. While the researchers observed no differences in serious infection rates based on their analyses, "we found high rates of serious infections associated with use of all three of the immunosuppressive medications examined." Therefore, they suggested that "the high burden of serious infections among SLE patients receiving these medications overall is important to consider." This study has the potential to help physicians guide clinical decisions concerning these three drugs, Feldman's group concluded, adding that their findings suggest that "concerns about differential infection risks may not need to influence physician and patient choice between mycophenolate versus azathioprine and mycophenolate versus cyclophosphamide, even in a population highly susceptible to adverse outcomes." While the study was the largest head-to-head population-based comparative effectiveness study examining this subject, the authors wrote, "it lacks power to examine specific infection subtypes, as well as the effect of immunosuppressive dosages on these rates." They also pointed out that while the study compared risk of infection in the short term, further study is needed to analyze the risk associated with long-term use of these medications. The study was funded by the Lupus Foundation and the NIH. Feldman disclosed funding from the Rheumatology Research Foundation Investigator Award. She disclosed relevant relationships with Pfizer and Merck/EMD Serono. Co-authors disclosed relevant relationships with Pfizer, Merck, Amgen, Bayer, Keryx, Medtronic, Mitsubishi-Tanabe, Rockwell, Aetion, PCORI, and ACUMEN.
