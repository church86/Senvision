Merck anticipates making ZINPLAVA available in first quarter 2017. ZINPLAVA is indicated to reduce recurrence of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in patients 18 years of age or older who are receiving antibacterial drug treatment of CDI and are at high risk for CDI recurrence. ZINPLAVA is not indicated for the treatment of CDI. ZINPLAVA is not an antibacterial drug. ZINPLAVA should only be used in conjunction with antibacterial drug treatment of CDI. CDI is caused by bacteria that produce toxins, including toxin B. Symptoms of CDI include mild-to-severe diarrhea, abdominal pain and fever. The incidence of recurrent CDI is higher in certain patient populations, including people 65 years of age or older and those with compromised immune systems. “For generations, Merck has been steadfast in its commitment to fighting infectious diseases – and that commitment continues today. ZINPLAVA is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to C. difficile toxin B and neutralizes its effects,” said Dr. Nicholas Kartsonis, vice president of clinical development, infectious diseases, Merck Research Laboratories. Selected safety information about ZINPLAVA Heart failure was reported more commonly in the two Phase 3 clinical trials in ZINPLAVA-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. These adverse reactions occurred primarily in patients with underlying congestive heart failure (CHF). In patients with a history of CHF, 12.7% (15/118) of ZINPLAVA-treated patients and 4.8% (5/104) of placebo-treated patients had the serious adverse reaction of heart failure during the 12-week study period. Additionally, in patients with a history of CHF, there were more deaths in ZINPLAVA-treated patients [19.5% (23/118)] than in placebo-treated patients [12.5% (13/104)] during the 12-week study period. The causes of death varied, and included cardiac failure, infections, and respiratory failure. In patients with a history of CHF, ZINPLAVA (bezlotoxumab) should be reserved for use when the benefit outweighs the risk. The most common adverse reactions occurring within 4 weeks of infusion with a frequency greater than placebo and reported in greater-than or equal to 4% of patients treated with ZINPLAVA and Standard of Care (SoC) antibacterial drug therapy vs placebo and SoC antibacterial drug therapy included nausea (7% vs 5%), pyrexia (5% vs 3%) and headache (4% vs 3%). Serious adverse reactions occurring within 12 weeks following infusion were reported in 29% of ZINPLAVA-treated patients and 33% of placebo-treated patients. Heart failure was reported as a serious adverse reaction in 2.3% of ZINPLAVA-treated patients and 1.0% of placebo-treated patients. In ZINPLAVA-treated patients, 10% experienced one or more infusion specific adverse reactions compared to 8% of placebo-treated patients, on the day of or the day after, the infusion. Infusion specific adverse reactions reported in greater-than or equal to 0.5% of patients receiving ZINPLAVA and at a frequency greater than placebo were nausea (3%), fatigue (1%), pyrexia (1%), dizziness (1%), headache (2%), dyspnea (1%) and hypertension (1%). Of these patients, 78% experienced mild adverse reactions, and 20% of patients experienced moderate adverse reactions. These reactions resolved within 24 hours following onset. As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity following administration of ZINPLAVA. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to bezlotoxumab in two Phase 3 studies with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. Following treatment with ZINPLAVA in these two studies, none of the 710 evaluable patients tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-bezlotoxumab antibodies. About bezlotoxumab Bezlotoxumab was developed by researchers at the University of Massachusetts Medical School’s MassBiologics Laboratory in conjunction with Medarex (now part of Bristol-Myers Squibb), and was licensed to Merck in 2009.

The company said the Keytruda was superior compared to investigator choice chemotherapy. Based on a pre-specified interim analysis, an independent Data Monitoring Committee has recommended that the trial be stopped early. The safety profile of Keytruda was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies involving patients with advanced urothelial cancer. According to Merck, the Keytruda clinical development program includes more than 30 tumor types in more than 360 clinical trials, including nearly 200 trials that combine Keytruda with other cancer treatments. Keynote -045 is a randomized, pivotal, phase 3 study evaluating as a monotherapy compared to investigator-choice chemotherapy.

The CDC previously recommended three doses of Gardasil, which is the only vaccine in the United States that is currently licensed to prevent the human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV can cause some cancers such as cervical cancer, throat cancer, and mouth cancer. Government officials say that the change came after studies showed that two doses protected recipients for “decades,” NBC News reports. They said that earlier studies had only been performed on children who received three doses of the vaccine, so researchers had not realized that two vaccinations might be sufficient. They also reported that they found that the vaccine was at least as effective in preventing HPV if the doses were a year apart, and perhaps even more effective. Previous recommendations had been that children should receive the second shot one to two months after the first, and the third shot six months after that. The two original HPV vaccines offered in the United States protected against either two or four of the strains of HPV that have been linked to some cancers. Now the only vaccine available in the U.S. is Merck’s Gardasil 9, which claims to protect against nine strains of HPV. Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC, said that researchers still don’t know how many doses of older HPV vaccines are needed, so they are still recommending three doses for kids who were vaccinated with earlier versions of the HPV vaccine. There are over 100 strains of HPV, according to Web MD. About 40 of these strains are sexually transmitted, and about half of all sexually active people will contract at least one strain. Symptoms are typically mild if they are experienced at all, and HPV tends to go away on its own. Some strains of HPV can cause genital warts. These strains are considered “low risk” strains and rarely develop into cancer. The most common of these strains is now included in Gardasil 9. HPV typically clears up on its own. In fact, research has shown that 90 percent of women who contract HPV will show no traces of infection within two years. The CDC recommends that all preteen girls and boys receive the Gardasil vaccine starting at age 11 or 12. One reason is that this is before teens are sexually active. They also recommend vaccination at an earlier age because older teens are less likely to get health checkups than preteens. Despite the CDC recommendations, many Americans continue to have reservations about the HPV vaccine. Merck, maker of MMR and HPV (Gardasil) vaccines has paid over $6 Billion for damage done by Vioxx. #VaxWithMe https://t.co/alKI535npr — Zoey O'Toole (@TMRProf) October 10, 2016 Gardasil Researcher Speaks Out on Dangers of HPV Vaccine #VaccinesKill #CDCWhistlleblower #Vaxxed #CDCFraud https://t.co/UXtiigbpp3 — Richard Healy (@RichardJHealy) October 21, 2016 Clinicians becoming reluctant to recommend HPV vaccine due to reports of serious adverse reactions https://t.co/fmSpYCSAN3 — CMSRI (@CMSRIResearch) October 21, 2016 Some have responded to the new Gardasil recommendation with cynicism, noting that most teens were not getting three doses of the HPV vaccine anyway and pointing out the high cost and health concerns that have been linked to the controversial vaccine. A 2015 study reported in the British Medical Journal found that two doses of HPV vaccination were “likely” to protect against HPV infection for at least 10 years. Researchers determined that three doses probably provided longer protection, but they did not know if it was worth the higher government cost, writing that the risk-benefit ratio was probably best for governments if only two doses were given since the vaccine is so costly for government health programs. Researchers noted that even the WHO has switched to recommending only two doses of the HPV vaccine because of the costs. “The World Health Organization’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) also recommended a two dose schedule for girls aged 9-14 years after reviewing evidence including cost effectiveness modelling.” Gardasil was first approved in the United States in 2006, though it was not approved for boys and young men until 2009. The Atlantic reports that Gardasil is Merck’s top selling vaccine, bringing in $1.4 billion in annual sales.

HPV vaccines Pre-teens need only two HPV shots, not three, CDC recommends Cervarix vaccine is highly effective at protecting against the two most common cervical cancer causing HPV types. Photo: Golinharris Two doses of a vaccine that protects against cervical and several other types of cancer are enough for 11-to 12-year-olds, rather than the previous three-shot regimen, the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday. Vaccines against the human papillomavirus, or HPV, Merck & Co Inc's Gardasil and GlaxoSmithKline Plc's Cervarix, have been available for years, but acceptance by the public has been slow. "Safe, effective, and long-lasting protection against HPV cancers with two visits instead of three means more Americans will be protected from cancer," CDC Director Tom Frieden said in a statement. "This recommendation will make it simpler for parents to get their children protected in time." The CDC now recommends that 11- to 12-year-olds receive two doses of HPV vaccine at least six months apart. Adolescents aged 13 and 14 can also receive the two-dose schedule, but teens and young adults who start the series later, at ages 15 through 26 years, will continue to need three doses, the agency said. HPV is among the most common sexually transmitted diseases. Most infections do not cause symptoms and go away on their own, but the virus is still a leading cause of cancer deaths among women worldwide. Since the virus can also cause genital warts and cancers of the anus and mouth/throat, the vaccine is recommended for both sexes. In the United States, the HPV vaccine is recommended for children aged 11 or 12, with the goal of protecting them against the virus before they become sexually active, and also for teens and young adults who may not have previously been vaccinated.

Secondhand smoke linked to higher risk of stroke The increased risk of stroke that comes with smoking may extend to nonsmokers who live in the same household and breathe in secondhand smoke, a U.S. study suggests. Researchers found that never-smokers who had a stroke were nearly 50 percent more likely to be exposed to secondhand smoke at home than people who had never had a stroke. Sanders urges Californians to approve drug price ballot measure Former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, in an opinion editorial published in the Los Angeles Times, on Friday urged Californians to approve a November ballot measure aimed at reining in pharmaceutical prices. The California Drug Price Relief Act, also known as Proposition 61, seeks to limit state health programs from paying more for medications than the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which receives the steepest discounts in the country. Climate change is shifting areas of skin disease concern Climate change is bringing certain skin diseases and other illnesses to regions where they were rarely seen before, according to a recent research review. Dermatologists should keep these changing patterns of skin diseases in mind when making diagnoses, say the authors, who analyzed specific disease shifts in North America. Cigna ends preauthorization requirement to treat opioid addiction Health insurer Cigna Corp has discontinued its policy of requiring doctors to seek authorization before treating opioid addicts, as part of a fight against an epidemic of opioid abuse, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said on Friday. The policy change will apply nationally, said Schneiderman, who has been pushing for easier access to treatments for an estimated 2.2 million American addicts. Polio vaccine makers failing to make enough doses: WHO experts Two companies making vaccines to help the world eradicate polio are failing to produce enough, so many countries should prepare to give lower doses to make stocks last, a group of experts has advised the World Health Organization. With polio on the brink of eradication globally, the WHO wants to see a worldwide switch from the traditional "live" oral polio vaccine, which runs the risk of spreading the disease, to an inactivated vaccine that needs to be injected. Rehab after heart attack tied to longer, not healthier life Heart attack survivors who participate in cardiac rehabilitation programs may survive longer, but feel no healthier, than they would without this follow-up care, a U.S. study suggests. Previous research has linked medically supervised rehab programs focused on things like stress reduction, exercise and heart healthy living to lower mortality rates. The current study offered more evidence of this: rehab participants were 41 percent less likely to die of all causes during up to seven years of follow-up. Indian doctor accused of crimes becomes president of World Medical Association The World Medical Association (WMA), the top medical-ethics body, on Friday installed an Indian doctor facing corruption charges as its president, despite controversy surrounding his appointment while legal cases are pending. A statement released by the WMA said Dr. Ketan Desai delivered his inaugural speech as president on Friday at the association's annual assembly in Taiwan. He will serve in the position for 2016/17. Merck's Keytruda succeeds in key bladder cancer trial Merck & Co Inc said its immunotherapy, Keytruda, helped previously treated patients with advanced bladder cancer live longer in a late-stage study, prompting an independent monitoring panel to recommend stopping the trial early. The blockbuster drug's benefit in patients with urothelial cancer, the most common form of bladder cancer, surpassed that of chemotherapy, meeting the main study goal of overall survival. Docs lay out media recommendations for kids, teens The quantity and quality of media children and teens consume should change with their age, according to new guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics. The organization also says parents should oversee children's media consumption and educate them about proper media engagement. Type 1 diabetes often comes with other autoimmune diseases People with type 1 diabetes often develop other autoimmune disorders, such as thyroid and gastrointestinal diseases, and a recent study yields new information about this link. In type 1 diabetes, the immune system attacks the pancreas and destroys its insulin-producing cells. Patients often develop other immune system diseases, too. Indeed, in the current study, 27 percent of patients had at least one other autoimmune disorder. Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Meet the Contributors → Bio Roundup: Jenkins Gets Mad, Bernie Gets His Pen, CRISPR IPO & J-Lo Alex Lash October 21st, 2016 @alexlash @xconomy Like Us Xconomy National —  If you’re among those frustrated by the lack of talk about health and science in the three presidential debates, this week perhaps brought you a wee consolation prize. The steady drip of hacked Hillary Clinton-related emails showed her campaign team questioning then-candidate FDA commissioner Robert Califf’s ties to the pharma industry. The staff also crowed over Clinton’s tweet—a reaction last summer to the first revelations about Martin Shkreli’s price gouging—that sent biopharma stocks downhill. Bernie Sanders is no longer a presidential candidate, but he continued his pharma-bashin’ ways with a letter to Ariad Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ARIA) questioning the firm’s price hikes for cancer drug ponatinib (Iclusig). The hikes were first reported earlier this month by Adam Feuerstein of The Street. If politicians flogging drug makers doesn’t slake your thirst for health and science in the national conversation, how about J-Lo taking on DNA-disrupting baddies on a TV show called C.R.I.S.P.R.? No word yet if—ahem—Gene Hackman will co-star. You think that’s funny? Wait til you get a load of this week’s roundup. TOP STORIES —The hepatitis C drug telaprevir (Incivek) from Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) was once the fastest drug launch in history before competition wiped it off the map in three years. In a feature this week, Vertex CEO Jeff Leiden said the collapse was a result of “hubris” and “blindness.” Xconomy detailed the drug’s rise and fall, and the steps Vertex is taking to prevent its new dominant cystic fibrosis business from suffering the same fate. —Xconomy reported Monday that Tom Daniel, Celgene’s (NASDAQ: CELG) former president of research and early development, left the Summit, NJ, company over the summer to start Catalysis Advisors in San Diego. For the past decade, Daniel and Celgene executive vice president George Golumbeski formed one of the best-known deal-making duos in biopharma. —A team led by gene therapy researcher Jennifer Adair at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center has refashioned a common blood-spinning medical device into an automated tabletop “gene therapy in a box.” Doctors who work on cutting-edge stem cell treatments say it could help spread gene therapy practice, if regulators allow it to be used for clinical trials. —John Jenkins, the director of the FDA’s office of new drugs, isn’t done criticizing eteplirsen (Exondys 51), the Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug from Sarepta Therapeutics (NASDAQ: SRPT) that Jenkins’ bosses approved last month after an internal tug of war. Jenkins was one of many FDA staffers who stood against the approval. In a speech this week before the National Organization of Rare Disorders in Arlington, VA, Jenkins had harsh words, including this: “The path taken by Sarepta is not a good model for other development programs.” His slides are here. THE REGULATORS’ THUMBS GO UP AND DOWN —Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) won FDA approval for the first new treatment in 40 years for soft tissue sarcoma, a type of cancer. The special “accelerated” approval means Lilly must conduct a successful Phase 3 trial to maintain the FDA’s green light. —The FDA also approved the atezolizumab (Tecentriq), developed by Roche’s Genentech group, for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer that fits a certain genetic profile. Genentech, Merck, and Bristol-Myers Squibb are all vying to treat lung cancer with immunotherapy drugs, and they rolled out data at a medical conference earlier this month. —Data from atezolizumab and other “checkpoint inhibitors” will soon be part of Xconomy’s new cancer immunotherapy trial resource. It debuted this week with a compilation of data from the other main type of immunotherapy: genetically modified T cells. —European regulators approved Onivyde, a pancreatic cancer drug developed by Cambridge, MA-based Merrimack Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: MACK). Shire holds rights to the drug in Europe. —The FDA suspended a trial of chronic pain drug fasinumab, citing safety issues. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE: TEVA) paid Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: REGN) $250 million last month to co-develop fasinumab, part of a class of drugs with a checkered safety history. —Shares of South Plainfield, NJ-based PTC Therapeutics (NASDAQ: PTCT) fell more than 30 percent after the FDA refused to reconsider its rejection of its Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug ataluren (Translarna). PTC said it would continue to appeal to higher levels within the agency. TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS —Shares of Alkermes (NASDAQ: ALKS) climbed more than 38 percent after the company reported positive data from the third of three Phase 3 trials of experimental depression drug ALKS-5461. —Partners Theravance Biopharma (NASDAQ: TBPH) and Mylan (NASDAQ: MYL) reported positive Phase 3 data for their lung disease treatment revefenacin and expect to ask for marketing approval next year. —Celgene reported early results for a pill called mongersen for Crohn’s disease, an important drug in its pipeline. The data, from a small trial that wasn’t placebo controlled, drew a mixed reaction from analysts. —Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ: GILD) said it would move its experimental treatment for fatty liver disease into Phase 3 trials despite Phase 2 data that The Street described as “hard to interpret.” —Shares of Rigel Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: RIGL) fell more than 22 percent after fostamatinib, a drug for a rare platelet disease, failed the second of … Next Page » Single PageCurrently on Page: 1 2 Alex Lash is Xconomy's National Biotech Editor.

New Jersey Jewish News Home News Statewide World Greater MetroWest Middlesex/Monmouth Princeton Mercer Bucks Community About Free E-Newsletter Advertise Subscribe Contact Us Classifieds Home > Greater MetroWest News Healthcare Foundation makes up agencies’ shortfalls Federation groups get grants for special needs, counseling, seniors Share | + enlarge image Marsha Atkind, executive director/CEO of the Healthcare Foundation of NJ, said, “Federation funding for many of its agencies has declined substantially in recent years, but the populations they are serving have not decreased.” + more images Advertisements by Robert Wiener NJJN Staff Writer October 20, 2016 Three social service agencies funded by the Jewish Federation of Greater MetroWest NJ have been awarded grants by the Healthcare Foundation of New Jersey — in part to make up for lost allocations from the federation. The foundation was set up in 1996 with the proceeds from the sale of Newark Beth Israel Medical Center to the Saint Barnabas Healthcare System. Since then it has used its funds to bolster the health-care needs of vulnerable populations in and outside the Jewish community. The largest recipient of the grants was the Jewish Vocational Service of MetroWest NJ, which was awarded of $117,125 to help transform its sheltered workshop for people with special needs into a program to integrate those clients into mainstream workplaces. It is now in the second year of a two-year grant. The JVS lost $147,840 of its federation funding last year, and another $91,399 from New Jersey’s Division of Vocational Rehabilitation Services, said executive director Addy Bonet. The cuts forced JVS to drop 12 of the 84 slots for workshop clients. “We were required to get additional funding because we don’t want to have our clients fall through the cracks,” she told NJJN in an Oct. 11 phone interview. Marsha Atkind, executive director and CEO of the foundation, said that “thinking has changed” about the role of sheltered workshops, in which people are paid below minimum wage for such routine work as stuffing envelopes and putting products into boxes. She said there is now “a new emphasis” on training capable clients for better-paying jobs in mainstream society. Some of them have been given internships by JVS, paid for by Healthcare Foundation grants. They provide salaries for trainees while JVS counselors work with employers on using these workers most productively. “The hope is that if JVS clients work out, employers will hire them and take over payment of their salaries,” Atkind said. Said Bonet, “Without the support from the Healthcare Foundation we would not be able to move forward in the transformation process, and people would be left without services.” The Jewish Family Service of MetroWest is another agency that sustained a cut in its allocation from the GMW federation. It received $475,000 in funds from the federation for fiscal year 2017; in fiscal year 2016 its allocation was $477,928. JFS turned to the Healthcare Foundation for a grant of $62,600 to train its counselors in mindfulness techniques. JFS executive director Reuben Rotman defined mindfulness as “a body of practices that help an individual to find ways to reduce stress and anxiety and to respond to changes in one’s life in as calm and rational a way as possible.” The program will begin in January and will incorporate yoga, meditation, and breathing techniques. The funding will be used to cover program expenses and the hiring of psychotherapist Beth Sandweiss, who cofounded the Jewish Meditation Center of Montclair and will train JFS counselors in mindfulness. Rotman said the program will be conducted at the agency’s Florham Park office as an adjunct to individual therapy sessions with clients. The targeted participants are adults who are chronically ill or are living in stressful circumstances. The third grant was a $40,000 allocation to Jewish Family Service of Central NJ for “Bringing Health Education Home,” a project that will engage a part-time registered nurse and a social worker who will partner with area synagogues, senior housing, and senior centers to lead health education seminars on heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and nutrition for at-risk seniors. Tom Beck, executive director of the JFS of Central NJ, said the project will cover 50 people with home visits and more than 200 others who attend the agency’s health lectures. “We are taking this program on the road,” said Beck. “It will be delivered as a PowerPoint presentation at senior citizens’ centers, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and synagogues.” Unlike the other two grant recipients, the Central NJ JFS has received increases in its allocations from the federation, as well as another $25,000 for the program from the Merck Company Foundation. Its allocation rose by 10 percent to $250,000 for the current fiscal year. “We have always funded health programs in the Jewish community that the agencies couldn’t cover with their funding from the federation,” Atkind said. “I’m not saying the reason we give these agencies these grants is because their budgets have been cut; but their budgets have been cut substantially, and in the last few years they are all having a greater emphasis on fund-raising. “The agencies come to us for things they need that they can’t fund from their core allocations,” she said. “Health is not a priority of the federation — and I’m not saying that it should be. The federation has to make its own decisions about what the priorities should be. “But health is our priority,” said Atkind, “and we want to help the agencies with things we think will help the health and well-being of the Jewish community.”   Share | You might also like: Healthcare Foundation honors humanists New board chair at Healthcare Foundation Healthcare Foundation grants aid to veterans Healthcare ‘hero’ served on two fronts Back to top Reader Discussion Leave a Comment Your Name Your Email (never published) Comment New Jersey Jewish News welcomes your comments.
