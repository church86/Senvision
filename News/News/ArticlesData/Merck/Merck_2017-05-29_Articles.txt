ADVERTISE SUBSCRIBE CONTACT ABOUT INNOVATION Back to the future: The first steps in establishing the Irish biotech cluster 7 hours ago4 Shares Sean Ward made the first strategic move in establishing Ireland as a biotech cluster. Image: Still Life Photography/Shutterstock Dr Barry Heavey remembers one man’s big bet on attracting inward investment for a then early-stage biopharmaceutical manufacturing project in the 1980s, which Ireland has paid back many times over. Despite his unassuming nature, Sean Ward can lay claim to being one of the founding fathers of the burgeoning Irish biotech cluster, which has seen more than €10bn in new investment in the last 10 years and is forecast to add 5,000 new jobs in the coming years in Ireland. The basis for my assertion dates back to the time that Sean worked with IDA Ireland in the early 1980s, when he and his team in IDA was instrumental in winning the first biotech investment from Schering-Plough (now MSD) in 1983. Schering was so impressed with Sean, they hired him and he served in a variety of roles in the US and Ireland, including director of manufacturing and strategic operations, until he retired in 2000. Trailblazer investment The success of Schering’s investment in Brinny, Co Cork was hugely significant in establishing Ireland as a location of choice for biotech investment. It was a trailblazer investment at precisely the time when the biotech revolution was taking off globally, and put Ireland firmly on the map in the sector. The success of that initial investment created a reputation for Ireland that would result in massive additional investment from companies such as Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson (J&J), Bristol-Myers Squibb, Shire, MSD, Regeneron, Amgen, Eli Lilly, Alexion, Sanofi, GE and Allergan in subsequent decades. Given Sean’s key role in both initially winning that investment while in IDA, and his role in making it a success in Schering, I was keen to talk to him to learn more about his experiences and insights. Irish ambition Sean grew up in the 1950s, and he describes Ireland of the time as “bleak”, with a pervasive view that the country would not develop a strong industry base because it had no coal and iron deposits. He saw first-hand how many schoolmates were effectively left with no choice but to emigrate. “It really used to break my heart because I knew guys who were bright, who, if they had been given the chance, were capable of a great deal more than that,” he says. This experience shaped his thinking. After working with the Electricity Supply Board, he moved to ICI in the UK, and of this time he said, “While I enjoyed my time in the UK and learned a huge amount there, I always felt that I would have liked to have a life that didn’t coerce me into being an emigrant.” His role in ICI allowed him to return to Dublin in the early ’70s, where he started to notice what the then-Industrial Development Authority (now IDA) was doing to grow and attract industry in Ireland, and applied for a job there. “I took a 20pc drop in pay and had to give up my company car to join the IDA,” he recalls, “but I was delighted. I was working with a bunch of people who shared my attitude about doing the best for our country. We worked very well as a team, calling each other up in the evenings with advice and guidance on opportunities and challenges that were arising as we dealt with companies visiting Ireland on site visits. We weren’t paid overtime nor were we paid for our phone calls, but we felt compelled.” Cultivating relationships Sean was just a year in that role when he was selected to move to Chicago in 1973 with his family. “I was delighted to be in the front line, representing Ireland with clients. I felt I was pretty well equipped to cultivate relationships and I had some great wins during the six years I spent there,” he says. The companies he attracted to Ireland included Eli Lilly in Cork, Thermo King in Galway and Bausch & Lomb in Waterford. ‘I knew Ireland had plenty of brain power and I had a missionary zeal about harnessing that to ensure we had a chance to partake in the biotech revolution’ – SEAN WARD In 1979, a vacancy came up for a promotion in Dublin to lead the IDA’s pharmaceutical and healthcare sector. He returned to find a significantly expanded organisation with almost 800 people. “It was an exciting time because one of my clients, Lilly, had just collaborated with an upstart biotech company called Genentech to develop the first biotech product: insulin. The biotech revolution was dependent on brain power, not coal or iron deposits. I knew Ireland had plenty of brain power and I had a missionary zeal about harnessing that to ensure we had a chance to partake in the biotech revolution.” The catalyst In 1982, Sean organised a meeting in IDA’s HQ on the theme of biotech, and invited all the relevant academics from Irish universities in Dublin, Cork and Galway. “I felt that biotech represented a huge opportunity and called the meeting to make the point that the biotech sector was burgeoning and could be a catalyst for significant industrial development in Ireland,” he recalls. “My goal was to bring together the multidisciplinary skills that are essential for biotech – such as science, biochemistry and engineering – and ask the Government to commit £5m to £6m to pull together expertise.” Government funding Despite a huge response to this initiative, it wasn’t entirely successful, primarily because of the amount of disagreement between the academics, which Sean found quite disheartening. “Mistrust and mutual suspicion around the table was palpable and I even had to clarify that I wasn’t related to one of the academics!” Eventually, the Irish Government approved £4m in biotech funding. But, as Sean describes it, this money “was split across every point of the compass, which was all but useless”. Sean is glad to hear that the Government has more recently committed substantive funding to biotech, and created a centre of excellence in the form of the National Institute for Bioprocess Research and Training (NIBRT). Sean Ward, the father of the Irish biotech cluster. Image: IDA Ireland Back to the early ’80s, Sean was targeting Schering-Plough, which had an active biotech R&D pipeline. “In particular, I built a relationship with John Nine, who was the senior VP in Schering-Plough at the time. We were facing severe competition from alternative locations, with Puerto Rico being particularly competitive at the time, but we positioned Ireland as a location with an extremely talented and highly educated, English-speaking workforce. We also had to act quickly and decisively in offering grant support to win the project – concrete evidence of support from IDA – and win it we did.” Expansion Such was the strength of Sean’s relationship with John Nine that he was offered a role in Schering in 1983. “I took it because it was a bloody good offer, so I dispensed with all the niceties and notions of patriotic endeavour!” Sean was based in Brinny from 1983 to 1985 when the site was doing pilot production for its key biotech pipeline asset, Intron A. “I cut my teeth there when we had less than 100 people. I then moved to the role of director of manufacturing and strategic planning based in New Jersey and with significant time in other sites such as Puerto Rico and Memphis.” He was based in the US until 1991, when Intron A was approved by the FDA, and he was sent back to Brinny as the site underwent an enormous expansion for commercial production. Academic engagement The big challenge facing Sean was in recruiting people with relevant knowledge and experience. As he puts it: “Experienced biochemists were not hanging out of trees!” Again, he worked closely with the local universities, engaging with their international alumni and sponsoring the first MSc in biotech in Galway. “I persuaded Schering to support some lecturers and the quid pro quo was that the academics would come out and liaise with our scientists and help us build a pipeline of suitably trained graduates. Not all of these interactions were successful – one lecturer felt we were impinging on their academic independence – but in general, we built up strong relationships with the universities and built a strong team in Brinny. I’ve always had the view that you will never see it on a balance sheet but the capability of the staff is the key success factor in any business, and we had that in abundance in Brinny.” ‘You will never see it on a balance sheet but the capability of the staff is the key success factor in any business, and we had that in abundance in Brinny’ – SEAN WARD Brinny then became the postgraduate training centre for people who went on to other biotech sites in Ireland such as the Wyeth (now Pfizer) Grange Castle facility, and J&J and Lilly facilities in Cork. “I’m proud that we blazed the trail and helped to prove that Ireland could build and sustain such a successful cluster of biotech manufacturers,” is how Sean sums up his work. Sean also pays tribute to the “very positive” attitude of people in Schering, such as John Nine, to IDA and Ireland. “I know that Schering’s positive experience and endorsements helped in convincing other companies to establish their biotech operations in Ireland. It was my job to ensure that that relationship between Schering and IDA stayed strong and that any issues that might arise were flagged to IDA and dealt with as soon as possible. Minimising bureaucracy and being responsive was key to maintaining a strong partnership.” Ongoing opportunities Looking forward, Sean sees huge opportunities to win investment in areas such as research and innovation, and he believes investing in these areas will attract companies. But he warns: “We shouldn’t underestimate how difficult this will be because the international competition is intense. We have to put enough bait on the hook to attract in companies, and we have to place a few bets on a few long shots.” Sean Ward had a passion for his country and a vision that Ireland could use the natural resource it had in abundance – talent – to win in a revolutionary new area of technology. He convinced IDA to take a big leap of faith in trying to attract the first biotech investment in the early 1980s when the technology was relatively nascent. He can be enormously proud of his achievement with that investment and the ripple effect it has had in the Irish economy since then.

"The non-objection was given. Now there's a Medecins Sans Frontiers team that is arriving (in Congo) today to validate the protocol with the technical teams," Jonathan Simba, a health ministry spokesman, told Reuters by telephone. The vaccine was developed by Merck and is known as rVSV-ZEBOV. It has not been licensed yet but it has proven to be highly protective against Ebola in clinical trials that were published last December. The vaccine was studied in a trial in Guinea in 2015 involving a total of 11,841 people. Of the 5,837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination. In comparison, there were 23 cases 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine, according to the study reported in the journal Lancet. The rVSV-ZEBOV was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada. The vaccine was licensed to NewLink Genetics, who in turn licensed it to Merck & Co. As of Friday, DR Congo has 52 suspected cases of Ebola, World Health Organization (WHO) spokesman in Congo, Eugene Kabambi, said by telephone. He added that the situation appears to be under control. The details of the vaccination campaign are to be presented at a meeting of the health ministry and its partners either today or on Tuesday. The biggest concern appears to be the logistics of getting the vaccine to the region, which is isolated and without roads.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Meet the Cancer Therapy that Could Become the Second Best-Selling Drug in the World by Year's End Conservatively, this cancer drug is expected to generate between $8 billion and $8.3 billion in full-year sales. Sean Williams (TMFUltraLong) May 29, 2017 at 8:21AM The pharmaceutical industry is big business. According to the International Trade Administration's Top Markets Report on pharmaceuticals last year, the global drug market is expected to grow from about $1 trillion in sales in 2015 to $1.3 trillion by 2020, representing about 5% annual growth. And at the center of that growth trend is the U.S. market. U.S. drugmakers are thriving The U.S. is an optimal target for drug developers for a variety of reasons. To begin with, the U.S. lacks a universal healthcare system, meaning Congress has no true ability to cap or limit drug pricing. The Food and Drug Administration also grants exceptionally long patent protection periods for novel therapies, which prevent the entrance of cheaper generic medicines. Additionally, insurers have a tendency to accept rather than fight drugmakers' pricing for fear of losing members by excluding a popular drug. And, of course, who can forget that demand for pharmaceuticals is higher in the U.S. than any other country in the world. This laundry list of catalysts makes the U.S. an optimal market for drugmakers to thrive -- and thrive they have. Image source: Getty Images. Last year, AbbVie's (NYSE:ABBV) anti-inflammatory drug Humira, the best-selling drug in the world, tallied $16.08 billion in sales. A little more than $10.4 billion of this was recognized in the United States, with strong pricing power helping to push sales of its leading therapeutic up 24% year-over-year domestically. Another major success story was Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) with its hepatitis C drug Harvoni. Even though sales of Harvoni, which has a list price of $94,500 for a standard 12-week treatment, dipped in 2016 as a result of Gilead having hit the "low-hanging fruit" and treating the sickest HCV patients in 2014 and 2015, the drug still generated $9.08 billion in full-year sales. Nearly $5 billion of that came from the U.S. In fact, five drugs in total managed to eclipse the $8.5 billion annual sales mark in 2016. After Humira and Harvoni were Amgen's (NASDAQ: AMGN) and Pfizer's (NYSE:PFE) anti-inflammatory drug Enbrel, Roche's (NASDAQOTH: RHHBY) and Biogen's cancer drug Rituxan, and Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) and Merck's anti-inflammatory therapy Remicade. Big changes are in the offing for the world's top-selling drugs However, we appear to be on the verge of seeing some major shifts atop the best-selling drug leaderboard. For example, Remicade is dealing with the entrance of Inflectra, a biosimilar drug (essentially a copycat version of a biologic drug) that's priced at a 15% discount to its list price and is being marketed by Pfizer. Sales of Remicade dipped by more than 10% in 2016, largely driven by weakness in Europe. Without pricing power, Remicade sales are liable to fall again in 2017. Image source: Getty Images. Likewise, increased competition in the anti-inflammatory space and the signing of new supply contracts has put the kibosh on Enbrel's pricing power. Amgen has been regularly using hefty price increases on Enbrel to drive growth, but that came to a crashing halt in the first quarter. Sales of Amgen's former lead drug dropped by 15% in Q1. Roughly 12% of this decline came from a reduction in sales volume, while about 2% came from a decrease in Enbrel's price. Even Gilead's Harvoni could see further pressure in 2017. Increasing competition in the HCV space from the likes of Merck, which priced its HCV drug Zepatier nearly $40,000 below Harvoni for a standard 12-week treatment, have Gilead forecasting $7.5 billion to $9 billion in full-year hepatitis C sales. Mind you, this includes sales from Sovaldi and Epclusa, its respective first and newest HCV drugs, not just Harvoni. The one exception this year, other than Humira, which is leaving its competition in the dust on an annual sales basis, is Rituxan. Roche reported a 4% increase in sales of the drug during the first quarter. Nonetheless, biosimilars of Rituxan may be ready to hit pharmacy shelves sooner than investors realize, and Rituxan's patents won't last that much longer either. Even Rituxan could see its sales reverse sooner rather than later. This cancer drug could ascend to the No. 2 spot in 2017 With some of the top-selling drugs potentially seeing their sales decline in the quarters and years that lie ahead, it looks as if Celgene's (NASDAQ:CELG) multiple myeloma blockbuster Revlimid has an outside chance of claiming the No. 2 spot among best-selling therapies in 2017. Celgene stuck by a forecast for $8 billon to $8.3 billion in full-year Revlimid sales, although it's been notoriously conservative with its sales estimates throughout the years.  Image source: Getty Images. Revlimid's success has been based on a confluence of factors. To begin with, demand for Revlimid is on the rise. An increase in multiple myeloma diagnoses, which is a result of an increase in population and earlier detection of the disease, has lifted demand for a go-to drug used as a first- and second-line therapy. Celgene also has exceptional pricing power with its lead drug. Though list prices of cancer drugs are often a well-kept secret, Celgene has had little trouble passing along higher price points to insurers and patients. Considering its exceptional market share in treating multiple myeloma, Revlimid shouldn't face much in the way of pricing pressure short of federal legislation that caps drug prices (which is unlikely). Celgene also notes that duration-of-use for its key therapy has helped its sales growth. Improvements in the multiple myeloma treatment process have allowed patients to remain on Revlimid for a longer period of time, ultimately boosting sales for Celgene. Lastly, Revlimid has multiple label expansion opportunities beyond multiple myeloma. These include first-line follicular lymphoma, relapsed/refractory indolent lymphoma, and first-line ABC-subtype diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. These aren't major money indications for Celgene like multiple myeloma, but they provide a channel to nicely increase sales. This is what sets Revlimid apart from the rest of its peers However, there's an additional factor that sets Revlimid apart from the group. In Dec. 2015, Celgene worked out a settlement with a number of generic-drug manufacturers over Revlimid. One manufacturer will be allowed to introduce a limited generic supply of the drug beginning in March 2022 and extending through 2025. By Jan. 31, 2026, a flood of generic Revlimid can finally enter the market. In effect, Celgene cleared a decade-long runway for its lead drug to keep growing. Image source: Getty Images. On the other hand, we're seeing a clear decline in sales of Harvoni, Enbrel, and Remicade, and Rituxan and even AbbVie's Humira are just a few years away from losing sales due to patent expirations. In other words, Revlimid may have a path to not only generate $10 billion-plus in annual sales -- it could become the best-selling drug in the world by the early 2020s. There's obviously a lot that could happen between now and the early 2020s, including new competition in multiple myeloma, as well as the introduction of a new therapy that ramps up quicker than Revlimid. An example would be Biogen's experimental Alzheimer's disease drug aducanumab. If successful in late-stage trials and approved by the Food and Drug Administration, it could have $10 billion in peak annual sales potential, if not more. Nevertheless, Revlimid has a clear path to higher sales for at least the next couple of years, and if things go Celgene's way it could become the second best-selling drug in the world by the end of this year.

CC0 / Pixabay / World Health Organization: Adolescent Digital Screen Addiction Major Health RiskHealth authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) gave conditional approval for an Ebola virus vaccine to be administered in the country on Monday. After working to control at least eight outbreaks of the deadly disease over the past 10 years, officials with DRC Health Ministry gave their approval for the new vaccine, developed by US pharmaceutical giant Merck. "The non-objection was given. Now there's a Medecins Sans Frontieres team that is arriving [to the DRC] today to validate the protocol with the technical teams," stated DRC health ministry spokesman Jonathan Simba, according to Reuters. The Merck rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine remains unlicensed, but has been shown to be effective against Ebola in clinical trials. Four deaths attributed to the Ebola virus have been recorded in northeastern regions of the DRC in recent weeks, according to the Turkish Anadolu news agency, as officials again move quickly to stem another outbreak, according to reports for the World Health Organization (WHO). WHO has confirmed 52 new cases of the deadly disease in the most recent wave, but has added that the situation is under control. The logistical challenge of a wide-ranging vaccination campaign in the deep forests of the central African country is compounded by the need to transport and store the vaccines in custom-built containers kept at temperatures of minus 80 degrees Celsius prior to their use. ...

Companies and Nine Academic Institutions - Research and Markets News provided by Research and Markets 29 May, 2017, 16:30 ET Share this article DUBLIN, May 29, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Genetic Disorder Cluster Muscular Dystrophy Drug Development Pipeline Review, 2017" report to their offering. This report provides an overview of the genetic disorders pipeline landscape. The report provides comprehensive information on the therapeutics under development and key players involved in therapeutic development for Becker and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (BMD and DMD) and features dormant and discontinued projects. Both indications covered are inherited muscular dystrophies, a group of genetic, degenerative diseases primarily affecting voluntary muscles. BMD, the first type of muscular dystrophy, leads to symptoms include pain and sensation, difficulty with running, hopping, and jumping, toe walking, breathing problems, cognitive problems and frequent falls. There are a total of six products in development for this indication, by six seperate companies; the companies operating in this pipeline space are all small pharmaceutical enterprises, and consist of Armgo Pharma, Cardero Therapeutics, Milo Biotechnology, PTC Therapeutics, ReveraGen BioPharma and Sarepta Therapeutics. DMD is a condition which causes muscle weakness, and is an X-linked disorder. The gene for DMD is present on the X chromosome. It codes for a protein named dystrophin. Dystrophin is essential for providing structural support inside muscle cells. Symptoms usually appear before age 6 and may appear as early as infancy. They include fatigue, learning difficulties, intellectual disability, muscle weakness and progressive difficulty walking. There is a far larger pipeline for DMD than for BMD; there are a total of 108 products in development for DMD, by 57 companies and nine academic institutions. Key companies operating in this pipeline space include Sarepta Therapeutics, PTC Therapeutics, WAVE Life Sciences, Solid Biosciences, Summit Therapeutics and Catabasis Pharmaceuticals. Of particular importance are Sarepta, who are developing twelve distinct pipeline products for DMD. As with BMD, these are all smaller enterprises, although there is some involvement from larger pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer and Merck in the DMD pipeline. The majority of pipeline products for DMD target dystrophin which, as mentioned, is the causative gene for the disease.

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider Fox Business Home Markets Politics Features Media & Advertising Cloud Innovation Business Leaders Technology FBN TV SHOWS ANCHORS & REPORTERS SCHEDULE VIDEO Search Congo Approves Anti-Ebola Vaccine to Combat Outbreak in Remote Northeast ADVERTISEMENT On Our Radar Refresh Close On Our Radar Load More Congo Approves Anti-Ebola Vaccine to Combat Outbreak in Remote Northeast By Nicholas Bariyo Published May 29, 2017 Features Dow Jones Newswires Facebook Twitter Print KAMPALA, Uganda--The Democratic Republic of the Congo on Monday approved the use of a new experimental Ebola vaccine, nearly three weeks after health officials announced the latest outbreak of the deadly virus along the country's northeastern border. Continue Reading Below The approval was granted by Congo's health ministry, spokesman Simba Kai said. The ministry must now decide whether to use the vaccine, which was developed by Merck & Co. The ministry, the World Health Organization and the medical aid organization Doctors Without Borders were discussing plans for the vaccine, Mr. Kai said. A spokeswoman for Merck said the company "stands ready to ship vaccine, if and when" Congo decides to use it. There have been only two confirmed cases of Ebola in the latest flare-up, and at least three more who likely had it. It isn't clear if the virus is still spreading. While some 52 cases have been registered, most have been designated as potential cases and are under investigation. Experts from the WHO say the delays in Congo's approval of the vaccine have been an impediment in efforts to contain the latest eruption of the disease, which was confirmed May 12. The current outbreak in Congo is the first since 2014-16, when at least 28,600 people were infected in West Africa, including 11,310 who died--by far the largest Ebola outbreak in history. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Reports in the aftermath of that epidemic called for major overhauls in global health financing and in the WHO, which took on most of the blame for a delayed response that allowed the disease to spiral out of control. Since then, it has established new guidelines and procedures for responding to reports of telltale symptoms of the disease. Monday's announcement that the vaccine had been approved for use in Congo came after Congolese experts finished a review of the protocol for using the vaccine, Mr. Kai said. Merck announced earlier this month that it was ready to release the vaccine but because the serum isn't yet licensed, it can only be administered under a clinical study, which must be approved by government. The company has agreed with the international vaccine alliance GAVI to ship doses of the vaccine to the location of the latest outbreak. The development of an Ebola vaccine is a significant breakthrough, especially for Congo, which has been afflicted by more outbreaks of the disease than any other nation in the world. The latest isn't far from the Ebola River, after which the virus was named in 1976. But Congo is sub-Saharan Africa's most sprawling country, and any vaccination campaign will be complicated by the remoteness of the current outbreak, centered in Likati, about 800 miles northeast of the capital Kinshasa. There are no road or rail links between Likati and Kisangani, the nearest city. Health officials are relying on motorbikes to reach the forested region, near Congo's border with the Central African Republic. To be effective, the anti-Ebola vaccine must be stored in special containers at a temperature of minus 80 degrees Celsius. Equipment to safely ship and store the vaccine has arrived in Congo from Guinea, where trials of the vaccine during the large outbreak in 2015 were effective, said the WHO spokesman in Congo, Eugene Kabambi.

(AP Photo/Aurelie Marrier d'Unienville) Share Written by Yomi Kazeem Obsession Contagion May 29, 2017 Quartz africa In its battle to stop the spread of the Ebola after a recent outbreak, a new WHO-backed vaccine is the Democratic Republic of Congo’s weapon of choice. On May 12, the World Health Organization declared an Ebola outbreak in DR Congo after it confirmed three deaths. At the time, the United Nations health agency said there was no cause for panic. Now, with as many as 52 suspected cases, DR Congo’s health ministry is stepping up its response and has approved the use of a new experimental vaccine to stop the outbreak. In published findings from tests of the vaccine, rVSV-ZEBOV, it showed a 100% protection rate. During trials conducted in Guinea, thousands of people tested were all confirmed as virus-free within 10 days. While WHO said at the time that the vaccine will not be available for mass use until 2018, pharmaceutical giants Merck, backed by GAVI, a global vaccine alliance, made 300,000 doses of the vaccine available in the event of an outbreak. That foresight could yet pay off in DR Congo where officials claim that up to 400 people that may have had contact with some of the individuals suspected of carrying the virus are now being tracked down. In a previous outbreak mainly in the West African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, the Ebola virus killed over 11,000 people as health services were ill-prepared to respond to the outbreak. For its part, WHO also admitted to a slow response to the outbreak. In contrast, the Congolese government reacted quickly (link in French) to its outbreak, sending a team of doctors and scientists to the affected area to treat the suspected cases and investigate the extent of infection. DR Congo’s relative containment of the virus so far has been attributed to the outbreak’s occurrence in a remote part of the country’s northeast. But that may yet prove a pitfall as the remoteness of the area could hamper a vaccination campaign as officials will have to deal with issues such as difficult logistics and storage for the vaccine which needs to be kept in containers set at a temperature of -80 degrees Celsius.

"The non-objection was given. Now there's a Medecins Sans Frontieres team that is arriving (in Congo) today to validate the protocol with the technical teams," Jonathan Simba, a health ministry spokesman, said by telephone. The vaccine, known as rVSV-ZEBOV and developed by Merck , is not yet licensed but was shown to be highly protective against Ebola in clinical trials published last December. As of Friday, Congo had registered 52 total suspected cases, including two that have been confirmed, the World Health Organization (WHO) spokesman in Congo, Eugene Kabambi, said by telephone, adding that the situation appeared to be under control. Simba said that the details of the vaccination campaign would be announced after a meeting of the health ministry and its partners. WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said in Geneva that vaccination would be deployed "should an EVD (Ebola virus disease) laboratory confirmed case be identified outside already defined chains of transmission". In that case, it would be offered "to contacts and contacts of contacts of a confirmed EVD case, including health care workers and field laboratory Workers", Jasarevic said. A vaccination campaign would present logistical challenges in Congo's isolated northeastern forests, including transporting and storing the vaccine in special containers at the required minus 80 degrees Celsius.

Oncologic therapeutics cannot cure cancer and yet in 2014, the overall market for cancer therapeutics stood at about $84.3 billion. Any drug that can provide a reasonable survival of more than five years for cancer patients can achieve a blockbuster status. Within cancer therapeutics, immunotherapeutic drugs have gained worldwide acceptance, because they are targeted drugs targeting only cancer cells. Today, cancer immunotherapy drugs have captured nearly 50% of the overall oncology drugs market, generating about $41.0 billion in 2014 alone. This report describes the evolution of such a huge market in 20 chapters supported by over 180 tables and figures in 317 pages. Key Questions Answered in this Report • What is the global market for cancer immunotherapeutics by product class such as MAbs, vaccines and non-specific immunotherapies, through 2020? • What is the global market for cancer immunotherapeutics by geography, through 2020 • What is the global market for cancer immunotherapeutics by indication, through 2020? • What is the global market for MAbs by type such as naked MAbs and ADCs, through 2020? • What are the market values for Herceptin, Avastin, Erbitux, Yervoy, Mabthera, Adectris, and Keytruda? • What is the global market for cancer vaccines? • What is the global market for cytokines in cancer immunotherapy? • The projected market values for Nivolumab, RG7446, DCVax-L, MEDI4736 ? • What immunotherapies were approved between 1986 and 2016? • What monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were approved by the FDA to treat different types of cancers? By Segment (Monoclonal Antibodies, Cancer Vaccines, Non-Specific Therapies, Checkpoint Inhibitors) By Product Segment (Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs), Bispecific Monoclonal Antibodies, Cytokines, Interferons, Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-Cell Therapy, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, Dendritic Cells, Adopted Cell Therapy (ACT) & IDO Inhibitors) By Company (e.g Amgen, Merck, Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline, Janssen, Genentech, Roche, Bristol Myers Squibb) A comprehensive account of company product portfolios are provided for 79 Cancer Immunotherapy pharma and biotech companies including: Amgen Inc. Biogen Idec Inc.x Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Cellectis Cellerant Therapeutics Inc. Celldex Therapeutics Eli Lilly and Co. EMD Serono Inc. Genentech Inc. Genmab AS GlaxoSmithKline ImmunoGen Inc. Immunomedics Inc. Janssen Biotech Inc. Juno Therapeutics Inc. Merck & Co., Inc. Oxford BioTherapeutics Ltd. Progenics Pharmaceuticals Inc. Roche Holdings Inc. Seattle Genetics Inc. Sorrento Therapeutics Inc Kite Pharma Novartis Executive Summary Prior to the launching of Yervoy, the five-year survival rate for patients with early stage melanoma was 98%; but the five-year survival rate for late-stage melanoma was just 16%. Yervoy has been reported to have a survival rate of 25% when tested alone. When tested as part of a combination therapy treatment with Bristol’s nivolumab, the two-year survival rates rose to 88% for patients with late-stage cancer.

Collaboration and merger activities are therefore taken swing in the global monoclonal antibody therapeutics market as players look to expand their geographic reach and product portfolio. Also these companies are in favor of partnership as it would allow them reduce the cost incurred in the production of monoclonal antibodies, need for skilled professionals, and investment in research and development, finds Transparency Market Research (TMR) in a new study. Some of the most prominent companies operating in the global monoclonal antibody therapeutics market are Sanofi, Bayer AG, Pfizer Inc., F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Novartis AG, GlaxoSmithKline Plc., Merck & Co., Inc., and AbbVie Inc. According to TMR, the global monoclonal antibody therapeutics market will reach US$245.8 bn by the end of 2024, from US$86.7 bn in 2015. If these figures hold true, the global monoclonal antibody therapeutics market will exhibit a strong CAGR of 12.6% between 2016 and 2024. Obtain Report Details @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/monoclonal-antibody-th… Use of Monoclonal Antibody Therapeutics in Treatment of Autoimmune Diseases to Remain High Monoclonal antibody therapeutics are used in the treatment of diseases such as autoimmune diseases, cancer, hematological diseases, and ophthalmological diseases. Of these, the demand for monoclonal antibody therapeutics in the treatment of autoimmune diseases is expected to showcase a phenomenal rise. As per TMR, between 2016 and 2024, the autoimmune diseases segment will exhibit a CAGR of 13.5%. Regionally, North America is forecast to continue dominating the global monoclonal antibody therapeutics market. By the end of 2024, North America is expected to hold a little short of 38% of the global monoclonal antibody therapeutics market. Rising Cancer Cases Worldwide to Fuel Demand for Monoclonal Antibody Therapeutics The rising incidence of chronic ailments will give impetus to the market worldwide. The rising health concerns besides increasing diagnoses of cancer at various stages has fuelled the demand for effective therapeutics in the last few years. As a per the latest studies by the World Health Organization (WHO), the cancer cases worldwide will witness a massive spike of 70% in the near future, of which 60% cases will be attributable to Asia, Africa, and Latin America. To counter this looming threat to human lives, nations have collaborated in the fight against chronic ailments. Hence incremental approvals in monoclonal antibody products is expected across the U.S. and Europe. According to TMR, nearly five or six monoclonal antibodies get approval each year in the aforementioned regions. Moreover, among the 60 monoclonal antibodies, which received approval in Europe, 48 have already hit the market. This widening product portfolio, which is available at a diverse price range, has helped in accelerating the pace of gains for the market players.

Most mistakenly think it's the West - survey The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine developed by Merck is not yet licensed but was shown to be highly protective against Ebola in clinical trials (Adds WHO spokesman on conditions of deployment, paragraphs 6-7, adds byline) By Aaron Ross KINSHASA, May 29 (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo's health ministry has approved the use of a new Ebola vaccine to counter an outbreak in its northeast that has killed four people, a spokesman said on Monday. "The non-objection was given. Now there's a Medecins Sans Frontieres team that is arriving (in Congo) today to validate the protocol with the technical teams," Jonathan Simba, a health ministry spokesman, said by telephone. The vaccine, known as rVSV-ZEBOV and developed by Merck , is not yet licensed but was shown to be highly protective against Ebola in clinical trials published last December. As of Friday, Congo had registered 52 total suspected cases, including two that have been confirmed, the World Health Organization (WHO) spokesman in Congo, Eugene Kabambi, said by telephone, adding that the situation appeared to be under control. Simba said that the details of the vaccination campaign would be announced after a meeting of the health ministry and its partners. WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said in Geneva that vaccination would be deployed "should an EVD (Ebola virus disease) laboratory confirmed case be identified outside already defined chains of transmission". In that case, it would be offered "to contacts and contacts of contacts of a confirmed EVD case, including health care workers and field laboratory Workers", Jasarevic said. A vaccination campaign would present logistical challenges in Congo's isolated northeastern forests, including transporting and storing the vaccine in special containers at the required minus 80 degrees Celsius.

Although the Tipperary man, who now heads up the human health division of one of the country's biggest healthcare employers, MSD Ireland, qualified as a nurse, he knew he was destined for a career in the drugs business. But the path was far from smooth. "I remember when I used to do the drug rounds," he says. "I'd be going through the packages to see if I could get contact details. And I used to write to these guys individually and someone said to me one day 'What have you really done to try and get into this job?'. I said 'As motivation I keep my PFOs'." "I had over 100 'thank you very much for applying for this position, we have you on file, blah, blah, blah'." For several years, it was a fruitless pursuit until the model for employing drugs reps in Ireland began to change. "I was going to recruitment agencies but then a company called Innovex came onto the scene and they kind of brought in a new model that was contract reps. "So, Innovex were bringing in nurses and people who had done science and giving us six-month contracts so that got the door open for me." Once the door was opened, there was no turning back for Brennan (44). Working his way up through pharma giants such as Bayer and Wyeth, he joined MSD in 2010, taking on a number of senior international positions. He took over the senior role in Ireland last August. As well as being managing director of the group's human health business in Ireland, Brennan is head of MSD's country council for Ireland which oversees the development of MSD's presence here. Less than a year into the job, he is overseeing significant investment here, with the group announcing last month that it will invest €40m in its manufacturing facility in Ballydine, Co. Tipperary this year. It is part of a €75m spend over the last three years to upgrade the site's facilities. Among the developments being invested in is the installation of a new spray-drying facility at the plant - a technology used in a number of products to increase their solubility and improve how the medicines are absorbed by patients. It is all part of ensuring Ireland remains a cutting-edge location for the group in an ever-more competitive global pharmaceutical sector. And in February, MSD announced that it is to expand its clinical trials programme in Ireland, with a particular focus on the latest developments in the treatment of cancer. That saw the company commit up to €25m to Irish-based clinical trials and related R&D activities over the next three years. "We're here 50 years and we have eight sites," says Brennan. "Why are we still investing in Ireland? You know, one of the strong things I think we come across is the talent in our people in Ireland. Now it would be remiss of me if I didn't mention the tax breaks and the 12.5pc corporate tax, but is that the main driver? I don't think so." Ireland is a key location in terms of size for the group although it has scaled back operations in some locations. It is about to close a plant in Swords, for example, which employed 570 people. "That's going to shut down in the next couple of weeks," says Brennan. "But I suppose the big thing there, we were able to delay that shutdown by over two years." Read more: Drug giant MSD's €40m upgrade 'a vote of confidence' While some operations have wound down, other businesses have expanded, such as the site in Ballydine. "With 1,800 employees we would be one of the largest operations for MSD globally. And the testament on that is at the end of this month, we have 1,500 MSD executives flying in for a three-day conference in the convention centre. "You know 50pc of the top 20 MSD products globally are manufactured here in Ireland." One of the more recent concerns facing the Irish pharma sector has been a pledge by US president Donald Trump to bring drug production back to the US. Brennan believes it is not something to be concerned about. "I think we've responded very, very quickly to President Trump when he made that narrative," says Brennan. "Our own CEO has had two meetings with the President and he basically gave the commitment to the President that yes, there will be manufacturing and future manufacturing in the US for US drugs." "Outside of the US we need to have manufacturing for drugs that we actually commercialise in Europe so President Trump wasn't as familiar with the whole supply chain at that time," he adds. "Is it a concern for me today? Absolutely not. We've just announced the €75m in Ballydine. We have the significant investment we're going to announce over the next couple of months in our other facilities and also Keytruda, which is our leading oncology drug that globally we're manufacturing out of Carlow." Keytruda, one of MSD's most exciting new drugs, uses the latest in biotechnology to fight cancer. "We have the body acting as the chemotherapy in targeting the cancer cells," says Brennan. Finding new drugs to fight Alzheimer's is also high on the agenda. "We're all looking for the target, this compound that will actually curtail the progression of the disease. I mean that's going to be a game-changer, whoever can identify that." The company's large workforce requires a diverse set of skills. "Our medics, our medical advisers, they're all doctors or consultants in very specialised areas. If I look at our commercial organisation here, all the people have basic degrees and higher. "Then when I get into the manufacturing process, we have very high-skilled labour here, so we've technicians, we have a lot of PhD students, a lot of engineers," says Brennan. "Because when you're dealing with biotechnology, it's a rapid, rapid process so we need to bring in the brightest minds, a lot of people with significant experience. The challenge is keeping them." Nine of the 10 top pharma firms are in Ireland, so Brennan says it is "extremely competitive". Wage inflation is "not an issue for us but it's something we do a lot of work on so it doesn't become an issue", he says. While fears over Trump's statements on pharma production may have been put to one side, Brexit does pose some potential challenges. "To be fair, people are really not sure what way this is going to look. "However, supply chain is going to be a challenge for us because we've a centralised pact with the UK - as do many pharmaceutical companies," says Brennan. "So if there's no way where we can put kind of a holding agreement in place to allow us to actually take a step back and say OK, how do we change this ... that to me is probably what would keep me awake at night. That we don't have interruption to our supply chain." There are opportunities, however. Health Minister Simon Harris is making a serious effort to bring the London-based European Medicines Agency (EMA) to Ireland. Brennan says it would bring huge benefits to Ireland. "We would be seen as a major player when it comes to pharmaceuticals. If I look at our footprint from a manufacturing perspective and then you have the EMA on side...I mean we've heard some companies say they would move their organisations to where EMA sits." However, other countries are fighting hard to win over the agency and there is some scepticism in the industry about Ireland's chances of succeeding. Having taken up his role in August, Brennan is keen to have MSD's voice heard at a government level and has strong views about the future of healthcare in Ireland. "I suppose one thing that I'm very passionate about is that at MSD Ireland, we don't want just to be seen as a pharmaceutical company in the corner," he says. "This year we set up a policy and government affairs department and that brought in a very strong policy and government affairs leader [former minister of state and Road Safety Authority chair Liz O'Donnell] for us in that space. And the idea is that we can work with government around Stem (science, tech, engineering and maths) so that they will come to us to collaborate rather than you're just going in to discuss bringing new products to the market. It's more about thinking the long term and the more holistic approach," he says. There has been a lot of discussion about the cost of medicines in Ireland in recent years. Brennan believes it has gone in the right direction. "I'm very pleased with the new deal," he says of the drugs agreement with the State made last June. "That will save nearly €800m over a four-year agreement." Another development impacting on production is the shift towards artificial intelligence, automation and augmented reality. However, Brennan does not believe it will have much downside for employment numbers. "I think on the biotech side it's at a fairly automated process as is, but still requires a level of staffing. For example, in Carlow - which is probably one of the most advanced technology plants - we still have nearly 400 people employed there. While a lot of it is automated, you need to have a lot of quality and control within the process so it won't take it away, no."

Business Lessons Best business advice You need to ensure you've a very strong team and people that understand their role within that organisation and then you actually empower them to do that job Most challenging time in business A European role I took in a commercial operations role. I had a team that didn't really know their purpose but then I had an organisation that didn't see the value of that team either. I had to repurpose the team but I wanted the team to find their value.

ADVERTISE SUBSCRIBE CONTACT ABOUT All Advice People Employers Jobs Careers The world’s top biotech and pharma companies sure have shown the love for Ireland. Image: Deborah Benbrook/Shutterstock Ireland is a home for 24 of the world’s top biotech and pharma companies by Elaine Burke 7 hours ago150 Shares Life Sciences Week on Siliconrepublic.com kicks off with a breakdown of the top players in the industry that have made a home for themselves in Ireland. Roughly 20 years ago, Ireland had about 50 biopharma companies dotted throughout the country. Recent numbers put that figure at more than 300 companies. New life sciences players are regularly moving in while those that have been here long-term have set down roots for future growth. It’s no surprise, then, that we see regular announcements on Siliconrepublic.com showing that biotech and pharma companies are one of the most active in recruitment. Out of the world’s 25 largest (by market capitalisation) independent, public biotech and pharma companies, only one – Celgene – has decided to forgo an office on these shores. Celgene UK and Ireland was established as an affiliate office in London in 2006. And so we are left with the two dozen others, profiled below, starting with the largest first. Johnson & Johnson Familiar to millions as a household brand, Johnson & Johnson is the largest biotech in the world, employing more than 125,000 people across 60 countries. The Johnson & Johnson family of companies has been operating in Ireland for 80 years, with almost 3,000 employees across a network of locations including Johnson & Johnson Vision Care in Limerick, DePuy Synthes in Co Cork, and multiple Janssen operations in Cork and Dublin. Roche Headquartered in Basel, Switzerland, Roche started out as a provider of vitamins and was the first company in the world to mass-produce synthetic vitamin C. These days, it is a multinational pharma and diagnostics healthcare powerhouse with a commercial operation in Citywest, Dublin and a manufacturing site in Clarecastle, Co Clare. The latter is a manufacturing centre of excellence for the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients, which are used to develop medicines at other Roche facilities around the world. Pfizer Pfizer has seven locations across four counties in Ireland, employing more than 3,300 people in all. Pfizer was one of the first pharmaceutical companies to locate in Ireland when it set up in 1969, and the work carried out here includes R&D, manufacturing, shared services, treasury and commercial operations. The company has invested more than $7bn in its Irish operations in its almost 50 years here, including a $30m lab in Ringaskiddy, Co Cork that opened in 2014. Novartis Even before Pfizer, there was Novartis, which arrived in Ireland in the 1950s. Also headquartered in Basel, Novartis employs about 1,500 people in Ireland. The Dublin team provides scientific and commercial services, IT, HR operations and procurement. In Cork, two Ringaskiddy manufacturing sites produce active pharmaceutical ingredients for a range of oncology, respiratory, cardiovascular, dermatology, central nervous system and transplantation medicines. The multinational’s Irish footprint also includes Alcon’s facility in Cork, as Novartis acquired the eye care company in 2012. MSD MSD (Merck Sharp & Dohme) also has a long legacy in Ireland that stretches back over the last 50 years and, in that time, the company has invested more than $2.5bn in expanding and developing its facilities here. Over the half-century, MSD has developed treatment methods in the areas of diabetes, heart disease, immunology, oncology, infectious diseases, women’s health and anaesthesia. MSD’s Irish sites – in Dublin, Carlow, Cork and Tipperary – are involved in the production of more than 60pc of the company’s global top 20 products. Learn about Life at MSD Life at MSD Amgen US biopharma Amgen’s Irish activity stems back to its purchase of Pfizer’s Dún Laoghaire facility back in 2010, spending $300m and five years revamping the site in its own image. The development included the construction of a new production plant, a cold-chain warehouse and a full refurb of existing buildings. A new syringe-filling facility positions the Dún Laoghaire plant as a key location within Amgen’s plans, with state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities bulking up the company’s global operations. Its other office in Ireland is in Santry, Dublin. Sanofi Sanofi Waterford was born out of Sanofi-Aventis SA’s $20.1bn purchase of Genzyme back in 2011, creating a global pharma force. Employing around 600 people in Ireland, its products are focused on rare inherited disorders, kidney disease, orthopaedics, cancer, transplant and immune disease, and diagnostic testing. In 2013, €44m was put into the Waterford campus to increase production of insulin product Lantus. AbbVie After Abbott Laboratories separated into two publicly traded companies, AbbVie came into being as a research-based biopharmaceutical manufacturer in 2013. AbbVie is spread across five sites in Ireland, comprising three manufacturing facilities in Sligo and Cork, and two Dublin offices performing commercial and operations activities. In January this year, the US multinational announced a partnership with Irish start-up Genomics Medicine Ireland to map the genomes of 45,000 Irish people for use in improved drug development. GlaxoSmithKline GSK’s Irish operations are spread across Dublin, Sligo, Waterford and Cork. Active ingredients for nine of GSK’s medicines (including treatments for cancer, depression and Parkinson’s disease) are manufactured in Cork. The Sligo site manufactures 40 different formulations of skin healthcare products, while familiar pharmacy brands Panadol and NiQuitin come from the Waterford site in Dungarvan. Bayer Though Bayer has been in Ireland for almost 50 years, it has one of the smaller employee footprints, with around 100 people headquartered in Dublin. The German chemical and pharma giant focuses on healthcare and agriculture, developing new molecules to help improve the health of humans, animals and plants. Last year, the company was named as one of the Best Workplaces by Great Place to Work Ireland. Eli Lilly Hiring Now Life-changing career opportunities for you Helping the world be well. Work for what matters. Always at the cutting edge of new innovation Be part of a globally successful team American pharmaceutical business Eli Lilly and Company has had an Irish presence since the 1970s, beginning with the development of a manufacturing facility in Kinsale, Co Cork. Eli Lilly’s medicines are used in the treatment of cancer, diabetes, depression, osteoporosis, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and many other illnesses. Taking into account the firm’s other facilities in Dublin and Cork city (sales and marketing, and global business solutions, respectively), Eli Lilly employs more than 800 people in Ireland. Gilead Sciences American biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences focuses on the discovery, development and commercialisation of therapeutics and medicines. Gilead’s Ireland operations are responsible for manufacturing, quality control, packaging, and the release and distribution of the company’s products in the European Union and other international locations, such as the countries supported by the Gilead Access Programme. Its most notable products are the hepatitis C drugs, Harvoni and Sovaldi. Bristol-Myers Squibb Globally, pharma giant Bristol-Meyers Squibb (BMS) employs more than 27,000 people, including about 550 in Ireland as part of its global manufacturing and supply (GMS) and commercial operations. BMS’s Irish workforce is spread across four facilities, including two pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing facilities and a drug testing facility in Dublin, and another manufacturing facility in Shannon, Co Clare. It produces medicines that tackle diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hepatitis B, HIV/AIDS, rheumatoid arthritis and psychiatric disorders. Learn about Life at Bristol-Myers Squibb Life at Bristol-Myers Squibb Allergan Pharma company Allergan directly employs almost 1,700 people in Ireland and, according to economic consultants DKM, this supports a further 600 jobs in the supply chain and 500 jobs in the wider economy. Marking 40 years of business in Ireland this year, the company confirmed an additional investment of €42m in its Irish operations in 2017, as well as a €50,000 Innovation Award Programme with Irish colleges. Headquartered in Dublin, Allergan operates two manufacturing facilities in Dublin and Westport, Co Mayo. AstraZeneca Anglo–Swedish multinational AstraZeneca is a science-led biopharma business producing medicines for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, and oncology and respiratory patients. AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals Ireland is primarily a sales and marketing company based in Dublin city centre. Currently, about 50 people are employed by AstraZeneca in Ireland, spanning sales, marketing, medical and regulatory affairs, IT, finance and administration. Abbott Here since 1946, Abbott Laboratories is home to nearly 3,000 employees across 10 sites in Ireland. The Irish operations are focused on delivering locally manufactured healthcare solutions designed specifically for this market – specifically, science-based nutritional products, diagnostic tools and medical devices. Abbott’s vast Irish network takes in Clonmel, Cootehill, Donegal, Longford, Dublin and Sligo, and includes manufacturing as well as commercial and support facilities. Novo Nordisk Novo Nordisk has a global workforce of 42,000 employees, almost half of whom are based in the company’s native Denmark. The company’s five key product areas are diabetes care, obesity and weight management, haemophilia management, growth hormone therapy, and hormone replacement therapy. Novo Nordisk maintains an Irish foothold with offices in Dublin and, in January, it made a defiant post-Brexit decision to invest £115m (€134m) in a new research centre in Britain at the University of Oxford. Biogen Biogen is an American multinational biotech headquartered in Massachusetts. Biogen develops, manufactures and markets innovative treatments for neurological, neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases. The company has committed to providing an inclusive workplace and, for two years in a row, has held a 100pc Corporate Equality Index score from the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, which rates US workplaces on LGBTQ equality. Biogen maintains an Irish office at United Drug House, Dublin. Shire Earlier this year, Shire Pharmaceuticals officially opened a new city centre Irish HQ, having moved from west Dublin. The global manufacturer of medicines for rare diseases expects to house 300 employees at the 76,000sq ft Miesian Plaza office, including commercial and technical operations (supply chain and IT). Last year, Shire revealed plans for a manufacturing operation in Co Meath, with 400 employees required on the 120-acre site. This operation will employ the latest bioprocessing techniques and flexible production strategies, enabling it to supply both clinical and commercial-scale products. Stryker Medtech multinational Stryker Corporation is active in more than 100 countries worldwide. Its presence in Ireland began in 1998 and, over the last 17 years, Stryker has built its research, development and manufacturing operations here through investment and acquisitions. Stryker operates a number of sites in Cork and Limerick, employing engineers, scientists and support staff in research and development. Regeneron Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, a New York-headquartered biotech company founded in 1988, opened its first facility outside of the US in Dublin in 2013. Dublin is home to the firm’s EMEA headquarters, and houses Regeneron’s business operations in Europe, from regulatory affairs to pharmacovigilance. When Regeneron arrived in Ireland in 2013, the company also invested €310m in developing a facility in Limerick, this time devoted to manufacturing. This Industrial Operations and Product Supply (IOPS) facility in Raheen launched in 2015 and works to produce medicines for patients around the world. Teva Teva Pharmaceuticals is an Israeli multinational pharmaceutical company headquartered in Petah Tikva. In March, Teva announced that it will close a testing laboratory in Dundalk, Co Louth next year amid worldwide cost-cutting. Dundalk is the seat of Teva’s commercial arm in Ireland, managing the sales and support services for Teva’s large portfolio of products for cardiovascular, central nervous system and respiratory health, as well as pain relief and infection control. A manufacturing division in Waterford is responsible for the manufacture and development of respiratory products for supply to the US and other global markets, while a smaller facility in Dublin produces Sudocrem nappy rash cream. Baxter For more than 50 years, Baxter International has had a presence and long-standing commitment in Ireland. One of the largest suppliers to hospitals and home patients, Baxter has 50,000 employees worldwide, serving patients and clinicians in more than 100 countries. Baxter has offices in Dublin and Belfast as well as manufacturing sites in Dublin and Mayo. The company primarily focuses on products to treat haemophilia, kidney disease, immune disorders and other chronic and acute medical conditions. Alexion Alexion Pharmaceuticals is a relative newcomer to the Irish biopharma scene, having opened its first Irish facility in Dublin in 2013, establishing its global supply chain and quality operations with 60 employees. Now, the company employs around 300 staff across its three facilities, and has announced several phases of local expansion. First, the acquisition of a site in Athlone, Co Westmeath, which now houses an aseptic vial fill-finish facility; followed by the acquisition of a 41-acre site at College Park in Blanchardstown. The latter now serves as the company’s new global supply chain and operations headquarters, with laboratory, office, packaging and warehouse facilities in one location. Blanchardstown will also be home to a new 20,000sq m bulk biologics manufacturing facility that is currently under development, and the Athlone facility is also being expanded to house another biologics manufacturing facility on-site.

Democratic Republic of Congo's health ministry has approved the use of a new Ebola vaccine to counter an outbreak of the hemorrhagic fever in its northeast that has killed four people, a spokesman said on Monday.   "The non-objection was given. Now there's a Medecins Sans Frontiers team that is arriving [in Congo] today to validate the protocol with the technical teams," Jonathan Simba, a health ministry spokesman, said by telephone.   The experimental vaccine, known as rVSV-ZEBOV, was partially designed by the Canadian government and is being developed by the U.S.-based Merck & Co. It is not yet licensed but was shown to be highly protective against Ebola in clinical trials published last December. Ebola vaccine success in Guinea praised by WHO chief As of Friday, Congo had registered 52 total suspected cases, including two that have been confirmed, the World Health Organization spokesman in Congo, Eugene Kabambi, said by telephone, adding that the situation appears to be under control.   Simba said that the details of the vaccination campaign would be announced after a meeting of the health ministry and its partners set to take place on Monday or Tuesday.   A vaccination campaign would present logistical challenges in Congo's isolated northeastern forests, including transporting and storing the vaccine in special containers at the required minus 80 degrees Celsius.  With files from CBC News © Thomson Reuters, 2017 Report Typo or Error Send Feedback Stay Connected with CBC News Mobile Facebook Podcasts Twitter Alerts Newsletter Top News Headlines B.C.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 29 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Global Glaucoma Market Size, Share, Rising Growth, Industry Analysis & Outlook (2017-2021) Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases which result in damage to the optic nerve and vision loss. The most common type is open-angle glaucoma with less common types including closed-angle glaucoma and normal-tension glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma develops slowly over time and there is no pain. Side vision may begin to decrease followed by central vision resulting in blindness, if not treated. Closed-angle glaucoma can present gradually or suddenly. The sudden presentation may involve severe eye pain, blurred vision, mid-dilated pupil, redness of the eye, and nausea. Vision loss from glaucoma, once it has occurred, is permanent. Though, glaucoma cannot be cured completely but the disease progression can be controlled with the help of available treatments. There are three types of modalities available for treatment of glaucoma: Drugs, Laser and Invasive Surgery. Further, based upon the approaches employed for the medication, it can be segmented into two parts: PGA Medication and Non-PGA Medication. The PGA approach reduces IOP with the help of prostaglandin (PGA). The non-PGA medication can be further divided into four sub segments: Beta blockers, Alpha blockers, Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) and Combination Products. Several factors such as rising prevalence of diabetes, growing geriatric population and rising health care expenditure along with increasing disposable income and growing obese population will drive the market growth in the next few years. Development of new drugs & devices and drug therapy focused upon IOP are the few notable market trends. However, high cost of treatment, severe side effects and hasty drug approval processes act as a major roadblock for the market growth.

(Source: Reuters) Democratic Republic of Congo’s health ministry has approved the use of a new Ebola vaccine to counter an outbreak of the hemorrhagic fever in its northeast that has killed four people, a spokesman said on Monday. “The non-objection was given. Now there’s a Medecins Sans Frontiers team that is arriving (in Congo) today to validate the protocol with the technical teams,” Jonathan Simba, a health ministry spokesman, said by telephone. The vaccine, known as rVSV-ZEBOV and developed by Merck , is not yet licensed but was shown to be highly protective against Ebola in clinical trials published last December. As of Friday, Congo had registered 52 total suspected cases, including two that have been confirmed, the World Health Organization spokesman in Congo, Eugene Kabambi, said by telephone, adding that the situation appears to be under control. Simba said that the details of the vaccination campaign would be announced after a meeting of the health ministry and its partners set to take place on Monday or Tuesday. A vaccination campaign would present logistical challenges in Congo’s isolated northeastern forests, including transporting and storing the vaccine in special containers at the required minus 80 degrees Celsius.

Yervoy has been reported to have a survival rate of 25% when tested alone. When tested as part of a combination therapy treatment with Bristol’s nivolumab, the two-year survival rates rose to 88% for patients with late-stage cancer. Increase in patient survival rates brought about by cancer immunotherapy treatment is similar to that seen when bone marrow transplantation changed our conception on how blood cancer was treated.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Antibacterial Drugs Market: Business Challenges, Emerging Technologies & Competitive Landscape A new market research study, titled “Antibacterial Drugs Market – Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast 2015 – 2023,” has been published by Transparency Market Research. As per the study, in 2014, the global antibacterial drugs market was worth US$43.9 bn. The market is projected to exhibit a 1.30% CAGR between 2015 and 2023, declining in value to touch US$38.9 bn by the end of 2023. An antibacterial drug is an antimicrobial agent that interferes with the reproduction and growth of bacteria. The growth of this bacteria can cause severe infections in animals and humans. The administration of antibacterial drugs helps in inhibiting the growth of the bacteria or completely killing it. At present, several antibacterial drugs in different formulations are available and are widely used for treating tuberculosis, legionellosis, like pneumonia, diarrhea, diphtheria, tetanus, and other diseases. Some of the prominent consumers of the global antibacterial drugs market are private clinics, hospitals, patients, and physicians. This 110 page report gives readers a comprehensive overview of the antibacterial drugs market. Browse through 9 data tables and 40 figures to unlock the hidden opportunities in this market: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/antibacterial-drugs-ma… The growing prevalence of infections and other diseases across the globe and increasing government support for research and development activities are some of the key drivers of the global antibacterial drugs market. However, the upcoming patent expirations and growth in drug-resistant species are projected to curtail the growth of the market in the coming years. The decline in the markets valuations will primarily be attributable to this negative factor. In 2014, the β-lactams segment accounted for a 58% share in the global antibacterial drugs market and is estimated to be in the topmost position in the next few years. In the same year, the quinolones segment accounted for a 17% share in the global market and is expected to exhibit negative growth rate in the forecast period. Furthermore, the miscellaneous antibacterial segment is projected to witness significant growth owing to the growing demand for therapies against bacterial infections and rising geriatric population. The strong pipeline in the global antibacterial drugs market includes RHB-105, Eravacycline, Ozenoxacin, Arikace, Carbavance (meropenem/RPX7009), Surotomycin (MK-4261), SYM-1219, Solithromycin (CEM-101), Plazomycin, Ciprofloxacin/Fluocinolone Acetonide, SPL7013, Actoxumab/Aezlotoxumab, (MK-3415A), Omadacycline (PTK-0796), Zempia (E-101), Cadazolid, Delafloxacin, and Delamanid. The major players are making constant efforts to commercialize these drugs, which is estimated to propel the global antibacterial drugs market in the near future. At present, Asia Pacific accounts for the largest share in the global antibacterial drugs market and is projected to grow at a fast pace throughout the forecast period. The rapid growth of this region can be attributed to the strong presence of generic pharmaceutical ingredients and generic manufacturers, a growing geriatric population, and expanding population. In addition, the growing incidence of several bacterial infections including MRSA and TB, developing healthcare infrastructure, and rising purchasing power of consumers are some of the other factors anticipated to drive global antibacterial drugs market in the coming years. Request a sample of this report to know what opportunities will emerge in the rapidly evolving antibacterial drugs market during 2015 – 2023: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Asia Pacific is followed by North America and Europe. These regions are expected to witness sluggish growth throughout the forecast period. The slow-paced growth of the North America and Europe antibacterial drugs markets can be attributed to the strict regulatory requirements, market maturity, and shortened product lifecycle. The prominent players engaged in the global antibacterial drugs market include Bayer AG, Forest Laboratories, Inc., Allergan plc, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca plc, Sanofi, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Eli Lilly & Co., Novartis AG, Merck & Co., Inc., and Pfizer, Inc. These players are leading the overall market and witnessing intense competition amongst each other. Among these players, Pfizer, Inc. is considered as a dominant player owing to its significant contribution towards the global antibacterial drugs market.

Research and Markets 29 May, 2017, 09:45 ET Share this article Dublin, May 29, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Global Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Drug and Devices Market - Analysis and Forecast 2017-2023 (Focus on Device Type, Drug Type, Market Share Analysis, Patent Landscape and Country Analysis)" report to their offering. The GERD market is mainly driven by the dearth of treatment options. Most of the blockbuster drugs have gone off patent paving way for the generic & OTC products in the market. Due to low safety, efficacy & poor reimbursement of devices & procedures, these are not popular among physicians & patients alike. The lack of new regulatory approved medication as well as limited acceptability of devices are the major limitations of the market. The drug market is occupied by generics & OTC products. By drug class, the market can be classified into antacids, proton pump inhibitors (PPI), histamine-2 receptor blockers (H2RA), prokinetics & complementary & alternative medicines. The antacid class has the largest market share as they provide quick relief and are available over-the-counter. The PPIs constitute the next major market share & are the first line treatment in moderate to severe GERD. H2RA are also prescribed in combination with PPIs or alone where required. The long term use of PPIs is associated with increased risk of bone fractures, low magnesium absorption, C.difficile infections etc. This is prompting patients to look for other treatment options. With the advent of generics & OTC products the growth in GERD drugs market has decreased. The absence of patent protected & new regulatory approved medicines are the restraints for the growth of this market. The global GERD drugs market has a low growth potential in future and will account to $5.38 billion by 2023. Due to side effects of drugs on long term use, patients who fail to respond to medication & the availability of new technology, the device market is set to grow in future. The market is dominated by drugs as they are the first line treatment for the early & mild cases of GERD. But the number of drugs in the pipeline are less & market is well established in the drugs segment. The GERD Therapy Market is divided into drugs & devices segment based on product type. The drugs segment is an established market offering antacids, PPIs, H2RAs & prokinetics. The drugs market will not show much growth in future due to loss of patent protection & absence of novel treatment options. The device segment is growing at a CAGR of 15.3% from 2017 to 2023. The devices can be categorised into invasive & non-invasive treatment procedures. Currently available devices are MUSE, LINX reflux device, Stretta & GERD-X among others. The devices are classified as invasive & non-invasive based on the procedures followed. Invasive procedures include LINX management system & MUSE while the non-invasive include EsophyX, Endostim, Stretta, Durasphere, GERD-X. The diagnostic devices include Bravo reflux management system & Digitrapper.

Considerable progress in the animal health biotechnology took place recently when biotechnology applications were utilized in both detecting and treating various infectious and parasitic diseases of animals. This has led to the development of a range of applications and procedures, which will benefit both domestic and wild animals. This will also improve the health of various companion animals, help in improving sporting animals’ performance and the productivity of farm animals. However, the globalised trade in live animals, animal products, and their feeds is leading to a continuously increasing threat of infectious diseases worldwide. Thus, to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) emphasizes the importance of very rapid, accurate, highly specific and sensitive detection and identification of infectious agents; and prompt and effective control of those diseases. Obtain Report Details @www.transparencymarketresearch.com/animal-health-biotechn… Animal Health Biotechnology Market: Current Outlook Presently, various reagents and diagnostic techniques have been developed, which are more specific, sensitive, rapid, reproducible and robust that have been updated through recent discoveries in biochemistry, immunology and molecular biology (monoclonal antibodies, nucleic probes, DNA amplification and others). The development of new vaccines, such as subunit vaccines, synthetic vaccines, recombinant vaccines and anti-idiotype vaccines, which combine efficacy, innocuity, duration of protection, ease of use, stability and multivalence. The availability of new anti-parasitic and anti-infective agents and immunomodulatory therapeutic agents specifies that biotechnology is continuing to find new applications in the field of animal health. These new vaccines, diagnostic techniques, and therapeutic substances will add to the knowledge, which, in future, will extend to the development of transgenic animals with improved genetic potential and will be more disease resistant and more productive at the same time.
