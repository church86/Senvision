At this year’s meeting, researchers will present data from more than 50 abstracts investigating the use of KEYTRUDA as monotherapy and in novel combinations across 16 cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, urothelial carcinoma, microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) cancers, gastric cancer and breast cancer. Additional longer-term progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) data for KEYTRUDA in monotherapy and as a combination therapy in first-line NSCLC from KEYNOTE-024 and KEYNOTE-021G will be presented. As noted in the abstracts, in KEYNOTE-024 significant improvement in OS was maintained with KEYTRUDA compared to chemotherapy with a longer follow-up of approximately six months; and in KEYNOTE-021G with more than five months of additional follow-up, a trend for improved OS with KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin (pem/carbo) was observed when compared to pem/carbo alone, despite high rates of patient cross-over. Additional data on these findings will be presented at the meeting. “Our data at ASCO bring to life the potential of KEYTRUDA across many different cancer types as both monotherapy and in combination, and underscore the remarkable progress that is being made in the fight against cancer,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, Chief Medical Officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “In particular, we continue to show improved survival outcomes in the first-line treatment of both melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, and we highlight clinical collaboration data that explore the potential of novel immunotherapy combinations as a treatment for patients with cancer.” In monotherapy, data for KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) will be presented in NSCLC, melanoma, urothelial carcinoma, gastric cancer and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), among others. In the combination setting, data for KEYTRUDA in NSCLC, TNBC and endometrial cancer, among others, will be presented. Additionally, studies providing insight into the role of biomarkers – such as PD-L1 and microsatellite-instability – across a variety of tumors and treatment settings will be presented. Merck continues to advance the study of genomic markers and signals that can help physicians to identify the treatment regimen that may be best for each patient. Merck Data at the 2017 ASCO Annual Meeting A select listing of the more than 50 Merck-sponsored and collaboration abstracts featuring KEYTRUDA is provided below.

About KEYTRUDA ®(pembrolizumab) Injection KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. Studies of KEYTRUDA – from the largest immuno-oncology program in the industry with more than 500 trials – include a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand factors that predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including the exploration of several different biomarkers across a broad range of tumors. KEYTRUDA ®(pembrolizumab) Indications and Dosing Melanoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Lung Cancer KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥50%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab), as a single agent, is also indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and progression-free survival. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In metastatic NSCLC, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. When administering KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy, KEYTRUDA should be administered prior to chemotherapy when given on the same day. See also the Prescribing Information for pemetrexed and carboplatin. Head and Neck Cancer KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In HNSCC, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), or who have relapsed after three or more prior lines of therapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In adults with cHL, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. In pediatric patients with cHL, KEYTRUDA is administered at a dose of 2 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 200 mg) every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA ®  (pembrolizumab) KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 94 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%) pneumonitis, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (6.9%) compared to those without (2.9%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 48 (1.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) colitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 19 (0.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%) hepatitis. Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis. Hypophysitis occurred in 17 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%) hypophysitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency). Administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. KEYTRUDA can cause thyroid disorders, including hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and thyroiditis. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 96 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%) hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism occurred in 237 (8.5%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%) hypothyroidism. Thyroiditis occurred in 16 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%) thyroiditis. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. Administer replacement hormones for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. KEYTRUDA can cause type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 9 (0.3%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis. KEYTRUDA can cause other clinically important immune-mediated adverse reactions. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction. The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), exfoliative dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid, rash (1.4%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, and partial seizures arising in a patient with inflammatory foci in brain parenchyma. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and postmarketing use. Solid organ transplant rejection has been reported in postmarketing use of KEYTRUDA. Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider benefit of treatment with KEYTRUDA vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients. KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions, including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after being treated with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA on any trial, 6 patients (26%) developed graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), one of which was fatal, and 2 patients (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning, one of which was fatal. Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody before transplantation. These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute GVHD, severe (Grade 3 to 4) acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic VOD, and other immune-mediated adverse reactions, and intervene promptly. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA monotherapy was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 8% of 682 patients with metastatic NSCLC. The most common adverse event resulting in permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA was pneumonitis (1.8%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 23% of patients; the most common (≥1%) were diarrhea (1%), fatigue (1.3%), pneumonia (1%), liver enzyme elevation (1.2%), decreased appetite (1.3%), and pneumonitis (1%). The most common adverse reactions (occurring in at least 20% of patients and at a higher incidence than with docetaxel) were decreased appetite (25% vs 23%), dyspnea (23% vs 20%), and nausea (20% vs 18%). When KEYTRUDA was administered in combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin, KEYTRUDA was discontinued in 10% of 59 patients. The most common adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of KEYTRUDA (≥2%) was acute kidney injury (3.4%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 39% of patients; the most common (≥2%) were fatigue (8%), neutrophil count decreased (8%), anemia (5%), dyspnea (3.4%), and pneumonitis (3.4%).The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) compared to carbo/pem alone were fatigue (71% vs 50%), nausea (68% vs 56%), constipation (51% vs 37%), rash (42% vs 21%), vomiting (39% vs 27%), dyspnea (39% vs 21%), diarrhea (37% vs 23%), decreased appetite (31% vs. 23%), headache (31% vs 16%), cough (24% vs 18%), dizziness (24%vs 16%), insomnia (24% vs 15%), pruritus (24% vs 4.8%), peripheral edema (22% vs 18%), dysgeusia (20% vs 11%), alopecia (20% vs 3.2%), upper respiratory tract infection (20% vs 3.2%), and arthralgia (15% vs 24%). The study was not designed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in adverse reaction rates for KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy, as compared to chemotherapy alone, for any specified adverse reaction. It is not known whether KEYTRUDA is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, instruct women to discontinue nursing during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the final dose.

ET from Merck Merck (PRNewsFoto/Merck)     Facebook Twitter Pinterest Merck (PRNewsFoto/Merck) DARMSTADT, Germany, May 17, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Not intended for UK- or U.S.-based media   ASCO Abstract # M7824 (anti-PD-L1/TGF-ß trap): 3006; Avelumab: 9086, 9530, 9557, 4528, 3059, 5037, e21070, e21065, e20581; Tepotinib: 4087, 8547, e15676, 20541; M3814 (DNA-PK): 2556, e14048; M7583 (BTKi): e14101 ASCO data highlights Merck's strong and rapidly accelerating pipeline in oncology, spanning immuno-oncology to DNA damage response  New avelumab data in metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma and previously treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma, following recent U.S. FDA accelerated approvals   Oral presentation on new immuno-oncology approach anti-PD-L1/TGF-ß trap (M7824); potential first-in-class bifunctional immunotherapy  Merck, a leading science and technology company, today announced that new research from its growing broad oncology portfolio, from immuno-oncology (IO) to DNA damage response (DDR) approaches, will be presented across a broad range of hard-to-treat cancers at this year's American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting (ASCO; June 2-6, Chicago). Over 40 abstracts showcase the impact of Merck's commitment to shaping cancer care today and tomorrow, including data for avelumab*, which is being developed in collaboration with Pfizer, Erbitux® (cetuximab), and pipeline updates on the anti-PD-L1/TGF-ß trap M7824, the DNA-PK inhibitor M3814, the BTK inhibitor M7583, and the c-Met inhibitor tepotinib**. "We are focused on delivering innovation that matters to patients, as shown in our ASCO data that spans across IO and DDR approaches to tackle some of the hardest-to-treat cancers," said Luciano Rossetti, Executive Vice President, Head of Global Research & Development at the biopharma business of Merck. "Merck was among the first to leverage the potential of the PD1/PDL1 pathway for patients, and we continue to build on that progress with our ASCO presence and the two recent FDA accelerated approvals for avelumab." Multiple avelumab presentations at ASCO include data in first-line metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) and previously treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC), as well as results from the Phase Ib trial from the avelumab combination trial with axitinib in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval*** for avelumab for the treatment of mMCC and pretreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC. Avelumab is currently being evaluated as both monotherapy and combination therapy in an extensive clinical development program. Beyond mMCC, locally advanced or metastatic UC and RCC, further avelumab abstracts in non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma will be showcased. In addition to avelumab data, Merck will also feature new research at ASCO on its investigational bifunctional immunotherapy anti-PD-L1/TGF-ß trap (M7824), which is thought to simultaneously block both PD-L1 and TGF-ß. An oral presentation will showcase dose escalation Phase I clinical data exploring the potential of M7824 in advanced solid tumors. Pipeline updates at ASCO also include early clinical results for both Tepotinib, an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase, M7583, an oral, highly selective, covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), and the first clinical data for M3814, an investigational DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) inhibitor. Merck is investing significant resources in the promising area of DDR to be a leader in this field. Merck has recently in-licensed two promising clinical-stage programs from Vertex. This highly focused approach to research and development channels Merck's scientific expertise in areas of high unmet need, a legacy started with Erbitux. Multiple presentations at ASCO reinforce Erbitux as a standard-of-care treatment in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), providing valuable information about biomarkers, disease response, and the importance of tumor location in mCRC, to best target treatment to the right patients. *Avelumab is under clinical investigation for treatment of NSCLC, RCC, DLBCL, SSCHN and mCRPC and has not been demonstrated to be safe and effective for these indications. There is no guarantee that avelumab will be approved for NSCLC, RCC, DLBCL, SSCHN and mCRPC by any health authority worldwide. **Tepotinib is the proposed nonproprietary name for the c-Met kinase inhibitor (also known as MSC2156119J). Tepotinib, M7824 and M3814 are under clinical investigation and have not been proven to be safe and effective. There is no guarantee any product will be approved in the sought-after indication by any health authority worldwide. Notes to Editors  Accepted Merck-supported key abstracts slated for presentation are listed below. In addition, a number of investigator-sponsored studies have been accepted, including multiple abstracts related to Erbitux and avelumab (not listed).

About Avelumab  Avelumab is a human antibody specific for a protein called PD-L1, or programmed death ligand-1. Avelumab is designed to potentially engage both the adaptive and innate immune systems. By binding to PD-L1, avelumab is thought to prevent tumor cells from using PD-L1 for protection against white blood cells, such as T-cells, exposing them to anti-tumor responses. Avelumab has been shown to induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro. In November 2014, Merck and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab. ***Indications The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for avelumab (BAVENCIO®) for the treatment of (i) metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older and (ii) patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or who have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. Avelumab is not approved for any indication in any market outside the U.S. Important Safety Information   The warnings and precautions for BAVENCIO include immune-mediated adverse reactions (such as pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis and renal dysfunction and other adverse reactions), infusion-related reactions and embryo-fetal toxicity. Common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) in patients treated with avelumab include fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, nausea, infusion-related reaction, peripheral edema, decreased appetite/hypophagia, urinary tract infection and rash. About Erbitux® (cetuximab)   Erbitux® is a highly active IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). As a monoclonal antibody, the mode of action of Erbitux is distinct from standard non-selective chemotherapy treatments in that it specifically targets and binds to the EGFR. This binding inhibits the activation of the receptor and the subsequent signal-transduction pathway, which results in reducing both the invasion of normal tissues by tumor cells and the spread of tumors to new sites. It is also believed to inhibit the ability of tumor cells to repair the damage caused by chemotherapy and radiotherapy and to inhibit the formation of new blood vessels inside tumors, which appears to lead to an overall suppression of tumor growth. Erbitux also targets cytotoxic immune effector cells towards EGFR expressing tumor cells (antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, ADCC). The most commonly reported side effect with Erbitux is an acne-like skin rash. In approximately 5% of patients, hypersensitivity reactions may occur during treatment with Erbitux; about half of these reactions are severe. Erbitux has already obtained market authorization in over 90 countries world-wide for the treatment of RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer and for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Merck licensed the right to market Erbitux, a registered trademark of ImClone LLC, outside the U.S. and Canada from ImClone LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company, in 1998. About M3814  M3814 is an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). DNA-PK is a key enzyme for non-homologous end-joining (NEHJ), the most important DNA double strand break repair pathway (DSB), and could potentially enhance the efficacy of many commonly used DNA-damaging agents such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy. M3814 complements Merck's extensive DNA damage response (DDR) portfolio and is currently in Phase I studies. About M7824  M7824, anti-PD-L1/TGF-ß trap, is an investigational potentially first-in-class bi-functional immunotherapy designed to simultaneously block two immuno-inhibitory pathways (PD-L1 and transforming growth factor beta) that are commonly used by cancer cells to evade the immune system. The aim of this investigational drug is to control tumor growth by restoring and enhancing anti-tumor immune responses. M7824 is currently in Phase I studies for solid tumors. About Tepotinib  Tepotinib (also known as MSC2156119J) is an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase. Alterations of the c-Met signaling pathway are found in various cancer types and correlate with aggressive tumor behavior and poor clinical prognosis. Tepotinib is currently under evaluation in Phase I/II trials. About Merck   Merck is a leading science and technology company in healthcare, life science and performance materials. Around 50,000 employees work to further develop technologies that improve and enhance life - from biopharmaceutical therapies to treat cancer or multiple sclerosis, cutting-edge systems for scientific research and production, to liquid crystals for smartphones and LCD televisions. In 2016, Merck generated sales of € 15.0 billion in 66 countries. Founded in 1668, Merck is the world's oldest pharmaceutical and chemical company. The founding family remains the majority owner of the publicly listed corporate group.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Shaping Cancer Care Today and Tomorrow: Merck to Present New Data from Rapidly Evolving Pipeline at ASCO 2017 DARMSTADT, Germany, May 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Not intended for UK- or U.S.-based media   ASCO Abstract # M7824 (anti-PD-L1/TGF-ß trap): 3006; Avelumab: 9086, 9530, 9557, 4528, 3059, 5037, e21070, e21065, e20581; Tepotinib: 4087, 8547, e15676, 20541; M3814 (DNA-PK): 2556, e14048; M7583 (BTKi): e14101 ASCO data highlights Merck's strong and rapidly accelerating pipeline in oncology, spanning immuno-oncology to DNA damage response  New avelumab data in metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma and previously treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma, following recent U.S. FDA accelerated approvals   Oral presentation on new immuno-oncology approach anti-PD-L1/TGF-ß trap (M7824); potential first-in-class bifunctional immunotherapy       (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151207/293543LOGO ) Merck, a leading science and technology company, today announced that new research from its growing broad oncology portfolio, from immuno-oncology (IO) to DNA damage response (DDR) approaches, will be presented across a broad range of hard-to-treat cancers at this year's American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting (ASCO; June 2-6, Chicago). Over 40 abstracts showcase the impact of Merck's commitment to shaping cancer care today and tomorrow, including data for avelumab*, which is being developed in collaboration with Pfizer, Erbitux® (cetuximab), and pipeline updates on the anti-PD-L1/TGF-ß trap M7824, the DNA-PK inhibitor M3814, the BTK inhibitor M7583, and the c-Met inhibitor tepotinib**. "We are focused on delivering innovation that matters to patients, as shown in our ASCO data that spans across IO and DDR approaches to tackle some of the hardest-to-treat cancers," said Luciano Rossetti, Executive Vice President, Head of Global Research & Development at the biopharma business of Merck. "Merck was among the first to leverage the potential of the PD1/PDL1 pathway for patients, and we continue to build on that progress with our ASCO presence and the two recent FDA accelerated approvals for avelumab." Multiple avelumab presentations at ASCO include data in first-line metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) and previously treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC), as well as results from the Phase Ib trial from the avelumab combination trial with axitinib in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval*** for avelumab for the treatment of mMCC and pretreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC. Avelumab is currently being evaluated as both monotherapy and combination therapy in an extensive clinical development program. Beyond mMCC, locally advanced or metastatic UC and RCC, further avelumab abstracts in non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma will be showcased. In addition to avelumab data, Merck will also feature new research at ASCO on its investigational bifunctional immunotherapy anti-PD-L1/TGF-ß trap (M7824), which is thought to simultaneously block both PD-L1 and TGF-ß. An oral presentation will showcase dose escalation Phase I clinical data exploring the potential of M7824 in advanced solid tumors. Pipeline updates at ASCO also include early clinical results for both Tepotinib, an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase, M7583, an oral, highly selective, covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), and the first clinical data for M3814, an investigational DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) inhibitor. Merck is investing significant resources in the promising area of DDR to be a leader in this field. Merck has recently in-licensed two promising clinical-stage programs from Vertex. This highly focused approach to research and development channels Merck's scientific expertise in areas of high unmet need, a legacy started with Erbitux. Multiple presentations at ASCO reinforce Erbitux as a standard-of-care treatment in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), providing valuable information about biomarkers, disease response, and the importance of tumor location in mCRC, to best target treatment to the right patients. *Avelumab is under clinical investigation for treatment of NSCLC, RCC, DLBCL, SSCHN and mCRPC and has not been demonstrated to be safe and effective for these indications. There is no guarantee that avelumab will be approved for NSCLC, RCC, DLBCL, SSCHN and mCRPC by any health authority worldwide. **Tepotinib is the proposed nonproprietary name for the c-Met kinase inhibitor (also known as MSC2156119J). Tepotinib, M7824 and M3814 are under clinical investigation and have not been proven to be safe and effective. There is no guarantee any product will be approved in the sought-after indication by any health authority worldwide. Notes to Editors  Accepted Merck-supported key abstracts slated for presentation are listed below. In addition, a number of investigator-sponsored studies have been accepted, including multiple abstracts related to Erbitux and avelumab (not listed).

About Avelumab  Avelumab is a human antibody specific for a protein called PD-L1, or programmed death ligand-1. Avelumab is designed to potentially engage both the adaptive and innate immune systems. By binding to PD-L1, avelumab is thought to prevent tumor cells from using PD-L1 for protection against white blood cells, such as T-cells, exposing them to anti-tumor responses. Avelumab has been shown to induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro. In November 2014, Merck and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab. ***Indications The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for avelumab (BAVENCIO®) for the treatment of (i) metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older and (ii) patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or who have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 18 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Merck and Pfizer to Present Data Highlighting Potential of Avelumab in Challenging Cancers at ASCO 2017 DARMSTADT, Germany and NEW YORK, May 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Not intended for US, Canada and UK-based media  A total of 13 abstracts across seven hard-to-treat cancers highlight the progress of avelumab as a monotherapy and potential novel combination treatment option   New data in metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma and previously treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma, following recent US FDA accelerated approvals  Merck and Pfizer today announced that 13 avelumab* abstracts across seven challenging tumor types will be featured at the 53rd American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting held June 2-6, 2017 in Chicago, IL. Key presentations include data for avelumab in first-line metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) and in previously treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC), as well as results from the Phase Ib trial investigating avelumab in combination with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib, in advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).      (Logo: http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/477506/Merck_Pfizer_Logo.jpg ) "Our ASCO presence adds to what has already been a momentous year for the alliance, coming shortly after the US FDA granted two accelerated approvals for avelumab," said Luciano Rossetti, M.D., Executive Vice President, Global Head of Research & Development at the biopharma business of Merck, which in the US and Canada operates as EMD Serono. "We're particularly excited to share the latest avelumab data in both metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma in the first-line setting and previously treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma with the cancer community." "Our data at ASCO this year underscore the potential of avelumab as a monotherapy treatment, as well as part of combination regimens," said Chris Boshoff, M.D., PhD, Senior Vice President and Head of Immuno-Oncology, Early Development, Translational Oncology, Pfizer Global Product Development. "Now with accelerated approvals in two indications for avelumab in the US, we are entering the next chapter of our clinical development program to provide meaningful new treatment options for patients who need them most." Highlights of avelumab data at ASCO 2017 include the following: Preliminary data from the ongoing JAVELIN Merkel 200 trial, an open-label, multicenter study conducted in first-line mMCC investigating avelumab in patients who had no prior systemic treatment for mMCC, will be presented for the first time at a medical congress. Data from a pooled analysis of two metastatic UC cohorts of the JAVELIN Solid Tumor trial, a Phase Ib, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study of avelumab in the treatment of various solid tumors, will be presented. An oral presentation of results from the JAVELIN Renal 100 trial, a Phase Ib, open-label study evaluating the clinical activity and safety of the combination of avelumab and axitinib for the first-line treatment of advanced RCC. Beyond mMCC, metastatic UC and RCC, the Merck-Pfizer Alliance will also showcase avelumab abstracts in non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, as well as updated safety data in solid tumors. The alliance's rapidly accelerating JAVELIN clinical development program now involves at least 30 clinical programs, including nine Phase III trials, and more than 5,200 patients across more than 15 tumor types.

There is no guarantee that avelumab will be approved for NSCLC, RCC, DLBCL, SSCHN and mCRPC by any health authority worldwide. About Avelumab  Avelumab is a human antibody specific for a protein called PD-L1, or programmed death ligand-1. Avelumab is designed to potentially engage both the adaptive and innate immune systems. By binding to PD-L1, avelumab is thought to prevent tumor cells from using PD-L1 for protection against white blood cells, such as T-cells, exposing them to anti-tumor responses. Avelumab has been shown to induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro. In November 2014, Merck and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab. Indications   The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for avelumab (BAVENCIO®) for the treatment of (i) metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older and (ii) patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or who have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. Avelumab is not approved for any indication in any market outside the US. Important Safety Information   The warnings and precautions for BAVENCIO include immune-mediated adverse reactions (such as pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis and renal dysfunction and other adverse reactions), infusion-related reactions and embryo-fetal toxicity. Common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) in patients treated with avelumab include fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, nausea, infusion-related reaction, peripheral edema, decreased appetite/hypophagia, urinary tract infection and rash. About the Merck-Pfizer Alliance  Immuno-oncology is a top priority for Merck and Pfizer Inc. The global strategic alliance between Merck and Pfizer enables the companies to benefit from each other's strengths and capabilities and further explore the therapeutic potential of avelumab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody initially discovered and developed by Merck. The immuno-oncology alliance will jointly develop and commercialize avelumab and advance Pfizer's PD-1 antibody. The alliance is focused on developing high-priority international clinical programs to investigate avelumab as a monotherapy, as well as in combination regimens, and is striving to find new ways to treat cancer.

Over 40 abstracts showcase the impact of Merck’s commitment to shaping cancer care today and tomorrow, including data for avelumab*, which is being developed in collaboration with Pfizer, Erbitux® (cetuximab), and pipeline updates on the anti-PD-L1/TGF-ß trap M7824, the DNA-PK inhibitor M3814, the BTK inhibitor M7583, and the c-Met inhibitor tepotinib**. „We are focused on delivering innovation that matters to patients, as shown in our ASCO data that spans across IO and DDR approaches to tackle some of the hardest-to-treat cancers,” said Luciano Rossetti, Executive Vice President, Head of Global Research & Development at the biopharma business of Merck. „Merck was among the first to leverage the potential of the PD1/PDL1 pathway for patients, and we continue to build on that progress with our ASCO presence and the two recent FDA accelerated approvals for avelumab.” Multiple avelumab presentations at ASCO include data in first-line metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) and previously treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC), as well as results from the Phase Ib trial from the avelumab combination trial with axitinib in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval*** for avelumab for the treatment of mMCC and pretreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC. Avelumab is currently being evaluated as both monotherapy and combination therapy in an extensive clinical development program. Beyond mMCC, locally advanced or metastatic UC and RCC, further avelumab abstracts in non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma will be showcased. In addition to avelumab data, Merck will also feature new research at ASCO on its investigational bifunctional immunotherapy anti-PD-L1/TGF-ß trap (M7824), which is thought to simultaneously block both PD-L1 and TGF-ß. An oral presentation will showcase dose escalation Phase I clinical data exploring the potential of M7824 in advanced solid tumors. Pipeline updates at ASCO also include early clinical results for both Tepotinib, an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase, M7583, an oral, highly selective, covalent inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK), and the first clinical data for M3814, an investigational DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) inhibitor. Merck is investing significant resources in the promising area of DDR to be a leader in this field. Merck has recently in-licensed two promising clinical-stage programs from Vertex. This highly focused approach to research and development channels Merck’s scientific expertise in areas of high unmet need, a legacy started with Erbitux. Multiple presentations at ASCO reinforce Erbitux as a standard-of-care treatment in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), providing valuable information about biomarkers, disease response, and the importance of tumor location in mCRC, to best target treatment to the right patients. *Avelumab is under clinical investigation for treatment of NSCLC, RCC, DLBCL, SSCHN and mCRPC and has not been demonstrated to be safe and effective for these indications. There is no guarantee that avelumab will be approved for NSCLC, RCC, DLBCL, SSCHN and mCRPC by any health authority worldwide. **Tepotinib is the proposed nonproprietary name for the c-Met kinase inhibitor (also known as MSC2156119J). Tepotinib, M7824 and M3814 are under clinical investigation and have not been proven to be safe and effective. There is no guarantee any product will be approved in the sought-after indication by any health authority worldwide. Notes to Editors  Accepted Merck-supported key abstracts slated for presentation are listed below. In addition, a number of investigator-sponsored studies have been accepted, including multiple abstracts related to Erbitux and avelumab (not listed).             For further information and press materials please visit http://www.merckgroup.com/en/media/media_center_oncology.html.

In November 2014, Merck and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab. ***Indications The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for avelumab (BAVENCIO®) for the treatment of (i) metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older and (ii) patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or who have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. Avelumab is not approved for any indication in any market outside the U.S. Important Safety Information   The warnings and precautions for BAVENCIO include immune-mediated adverse reactions (such as pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis and renal dysfunction and other adverse reactions), infusion-related reactions and embryo-fetal toxicity. Common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) in patients treated with avelumab include fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, nausea, infusion-related reaction, peripheral edema, decreased appetite/hypophagia, urinary tract infection and rash. About Erbitux® (cetuximab)   Erbitux® is a highly active IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). As a monoclonal antibody, the mode of action of Erbitux is distinct from standard non-selective chemotherapy treatments in that it specifically targets and binds to the EGFR. This binding inhibits the activation of the receptor and the subsequent signal-transduction pathway, which results in reducing both the invasion of normal tissues by tumor cells and the spread of tumors to new sites. It is also believed to inhibit the ability of tumor cells to repair the damage caused by chemotherapy and radiotherapy and to inhibit the formation of new blood vessels inside tumors, which appears to lead to an overall suppression of tumor growth. Erbitux also targets cytotoxic immune effector cells towards EGFR expressing tumor cells (antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, ADCC). The most commonly reported side effect with Erbitux is an acne-like skin rash. In approximately 5% of patients, hypersensitivity reactions may occur during treatment with Erbitux; about half of these reactions are severe. Erbitux has already obtained market authorization in over 90 countries world-wide for the treatment of RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer and for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Merck licensed the right to market Erbitux, a registered trademark of ImClone LLC, outside the U.S. and Canada from ImClone LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company, in 1998. About M3814  M3814 is an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). DNA-PK is a key enzyme for non-homologous end-joining (NEHJ), the most important DNA double strand break repair pathway (DSB), and could potentially enhance the efficacy of many commonly used DNA-damaging agents such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy. M3814 complements Merck’s extensive DNA damage response (DDR) portfolio and is currently in Phase I studies. About M7824  M7824, anti-PD-L1/TGF-ß trap, is an investigational potentially first-in-class bi-functional immunotherapy designed to simultaneously block two immuno-inhibitory pathways (PD-L1 and transforming growth factor beta) that are commonly used by cancer cells to evade the immune system. The aim of this investigational drug is to control tumor growth by restoring and enhancing anti-tumor immune responses. M7824 is currently in Phase I studies for solid tumors. About Tepotinib  Tepotinib (also known as MSC2156119J) is an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase. Alterations of the c-Met signaling pathway are found in various cancer types and correlate with aggressive tumor behavior and poor clinical prognosis. Tepotinib is currently under evaluation in Phase I/II trials. About Merck   Merck is a leading science and technology company in healthcare, life science and performance materials.

About Avelumab Avelumab is a human antibody specific for a protein called PD-L1, or programmed death ligand-1. Avelumab is designed to potentially engage both the adaptive and innate immune systems. By binding to PD-L1, avelumab is thought to prevent tumor cells from using PD-L1 for protection against white blood cells, such as T-cells, exposing them to anti-tumor responses. Avelumab has been shown to induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro. In November 2014, Merck and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab. ***Indications The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for avelumab (BAVENCIO®) for the treatment of (i) metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older and (ii) patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or who have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. Avelumab is not approved for any indication in any market outside the U.S. Important Safety Information The warnings and precautions for BAVENCIO include immune-mediated adverse reactions (such as pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis and renal dysfunction and other adverse reactions), infusion-related reactions and embryo-fetal toxicity. Common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) in patients treated with avelumab include fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, nausea, infusion-related reaction, peripheral edema, decreased appetite/hypophagia, urinary tract infection and rash. About Erbitux® (cetuximab) Erbitux® is a highly active IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). As a monoclonal antibody, the mode of action of Erbitux is distinct from standard non-selective chemotherapy treatments in that it specifically targets and binds to the EGFR. This binding inhibits the activation of the receptor and the subsequent signal-transduction pathway, which results in reducing both the invasion of normal tissues by tumor cells and the spread of tumors to new sites. It is also believed to inhibit the ability of tumor cells to repair the damage caused by chemotherapy and radiotherapy and to inhibit the formation of new blood vessels inside tumors, which appears to lead to an overall suppression of tumor growth. Erbitux also targets cytotoxic immune effector cells towards EGFR expressing tumor cells (antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, ADCC). The most commonly reported side effect with Erbitux is an acne-like skin rash. In approximately 5% of patients, hypersensitivity reactions may occur during treatment with Erbitux; about half of these reactions are severe. Erbitux has already obtained market authorization in over 90 countries world-wide for the treatment of RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer and for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Merck licensed the right to market Erbitux, a registered trademark of ImClone LLC, outside the U.S. and Canada from ImClone LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company, in 1998. About M3814 M3814 is an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). DNA-PK is a key enzyme for non-homologous end-joining (NEHJ), the most important DNA double strand break repair pathway (DSB), and could potentially enhance the efficacy of many commonly used DNA-damaging agents such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy. M3814 complements Merck's extensive DNA damage response (DDR) portfolio and is currently in Phase I studies. About M7824 M7824, anti-PD-L1/TGF-ß trap, is an investigational potentially first-in-class bi-functional immunotherapy designed to simultaneously block two immuno-inhibitory pathways (PD-L1 and transforming growth factor beta) that are commonly used by cancer cells to evade the immune system. The aim of this investigational drug is to control tumor growth by restoring and enhancing anti-tumor immune responses. M7824 is currently in Phase I studies for solid tumors. About Tepotinib Tepotinib (also known as MSC2156119J) is an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase. Alterations of the c-Met signaling pathway are found in various cancer types and correlate with aggressive tumor behavior and poor clinical prognosis. Tepotinib is currently under evaluation in Phase I/II trials. About Merck Merck is a leading science and technology company in healthcare, life science and performance materials.

In the U.S. and Canada, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, operates its biopharmaceutical business as EMD Serono. „We are focused on delivering innovation that matters to patients, as shown in our ASCO data that spans across IO and DDR approaches to tackle some of the hardest-to-treat cancers,” said Luciano Rossetti, Executive Vice President, Head of Global Research & Development at the biopharma business of Merck, KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. „Merck, KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, was among the first to leverage the potential of the PD1/PDL1 pathway for patients, and we continue to build on that progress with our ASCO presence and the two recent FDA accelerated approvals for avelumab.” Multiple avelumab presentations at ASCO include data in first-line metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) and previously treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC), as well as results from the Phase Ib trial from the avelumab combination trial with axitinib in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval*** for avelumab for the treatment of mMCC and pretreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC. Avelumab is currently being evaluated as both monotherapy and combination therapy in an extensive clinical development program. Beyond mMCC, locally advanced or metastatic UC and RCC, further avelumab abstracts in non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma will be showcased. In addition to avelumab data, Merck, KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, will also feature new research at ASCO on its investigational bifunctional immunotherapy anti-PD-L1/TGF-ß trap (M7824), which is thought to simultaneously block both PD-L1 and TGF-ß. An oral presentation will showcase dose escalation Phase I clinical data exploring the potential of M7824 in advanced solid tumors. Pipeline updates at ASCO also include early clinical results for both Tepotinib, an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase, M7583, an oral, highly selective, covalent inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK), and the first clinical data for M3814, an investigational DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) inhibitor. Merck, KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, is investing significant resources in the promising area of DDR to be a leader in this field. Merck, KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, has recently in-licensed two promising clinical-stage programs from Vertex. This highly focused approach to research and development channels Merck, KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany’s scientific expertise in areas of high unmet need, a legacy started with Erbitux. Multiple presentations at ASCO reinforce Erbitux as a standard-of-care treatment in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), providing valuable information about biomarkers, disease response, and the importance of tumor location in mCRC, to best target treatment to the right patients. *Avelumab is under clinical investigation for treatment of NSCLC, RCC, DLBCL, SSCHN and mCRPC and has not been demonstrated to be safe and effective for these indications. There is no guarantee that avelumab will be approved for NSCLC, RCC, DLBCL, SSCHN and mCRPC by any health authority worldwide. **Tepotinib is the proposed nonproprietary name for the c-Met kinase inhibitor (also known as MSC2156119J). Tepotinib, M7824 and M3814 are under clinical investigation and have not been proven to be safe and effective. There is no guarantee any product will be approved in the sought-after indication by any health authority worldwide. Notes to Editors  Accepted Merck, KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany-supported key abstracts slated for presentation are listed below. In addition, a number of investigator-sponsored studies have been accepted, including multiple abstracts related to Erbitux and avelumab (not listed).

Avelumab is designed to potentially engage both the adaptive and innate immune systems. By binding to PD-L1, avelumab is thought to prevent tumor cells from using PD-L1 for protection against white blood cells, such as T-cells, exposing them to anti-tumor responses. Avelumab has been shown to induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro. In November 2014, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab. ***Indications The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for avelumab (BAVENCIO®) for the treatment of (i) metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older and (ii) patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or who have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. Avelumab is not approved for any indication in any market outside the U.S. Important Safety Information   The warnings and precautions for BAVENCIO include immune-mediated adverse reactions (such as pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis and renal dysfunction and other adverse reactions), infusion-related reactions and embryo-fetal toxicity. Common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) in patients treated with avelumab include fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, nausea, infusion-related reaction, peripheral edema, decreased appetite/hypophagia, urinary tract infection and rash. For full prescribing information and medication guide for BAVENCIO, please see http://www.BAVENCIO.com. About Erbitux® (cetuximab)   Erbitux® is a highly active IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). As a monoclonal antibody, the mode of action of Erbitux is distinct from standard non-selective chemotherapy treatments in that it specifically targets and binds to the EGFR. This binding inhibits the activation of the receptor and the subsequent signal-transduction pathway, which results in reducing both the invasion of normal tissues by tumor cells and the spread of tumors to new sites. It is also believed to inhibit the ability of tumor cells to repair the damage caused by chemotherapy and radiotherapy and to inhibit the formation of new blood vessels inside tumors, which appears to lead to an overall suppression of tumor growth. Erbitux also targets cytotoxic immune effector cells towards EGFR expressing tumor cells (antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, ADCC). The most commonly reported side effect with Erbitux is an acne-like skin rash. In approximately 5% of patients, hypersensitivity reactions may occur during treatment with Erbitux; about half of these reactions are severe. Erbitux has already obtained market authorization in over 90 countries world-wide for the treatment of RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer and for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Merck, KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany licensed the right to market Erbitux, a registered trademark of ImClone LLC, outside the U.S. and Canada from ImClone LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company, in 1998. About M3814  M3814 is an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). DNA-PK is a key enzyme for non-homologous end-joining (NEHJ), the most important DNA double strand break repair pathway (DSB), and could potentially enhance the efficacy of many commonly used DNA-damaging agents such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy. M3814 complements Merck, KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany’s extensive DNA damage response (DDR) portfolio and is currently in Phase I studies. About M7824  M7824, anti-PD-L1/TGF-ß trap, is an investigational potentially first-in-class bi-functional immunotherapy designed to simultaneously block two immuno-inhibitory pathways (PD-L1 and transforming growth factor beta) that are commonly used by cancer cells to evade the immune system. The aim of this investigational drug is to control tumor growth by restoring and enhancing anti-tumor immune responses. M7824 is currently in Phase I studies for solid tumors. About Tepotinib  Tepotinib (also known as MSC2156119J) is an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase. Alterations of the c-Met signaling pathway are found in various cancer types and correlate with aggressive tumor behavior and poor clinical prognosis. Tepotinib is currently under evaluation in Phase I/II trials.

Over 40 abstracts showcase the impact of Merck's commitment to shaping cancer care today and tomorrow, including data for avelumab*, which is being developed in collaboration with Pfizer, Erbitux(R) (cetuximab), and pipeline updates on the anti-PD-L1/TGF-ss trap M7824, the DNA-PK inhibitor M3814, the BTK inhibitor M7583, and the c-Met inhibitor tepotinib**. "We are focused on delivering innovation that matters to patients, as shown in our ASCO data that spans across IO and DDR approaches to tackle some of the hardest-to-treat cancers," said Luciano Rossetti, Executive Vice President, Head of Global Research & Development at the biopharma business of Merck. "Merck was among the first to leverage the potential of the PD1/PDL1 pathway for patients, and we continue to build on that progress with our ASCO presence and the two recent FDA accelerated approvals for avelumab." Multiple avelumab presentations at ASCO include data in first-line metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) and previously treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC), as well as results from the Phase Ib trial from the avelumab combination trial with axitinib in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval*** for avelumab for the treatment of mMCC and pretreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC. Avelumab is currently being evaluated as both monotherapy and combination therapy in an extensive clinical development program. Beyond mMCC, locally advanced or metastatic UC and RCC, further avelumab abstracts in non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma will be showcased. In addition to avelumab data, Merck will also feature new research at ASCO on its investigational bifunctional immunotherapy anti-PD-L1/TGF-ss trap (M7824), which is thought to simultaneously block both PD-L1 and TGF-ss. An oral presentation will showcase dose escalation Phase I clinical data exploring the potential of M7824 in advanced solid tumors. Pipeline updates at ASCO also include early clinical results for both Tepotinib, an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase, M7583, an oral, highly selective, covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), and the first clinical data for M3814, an investigational DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) inhibitor. Merck is investing significant resources in the promising area of DDR to be a leader in this field. Merck has recently in-licensed two promising clinical-stage programs from Vertex. This highly focused approach to research and development channels Merck's scientific expertise in areas of high unmet need, a legacy started with Erbitux. Multiple presentations at ASCO reinforce Erbitux as a standard-of-care treatment in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), providing valuable information about biomarkers, disease response, and the importance of tumor location in mCRC, to best target treatment to the right patients. *Avelumab is under clinical investigation for treatment of NSCLC, RCC, DLBCL, SSCHN and mCRPC and has not been demonstrated to be safe and effective for these indications. There is no guarantee that avelumab will be approved for NSCLC, RCC, DLBCL, SSCHN and mCRPC by any health authority worldwide. **Tepotinib is the proposed nonproprietary name for the c-Met kinase inhibitor (also known as MSC2156119J). Tepotinib, M7824 and M3814 are under clinical investigation and have not been proven to be safe and effective. There is no guarantee any product will be approved in the sought-after indication by any health authority worldwide. Notes to Editors  Accepted Merck-supported key abstracts slated for presentation are listed below. In addition, a number of investigator-sponsored studies have been accepted, including multiple abstracts related to Erbitux and avelumab (not listed).

Key presentations include data for avelumab in first-line metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) and in previously treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC), as well as results from the Phase Ib trial investigating avelumab in combination with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib, in advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).      (Logo: http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/512993/Merck_KGaA_Pfizer_Logo.jpg ) "Our ASCO presence adds to what has already been a momentous year for the alliance, coming shortly after the US FDA granted two accelerated approvals for avelumab," said Luciano Rossetti, M.D., Executive Vice President, Global Head of Research & Development at the biopharma business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, which in the US and Canada operates as EMD Serono. "We're particularly excited to share the latest avelumab data in both metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma in the first-line setting and previously treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma with the cancer community." "Our data at ASCO this year underscore the potential of avelumab as a monotherapy treatment, as well as part of combination regimens," said Chris Boshoff, M.D., PhD, Senior Vice President and Head of Immuno-Oncology, Early Development, Translational Oncology, Pfizer Global Product Development. "Now with accelerated approvals in two indications for avelumab in the US, we are entering the next chapter of our clinical development program to provide meaningful new treatment options for patients who need them most." Highlights of avelumab data at ASCO 2017 include the following: Preliminary data from the ongoing JAVELIN Merkel 200 trial, an open-label, multicenter study conducted in first-line mMCC investigating avelumab in patients who had no prior systemic treatment for mMCC, will be presented for the first time at a medical congress. Data from a pooled analysis of two metastatic UC cohorts of the JAVELIN Solid Tumor trial, a Phase Ib, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study of avelumab in the treatment of various solid tumors, will be presented. An oral presentation of results from the JAVELIN Renal 100 trial, a Phase Ib, open-label study evaluating the clinical activity and safety of the combination of avelumab and axitinib for the first-line treatment of advanced RCC. Beyond mMCC, metastatic UC and advanced RCC, the alliance between Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Pfizer will also showcase avelumab abstracts in non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, as well as updated pooled safety data in solid tumors. The alliance's JAVELIN clinical development program now involves at least 30 clinical programs, including nine Phase III trials, and more than 5,200 patients across more than 15 tumor types. Results from JAVELIN program trials have supported two FDA accelerated approvals in 2017. A list of accepted avelumab abstracts is included below. The abstracts are also available on the ASCO website.

 *Avelumab is under clinical investigation for treatment of NSCLC, RCC, DLBCL, SSCHN and mCRPC and has not been demonstrated to be safe and effective for these indications. There is no guarantee that avelumab will be approved for NSCLC, RCC, DLBCL, SSCHN and mCRPC by any health authority worldwide. About Avelumab  Avelumab is a human antibody specific for a protein called PD-L1, or programmed death ligand-1. Avelumab is designed to potentially engage both the adaptive and innate immune systems. By binding to PD-L1, avelumab is thought to prevent tumor cells from using PD-L1 for protection against white blood cells, such as T-cells, exposing them to anti-tumor responses. Avelumab has been shown to induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro. In November 2014, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab. Indications   The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for avelumab (BAVENCIO®) for the treatment of (i) metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older and (ii) patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or who have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Shaping Cancer Care Today and Tomorrow: Merck, KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, to Present New Data from Rapidly Evolving Pipeline at ASCO 2017 DARMSTADT, Germany, May 17, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Not intended for UK-based media  ASCO Abstract # M7824 (anti-PD-L1/TGF-ß trap): 3006; Avelumab: 9086, 9530, 9557, 4528, 3059, 5037, e21070, e21065, e20581; Tepotinib: 4087, 8547, e15676, 20541; M3814 (DNA-PK): 2556, e14048; M7583 (BTKi): e14101 ASCO data highlights Merck, KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany's strong and rapidly accelerating pipeline in oncology, spanning immuno-oncology to DNA damage response New avelumab data in metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma and previously treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma, following recent U.S. FDA accelerated approvals Oral presentation on new immuno-oncology approach anti-PD-L1/TGF-ß trap (M7824); potential first-in-class bifunctional immunotherapy  Merck, KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, a leading science and technology company, today announced that new research from its growing broad oncology portfolio, from immuno-oncology (IO) to DNA damage response (DDR) approaches, will be presented across a broad range of hard-to-treat cancers at this year's American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting (ASCO; June 2-6, Chicago). Over 40 abstracts showcase the impact of Merck, KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany's commitment to shaping cancer care today and tomorrow, including data for avelumab*, which is being developed in collaboration with Pfizer, Erbitux® (cetuximab), and pipeline updates on the anti-PD-L1/TGF-ß trap M7824, the DNA-PK inhibitor M3814, the BTK inhibitor M7583, and the c-Met inhibitor tepotinib**. In the U.S. and Canada, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, operates its biopharmaceutical business as EMD Serono. "We are focused on delivering innovation that matters to patients, as shown in our ASCO data that spans across IO and DDR approaches to tackle some of the hardest-to-treat cancers," said Luciano Rossetti, Executive Vice President, Head of Global Research & Development at the biopharma business of Merck, KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. "Merck, KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, was among the first to leverage the potential of the PD1/PDL1 pathway for patients, and we continue to build on that progress with our ASCO presence and the two recent FDA accelerated approvals for avelumab." Multiple avelumab presentations at ASCO include data in first-line metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) and previously treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC), as well as results from the Phase Ib trial from the avelumab combination trial with axitinib in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval*** for avelumab for the treatment of mMCC and pretreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC. Avelumab is currently being evaluated as both monotherapy and combination therapy in an extensive clinical development program. Beyond mMCC, locally advanced or metastatic UC and RCC, further avelumab abstracts in non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma will be showcased. In addition to avelumab data, Merck, KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, will also feature new research at ASCO on its investigational bifunctional immunotherapy anti-PD-L1/TGF-ß trap (M7824), which is thought to simultaneously block both PD-L1 and TGF-ß. An oral presentation will showcase dose escalation Phase I clinical data exploring the potential of M7824 in advanced solid tumors. Pipeline updates at ASCO also include early clinical results for both Tepotinib, an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase, M7583, an oral, highly selective, covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), and the first clinical data for M3814, an investigational DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) inhibitor. Merck, KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, is investing significant resources in the promising area of DDR to be a leader in this field. Merck, KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, has recently in-licensed two promising clinical-stage programs from Vertex. This highly focused approach to research and development channels Merck, KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany's scientific expertise in areas of high unmet need, a legacy started with Erbitux. Multiple presentations at ASCO reinforce Erbitux as a standard-of-care treatment in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), providing valuable information about biomarkers, disease response, and the importance of tumor location in mCRC, to best target treatment to the right patients. *Avelumab is under clinical investigation for treatment of NSCLC, RCC, DLBCL, SSCHN and mCRPC and has not been demonstrated to be safe and effective for these indications. There is no guarantee that avelumab will be approved for NSCLC, RCC, DLBCL, SSCHN and mCRPC by any health authority worldwide. **Tepotinib is the proposed nonproprietary name for the c-Met kinase inhibitor (also known as MSC2156119J). Tepotinib, M7824 and M3814 are under clinical investigation and have not been proven to be safe and effective. There is no guarantee any product will be approved in the sought-after indication by any health authority worldwide. Notes to Editors  Accepted Merck, KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany-supported key abstracts slated for presentation are listed below. In addition, a number of investigator-sponsored studies have been accepted, including multiple abstracts related to Erbitux and avelumab (not listed).

Avelumab is designed to potentially engage both the adaptive and innate immune systems. By binding to PD-L1, avelumab is thought to prevent tumor cells from using PD-L1 for protection against white blood cells, such as T-cells, exposing them to anti-tumor responses. Avelumab has been shown to induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro. In November 2014, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab. ***Indications The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for avelumab (BAVENCIO®) for the treatment of (i) metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older and (ii) patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or who have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. Avelumab is not approved for any indication in any market outside the U.S. Important Safety Information   The warnings and precautions for BAVENCIO include immune-mediated adverse reactions (such as pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis and renal dysfunction and other adverse reactions), infusion-related reactions and embryo-fetal toxicity. Common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) in patients treated with avelumab include fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, nausea, infusion-related reaction, peripheral edema, decreased appetite/hypophagia, urinary tract infection and rash. For full prescribing information and medication guide for BAVENCIO, please see http://www.BAVENCIO.com. About Erbitux® (cetuximab)   Erbitux® is a highly active IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). As a monoclonal antibody, the mode of action of Erbitux is distinct from standard non-selective chemotherapy treatments in that it specifically targets and binds to the EGFR. This binding inhibits the activation of the receptor and the subsequent signal-transduction pathway, which results in reducing both the invasion of normal tissues by tumor cells and the spread of tumors to new sites. It is also believed to inhibit the ability of tumor cells to repair the damage caused by chemotherapy and radiotherapy and to inhibit the formation of new blood vessels inside tumors, which appears to lead to an overall suppression of tumor growth. Erbitux also targets cytotoxic immune effector cells towards EGFR expressing tumor cells (antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, ADCC). The most commonly reported side effect with Erbitux is an acne-like skin rash. In approximately 5% of patients, hypersensitivity reactions may occur during treatment with Erbitux; about half of these reactions are severe. Erbitux has already obtained market authorization in over 90 countries world-wide for the treatment of RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer and for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Merck, KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany licensed the right to market Erbitux, a registered trademark of ImClone LLC, outside the U.S. and Canada from ImClone LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company, in 1998. About M3814  M3814 is an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). DNA-PK is a key enzyme for non-homologous end-joining (NEHJ), the most important DNA double strand break repair pathway (DSB), and could potentially enhance the efficacy of many commonly used DNA-damaging agents such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy. M3814 complements Merck, KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany's extensive DNA damage response (DDR) portfolio and is currently in Phase I studies. About M7824  M7824, anti-PD-L1/TGF-ß trap, is an investigational potentially first-in-class bi-functional immunotherapy designed to simultaneously block two immuno-inhibitory pathways (PD-L1 and transforming growth factor beta) that are commonly used by cancer cells to evade the immune system. The aim of this investigational drug is to control tumor growth by restoring and enhancing anti-tumor immune responses. M7824 is currently in Phase I studies for solid tumors. About Tepotinib  Tepotinib (also known as MSC2156119J) is an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase. Alterations of the c-Met signaling pathway are found in various cancer types and correlate with aggressive tumor behavior and poor clinical prognosis. Tepotinib is currently under evaluation in Phase I/II trials.

Over 40 abstracts showcase the impact of Merck's commitment to shaping cancer care today and tomorrow, including data for avelumab*, which is being developed in collaboration with Pfizer, Erbitux® (cetuximab), and pipeline updates on the anti-PD-L1/TGF-ß trap M7824, the DNA-PK inhibitor M3814, the BTK inhibitor M7583, and the c-Met inhibitor tepotinib**. "We are focused on delivering innovation that matters to patients, as shown in our ASCO data that spans across IO and DDR approaches to tackle some of the hardest-to-treat cancers," said Luciano Rossetti, Executive Vice President, Head of Global Research & Development at the biopharma business of Merck. "Merck was among the first to leverage the potential of the PD1/PDL1 pathway for patients, and we continue to build on that progress with our ASCO presence and the two recent FDA accelerated approvals for avelumab." Multiple avelumab presentations at ASCO include data in first-line metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) and previously treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC), as well as results from the Phase Ib trial from the avelumab combination trial with axitinib in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval*** for avelumab for the treatment of mMCC and pretreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC. Avelumab is currently being evaluated as both monotherapy and combination therapy in an extensive clinical development program. Beyond mMCC, locally advanced or metastatic UC and RCC, further avelumab abstracts in non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma will be showcased. In addition to avelumab data, Merck will also feature new research at ASCO on its investigational bifunctional immunotherapy anti-PD-L1/TGF-ß trap (M7824), which is thought to simultaneously block both PD-L1 and TGF-ß. An oral presentation will showcase dose escalation Phase I clinical data exploring the potential of M7824 in advanced solid tumors. Pipeline updates at ASCO also include early clinical results for both Tepotinib, an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase, M7583, an oral, highly selective, covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), and the first clinical data for M3814, an investigational DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) inhibitor. Merck is investing significant resources in the promising area of DDR to be a leader in this field. Merck has recently in-licensed two promising clinical-stage programs from Vertex. This highly focused approach to research and development channels Merck's scientific expertise in areas of high unmet need, a legacy started with Erbitux. Multiple presentations at ASCO reinforce Erbitux as a standard-of-care treatment in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), providing valuable information about biomarkers, disease response, and the importance of tumor location in mCRC, to best target treatment to the right patients. *Avelumab is under clinical investigation for treatment of NSCLC, RCC, DLBCL, SSCHN and mCRPC and has not been demonstrated to be safe and effective for these indications. There is no guarantee that avelumab will be approved for NSCLC, RCC, DLBCL, SSCHN and mCRPC by any health authority worldwide. **Tepotinib is the proposed nonproprietary name for the c-Met kinase inhibitor (also known as MSC2156119J). Tepotinib, M7824 and M3814 are under clinical investigation and have not been proven to be safe and effective. There is no guarantee any product will be approved in the sought-after indication by any health authority worldwide. Notes to Editors  Accepted Merck-supported key abstracts slated for presentation are listed below. In addition, a number of investigator-sponsored studies have been accepted, including multiple abstracts related to Erbitux and avelumab (not listed).

About Avelumab  Avelumab is a human antibody specific for a protein called PD-L1, or programmed death ligand-1. Avelumab is designed to potentially engage both the adaptive and innate immune systems. By binding to PD-L1, avelumab is thought to prevent tumor cells from using PD-L1 for protection against white blood cells, such as T-cells, exposing them to anti-tumor responses. Avelumab has been shown to induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro. In November 2014, Merck and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab. ***Indications The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for avelumab (BAVENCIO®) for the treatment of (i) metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older and (ii) patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or who have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. Avelumab is not approved for any indication in any market outside the U.S. Important Safety Information   The warnings and precautions for BAVENCIO include immune-mediated adverse reactions (such as pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis and renal dysfunction and other adverse reactions), infusion-related reactions and embryo-fetal toxicity. Common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) in patients treated with avelumab include fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, nausea, infusion-related reaction, peripheral edema, decreased appetite/hypophagia, urinary tract infection and rash. About Erbitux® (cetuximab)   Erbitux® is a highly active IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). As a monoclonal antibody, the mode of action of Erbitux is distinct from standard non-selective chemotherapy treatments in that it specifically targets and binds to the EGFR. This binding inhibits the activation of the receptor and the subsequent signal-transduction pathway, which results in reducing both the invasion of normal tissues by tumor cells and the spread of tumors to new sites. It is also believed to inhibit the ability of tumor cells to repair the damage caused by chemotherapy and radiotherapy and to inhibit the formation of new blood vessels inside tumors, which appears to lead to an overall suppression of tumor growth. Erbitux also targets cytotoxic immune effector cells towards EGFR expressing tumor cells (antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, ADCC). The most commonly reported side effect with Erbitux is an acne-like skin rash. In approximately 5% of patients, hypersensitivity reactions may occur during treatment with Erbitux; about half of these reactions are severe. Erbitux has already obtained market authorization in over 90 countries world-wide for the treatment of RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer and for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Merck licensed the right to market Erbitux, a registered trademark of ImClone LLC, outside the U.S. and Canada from ImClone LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company, in 1998. About M3814  M3814 is an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). DNA-PK is a key enzyme for non-homologous end-joining (NEHJ), the most important DNA double strand break repair pathway (DSB), and could potentially enhance the efficacy of many commonly used DNA-damaging agents such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy. M3814 complements Merck's extensive DNA damage response (DDR) portfolio and is currently in Phase I studies. About M7824  M7824, anti-PD-L1/TGF-ß trap, is an investigational potentially first-in-class bi-functional immunotherapy designed to simultaneously block two immuno-inhibitory pathways (PD-L1 and transforming growth factor beta) that are commonly used by cancer cells to evade the immune system. The aim of this investigational drug is to control tumor growth by restoring and enhancing anti-tumor immune responses. M7824 is currently in Phase I studies for solid tumors. About Tepotinib  Tepotinib (also known as MSC2156119J) is an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase. Alterations of the c-Met signaling pathway are found in various cancer types and correlate with aggressive tumor behavior and poor clinical prognosis. Tepotinib is currently under evaluation in Phase I/II trials. About Merck   Merck is a leading science and technology company in healthcare, life science and performance materials.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Data for KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Across 16 Types of Cancer from Merck’s Industry-Leading Immuno-Oncology Program to Be Presented at the 2017 ASCO Annual Meeting KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that new and updated data from studies of KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), the company’s anti-PD-1 therapy, will be presented at the 53rd Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in Chicago, June 2 – 6, 2017. At this year’s meeting, researchers will present data from more than 50 abstracts investigating the use of KEYTRUDA as monotherapy and in novel combinations across 16 cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, urothelial carcinoma, microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) cancers, gastric cancer and breast cancer. Additional longer-term progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) data for KEYTRUDA in monotherapy and as a combination therapy in first-line NSCLC from KEYNOTE-024 and KEYNOTE-021G will be presented. As noted in the abstracts, in KEYNOTE-024 significant improvement in OS was maintained with KEYTRUDA compared to chemotherapy with a longer follow-up of approximately six months; and in KEYNOTE-021G with more than five months of additional follow-up, a trend for improved OS with KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin (pem/carbo) was observed when compared to pem/carbo alone, despite high rates of patient cross-over. Additional data on these findings will be presented at the meeting. “Our data at ASCO bring to life the potential of KEYTRUDA across many different cancer types as both monotherapy and in combination, and underscore the remarkable progress that is being made in the fight against cancer,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, Chief Medical Officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “In particular, we continue to show improved survival outcomes in the first-line treatment of both melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, and we highlight clinical collaboration data that explore the potential of novel immunotherapy combinations as a treatment for patients with cancer.” In monotherapy, data for KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) will be presented in NSCLC, melanoma, urothelial carcinoma, gastric cancer and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), among others. In the combination setting, data for KEYTRUDA in NSCLC, TNBC and endometrial cancer, among others, will be presented. Additionally, studies providing insight into the role of biomarkers – such as PD-L1 and microsatellite-instability – across a variety of tumors and treatment settings will be presented. Merck continues to advance the study of genomic markers and signals that can help physicians to identify the treatment regimen that may be best for each patient. Merck Data at the 2017 ASCO Annual Meeting A select listing of the more than 50 Merck-sponsored and collaboration abstracts featuring KEYTRUDA is provided below. Data from studies of other oncology medicines in Merck’s portfolio and pipeline will also be presented at the meeting.

About KEYTRUDA®(pembrolizumab) Injection KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. Studies of KEYTRUDA – from the largest immuno-oncology program in the industry with more than 500 trials – include a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand factors that predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including the exploration of several different biomarkers across a broad range of tumors. KEYTRUDA®(pembrolizumab) Indications and Dosing Melanoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Lung Cancer KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥50%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab), as a single agent, is also indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and progression-free survival. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In metastatic NSCLC, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. When administering KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy, KEYTRUDA should be administered prior to chemotherapy when given on the same day. See also the Prescribing Information for pemetrexed and carboplatin. Head and Neck Cancer KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In HNSCC, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), or who have relapsed after three or more prior lines of therapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In adults with cHL, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. In pediatric patients with cHL, KEYTRUDA is administered at a dose of 2 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 200 mg) every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 94 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%) pneumonitis, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (6.9%) compared to those without (2.9%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 48 (1.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) colitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 19 (0.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%) hepatitis. Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis. Hypophysitis occurred in 17 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%) hypophysitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency). Administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. KEYTRUDA can cause thyroid disorders, including hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and thyroiditis. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 96 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%) hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism occurred in 237 (8.5%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%) hypothyroidism. Thyroiditis occurred in 16 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%) thyroiditis. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. Administer replacement hormones for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. KEYTRUDA can cause type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 9 (0.3%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis. KEYTRUDA can cause other clinically important immune-mediated adverse reactions. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction. The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), exfoliative dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid, rash (1.4%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, and partial seizures arising in a patient with inflammatory foci in brain parenchyma. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and postmarketing use. Solid organ transplant rejection has been reported in postmarketing use of KEYTRUDA. Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider benefit of treatment with KEYTRUDA vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients. KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions, including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after being treated with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA on any trial, 6 patients (26%) developed graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), one of which was fatal, and 2 patients (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning, one of which was fatal. Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody before transplantation. These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute GVHD, severe (Grade 3 to 4) acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic VOD, and other immune-mediated adverse reactions, and intervene promptly. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA monotherapy was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 8% of 682 patients with metastatic NSCLC. The most common adverse event resulting in permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA was pneumonitis (1.8%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 23% of patients; the most common (≥1%) were diarrhea (1%), fatigue (1.3%), pneumonia (1%), liver enzyme elevation (1.2%), decreased appetite (1.3%), and pneumonitis (1%). The most common adverse reactions (occurring in at least 20% of patients and at a higher incidence than with docetaxel) were decreased appetite (25% vs 23%), dyspnea (23% vs 20%), and nausea (20% vs 18%). When KEYTRUDA was administered in combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin, KEYTRUDA was discontinued in 10% of 59 patients. The most common adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of KEYTRUDA (≥2%) was acute kidney injury (3.4%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 39% of patients; the most common (≥2%) were fatigue (8%), neutrophil count decreased (8%), anemia (5%), dyspnea (3.4%), and pneumonitis (3.4%).The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) compared to carbo/pem alone were fatigue (71% vs 50%), nausea (68% vs 56%), constipation (51% vs 37%), rash (42% vs 21%), vomiting (39% vs 27%), dyspnea (39% vs 21%), diarrhea (37% vs 23%), decreased appetite (31% vs. 23%), headache (31% vs 16%), cough (24% vs 18%), dizziness (24%vs 16%), insomnia (24% vs 15%), pruritus (24% vs 4.8%), peripheral edema (22% vs 18%), dysgeusia (20% vs 11%), alopecia (20% vs 3.2%), upper respiratory tract infection (20% vs 3.2%), and arthralgia (15% vs 24%). The study was not designed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in adverse reaction rates for KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy, as compared to chemotherapy alone, for any specified adverse reaction. It is not known whether KEYTRUDA is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, instruct women to discontinue nursing during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the final dose.

Over 40 abstracts showcase the impact of Merck's commitment to shaping cancer care today and tomorrow, including data for avelumab*, which is being developed in collaboration with Pfizer, Erbitux(R) (cetuximab), and pipeline updates on the anti-PD-L1/TGF-ss trap M7824, the DNA-PK inhibitor M3814, the BTK inhibitor M7583, and the c-Met inhibitor tepotinib**. "We are focused on delivering innovation that matters to patients, as shown in our ASCO data that spans across IO and DDR approaches to tackle some of the hardest-to-treat cancers," said Luciano Rossetti, Executive Vice President, Head of Global Research & Development at the biopharma business of Merck. "Merck was among the first to leverage the potential of the PD1/PDL1 pathway for patients, and we continue to build on that progress with our ASCO presence and the two recent FDA accelerated approvals for avelumab." Multiple avelumab presentations at ASCO include data in first-line metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) and previously treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC), as well as results from the Phase Ib trial from the avelumab combination trial with axitinib in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval*** for avelumab for the treatment of mMCC and pretreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC. Avelumab is currently being evaluated as both monotherapy and combination therapy in an extensive clinical development program. Beyond mMCC, locally advanced or metastatic UC and RCC, further avelumab abstracts in non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma will be showcased. In addition to avelumab data, Merck will also feature new research at ASCO on its investigational bifunctional immunotherapy anti-PD-L1/TGF-ss trap (M7824), which is thought to simultaneously block both PD-L1 and TGF-ss. An oral presentation will showcase dose escalation Phase I clinical data exploring the potential of M7824 in advanced solid tumors. Pipeline updates at ASCO also include early clinical results for both Tepotinib, an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase, M7583, an oral, highly selective, covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), and the first clinical data for M3814, an investigational DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) inhibitor. Merck is investing significant resources in the promising area of DDR to be a leader in this field. Merck has recently in-licensed two promising clinical-stage programs from Vertex. This highly focused approach to research and development channels Merck's scientific expertise in areas of high unmet need, a legacy started with Erbitux. Multiple presentations at ASCO reinforce Erbitux as a standard-of-care treatment in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), providing valuable information about biomarkers, disease response, and the importance of tumor location in mCRC, to best target treatment to the right patients. *Avelumab is under clinical investigation for treatment of NSCLC, RCC, DLBCL, SSCHN and mCRPC and has not been demonstrated to be safe and effective for these indications. There is no guarantee that avelumab will be approved for NSCLC, RCC, DLBCL, SSCHN and mCRPC by any health authority worldwide. **Tepotinib is the proposed nonproprietary name for the c-Met kinase inhibitor (also known as MSC2156119J). Tepotinib, M7824 and M3814 are under clinical investigation and have not been proven to be safe and effective. There is no guarantee any product will be approved in the sought-after indication by any health authority worldwide. Notes to Editors  Accepted Merck-supported key abstracts slated for presentation are listed below. In addition, a number of investigator-sponsored studies have been accepted, including multiple abstracts related to Erbitux and avelumab (not listed).

About Avelumab  Avelumab is a human antibody specific for a protein called PD-L1, or programmed death ligand-1. Avelumab is designed to potentially engage both the adaptive and innate immune systems. By binding to PD-L1, avelumab is thought to prevent tumor cells from using PD-L1 for protection against white blood cells, such as T-cells, exposing them to anti-tumor responses. Avelumab has been shown to induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro. In November 2014, Merck and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab. ***Indications The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for avelumab (BAVENCIO(R)) for the treatment of (i) metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older and (ii) patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or who have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. Avelumab is not approved for any indication in any market outside the U.S. Important Safety Information   The warnings and precautions for BAVENCIO include immune-mediated adverse reactions (such as pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis and renal dysfunction and other adverse reactions), infusion-related reactions and embryo-fetal toxicity. Common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) in patients treated with avelumab include fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, nausea, infusion-related reaction, peripheral edema, decreased appetite/hypophagia, urinary tract infection and rash. About Erbitux(R) (cetuximab)   Erbitux(R) is a highly active IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). As a monoclonal antibody, the mode of action of Erbitux is distinct from standard non-selective chemotherapy treatments in that it specifically targets and binds to the EGFR. This binding inhibits the activation of the receptor and the subsequent signal-transduction pathway, which results in reducing both the invasion of normal tissues by tumor cells and the spread of tumors to new sites. It is also believed to inhibit the ability of tumor cells to repair the damage caused by chemotherapy and radiotherapy and to inhibit the formation of new blood vessels inside tumors, which appears to lead to an overall suppression of tumor growth. Erbitux also targets cytotoxic immune effector cells towards EGFR expressing tumor cells (antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, ADCC). The most commonly reported side effect with Erbitux is an acne-like skin rash. In approximately 5% of patients, hypersensitivity reactions may occur during treatment with Erbitux; about half of these reactions are severe. Erbitux has already obtained market authorization in over 90 countries world-wide for the treatment of RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer and for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Merck licensed the right to market Erbitux, a registered trademark of ImClone LLC, outside the U.S. and Canada from ImClone LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company, in 1998. About M3814  M3814 is an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). DNA-PK is a key enzyme for non-homologous end-joining (NEHJ), the most important DNA double strand break repair pathway (DSB), and could potentially enhance the efficacy of many commonly used DNA-damaging agents such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy. M3814 complements Merck's extensive DNA damage response (DDR) portfolio and is currently in Phase I studies. About M7824  M7824, anti-PD-L1/TGF-ss trap, is an investigational potentially first-in-class bi-functional immunotherapy designed to simultaneously block two immuno-inhibitory pathways (PD-L1 and transforming growth factor beta) that are commonly used by cancer cells to evade the immune system. The aim of this investigational drug is to control tumor growth by restoring and enhancing anti-tumor immune responses. M7824 is currently in Phase I studies for solid tumors. About Tepotinib  Tepotinib (also known as MSC2156119J) is an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase. Alterations of the c-Met signaling pathway are found in various cancer types and correlate with aggressive tumor behavior and poor clinical prognosis. Tepotinib is currently under evaluation in Phase I/II trials. About Merck   Merck is a leading science and technology company in healthcare, life science and performance materials.

Merck, KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, is investing significant resources in the promising area of DDR to be a leader in this field. Merck, KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, has recently in-licensed two promising clinical-stage programs from Vertex. This highly focused approach to research and development channels Merck, KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany's scientific expertise in areas of high unmet need, a legacy started with Erbitux. Multiple presentations at ASCO reinforce Erbitux as a standard-of-care treatment in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), providing valuable information about biomarkers, disease response, and the importance of tumor location in mCRC, to best target treatment to the right patients. *Avelumab is under clinical investigation for treatment of NSCLC, RCC, DLBCL, SSCHN and mCRPC and has not been demonstrated to be safe and effective for these indications. There is no guarantee that avelumab will be approved for NSCLC, RCC, DLBCL, SSCHN and mCRPC by any health authority worldwide. **Tepotinib is the proposed nonproprietary name for the c-Met kinase inhibitor (also known as MSC2156119J). Tepotinib, M7824 and M3814 are under clinical investigation and have not been proven to be safe and effective. There is no guarantee any product will be approved in the sought-after indication by any health authority worldwide. Notes to Editors  Accepted Merck, KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany-supported key abstracts slated for presentation are listed below. In addition, a number of investigator-sponsored studies have been accepted, including multiple abstracts related to Erbitux and avelumab (not listed).

Avelumab is designed to potentially engage both the adaptive and innate immune systems. By binding to PD-L1, avelumab is thought to prevent tumor cells from using PD-L1 for protection against white blood cells, such as T-cells, exposing them to anti-tumor responses. Avelumab has been shown to induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro. In November 2014, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab. ***Indications The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for avelumab (BAVENCIO®) for the treatment of (i) metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older and (ii) patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or who have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. Avelumab is not approved for any indication in any market outside the U.S. Important Safety Information   The warnings and precautions for BAVENCIO include immune-mediated adverse reactions (such as pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis and renal dysfunction and other adverse reactions), infusion-related reactions and embryo-fetal toxicity. Common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) in patients treated with avelumab include fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, nausea, infusion-related reaction, peripheral edema, decreased appetite/hypophagia, urinary tract infection and rash. For full prescribing information and medication guide for BAVENCIO, please see http://www.BAVENCIO.com. About Erbitux® (cetuximab)   Erbitux® is a highly active IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). As a monoclonal antibody, the mode of action of Erbitux is distinct from standard non-selective chemotherapy treatments in that it specifically targets and binds to the EGFR. This binding inhibits the activation of the receptor and the subsequent signal-transduction pathway, which results in reducing both the invasion of normal tissues by tumor cells and the spread of tumors to new sites. It is also believed to inhibit the ability of tumor cells to repair the damage caused by chemotherapy and radiotherapy and to inhibit the formation of new blood vessels inside tumors, which appears to lead to an overall suppression of tumor growth. Erbitux also targets cytotoxic immune effector cells towards EGFR expressing tumor cells (antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, ADCC). The most commonly reported side effect with Erbitux is an acne-like skin rash. In approximately 5% of patients, hypersensitivity reactions may occur during treatment with Erbitux; about half of these reactions are severe. Erbitux has already obtained market authorization in over 90 countries world-wide for the treatment of RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer and for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Merck, KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany licensed the right to market Erbitux, a registered trademark of ImClone LLC, outside the U.S. and Canada from ImClone LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company, in 1998. About M3814  M3814 is an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). DNA-PK is a key enzyme for non-homologous end-joining (NEHJ), the most important DNA double strand break repair pathway (DSB), and could potentially enhance the efficacy of many commonly used DNA-damaging agents such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy. M3814 complements Merck, KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany's extensive DNA damage response (DDR) portfolio and is currently in Phase I studies. About M7824  M7824, anti-PD-L1/TGF-ß trap, is an investigational potentially first-in-class bi-functional immunotherapy designed to simultaneously block two immuno-inhibitory pathways (PD-L1 and transforming growth factor beta) that are commonly used by cancer cells to evade the immune system. The aim of this investigational drug is to control tumor growth by restoring and enhancing anti-tumor immune responses. M7824 is currently in Phase I studies for solid tumors. About Tepotinib  Tepotinib (also known as MSC2156119J) is an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase. Alterations of the c-Met signaling pathway are found in various cancer types and correlate with aggressive tumor behavior and poor clinical prognosis. Tepotinib is currently under evaluation in Phase I/II trials. About Merck, KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany   Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, is a leading science and technology company in healthcare, life science and performance materials.

Over 40 abstracts showcase the impact of Merck’s commitment to shaping cancer care today and tomorrow, including data for avelumab*, which is being developed in collaboration with Pfizer, Erbitux® (cetuximab), and pipeline updates on the anti-PD-L1/TGF-ß trap M7824, the DNA-PK inhibitor M3814, the BTK inhibitor M7583, and the c-Met inhibitor tepotinib**. “We are focused on delivering innovation that matters to patients, as shown in our ASCO data that spans across IO and DDR approaches to tackle some of the hardest-to-treat cancers,” said Luciano Rossetti, Executive Vice President, Head of Global Research & Development at the biopharma business of Merck. “Merck was among the first to leverage the potential of the PD1/PDL1 pathway for patients, and we continue to build on that progress with our ASCO presence and the two recent FDA accelerated approvals for avelumab.” Multiple avelumab presentations at ASCO include data in first-line metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) and previously treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC), as well as results from the Phase Ib trial from the avelumab combination trial with axitinib in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval*** for avelumab for the treatment of mMCC and pretreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC. Avelumab is currently being evaluated as both monotherapy and combination therapy in an extensive clinical development program. Beyond mMCC, locally advanced or metastatic UC and RCC, further avelumab abstracts in non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma will be showcased. In addition to avelumab data, Merck will also feature new research at ASCO on its investigational bifunctional immunotherapy anti-PD-L1/TGF-ß trap (M7824), which is thought to simultaneously block both PD-L1 and TGF-ß. An oral presentation will showcase dose escalation Phase I clinical data exploring the potential of M7824 in advanced solid tumors. Pipeline updates at ASCO also include early clinical results for both Tepotinib, an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase, M7583, an oral, highly selective, covalent inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK), and the first clinical data for M3814, an investigational DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) inhibitor. Merck is investing significant resources in the promising area of DDR to be a leader in this field. Merck has recently in-licensed two promising clinical-stage programs from Vertex. This highly focused approach to research and development channels Merck’s scientific expertise in areas of high unmet need, a legacy started with Erbitux. Multiple presentations at ASCO reinforce Erbitux as a standard-of-care treatment in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), providing valuable information about biomarkers, disease response, and the importance of tumor location in mCRC, to best target treatment to the right patients. *Avelumab is under clinical investigation for treatment of NSCLC, RCC, DLBCL, SSCHN and mCRPC and has not been demonstrated to be safe and effective for these indications. There is no guarantee that avelumab will be approved for NSCLC, RCC, DLBCL, SSCHN and mCRPC by any health authority worldwide. **Tepotinib is the proposed nonproprietary name for the c-Met kinase inhibitor (also known as MSC2156119J). Tepotinib, M7824 and M3814 are under clinical investigation and have not been proven to be safe and effective. There is no guarantee any product will be approved in the sought-after indication by any health authority worldwide. Notes to Editors  Accepted Merck-supported key abstracts slated for presentation are listed below. In addition, a number of investigator-sponsored studies have been accepted, including multiple abstracts related to Erbitux and avelumab (not listed).

About Avelumab  Avelumab is a human antibody specific for a protein called PD-L1, or programmed death ligand-1. Avelumab is designed to potentially engage both the adaptive and innate immune systems. By binding to PD-L1, avelumab is thought to prevent tumor cells from using PD-L1 for protection against white blood cells, such as T-cells, exposing them to anti-tumor responses. Avelumab has been shown to induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro. In November 2014, Merck and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab. ***Indications The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for avelumab (BAVENCIO®) for the treatment of (i) metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older and (ii) patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or who have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. Avelumab is not approved for any indication in any market outside the U.S. Important Safety Information   The warnings and precautions for BAVENCIO include immune-mediated adverse reactions (such as pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis and renal dysfunction and other adverse reactions), infusion-related reactions and embryo-fetal toxicity. Common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) in patients treated with avelumab include fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, nausea, infusion-related reaction, peripheral edema, decreased appetite/hypophagia, urinary tract infection and rash. About Erbitux® (cetuximab)   Erbitux® is a highly active IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). As a monoclonal antibody, the mode of action of Erbitux is distinct from standard non-selective chemotherapy treatments in that it specifically targets and binds to the EGFR. This binding inhibits the activation of the receptor and the subsequent signal-transduction pathway, which results in reducing both the invasion of normal tissues by tumor cells and the spread of tumors to new sites. It is also believed to inhibit the ability of tumor cells to repair the damage caused by chemotherapy and radiotherapy and to inhibit the formation of new blood vessels inside tumors, which appears to lead to an overall suppression of tumor growth. Erbitux also targets cytotoxic immune effector cells towards EGFR expressing tumor cells (antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, ADCC). The most commonly reported side effect with Erbitux is an acne-like skin rash. In approximately 5% of patients, hypersensitivity reactions may occur during treatment with Erbitux; about half of these reactions are severe. Erbitux has already obtained market authorization in over 90 countries world-wide for the treatment of RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer and for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Merck licensed the right to market Erbitux, a registered trademark of ImClone LLC, outside the U.S. and Canada from ImClone LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company, in 1998. About M3814  M3814 is an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). DNA-PK is a key enzyme for non-homologous end-joining (NEHJ), the most important DNA double strand break repair pathway (DSB), and could potentially enhance the efficacy of many commonly used DNA-damaging agents such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy. M3814 complements Merck’s extensive DNA damage response (DDR) portfolio and is currently in Phase I studies. About M7824  M7824, anti-PD-L1/TGF-ß trap, is an investigational potentially first-in-class bi-functional immunotherapy designed to simultaneously block two immuno-inhibitory pathways (PD-L1 and transforming growth factor beta) that are commonly used by cancer cells to evade the immune system. The aim of this investigational drug is to control tumor growth by restoring and enhancing anti-tumor immune responses. M7824 is currently in Phase I studies for solid tumors. About Tepotinib  Tepotinib (also known as MSC2156119J) is an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase. Alterations of the c-Met signaling pathway are found in various cancer types and correlate with aggressive tumor behavior and poor clinical prognosis. Tepotinib is currently under evaluation in Phase I/II trials. About Merck   Merck is a leading science and technology company in healthcare, life science and performance materials.

News provided by Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany 17 May, 2017, 17:00 ET Share this article DARMSTADT, Germany and NEW YORK, May 17, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- A total of 13 abstracts across seven hard-to-treat cancers highlight the progress of avelumab as a monotherapy and potential novel combination treatment option   New data in metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma and previously treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma, following recent US FDA accelerated approvals  Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Pfizer today announced that 13 avelumab* abstracts across seven challenging tumor types will be featured at the 53rd American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting held June 2-6, 2017 in Chicago, IL. Key presentations include data for avelumab in first-line metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) and in previously treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC), as well as results from the Phase Ib trial investigating avelumab in combination with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib, in advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).      (Logo: http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/512993/Merck_KGaA_Pfizer_Logo.jpg ) "Our ASCO presence adds to what has already been a momentous year for the alliance, coming shortly after the US FDA granted two accelerated approvals for avelumab," said Luciano Rossetti, M.D., Executive Vice President, Global Head of Research & Development at the biopharma business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, which in the US and Canada operates as EMD Serono. "We're particularly excited to share the latest avelumab data in both metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma in the first-line setting and previously treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma with the cancer community." "Our data at ASCO this year underscore the potential of avelumab as a monotherapy treatment, as well as part of combination regimens," said Chris Boshoff, M.D., PhD, Senior Vice President and Head of Immuno-Oncology, Early Development, Translational Oncology, Pfizer Global Product Development. "Now with accelerated approvals in two indications for avelumab in the US, we are entering the next chapter of our clinical development program to provide meaningful new treatment options for patients who need them most." Highlights of avelumab data at ASCO 2017 include the following: Preliminary data from the ongoing JAVELIN Merkel 200 trial, an open-label, multicenter study conducted in first-line mMCC investigating avelumab in patients who had no prior systemic treatment for mMCC, will be presented for the first time at a medical congress. Data from a pooled analysis of two metastatic UC cohorts of the JAVELIN Solid Tumor trial, a Phase Ib, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study of avelumab in the treatment of various solid tumors, will be presented. An oral presentation of results from the JAVELIN Renal 100 trial, a Phase Ib, open-label study evaluating the clinical activity and safety of the combination of avelumab and axitinib for the first-line treatment of advanced RCC. Beyond mMCC, metastatic UC and advanced RCC, the alliance between Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Pfizer will also showcase avelumab abstracts in non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, as well as updated pooled safety data in solid tumors. The alliance's JAVELIN clinical development program now involves at least 30 clinical programs, including nine Phase III trials, and more than 5,200 patients across more than 15 tumor types. Results from JAVELIN program trials have supported two FDA accelerated approvals in 2017. A list of accepted avelumab abstracts is included below. The abstracts are also available on the ASCO website.

 *Avelumab is under clinical investigation for treatment of NSCLC, RCC, DLBCL, SSCHN and mCRPC and has not been demonstrated to be safe and effective for these indications. There is no guarantee that avelumab will be approved for NSCLC, RCC, DLBCL, SSCHN and mCRPC by any health authority worldwide. About Avelumab  Avelumab is a human antibody specific for a protein called PD-L1, or programmed death ligand-1. Avelumab is designed to potentially engage both the adaptive and innate immune systems. By binding to PD-L1, avelumab is thought to prevent tumor cells from using PD-L1 for protection against white blood cells, such as T-cells, exposing them to anti-tumor responses. Avelumab has been shown to induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro. In November 2014, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab. Indications   The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for avelumab (BAVENCIO®) for the treatment of (i) metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older and (ii) patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or who have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. Avelumab is not approved for any indication in any market outside the US. Important Safety Information   The warnings and precautions for BAVENCIO include immune-mediated adverse reactions (such as pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis and renal dysfunction and other adverse reactions), infusion-related reactions and embryo-fetal toxicity. Common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) in patients treated with avelumab include fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, nausea, infusion-related reaction, peripheral edema, decreased appetite/hypophagia, urinary tract infection and rash. For full prescribing information and medication guide for BAVENCIO, please see http://www.BAVENCIO.com. Alliance between Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Pfizer Inc., New York, US   Immuno-oncology is a top priority for Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Pfizer Inc. The global strategic alliance between Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Pfizer Inc., New York, US, enables the companies to benefit from each other's strengths and capabilities and further explore the therapeutic potential of avelumab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody initially discovered and developed by Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. The immuno-oncology alliance will jointly develop and commercialize avelumab and advance Pfizer's PD-1 antibody. The alliance is focused on developing high-priority international clinical programs to investigate avelumab as a monotherapy, as well as in combination regimens, and is striving to find new ways to treat cancer.

Key presentations include data for avelumab in first-line metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) and in previously treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC), as well as results from the Phase Ib trial investigating avelumab in combination with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib, in advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). (Logo: http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/477506/Merck_Pfizer_Logo.jpg ) "Our ASCO presence adds to what has already been a momentous year for the alliance, coming shortly after the US FDA granted two accelerated approvals for avelumab," said Luciano Rossetti, M.D., Executive Vice President, Global Head of Research & Development at the biopharma business of Merck, which in the US and Canada operates as EMD Serono. "We're particularly excited to share the latest avelumab data in both metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma in the first-line setting and previously treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma with the cancer community." "Our data at ASCO this year underscore the potential of avelumab as a monotherapy treatment, as well as part of combination regimens," said Chris Boshoff, M.D., PhD, Senior Vice President and Head of Immuno-Oncology, Early Development, Translational Oncology, Pfizer Global Product Development. "Now with accelerated approvals in two indications for avelumab in the US, we are entering the next chapter of our clinical development program to provide meaningful new treatment options for patients who need them most." Highlights of avelumab data at ASCO 2017 include the following: - Preliminary data from the ongoing JAVELIN Merkel 200 trial, an open-label, multicenter study conducted in first-line mMCC investigating avelumab in patients who had no prior systemic treatment for mMCC, will be presented for the first time at a medical congress. - Data from a pooled analysis of two metastatic UC cohorts of the JAVELIN Solid Tumor trial, a Phase Ib, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study of avelumab in the treatment of various solid tumors, will be presented. - An oral presentation of results from the JAVELIN Renal 100 trial, a Phase Ib, open-label study evaluating the clinical activity and safety of the combination of avelumab and axitinib for the first-line treatment of advanced RCC. - Beyond mMCC, metastatic UC and RCC, the Merck-Pfizer Alliance will also showcase avelumab abstracts in non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, as well as updated safety data in solid tumors. The alliance's rapidly accelerating JAVELIN clinical development program now involves at least 30 clinical programs, including nine Phase III trials, and more than 5,200 patients across more than 15 tumor types. Results from JAVELIN program trials have supported two FDA accelerated approvals in 2017. A list of accepted avelumab abstracts is included below. The abstracts are also available on the ASCO website [https://am.asco.org ].

There is no guarantee that avelumab will be approved for NSCLC, RCC, DLBCL, SSCHN and mCRPC by any health authority worldwide. About Avelumab  Avelumab is a human antibody specific for a protein called PD-L1, or programmed death ligand-1. Avelumab is designed to potentially engage both the adaptive and innate immune systems. By binding to PD-L1, avelumab is thought to prevent tumor cells from using PD-L1 for protection against white blood cells, such as T-cells, exposing them to anti-tumor responses. Avelumab has been shown to induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro. In November 2014, Merck and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab. Indications   The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for avelumab (BAVENCIO(R)) for the treatment of (i) metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older and (ii) patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or who have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. Avelumab is not approved for any indication in any market outside the US. Important Safety Information   The warnings and precautions for BAVENCIO include immune-mediated adverse reactions (such as pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis and renal dysfunction and other adverse reactions), infusion-related reactions and embryo-fetal toxicity. Common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) in patients treated with avelumab include fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, nausea, infusion-related reaction, peripheral edema, decreased appetite/hypophagia, urinary tract infection and rash. About the Merck-Pfizer Alliance  Immuno-oncology is a top priority for Merck and Pfizer Inc. The global strategic alliance between Merck and Pfizer enables the companies to benefit from each other's strengths and capabilities and further explore the therapeutic potential of avelumab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody initially discovered and developed by Merck. The immuno-oncology alliance will jointly develop and commercialize avelumab and advance Pfizer's PD-1 antibody. The alliance is focused on developing high-priority international clinical programs to investigate avelumab as a monotherapy, as well as in combination regimens, and is striving to find new ways to treat cancer.

Over 40 abstracts showcase the impact of Merck's commitment to shaping cancer care today and tomorrow, including data for avelumab*, which is being developed in collaboration with Pfizer, Erbitux® (cetuximab), and pipeline updates on the anti-PD-L1/TGF-ß trap M7824, the DNA-PK inhibitor M3814, the BTK inhibitor M7583, and the c-Met inhibitor tepotinib**. "We are focused on delivering innovation that matters to patients, as shown in our ASCO data that spans across IO and DDR approaches to tackle some of the hardest-to-treat cancers," said Luciano Rossetti, Executive Vice President, Head of Global Research & Development at the biopharma business of Merck. "Merck was among the first to leverage the potential of the PD1/PDL1 pathway for patients, and we continue to build on that progress with our ASCO presence and the two recent FDA accelerated approvals for avelumab." Multiple avelumab presentations at ASCO include data in first-line metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) and previously treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC), as well as results from the Phase Ib trial from the avelumab combination trial with axitinib in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval*** for avelumab for the treatment of mMCC and pretreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC. Avelumab is currently being evaluated as both monotherapy and combination therapy in an extensive clinical development program. Beyond mMCC, locally advanced or metastatic UC and RCC, further avelumab abstracts in non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma will be showcased. In addition to avelumab data, Merck will also feature new research at ASCO on its investigational bifunctional immunotherapy anti-PD-L1/TGF-ß trap (M7824), which is thought to simultaneously block both PD-L1 and TGF-ß. An oral presentation will showcase dose escalation Phase I clinical data exploring the potential of M7824 in advanced solid tumors. Pipeline updates at ASCO also include early clinical results for both Tepotinib, an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase, M7583, an oral, highly selective, covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), and the first clinical data for M3814, an investigational DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) inhibitor. Merck is investing significant resources in the promising area of DDR to be a leader in this field. Merck has recently in-licensed two promising clinical-stage programs from Vertex. This highly focused approach to research and development channels Merck's scientific expertise in areas of high unmet need, a legacy started with Erbitux. Multiple presentations at ASCO reinforce Erbitux as a standard-of-care treatment in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), providing valuable information about biomarkers, disease response, and the importance of tumor location in mCRC, to best target treatment to the right patients. *Avelumab is under clinical investigation for treatment of NSCLC, RCC, DLBCL, SSCHN and mCRPC and has not been demonstrated to be safe and effective for these indications. There is no guarantee that avelumab will be approved for NSCLC, RCC, DLBCL, SSCHN and mCRPC by any health authority worldwide. **Tepotinib is the proposed nonproprietary name for the c-Met kinase inhibitor (also known as MSC2156119J). Tepotinib, M7824 and M3814 are under clinical investigation and have not been proven to be safe and effective. There is no guarantee any product will be approved in the sought-after indication by any health authority worldwide.

About Avelumab Avelumab is a human antibody specific for a protein called PD-L1, or programmed death ligand-1. Avelumab is designed to potentially engage both the adaptive and innate immune systems. By binding to PD-L1, avelumab is thought to prevent tumor cells from using PD-L1 for protection against white blood cells, such as T-cells, exposing them to anti-tumor responses. Avelumab has been shown to induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro. In November 2014, Merck and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab. ***Indications The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for avelumab (BAVENCIO®) for the treatment of (i) metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older and (ii) patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or who have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. Avelumab is not approved for any indication in any market outside the U.S. Important Safety Information The warnings and precautions for BAVENCIO include immune-mediated adverse reactions (such as pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis and renal dysfunction and other adverse reactions), infusion-related reactions and embryo-fetal toxicity. Common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) in patients treated with avelumab include fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, nausea, infusion-related reaction, peripheral edema, decreased appetite/hypophagia, urinary tract infection and rash. About Erbitux® (cetuximab) Erbitux® is a highly active IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). As a monoclonal antibody, the mode of action of Erbitux is distinct from standard non-selective chemotherapy treatments in that it specifically targets and binds to the EGFR. This binding inhibits the activation of the receptor and the subsequent signal-transduction pathway, which results in reducing both the invasion of normal tissues by tumor cells and the spread of tumors to new sites. It is also believed to inhibit the ability of tumor cells to repair the damage caused by chemotherapy and radiotherapy and to inhibit the formation of new blood vessels inside tumors, which appears to lead to an overall suppression of tumor growth. Erbitux also targets cytotoxic immune effector cells towards EGFR expressing tumor cells (antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, ADCC). The most commonly reported side effect with Erbitux is an acne-like skin rash. In approximately 5% of patients, hypersensitivity reactions may occur during treatment with Erbitux; about half of these reactions are severe. Erbitux has already obtained market authorization in over 90 countries world-wide for the treatment of RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer and for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Merck licensed the right to market Erbitux, a registered trademark of ImClone LLC, outside the U.S. and Canada from ImClone LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company, in 1998. About M3814 M3814 is an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). DNA-PK is a key enzyme for non-homologous end-joining (NEHJ), the most important DNA double strand break repair pathway (DSB), and could potentially enhance the efficacy of many commonly used DNA-damaging agents such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy. M3814 complements Merck's extensive DNA damage response (DDR) portfolio and is currently in Phase I studies. About M7824 M7824, anti-PD-L1/TGF-ß trap, is an investigational potentially first-in-class bi-functional immunotherapy designed to simultaneously block two immuno-inhibitory pathways (PD-L1 and transforming growth factor beta) that are commonly used by cancer cells to evade the immune system. The aim of this investigational drug is to control tumor growth by restoring and enhancing anti-tumor immune responses. M7824 is currently in Phase I studies for solid tumors. About Tepotinib Tepotinib (also known as MSC2156119J) is an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase. Alterations of the c-Met signaling pathway are found in various cancer types and correlate with aggressive tumor behavior and poor clinical prognosis. Tepotinib is currently under evaluation in Phase I/II trials. About Merck Merck is a leading science and technology company in healthcare, life science and performance materials.

Key presentations include data for avelumab in first-line metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) and in previously treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC), as well as results from the Phase Ib trial investigating avelumab in combination with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib, in advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). (Logo: http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/477506/Merck_Pfizer_Logo.jpg ) "Our ASCO presence adds to what has already been a momentous year for the alliance, coming shortly after the US FDA granted two accelerated approvals for avelumab," said Luciano Rossetti, M.D., Executive Vice President, Global Head of Research & Development at the biopharma business of Merck, which in the US and Canada operates as EMD Serono. "We're particularly excited to share the latest avelumab data in both metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma in the first-line setting and previously treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma with the cancer community." "Our data at ASCO this year underscore the potential of avelumab as a monotherapy treatment, as well as part of combination regimens," said Chris Boshoff, M.D., PhD, Senior Vice President and Head of Immuno-Oncology, Early Development, Translational Oncology, Pfizer Global Product Development. "Now with accelerated approvals in two indications for avelumab in the US, we are entering the next chapter of our clinical development program to provide meaningful new treatment options for patients who need them most." Highlights of avelumab data at ASCO 2017 include the following: Preliminary data from the ongoing JAVELIN Merkel 200 trial, an open-label, multicenter study conducted in first-line mMCC investigating avelumab in patients who had no prior systemic treatment for mMCC, will be presented for the first time at a medical congress. Data from a pooled analysis of two metastatic UC cohorts of the JAVELIN Solid Tumor trial, a Phase Ib, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study of avelumab in the treatment of various solid tumors, will be presented. An oral presentation of results from the JAVELIN Renal 100 trial, a Phase Ib, open-label study evaluating the clinical activity and safety of the combination of avelumab and axitinib for the first-line treatment of advanced RCC. Beyond mMCC, metastatic UC and RCC, the Merck-Pfizer Alliance will also showcase avelumab abstracts in non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, as well as updated safety data in solid tumors. The alliance's rapidly accelerating JAVELIN clinical development program now involves at least 30 clinical programs, including nine Phase III trials, and more than 5,200 patients across more than 15 tumor types. Results from JAVELIN program trials have supported two FDA accelerated approvals in 2017. A list of accepted avelumab abstracts is included below. The abstracts are also available on the ASCO website (https://am.asco.org/).

Key presentations include data for avelumab in first-line metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) and in previously treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC), as well as results from the Phase Ib trial investigating avelumab in combination with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib, in advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). (Logo: http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/477506/Merck_Pfizer_Logo.jpg ) "Our ASCO presence adds to what has already been a momentous year for the alliance, coming shortly after the US FDA granted two accelerated approvals for avelumab," said Luciano Rossetti, M.D., Executive Vice President, Global Head of Research & Development at the biopharma business of Merck, which in the US and Canada operates as EMD Serono. "We're particularly excited to share the latest avelumab data in both metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma in the first-line setting and previously treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma with the cancer community." "Our data at ASCO this year underscore the potential of avelumab as a monotherapy treatment, as well as part of combination regimens," said Chris Boshoff, M.D., PhD, Senior Vice President and Head of Immuno-Oncology, Early Development, Translational Oncology, Pfizer Global Product Development. "Now with accelerated approvals in two indications for avelumab in the US, we are entering the next chapter of our clinical development program to provide meaningful new treatment options for patients who need them most." Highlights of avelumab data at ASCO 2017 include the following: - Preliminary data from the ongoing JAVELIN Merkel 200 trial, an open-label, multicenter study conducted in first-line mMCC investigating avelumab in patients who had no prior systemic treatment for mMCC, will be presented for the first time at a medical congress. - Data from a pooled analysis of two metastatic UC cohorts of the JAVELIN Solid Tumor trial, a Phase Ib, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study of avelumab in the treatment of various solid tumors, will be presented. - An oral presentation of results from the JAVELIN Renal 100 trial, a Phase Ib, open-label study evaluating the clinical activity and safety of the combination of avelumab and axitinib for the first-line treatment of advanced RCC. - Beyond mMCC, metastatic UC and RCC, the Merck-Pfizer Alliance will also showcase avelumab abstracts in non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, as well as updated safety data in solid tumors. The alliance's rapidly accelerating JAVELIN clinical development program now involves at least 30 clinical programs, including nine Phase III trials, and more than 5,200 patients across more than 15 tumor types. Results from JAVELIN program trials have supported two FDA accelerated approvals in 2017. A list of accepted avelumab abstracts is included below. The abstracts are also available on the ASCO website [https://am.asco.org ].

There is no guarantee that avelumab will be approved for NSCLC, RCC, DLBCL, SSCHN and mCRPC by any health authority worldwide. About Avelumab  Avelumab is a human antibody specific for a protein called PD-L1, or programmed death ligand-1. Avelumab is designed to potentially engage both the adaptive and innate immune systems. By binding to PD-L1, avelumab is thought to prevent tumor cells from using PD-L1 for protection against white blood cells, such as T-cells, exposing them to anti-tumor responses. Avelumab has been shown to induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro. In November 2014, Merck and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab. Indications   The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for avelumab (BAVENCIO(R)) for the treatment of (i) metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older and (ii) patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or who have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. Avelumab is not approved for any indication in any market outside the US. Important Safety Information   The warnings and precautions for BAVENCIO include immune-mediated adverse reactions (such as pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis and renal dysfunction and other adverse reactions), infusion-related reactions and embryo-fetal toxicity. Common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) in patients treated with avelumab include fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, nausea, infusion-related reaction, peripheral edema, decreased appetite/hypophagia, urinary tract infection and rash. About the Merck-Pfizer Alliance  Immuno-oncology is a top priority for Merck and Pfizer Inc. The global strategic alliance between Merck and Pfizer enables the companies to benefit from each other's strengths and capabilities and further explore the therapeutic potential of avelumab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody initially discovered and developed by Merck. The immuno-oncology alliance will jointly develop and commercialize avelumab and advance Pfizer's PD-1 antibody. The alliance is focused on developing high-priority international clinical programs to investigate avelumab as a monotherapy, as well as in combination regimens, and is striving to find new ways to treat cancer.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Merck’s Glucophage® SR Receives Label Extension for Patients at High Risk of Type 2 Diabetes in the UK DARMSTADT, Germany, May 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Not intended for U.S. based media  Glucophage® SR offers UK healthcare professionals the first licensed treatment option for overweight adult patients at high risk of progression to type 2 diabetes, after failure of intensive lifestyle changes  Non-diabetic hyperglycemia, also known as impaired glucose regulation or pre-diabetes[1], was estimated in 2009 to affect around seven million adults in the UK[2] and is predicted to significantly increase in the coming years[3]  Merck, a leading science and technology company, today announced that the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK has authorized Glucophage® SR (sustained release formulation; metformin), for the reduction in the risk or delay of the onset of type 2 diabetes in adult, overweight patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and/or impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and/or increased glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), when intensive lifestyle changes for 3 to 6 months have failed. This condition is referred to by a variety of names in medical guidelines, i.e. as non-diabetic hyperglycemia, as impaired glucose regulation, or as pre-diabetes.[1],[4]-[7] Merck has already received authorization for this indication in several countries around the world. Through earlier intervention, patients can reduce their risk of developing type 2 diabetes[8] as well as complications that can lead to serious health issues.[5] "We are pleased that patients at risk of diabetes in the UK now have a medicinal treatment option to help them delay the onset of diabetes, when intensive lifestyle changes alone are not enough to work against the progression to type 2 diabetes," said Luciano Rossetti MD, Executive Vice President, Global Head of Research & Development at the biopharma business of Merck: "According to WHO, diabetes is considered a global pandemic and we are committed to helping slow the rapidly growing incidence. This is an important achievement as it can help play a role in reducing the burden of type 2 diabetes for patients." The authorization is based on clinical data on the efficacy of Glucophage® for the treatment of non-diabetic hyperglycemia, primarily gathered in the large US Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)[8] and subsequent Diabetes Prevention Program Outcome Study (DPPOS)[9]-[11] with Glucophage®. This data was complemented by comprehensive safety and efficacy data on Glucophage® collected since its first use in patients in 1957. Non-diabetic hyperglycemia is triggered by insulin resistance, that causes cells to be unable to effectively utilize insulin, which is needed to get the glucose inside the cells and to stabilize blood glucose levels. This is also called impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). As a response, more insulin may be produced, which may again lose efficacy over time. Eventually, blood glucose levels in the body rise to higher than normal values even between meals, which is called impaired fasting glucose (IFG). Elevated blood glucose levels are also often measured as an average over time through HbA1c. The corresponding lab values for diagnosis of non-diabetic hyperglycemia as per UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, are fasting glucose between 100 and 125 mg/dl, and/or 140 to 199mg/dl in a glucose tolerance test, and/or HbA1c between 6.0 and 6.4%.[1] From this stage of non-diabetic hyperglycemia, the disease may then further slowly progress to overt type 2 diabetes. Intensive lifestyle changes will be used as a first counter action. If the patient is still at high risk of progression to type 2 diabetes after 3 to 6 months with worsening glycemic control despite intensive lifestyle measures, Glucophage® SR is now an additional treatment option that may help to slow the deterioration of the blood glucose levels. Treatment with Glucophage® SR must be based on a risk score incorporating appropriate measures of glycemic control and including evidence of high cardiovascular risk. A benefit in the reduction of risk or delay of the onset of type 2 diabetes has not yet been established in patients 75 years and older. About Glucophage®  Glucophage® (metformin hydrochloride) is a prescription-only medicine indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, particularly in overweight patients when diet and exercise alone have failed. In adults, Glucophage® may be given alone or with oral antidiabetic agents, or with insulin. The most commonly reported side effects with Glucophage® SR are gastro-intestinal disturbances that may occur during treatment initiation and resolve spontaneously in most cases. The Glucophage® product portfolio comprises: Glucophage® IR (immediate release formulation) and Glucophage® SR (sustained release formulation). Outside of the UK, Glucophage® SR is known as Glucophage® XR (extended release). In addition, Merck produces Glucovance® a fixed dose combination of metformin and glibenclamide.

This condition is referred to by a variety of names in medical guidelines, i.e. as non-diabetic hyperglycemia, as impaired glucose regulation, or as pre-diabetes.[1],[4]-[7] Merck has already received authorization for this indication in several countries around the world. Through earlier intervention, patients can reduce their risk of developing type 2 diabetes[8] as well as complications that can lead to serious health issues.[5] "We are pleased that patients at risk of diabetes in the UK now have a medicinal treatment option to help them delay the onset of diabetes, when intensive lifestyle changes alone are not enough to work against the progression to type 2 diabetes," said Luciano Rossetti MD, Executive Vice President, Global Head of Research & Development at the biopharma business of Merck: "According to WHO, diabetes is considered a global pandemic and we are committed to helping slow the rapidly growing incidence. This is an important achievement as it can help play a role in reducing the burden of type 2 diabetes for patients." The authorization is based on clinical data on the efficacy of Glucophage(R) for the treatment of non-diabetic hyperglycemia, primarily gathered in the large US Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)[8] and subsequent Diabetes Prevention Program Outcome Study (DPPOS)[9]-[11] with Glucophage(R). This data was complemented by comprehensive safety and efficacy data on Glucophage(R) collected since its first use in patients in 1957. Non-diabetic hyperglycemia is triggered by insulin resistance, that causes cells to be unable to effectively utilize insulin, which is needed to get the glucose inside the cells and to stabilize blood glucose levels. This is also called impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). As a response, more insulin may be produced, which may again lose efficacy over time. Eventually, blood glucose levels in the body rise to higher than normal values even between meals, which is called impaired fasting glucose (IFG). Elevated blood glucose levels are also often measured as an average over time through HbA1c. The corresponding lab values for diagnosis of non-diabetic hyperglycemia as per UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, are fasting glucose between 100 and 125 mg/dl, and/or 140 to 199mg/dl in a glucose tolerance test, and/or HbA1c between 6.0 and 6.4%.[1] From this stage of non-diabetic hyperglycemia, the disease may then further slowly progress to overt type 2 diabetes. Intensive lifestyle changes will be used as a first counter action. If the patient is still at high risk of progression to type 2 diabetes after 3 to 6 months with worsening glycemic control despite intensive lifestyle measures, Glucophage(R) SR is now an additional treatment option that may help to slow the deterioration of the blood glucose levels. Treatment with Glucophage(R) SR must be based on a risk score incorporating appropriate measures of glycemic control and including evidence of high cardiovascular risk. A benefit in the reduction of risk or delay of the onset of type 2 diabetes has not yet been established in patients 75 years and older. About Glucophage(R)  Glucophage(R) (metformin hydrochloride) is a prescription-only medicine indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, particularly in overweight patients when diet and exercise alone have failed. In adults, Glucophage(R) may be given alone or with oral antidiabetic agents, or with insulin. The most commonly reported side effects with Glucophage(R) SR are gastro-intestinal disturbances that may occur during treatment initiation and resolve spontaneously in most cases. The Glucophage(R) product portfolio comprises: Glucophage(R) IR (immediate release formulation) and Glucophage(R) SR (sustained release formulation). Outside of the UK, Glucophage(R) SR is known as Glucophage(R) XR (extended release). In addition, Merck produces Glucovance(R) a fixed dose combination of metformin and glibenclamide.

This condition is referred to by a variety of names in medical guidelines, i.e. as non-diabetic hyperglycemia, as impaired glucose regulation, or as pre-diabetes.[1],[4]-[7] Merck has already received authorization for this indication in several countries around the world. Through earlier intervention, patients can reduce their risk of developing type 2 diabetes[8] as well as complications that can lead to serious health issues.[5] "We are pleased that patients at risk of diabetes in the UK now have a medicinal treatment option to help them delay the onset of diabetes, when intensive lifestyle changes alone are not enough to work against the progression to type 2 diabetes," said Luciano Rossetti MD, Executive Vice President, Global Head of Research & Development at the biopharma business of Merck: "According to WHO, diabetes is considered a global pandemic and we are committed to helping slow the rapidly growing incidence. This is an important achievement as it can help play a role in reducing the burden of type 2 diabetes for patients." The authorization is based on clinical data on the efficacy of Glucophage(R) for the treatment of non-diabetic hyperglycemia, primarily gathered in the large US Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)[8] and subsequent Diabetes Prevention Program Outcome Study (DPPOS)[9]-[11] with Glucophage(R). This data was complemented by comprehensive safety and efficacy data on Glucophage(R) collected since its first use in patients in 1957. Non-diabetic hyperglycemia is triggered by insulin resistance, that causes cells to be unable to effectively utilize insulin, which is needed to get the glucose inside the cells and to stabilize blood glucose levels. This is also called impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). As a response, more insulin may be produced, which may again lose efficacy over time. Eventually, blood glucose levels in the body rise to higher than normal values even between meals, which is called impaired fasting glucose (IFG). Elevated blood glucose levels are also often measured as an average over time through HbA1c. The corresponding lab values for diagnosis of non-diabetic hyperglycemia as per UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, are fasting glucose between 100 and 125 mg/dl, and/or 140 to 199mg/dl in a glucose tolerance test, and/or HbA1c between 6.0 and 6.4%.[1] From this stage of non-diabetic hyperglycemia, the disease may then further slowly progress to overt type 2 diabetes. Intensive lifestyle changes will be used as a first counter action. If the patient is still at high risk of progression to type 2 diabetes after 3 to 6 months with worsening glycemic control despite intensive lifestyle measures, Glucophage(R) SR is now an additional treatment option that may help to slow the deterioration of the blood glucose levels. Treatment with Glucophage(R) SR must be based on a risk score incorporating appropriate measures of glycemic control and including evidence of high cardiovascular risk. A benefit in the reduction of risk or delay of the onset of type 2 diabetes has not yet been established in patients 75 years and older. About Glucophage(R)  Glucophage(R) (metformin hydrochloride) is a prescription-only medicine indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, particularly in overweight patients when diet and exercise alone have failed. In adults, Glucophage(R) may be given alone or with oral antidiabetic agents, or with insulin. The most commonly reported side effects with Glucophage(R) SR are gastro-intestinal disturbances that may occur during treatment initiation and resolve spontaneously in most cases. The Glucophage(R) product portfolio comprises: Glucophage(R) IR (immediate release formulation) and Glucophage(R) SR (sustained release formulation). Outside of the UK, Glucophage(R) SR is known as Glucophage(R) XR (extended release). In addition, Merck produces Glucovance(R) a fixed dose combination of metformin and glibenclamide.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Merck Develops Alternative CRISPR Genome Editing Method – New technology to improve genome editing, advance new possibilities for research – Creates method to rapidly deploy newly discovered bacterial CRISPR systems in disease-specific applications Merck has developed an alternative CRISPR genome editing method that advances new possibilities for research, creating a way to rapidly deploy newly discovered bacterial CRISPR systems in disease-specific applications Merck has developed a new genome editing tool that makes CRISPR more efficient, flexible and specific, giving researchers more experimental options and faster results that can accelerate drug development and access to new therapies – Research published in prestigious journal, Nature Communications DARMSTADT, Germany, May 17, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Merck, a leading science and technology company, has developed a new genome editing tool that makes CRISPR more efficient, flexible and specific, giving researchers more experimental options and faster results that can accelerate drug development and access to new therapies. This new technique, called „proxy-CRISPR,” provides access to previously unreachable areas of the genome. Most natural CRISPR systems, found in bacteria, cannot work in human cells without significant re-engineering. However, proxy-CRISPR provides a rapid and simple method to increase their usability without the laborious need to re-engineer native CRISPR proteins. The company has filed several patent applications on the proxy-CRISPR technology. These patent applications directed to the proxy-CRISPR technology are just some of several CRISPR patent application filings made by the company since 2012. „With more flexible and easy-to-use genome editing technologies, there is greater potential in research, bioprocessing and novel treatment modalities,” said Udit Batra, Member of the Merck Executive Board and CEO, Life Science. „As a leader in genome editing, Merck’s new technology is just one example of our commitment to solving challenges in the genome editing field, and we will continue to make CRISPR research a priority.” Merck’s research on proxy-CRISPR, „Targeted Activation of Diverse CRISPR-Cas Systems for Mammalian Genome Editing via Proximal CRISPR Targeting,” was published in the April 7, 2017 edition of Nature Communications. The article explains how to make CRISPR more efficient, flexible and specific by opening up the genome for the cutting of DNA, giving researchers more editing options. CRISPR genome editing technology is advancing treatment options for some of the toughest medical conditions faced today, including chronic illnesses and cancers for which there are limited or no treatment options. The applications of CRISPR are far ranging—from identifying genes associated with cancer to reversing mutations that cause blindness. CRISPR enables genome editing using an enzyme called Cas9 to cut DNA, but this has limited targeting abilities. This limitation led to Merck’s focus on proxy-CRISPR. Merck has a 14-year history in the genome editing field, and was the first company to globally offer custom biomolecules for genome editing (TargeTron™ biomolecules and zinc finger nucleases), driving adoption of these techniques within the global research community. Merck was also the first to manufacture arrayed CRISPR libraries covering the entire human genome, accelerating cures for diseases by allowing researchers to explore more questions about the root causes. Merck supports development gene- and cell-based therapeutics and manufactures viral vectors, as well. In 2016, the company launched a genome editing initiative aimed at advancing research in this area through a dedicated team and enhanced resources, further solidifying the company’s commitment to this field. The new technology is a follow-on to Merck’s existing CRISPR applications. The company’s next suite of genome editing tools for the research community, to be launched later in 2017, will include novel and modified versions of Cas and Cas-like proteins. Merck’s CRISPR Epigenetic Activator (p300-Cas9), which advances the way scientists explore epigenetic modification and associated diseases, was recognized as one of the Top 10 Innovations by The Scientist in 2015.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Merck Develops Alternative CRISPR Genome Editing Method New technology to improve genome editing, advance new possibilities for research Creates method to rapidly deploy newly discovered bacterial CRISPR systems in disease-specific applications Research published in prestigious journal, Nature Communications DARMSTADT, Germany, May 17, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Merck, a leading science and technology company, has developed a new genome editing tool that makes CRISPR more efficient, flexible and specific, giving researchers more experimental options and faster results that can accelerate drug development and access to new therapies. This new technique, called "proxy-CRISPR," provides access to previously unreachable areas of the genome. Most natural CRISPR systems, found in bacteria, cannot work in human cells without significant re-engineering. However, proxy-CRISPR provides a rapid and simple method to increase their usability without the laborious need to re-engineer native CRISPR proteins. The company has filed several patent applications on the proxy-CRISPR technology. These patent applications directed to the proxy-CRISPR technology are just some of several CRISPR patent application filings made by the company since 2012. "With more flexible and easy-to-use genome editing technologies, there is greater potential in research, bioprocessing and novel treatment modalities," said Udit Batra, Member of the Merck Executive Board and CEO, Life Science. "As a leader in genome editing, Merck's new technology is just one example of our commitment to solving challenges in the genome editing field, and we will continue to make CRISPR research a priority." Merck's research on proxy-CRISPR, "Targeted Activation of Diverse CRISPR-Cas Systems for Mammalian Genome Editing via Proximal CRISPR Targeting," was published in the April 7, 2017 edition of Nature Communications. The article explains how to make CRISPR more efficient, flexible and specific by opening up the genome for the cutting of DNA, giving researchers more editing options. CRISPR genome editing technology is advancing treatment options for some of the toughest medical conditions faced today, including chronic illnesses and cancers for which there are limited or no treatment options. The applications of CRISPR are far ranging—from identifying genes associated with cancer to reversing mutations that cause blindness. CRISPR enables genome editing using an enzyme called Cas9 to cut DNA, but this has limited targeting abilities. This limitation led to Merck's focus on proxy-CRISPR. Merck has a 14-year history in the genome editing field, and was the first company to globally offer custom biomolecules for genome editing (TargeTron™ biomolecules and zinc finger nucleases), driving adoption of these techniques within the global research community. Merck was also the first to manufacture arrayed CRISPR libraries covering the entire human genome, accelerating cures for diseases by allowing researchers to explore more questions about the root causes. Merck supports development gene- and cell-based therapeutics and manufactures viral vectors, as well. In 2016, the company launched a genome editing initiative aimed at advancing research in this area through a dedicated team and enhanced resources, further solidifying the company's commitment to this field. The new technology is a follow-on to Merck's existing CRISPR applications. The company's next suite of genome editing tools for the research community, to be launched later in 2017, will include novel and modified versions of Cas and Cas-like proteins. Merck's CRISPR Epigenetic Activator (p300-Cas9), which advances the way scientists explore epigenetic modification and associated diseases, was recognized as one of the Top 10 Innovations by The Scientist in 2015.

The scientific committee received over 500 concept submission applications from universities in Africa and Asia and 10 winners were selected for the award. Winners from each university have been granted a one year postgraduate Preventive Cardiovascular Medicine diploma with the University of South Wales, United Kingdom. “Merck Hypertension Award is another step in our long term commitment to support hypertension care strategy through working with local governments, academia and relevant stakeholders in building healthcare capacity with a focus on diabetes, hypertension and other non-communicable diseases in various countries in Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Africa and Latin America,” added Rasha Kelej when making the announcement of the winners during an event in Nairobi, Kenya.  Prof. Eligah Ogola, Vice President of Pan African Cardiology Society said: “We are happy to partner with Merck to implement their Capacity Advancement Program focusing on Hypertension in 2016.

Today marks an important day in the fight against hypertension as we mark the World Hypertension Day. In this context, we have announced ten Merck Hypertension Award 2016 winners.” Merck invited medical students to apply for the “Merck Hypertension Award 2016” with the theme of “What the Healthy Heart needs.” Students across African and Asian medical universities were asked to submit a concept paper on how to improve hypertension awareness, early detection and prevention in their countries and how to encourage their society, scientific community, local authorities, media and relevant stakeholders to ‘think and act’ on hypertension every day. The scientific committee received over 500 concept submission applications from universities in Africa and Asia and 10 winners were selected for the award. Winners from each university have been granted a one year postgraduate Preventive Cardiovascular Medicine diploma with the University of South Wales, United Kingdom. “Merck Hypertension Award is another step in our long term commitment to support hypertension care strategy through working with local governments, academia and relevant stakeholders in building healthcare capacity with a focus on diabetes, hypertension and other non-communicable diseases in various countries in Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Africa and Latin America,” added Rasha Kelej when making the announcement of the winners during an event in Nairobi, Kenya.  Prof. Eligah Ogola, Vice President of Pan African Cardiology Society said: “We are happy to partner with Merck to implement their Capacity Advancement Program focusing on Hypertension in 2016. This combined diabetes and hypertension education program will contribute towards providing guidelines and clinical practice for prevention, diagnosis and management of these diseases and their complications. The objective of this initiative is to increase the level of knowledge for medical students who will work in the near future with patients to help them prevent, understand and control the diseases across the continent”.

Safety concerns are not the reason for the FDA's decision to impose the clinical hold, the Company noted. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Dubai For Lunch?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Lilly to Present Results from Pivotal Breast Cancer Study of Abemaciclib and New Portfolio Data at ASCO 2017 INDIANAPOLIS, May 17, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced that new research demonstrating advances in the Company’s oncology pipeline and product portfolio will be presented at the 53rd Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in Chicago, June 2-6, 2017. Data underscore a strategic focus on targeting the biology of cancer to find new ways to fight cancer and transform care for patients. Highlights include oral presentation of Phase 3 data for abemaciclib, an investigational cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4 & 6 inhibitor for breast cancer, as well as new data from the Company’s ongoing immuno-oncology clinical collaborations with Merck (known as MSD outside the U.S. and Canada) in two trials that are evaluating pemetrexed-plus-carboplatin and ramucirumab, respectively, in combination with Merck’s pembrolizumab. „We are pleased to share how we are building foundational therapeutics with the goal of delivering medicines that help people with cancer live longer and healthier lives,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., senior vice president, global development and medical affairs, Lilly Oncology. „We are particularly excited about the latest results from the abemaciclib MONARCH clinical development program, in which we have endeavored to raise the bar with a potential next-generation CDK4 & 6 inhibitor that we believe may improve outcomes for patients living with breast cancer.” „With abemaciclib we hoped to develop an oral CDK4 & 6 inhibitor that could be taken without interruption. In preclinical research, continued disruption was shown to stop tumor cells from entering the cell cycle, which prevents tumor cell growth and, ultimately, promotes tumor cell death that may translate into clinical benefit for breast cancer patients,” said Alfonso de Dios, senior research fellow, discovery chemistry research & technologies, Lilly. Abemaciclib Data at ASCO Detailed data from the Phase 3 MONARCH 2 study, which evaluated abemaciclib in combination with fulvestrant in women with hormone-receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer, will be presented in an oral presentation. The intent-to-treat population of 669 patients in MONARCH 2 had experienced disease progression on or within 12 months of receiving endocrine treatment in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting or while receiving first-line endocrine therapy for metastatic disease. Additionally, abemaciclib has been shown in preclinical and Phase 1 studies to cross the blood-brain barrier, making this an area of interest for further study. This year’s meeting will allow Lilly to share preliminary Phase 2 data evaluating a CDK4 & 6 inhibitor in patients with new or progressive brain metastases secondary to advanced breast cancer, lung cancer or melanoma. Select studies, along with the times and locations of their data sessions, are highlighted below.

Fourteen of 40, or 35 percent, of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who received Keytruda and Incyte's epacadostat experienced tumor shrinkage of at least 30 percent. That is nearly double the overall response rate of about 18-20 percent seen with Keytruda alone in other studies. BMO Capital Markets analyst Ian Somaiya, in a research note prior to release of the data, said a response rate of about 24-29 percent with a good safety profile would be viewed favorably. Patients in the trial had received prior treatments, such as chemotherapy. Advertisement Advertisement Twelve of the 14 patients who saw significant tumor shrinkage continued to respond to the therapy, with the longest so far at more than 500 days, indicating potential for long-lasting responses. Epacadostat belongs to a new class of experimental drugs called IDO1 inhibitors which block an enzyme that protects tumors from the immune system. Keytruda is one of five approved drugs known as PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors that block a different mechanism tumors use to evade detection. The companies believe the two can work together without the added toxicity observed with other combinations because PD-1 drugs are systemic, while IDO1 works specifically at the tumor site. Three percent of patients discontinued treatment due to side effects, such as elevated liver enzymes, with one patient dropping out with brain swelling. The data was included in a brief summary of the study that will be presented and likely updated next month at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago. There will also be data on the combination in bladder, kidney and head and neck cancers in addition to NSCLC. The companies are planning much larger Phase 3 studies in all of those cancers. "We have an ambitious program and we believe (IDO1 inhibition) can be a very important piece for the next few years in improving immunotherapy for cancer patients," Incyte Chief Executive Herve Hoppenot said. Lung cancer is by far the biggest oncology market with all companies in the immunotherapy field jockeying for position in that space.

[ 1 ] , [ 4 ] - [ 7 ] Merck has already received authorization for this indication in several countries around the world. Through earlier intervention, patients can reduce their risk of developing type 2 diabetes [ 8 ] as well as complications that can lead to serious health issues. [ 5 ] "We are pleased that patients at risk of diabetes in the UK now have a medicinal treatment option to help them delay the onset of diabetes, when intensive lifestyle changes alone are not enough to work against the progression to type 2 diabetes," said Luciano Rossetti MD, Executive Vice President, Global Head of Research & Development at the biopharma business of Merck: "According to WHO, diabetes is considered a global pandemic and we are committed to helping slow the rapidly growing incidence. This is an important achievement as it can help play a role in reducing the burden of type 2 diabetes for patients." The authorization is based on clinical data on the efficacy of Glucophage ® for the treatment of non-diabetic hyperglycemia, primarily gathered in the large US Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) [ 8 ] and subsequent Diabetes Prevention Program Outcome Study (DPPOS) [ 9 ] - [ 1 1 ] with Glucophage ®. This data was complemented by comprehensive safety and efficacy data on Glucophage ® collected since its first use in patients in 1957. Non-diabetic hyperglycemia is triggered by insulin resistance, that causes cells to be unable to effectively utilize insulin, which is needed to get the glucose inside the cells and to stabilize blood glucose levels. This is also called impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). As a response, more insulin may be produced, which may again lose efficacy over time. Eventually, blood glucose levels in the body rise to higher than normal values even between meals, which is called impaired fasting glucose (IFG). Elevated blood glucose levels are also often measured as an average over time through HbA1c. The corresponding lab values for diagnosis of non-diabetic hyperglycemia as per UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, are fasting glucose between 100 and 125 mg/dl, and/or 140 to 199mg/dl in a glucose tolerance test, and/or HbA1c between 6.0 and 6.4%. [ 1 ] From this stage of non-diabetic hyperglycemia, the disease may then further slowly progress to overt type 2 diabetes. Intensive lifestyle changes will be used as a first counter action. If the patient is still at high risk of progression to type 2 diabetes after 3 to 6 months with worsening glycemic control despite intensive lifestyle measures, Glucophage ® SR is now an additional treatment option that may help to slow the deterioration of the blood glucose levels. Treatment with Glucophage ® SR must be based on a risk score incorporating appropriate measures of glycemic control and including evidence of high cardiovascular risk. A benefit in the reduction of risk or delay of the onset of type 2 diabetes has not yet been established in patients 75 years and older. About Glucophage ®   Glucophage ® (metformin hydrochloride) is a prescription-only medicine indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, particularly in overweight patients when diet and exercise alone have failed. In adults, Glucophage ® may be given alone or with oral antidiabetic agents, or with insulin. The most commonly reported side effects with Glucophage ® SR are gastro-intestinal disturbances that may occur during treatment initiation and resolve spontaneously in most cases. The Glucophage ® product portfolio comprises: Glucophage ® IR (immediate release formulation) and Glucophage ® SR (sustained release formulation). Outside of the UK, Glucophage ® SR is known as Glucophage ® XR (extended release). In addition, Merck produces Glucovance ® a fixed dose combination of metformin and glibenclamide.

The "abstract drop" reveals the progress being made in attacking cancer. The data often move stocks, both large and small. Meg Tirrell | @megtirrell 20 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Dan Kitwood | Getty Images | Cancer Research UK Vials containing biological samples are stored on ice to keep them fresh before being analysed to see how they are affected by chemotherapy drugs at the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute on December 9, 2014 in Cambridge, England. On the Wednesday evening halfway through the month of May each year, investors, analysts and biotech reporters all sit glued to their computer screens. At 5 p.m. ET on the dot, the American Society of Clinical Oncology will release thousands of data sets ahead of its annual conference on June 2-6 in Chicago. This year it's about 5,020. The "abstract drop" reveals the progress being made in attacking cancer and, inevitably, moves stocks both large and small. Here's what to keep an eye on Wednesday evening and into Thursday: Immunotherapy The usual suspects in new drugs that harness the immune system to better target cancer are Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, AstraZeneca and Roche. They've developed medicines known as PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors, which essentially reveal cancer cells to our bodies' natural defense systems. They'll each have their own updates, but analysts are also keeping a close eye this year on Incyte, which is developing a medicine that takes a different immunotherapy approach, called an IDO1 inhibitor. The concept is similar: stopping cancer's ability to evade the immune system. And Incyte is testing its drug, called epacadostat, in combination with both Bristol's Opdivo and Merck's Keytruda to see how and where it works best. According to Leerink Research, epacadostat reflects $32 a share, or about 28 percent, of Incyte's valuation. Analyst Michael Schmidt says the stock could swing up or down 10 to 15 percent based on whether the data meet the Street's expectations. NewLink Genetics, Bristol-Myers and Roche's Genentech also have IDO inhibitors in the pipeline. CAR-T A subset of immunotherapy, CAR-T stands for chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, and it's the focus of a handful of companies' development programs. It involves actually removing a patient's blood cells, genetically modifying them to better identify and attack cancer, multiplying them and then re-infusing them. Novartis, Kite Pharma, Juno Therapeutics and Bluebird Bio are among companies working in the technology, which has produced dramatic results for patients for whom other therapies have stopped working, but has also turned up serious safety issues, including a number of deaths in clinical trials. Analysts are specifically watching Bluebird and Juno in the CAR-T space; Bluebird for updates in its program targeting multiple myeloma, and Juno for its program in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, according to research from JPMorgan. Both companies are partnered with Celgene. All the Rest Analysts are also closely watching Eli Lilly for an update on its experimental breast cancer drug, abemaciclib; biotech company Epizyme, for an update on its experimental medicine tazemetostat targeting certain genetically defined solid tumors; and another immunotherapy agent from drugmaker Nektar, NKTR-214. Some of the most anticipated data may be revealed in more detail at the actual conference in a few weeks rather than Wednesday evening. The question for the market this week, according to Leerink's Geoff Porges, "is whether investors will follow the usual rule and buy the abstracts and sell the meeting."

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman CISCRP Launches Clinical Trial Volunteer Awareness and Recognition Campaign in USA Today The Clinical Trials supplement features educational articles and inspiring stories about clinical research for patients and the public. It is only in collaboration with patients that we can advance medical innovation and truly improve the health of people around the world. Boston, MA (PRWEB) May 17, 2017 The nonprofit Center for Information and Study on Clinical Research Participation (CISCRP) announces that it is launching a new campaign, The National Clinical Trial Outreach and Awareness Initiative, to reach millions of Americans. Several times each year – beginning with USA Today on May 12th – CISCRP will be producing and distributing educational supplements in major national newspapers designed to inform the public and patients about the clinical research process. Each supplement will include educational feature articles and messages about the important role that clinical research volunteers play in advancing public health. In this first edition on Clinical Trials, CISCRP has teamed up with several leading organizations including TransCelerate Biopharma Inc., Biogen, Merck, Pfizer Inc., Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc., Segal Institute for Clinical Research, and Praxis to develop the educational and laudatory materials. The USA Today supplement hit newsstands in a number of major cities including Boston, New York, Phoenix, Washington D.C., Baltimore, and Los Angeles. Although an estimated 75,000 clinical trials are conducted each year for severe and debilitating disease conditions, the majority of the public and patients report knowing very little about clinical research and where to go to learn more. CISCRP is launching The National Clinical Trial Outreach and Awareness Initiative to raise the visibility of clinical research, to provide general education, and to elevate the level of public and patient preparedness to navigate the clinical research process. The current supplement is expected to reach more than 20 million people through print and digital channels. “Clinical trials are the life blood of scientific invention, and the generosity of study volunteers is essential as we work together toward medical breakthroughs that can have a lasting impact on people’s health, well-being, and welfare,” said Andy Lee, Senior Vice President of Global Clinical Trial Operations at Merck Research Laboratories. “Merck salutes the patient volunteers who are helping to push the boundaries of science, and helping ensure better health for society today and for generations to come.” Recognizing those study volunteers who do participate in clinical trials is essential to spreading awareness about the important role that they play in the clinical research process and in improving public health. Murray Abramson, Vice President of Global Clinical Operations at Biogen, comments “Without patients’ contributions and voice, solving the greatest challenges in medicine and conquering disease would not be possible. Patients, thank you!!!” Content in this USA Today Supplement on Clinical Trials includes an advertisement thanking and honoring individuals who have given the gift of their participation in clinical trials; a feature story about one young women’s experience in clinical trials; and a headline profile about T.J. Sharpe, a melanoma cancer survivor and clinical trial participant. Dalvir Gill, PhD, CEO of TransCelerate BioPharma, Inc., noted, “Enhancing the patient experience as they move through their clinical research journey is of utmost importance. That includes facilitating their ability to find and enroll in trials, and supporting their understanding of how a clinical trial works. It also means that the broader industry needs to continue to drive the advancement of innovative solutions that will ease patient burden, and identify efficiencies to make recruitment and participation in clinical research easier. It is only in collaboration with patients that we can advance medical innovation and truly improve the health of people around the world.” The clinical trials supplement is available on newsstands on May 12th. To view the digital supplement, visit CISCRP’s website. Be sure to check the CISCRP website frequently for more information on upcoming outreach and awareness campaigns and how you can get involved.

The settlement, disclosed in papers filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey on Monday, came in a class action filed in 2001 arising out of a settlement in patent litigation between Upsher-Smith and Schering-Plough Corp, now owned by Merck. That patent deal, plaintiffs in the antitrust class action said, was an example of a "pay-for-delay" settlement, in which brand-name drug makers pay generic companies to keep their products off the market for a longer period. Both companies continued to deny wrongdoing as part of the settlement, according to court papers. The settlement is subject to court approval. Neither Merck nor Upsher-Smith immediately responded to requests for comment on Tuesday. The lawsuit stemmed from a settlement between the companies in 1998 that resolved patent litigation in which Schering-Plough sought to block Upsher-Smith from marketing a planned generic version of K-Dur until a patent expired in 2006. Under that settlement, Upsher-Smith agreed not to market a generic version before 2001, at which point Schering would grant it a license, and Schering agreed to pay Upsher-Smith at least $60 million, according to court papers. The class action lawsuit, by direct purchasers of K-Dur including drug wholesalers and hospitals, said the companies violated antitrust laws through the unlawful delay of generic K-Dur. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission had also sued Schering-Plough in 2011 over payments to rivals to delay generic versions of K-Dur. The FTC ultimately lost that case. The case is In re K-Dur Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey, No. 01-cv-01652.

WHO said it was sending the team to the remote area in the north of the country near the border with Central African Republic. And a large vaccine nonprofit said it was ready to bring in Ebola vaccines if needed. Map showing the location of the Democratic Republic of Congo Google Maps "As of today, 11 suspected cases including three deaths have been reported," WHO said Saturday The #Ebola case in the Democratic Republic of Congo was confirmed by a national reference laboratory in Kinshasa #DRC— WHO (@WHO) May 12, 2017 "The health zone is situated in the remote, isolated and hard-to-reach northern part of the country, with limited transport and communication networks - factors that all impeded transmission of information about the suspected outbreak. Currently it takes about two to three days to reach the epicenter from Kinshasa," WHO said. "The full extent of the 2017 outbreak is still not yet clear." Related: Ebola Vaccine Works, Study Shows An Ebola epidemic in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia in 2013-2016 infected 28,000 people and killed more than 11,000 of them. It was the only epidemic of Ebola — usually, outbreaks are smaller and affect at the most a few hundred people. Vaccine developers rushed research on Ebola vaccines and there is an experimental vaccine that's been shown to be effective. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, has an agreement with vaccine maker Merck to have it ready. "Gavi's work with Merck means there are 300,000 doses of Ebola vaccine available if needed to stop this outbreak becoming a pandemic," Gavi CEO Dr. Seth Berkley said. "The vaccine has shown high efficacy in clinical trials and could play a vital role in protecting the most vulnerable." Related: Antibody Treatment Works Against Ebola Virus Cousin The Democratic Republic of Congo has had eight outbreaks but none in areas similar to the West Africa epidemic, which spread widely in part because of intense cross-border travel and trade in densely populated areas. The last one was in 2014, and killed 49 people. "It is a sad fact that the people of the DRC are all too familiar with this horrific disease," Berkley added in a statement. "The fact that this is a country that has experience dealing with Ebola should give us hope that we won't see a pandemic on the scale of the 2014 outbreak that hit West Africa. We stand ready to support the DRC Government in its fight against Ebola."

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 18 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Antihypertensive Drugs Market Research Report by Regional Analysis: Key Trends and Forecast Research Report 2023 Human health is being affected by various factors which include rapid urbanization, demographic ageing and the globalization of unhealthy lifestyles. Hypertension is one of the keyhealth issuesthat are observed in both developed as well as developing countries. It is a silent, invisible killer that rarely causes symptoms and is one of the key risk factors forcoronary heart disease and ischemic as well as hemorrhagic stroke. Hypertension can also lead to various other problemssuch as renal impairment, visual impairment, heart failure and retinal hemorrhage. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 7.5 million deaths globally are caused due to hypertension, and it accounts to 12.8% of the total deaths. Globally,in 2008 prevalence of hypertension was observed to be around 40% in adults aged 25. According to the National Health and Nutrition Evaluation Survey, ithas been noted that in United States from 2007 to 2010,81.5% of the population is aware of their hypertension condition, out of which 74% are being treated and only 52.5% are under control. Theantihypertensive drugs market based on the therapy area is classified into diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide and indapamide), calcium channel blockers (nifedipine, felodipine and diltiazem), angiotensin receptor blockers or ARBs (losartan), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)inhibitors (captopril, lisinopril and perindopril), beta blockers vasodilators (atenolol and propranolol), alpha blockers (clonidine, guanabenz), and renin inhibitors.Diuretics being the first line of treatment for hypertension holds the major share of the market. All these drug classes (drugs) have shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The drugs are administered either as a single or combined dose depending upon the stage of hypertension, whilethe choice of drugs depends upon the patients’ medical history and current conditions. View Report- www.transparencymarketresearch.com/antihypertensive-drugs… On the basis of the geography, the antihypertensive market can be segmented into North America, Europe, AsiaPacific, Latin America, and Middle East and Africa.The global antihypertensive market is dominated mainly by North America and Europe. According to the WHO, the prevalence of hypertension is highest in Africa and lowest in Americas. In Africa more than 40% of the adults suffer from hypertension and many of them remain undiagnosed due to the high cost of medications.The increased genericization by the local companies can be a challenge for the market. Similarly, in recent years, there has beena significant improvement in the management of hypertension contributing to a strong decline in the death rates in North America and Western Europe The change in lifestyle, elevated stress level, and rise in prevalent population, early detection and penetration of combined dose would be the main factors to drive the growth of antihypertensive market. The patent expiry for major drugs such as Diovan (Novartis), Cozaar (Merck),Revatio (Pfizer), Exforge (Novartis), Atacand (AstraZeneca), Avapro (Sanofi Aventis), BIopress(Takeda) and Benicar (Daiichi Sankyo), along with low diagnostics rate and increased generic penetration would result in the antihypertensive market slowdown, but the novel antihypertensive drugs in the pipeline can recover the losses of patent expiration. Some of the major key players in the global antihypertensive market includes Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., Sanofi S.A, Johnson & Johnson Ltd., Daiichi – Sankyo, Merck & Co., AstraZeneca Plc.,Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited and Lupin Limited.

About Avelumab  Avelumab is a human antibody specific for a protein called PD-L1, or programmed death ligand-1. Avelumab is designed to potentially engage both the adaptive and innate immune systems. By binding to PD-L1, avelumab is thought to prevent tumor cells from using PD-L1 for protection against white blood cells, such as T-cells, exposing them to anti-tumor responses. Avelumab has been shown to induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro. In November 2014, Merck and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab. ***Indications The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for avelumab (BAVENCIO(R)) for the treatment of (i) metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older and (ii) patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or who have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. Avelumab is not approved for any indication in any market outside the U.S. Important Safety Information   The warnings and precautions for BAVENCIO include immune-mediated adverse reactions (such as pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis and renal dysfunction and other adverse reactions), infusion-related reactions and embryo-fetal toxicity. Common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) in patients treated with avelumab include fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, nausea, infusion-related reaction, peripheral edema, decreased appetite/hypophagia, urinary tract infection and rash. About Erbitux(R) (cetuximab)   Erbitux(R) is a highly active IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). As a monoclonal antibody, the mode of action of Erbitux is distinct from standard non-selective chemotherapy treatments in that it specifically targets and binds to the EGFR. This binding inhibits the activation of the receptor and the subsequent signal-transduction pathway, which results in reducing both the invasion of normal tissues by tumor cells and the spread of tumors to new sites. It is also believed to inhibit the ability of tumor cells to repair the damage caused by chemotherapy and radiotherapy and to inhibit the formation of new blood vessels inside tumors, which appears to lead to an overall suppression of tumor growth. Erbitux also targets cytotoxic immune effector cells towards EGFR expressing tumor cells (antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, ADCC). The most commonly reported side effect with Erbitux is an acne-like skin rash. In approximately 5% of patients, hypersensitivity reactions may occur during treatment with Erbitux; about half of these reactions are severe. Erbitux has already obtained market authorization in over 90 countries world-wide for the treatment of RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer and for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Merck licensed the right to market Erbitux, a registered trademark of ImClone LLC, outside the U.S. and Canada from ImClone LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company, in 1998. About M3814  M3814 is an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). DNA-PK is a key enzyme for non-homologous end-joining (NEHJ), the most important DNA double strand break repair pathway (DSB), and could potentially enhance the efficacy of many commonly used DNA-damaging agents such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy. M3814 complements Merck's extensive DNA damage response (DDR) portfolio and is currently in Phase I studies.

Be aware that all patients received golimumab in an open "run-in" phase. Effects of this active treatment may have extended into the withdrawal phase, biasing the results towards the null hypothesis. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor golimumab (Simponi) failed to meet the primary endpoint in a study of children with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Among patients receiving subcutaneous golimumab, 30 mg/m2 every 4 weeks, 41% flared by week 48 of treatment, as did 47.4% of those given placebo, a difference that was not statistically significant (P=0.41), reported Hermine I. Brunner, MD, director of the Division of Rheumatology at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, and colleagues. In addition, the median time to flare was similar, at 108.4 weeks with golimumab and 95.6 weeks with placebo, according to the study online in Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases. Golimumab has demonstrated efficacy among adults with rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and ulcerative colitis. To see if this monoclonal antibody could also be effective in polyarticular JIA, Brunner and colleagues enrolled patients from 33 centers in 12 countries. Patients had at least five joints with active arthritis despite 3 months or more of methotrexate treatment. Stable doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and low-dose corticosteroids were permitted, and methotrexate was continued throughout the study. The first part of the study was a 16-week open-label phase in which all patients received golimumab. At week 16, when the second part of the study began, all patients who had achieved at least a 30% improvement in the JIA American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR30) were randomized to continue golimumab or receive placebo, up to week 48 or until they flared. Part three of the study was intended to be open-label treatment with golimumab in the same doses as in part one through week 248, but the study was discontinued by the sponsors, Janssen Research & Development and Merck/Schering-Plough, when the primary endpoint was not met. A total of 173 patients enrolled in the study, 154 entered part two, and 145 remained in the study to start part three. The mean age at enrollment was 11, three-quarters were girls, and the mean number of joints with active arthritis was 15. The mean dose of methotrexate was 16 mg/week, 25% of patients were taking oral prednisone in doses of 5 mg/day, and 21 patients had previously used another TNF inhibitor. During part one of the trial, improvements began to be seen by week 4. Responses of ACR30, 50%, 70%, and 90%, were achieved by 89%, 79.2%, 65.9%, and 36.4%, respectively, at week 16, while 34.1% of patients achieved a state of clinically inactive disease. But during part two, which was double-blind and placebo-controlled, significant differences were not seen in the flare rates or rates of clinical remission, which were 12.8% in the golimumab group and 11.8% in the placebo group (P=0.848). Among the 76 patients who were assigned to the placebo group for part two of the trial, 33 flared and were switched to the active treatment before week 48, 33 were still on placebo at week 48 but then were switched, and 10 were in clinical remission and then discontinued from the study. For those who reached week 96 before the study was terminated, ACR JIA30, 50, 70, and 90 responses were seen in 69.1%, 69.1%, 64.7%, and 48.5% of those who had been in the active treatment group during part two, and in 73.8%, 73.8%, 68.9%, and 52.5% of those who had been in the placebo group and subsequently switched. Trough levels of serum golimumab were comparable to what has been seen among adults with rheumatoid arthritis. Antibodies to golimumab developed in 46.8% of patients, with eight having high titers. During 325.6 patient-years of exposure to golimumab, the most common adverse events were upper respiratory infections, nasopharyngitis, flare of JIA, and vomiting. The rates of adverse events and serious adverse events per 100 patient-years were similar in the golimumab and placebo groups during part two of the study, and 116 adverse events in 88 patients were rated as possibly, probably, or definitely related to the treatment. One patient was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, which improved after discontinuation of golimumab, but was "a concern," the researchers noted. "Results of this study demonstrate that subcutaneous golimumab dosed at 30 mg/m2 body surface area (maximum: 50 mg) every 4 weeks resulted in a rapid response to open-label therapy, had an acceptable safety profile, and yielded a similar pharmacokinetic profile as that achieved in adults with rheumatoid arthritis." Brunner et al noted that the withdrawal design of the study was chosen because of ethical concerns about excessive exposure to placebo among children. However, the design also has drawbacks, in that the clinical effects of biologic agents given in part one, the open-label phase, can extend beyond their pharmacologic half-life into the placebo phase, influencing flare rates. The team also suggested that the mandatory use of methotrexate in the study may have contributed to the failure to achieve the primary endpoint. The study was funded by Janssen Research & Development, a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, and Merck/Schering-Plough. The authors reported financial relationships with Janssen, AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Takeda, Novartis, UCB, AbbVie, Amgen, Biogen Idec, Boehringer Ingelheim, Celgene, MedImmune, Novo Nordisk, Sanofi Aventis, Servier, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Genzyme, and several co-authors are employees of Janssen Research & Development.

(NASDAQ: SNDX) saw a huge gain on Wednesday after the firm gave an update on its non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) midstage trial. Specifically, the company announced that Encore 601 has met the prespecified objective response threshold to advance into the second stage of the Phase 2 trial and will reopen enrollment immediately. Encore 601 is a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial evaluating the combination of entinostat plus Merck’s anti-PD-1 blocking therapy, Keytruda (pembrolizumab). The trial is enrolling two distinct cohorts of NSCLC patients: those who had previously progressed on PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy and those naïve to PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy. Also for the trial to be able to advance into the definitive stage of the Phase 2 study, at least two out of 20 NSCLC patients who had previously progressed on PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy or three out of 13 NSCLC patients previously “naïve” to PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy need to demonstrate an objective response — either a partial response (PR) or complete response (CR). The cohort of NSCLC patients who had previously progressed on PD-1 or PD-L1 will now reopen and enroll a total of 56 patients. The company expects to complete enrollment in the first half of 2018. Later this quarter, Syndax anticipates being able to determine whether to expand the cohort of NSCLC patients naïve to PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy. Matthew D. Hellmann, M.D., medical oncologist and immunotherapy expert at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, commented: PD-1 therapies have offered important clinical benefit to patients with NSCLC, but unfortunately only a subset of patients respond. There is tremendous need for new combinations to further improve responses to PD-1 therapies. The early data here with several objective responses to the entinostat – pembrolizumab combination in patients with NSCLC who previously progressed on PD-1 therapy is promising and certainly worth additional investigation. Shares of Syndax were trading up 37% at $12.90 on Wednesday, with a consensus analyst price target of $26.13 and a 52-week trading range of $6.31 to $18.03.

People are worried that people aren't worried enough. "Trump Faces Deepest Crisis of Presidency as Comey Memo Surfaces," is the headline here, from Bloomberg Politics. "GOP Reels From Trump Chaos as Congress Struggles to Chart Course," is another one, about how any sort of pro-business legislation is increasingly unlikely given the White House's daily disasters. "White House Turmoil Puts the GOP Agenda at Risk," adds the Wall Street Journal. And Ross Douthat writes that Donald Trump's own closest advisers "have no respect for him, indeed they seem to palpate with contempt for him, and to regard their mission as equivalent to being stewards for a syphilitic emperor." None of this is ... good. "Here's What the Latest Trump-Comey News Is Doing to Markets," is the headline here, from Bloomberg Markets, and from the depth of the crisis I bet you can predict what it is doing to markets: not that much, really! "U.S. stocks could be in for a weak Wednesday if index futures are any guide, with S&P 500 e-mini futures down 0.6 percent as of 12:46 p.m. Tokyo time." (I see them down about 0.8 percent just before 9:30 a.m. in New York.) The S&P 500's realized volatility over the past couple of "complacent" months has been about 7 percent, approximating a standard deviation of daily returns of about 0.4 percent. "The Presidency Is in Crisis," notes Daniel Gross. "Why Are Financial Markets Still So Calm?"  Last week I scoffed at the notion that social media and the rise of fake news have caused the decline in volatility. "The reality is the opposite," I said: "Stocks are constantly moving around on dumb fake news, or on dumb news about entirely unrelated companies." But it is hard to resist the idea that there is a news-fatigue element to what is going on. Stocks, traditionally, have overreacted to news. A thing happened, and traders thought they were smart and over-interpreted it, and the next day something else happened and people over-interpreted it the other way. But there is just too much news now. If you over-interpreted all of it, you'd get whiplash. So a retreat into under-interpreting -- from panicking at minor news to shrugging off huge news -- seems like a natural reaction. The new way to tell yourself that you're smart is by not reacting to news; the meta-over-interpretation of the news environment is to under-interpret any particular piece of news. Elsewhere, my Bloomberg colleague Tracy Alloway discusses a popular technical explanation for the lack of volatility, which is that dealers are long gamma on stock indexes: Large dealer banks that buy or sell the S&P 500 to hedge exposure to U.S. equities are helping to suppress realized volatility and keep the VIX low, the Deutsche Bank analysts say. By their estimates, dealers would have to buy $14 billion if the S&P 500 fell by 1 percent. It’s all about "gamma" -- the third Greek letter. “When dealers are long gamma they sell equities when equities are rising, but buy them when they’re falling,” write Deutsche Bank analysts led by Rocky Fishman. But "technical" explanations often turn out to be fundamental explanations in different words. The reason that volatility is low is that dealers are suppressing it. The reason dealers are suppressing realized volatility is that they are long a lot of options and need to hedge.. The reason they are long a lot of options is that investors have sold them a lot of options. (The reason they need to hedge is that they are not in the business of taking outright positions: They are service providers, bookies, not bettors themselves.) The reason that investors have sold them a lot of options is, roughly speaking, that investors think volatility will be low. Combining all that, you get: The reason that volatility is low is that investors think volatility will be low. That is a perfectly sensible explanation! The reason that anything is anything, in financial markets, is that people think the thing will be the thing. That's what financial markets are; they're mechanisms for transforming investor opinion into asset prices. But it is not a particularly explanatory explanation, or a particularly technical one. Interposing the term "gamma" between "investors think volatility will be low" and "volatility is low" has the feeling of science: Ah, see, there is a reason that volatility is low, a reason that can be explained with science and that is external to the aggregated feelings of market participants. But, nah, the science just explains how the feelings are aggregated; at bottom, the feelings are all there is. Activists. Here is a story about how activist hedge-fund managers have run out of low-hanging fruit like stock buybacks and corporate breakups, and are increasingly seeking to make money by replacing chief executive officers at the companies they target. The CEOs, unsurprisingly, object: Some CEOs who have been targeted complain privately that activists don’t understand their businesses. “They’ve never built anything in their life, except a spreadsheet,” one said recently. Others say boards should determine the CEO. They argue that activists seek too much power given the size of their stakes, which amount to as little as 1% in some cases. To be fair, most of the CEOs named in the article owned less than 1 percent of their companies. So why should the CEOs have more power than the activists? I guess that is a dumb question. The CEOs are (or were) the CEOs. They were chosen via a standard and well-understood process by which the company's owners (the shareholders) delegate their authority to directors and managers. (Basically: In the distant mythical past, a CEO chose some board members, and the shareholders voted for those board members in uncontested elections, and the board members chose some other board members, who were also elected without much fuss, and the board members chose the current CEO.) There are feedback mechanisms connecting the CEO and the shareholders -- the CEO talks to the shareholders, and is compensated based on shareholder return, and she and the board have fiduciary duties to those shareholders, and so forth -- but they are sort of indirect. They embody a paternalistic idea of corporate management by directors and managers, whose duties to shareholders involve essentially doing the right thing for shareholders -- in the managers' own judgment -- not doing what the shareholders want. The activist, on the other hand, has no formal power; if he gets any power over the company, it is by convincing the other shareholders -- or the board or CEO -- that he is right. He also has few or no fiduciary duties to other shareholders: He is explicitly acting for his own profit, not for the good of all shareholders. (It's just that the way for him to profit is to make the share price go up, which other shareholders will also like.) It is an idea of corporate management by direct shareholder participation, in which shareholders are much more closely involved in managerial decisions than they are in the traditional paternalistic model. Shareholders are not protected by managers' duties, or by the historical role of managers; they're protected by direct participation. You can see why the CEOs prefer the first model! And it's not just that they like to keep their jobs. They're right, aren't they, that they have spent their lives CEOing and understanding their businesses, while activists -- and shareholders generally -- have not. Shareholders are good at shareholding, at picking companies; managers, in the model, are good at managing the companies; and boards are good at picking the managers. There is a division of labor, an expertise, a technocratic division between managers and investors. But the activists' pitch has an appeal too: They only win if they're right, or at least, if they can persuade shareholders that they're right.  Yahoo! Yahoo! Inc. has not yet closed the sale of its operating business to Verizon Communications and changed its name to "Altaba," but in the financial markets it is already rebranding itself as just a proxy on Alibaba Group Holding Limited stock. Yesterday Yahoo announced a tender offer to buy back up to $3 billion of its own stock, based on the trading price of Alibaba's stock: Yahoo will pay its shareholders between 0.37 and 0.42 times the price of an Alibaba share for each share of Yahoo that they tender. The purpose of the tender offer is presumably to get rid of some of the cash coming in from Verizon, as well as to give current Yahoo shareholders an elegant exit from the future Altaba husk: The purpose of the tender offer is to provide liquidity to a potentially significant number of stockholders that will be forced to sell their shares at or prior to the closing of the pending sale of Yahoo’s operating business to Verizon Communications Inc. (the “Sale Transaction”) as a result of the fact that, upon completion of the Sale Transaction, the Company will be required to register as a closed-end investment company under the Investment Company of 1940 and its shares are expected to be removed from the Standard and Poor’s 500 Composite Index (the “S&P 500”) and other indices. The tender offer also enables the Company to potentially return a significant amount of cash to its stockholders by repurchasing shares.  But the numbers are also evocative. Yahoo owns about 384 million shares of Alibaba stock, and there are about 958 million Yahoo shares outstanding. That works out to one Yahoo share corresponding to about 0.4 Alibaba shares, plus whatever else Yahoo has (Yahoo Japan, a pile of cash, and, for a little while longer, the operating business). Tendering at a price range centered around 0.4 Alibaba shares per Yahoo share does send a nice hint that that's what the Yahoo shares should be worth. Should index funds be illegal? The idea that institutional investors undermine competition when they own shares in lots of companies in the same industry has spread across the Atlantic: The rise of passive investing, led by asset-management powerhouses like BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest issuer of index-based ETFs, evokes memories of “Deutschland AG,” according to Achim Wambach, the head of the ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim and chairman of the Monopolies Commission, which advises the government on competition and regulation. He’s referring to the web of cross-shareholdings in German industry by banks and insurers that emerged in the late 20th century. If an investment firm like BlackRock holds in its $1.3 trillion of global ETF assets stakes in Bayer AG and Merck KGaA, Germany’s largest publicly traded pharmaceutical companies, “then BlackRock has less interest in Bayer and Merck competing with each other, but rather that both companies are doing well,” he said. “It’s reminiscent of the old Deutschland AG.” We have talked about this theory before, though I suppose the "Deutschland AG" version is somewhere on the continuum between "index funds are like the old monopoly trusts of the Gilded Age" and "index funds are like Marxism." Index funds are like ... someone owning a lot of companies, is the basic gist. That seems inarguable -- they really do own shares in a lot of companies! -- but BlackRock quibbles even with that: “Deutschland AG was concentrated ownership whereby financial institutions had outsized investments in industrial companies,” said BlackRock Vice Chairman Barbara Novick. “This is a very different situation because BlackRock does not own the assets we manage, our clients do.” That is actually a very odd defense? I mean it is trivially true that the ultimate economic ownership of companies owned by BlackRock lies with BlackRock's clients, just as the ultimate economic ownership of companies owned by German banks and insurers lay with their shareholders and policyholders. But presumably BlackRock manages those investments in those clients' interests, and if those clients want companies not to compete with each other, shouldn't BlackRock want that too? I am sympathetic with the intuition that diversified asset managers aren't "really" conglomerates who own lots of competing companies and who have economic interests in how those companies compete, but it is a little hard to articulate why that is true. Elsewhere in indexing, "the Securities and Exchange Commission will reconsider its initial approval of a risky, first-of-its-kind exchange-traded fund that promises four times the daily price moves of S&P 500 futures contracts." Fiduciaries. My Bloomberg View colleague Noah Smith writes about last week's Wall Street Journal article in which the reporter, Andrea Fuller, tried to figure out how much she was paying in fees on her investments. The answer turned out to be 1.4 percent -- 0.85 percent to her adviser, and 0.55 percent in mutual-fund fees -- but it took her forever to figure it out, and people kept telling her different things. Fuller's point was that the investing industry is weirdly opaque, even to sophisticated consumers. Smith's point is that "to pay 1.4 percent a year is an absolutely enormous amount," potentially a third of Fuller's lifetime savings over time. "I suspect that these quasi-hidden fees are a huge reservoir of financial dark matter," he writes, "a giant slush fund that feeds many of the excesses in other areas of finance."  But my reaction to Fuller's article was: This is a fee-only fiduciary financial adviser, right? There has been a lot of discussion recently about the conflicts of interest when investors get advice from brokers who are paid secret commissions to sell them expensive mutual funds with opaque fees; the Department of Labor, under President Obama, had written new rules to reduce those conflicts and require more brokers to act as fiduciaries for their customers. But that's not the problem here. Fuller's mutual funds cost 0.55 percent, below average for stock funds (though way above what most good index funds charge). Her adviser costs 0.85 percent per year, the flat-fee structure that advocates of the fiduciary rule prefer, because it minimizes the conflicts of interest. But she ends up paying 1.4 percent a year, and as Smith points out, "her financial advisers have little chance of beating the market." All of the correct boxes are checked: Flat-fee adviser, unconflicted fiduciary advice, even relatively low-cost diversified mutual funds. And yet the combination still seems too expensive. I don't know what you do with that. (I mean, I know what I do: "just go to Vanguard Group's website and buy some of its low-cost index funds and exchange-traded funds," as Smith advises.) When the Obama administration was advocating the fiduciary rule, it produced a report suggesting that it could save investors $17 billion a year, by reducing their investing fees from 1.3 percent to 0.2 percent. Fuller's fiduciary adviser costs 1.4 percent. If the fiduciary rule pushes investors from high-cost mutual funds recommended by commission-based advisers to medium-cost mutual funds recommended by expensive fee-based advisers -- and if investors' all-in costs aren't any lower -- then what have we gained? Elsewhere in financial advising: Advisers who work with millennials say dress isn’t the only way they may differ from older generations. Millennials—those born roughly between the early 1980s and the early 2000s—want their adviser to act more like a life coach and aren’t usually interested in hearing advisers’ predictions on how much they need to save now so they can retire later. They also want advisers to be tech-savvy and to host exclusive events, such as parties with famous artists, so they can be treated like VIPs. Twitter. The basic reason to start a startup is that it is fun to hang out with your friends and build computer things, and also you might get crazy rich. If you do get crazy rich, and take the startup public, then you have to exchange your hoodies for dress hoodies, and piously pretend that you are interested in creating long-term shareholder value instead of having fun hanging out with your friends. It is a weird pivot, and I get the sense sometimes that Twitter, Inc. has given up on it. Here is a Medium post from Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, who is returning to Twitter to do a job that sounds suspiciously like "hang out with his buddies": My top focus will be to guide the company culture, that energy, that feeling. This is where Jack, and Twitter’s inestimable CMO, Leslie Berland, feel I can have the most powerful impact. It’s important that everyone understands the whole story of Twitter and each of our roles in that story. I’ll shape the experience internally so it’s also felt outside the company. More soon. I’m not replacing anyone at Twitter. Somebody mentioned I’m just filling the “Biz shaped hole” I left. You might even say the job description includes being Biz Stone. Yes, exactly, my role in my friend group is to be myself. My role in my job is to do my job. The distinction seems obvious to me, but it is blurred in Silicon Valley. People are worried about unicorns. "The Startup That Wants to Sell You a Subscription to New York City Tap Water Explains Itself," is the headline here, and the explanation is ... marginally less bad than you'd expect? Reefill, the startup, does not seem to be a unicorn, but I am obviously rooting for a tap-water unicorn. If you like Juicero, the startup that will sell you a $400 machine to squeeze juice out of a bag instead of using your hands, you'll love a startup that will sell you tap water. I hope they put the water on the blockchain. You wouldn't want anyone to hack the product by just turning on a faucet themselves! Things happen.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Dividend Stocks Perfect for Senior Citizens These three dividend stocks are reliable sources of income for senior citizens. George Budwell, Rich Smith, and Tim Brugger (TMFGBudwell) May 17, 2017 at 9:42AM Dividend stocks are a great source of passive income. But like any equity, they can come with a heavy dose of risk that's frankly unsuitable for older investors.  Keeping this theme in mind, we asked three of our contributors which dividend stocks they think might be reliable sources of income for senior citizens. They suggested Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT). Read on to find out more about these top dividend stocks, and why they might be a perfect fit for older investors.  Image Source: Getty Images. This Big Pharma is a reliable source of passive income George Budwell (Pfizer): I think Pfizer is a perfect stock for senior citizens because it offers a better than average yield within its peer group, it has a rock-solid balance sheet, and, most importantly, it has several key growth drivers coming online right now. More specifically, Pfizer's 3.88% yield is not only slightly better than the 3.44% average among major drug manufacturers, but the drugmaker also has close to $18 billion in cash reserves and has consistently generated cash flows in excess of $14.6 billion over the past the three years running. Suffice it to say, this top drugmaker's juicy dividend is in no real danger of a sizable reduction or a suspension anytime soon. And that's the kind of safety net you want as an older investor. On the growth front, Pfizer is going through a somewhat worrisome period because of the upcoming loss of exclusivity for both Viagra and Lyrica in the United States. However, the company does have a full stable of late-stage clinical products that should more than offset these losses. As a prime example, Pfizer and its partner Merck have now successfully submitted their novel Type 2 diabetes drug candidate, ertugliflozin, to the FDA for approval. If the FDA green-lights ertugliflozin before year's end, as most industry experts expect, Pfizer should have yet another megablockbuster product on its hands.  Bottom line: Senior citizens, in my opinion, would be wise to buy this stable, large-cap pharma stock as a dependable source of passive income.  Income and conservative growth: a match made in heaven Tim Brugger (Cisco Systems): At first glance, Cisco's second-quarter earnings may not have appeared overly impressive. The $11.6 billion in revenue was a 2% decline compared with a year ago, and its $0.57 per share in earnings was flat. That said, last quarter demonstrates perfectly why Cisco belongs in most senior citizens' portfolios. The reasons behind Cisco's slight decrease in sales were twofold. One, CEO Chuck Robbins is transforming Cisco into a software, data-center, security, and Internet of Things powerhouse, all markets with nearly unlimited upside as the world goes digital. The most critical reason for Cisco's slight hiccup is what makes it ideal for investors in search of some growth in addition to income. Cisco is focused on building its subscription-based recurring-revenue foundation, and it's working. Cisco CFO Kelly Kramer summed up last quarter by saying he was "pleased with our progress on business transformation to software and recurring revenues." Service revenue climbed 5% last quarter to $3.1 billion, thanks in large part to Cisco's software and data security sales. The better news is that Cisco's subscription and recurring software deferred revenue soared 51% year over year to $4 billion. Deferred revenue gives investors a sense of what to expect going forward. Also, recurring revenue builds a sustainable foundation shareholders can rely on, and that translates to stability over the long haul. Cisco also boosted its already impressive dividend 12% last quarter and now boasts a 3.37% yield. Combined with its conservative approach to growth, Cisco is perfect for senior citizens. Invest in a classic Rich Smith (Mattel): I can't think of a more perfect stock for senior citizens to own than Mattel -- a company that, by the way, is "senior citizen" age itself. Born in 1945, Mattel hit 72 years young this year. And chances are, if you're a senior citizen yourself, you've grown up with Mattel. You probably know the company, and its iconic Barbie and Fisher-Price products, better than many kids playing with Mattel's more faddish Monster High and Minecraft toys today. And speaking of kids, if you're in the habit of buying toys for your grandkids, then chances are you've got a good idea of which toys the tykes are asking for on their birthdays, for Christmas, and so on. Fact is, you probably know how well Mattel is doing relative to, for example, arch rival Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS), better than a lot of analysts on Wall Street do. As for how well Mattel compares as an investment -- well, we can fill you in on that part. At $7.55 billion in market capitalization, Mattel is about 60% the size of Hasbro as a company. Yet with $5.3 billion in annual sales, Mattel actually sells more toys than its rival. What really sets Mattel apart from Hasbro as an investment, though, is its dividend. Currently, Mattel stock is paying out 6.9% in annual dividends to its shareholders. That's three times as much as Hasbro's relatively stingy 2.3% dividend yield. To my mind, that makes Mattel a much more attractive investment for seniors, seeking a steady stream of dividend income to live on in retirement.  George Budwell owns shares of Pfizer.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman MilliporeSigma Develops Alternative CRISPR Genome Editing Method – New technology to improve genome editing, advance new possibilities for research – Creates method to rapidly deploy newly discovered bacterial CRISPR systems in disease-specific applications MilliporeSigma has developed an alternative CRISPR genome editing method that advances new possibilities for research, creating a way to rapidly deploy newly discovered bacterial CRISPR systems in disease-specific applications MilliporeSigma has developed a new genome editing tool that makes CRISPR more efficient, flexible and specific, giving researchers more experimental options and faster results that can accelerate drug development and access to new therapies – Research published in prestigious journal, Nature Communications BILLERICA, Mass., May 17, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — MilliporeSigma today has developed a new genome editing tool that makes CRISPR more efficient, flexible and specific, giving researchers more experimental options and faster results that can accelerate drug development and access to new therapies. This new technique, called „proxy-CRISPR,” provides access to previously unreachable areas of the genome. Most natural CRISPR systems, found in bacteria, cannot work in human cells without significant re-engineering. However, proxy-CRISPR provides a rapid and simple method to increase their usability without the laborious need to re-engineer native CRISPR proteins. The company has filed several patent applications on the proxy-CRISPR technology. These patent applications directed to the proxy-CRISPR technology are just some of several CRISPR patent application filings made by the company since 2012. „With more flexible and easy-to-use genome editing technologies, there is greater potential in research, bioprocessing and novel treatment modalities,” said Udit Batra, CEO, MilliporeSigma. „As a leader in genome editing, MilliporeSigma’s new technology is just one example of our commitment to solving challenges in the genome editing field, and we will continue to make CRISPR research a priority.” MilliporeSigma’s research on proxy-CRISPR, „Targeted Activation of Diverse CRISPR-Cas Systems for Mammalian Genome Editing via Proximal CRISPR Targeting,” was published in the April 7, 2017 edition of Nature Communications. The article explains how to make CRISPR more efficient, flexible and specific by opening up the genome for the cutting of DNA, giving researchers more editing options. CRISPR genome editing technology is advancing treatment options for some of the toughest medical conditions faced today, including chronic illnesses and cancers for which there are limited or no treatment options. The applications of CRISPR are far ranging—from identifying genes associated with cancer to reversing mutations that cause blindness. CRISPR enables genome editing using an enzyme called Cas9 to cut DNA, but this has limited targeting abilities. This limitation led to MilliporeSigma’s focus on proxy-CRISPR. MilliporeSigma has a 14-year history in the genome editing field, and was the first company to globally offer custom biomolecules for genome editing (TargeTron™ biomolecules and zinc finger nucleases), driving adoption of these techniques within the global research community. MilliporeSigma was also the first to manufacture arrayed CRISPR libraries covering the entire human genome, accelerating cures for diseases by allowing researchers to explore more questions about the root causes. MilliporeSigma supports development gene- and cell-based therapeutics and manufactures viral vectors, as well. In 2016, the company launched a genome editing initiative aimed at advancing research in this area through a dedicated team and enhanced resources, further solidifying the company’s commitment to this field. The new technology is a follow-on to MilliporeSigma’s existing CRISPR applications. The company’s next suite of genome editing tools for the research community, to be launched later in 2017, will include novel and modified versions of Cas and Cas-like proteins. MilliporeSigma’s CRISPR Epigenetic Activator (p300-Cas9), which advances the way scientists explore epigenetic modification and associated diseases, was recognized as one of the Top 10 Innovations by The Scientist in 2015.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman MilliporeSigma Develops Alternative CRISPR Genome Editing Method - New technology to improve genome editing, advance new possibilities for research - Creates method to rapidly deploy newly discovered bacterial CRISPR systems in disease-specific applications - Research published in prestigious journal, Nature Communications BILLERICA, Mass., May 17, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- MilliporeSigma today has developed a new genome editing tool that makes CRISPR more efficient, flexible and specific, giving researchers more experimental options and faster results that can accelerate drug development and access to new therapies. This new technique, called "proxy-CRISPR," provides access to previously unreachable areas of the genome. Most natural CRISPR systems, found in bacteria, cannot work in human cells without significant re-engineering. However, proxy-CRISPR provides a rapid and simple method to increase their usability without the laborious need to re-engineer native CRISPR proteins. The company has filed several patent applications on the proxy-CRISPR technology. These patent applications directed to the proxy-CRISPR technology are just some of several CRISPR patent application filings made by the company since 2012. "With more flexible and easy-to-use genome editing technologies, there is greater potential in research, bioprocessing and novel treatment modalities," said Udit Batra, CEO, MilliporeSigma. "As a leader in genome editing, MilliporeSigma's new technology is just one example of our commitment to solving challenges in the genome editing field, and we will continue to make CRISPR research a priority." MilliporeSigma's research on proxy-CRISPR, "Targeted Activation of Diverse CRISPR-Cas Systems for Mammalian Genome Editing via Proximal CRISPR Targeting," was published in the April 7, 2017 edition of Nature Communications. The article explains how to make CRISPR more efficient, flexible and specific by opening up the genome for the cutting of DNA, giving researchers more editing options. CRISPR genome editing technology is advancing treatment options for some of the toughest medical conditions faced today, including chronic illnesses and cancers for which there are limited or no treatment options. The applications of CRISPR are far ranging—from identifying genes associated with cancer to reversing mutations that cause blindness. CRISPR enables genome editing using an enzyme called Cas9 to cut DNA, but this has limited targeting abilities. This limitation led to MilliporeSigma's focus on proxy-CRISPR. MilliporeSigma has a 14-year history in the genome editing field, and was the first company to globally offer custom biomolecules for genome editing (TargeTron™ biomolecules and zinc finger nucleases), driving adoption of these techniques within the global research community. MilliporeSigma was also the first to manufacture arrayed CRISPR libraries covering the entire human genome, accelerating cures for diseases by allowing researchers to explore more questions about the root causes. MilliporeSigma supports development gene- and cell-based therapeutics and manufactures viral vectors, as well. In 2016, the company launched a genome editing initiative aimed at advancing research in this area through a dedicated team and enhanced resources, further solidifying the company's commitment to this field. The new technology is a follow-on to MilliporeSigma's existing CRISPR applications. The company's next suite of genome editing tools for the research community, to be launched later in 2017, will include novel and modified versions of Cas and Cas-like proteins. MilliporeSigma's CRISPR Epigenetic Activator (p300-Cas9), which advances the way scientists explore epigenetic modification and associated diseases, was recognized as one of the Top 10 Innovations by The Scientist in 2015.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 May 2017 by Persistence Market Research Birth Control Implant Market to Witness Comprehensive Growth by 2016 – 2026 : Persistence Market Research Birth control implants are devices that are highly effective in preventing pregnancy for a short period. These implants are placed sub-dermally and contain progestin, release of which stops ovulation. It also leads to thickening of the vaginal fluid that avoids fertilization by preventing sperms from reaching the egg. It also causes thinning of uterine lining that makes it difficult for the fertilised egg to attach onto it. Birth control implants are reversible contraceptive birth controls and have very low failure rate and if properly placed are able to avoid pregnancy for three years. The insertion and removal of the Birth control implants are done by healthcare professional after taking into consideration several other implications such as, history of blood clots, pregnancy, diabetes, breast cancer and heart, liver or kidney problems. These Birth control implants are also often associated with certain side effects such as headaches, acne or other pains. The Birth control implants now available are of single rod devices containing progestin, however, the first contraceptive implant that was developed and marketed as Norplant consisted of 6 rods. With further studies and researches, a 2-rod system that contained levonorgestrel with name Jadelle was eventually approved by FDA but was not, however marketed in United States. Later, in 1988, a single-rod implant containing etonogestrel, named Implanon entered the international market of birth control and was widely accepted for its convenience and better results. The 6 rod system was inconvenient and had difficulty with insertion and removal and thus was eventually removed from the US market. The 2-rod implant that was easier and better than 6-rod implants has been registered in 11 countries for birth control. The Birth control implants maker, Merck & Co. is phasing out its product Implanon and replacing it with its own another product Nexplanon. The Birth control implants market is a steadily growing market owing to the rise in awareness among people for birth control measures. The rise in the number of people undergoing treatments and the steady increase in the procedural volume implies that the market will be pushed further up in the forthcoming years. With not much competitors and products in the birth control implants market, the established key players have an added advantage. Technological innovations will keep driving the birth control implant market. However, the regulations related to the approval of the Birth control implants tend to restrain the market. The cost of these birth control implants and their inability for protection against STD’s act as another drawback. Advancements such as Nexplanon, which was launched in 2011 by Merck & Co. at United States. The Worldwide sales of Birth control implants by Merck & Co., that consist of Implanon and Nexplanon rose to $588 million in the year 2015 which indicates a 17% increase compared to 2014. This implies that these birth control products have a higher demand in the United States and the emerging markets. The birth control implant Jadelle, was developed and licensed by The Population Council. Further research and development activities pertaining to birth control implants are being undertaken with partnership with WomanCare Global. In 2016, Bayer announced its birth control implant Jadelle will be available at half the price until 2023, in order to cater to the needs of the poor. Thus, focusing and expanding its customer base to the emerging economies.  Other birth control implants, such as Nesterone™ and Capronor™ comprising of different progestins, and biodegradable rods, pellets or microcapsules are under developmental stages. A Sample of this Report is Available Upon Request @ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/12052 Geographically, Birth control implants is classified into regions viz. North America, Latin America, Europe, APAJ, Middle East and Africa. North America and Europe will remain key markets for Birth control implants due to rising awareness about the better results, hence a proportional increase in treatment procedures.

"The side effects are real bad," he said, but the medication is effective. by Don Sapatkin, Inquirer Staff Writer Roughly two million to three million baby boomers are chronically infected with hepatitis C, putting them at risk of serious liver damage if left untreated. Dramatic improvements in what is now a very unpleasant drug regimen are expected over the next several years. Should they wait? Before deciding that this story doesn't apply to you, note that chronic hepatitis C can lie dormant for decades with no symptoms. Most people who have it are unaware of the infection. So the first step is to get a blood test, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last month proposed recommending for everyone born from 1945 to 1965. If it's positive, the short answer about what to do next is - sorry - ask your doctor. People with significant liver disease need to be treated now while others may have reason to hold off. But physicians say that complexities of the condition, other medical issues, classes of drugs and their side effects mean that patients should not attempt to choose on their own. "This is a rapidly evolving field," said Rajender Reddy, director of hepatology for the University of Pennsylvania Health System, where about a dozen different drug combinations are in clinical trials. Baby boomers account for more than 75 percent of Americans infected with the blood-borne virus. That's partly because transfusions and blood products weren't screened until 1992 but mostly due to drug use with shared needles, even just once or twice, as teenagers or young adults. After years of chronic infection, more and more people are arriving at hepatologists' offices with advanced liver disease, which also makes the underlying virus harder to suppress. But there have been plenty of reasons to avoid treatment. The longtime standard regimen - weekly injections of immune-boosting pegylated interferon plus twice-daily ribavirin pills - takes 48 weeks, causes nasty side effects, and works less than 50 percent of the time. In May 2011, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first changes in a decade: adding to the standard either Merck's Victrelis (also called boceprevir) or Vertex Pharmaceuticals' Incivek (telaprevir). The direct-acting antivirals nearly doubled the percentage of patients whose virus was reduced to undetectable levels, essentially a cure. In the case of telaprevir, the duration of treatment for some patients was cut to 24 weeks or less. "They work well but many people either can't take them because of contraindications like depression or won't take them because of the side effects," said Mark Sulkowski, medical director of the Viral Hepatitis center at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, whose data on the next generation of drugs energized a conference in Barcelona, Spain, two months ago. Side effects, mostly from the interferon, include fatigue, flu-like symptoms, personality changes, sleep disturbances, and on and on. People with severe depression or anemia, autoimmune diseases, and decompensated cirrhosis are ineligible. So are the 25 percent of infected people in this country whose virus is not genotype 1. Hep C was not a big surprise for Samuel Morales, 55. He'd used heroin for much of his life and also has hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and HIV, all of which are more easily treated than hep C (there are vaccines against A and B). They often run together in high-risk groups like prisoners. Morales said he got clean in prison in 1993. The hepatitis infections were discovered when he got a liver biopsy around 2000. Because the treatments then were not very effective, he said, his doctor suggested he wait for something better. His genotype 2 infection, which is more common among intravenous drug users, ruled out the drugs approved last year. A biopsy several months ago that showed worsening cirrhosis - he has never felt symptoms - led his doctor to urge treatment with the old drugs now. "The side effects are real bad. You get depressed, you don't eat, you get diarrhea, you get cold, you get hot, like a woman going through PMS, it is really bad. Your joints, they hurt, you know," said Morales. His infectious-disease doctor at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center required weekly sessions with a therapist and monthly with a psychiatrist, who prescribed Celexa to manage depression. "But when you get the results back from the blood work and you see your body viral load is down to 'undetected,' it is worth all that struggle," said Morales, who is three months into what is likely to be nearly a yearlong course of treatment. He has been volunteering with organizations near his North Philadelphia home, encouraging people to get tested for hepatitis C. Many of those who are positive will have more options than he did. Dozens of drugs are in development, and researchers expect several to reach the market within two to five years. The first, like the two drugs approved last year, will probably be protease inhibitors for genotype 1; they will still require shots of interferon to help the immune system fight the virus. After that, however, are several drugs that in small trials have been powerful enough to work without the immune system booster, and with far fewer side effects. Like the drug "cocktails" used to treat HIV, these are given in combination, disrupting the virus' life cycle at different points, so that it cannot mutate and replicate. The most promising results presented at a recent liver conference in Barcelona were from a combination of GS-7977, a polymerase inhibitor owned by Gilead Sciences Inc., and daclatasivir, a Bristol-Myers Squibb drug that is part of a class known as NS5A inhibitors. One pill a day of each drove the virus to undetectable levels in all 29 patients with genotype 1, the most common in the U.S., and 28 out of 30 patients with genotypes 2 and 3. That finding, while dramatic, was just four weeks after a 24-week course of treatment (a 12-week course is being tested as well). Because of relapses, doctors don't normally consider a patient cured until 12 to 24 weeks after completion. But they are a sign of the future. Reddy, who is medical director of Penn's liver transplant program, said that deciding whether to get treated with the older drugs now or wait for a future generation is a balancing act. When a biopsy shows significant liver disease, "we say 'hey, you've got to get treated.' But if a patient has relatively mild disease," he said, the ordeal of current treatments may tip the scale. "The side effects are not easy to handle if you don't have a support system." Reddy was involved with trials of both drugs approved last year and is currently testing the most promising new drugs and others in various combinations in people infected with different genotypes who have failed previous treatments and in others who have never tried them. The complexity of the treatments, along with rising numbers of people who need them, have led the Penn, Temple and Jefferson health systems to create viral hepatitis centers, with others likely soon. Because these centers also run clinical trials, some patients who are weighing approved drugs now vs. later may have a third choice. "It's a good time to come out of the woodwork, get your diagnosis and get treated," said Jonathan Fenkel, director of the Hepatitis C Center at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital.   Coming Monday Researchers who are seeking to unravel the mysteries of aging have yet to find the legendary fountain of youth, but they have uncovered intriguing clues to living longer, healthier lives.

Albertina Torsoli With $4 billion annual budget, WHO’s influence extends to virtually all of humanity, from food quality and environmental hazards to immunizations and the response to pandemics. Photo: Bloomberg Geneva: The World Health Organization’s 194 member-states will vote for a new director-general next week, choosing a doctor to lead the planet’s top technical agency on all matters health. With a $4 billion annual budget, WHO’s influence extends to virtually all of humanity, from food quality and environmental hazards to immunizations and the response to pandemics. One of three candidates will be elected at the Palais des Nations in Geneva on 23 May for a five-year term to provide the leadership, muster the resources, and implement the strategies that are central to global health, security, and development. Nominees to succeed current Director-General Margaret Chan on 1 July are David Nabarro (UK); Sania Nishtar (Pakistan); and Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (Ethiopia). Whoever wins the top spot will also need to drum up financial support for the beleaguered, 69-year-old agency after the Trump Administration flagged reducing funding to the United Nations, of which the WHO is part. 1. Pandemic warnings WHO decides when to raise the alarm on pandemics and international health emergencies, which influence governments’ decisions on everything from pharmaceutical purchases to travel policies. The response to disease threats resonates across industries, especially aviation, tourism, insurance and re-insurance, whose businesses are among the hardest hit during major disease outbreaks. West Africa’s Ebola epidemic in 2014-15 cost Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone a combined $2.8 billion, the World Bank estimated. 2. Controlling tobacco WHO sets enforceable rules on tobacco control, restricting the way cigarette makers can advertise, promote, and market their products, making the agency’s policies especially important to companies such as Philip Morris International Inc., British American Tobacco Plc, Japan Tobacco Inc. and Imperial Brands Plc. 3. Healthy diets WHO makes dietary and nutrition recommendations aimed at tackling conditions from obesity and hypertension to stroke and heart attack. Salt and sugar targets influence the ingredients of foods and beverages, including those made by Nestle SA, Unilever, General Mills Inc., Kellogg Co., PepsiCo Inc. and the Coca-Cola Co. 4. Procuring medicines WHO formulates a model list of essential medicines that recommend the most important drugs governments should stock for the health of their people. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can get a sales boost from having a product added to the list. The list is especially important for makers of generic medications, such as Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, Mylan NV, Novartis AG’s Sandoz unit and Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. WHO is pushing for wider access to ground-breaking new treatments for hepatitis C, cancer, and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, and is lobbying to make the medicines more affordable—an effort that has ramifications for drugmakers such as Gilead Sciences Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Roche Holding AG and AstraZeneca Plc. It also helps other UN agencies procure billions of dollars of pharmaceutical products by vetting manufacturers to ensure they meet WHO standards and specifications. 5. Health-insurance for all WHO is helping governments achieve universal health coverage by 2030 with the goal of ensuring even the poorest people have access to safe and effective essential services and treatment. Already, governments are being encouraged to have sufficient high-priority equipment on hand, including endoscopes, imaging and scanning machines, linear accelerators for radiotherapy, and other devices made by companies from Becton, Dickinson & Co. and Medtronic Plc, to Olympus Corp. and Siemens AG. 6. Breast is best WHO sets standards for the marketing of breast-milk substitutes that restrict some promotional practices of infant-formula makers, which include Nestle SA, Danone and Mead Johnson Nutrition Co., which is being acquired by Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc. 7. Calling the shots WHO scrutinizes the safety and efficacy of vaccines, and makes recommendations on which ones should be routinely administered to children, which ones should be stockpiled, and which ones should be developed for future use. Immunization recommendations are important for vaccine makers, including Merck & Co., Sanofi, GlaxoSmithKline Plc, Pfizer Inc. and the Serum Institute of India Pvt. 8. Saving antibiotics WHO is trying to stave off resistance to antimicrobial medicines, including broad-spectrum antibiotics that are losing their potency because of overuse. The agency is also encouraging the development of new infection-fighting medicines. Working with veterinary, food and agriculture organizations, WHO is pushing for restrictions on the use of critically important antibiotics in food and livestock production that have relevance for food retailers, such as McDonald’s Corp. and Yum! Brands Inc., as well as Merck & Co., Bayer AG, Zoetis Inc. and other companies with animal-health interests. 9. Battling the bottle WHO is tackling the harmful use of alcohol, helping governments implement policies that curb excessive boozing and communicate its public health risks—a program with implications for beverage companies such as Diageo Plc, Pernod Ricard SA, Anheuser-Busch InBev NV and Carlsberg A/S in Europe to Suntory Holdings Ltd and Asahi Group Holdings Ltd. 10. Labelling carcinogens WHO reviews scientific evidence to appraise the cancer-risk of everything from agricultural chemicals, such as Monsanto Co.’s Roundup, and 2,4-D made by companies including Dow Chemical Co. and Nufarm Ltd., to drinking scalding-hot beverages, and eating red meat. “There is enormous interest in the business community about global health security,” said Lawrence Gostin, the Founding O’Neill Chair in Global Health Law at Washington’s Georgetown University. “Because of disruption in markets and consumer behaviour, the potential for restrictions on travel, trade and tourism can make a huge difference.” Bloomberg Albertina Torsoli Topics: WHO WHO director general PepsiCo Pfizer Margaret Chan More From Livemint READ MORE United Breweries shares tank 5% after Q4 profit drops sharply GST Council meeting: Kerala demands 5% tax on jewellery Google Photos is now more intelligent, but will it nag incessantly?

Saving Antibiotics Broiler chicks drink water at a poultry farm in Telangana, India. Photographer: Dhiraj Singh/Bloomberg WHO is trying to stave off resistance to antimicrobial medicines, including broad-spectrum antibiotics that are losing their potency because of overuse. The agency is also encouraging the development of new infection-fighting medicines. Working with veterinary, food and agriculture organizations, WHO is pushing for restrictions on the use of critically important antibiotics in food and livestock production that have relevance for food retailers, such as McDonald’s Corp. and Yum! Brands Inc., as well as Merck & Co., Bayer AG, Zoetis Inc. and other companies with animal-health interests. 9. Battling the Bottle WHO is tackling the harmful use of alcohol, helping governments implement policies that curb excessive boozing and communicate its public health risks -- a program with implications for beverage companies such as Diageo Plc, Pernod Ricard SA,  Anheuser-Busch InBev NV and Carlsberg A/S in Europe to Suntory Holdings Ltd. and Asahi Group Holdings Ltd. 10.

These data and conclusions should be considered to be preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) appeared to be highly effective in preventing the oral infections that can lead to oropharyngeal cancer. Note that so far the population impact of the vaccine has been small, mainly because of low use of the vaccine during the years of the study. CHICAGO -- Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) appeared to be highly effective in preventing the oral infections that can lead to oropharyngeal cancer, a researcher said. Among young people who had received at least one shot of the quadrivalent vaccine in the years 2011 through 2014, the prevalence of infection by one of the four vaccine strains was 88% lower than it was among those who were unvaccinated, according to Maura Gillison, MD, PhD, of the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. The study was conducted while Gillison was at the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center in Columbus. The finding suggests the vaccine has "a tremendous potential to prevent oral infections," Gillison said during a webcast media briefing in advance of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting. But she told reporters that so far the population impact of the vaccine has been small, mainly because of low use of the vaccine during the years of the study. From 2011 through 2014, her group estimated that there were some 927,401 vaccine-preventable oral HPV infections -- but just 17% of those, some 169,650 cases, were actually averted. But there is cause for "considerable optimism," she said, because recent reports suggest uptake of HPV vaccines among girls and boys under 18 is increasing, to about 60% and 40%, respectively, compared with just 25% and 7% in the study population. The vaccines are indicated to prevent cervical and anal infections, but not oral infections, at least partly because no large studies have suggested the drug is effective, Gillison said. The findings are "encouraging," commented ASCO President-Elect Bruce Johnson, MD, of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, who was one of the co-moderators of the ASCO briefing. "One of the first steps in preventing cancer is to first prevent the infection," he said. The study shows "you can indeed prevent infection." Gillison's group conducted a cross-sectional study among 2,627 men and women, ages 18-33 years, who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) for 2011 through 2014. They looked at the prevalence of oral infection with the HPV vaccine serotypes -- 16, 18, 6 and 11 -- among participants who reported they had received at least dose of the drug, compared with those who said they had not. All participants gave an oral rinse that Gillison's group evaluated for the presence of HPV. They found that 18.3% reported receipt of at least one shot, including 29.2% of women and 6.9% % of men. Overall, 0.11% of those who reported vaccination had one of the vaccine strains, compared with 1.6% of those who did not, a difference that was statistically significant. Among men, who have the greatest burden of oral HPV infection, the respective rates were 0.0% and 2.1%, also a significant difference. Gillison cautioned that the study was not a prospective randomized clinical trial and can say nothing about cause and effect. But the findings suggest that HPV vaccines "might have benefits beyond prevention of anogenital cancers," she added. The study looked at just four serotypes thought to cause most oral and anogenital cancers, but a new vaccine introduced in 2016 contains those four and an additional five. One objection sometimes raised in the discussion of HPV vaccines is based on the normal immune response to the virus: in most cases, the infection is cleared relatively quickly. Gillison said the difficulty is that there's currently no way to tell who will clear the virus, and who will go on to have a chronic infection and therefore be at risk for cancer. "That's why there is a current recommendation for universal vaccination of young girls and boys," she told MedPage Today. The study is evidence that the vaccine is effective in preventing oral infection, which renders the immune response unnecessary, commented Richard Schilsky, MD, ASCO senior vice president and chief medical officer. "The bottom line [is that] the vaccine works if you get it but if you don't get it, it can't help you," he told MedPage Today. The study was supported by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research. Gillison disclosed relevant relationships with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Lilly, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), AstraZeneca, Merck, Celgene, Amtene, and Kyowa Hakko Kirin. Johnson dislcosed relevant relationships with KEW Group, Chugai Pharma, Merck, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Clovis Oncology, Genentech, GSK, Lilly, Novartis, and Transgene. Schilsky disclosed relevant relationships with AstraZeneca, Bayer, BMS, Genentech/Roche, Lilly, Merck, and Pfizer.

Radiation and chemotherapy could no longer contain her stage 4 bladder cancer.  But there was a ray of hope. Baker’s oncologist at Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center referred her to a clinical trial at UConn Health involving two immunotherapy drugs: the FDA-approved Keytruda (pembrolizumab) from Merck & Co., credited with successfully treating former President Jimmy Carter’s melanoma; and Epacadostat (IDO1 inhibitor), an experimental drug from Incyte Corp. “There was nothing else out there for me,” Baker said.

The exchange-traded fund is what is known today as a passive fund, meaning that it tracks an index and holds similar stocks to replicate the performance. Passive funds have been the way to go for a number of years, and VHT is no exception. Its averaged nearly 17% annually for the past five years and nearly 10% annually since its inception in 2004. And during these time frames it has regularly outperformed the index it’s tracking. What’s more, like all Vanguard funds, its expense ratio is unbelievably low, which means you get to keep more of the returns. VHT annual expenses are 0.1%. Its competitors’ average expenses are 1.33%. That’s an order of magnitude difference. And over time that really adds up. For example, over 10 years, you end up paying 1% of your returns to expenses or 13.3%. This is what makes Vanguard funds so compelling for long-term investors. Great performance at industry-low costs. Its portfolio is well positioned for whatever happens with Obamacare in coming quarters. One-third of the stocks are pharmaceuticals. Its top three holdings are Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK). There’s only one insurance company in its top 10 holdings, powerhouse UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH). The insurers are the sector that will undergo the most transition in any new healthcare legislation that get passed since they will be the ones offering the plans and figuring out their margins on a new system. “Trumpcare” may work in their favor, but the uncertainty in the meantime will not help them. The drug companies, especially the big ones, are less prone to market shocks with any new Trumpcare legislation since they have longstanding deals on their biggest selling drugs. Any changes would be years off. Bottom Line on the VHT ETF VHT also has a sizable position in healthcare equipment firms. This market is the biggest growth engine in the sector, as China looks to build out its healthcare system and needs to buy equipment now so it can provide for its citizens. Only after building its knowledge base on operating, maintaining and installing this equipment will it be able to build its own domestic healthcare equipment firms. This first wave will be established Western equipment firms with the ability to serve a massive market like China. Year to date, VHT is up 10% and has an unremarkable 1.3% dividend. But considering basement expense ratio, that dividend pays the expenses with plenty to spare, unlike its competitors. There is plenty of growth left in this quality ETF.

Obtain Report Details @ http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/patient-handling-equipment-market.html Increasing Programs for Advanced Nursing to Encourage Market Growth A tremendous rise in geriatric population worldwide and the rising incidence of several disabilities due to non-communicable diseases are some of the vital factors that are projected to fuel the growth of the global patient handling equipment market. In addition, the rising risks of injuries to caregivers while handling patients is predicted to boost the demand for patient handling equipment in the coming years. On the flip side, the lack of training that is to be provided to caregivers in order to ensure efficient operation of patient handling equipment is likely to restrict the growth of the overall market in the coming years. Moreover, several issues related to the handling of bariatric patients are anticipated to hamper the market’s growth in the near future. Nonetheless, the emergence of private institutional nursing and the entry of several prominent players are predicted to accelerate the growth of the patient handling equipment market in the next few years. Developing Medical Tourism Sector to Generate Promising Opportunities in Asia Pacific From a geographical perspective, in the last few years, Europe led the global patient handling equipment market and accounted for a large share.

The rising popularity of medical tourism and the growing pool of patients are the key factors that are estimated to encourage the growth of this segment in the next few years. Furthermore, the patient handling equipment market is expected to experience a healthy growth throughout the forecast period in the Middle East and Africa and Latin America. The improving lifestyle of consumers and the rising preference of consumers to spend on healthcare are some of the major factors that are predicted to encourage the growth of these two regions in the next few years. However, the high cost of equipment is considered to act as a key challenge, especially in developing and under-developed economies. Introduction of New Products to Create Lucrative Opportunities The key players in the global patient handling equipment market are emphasizing on innovations in order to attract a large number of consumers worldwide. Wheelchairs, bath, shower, and toileting equipment, lifting slings, ambulatory aids, and medical beds are some of the leading products of the market. The expansion of the application base is predicted to generate promising growth opportunities over the forecast period. This is expected to benefit the market players in enhancing their presence and gain a competitive advantage in the coming years.

By Noel K. GallagherPortland Press Herald Email Writer 207-791-6387 Share Comment Read Article Alison Grott Bonney and Michael Bonney, 1980 Bates College graduates, gave the college $10 million last year, and now have donated a record $50 million. A Maine family with fourth-generation ties to Bates College has donated $50 million to the Lewiston school, the largest single gift in its history and probably the largest cash gift to a college in Maine, campus officials said. The donation came from Alison Grott Bonney and Michael Bonney, who both graduated from Bates in 1980. “I believe that never in the history of the liberal arts tradition has a liberal arts education been more critical, when one thinks about the future of our society, than today,” Michael Bonney said. The gift was announced as part of a five-year, $300 million capital campaign, the largest capital campaign in the school’s history. “This campaign will be transformational for Bates,” President Clayton Spencer said Tuesday night at a campaign kickoff event held at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. “The Bates Campaign provides us with the opportunity to secure the programs and values that have defined Bates for a century and a half and to shape new strategies for a new age,” she said. Last year the Bonneys gave a $10 million gift, which was the largest single gift in the history of Bates at the time. Related Bates College announces largest-ever single gift – $19 million Other Maine colleges have received large donations, sometimes in objects, not cash. In February, the Colby College Museum of Art received its second gift of art valued at more than $100 million from longtime supporters Peter and Paula Lunder, which will launch the Lunder Institute for American Art. Also this year, Colby received $25 million from the Davis Family Foundation to fund study abroad opportunities, and $10 million from Portland developer Joseph Boulos toward a new athletic complex. Related Portland developer Joe Boulos, Sheri Boulos give Colby College $10 million Last year, Bowdoin College in Brunswick received a $10 million gift from college trustee David Roux and his wife, Barbara, to build a new center for studying the environment. The University of Maine and University of Southern Maine are both launching major capital campaigns this spring. Colby is also in fundraising mode this year, having recently announced it already had raised $100 million toward a $200 million state-of-the-art athletic center on campus that will include the state’s first Olympic-size swimming pool. Michael Bonney has served as a Bates trustee since 2002 and as board chairman since 2010. The Bonney family has ties to Bates going back to the 1920s, when Michael Bonney’s maternal grandfather graduated in 1927. Michael and Alison’s three children all graduated from Bates. Their $50 million gift, from the Bonneys’ family foundation, will help build new facilities and renovate existing science, technology, engineering and math facilities. After graduating from Bates with a degree in economics, Michael Bonney began his career with Maine-based Hannaford Brothers, working in the supermarket chain’s pharmacy operation. He worked at several pharmaceutical companies before retiring in 2014 as CEO and director of Cubist Pharmaceuticals, which was acquired by Merck for $9.5 billion. Bates spokeswoman Marjorie Hall said the college already has raised $168 million toward the capital campaign. Of the $300 million goal, $75 million is earmarked for financial aid; $100 million for academic programs, including $24 million for eight endowed professorships; $65 million for student programs, including $25 million for athletics and $24 million for internship and work-related programs; and $60 million for the endowment and annual fund. Bates’ endowment, as of last June, was $251 million, Hall said. Bates College has about 1,800 students, and tuition, fees, room and board are $66,720 a year. In the incoming class this year, 42 percent received need-based financial aid. Bates has been open to men and women from all racial, ethnic and religious backgrounds since its founding by Maine abolitionists in 1855. Noel K.

Globally, the human insulin market is witnessing significant growth due to increasing prevalence of diabetes and increasing awareness among people about diabetes care. In addition, technological advancements in insulin delivery devices and increasing prevalence of lifestyle related disorders such as obesity are also driving the growth of the market. However, uneven pricing and limited access to human insulin in emerging countries such as Brazil, India, and China are inhibiting the growth of the human insulin market. In addition, strict regulatory requirements for drug approval are also restraining the growth of the market. The global human insulin market was anticipated to grow from an estimated USD 24,332.6 million in 2014 to USD 49,197.3 million in 2020 at a CAGR of 12.4% during the forecast period. In North America, increasing prevalence of diabetes with growing age and availability of advanced human insulin infusion devices are driving the use of human insulin in the market. In addition, increasing prevalence of lifestyle associated disorders such as obesity is also boosting the growth of the human insulin market in this region. For instance, according to the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC), a U.S.-based national public health institute, over one-third children and adolescents were obese in 2012 in the U.S. In Europe, the human insulin market is driven by rising aging population and increasing prevalence of diabetes. In addition, in Germany the market is evolving due to rising prevalence of diabetes and increasing awareness among people about diabetes care. However, in Asia-Pacific the growth for human insulin is much higher than developed countries due to increasing prevalence of diabetes and increasing government initiatives for improving healthcare.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Antidepressants Market: New Tech Developments and Advancements to Watch Out for 2024 Antidepressants are drugs used for the treatment of depressive disorders including dysthymia, obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety, chronic pain, eating disorders, and neuropathic pain. Depression is a medical disorder which is related to the brain. Symptoms of depression include feeling sad and tired, lacking energy, and having difficulty enjoying routine daily activities. According to CDC, depression affects about 1 in every 5 individuals in the U.S. According to WHO (World Health Organization), at present an estimated 350 million people worldwide are affected by depression. Depression affects 10% to 15% men and about 10% to 25% of women. Browse Market Research Report @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/antidepressants-market… The antidepressants market has been segmented based on the drug classes commonly used for the treatment of various types of depressive disorders. There are different types of antidepressant drugs available in the market such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (RIMA), tetracyclic antidepressants, etc. The different types of antidepressants are used in the treatment of depressive disorders. The different classes of antidepressants are as effective as each other, but some patients respond better to one antidepressant compared to another antidepressant. Side effects can also be different between these groups of antidepressants. Different types of depression disorders include dysthymic disorder, postpartum depression, psychotic depression, major or clinical depressive disorder, and seasonal affective disorder. Factors driving the antidepressants market are declining side effects and rising efficacy of drugs in various classes as well as growing geriatric population where rate of mental illness is higher. However, the overall antidepressants market growth would decrease due to patent expiry of key antidepressants, fragile pipeline of new drugs, increasing number of generic drug alternatives, and growing prevalence of treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders. Region wise, the global fermented ingredients market is segmented into five regions; North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East & Africa. North America is the most dominant market for antidepressants due to the presence of a large patient population suffering from various types of anxiety disorders and depression. However, the antidepressants market in the U.S. is currently saturated, as several antidepressant drugs are available on prescription for the same indication. Hence, the future growth of the market would depend on introduction of efficacious drugs for new indications. Moreover, loss of patent exclusivity, market maturity, generic infiltration, and shortened drug lifecycles are the additional factors that contribute to the decline in market growth in the region. Asia Pacific is expected to witness appreciable growth due to multiple factors such as high prevalence of psychiatric disorders and rapid economic growth in countries such as China, Japan, and Australia. Additionally, positive marketing approval for innovative medicines is likely to drive the market in the near future. For more information on this report, fill the form @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Currently, the market is highly fragmented and competitive in nature due to the involvement of both large and small pharmaceutical companies. AstraZeneca plc, Eli Lilly and Company, Forest Laboratories, GlaxoSmithKline plc, H. Lundbeck A/S, Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Co., Inc., Pfizer, Inc. and Sanofi S.A. are major companies operating in the antidepressants market. Majority of the market players are focusing on expanding distribution network as well as expanding geographical presence, as Asia Pacific, the Middle East& Africa, and Latin America are developing regions with an increasing prevalence of various types of depressive disorders and improving economic conditions. Differences in clinical efficacy between drugs are generally small because most modern antidepressants work through a common biological mechanism. As a result, drug makers use direct-to-consumer advertising and tweak side effect profiles in order to differentiate their products.

By Noel K. GallagherStaff Writer Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Email Writer 207-791-6387 Share Comment Read Article Alison Grott Bonney and Michael Bonney, 1980 Bates College graduates, gave the college $10 million last year, and now have donated a record $50 million. A Maine family with fourth-generation ties to Bates College has donated $50 million to the Lewiston school, the largest single gift in its history and probably the largest cash gift to a college in Maine, campus officials said. The donation came from Alison Grott Bonney and Michael Bonney, who both graduated from Bates in 1980. “I believe that never in the history of the liberal arts tradition has a liberal arts education been more critical, when one thinks about the future of our society, than today,” Michael Bonney said. The gift was announced as part of a five-year, $300 million capital campaign, the largest capital campaign in the school’s history. “This campaign will be transformational for Bates,” President Clayton Spencer said Tuesday night at a campaign kickoff event held at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. “The Bates Campaign provides us with the opportunity to secure the programs and values that have defined Bates for a century and a half and to shape new strategies for a new age,” she said. Last year the Bonneys gave a $10 million gift, which was the largest single gift in the history of Bates at the time. Related Bates College announces largest-ever single gift – $19 million Other Maine colleges have received large donations, sometimes in objects, not cash. In February, the Colby College Museum of Art received its second gift of art valued at more than $100 million from longtime supporters Peter and Paula Lunder, which will launch the Lunder Institute for American Art. Also this year, Colby received $25 million from the Davis Family Foundation to fund study abroad opportunities, and $10 million from Portland developer Joseph Boulos toward a new athletic complex. Related Portland developer Joe Boulos, Sheri Boulos give Colby College $10 million Last year, Bowdoin College in Brunswick received a $10 million gift from college trustee David Roux and his wife, Barbara, to build a new center for studying the environment. The University of Maine and University of Southern Maine are both launching major capital campaigns this spring. Colby is also in fundraising mode this year, having recently announced it already had raised $100 million toward a $200 million state-of-the-art athletic center on campus that will include the state’s first Olympic-size swimming pool. Michael Bonney has served as a Bates trustee since 2002 and as board chairman since 2010. The Bonney family has ties to Bates going back to the 1920s, when Michael Bonney’s maternal grandfather graduated in 1927. Michael and Alison’s three children all graduated from Bates. Their $50 million gift, from the Bonneys’ family foundation, will help build new facilities and renovate existing science, technology, engineering and math facilities. After graduating from Bates with a degree in economics, Michael Bonney began his career with Maine-based Hannaford Brothers, working in the supermarket chain’s pharmacy operation. He worked at several pharmaceutical companies before retiring in 2014 as CEO and director of Cubist Pharmaceuticals, which was acquired by Merck for $9.5 billion. Bates spokeswoman Marjorie Hall said the college already has raised $168 million toward the capital campaign. Of the $300 million goal, $75 million is earmarked for financial aid; $100 million for academic programs, including $24 million for eight endowed professorships; $65 million for student programs, including $25 million for athletics and $24 million for internship and work-related programs; and $60 million for the endowment and annual fund. Bates’ endowment, as of last June, was $251 million, Hall said. Bates College has about 1,800 students, and tuition, fees, room and board are $66,720 a year. In the incoming class this year, 42 percent received need-based financial aid. Bates has been open to men and women from all racial, ethnic and religious backgrounds since its founding by Maine abolitionists in 1855. Noel K.

These cancers are rising fast, especially in men, and research suggests that HPV, the human papillomavirus, is spreading through oral sex. The actor Michael Douglas brought attention to this risk several years ago when he blamed his cancer on it. This is the first study of whether the vaccine might prevent oral HPV infections in young men, and the results suggest it can. No men who had received at least one dose were later found to have infections of HPV strains linked to cancer, but more than 2 percent of unvaccinated men had them. “There may be additional benefits to vaccinating your son or daughter” besides the problems the vaccine already is known to prevent, said Dr. Maura Gillison of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Results were released Wednesday by the American Society of Clinical Oncology ahead of presentation at its annual meeting next month. The virus HPV is very common — most sexually active people have been exposed to it. Some types cause genital warts. Usually, the virus causes no symptoms and goes away, but some people develop long-lasting infections of strains that can cause cancer. The vaccine was approved in 2006 to prevent cervical cancers in women, and later, for some others including anal cancer in men. But acceptance has been slow — only about half of those eligible are getting it now, according to the latest information. Now, awareness is growing of HPV’s other risks — oral infections are blamed for 70 percent of cancers in the mouth and back of the throat. About 11,600 of these occur each year in the U.S. and rates are rising 5 percent per year. They are four times more common in men than women. There are now more mouth and throat cancers caused by HPV in the U.S. each year than there are cervical cancers. Oral sex is the main risk factor for getting an HPV infection in the mouth or throat, Gillison said. While “oral sex does not give you cancer,” the infection in rare cases can develop into cancer over many years, she explained. The study She led the study, funded by the National Cancer Institute, while previously at Ohio State University. Researchers interviewed 2,627 men and women ages 18 to 33 years in a national health study from 2011 to 2014 about whether they had been vaccinated, and tested oral rinse samples from them for HPV. Infections with worrisome HPV strains were found in far fewer people who had received any shots — an 88 percent lower risk. The results in men were striking — no infections in the vaccinated group versus 2.13 percent of the others. The study was observational, so it can’t prove the vaccine was responsible. But it may no longer be ethical to do an experiment where one group gets no vaccine, because its benefits for preventing other cancers is known. It might be possible to do such a study in people over 26, the age limit now for HPV vaccination, Gillison said. If a benefit were shown, it might lead to expanding the group for whom the vaccine is recommended. The bottom line is that the vaccine helps, and “so few people who should be getting it are,” said Dr. Richard Schilsky, chief medical officer of the oncology society who had no role in the study. What patients say Scott Courville wishes it existed when he was young. The 43-year-old construction inspector from St. Martinville, Louisiana, was treated last year for HPV-related tonsil cancer that spread to lymph nodes. “I went through 33 rounds of radiation and six rounds of chemotherapy,” lost 100 pounds, and now has damaged taste buds and sinuses, and constant ringing in his ears, he said. His three teenaged sons and stepsons are getting the vaccine. “There was no question at all” that they would, only how soon, he said. Tom Jackson also had an HPV-related tonsil cancer, found in 2013, and works to fight stigma over an infection that is largely sexually spread. As a school board trustee in Houston, “I believe strongly that all children should receive all vaccinations,” Jackson said. “The horror of HPV cancer is tremendous,” and not to be “whitewashed” by squeamishness or reluctance to discuss prevention, he said. The vaccines The vaccines are recommended mostly for young people, ideally before they are exposed to HPV. Merck’s Gardasil is approved in the U.S. for females 9 through 26 to prevent cervical, vulvar, vaginal and anal cancers and genital warts. For males ages 9 through 26, it is approved for preventing anal cancer and genital warts. A newer version of Gardasil that includes more HPV virus types is approved for males 9 through 15. GlaxoSmithKline’s Cervarix vaccine is approved for females 9 through 25 to prevent cervical cancer. All require two or three shots, depending on age. Other ways to help prevent oral HPV infections are limiting the number of sex partners and not smoking. Condoms or dental dams may help. Signs and symptoms of mouth and throat cancers may include a long-lasting sore throat, earaches, hoarseness, enlarged lymph nodes and pain when swallowing.

These cancers are rising fast, especially in men, and research suggests that HPV, the human papillomavirus, is spreading through oral sex. The actor Michael Douglas brought attention to this risk several years ago when he blamed his cancer on it. Advertisement This is the first study of whether the vaccine might prevent oral HPV infections in young men, and the results suggest it can. No men who had received at least one dose were later found to have infections of HPV strains linked to cancer, but more than 2 percent of unvaccinated men had them. ‘‘There may be additional benefits to vaccinating your son or daughter’’ besides the problems the vaccine already is known to prevent, Dr. Maura Gillison of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center said. Get Ground Game in your inbox: Daily updates and analysis on national politics from James Pindell. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Results were released Wednesday by the American Society of Clinical Oncology ahead of presentation at its annual meeting next month. HPV is very common — most sexually active people have been exposed to it. Some types cause genital warts. Usually, the virus causes no symptoms and goes away, but some people develop long-lasting infections of strains that can cause cancer. The vaccine was approved in 2006 to prevent cervical cancers in women, and later for some others including anal cancer in men. But acceptance has been slow — only about half of those eligible are getting it now, according to the latest information. Advertisement Now, awareness is growing of HPV’s other risks — oral infections are blamed for 70 percent of cancers in the mouth and back of the throat. About 11,600 of these occur each year in the United States, and rates are rising 5 percent per year. They’re four times more common in men than women. There are now more mouth and throat cancers caused by HPV in the United States each year than there are cervical cancers. Oral sex is the main risk factor for getting an HPV infection in the mouth or throat, Gillison said. While ‘‘oral sex does not give you cancer,’’ the infection in rare cases can develop into cancer over many years, she explained. Gillison led the study, funded by the National Cancer Institute, while previously at Ohio State University. Researchers interviewed 2,627 men and women ages 18 to 33 years in a national health study from 2011 to 2014 about whether they had been vaccinated and tested oral rinse samples from them for HPV. Infections with worrisome HPV strains were found in far fewer people who had received any shots — an 88 percent lower risk. The results in men were striking — no infections in the vaccinated group versus 2.13 percent of the others. The study was observational, so it can’t prove the vaccine was responsible. But it might no longer be ethical to do an experiment where one group gets no vaccine because its benefits for preventing other cancers is known. It might be possible to do such a study in people over 26, the age limit now for HPV vaccination, Gillison said. If a benefit were shown, it might lead to expanding the group for whom the vaccine is recommended. The bottom line is that the vaccine helps, and ‘‘so few people who should be getting it are,’’ said Dr. Richard Schilsky, chief medical officer of the oncology society who had no role in the study. ‘There may be additional benefits to vaccinating your son or daughter’ besides what the vaccine already is known to prevent. Scott Courville wishes it existed when he was young. The 43-year-old construction inspector from St. Martinville, La., was treated last year for HPV-related tonsil cancer that spread to lymph nodes. ‘‘I went through 33 rounds of radiation and six rounds of chemotherapy,’’ lost 100 pounds, and now has damaged taste buds and sinuses, and constant ringing in his ears, he said. His three teenaged sons and stepsons are getting the vaccine. ‘‘There was no question at all’’ that they would, only how soon, he said. Tom Jackson also had an HPV-related tonsil cancer, found in 2013, and works to fight stigma over an infection that is largely sexually spread. As a school board trustee in Houston, ‘‘I believe strongly that all children should receive all vaccinations,’’ Jackson said. ‘‘The horror of HPV cancer is tremendous,’’ and not to be ‘‘whitewashed’’ by squeamishness or reluctance to discuss prevention, he said. The vaccines are recommended mostly for young people, ideally before they’re exposed to HPV. Merck’s Gardasil is approved in the United States for females 9 through 26 to prevent cervical, vulvar, vaginal, and anal cancers, and genital warts. For males ages 9 through 26, it’s approved for preventing anal cancer and genital warts. A newer version of Gardasil that includes more HPV virus types is approved for males 9 through 15. GlaxoSmithKline’s Cervarix vaccine is approved for females 9 through 25 to prevent cervical cancer. All require two or three shots, depending on age. Other ways to help prevent oral HPV infections are limiting the number of sex partners and not smoking. Condoms or dental dams might help. Signs and symptoms of mouth and throat cancers may include a long-lasting sore throat, earaches, hoarseness, enlarged lymph nodes, and pain when swallowing. Loading comments...

Yes No View Results  Loading ... Follow @LethHerald on twitter By Marilynn Marchione, The Associated Press on May 17, 2017.

He said doctors told him the cancer could haven taken away his voice. (AP Photo/ John L. Mone) The HPV vaccine that helps prevent cervical cancer in women also might lower the risk in young men of oral infections that can cause mouth and throat cancers, a new study finds. These cancers are rising fast, especially in men, and research suggests that HPV, the human papillomavirus, is spreading through oral sex. The actor Michael Douglas brought attention to this risk several years ago when he blamed his cancer on it. This is the first study of whether the vaccine might prevent oral HPV infections in young men, and the results suggest it can. No men who had received at least one dose were later found to have infections of HPV strains linked to cancer, but more than 2 per cent of unvaccinated men had them. “There may be additional benefits to vaccinating your son or daughter” besides the problems the vaccine already is known to prevent, said Dr. Maura Gillison of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Results were released Wednesday by the American Society of Clinical Oncology ahead of presentation at its annual meeting next month. THE VIRUS HPV is very common – most sexually active people have been exposed to it. Some types cause genital warts. Usually, the virus causes no symptoms and goes away, but some people develop long-lasting infections of strains that can cause cancer. The vaccine was approved in 2006 to prevent cervical cancers in women, and later, for some others including anal cancer in men. But acceptance has been slow – only about half of those eligible are getting it now, according to the latest information. Now, awareness is growing of HPV’s other risks – oral infections are blamed for 70 per cent of cancers in the mouth and back of the throat. About 11,600 of these occur each year in the U.S. and rates are rising 5 per cent per year. They’re four times more common in men than women. There are now more mouth and throat cancers caused by HPV in the U.S. each year than there are cervical cancers. Oral sex is the main risk factor for getting an HPV infection in the mouth or throat, Gillison said. While “oral sex does not give you cancer,” the infection in rare cases can develop into cancer over many years, she explained. THE STUDY She led the study, funded by the National Cancer Institute , while previously at Ohio State University. Researchers interviewed 2,627 men and women ages 18 to 33 years in a national health study from 2011 to 2014 about whether they had been vaccinated, and tested oral rinse samples from them for HPV. Infections with worrisome HPV strains were found in far fewer people who had received any shots – an 88 per cent lower risk. The results in men were striking – no infections in the vaccinated group versus 2.13 per cent of the others. The study was observational, so it can’t prove the vaccine was responsible. But it may no longer be ethical to do an experiment where one group gets no vaccine, because its benefits for preventing other cancers is known. It might be possible to do such a study in people over 26, the age limit now for HPV vaccination, Gillison said. If a benefit were shown, it might lead to expanding the group for whom the vaccine is recommended. The bottom line is that the vaccine helps, and “so few people who should be getting it are,” said Dr. Richard Schilsky, chief medical officer of the oncology society who had no role in the study. WHAT PATIENTS SAY Scott Courville wishes it existed when he was young. The 43-year-old construction inspector from St. Martinville, Louisiana, was treated last year for HPV-related tonsil cancer that spread to lymph nodes. “I went through 33 rounds of radiation and six rounds of chemotherapy,” lost 100 pounds, and now has damaged taste buds and sinuses, and constant ringing in his ears, he said. His three teenaged sons and stepsons are getting the vaccine. “There was no question at all” that they would, only how soon, he said. Tom Jackson also had an HPV-related tonsil cancer, found in 2013, and works to fight stigma over an infection that is largely sexually spread. As a school board trustee in Houston, “I believe strongly that all children should receive all vaccinations,” Jackson said. “The horror of HPV cancer is tremendous,” and not to be “whitewashed” by squeamishness or reluctance to discuss prevention, he said. THE VACCINES The vaccines are recommended mostly for young people, ideally before they’re exposed to HPV. Merck’s Gardasil is approved in the U.S. for females 9 through 26 to prevent cervical, vulvar, vaginal and anal cancers and genital warts. For males ages 9 through 26, it’s approved for preventing anal cancer and genital warts. A newer version of Gardasil that includes more HPV virus types is approved for males 9 through 15. GlaxoSmithKline’s Cervarix vaccine is approved for females 9 through 25 to prevent cervical cancer. All require two or three shots, depending on age. Other ways to help prevent oral HPV infections are limiting the number of sex partners and not smoking. Condoms or dental dams may help. Signs and symptoms of mouth and throat cancers may include a long-lasting sore throat, earaches, hoarseness, enlarged lymph nodes and pain when swallowing. ___ Marilynn Marchione can be followed on Twitter: @MMarchioneAP 000000 000000 Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

These cancers are rising fast, especially in men, and research suggests that HPV, the human papillomavirus, is spreading through oral sex. The actor Michael Douglas brought attention to this risk several years ago when he blamed his cancer on it. This is the first study of whether the vaccine might prevent oral HPV infections in young men, and the results suggest it can. No men who had received at least one dose were later found to have infections of HPV strains linked to cancer, but more than 2 percent of unvaccinated men had them. "There may be additional benefits to vaccinating your son or daughter" besides the problems the vaccine already is known to prevent, said Dr. Maura Gillison of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Results were released Wednesday by the American Society of Clinical Oncology ahead of presentation at its annual meeting next month. THE VIRUS HPV is very common — most sexually active people have been exposed to it. Some types cause genital warts. Usually, the virus causes no symptoms and goes away, but some people develop long-lasting infections of strains that can cause cancer. The vaccine was approved in 2006 to prevent cervical cancers in women, and later, for some others including anal cancer in men. But acceptance has been slow — only about half of those eligible are getting it now, according to the latest information. Now, awareness is growing of HPV's other risks — oral infections are blamed for 70 percent of cancers in the mouth and back of the throat. About 11,600 of these occur each year in the U.S. and rates are rising 5 percent per year. They're four times more common in men than women. There are now more mouth and throat cancers caused by HPV in the U.S. each year than there are cervical cancers. Oral sex is the main risk factor for getting an HPV infection in the mouth or throat, Gillison said. While "oral sex does not give you cancer," the infection in rare cases can develop into cancer over many years, she explained. THE STUDY She led the study, funded by the National Cancer Institute , while previously at Ohio State University. Researchers interviewed 2,627 men and women ages 18 to 33 years in a national health study from 2011 to 2014 about whether they had been vaccinated, and tested oral rinse samples from them for HPV. Infections with worrisome HPV strains were found in far fewer people who had received any shots — an 88 percent lower risk. The results in men were striking — no infections in the vaccinated group versus 2.13 percent of the others. The study was observational, so it can't prove the vaccine was responsible. But it may no longer be ethical to do an experiment where one group gets no vaccine, because its benefits for preventing other cancers is known. It might be possible to do such a study in people over 26, the age limit now for HPV vaccination, Gillison said. If a benefit were shown, it might lead to expanding the group for whom the vaccine is recommended. The bottom line is that the vaccine helps, and "so few people who should be getting it are," said Dr. Richard Schilsky, chief medical officer of the oncology society who had no role in the study. WHAT PATIENTS SAY Scott Courville wishes it existed when he was young. The 43-year-old construction inspector from St. Martinville, Louisiana, was treated last year for HPV-related tonsil cancer that spread to lymph nodes. "I went through 33 rounds of radiation and six rounds of chemotherapy," lost 100 pounds, and now has damaged taste buds and sinuses, and constant ringing in his ears, he said. His three teenaged sons and stepsons are getting the vaccine. "There was no question at all" that they would, only how soon, he said. Tom Jackson also had an HPV-related tonsil cancer, found in 2013, and works to fight stigma over an infection that is largely sexually spread. As a school board trustee in Houston, "I believe strongly that all children should receive all vaccinations," Jackson said. "The horror of HPV cancer is tremendous," and not to be "whitewashed" by squeamishness or reluctance to discuss prevention, he said. THE VACCINES The vaccines are recommended mostly for young people, ideally before they're exposed to HPV. Merck's Gardasil is approved in the U.S. for females 9 through 26 to prevent cervical, vulvar, vaginal and anal cancers and genital warts. For males ages 9 through 26, it's approved for preventing anal cancer and genital warts. A newer version of Gardasil that includes more HPV virus types is approved for males 9 through 15. GlaxoSmithKline's Cervarix vaccine is approved for females 9 through 25 to prevent cervical cancer. All require two or three shots, depending on age. Other ways to help prevent oral HPV infections are limiting the number of sex partners and not smoking. Condoms or dental dams may help. Signs and symptoms of mouth and throat cancers may include a long-lasting sore throat, earaches, hoarseness, enlarged lymph nodes and pain when swallowing. ___ Marilynn Marchione can be followed on Twitter: @MMarchioneAP Copyright 2017 by The Associated Press.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Consistent Rise in Geriatric Population is Expected to Stimulate Geriatric Complementary and Alternative Medicines Market Geriatric Complementary and Alternative Medicines (CAM) Market: Overview Geriatric population is more susceptible to chronic diseases such as heart problems, joint disorders and others. Therefore, this population group needs regular use of the medicines to prevent the disease conditions. The use of complementary and alternative medicines is increasing among the geriatric population globally due to the fact that CAMs decreases the risk of adverse reactions and drug interactions. Browse to unlock the hidden opportunities in Geriatric Complementary and Alternative Medicines (CAM) Market: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/geriatric-complementar… Complementary and alternative medicines include products such as dietary medicine and herbal medicine products. These medicines can be used for the management of both communicable (i.e. tuberculosis, hantavirus and others) and non communicable diseases (i.e. chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular and others) in geriatric population. These medicines (i.e. CAM) treat the patients by healing therapies which is not based on principles of conventional medicine. Geriatric Complementary and Alternative Medicines (CAM) Market: Growth Enablers Consistent rise in geriatric population is expected to stimulate the market growth of geriatric complementary and alternative medicines. For example, according to a report published by World Health Organization (WHO), the number of people aged 65 years or older is expected to increase from 605 million in 2012 to 2 billion by 2050. In addition, the use of complementary and alternative medicine is rapidly increasing among the geriatric population which would act as the potential driver for the market growth. For example, National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) and American Association of Retired People (AARP) conducted one survey which stated that the use of CAM is increasing globally among the population aged 50 years and above. The report published by the Journal of Pharmacy Practice and Research also suggests that geriatric population widely uses complementary and alternative medicines compared to general population. The survey revealed that around 80% of the geriatric population globally is using at least one complementary and alternative medicine. Additionally, increasing number of clinical studies to investigate the effectiveness and mechanism of action (MOA) of complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) drives the growth of the market. Moreover, factors such as low cost, effective therapy and others further stimulates the uptake of complementary and alternative medicines market in near future. However, lack of awareness for complementary and alternative medicines therapies among geriatric population restrains the market growth. Geriatric Complementary and Alternative Medicines (CAM) Market: Regional Dynamics Geographically, North America is considered as the largest market of geriatric complementary and alternative medicines owing to high use of CAMs in this region. For example, Health and Retirement Study conducted one survey which concluded that around 85% of the geriatric population in North America reported the use of complementary and alternative medicines. Thus, high use of CAM modalities will establish healthy platform to develop the growth of geriatric complementary and alternative medicines market. Europe is the second largest market of geriatric complementary and alternative medicines. The growth is mainly attributed to the increasing aging population coupled with rising use of complementary and alternative medicines in Europe. According to European Commission (Eurostat) report published in 2013, around 17.8% of the European population were aged 65 years and above. The organization has also stated that aging population is expected to increase at high rate in coming year in Europe. In addition, Asia-Pacific is the emerging market for geriatric complementary and alternative medicines market because of rising interest of key companies to expand their presence in Asia Pacific.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Global Diabetic Nephropathy Market is Envisaged to Result in its Impressive CAGR of More than 5.6% by 2020 According to a new market report published by Persistence Market Research “Global Market Study on Diabetic Nephropathy Market – Asia to Witness Highest Growth by 2020,”.The global diabetic nephropathy market was valued at USD 2,262.2 million in 2014 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.6% from 2014 to 2020, to reach an expected value of USD 3,145.9 million in 2020. Diabetic nephropathy is a disease of the kidney glomerulus and one of the most significant complications in terms of mortality and morbidity for patients with diabetes. Globally, the diabetic nephropathy market is witnessing significant growth due to increasing prevalence of diabetes and obesity in different regions of the world. In addition, increasing R&D investments in drug discovery and development and raising awareness about diabetes and kidney-related disorders are also driving the growth of the market. However, stringent regulatory requirements and longer approval time for drugs as well as the lack of comprehensive therapeutic management for diabetic nephropathy are inhibiting the growth of diabetic nephropathy market. The global diabetic nephropathy market is estimated at USD 2,262.2 million in 2014. It is likely to grow at a CAGR of 5.6% from 2014 to 2020 to reach USD 3,145.9 million in 2020.

For instance, the National Kidney Disease Education Program, one of the major programs organized by the U.S. government, for increasing awareness about the various kidney diseases. In addition, the number of diabetic patients are also increasing in the region; according to the SciELO Public Health, approximately 35 million people were affected with diabetes mellitus in 2000 and this number is expected to reach 64 million by 2025 in North America. In Europe, rise in healthcare expenditure for diabetes treatment and increasing prevalence of diabetes in the various part of Europe is boosting the growth of the European diabetic nephropathy market. According to IDF, approximately 55.4 million people had diabetes in 2010 and the number is expected to reach 66.5 million by 2030 in Europe. According to the IDF, healthcare expenditure for diabetes treatment was approximately USD 105.5 billion in 2010 and is expected to reach USD 124.6 billion by 2030 in Europe.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Rising Competition from Generics Compel Players to Aim at Comprehensive Pharmaceutical Product Lifecycle Management (LCM) Strategies Albany, NY — (SBWIRE) — 05/16/2017 — MarketResearchReports.biz has announced the addition of a report, titled „Pharmaceutical Lifecycle Management Strategies in 2017”, to its large depository. It provides a detailed analysis of product lifecycle (LCM) management strategies that are being implemented and are expected to come into force later this year by pharmaceutical companies worldwide. In recent times, the global pharmaceutical industry has witnessed rapidly changing healthcare landscape, stiff competition from generic and biosimilar manufacturers, and declining research and development productivity. To grow and stay relevant in this fast-changing marketplace, participants are looking at holistic approaches to improve processes that can escalate innovative product development while cutting down operational costs. View Report @ http://www.marketresearchreports.biz/analysis/1065938 One such holistic approach is to resort to pharmaceutical product lifecycle management strategies (LCM), which manage pharmaceutical products and related information across the enterprise. However, with the prevailing landscape, these strategies can no longer focus solely on the period between launch and patent expiry. The influx of generics is making the conventional LCM approach insufficient today. Determining apt LCM strategies is, therefore, imperative for manufacturers. To appeal more diverse and global customer base, players are focusing towards stepping up their game in creating, packaging, and quickly delivering consumer products. They are adopting LCM strategies that encompass the whole lifecycle of a pharmaceutical product from discovery through development and commercialization and on into post-market exclusivity. Through these strategies, they are also including planning for competition from generic forms in the initial stages of the development phase, instead of focusing on this area after the product is launched. Get Sample Copy Of this Report @ http://www.marketresearchreports.biz/sample/sample/1065938 In the process of following more comprehensive life cycle management model, several pharmaceutical companies have discovered that inputs from different verticals within the business must be considered. A cross-functional LCM model includes representatives from marketing, regulatory, research and development, process engineering, manufacturing, and other verticals across all therapeutic areas.
