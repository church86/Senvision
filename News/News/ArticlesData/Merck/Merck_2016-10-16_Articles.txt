The main driver of this achievement being its increase in competitiveness and steady progress in economic development,(1)” Dr. Frank Stangenberg-Haverkamp, Chairman of the Executive Board and the Family Board of E. Merck KG, said at the opening. “We are excited to open this office in Abidjan, which will be our first in Francophone Sub-Saharan Africa.”  The office was inaugurated by his Excellency, the Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany to Côte d'Ivoire, Dr. Claus Auer and key representatives of the Ivorian government along with Dr. Stangenberg-Haverkamp and Dr. Karim Bendhaou, President of North & West Africa. “This new office will allow us to reinforce and to develop our already existing activities in the country and it will be the hub for French speaking countries in Central and West Africa. We will continue to bring specialist and high-quality products to serve patients and help them to improve their quality of life,” added Dr. Bendhaou. Merck also donated two minilabs with the aim of supporting Côte d’Ivoire in its fight against counterfeit medicines. The minilabs, which help to detect counterfeits, are manufactured by the Global Pharma Health Fund (GPHF), a charitable initiative financed by Merck. “We are pleased that our plan to establish a public-private partnership to combat counterfeits will be translated into effective measures with the donated minilabs, in addition to an awareness campaign led by the Minister of Health and Public Hygiene,” Bendhaou said. The donation ceremony was graced by The First Lady of Côte d’Ivoire, Dominique Claudine Ouattara and H.E. Minister of Health and Public Hygiene, Dr. Raymonde Goudou Coffie. These minilabs will be the first to be used in Côte d’Ivoire. “This donation done by Merck will allow us to reinforce our structures for drug monitoring. The people will be reassured that they are investing in medicines which are safe, not dangerous and suitable for consumption,” H.E. Minister of Health and Public Hygiene expressed her gratitude for this donation. “The mobile compact laboratories are globally renowned for their ability to detect counterfeits quickly, cost-efficiently and reliably.  The Ministry of Health and Public Hygiene makes quality control its top priority.” Merck’s fight against counterfeit medicines is part of the company’s health-related corporate responsibility initiatives. Many people in low- to middle-income countries lack access to high-quality health solutions and Merck is leveraging its expertise and collaborating with strong partners to develop innovative solutions for such patients.

Approval for Dynavax's hepatitis B vaccine could be in jeopardy. Does the biotech have a backup plan ready? Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) Oct 16, 2016 at 11:43AM Image source: Getty Images. Here's how small-cap biotech Dynavax Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:DVAX) would like its story to play out: Hepatitis B vaccine Heplisav-B wins FDA approval in December. The company begins marketing the vaccine in 2017. Heplisav-B then goes on to quickly exceed sales projections. Dynavax's stock soars. That's plan A. But does Dynavax need a plan B? And if so, what is it? Is Heplisav-B in trouble? The Food and Drug Administration was originally scheduled to make a decision on Heplisav-B by Sept. 15. In April, however, that date was pushed back to Dec. 15. The FDA said it needed more time to complete its review of the Biologics License Application (BLA) for the vaccine. An FDA advisory committee was scheduled to review the BLA for Heplisav-B on Nov. 16. But that meeting won't happen. The FDA notified Dynavax in September that the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee meeting was canceled. Instead, the agency said that any "remaining questions will be addressed between Dynavax and the review team." These types of advisory meeting cancellations usually aren't a good sign. Dynavax shares have dropped 24% since the news broke. The market certainly appears to think that Heplisav-B could be in trouble. That might not be the case, of course. But if Heplisav-B fails to win approval, what's next for Dynavax? Plan B It was only three years ago that Dynavax thought it was on track for imminent success with Heplisav-B. The company had the rug pulled out from under its feet, though, when the FDA rejected the vaccine over safety concerns. Dynavax's plan B back then was to regroup and conduct more clinical studies of Heplisav-B. I imagine the company will take the same approach if the FDA doesn't approve the vaccine later this year. Of course, this all depends on the details behind any potential negative decision. Another backup strategy would be for Dynavax to shift its focus to cancer drug SD-101. Merck (NYSE:MRK) liked the potential for SD-101 enough that it forged an agreement with Dynavax in 2015 to collaborate on clinical studies.  Early results from one of those studies were announced on Oct. 9. Patients with advanced melanoma were given SD-101 in combination with Merck's Keytruda. While the initial results were encouraging, only five patients were evaluated for efficacy of the regimen, with 16 patients evaluated for safety. Merck also plans to test SD-101 with its anti-interleukin-10 cancer drug, MK-1966. Enrollment is under way for a phase 1 clinical study. At this point, though, any potential for MK-1966 combined with SD-101 is so far out that Merck doesn't even include the study in its "official" pipeline.  Dynavax's pipeline does include a couple of candidates other than Heplisav-B and SD-101. The biotech partnered with AstraZeneca to develop experimental asthma drug AZD1419. There's also DV1179, a toll-like receptor (TLR) inhibitor that targets autoimmune diseases. Both drugs are in early-stage clinical studies. Planning ahead I suspect that Dynavax's management team is bracing themselves in case they have to resort to a plan B. At least they had practice with the setback for Heplisav-B a few years ago. What could investors who have already bought Dynavax stock do in the midst of all the uncertainty? Shareholders could simply hold on and hope for the best. Another alternative is to hedge by buying put options (although the volatility makes options expensive). And, of course, there's always the choice of selling now.  The good news is that Dynavax -- and its shareholders -- have a plan B to fall back on. The bad news is that plan B is almost always worse than plan A. Keith Speights has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

AgWired Animal Ag Precision Energy AgNewsWire ZimmComm Navigation Subscribe Advertise About Subscribe Advertise About Merck Receives USDA License for BOVILIS CORONAVIRUS Merck Receives USDA License for BOVILIS CORONAVIRUS Jamie Johansen October 17, 2016 Leave a Comment Facebook Twitter Email Print The 2016 World Dairy Expo was the perfect venue for Merck Animal Health to debut their BOVILIS® CORONAVIRUS, the 1st USDA-approved modified-live intranasal vaccine to aid in reduction of enteric disease caused by Bovine Coronavirus (BCV). BCV is commonly transferred by animals during periods of stress, including shipping, parturition, cold weather, commingling or delivery to a backgrounding facility or feedyard. Scours and winter dysentery are often the two signs that will signal the presence of BCV. A 2012 study at the University of Wisconsin Diagnostic Laboratory tested 147 herds and found nearly half (49.4 percent) of the herds to be positive for BCV. In related research at Oklahoma State University, 37 percent of BCV cases are found in calves zero to 30-days old. Scott Nordstrom, D.V.M., Merck Animal Health, was on hand during the Expo to share more about the new vaccine. “Bovine coronavirus is far more prevalent than producers realize and, thus, the need to vaccinate is vitally important. When used as part of a complete vaccination protocol, BOVILIS CORONAVIRUS delivers protection against the enteric signs of bovine coronavirus and is a critical component in improving the overall health of cattle on an operation.” Dr. Nordstrom said BOVILIS CORONAVIRUS the intranasal vaccine can be given from birth on. As a modified-live vaccine, it creates it’s own active immunity. “It can be given prior to when we see the disease in calves. Which is usually between zero and fours weeks of age.” In the past the only way to protect calves was to vaccinate the dams, but now Dr. Nordstrom said, “We are not only able to vaccinate the dams to provided colostrum with antibodies for it, but we can immunize the calves by giving them this product.” Listen to my complete interview with Dr. Nordstrom to learn about diagnostic signs and the importance of working with your local veterinarian.

Approval for Dynavax's hepatitis B vaccine could be in jeopardy. Does the biotech have a backup plan ready? Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) Oct 16, 2016 at 11:43AM Image source: Getty Images. Here's how small-cap biotech Dynavax Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:DVAX) would like its story to play out: Hepatitis B vaccine Heplisav-B wins FDA approval in December. The company begins marketing the vaccine in 2017. Heplisav-B then goes on to quickly exceed sales projections. Dynavax's stock soars. That's plan A. But does Dynavax need a plan B? And if so, what is it? Is Heplisav-B in trouble? The Food and Drug Administration was originally scheduled to make a decision on Heplisav-B by Sept. 15. In April, however, that date was pushed back to Dec. 15. The FDA said it needed more time to complete its review of the Biologics License Application (BLA) for the vaccine. An FDA advisory committee was scheduled to review the BLA for Heplisav-B on Nov. 16. But that meeting won't happen. The FDA notified Dynavax in September that the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee meeting was canceled. Instead, the agency said that any "remaining questions will be addressed between Dynavax and the review team." These types of advisory meeting cancellations usually aren't a good sign. Dynavax shares have dropped 24% since the news broke. The market certainly appears to think that Heplisav-B could be in trouble. That might not be the case, of course. But if Heplisav-B fails to win approval, what's next for Dynavax? Plan B It was only three years ago that Dynavax thought it was on track for imminent success with Heplisav-B. The company had the rug pulled out from under its feet, though, when the FDA rejected the vaccine over safety concerns. Dynavax's plan B back then was to regroup and conduct more clinical studies of Heplisav-B. I imagine the company will take the same approach if the FDA doesn't approve the vaccine later this year. Of course, this all depends on the details behind any potential negative decision. Another backup strategy would be for Dynavax to shift its focus to cancer drug SD-101. Merck (NYSE:MRK) liked the potential for SD-101 enough that it forged an agreement with Dynavax in 2015 to collaborate on clinical studies.  Early results from one of those studies were announced on Oct. 9.

Source: A 4 via Flickr BMY stock’s latest issue arrived when rival Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) released positive clinical trial results for a type of lung cancer treatment. Shares of BMY were crushed because it is developing a similar drug for the same type of cancer and the first to market will be the major winner. With the news hitting the market this past weekend, MRK officially has the lead and this hurts BMY’s prospects. 9 Best Stocks to Buy Amid Market Turmoil Click to Enlarge In fact, it sent BMY stock down 10% to its lowest level since 2014. The chart is in clear breakdown mode after its second major plunge in the past three months. BMY first collapsed on Aug. 5, falling 16% after poor results for a cancer drug. The negative news kicked off a freefall from which the stock has yet to recover. There’s another factor hurting BMY, too: Now that Hillary Clinton has taken a commanding lead in the polls, her rhetoric of being harsh on drug pricing has put a black cloud over the entire sector. The iShares Dow Jones US Pharm Indx (ETF) (NYSEARCA:IHE), which tracks the Dow Jones Pharmaceutical Index, closed at a fresh three-month low Wednesday. At this point, buying into BMY stock would be trying to catch a falling knife. The only logical plan is to wait for the sector to bottom out, then see how BMY is reacting. If it’s also building a base, that could be the opportunity to get in at a low price. Personally, I’d buy in a little higher rather than trying to pick a bottom. Disney Princesses Give Hasbro the Magic Touch There is still great long-term value in BMY stock given its solid cancer drug pipeline, but shares can become oversold for months before the true fundamentals are reflected in the stock price.

Mello learned 10 years ago he would share the Nobel Prize in medicine for uncovering a way to silence genes, the researcher stood before his colleagues at the University of Massachusetts Medical School and offered what might as well have been a challenge. “My deepest hope is that this will lead to therapeutics that will help people,” he said. Finally, after a decade of hype, dashed hopes and perseverance, researchers are getting closer to realizing that hope. A handful of companies, mostly in the United States, are plunging forward with experimental products using RNAi, or RNA interference, to tackle everything from surgical scars to diseases that originate in the liver. Many more scientists are studying whether RNAi might treat the virus that causes AIDS and other dangerous disorders. “It was a fascinating ride, absolutely fabulous ride,” said Anastasia Khvorova, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, who is researching ways to carry gene-blocking molecules known as oligonucleotides, including RNAi, into tissues other than the liver. “I am, for sure, conflicted, because I have been developing drugs out of oligonucleotides for the last 20 years. At this point, it’s kind of personal to get it to work. I think at this point, RNAi is coming of age.” RNA is a naturally occurring molecule that plays a critical role in life. RNA copies and conveys genetic information from DNA, the genetic blueprints to life that are nestled inside cells. Short strands of RNA can also shut down individual genes. In 1998, Mr. Mello and collaborator Andrew Fire, now of Stanford University, demonstrated RNAi in tiny laboratory worms. Three years later, researchers in Germany reported they had used RNAi to silence genes in the cells of mammals. Science, the influential journal, named small RNAs the scientific breakthrough of the year in 2002. Biotechnology investors and entrepreneurs took note, jumping in with millions of dollars to start companies and lock down patents in the emerging field. In 2006, the same year Mr. Mello and Mr. Fire won the Nobel Prize in medicine, the drugmaker Merck & Co. paid $1.1 billion to acquire Sirna Therapeutics, an RNAi company. A year later, Roche Holding AG, another big pharma company, paid $330 million to license RNAi therapies from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Cambridge. Yet the early enthusiasm soon waned, as researchers scrambled to find ways to get RNAi molecules into the body – and to the correct location – without degrading, setting off immune reactions, or being swept away by normal cellular processes. Some groups tried injecting RNAi molecules directly into targeted tissues, while others looked to stabilize RNAi molecules and wrap them in “delivery vehicles” that could navigate through the body’s bloodstream to hone in on targeted cells, according to Pamela A. Pavco, chief development officer of RXi Pharmaceutical Corp. of Marlboro. RXi is going the first route, developing RNAi molecules that can be injected into skin or the eyes to treat scarring or vision disorders. As with any new technology, the initial reaction to RNAi was, “Wow, this is the coolest thing,” she said. “Then there were year and years of trying to figure out how to work with it.” There was also what independent RNAi expert Dirk Haussecker called a “general backlash” between 2008 and 2011. Merck, just a few years after its investment in Sirna, pared back its RNAi spending and then, in 2014, sold it to Alnylam. Roche’s assets ended up in the hands of Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Pasadena. Scientists kept working, however, and found ways to deliver RNAi into cells by encasing them in lipid nanoparticles and linking them with sugars. Early studies showed that RNAi molecules ended up in the liver, so some companies focused on diseases that involve the liver. That’s the case with Alnylam, which now has products in human studies for eight different conditions. The company’s lead product is patisiran, now in the third and final phase of testing as a treatment for hereditary ATTR amyloidosis, a disease in which proteins made in the liver accumulate in nerve cells. If the drug succeeds, it could hit the market in 2018. “It turns out that the liver is a treasure trove of genetically valid targets that are implicated in a number of diseases,” said Alnylam president Barry Greene. “Our diseases aren’t liver diseases. They are diseases, however, where the protein that we’re targeting is synthesized in the liver. By doing so, we can have an impact on the disease.” More than a dozen RNAi therapeutics are now in clinical trials for ailments such as hepatitis B, and some big investors such as Roche have even returned to the field with new deals. Some estimates put the market for RNAi therapeutics at more than $4 billion by 2022. Still, some setbacks continue. Alnylam recently reported it was discontinuing work on its drug revusiran, which was in the final phase of human testing, amid reports of patients experiencing the nerve condition known as peripheral neuropathy. Researchers said they don’t expect setbacks to thwart the field of RNAi, and they compare its arc to that of monoclonal antibodies, another biomedical technology that took years to come to market but is now producing important therapies. “I spent my career working on this because I really believe something is going to come out some day,” said Ms. Pavco, of RXi. “I think a lot of the hurdles have been worked out. We’re getting closer to that every day.” Contact Lisa Eckelbecker at lisa.eckelbecker@telegram.com. Follow her on Twitter @LisaEckelbecker.

The S&P/TSX Composite inched up 3.88 points to greet noon at 14,588.87. The Canadian dollar gained 0.03 cents to 76.13 cents U.S. The Chief Executive of Rogers, Guy Laurence, is stepping down effective immediately and will be replaced by former Telus Corp executive Joe Natale as soon as possible, the Canadian telecom company said. The surprise move came as Rogers also posted a sharp fall in net income after it shut down the streaming television joint venture Shomi. Its shares rose 1.4% to $55.11. The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, added strength as Teck Resources rose 4% to $25.65, while Barrick Gold was up 0.8% at $20.77. Among industrials, Canadian National Railway fell 0.4% to $86.83, while health-care giant Valeant Pharmaceutical International was down 1.9% at $28.58. On the economic slate, Statistics Canada reported foreign investment in Canadian securities totaled $12.7 billion in August, led by acquisitions of Canadian bonds on the secondary market. At the same time, the agency says, Canadian investment in foreign securities slowed to $1.6 billion. This resulted in a net inflow of funds of $11.1 billion into the Canadian economy in the month ON BAY STREET The TSX Venture Exchange was positive 0.39 points to 773.41 The 12 TSX subgroups were evenly split between gainers and losers, as gold moved upwards 1.2%, materials took on 0.8%, and utilities strengthened 0.5%. The half-dozen laggards were weighed most by consumer discretionary stocks, down 0.5%, while energy and health-care surrendered 0.4% each. ON WALL STREET U.S. stocks held slightly lower on Monday as investors digested a number of corporate results and key economic data while keeping an eye on the Federal Reserve. The Dow Jones Industrials staggered 35.95 points to 18,102.43, with Merck leading decliners and IBM the top advancer. The S&P 500 slid 3.33 points to 2,129.65, with energy leading five sectors lower and utilities leading risers. The NASDAQ composite index dropped 2.96 points to 5,211.20, as shares of Apple dropped 0.4%. Banking giant Bank of America and toymaker Hasbro were among the firms reporting quarterly earnings before the bell. Both firms beat Wall Street estimates. IBM and Netflix are among the companies scheduled to release results after the close on Monday. Earnings season has gotten off to a good start. Experts say that, of the 34 S&P 500 companies that had reported as of Friday morning, 79% had beaten Wall Street estimates for earnings per share. Last week, banking giants JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo all reported better-than-expected profits and sales. Investors also digested industrial production data, which showed a 0.1% increase in September, slightly below a consensus estimate of 0.2%. Meanwhile, the New York Fed's Empire State business conditions showed manufacturing in the state contracted for the third straight month. Overseas, Chinese gross domestic product, retail sales and industrial profits are all scheduled for release on Wednesday. Last week, U.S. stocks were weighed down by a surprise fall in Chinese exports. Prices for the 10-year Treasury gained, lowering yields to 1.78% from Friday’s 1.8%. Treasury prices and yields move in opposite directions. Oil prices were down 88 cents at $49.47 U.S. a barrel Gold prices nosed higher 40 cents to $1,255.90 U.S. an ounce.

It will include policy recommendations from the Moonshot Task Force for a range of government agencies — possibly for funding for the genome sequencing of tumors — and Biden’s vision for how to achieve 10 years of advancements against cancer in half that time. Story Continued Below This is likely the Obama administration’s last big White House event on the issue. It follows a blue ribbon report last month that laid out the greatest scientific opportunities in cancer research. But whether the Moonshot lifts off or fails to launch depends largely on whether Congress funds it in the upcoming lame-duck session. Appropriators have shown they’re willing to boost NIH’s fortunes based on bills passed in committee earlier this year, but cancer research advocates will be pushing for extra short-term funding in the 21st Century Cures legislation. The “Cures bill is something we are going to be strongly advocating for in the lame duck because it’s the perfect vehicle for the moonshot,” said Jon Retzlaff, managing director of science policy and government relations at the American Association for Cancer Research. “[It] could really change the face of cancer.” Happy Monday and welcome to Prescription PULSE, where we note that this month in 1979, Allan Cormack and Godfrey Hounsfield won the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine for their work developing computer-assisted tomography — the revolutionary new 3-D imaging technology. FDA TO COLLECT $2.5 BILLION IN USER FEES IN GDUFA II — That’s nearly $1 billion more than the agency agreed to collect in the first iteration of the Generic Drug User Fee Act, which was signed into law in 2012. Generic drug companies and FDA agreed that user fees should total $493.6 million annually in GDUFA II, which Congress is expected to reauthorize in late 2017. It would run through FY 2022. In GDUFA I they agreed to $299 million a year, but that was based on FDA receiving about 750 generic drug applications each year. Instead, the agency has received about 1,000 applications annually, so the agency needs additional funds to meet its productivity goals. The GDUFA II fee structure is also being revised so that FDA receives a smaller percentage of its user fees from new generic drug applications. To offset this change, companies that sponsor one or more approved generic drugs will pay an annual fee. The agency is also eliminating fees for supplements to already approved applications and altering how it determines fees for small companies. The full text of the commitments FDA agreed to in return for the financial support was also released late last week. Some highlights: FDA is committing to review 90 percent of generic applications within 10 months of submission. It will review priority applications within eight months if a company submits certain manufacturing information two months ahead of filing its application. UDI TO FLY — The obscure ASC-X12 standards committee will likely recommend that unique device identification numbers for medical devices be included on payment claims forms, Pro eHealth’s Darius Tahir reports. Even as the device industry’s trade groups have publicly turned against the idea, objections from stakeholders, including the American Hospital Association and even CMS, have gradually been worn down by safety hawks and data wonks campaigning to do for medical devices what the barcode did for retail products. … UDI would allow tracking of individual devices as they move through the system, enabling easier recalls and informing comparative effectiveness research. AdvaMed worries that information on the claims forms will lead to research that misconstrues the data, and instead recommends putting the UDI on electronic health records. But members of the standards committee said the concerns would be overcome. “Right now I am optimistic that there will be a field for the device identifier on the claim,” Joseph Drozda, Mercy Hospital cardiologist and X-12 workgroup member, told Darius. “There’s a groundswell to support that.” TOP DEMS PRESSURED FDA, DRUG COMPANY TO HELP DYING BIG DONOR — Former President Bill Clinton, then-Sen. John Kerry and other top Democrats pressured FDA and a pharmaceutical company to get a top donor access to an experimental cancer medicine, according to hacked emails released by Wikileaks Saturday. In 2008, Clinton and Kerry, along with former Sens. Max Baucus and Tom Harkin, worked Washington lobbyists, board members and shareholders for the drug company Biogen, helping to arrange conversations between then-FDA Commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach and company CEO James Mullen. They were working to get Dallas fundraiser Fred Baron access to Biogen’s Tysabri to treat his bone marrow cancer. The effort appeared to help persuade FDA to provide assurances to the drug company that FDA would turn a blind eye to any negative effects experienced by Baron when evaluating the drug, but Biogen continued to say no. Doctors are legally allowed to use FDA approved treatments "off label" for conditions not approved by FDA. However, Tysabri’s distribution was very tightly controlled and monitored because it increases patients risk of a deadly brain infection. Ultimately it was Nancy Pelosi — who worked with FDA and the Mayo Clinic to get the drug administered without the company’s consent, according to the Dallas Morning News. But it did not save Baron’s life. The disclosure comes amid a nationwide push for “Right-to-Try” laws that allow terminally ill patients to skirt FDA’s compassionate use process when requesting access to experimental medicines. More than half the states have passed such laws with huge bipartisan support, but backers haven't been able to get a national version though the Senate. Former FDA attorney Patti Zettler said that the Wikileaks emails actually support the position that "FDA generally works with terminally and seriously ill patients who are seeking expanded access." That, she added, suggests that the right to try laws are a "misplaced policy effort to the extent they draw attention and resources away from efforts to develop effective treatments for terminally and seriously ill patients, sow confusion about the FDA’s role and processes or create false hope.” And despite the emails' claim that Biogen hesitated in Baron's case over fears it could compromise the drug's approval for cancer, Zettler added that FDA has recently published a study showing it is extremely rare for adverse events from expanded access to have a negative impact on drug development. MED DEVICE INDUSTRY CHAMPION IN TOUGH REELECTION FIGHT — Rep. Erik Paulsen last year helped win a two-year moratorium on Obamacare's medical device tax, but the Minnesota Republican is facing his toughest reelection contest. Paulsen represents exactly the type of wealthy, suburban swing district where Donald Trump's incendiary rhetoric may prove toxic down ballot. He’s won his last three reelection contests by more than 15 points, but polls show his district is distinctly anti-Trump. More from Pro’s Paul Demko here. PHARMA IN THE STATES A PEEK BEHIND THE DRUG REBATE CURTAIN DOESN’T MAKE THE PICTURE ANY PRETTIER — Drug spending in Massachusetts grew significantly from 2013 to 2015, the state’s Office of the Attorney General reported last week, even when accounting for discounts and rebates paid by drug companies. The findings debunk claims that rebates — often kept secret — mitigate the trend of increased drug spending when only the list price is taken into account. The AG studied spending by 10 different plans accounting for about 75 percent of Massachusetts’ commercial market and found that in most cases rebates didn’t substantially alter the increase in spending. In one case, a health plan actually experienced a greater increase in drug spend post-rebates. … Competition fail. The AG also conducted a case study of multiple sclerosis drugs to understand why prices have increased even as new drugs have entered the market. There are 14 FDA approved products). The report found net prices, not just list prices, have been steadily increasing since 2011. It also found that most commercial plans in the state pay very similar prices for the treatments despite different negotiation approaches with drug companies, varying plan size and market share, and differences in formulary design. “Our findings suggest we cannot count on competition … to discipline prices” because the demand for treatments for some diseases is great enough that “payers cannot meaningfully negotiate on formulary placement or the rebates that lower net prices.” Another problem, they said, is the lack of data on comparative effectiveness. Most MS drugs haven’t been tested in head-to-head clinical trials, making it difficult to assess whether one is more valuable than another. … Generic competition suffers too. Of the 10 MS drugs they zeroed in on, the only drug with a generic alternative in the group, Copaxone 20 mg, appears to have become victim to “product hopping” — a tactic used by brand drug makers to squash generic competition. A year before the generic drug came on the market, Teva introduced an injectable version that patients take less often. By the time the generic Copaxone 20 mg pill was available, 70 percent of patients had changed to the newer branded version, which doesn’t have an automatically substitutable generic. ** A message from The Biologics Prescribers Collaborative (BPC): Meaningful suffixes are important in medicine.

One of the judges went as far as to describe Burzynski as “‘a dedicated and innovative physician’ whose treatments have saved the lives of cancer patients, both adults and children,’” the Houston Chronicle reports. The state’s case against Burzynski focused on seven patients who said they were lured by false advertising about his controversial and unproven chemotherapy and received substandard care. It’s the latest victory for Burzynski who’s been targeted by FDA and the Texas State Medical Board. Terminal patients travel all over the world to see the doctor, although his medications have never been proven effective in clinical trials. CALIFORNIA FIGHT OVER PROP 61 HEATS UP — Sen. Bernie Sanders headlined a rally Friday for the ballot measure that would cap what state programs pays for prescription drugs at the rates negotiated by the Veteran’s Administration. The provision has enjoyed broad approval in recent polls, but six more California papers weighed in last week against the measure, joining a recent wave of editorials warning that it’s not the answer to high drug prices. MERCK, AETNA SET UP DIABETES PAY-FOR-PERFORMANCE PROGRAM — The drug giant and health insurer announced the latest agreement that aims to tie drug reimbursement to how well products work in the real world. Merck will provide Aetna with rebates on two of its type 2 diabetes drugs, Januvia (sitagliptin) and Janumet (sitagliptin plus metformin). Rebates will be based, in part, on whether Aetna’s members achieve or maintain their treatment objectives while taking the medications. Merck will also work with Aetna on its AetnaCare initiative. The program works with patients, physicians and caregivers to encourage treatment adherence, reinforce healthy behaviors and provide additional support, such as nutrition assistance. These types of reimbursement deals have been touted as one of the promising non-government solutions to high drug prices, but industry experts say it will probably be a year or two before we’ll learn if any of these programs live up to their promise. QUICK HITS Staving off an IPR challenge. Biopharmaceutical firm, Shire, proved victorious over hedge fund manager Kyle Bass this month, staving off an IPR challenge — a method of contesting a company’s intellectual property more quickly than through the court system. The Patent and Trademark Office upheld the validity of one of the company’s patents, which is related to the ulcerative colitis drug, Lialda. Free charity? Forbes reports Doctors Without Borders rejected $1 million worth of free pneumonia vaccines from pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, arguing that there is no such thing as “free” vaccines. The organization’s executive director, Jason Cone, writes in a Medium blog post that such acts of charity often come with conditions restricting where the vaccines can be administered and who can receive them. Pfizer strongly disagreed. Secret compassion. Only about one in five drug and biotech companies post on their websites their “compassionate use” policies, which allow for the use of investigational medical products outside of clinical trials. That’s according to a recent review by Avalere. Fighting superbugs. As the FDA ramps up the fight to control deadly superbugs by limiting antibiotic use in American livestock, the pharmaceutical industry — while complying with policy — is marketing the same drugs to veterinarians and expanding sales overseas to offset any decline in U.S. sales.

A federal judge in Massachusetts dismissed the cases against two employees of the New England Compounding Center whose handling of contaminated steroids led to a nationwide outbreak of fungal meningitis, the FDA Law Blog reports. Other NECC cases are ongoing, but the judge concluded that these two employees, who were responsible for checking outgoing drug packages for accuracy, were not pharmacists dispensing prescriptions under the law, and therefore, had no intent to defraud or mislead. Making pigs safe again. The FDA is working to bolster the regulation of heparin in China to prevent another tragedy like the one that took place in 2007-08. More than 80 deaths in the U.S. resulted from an adulterated version. But heparin's complex mixture of molecules makes it difficult for regulators to determine its authenticity. One Chinese company, Enoray, however, is up for the challenge of guaranteeing the integrity of its heparin supply chain. More from C & EN. Weapon for sale. An Associated Press investigation found 12 Chinese companies will export a powerful synthetic opioid known as carfentanil to the United States and other countries, for as little as $2,750 a kilogram, no questions asked. It’s a powerful chemical that has been killing unsuspecting drug users and is so lethal that it presents a potential terrorism threat. Officials say the drug, which is manufactured legally and openly sold online in China, is comparable to traditional nerve agents, raising concerns that they can be used as chemical weapons. THE COST OF VACCINE PREVENTABLE DISEASE — Researchers estimate that adults in the U.S. who didn’t receive 10 recommended vaccines were responsible for about $7.1 billion in avoidable costs from doctors visits, hospitalizations and lost productivity. One example from the new Health Affairs paper: Just 42 percent of adults received the flu vaccine in the last flu season; influenza accounted for $5.79 billion in medical costs. More here. GENERIC DRUG MAKERS ACCUSED OF COLLUDING ON PRICE HIKES — Perrigo Company, Fougera Pharmaceuticals, Sandoz and Taro Pharmaceutical Industries are all accused of conspiring to raise and fix the price of the generic skin treatment, Desonide, in a class-action lawsuit filed last week by an employee health fund in the Southern District of New York. Shortly after two meetings attended by each of the companies in July 2013, the drug makers acted in concert to raise the price of generic Desonide, with some versions rising by as much as 800 percent. CATCHING OUR ATTENTION: GENERATION ADDERALL — Adderall, the drug prescribed to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder, has become ubiquitous on college campuses, with sales exploding among adults to the tune of roughly 16 million prescriptions in 2013.

(Stephen Mally/The Gazette) Vanessa Miller The Gazette More stories from Vanessa Oct 14, 2016 at 9:40 pm | Print View Nearly four months after retiring from Iowa State University, the institution’s longtime Senior Vice President Warren Madden still is on the job — sort of. He’s volunteering. The 77-year-old emeritus vice president who spent 50 years at Iowa State before retiring June 30 is working out of the ISU Research Park on several university projects, including real estate and land deals agreements with the City of Ames, and tenants in the 220-acre Research Park. Madden, who’s not the only top university administrator in Iowa to continue working after retirement, told The Gazette he’s not been involved with ISU Flight Service or a $4.4 million deal with the City of Ames to improve its airport — both of which he was involved with before retirement and both of which have come under public scrutiny of late. He said his volunteer work rather has focused on ISU land deals, reviewing and extending several park leases with the city, and implementing the Research Park master plan, including expanding its footprint and working with tenants who want to expand facilities there. “I know the individuals and have the historical background that is helpful,” Madden said. “There are a number of central Iowa business and ISU alumni that serve and volunteer time and their expertise, and I am now one of them.” “For me,” he said, “this is also a good transition.” Despite his retirement and assertion he’s no longer involved in the university’s flight service, Madden recently has been looped into publicity around Iowa State’s airport deal with Ames and ISU President Steven Leath’s use of university aircraft. Madden, while employed at Iowa State, oversaw its flight service operation, and a recent Associated Press report indicated he said policy bars personal use of university planes — a comment that came as ISU revealed Leath on four occasions flew ISU aircraft for trips involving university and personal business. The AP article also quoted Madden as saying the school would never let Leath “fly by himself one of our planes because of insurance and liability issues.” The report prompted Madden to pen a letter in the Iowa State Daily refuting the report. “To suggest that I believe that the travel described in the various news articles violated policy or state law is simply wrong,” Madden wrote. “I have no such belief. In fact, my understanding is directly opposite to this conclusion.” He added about reports that Leath wouldn’t be allowed to fly ISU planes by himself, “This is also not true.” Madden reiterated for The Gazette — despite his history with ISU Flight Service, past work on the airport upgrades, and comments about the recent controversy — he’s not been involved with those issues since retiring. “I have not been involved in the airport development work since June 30,” Madden said. “I’m out of the airport business.” Several projects Madden has been working on are due to go before the Board of Regents for approval next week, although ISU spokesman John McCarroll said Madden is not planning to present to the board. One such project involves an ISU request to lease a 31,280-square-foot warehouse to the Research Park for product manufacturing for one of its tenants — Merck and Company, Inc. “The university’s long range goal is to build a relationship with Merck, encouraging future growth and expansion, ultimately leading to the construction of a new dedicated facility at the Research Park for product manufacturing and research and development,” according to board documents. Even though Madden is no longer on the Iowa State payroll, he continues to use a university email account. He also remains on the Research Park board and has agreed to continue on the CyRide board, “as they complete a major route review this year.” Madden said he expects his work with Iowa State will transition into a more traditional alumni role — “being athletic fans and personal donors and volunteers with units like Reiman Gardens, University Museums, and the concert series.” “My past administrative responsibilities in these areas are personal interests, and we have shifted to being donors and volunteers,” he said. Madden pointed out he’s not the only former administrator to stick around and help out. Former university presidents have volunteered in different capacities over the years, and Madden said his predecessor, Wayne Moore, transitioned out in a similar way. So did Carl Hamilton, who served as ISU vice president for information and development from 1967 to 1984. At the University of Iowa, former hospitals director John Colloton was one emeritus administrator whose work beyond retirement drew attention. He served as director from 1958 to 2000, but The Gazette in 2007 reported he had a UI office, phone number, email account, and secretary who was paid $58,447. The university at that time refused to release his emails and correspondence because, officials said, he “no longer conducts university business.” More recently, former longtime Senior Vice President and Treasurer Doug True officially retired in January 2015 but continued working part-time in three areas for about a year after. He assisted with the university’s treasury function, its flood recovery, and its acquisition of the AIB College of Business campus in Des Moines. And, True told The Gazette, he got paid for that part-time work. But he hasn’t been on the payroll since the start of this year — although he does make himself available for consult with those who have taken over the work he did. “These are my friends,” True said, adding that if they need help understanding a decision he made in 1998, for example, “it’s always delightful, if I can remember, to help people have some context.” John Barnshaw, director of research and public policy for the American Association of University Professors, said university administrators willing to continue working on a volunteer basis after retirement can add value in a variety of capacities — including in their institutional knowledge, deep business relationships, alumni networking, and donor connections. His only concerns relate to transparency and potential conflicts of interest. He said past administrators conducting university business should do so with a university email account, and they should continue to avoid potential conflicts with any personal business. “But if you’re above board, and your transparent in what you’re doing, and it has the buy-in of the administration as well as the faculty … it could add value,” Barnshaw said.

The Asia-Pacific gastric cancer market is forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 11.4% from $1.3 billion in 2015 to $2.7 billion in 2022. The current marketed products landscape comprises a wide range of treatment options, including HER2-targeted therapy, angiogenesis inhibitors and new chemotherapies. Nevertheless, significant unmet need remains for products that can treat HER2-negative gastric cancer patients. However, the gastric cancer market is undergoing a gradual change from a focus on generic chemotherapy regimens to a complex treatment landscape based on targeted therapies. In the current market, patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer can be treated with targeted therapies, such as Herceptin, while HER2-negative patients still receive chemotherapy regimens as the first-line treatment. The market will be driven by recently launched products and upcoming targeted therapies during the forecast period. The main restraints will be the low penetration of new targeted therapies, owing to their high price, and constrained healthcare budgets.
