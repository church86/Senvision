That's how much value investors wiped off the pharma firm on Friday morning after its trial to greatly broaden the use of one of its most promising cancer drugs failed. It was an unnecessarily risky move for Bristol, whose immunotherapy has been outselling Merck's. The stumble will allow its more cautious rival to clean up. Bristol's Opdivo and Merck's Keytruda are shaping up to be the biggest blockbusters ever for the pharma industry. The drugs have proven to be effective against forms of lung, skin, kidney and other cancers by cutting the brakes on the immune system's response. In the second quarter, Bristol sold $840 million of Opdivo - almost seven times as much as the same period last year. Taking on tobacco has provided the most glittering prize. Sales of Opdivo, Keytruda and related drugs for lung cancer will exceed $20 billion in 2022 according to Cowen. The biggest chunk of this will come from previously untreated patients. The key to bringing in even more revenue stems from showing such drugs work on more forms of cancer and using these treatments earlier. Merck took a relatively safe path. It proved in June that Keytruda worked in untreated non-small cell lung cancer patients whose tumours had at least 50 per cent of cells producing a protein called PD-L1. Various trials have shown that the success of Keytruda and Opdivo is highly linked, but not entirely, to having cells that produce this protein. There aren't, though, too many patients with such a high amount of PD-L1. Bristol went for the kill. Its drug already sells over two times as much as Merck's, and it designed a trial to widen this lead, targeting patients with tumours with just 5 per cent or more of cells producing PD-L1. That's a far harder target to hit, but would also have opened up a lot more patients to treatment. Bristol will now probably have to wait until 2018 to hit back at its rival. That's when a trial of Opdivo in combination with another drug for treating lung cancer should report. Earlier trials suggest this is a remarkably effective way to treat the disease. Until then, Merck has a clear path to gain market share - and the $11 billion added to its market value Friday morning implies shareholders agree. It's a pricey therapy for Bristol's hubris.

On Friday, they felt the other side of that concentrated bet. The drop in the shares on Friday — the worst in more than 16 years — had as much to do with the failure of Bristol-Myers’s drug Opdivo in a clinical trial for lung cancer as it did with investors’ now-shaken confidence in the New York-based company’s ability to be the breakaway leader in the field. It was also a stark reminder of the risks of drug development. No other large pharmaceutical company has recently focused on one disease area like Bristol-Myers has, in this case by targeting drugs that leverage the immune system to attack tumors. The trial results, which showed that Opdivo failed to do better than chemotherapy at keeping previously untreated patients’ cancer from progressing, have left the door open for competitors like Merck & Co, AstraZeneca PLC and Roche Holding AG. Bristol-Myers shares were down 16 percent to US$63.28 at the close in New York. Merck gained 10 percent to US$63.86. Immunotherapy is a market potentially worth billions of dollars a year — Opdivo is predicted by analysts to bring in US$10.7 billion in 2020, and the immune-system drugs are projected to make up almost half of Bristol-Myers’ sales by that time. Lung cancer is the biggest killer in oncology, according to the American Cancer Society, and the drugs have thus far been largely approved for cancers that affect fewer patients. Bristol-Myers does not have any plans to alter its focus just yet or diversify away from cancer. “It is clear, because of our track record of success, the expectations are high,” chief executive officer Giovanni Caforio said in a telephone interview on Friday. “It does really not change our focus and it does not change the long-term potential of Opdivo; it does not impact our commitment to making immuno-oncology the central pillar of our strategy.” Friday’s results also expose the difference between the development strategies at Bristol-Myers and Merck, which has a competing drug in the same class, called Keytruda. Merck designed its study to exclude patients with lower levels of a key biomarker thought to predict response to the drug. While that meant a smaller market, it meant a higher probability of success — and the trial reported positive results in June. Bristol-Myers’ trial included patients with lower levels of the biomarker. Caforio said Bristol-Myers is still pushing ahead in studying previously untreated patients, but with combination drugs that could help more patients respond to the treatments, rather than just the ones with the highest levels of biomarkers in their tumors. Those results might not be ready until 2018. “Our strategy continues to be the best strategy,” Caforio said. The expectation is “not that every single trial will work, and it’s not about who wins every time one trial is completed,” he said. This story has been viewed 1700 times. Comments will be moderated.

Under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, this indication for KEYTRUDA is approved based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. For HNSCC patients, PD-L1 testing is not needed prior to use of KEYTRUDA. The approval is based on data from the KEYNOTE-012 study, which included patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC who had disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy or following platinum-containing chemotherapy administered as part of induction, concurrent, or adjuvant therapy and ECOG performance status (PS) of zero or one. The data showed an objective response rate (ORR) of 16 percent (95% ci:11)(95% ci:22), complete response rate of five percent, with responses of six months or longer observed in 82 percent (n=23/28) of the responding patients. ORR and duration of response were similar regardless of human papilloma virus (HPV) status. Immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred with KEYTRUDA including pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, and nephritis. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, KEYTRUDA should be withheld or discontinued and corticosteroids administered. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Female patients of reproductive potential should be advised of the potential hazard to a fetus. For more information regarding immune-mediated adverse reactions and use in pregnancy, see “Selected Important Safety Information” below. “Today’s approval represents a meaningful advance for the oncology community, as well as for our head and neck cancer clinical program,” said Dr. Roger M. Perlmutter, president, Merck Research Laboratories. “Together with prior approvals in the treatment of other tumor types, today’s action by the FDA underscores our tireless commitment to addressing the unmet needs of patients suffering from a broad range of cancers.” KEYNOTE-012 was the first clinical study to investigate the role of a PD-1 inhibitor in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Merck currently has the largest immuno-oncology clinical development program, including multiple registration-enabling studies in head and neck cancer, and is conducting research investigating KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) as a monotherapy, as well as in combination with chemotherapy compared to the current standard of care. “Head and neck cancer is a complex disease that historically has been associated with high recurrence rates and poor long-term outcomes, highlighting the critical need for new treatment options,” said Dr. Tanguy Seiwert, associate director of the Head and Neck Cancer Program and assistant professor of medicine at The University of Chicago. “The approval of KEYTRUDA for previously treated patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is an important step forward in treating this disease.” KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. “Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma presents unique challenges including limited treatment options, especially for patients with recurrent or metastatic disease,” said Holly Boykin, executive director, Head and Neck Cancer Alliance. “We welcome the approval of KEYTRUDA as a new treatment option for people whose lives are impacted by this devastating disease.” Data Supporting the Approval The accelerated FDA approval was based on a multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, multi-cohort phase 1b study, KEYNOTE-012, that evaluated safety in 192 patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC and ECOG PS of zero or one; efficacy was evaluated in 174 of these patients who had disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy administered for recurrent or metastatic HNSCC or following platinum-containing chemotherapy administered as part of induction, concurrent, or adjuvant therapy. Patients were enrolled regardless of tumor HPV status (33% were HPV-positive). The median number of prior lines of therapy administered for the treatment of HNSCC was two. Nearly all (95%) of the patients enrolled had prior radiation therapy. Patients received KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) at a dose of 10 mg/kg every two weeks (n=53) or a 200 mg fixed dose every three weeks (n=121) until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients without disease progression were treated for up to 24 months. Treatment with KEYTRUDA could be reinitiated for subsequent disease progression and administered for up to one additional year. The primary efficacy outcome measures were ORR according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR), and duration of response. Efficacy analysis showed an ORR of 16 percent (95% ci:11)(95% ci:22) with a complete response rate of five percent. The median follow-up time was 8.9 months. Among the 28 responding patients, the median duration of response had not been reached (range 2.4+ to 27.7+ months), with 23 patients having responses of six months or longer. The ORR and duration of response were similar irrespective of dosage regimen (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 200 mg every 3 weeks) or HPV status. In HNSCC, serious adverse reactions occurred in 45 percent of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least two percent of patients were pneumonia, dyspnea, confusional state, vomiting, pleural effusion, and respiratory failure. The incidence of adverse reactions, including serious adverse reactions, was similar between dosage regimens (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 200 mg every 3 weeks). The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) were fatigue (46%), decreased appetite (22%), and dyspnea (20%). Adverse reactions in patients with HNSCC were generally similar to those occurring in patients with melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with the exception of increased incidences of facial edema (10% all Grades; 2.1% Grades 3-4) and new or worsening hypothyroidism. About KEYTRUDA [®] (pembrolizumab) KEYTRUDA is administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every three weeks for the approved indications. KEYTRUDA for injection is supplied in a 100 mg single use vial. KEYTRUDA Indications and Dosing Melanoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma at a dose of 2 mg/kg every three weeks. Lung Cancer KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors express PD-L1 as determined by an FDA-approved test with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy, at a dose of 2 mg/kg every three weeks. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab). This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. An improvement in survival or disease-related symptoms has not yet been established. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. Head and Neck Cancer KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA [®]  (pembrolizumab) Immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases, occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging and administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA. Hypophysitis occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency). Administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. New or worsening hypothyroidism occurred in 28 (14.6%) of 192 patients, including Grade 3 (0.5%) hypothyroidism. Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. Administer replacement hormones for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer anti-hyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia. Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis. Other clinically important immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction. Severe and life-threatening infusion-related reactions have been reported in 3 (0.1%) of 2117 patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 17 percent of 192 patients. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 45 percent of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2 percent of patients were pneumonia, dyspnea, confusional state, vomiting, pleural effusion, and respiratory failure. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) were fatigue (46%), decreased appetite (22%), and dyspnea (20%). It is not known whether KEYTRUDA is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, instruct women to discontinue nursing during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the final dose. Safety and effectiveness of KEYTRUDA have not been established in pediatric patients.

(NYSE: MRK) from Market Perform to Outperform, boosting his price target by $10, to $72. Bristol said that its CheckMate-026 study in first-line NSCLC had not managed to meet its primary PFS endpoint, and BMO analysts see this as a positive event for Merck’s Keytruda. In fact, they anticipate “seismic commercial market share implications,” given that they expect NSCLC to be the biggest IO indication. Following this development, BMO now argues that Keytruda will probably dominate the first line (1L) NSCLC space, where patients are not only healthier, but also receive more aggressive treatment over a longer period of time. Related Link: Bristol's Opdivo Misses Endpoint In Late-Stage Trial: Merck Rallies Sharply Amid Keytruda Potential The report explained that the most relevant difference with its own KN-042 trial and Bristol’s CM-026 study is that “the primary endpoint for KN-042 is OS (NOT PFS), where there is better data.” Thus, they now see a higher chance of success for KN-042, and have consequently upped their estimates to reflect this potential. The firm now forecast that Merck will see revenue CAGR of 5 percent and EPS growth of at least 14 percent from 2016 to 2020. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

But when it’s time to collate the results, she often shuttles from machine to machine gathering information. “I have to go to each piece of equipment individually to transfer the data or access each device remotely,” says Rieder, a biologist at Philochem, a Swiss biotechnology company. “It would help if all the lab equipment were somehow connected.” There is, as they say, an app for that—and soon there will be many, as pharmaceutical companies, lab-equipment makers, and startups seek to solve the problem. While the technology in machines such as gene sequencers, centrifuges, and bioreactors keeps advancing, individual devices rarely communicate with one another. In many labs, technicians rely on screen shots, pens, and paper to share data, an inefficient process that increases the risk of mistakes. “There’s a lot of manual typing-in,” says Dana Vanderwall, an executive at drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb. Researchers should be able to “focus on doing science and not on the idiosyncrasies of this or that piece of equipment or this or that data format.” “I have to go to each piece of equipment individually to transfer the data or access each device remotely. It would help if all the lab equipment were somehow connected.” —Ulrike Rieder, a Philochem biologist Germany’s Merck KGaA is developing software that automates experiments and predicts when machines are about to run out of chemicals or other materials, then allows one-click ordering of supplies—“the Amazon of life science,” as Merck executive Udit Batra puts it. GlaxoSmithKline, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and more than a dozen other companies are collaborating through the nonprofit Allotrope Foundation to develop common standards for lab data. Proponents say these could one day organize scientific results much as HTML provides a lingua franca for websites, no matter the browser used. Efforts to smooth the research process are hampered by the large number of companies that make lab equipment. They all have their own software, and for complex experiments each machine may need separate instructions. Allotrope is developing standards intended to be device-agnostic, allowing scientists using different equipment to collaborate seamlessly. Equipment manufacturers are working on proprietary systems optimized for devices they sell. Thermo Fisher Scientific offers a web platform for uploading data and analyzing it using a suite of apps, with the ability to monitor experiments remotely from a smartphone. The goal is “driving the inefficiencies of the currently cobbled-together data analysis out of the system,” says Joe Beery, Thermo Fisher’s chief information officer. “The researchers just want the answer.” London startup Synthace seeks to foster communication with what it dubs an operating system for lab equipment. The system, called Antha, lets scientists specify what they’re trying to study, suggests experiments, and controls lab hardware, pausing when necessary to prompt a human to, for example, insert a new plate of liquid samples. The experimental steps and data are recorded in a common format. Synthace has developed “drivers”—not unlike those a computer uses to communicate with printers—for a dozen devices from about 10 manufacturers, including Roche and PerkinElmer. Synthace’s Antha operating system for lab equipment. Eventually, Synthace says, use of Antha could become widespread enough that compatibility with the system will be a selling point for a device, encouraging manufacturers to create drivers themselves. The company in October announced a partnership with Merck (no relation to Merck KGaA), and it’s in negotiations with four other major pharma companies to bring Antha into their labs. Dow Chemical is using Antha to design crop chemicals. “It’s taken me about five years of associating with computer programmers to realize they’ve got much more sophisticated tools” than many scientists, says co-founder Markus Gershater, a biochemist and Synthace’s chief scientific officer. “That’s not a hardware problem—the hardware’s fantastic. It’s a software problem.” —With Doni Bloomfield The bottom line: Equipment makers and startups are racing to streamline scientific research by enabling lab machines to communicate.

(AAPL) and Tiffany & Co. (TIF) View All Posts Breaking news and a long-term bottom in a fan-favorite stock take the lead on this morning’s Three Big Stock Charts. Just a short time ago, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY) announced that the trial of their drug named Opdivo did not meet endpoint survival goals. The news has Bristol-Myers shares gapping lower while Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) shares are surging on increased sales implications of Keytruda due to less competition. From the longer view, Fitbit Inc (NYSE:FIT) shares have gained some traction that’s worth taking a closer look. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY) As mentioned, Bristol-Myers announced that a trial investigating the use of Opdivo did not meet its primary endpoint of progression-free survival in patients with previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The results of the news have Bristol-Myers shares trading around $63, almost 16% lower than last nights close. The gap lower will wipe out 12 months of growth for Bristol-Myers, likely sparking a round of intermediate- and long-term selling as the stock will almost instantly shift from a long-term bull market trend to a bearish trend. This move, like any other fast decline, will also create a short-term oversold signal from Bristol-Myers RSI readings. Traders should watch for this to combine with round-numbered support from the $60 price level to potentially grab the stock for a dead cat bounce that could pocket 5% to 10% after this move, or steer clear of the shares as a new technical trend will need to form in reaction to today’s shake-up. Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) The winner of Bristol-Myers’ bad news is Merck & Co whose drug, Keytruda just lost a key competitor in the market. The results in pre-market trading had Merck shares trading 17% higher. The move higher fortifies a long-term transition that had already been in the works for Merck shares after they spent the last three months transitioning into an intermediate-term bullish trend with its 200-day moving average shifting into an ascending pattern. In addition, today’s move will increase the momentum readings for Merck based on its MACD. Like Bristol-Myers, Merck is likely to see some regression from this short-term move as traders will take the opportunity to close out some large profits. However, due to the impact on long-term fundamentals, any overbought selling should be shallow and limited. In other words, this trend is likely to hold and become even stronger as Merck moves into New High territory. Fitbit Inc (FIT) Traders have been looking for an opportunity to make money on Fitbit on every dip since the stock topped out over $50 and it looks like they’ve got their chance now after bottoming at $12.50. Fitbit shares have spent the last three months trying to build a bottom above $12.50, successfully. Now, the most recent earnings report has given the shares a fundamental driver and even some hope that the company may be eyed as an acquisition target. Priceline Group Inc: Don’t Trust the Post-Earnings Rally in PCLN Stock Fitbit shares are a little overbought right now according to their short-term RSI. However, the trendline improvements are suggesting that there is additional upside for the stock. This week, the 20-day moving average is crossing above the 50-day moving average. In-house we refer to this as a “silver cross.” The last occurrence of this pattern was in April ahead of a 20% rally in shares over a one-month period. As of this writing, the Johnson Research Group did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Financial and technology stocks soared and investors sold the safe assets they have favored for most of this year. The Labor Department said U.S. employers added 255,000 jobs in July, far more than investors expected and the second straight month of strong gains after shaky reports this spring. Stocks made their biggest gain in almost a month. Banks traded higher as investors anticipated higher interest rates and bigger profits on mortgages and other loans. The Nasdaq composite closed at a record high as tech stocks continued to climb. Consumer companies also made big gains. Investors sold bonds, precious metals, and phone and utility companies, safe investments that soared earlier this year as investors worried about the health of the economy. "It looks like the economy is improving, it looks like corporate earnings are on the upswing," said Sam Stovall, U.S. equity strategist for S&P Capital IQ. That marks a change from earlier this year, he said, when investors worried the U.S. would fall into a recession and tech companies would suffer as businesses cut spending. But tech stocks have come back to lead the market higher over the last few months. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 191.48 points, or 1 percent, to 18,543.53. The Standard & Poor's 500 index climbed 18.62 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,182.87. The Nasdaq advanced 54.87 points, or 1.1 percent, to 5,221.12. The strong jobs report suggests that Britain's vote to leave the European Union in late June didn't have much effect on hiring plans for U.S. companies. The unemployment rate remained at 4.9 percent and hourly pay continued to rise. The hiring spree follows an even larger surge in June and represents a turnaround from weak job growth in the first half of this year, including disappointing job gains in April and May. Banks rose the most, as higher interest rates boost their profits on lending. Bank of America rose 57 cents, or 3.9 percent, to $15.05 and Citigroup added $1.88, or 4.3 percent, to $45.72. Kate Warne, an investment strategist for Edward Jones, said the report reassured investors but won't vanquish their fears entirely. "With an election where both candidates are likely to talk about how badly the economy is doing and how disappointing growth has been, investors as a whole are more anxious than the job picture would suggest," she said. The Federal Reserve has been saying for months that it intends to raise interest rates if the economy's strength warrants it. July's report provides more evidence the economy is doing well, boosting the chances that interest rates will go up. But Warne said investor views on the economy and the Fed will keep fluctuating. "When the Fed indicates that they're data dependent, that means investors are going to be data dependent as well," she said. Bond prices fell and the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note jumped to 1.59 percent from 1.50 percent. Kraft Heinz, the company behind Oscar Mayer bologna, Jell-O pudding and Velveeta cheese, also traded higher after it reported a larger profit than analysts expected. Its stock picked up $3.25, or 3.8 percent, to $88.79. After Bristol-Myers Squibb said one of its cancer drugs failed in a clinical trial, its stock suffered its biggest slump since 2000. Meanwhile rival drugmaker Merck soared by the most in seven years. Bristol-Myers sank $12.04, or 16 percent, to $63.28 after saying its drug Opdivo did not halt progression of non-small cell lung cancer in the study. Merck makes a drug called Keytruda that also stimulates patients' immune systems to fight lung cancer. The company, which took in $533 million from Keytruda this year, rose $6.02, or 10.4 percent, to $63.86. Merck was the largest gainer among S&P 500 stocks, and Bristol-Myers Squibb took the largest loss. Security software maker FireEye tumbled after it reported weak sales, cut its forecasts and announced job cuts. Its stock plunged $2.02, or 12.1 percent, to $14.73. Rival software firm Symantec disclosed a larger profit and better sales than expected in its fiscal first quarter, and its full-year profit forecast was stronger than expected. Its stock climbed 86 cents, or 4.1 percent, to $21.89. Benchmark U.S. crude slid 13 cents to $41.80 per barrel in New York while Brent crude, used to price international oils, dipped 2 cents to $44.27 a barrel in London. The price of gold fell $23, or 1.7 percent, to $1,344.40 an ounce, its biggest loss since May. Silver fell 63 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $19.82 an ounce. Copper lost 2 cents to $2.15 a pound. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline held steady at $1.38 a gallon. Heating oil lost 1 cent to $1.32 a gallon. Natural gas fell 6 cents to $2.77 per 1,000 cubic feet. The dollar rose to 101.75 yen from 101.17 yen and the euro fell to $1.1091 from $1.1127. European stocks also advanced. France's CAC-40 rose 1.5 percent and the DAX in Germany advanced 1.4 percent. London's FTSE 100 was 0.8 percent higher. The Shanghai Composite Index shed 0.2 percent and Tokyo's Nikkei 225 was little changed. In South Korea, the Kospi rose 0.9 percent.

 The $75 billion biotech giant Biogen surged on a report of a potential takeover Portia Crowe Aug. 2, 2016, 2:52 PM 9,276 facebook linkedin twitter email print Biogen, the $75 billion biotech giant, surged on Tuesday after a report that it had received takeover interest. The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday reported that Merck and Allergan have each informally expressed interest in doing a deal. The talk of a takeover comes just days after Biogen said that its CEO, George Scangos, would leave the company after six years at its helm. A takeover of Biogen would be the biggest of a biotech company since 2008, and one of the largest takeovers by a drug company on record. RBC's Michael Yee predicted in a note on Tuesday that a takeover could value Biogen at $375 to $475 a share. It was trading around $300 a share before the news broke earlier on Tuesday. Investing.com Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Biogen makes drugs that treat multiple sclerosis and hemophilia, and its main focus overall is on neurological and autoimmune diseases, as well as rare diseases. As Business Insider's Lydia Ramsey reports, Biogen on Monday officially got the rights to sell a promising spinal muscular atrophy drug globally. The drug, nusinersen, succeeded in a late-stage trial, the company said. Drugmakers embarked on a record deal-making spree in 2014 and 2015, as they sought to rebuild drug pipelines as older drugs lost patent protection. Several of the largest biotech takeovers of those years became fiercely competitive as huge drugmakers tapped low-cost debt for the spending. A representative for Allergan said that the company "does not comment on market rumor or speculation." A representative for Merck also declined to comment. Biogen could not immediately be reached for comment.

Mumps outbreak in Long Island likely caused by vaccine-resistant virus; majority of those affected were immunized Saturday, August 06, 2016 by: Isabelle Z. Tags: mumps outbreak, vaccine shedding, MMR vaccine (NaturalNews) Long Beach has been hit with a mumps outbreak that is vaccine-resistant. According to health officials in the Long Island town, almost two dozen individuals are believed to have contracted the virus, with four confirmed cases and at least 14 suspected ones. All of the cases involve people in their 20s, and the outbreak is being attributed to a new vaccine-resistant strain of the virus. In fact, most of those who have contracted mumps in this case have been vaccinated against it. Despite this, officials are actually urging people who have been in contact with those who are infected to get a mumps booster shot! If this strain of the virus is vaccine-resistant, and those who have been vaccinated are getting it anyway, why should people get yet another vaccine? It's also worth noting that none of the people currently affected are seriously ill. The symptoms of mumps tend to be mild, and include swollen cheeks, a headache, body aches and low-grade fever. There is no treatment, and it usually clears up on its own in just a few days. Mumps is, however, highly contagious. It can be transmitted through the transfer of saliva, sneezing or coughing. As beach season continues in full swing, some Long Beach restaurants are even supplying diners with plastic cups as a means of stemming the outbreak. People who have symptoms of the illness are being advised to stay home for five days to avoid spreading it. Controversy over mumps component of MMR vaccine As some Natural News readers may recall, two Merck scientists filed a False Claims Act complaint back in 2010 saying that the Big Pharma firm knowingly falsified mumps vaccine data in order to come up with an efficacy rate of 95 percent. They achieved this by spiking the blood test involved with antibodies taken from animals. This not only allowed them to earn hundreds of millions of dollars from the U.S. government, but also helped them crush the competition and monopolize the vaccine market. The complainants said that Merck never tested the vaccine against actual mumps viruses out in the real world, and alleged that senior management was aware of this and allowed it to happen. That's why it's so important to seek out studies that are free from industry collusion. Mumps outbreaks becoming fairly common among the vaccinated Mumps outbreaks seem to be occurring a lot lately. Earlier this year, for example, the illness broke out at Harvard and a handful of other Boston colleges. More than three quarters of those afflicted had been vaccinated. Dozens of university students in Illinois came down with mumps last year, despite the majority of them having previously been administered two rounds of the MMR vaccine. Do you spot a trend here? It's important to note that not only does the MMR vaccine not actually prevent mumps, but it might actually be responsible for spreading it. That's because the injection contains a weakened version of the live virus, which causes an infection in the body. It can then be "shed" to other people, such as those who have not been vaccinated, or those who have compromised immune systems. That's why it makes absolutely no sense that authorities are urging people who have been exposed to get yet another vaccine. Of course, there are other reasons people might want to avoid the vaccine besides the fact that it doesn't protect against mumps. The MMR vaccine has been linked to a number of harmful effects, including neurological damage, autism, developmental delays, seizure disorders, asthma and autoimmune dysfunction, to name just a few.

Yesterday, they felt the other side of that concentrated bet. The drop in the shares yesterday — the worst in more than 16 years — had as much to do with the failure of Bristol-Myers’s drug Opdivo in a clinical trial for lung cancer as it did with investors’ now-shaken confidence in the New York-based company’s ability to be the breakaway leader in the field. It’s also a stark reminder of the risks of drug development. No other large pharmaceutical company has recently focused on one disease area like Bristol-Myers has, in this case by targeting drugs that leverage the immune system to attack tumours. The trial results, which showed that Opdivo failed to do better than chemotherapy at keeping previously untreated patients’ cancer from progressing, have left the door open for competitors like Merck & Co., AstraZeneca Plc and Roche Holding AG. Bristol-Myers shares were down 16 per cent to US$63.28 (RM255.60) at the close in New York. Merck gained 10 per cent to US$63.86. Massive market Immunotherapy is a market potentially worth billions of dollars a year — Opdivo is predicted by analysts to bring in US$10.7 billion in 2020, and the immune-system drugs are projected to make up almost half of Bristol-Myers’s sales by that time. Lung cancer is the biggest killer in oncology, according to the American Cancer Society, and the drugs have thus far been largely approved for cancers that affect fewer patients. “Given that we expect lung cancer to be the largest immuno-oncology indication, this is a seismic event in terms of market share implications,” Alex Arfaei, an analysts with BMO Capital Markets, said in a note to clients about the Opdivo trial results. He has a market perform rating on the shares. Even with the drop, Bristol-Myers is an expensive stock to own. The 11-member Standard & Poor’s 500 Pharmaceuticals Index, which includes Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer Inc., Merck, along with Bristol-Myers, has a price-to-earnings ratio of 24. Before yesterday’s drop, Bristol-Myers was trading at a ratio of 36. It’s been more expensive than the rest of the index since 2013. Bristol-Myers doesn’t have any plans to alter its focus just yet or diversify away from cancer. ‘Expectations are high’ “It is clear, because of our track record of success, the expectations are high,” Chief Executive Officer Giovanni Caforio said in a phone interview yesterday. “It does really not change our focus and it does not change the long-term potential of Opdivo; it does not impact our commitment to making immuno-oncology the central pillar of our strategy.” That’s not necessarily the approach everyone would like to see the company take, especially with a highly-valued stock that could have been used for deals. “They could’ve made acquisitions,” SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc. analyst John Boris said in a phone interview. The company has acted slowly even as a falling biotech stock market meant some targets might have been available at a discount, he said. “They should’ve been considering how to diversity that revenue stream.” He has a neutral rating on the stock. Different R&D strategies Yesterday’s results also expose the difference between the development strategies at Bristol-Myers and Merck, which has a competing drug in the same class, called Keytruda. Unlike Bristol-Myers, Merck designed its study to exclude patients with lower levels of a key biomarker thought to predict response to the drug. While that meant a smaller market, it meant a higher probability of success — and the trial reported positive results in June. Bristol-Myers’ trial included patients with lower levels of the biomarker. CEO Caforio said Bristol-Myers is still pushing ahead in studying previously untreated patients, but with combination drugs that could help more patients respond to the treatments, rather than just the ones with the highest levels of biomarkers in their tumours. Those results may not be ready until 2018, however. “Our strategy continues to be the best strategy,” Caforio said. The expectation is “not that every single trial will work, and it’s not about who wins every time one trial is completed.” — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Chinese-made US$100b city in Johor 'scares the hell out of everybody' Merkel ‘not happy’ Trump scrapping Pacific trade deal Malaysia refrains from cutting interest rate as ringgit tumbles Cathay Pacific now accepts ringgit for inflight transactions Automakers seek to cut inventories with Black Friday, holiday promotions Chinese-made US$100b city in Johor 'scares the hell out of everybody' Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Malaysia’s central bank says will no longer tolerate ringgit trade in NDF market Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Bank Negara Malaysia says it is intervening in currency market Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: China goes global as Trump puts America first Kids and parents react to 'Beauty and the Beast' Reuters Video: Antigua PM gives Prince Harry awkward honeymoon invite MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Red Shirts heckle yellow-shirted Bersih participants MMOTV: A Red Shirts supporter hurls abuse at Bersih supporters Related Articles Ministry no power to act against drug firms China detains 37 people linked to vaccine scandal French court finds pharma firm Servier responsible in deadly drug scandal The top stocks to watch in Asia today (VIDEO) Plant-based ‘plantibodies’ drugs garner attention Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Financial and technology stocks soared and investors sold the safe assets they have favoured for most of this year. The Labour Department said US employers added 255,000 jobs in July, far more than investors expected and the second straight month of strong gains after shaky reports this spring. Stocks made their biggest gain in almost a month. Banks traded higher as investors anticipated higher interest rates and bigger profits on mortgages and other loans. The Nasdaq composite closed at a record high as tech stocks continued to climb. Consumer companies also made big gains. Investors sold bonds, precious metals, and phone and utility companies, safe investments that soared earlier this year as investors worried about the health of the economy. "It looks like the economy is improving, it looks like corporate earnings are on the upswing," said Sam Stovall, US equity strategist for S&P Capital IQ. That marks a change from earlier this year, he said, when investors worried the US would fall into a recession and tech companies would suffer as businesses cut spending. But tech stocks have come back to lead the market higher over the last few months. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 191.48 points, or 1%, to 18,543.53. The Standard & Poor's 500 index climbed 18.62 points, or 0.9%, to 2,182.87. The Nasdaq advanced 54.87 points, or 1.1%, to 5,221.12. The strong jobs report suggests that Britain's vote to leave the European Union in late June did not have much effect on hiring plans for US companies. The unemployment rate remained at 4.9% and hourly pay continued to rise. The hiring spree follows an even larger surge in June and represents a turnaround from weak job growth in the first half of this year, including disappointing job gains in April and May. Banks rose the most, as higher interest rates boost their profits on lending. Bank of America rose 57 cents, or 3.9%, to $15.05 and Citigroup added $1.88, or 4.3%, to $45.72. Kate Warne, an investment strategist for Edward Jones, said the report reassured investors but will not vanquish their fears entirely. "With an election where both candidates are likely to talk about how badly the economy is doing and how disappointing growth has been, investors as a whole are more anxious than the job picture would suggest," she said. The Federal Reserve has been saying for months that it intends to raise interest rates if the economy's strength warrants it. July's report provides more evidence the economy is doing well, boosting the chances that interest rates will go up. But Warne said investor views on the economy and the Fed will keep fluctuating. "When the Fed indicates that they're data dependent, that means investors are going to be data dependent as well," she said. Bond prices fell and the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note jumped to 1.59% from 1.50%. Kraft Heinz, the company behind Oscar Mayer bologna, Jell-O pudding and Velveeta cheese, also traded higher after it reported a larger profit than analysts expected. Its stock picked up $3.25 dollars, or 3.8%, to $88.79. After Bristol-Myers Squibb said one of its cancer drugs failed in a clinical trial, its stock suffered its biggest slump since 2000. Meanwhile rival drugmaker Merck soared by the most in seven years. Bristol-Myers sank $12.04 dollars, or 16%, to $63.28 after saying its drug Opdivo did not halt progression of non-small cell lung cancer in the study. Merck makes a drug called Keytruda that also stimulates patients' immune systems to fight lung cancer. The company, which took in $533m from Keytruda this year, rose $6.02, or 10.4%, to $63.86. Merck was the largest gainer among S&P 500 stocks, and Bristol-Myers Squibb took the largest loss. Security software maker FireEye tumbled after it reported weak sales, cut its forecasts and announced job cuts. Its stock plunged 2.02 dollars, or 12.1%, to $14.73. Rival software firm Symantec disclosed a larger profit and better sales than expected in its fiscal first quarter, and its full-year profit forecast was stronger than expected. Its stock climbed 86 cents, or 4.1%, to $21.89. Benchmark US crude slid 13 cents to $41.89 per barrel in New York while Brent crude, used to price international oils, dipped two cents to $44.27 a barrel in London. The price of gold fell $23, or 1.7%, to $1,344.40 an ounce, its biggest loss since May. Silver fell 63 cents, or 3.1%, to $19.82 an ounce. Copper lost two cents to $2.15 a pound. In other energy trading, wholesale petrol held steady at $1.38 a gallon. Heating oil lost one cent to 1.32 dollars a gallon. Natural gas fell six cents to $2.77 per 1,000 cubic feet. The dollar rose to 101.75 yen from 101.17 yen and the euro fell to $1.1091 from $1.1127. European stocks also advanced. France's CAC-40 rose 1.5% and the Dax in Germany advanced 1.4%. London's FTSE 100 was 0.8% higher. The Shanghai Composite Index shed 0.2% and Tokyo's Nikkei 225 was little changed. In South Korea, the Kospi rose 0.9%. send us stuff PreviousNext Want us to email you the top news stories each lunchtime?

Bristol-Myers Squibb got killed on Friday after the pharma powerhouse shocked investors by announcing its best-selling Opdivo — which has proved to be effective against skin, kidney and other cancers — had failed in a lung cancer trial. Its stock fell 16 percent to close at $63.28, causing more than $20 billion in shareholder value to evaporate in a single day. “This is a significant negative surprise for Bristol-Myers given the consensus expectation was for trial success,” Merrill Lynch analysts wrote in an update. Before Friday, Opdivo held such promise in the hot new field of immunotherapy that the May issue of Pharmaceutical Executive Magazine designated it “Brand of the Year.” Opdivo also excited such stock pickers as Jim Cramer, who last month praised Bristol-Myers for its “amazing oncology franchises.” And in March, after the stock climbed 30 percent from its 52-week low, he touted it on his “Mad Money” show: “Even at $66, I remain a solid buyer.” The stock continued its climb into the $70 range before a study of 541 cancer patients determined Opdivo was no better than chemotherapy in slowing the progression of advanced lung cancer. Cancer is second only to heart disease as a cause of death, according to the Centers for Disease Control. And lung cancer ranks as the leading cause of cancer death, taking more lives each year than colon, breast and prostate cancers combined, according to the American Cancer Society. Opdivo and a competing Merck drug, Keytruda, were approved as melanoma treatments in 2014. Bristol-Myers’ entry had a faster start than Merck’s, achieving second-quarter sales of $840 million and $314 million, respectively. But in vying to become a first-line lung-cancer treatment — authorized for patients new to therapy — Opdivo aimed for the entire market. In contrast, Keytruda targeted only those patients rich with tumor-produced proteins that, theoretically, gave both drugs a better chance of success. The inability of Opdivo to treat even protein-rich patients was the biggest surprise of the late-stage trial, especially since Keytruda successfully reached its “endpoints” two months ago in a narrower trial. “Merck will now likely enjoy the benefit of the only immunotherapy to be approved in first-line cancer and will enjoy this exclusivity for at least 12 months,” Merrill Lynch reported. Keytruda’s new lead on $13 billion in annual sales previously predicted for Opdivo sent Merck’s shares up 10 percent Friday to close at $63.86. And its gain of $16.7 billion — coupled with the Bristol-Myers’ loss of $20.1 billion — produced a single-day swing of nearly $37 billion between the two competitors.

By EmmaCourt Reporter Expectations were running high for Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.’s cancer drug Opdivo as the company took on late-stage clinical trials for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, a market with blockbuster potential and one that several rival drug manufacturers also had their eye on. So when the company BMY, -0.27%  reported the trial’s failure before the opening bell on Friday, the news sent its stock plummeting as much as 19% in premarket trades. At the same time, shares of rival Merck & Co. MRK, -0.67% jumped 6.8%, and shares of AstraZeneca AZN, -0.32%  climbed 2.2%. Those two pharmaceutical companies are developing competing lung-cancer drugs. The failure “is a MAJOR SURPRISE — possibly the biggest clinical surprise of my career,” wrote longtime pharma analyst Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Read: Failed lung-cancer drug trial sends Bristol Myers stock plunging and Merck’s shares up Opdivo got top billing last week when Bristol-Myers reported its second-quarter earnings, with the blockbuster drug — already approved for four types of cancer — driving an increase in global revenues. Opdivo and Merck’s Keytruda both aim to treat non-small-cell lung cancer before chemotherapy is used, allowing for a much larger patient population. That market is likely worth more than $12 billion in total, of which Opdivo was expected to capture $7 billion to $8 billion by 2021, Schoenebaum said. But compared with Keytruda, which recently reported positive trial results, Bristol-Myers took a much more “aggressive” strategy with Opdivo, gearing it toward a larger variety of patients, said Brad Loncar, chief executive officer of Loncar Investments, which offers a cancer immunotherapy ETF CNCR, -1.34% . “Their strategy of going for as wide a patient population as possible worked very well in other stages” — until now, said Loncar, whose ETF holds shares in both Bristol-Myers and Merck.

So-called “combination therapies” have been hotly anticipated by investors in this treatment area, Schoenebaum said, so the impact of this trial’s failure “may turn out to be short-lived.” Related: Four high-quality biotech companies trading like risky startups Opdivo is “active” for first-line lung cancer, “just not as good as hoped,” not beating the effects of chemotherapy, said Leerink analysts in a Friday note. Their evaluation of Merck’s Keytruda treatment compared with Opdivo show “the products appear to perform very similarly overall,” separate from the patient population in the trials. Bristol-Myers did not expand upon potential reasons for the trial’s failure. It did, however, eliminate factors such as enrollment anomalies and the size, length and statistical analysis in conversations with Schoenebaum, he said. “I actually think they deserve credit for trying to help as many patients as possible,” Loncar said. “Sometimes it just doesn’t work out.” More from MarketWatch Opinion Journal: The New Trump Democrats The Task of Securing President-Elect Donald Trump Giuliani’s Trump-Like Audition for Secretary of State Related Topics U.S. Stocks Markets Investing MarketWatch Partner Center We Want to Hear from You Join the conversation Comment Luxury Real Estate Billionaire Ron Burkle is buyer behind Bob Hope’s iconic Palm Springs mansion View More Donald Trump Insight and analysis on a Donald Trump presidency View More Real Estate News Melania Trump may be right: Moving in middle of school year could mess up kids View More Investing Opinion: A 12-step plan to strengthen your portfolio after Trump's victory View More MarketWatch Site Index Topics Help Feedback Newsroom Roster Media Archive Premium Products Mobile Company Company Info Code of Conduct Corrections Advertising Media Kit Advertise Locally Reprints & Licensing Broker Center Your Ad Choices Dow Jones Network WSJ.com Barron's Online BigCharts Virtual Stock Exchange Financial News Online WSJ.com Small Business realtor.com Mansion Global Back to Top Copyright ©2016 MarketWatch, Inc.

Both the broad-based S&P 500 and the tech-rich Nasdaq finished at all-time highs after the Labor Department reported a big gain in jobs in July and upgraded employment estimates for the prior two months. Each of the major US indices rose about one percent including the Dow, which ended only 12 points away from a record of its own. "The US economy may not be going gangbusters but it remains the best equity alternative of any worldwide index," said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities. "The most important takeaway from a better jobs report is an indication of a continued grind higher in the US economy." Meanwhile, the London stock market rose 0.8 percent to above 6,800 for the first time in 14 months, as European equities built on earlier gains seen after the Bank of England Thursday announced an interest rate cut and surprise stimulus in response to the British vote to leave the European Union. Paris and Frankfurt both rose about 1.5 percent. The Labor Department said the US economy added 255,000 jobs in July, easily topping the analyst forecast for an increase of 185,000 payrolls. It also reported growth in hourly wages, a weak point in some earlier reports that have shown employment growth. The strong report helped markets shrug off some lackluster US data of late, including a report a week ago that estimated second-quarter growth at just 1.2 percent. "This was good economic data, replete with strong and relatively broad-based job growth, higher wage growth and an increase in the average workweek," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare. "The economy does appear to be stable and on a slightly more upwards trajectory," said David Levy, portfolio manager at Republic Wealth Advisors. The jobs report also boosts the odds of a Federal Reserve interest rate increase this year, but probably not before December, analysts said. That expectation accentuated movements in the foreign exchange market following the British monetary stimulus, boosting the dollar at the expense of the euro and the pound. "Hotter than expected wage growth was really the icing on the cake of the very strong data, which has pushed up the odds of the Fed raising lending rates in the months ahead," said Omer Esiner of Commonwealth Foreign Exchange. Banking shares rallied on expectations of higher US interest rates. JPMorgan Chase gained 2.7 percent, Bank of American 3.9 percent and Citigroup 4.3 percent. Technology shares were also generally higher, with Dow members Apple and IBM climbing 1.5 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively. Bristol-Myers Squibb plunged 16.0 percent after announcing that a clinical trial of its Opdivo drug to treat lung cancer failed. The news boosted Dow member Merck, which has a competing drug, pushing shares up a hefty 10.4 percent. Meanwhile, the euro and the British pound fell against the dollar late Friday as stronger-than-expected employment numbers in the United States rallied markets and raised expectations of a US interest rate hike later this year. Towards 1800 GMT, the euro was down against the dollar at $1.1096 versus $1.1131 at 2100 GMT the day before. The pound also fell to $1.3086 from $1.3114 in over the same period. The US Labor Department on Friday said American private and public sector employers had added more than a quarter of a million jobs, beating analyst expectations and helping confirm a robust, upward trend in labor markets. Employment numbers are one factor examined by monetary policy makers in deciding whether to increase key interest rates, which can help drive demand for US currency. "Overall the dollar remains stronger. It will reman supported on the near term following stronger than expected US employment data," said Eric Viloria of Wells Fargo. "The details of the reports overall were solid, including the number of payrolls added, the average hourly earnings," he added. "Unemployment rate was steady but there is an increase in participation, so the report was seen as supportive for the US dollar and an eventual resumption of Fed rates interest hikes later this year. We think December is likely."

According to the investigators, at one point a lab employee pulled a memory stick from a computer and put it in his pocket. When they asked what he had removed, the man ran away. The FDA has never been able to piece together what, if any, drug-manufacturing data were on that memory stick. But its removal became one of a long list of significant deviations that...

Post Your Comments Share Cancel US stocks notched their best day in a month on Friday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closing at record highs after a second straight month of robust labor market data boosted optimism that economic growth is accelerating. The US Labor Department report showed that nonfarm payrolls rose by 255,000 in July, far outpacing expectations for a gain of 180,000. While the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.9 percent, it held below the 5 percent mark associated with full employment. The S&P 500 ended at 2,182.87, its eighth closing high of the year, powered by a 1.9 percent gain in financials, which would be primed for a profit boost should the Federal Reserve raise interest rates. JPMorgan Chase shares gained 2.7 percent to $66.30 and the financial index closed at its highest level of the year. "This is a flat out strong report, there don’t appear to be any holes whatsoever," said Tom Porcelli, chief US economist at RBC Capital Markets in New York. "But we need to temper enthusiasm, with two straight positive payroll reports everyone is going to shift to the other side of the boat - first the boat was sinking and now everyone is going to think the boat is going to take off." Employment numbers were weak in April and May, and a surprisingly strong reading in June left investors unsure of the state of the economy. The June employment number was revised to 292,000 from 287,000. The Fed may still wait for gross domestic product growth to improve and inflation to move closer to its 2 percent target before pulling the trigger on a rate hike. The probability of a hike doubled to 18 percent for September after the jobs report and rose to about 46 percent for December, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 191.21 points, or 1.04 percent, to 18,543.26, the S&P 500 gained 18.57 points, or 0.86 percent, to 2,182.82 and the Nasdaq Composite added 54.87 points, or 1.06 percent, to 5,221.12. The Nasdaq surpassed a record set in July 2015. For the week, the Dow rose 0.6 percent, the S&P 500 gained 0.4 percent and the Nasdaq advanced 1.1 percent. Bristol-Myers plunged 16 percent after its lung cancer drug failed in a late-stage study while Merck, which makes a rival drug, rose 10.4 percent. Bristol-Myers was the biggest drag on the S&P 500, while Merck gave the benchmark index its biggest boost. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.64-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.57-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 29 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 126 new highs and 21 new lows. About 6.77 billion shares changed hands in US exchanges, compared with the 6.58 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.
