Thousands of cattle producers will gather in Indianapolis, Ind., Nov. 5-7 for the event. Among the convention’s most popular sessions is Angus University, sponsored by Merck Animal Health. “Angus University has been a centerpiece of the American Angus Association’s annual convention for three years, and it is a day of learning and exploration for all areas of the beef business,” says Becky Weishaar, Angus Media’s Creative Media director and lead contact for the convention. “We appreciate Merck’s continued support of Angus University, and look forward to participants engaging in another insightful event.” Angus University begins with keynote speaker Howard Putnam, former CEO for Southwest Airlines. Putnam and his team tripled the revenues and profitability in three years at Southwest Airlines, and the company’s culture and policy became a game-changer for the airline industry, casting traditional models out the window. He has published a book titled The Winds of Turbulence, and will share his insights into business and thinking creatively. Putnam grew up on a farm in Iowa, where he learned to fly in a pasture. More than 20 afternoon sessions offer participants a chance to focus on specific management disciplines and learn how they can improve their operations with quality in mind. Topics include: asset protection, business growth, genetic evaluation, marketing, economics, commercial cattle production, herd health and live cattle demonstrations. Registration for the 2016 Angus Convention is available online, and for the best value, register before Aug. 31 for full-access to convention activities, education, entertainment and meals for only $75 per person.

Despite glut of vehicles, MSD wants more Dan Horn , dhorn@enquirer.com 11:05 p.m. EDT August 16, 2016 Buy Photo Melvin Lawson drives a flush vac truck, the largest vehicle in the Metropolitan Sewer District fleet from the agency's Carthage location. (Photo: The Enquirer/Patrick Reddy)Buy Photo Eight months after deciding it might own too many trucks and vans, the Metropolitan Sewer District wants to buy more trucks and vans. The agency in charge of building and maintaining Hamilton County’s sewers is seeking $1.4 million next year for new dump trucks, vans, pickups and other vehicles. Big utilities like MSD buy new vehicles all the time, usually to replace older ones worn out from years of traveling to work sites. But this request is raising eyebrows among the county officials who set MSD’s budget because it comes so soon after the agency concluded it wasn’t using the vehicles it already has as often as it should. An internal review of MSD’s fleet in January found more than 40 percent of its 272 vehicles didn’t meet the city of Cincinnati’s standards for minimum mileage or hours of use. “It is clear that some changes are necessary to ‘right-size’ MSD’s inventory of vehicles/equipment and increase utilization … to an acceptable level,” MSD Director Gerald Checco wrote in the January report. Despite that declaration, Checco said the agency is asking for additional vehicles this year as replacements for old ones that are becoming too costly to maintain and wouldn't easily be swapped out for similar, under-used vehicles already in MSD's inventory. County officials are unconvinced. They say MSD will have to make a stronger case if it wants to spend more money to buy and maintain new vehicles with money from the thousands of homeowners and businesses that pay sewer bills in Hamilton County. "This is money that's coming out of ratepayers' pockets," said County Commissioner Chris Monzel. Wish list: Dump trucks, vans, pickups and more Buy Photo  (Photo: The Enquirer/Patrick Reddy) The list of under-used vehicles includes cars and small pickup trucks that MSD employees drive to work sites and meetings, as well as utility vehicles and dump trucks used for major repairs and construction. Smaller vehicles range in price from about $18,000 to $30,000, while dump trucks can run more than $120,000. Checco said he knows MSD’s vehicles can be better used and he’s working on the problem. He recently set up vehicle pools around the county to give more workers access to trucks, cars and other vehicles. A van once designated for engineers, for example, now might also be used by administrators, or vice versa. Checco also is setting up a tracking system to better monitor the use of vehicles and is encouraging more employees to use MSD cars on the job instead of their own, which could also reduce liability. “Instead of having a bunch of cars used maybe 30 percent of the time, you have them used more,” Checco said. “We will see a better utilization of the vehicles.” That’s all well and good, county officials say, but why is MSD asking for more vehicles now? The budget request for 2017 seeks two new dump trucks, five vans, four pickup trucks and more. The fleet review found that MSD already has eight under-used dump trucks, 22 under-used vans and 13 under-used pickup trucks. CINCINNATI.COM MSD official confirms contract threat “Shouldn’t we be optimizing the use of these vehicles?” said Dave Meyer, the county’s director of utility oversight. “There’s a lot of dump trucks that don’t have many miles on them. Why couldn’t we use them?” Meyer said he first became concerned about MSD’s fleet more than a year ago when he looked out his office window at the sewer district’s headquarters and saw cars and trucks sitting in a parking lot. Over the course of weeks, he said, some of those vehicles didn’t seem to move very often. “I thought, ‘Wow, I wonder how many vehicles aren’t being used,” Meyer said. He started asking questions and last year challenged MSD officials about the need for more cars and trucks. As a result, county officials stripped vehicle requests from last year’s budget. Putting new requests "under a microscope" When Checco took over the top job at MSD last year, he did a deeper dive into the problem and produced the vehicle utilization report. Checco, who has worked for the city for years and has a reputation as a detail-oriented administrator, did a similar study years ago of the city’s entire fleet. He said the new vehicle policies MSD has adopted should help him figure out within the next six months or so how many vehicles the agency really needs. Already, he said, about 10 vehicles have been taken out of service and will likely be sold. “Do we have the proper amount? Right now, we don’t know,” Checco said. He said some of the vehicles MSD wants to replace cost thousands of dollars a year in repairs and, in some cases, are more than a decade old. According to the budget request, the vans that would be replaced have an average mileage of 61,900 and the pickup trucks have an average of 68,300. All were purchased in 2004. Meyer said it might be cheaper for MSD to rent some vehicles on an as-needed basis until it figures out what it needs and what it can do without. He said continuing the freeze on buying new vehicles for another year might not be a bad idea. County commissioners will make the call on the request when they consider the budget proposal this fall. Like Monzel, commissioners Dennis Deters and Todd Portune said they are wary of buying more vehicles for MSD. “I think any request for vehicles would come under a microscope,” said Portune, who hasn’t seen the request yet. “Without knowing more, this would be a tough sell.” If a dispute arises over the vehicles, it would be one of many to pop up in recent years between the city, which operates MSD, and the county, which oversees its budget. Those disagreements grew more intense this year after a series of Enquirer articles exposed questionable spending practices and a lack of oversight at the sewer district. The two governments have feuded all year over how best to run the agency and are mired in a federal court fight over who gets final say over spending. The arrangement that paired the city and county expires in 2018 and both sides are trying to plan for what comes next. Talks are continuing in federal court, but neither side will discuss them. ..... About MSD: Serves 43 out of 49 Hamilton County political subdivisions, plus three adjacent portions of Butler, Clermont and Warren counties. Ratepayer base includes about 230,000 residential and commercial users. MSD provides sewage collection and treatment services to a little more than 290 square miles, containing more than 200,000 separate sewer connections that tie in to about 3,000 miles of sanitary and combined sewers. 32 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 13 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2bpQscn TOP VIDEOS Who is Nikki Haley? 1:30 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 22 17:46 Joe Deters asks for retrial of Ray Tensing, seeks change of venue 3:07 Finding home: A 12-year-old boy's search in the midst of war 6:41 Bills-Bengals postgame wrap 3:10 La Salle wins regional championship 0:55 911 call: I'm being attacked by bear; I'm going to die 1:05 Joe Deters: \u0022I didn't believe the tears for a second\u0022 2:47 Are deals better on Black Friday or Cyber Monday? 1:00 Bengals vs. Bills Week 11 predictions 6:02 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 15. 20:46 Supermoon rises over Cincinnati 0:55 Bengals vs. Giants wrap-up 3:15 Student at UC Tensing forum: 'It's time for war' 0:45 Sam DuBose sister: 'This, to me, is murder' 1:30 Protests in Cincinnati after Ray Tensing mistrial 1:09 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Mistrial declared in Ray Tensing case 3:46 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Most touching ways soldiers reunited with their family 1:17 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29

George Budwell (TMFGBudwell) Aug 18, 2016 at 11:38AM The cancer drug market is already valued at over $100 billion but is still growing at one of the fastest compound annual growth rates in entire the pharmaceutical industry. The underlying reason for this surge in oncology drug sales is the emergence of breakthrough products like Bristol-Myers Squibb's checkpoint inhibitor Opdivo, along with the seemingly never-ending rise in cancer incidence rates across the globe.   That said, the market hasn't exactly been applying rich premiums to the share prices of most cancer therapy stocks of late, perhaps making some of these stocks great bargains for patient investors. Armed with this insight, here is a deeper look at two cancer stocks that are arguably ridiculously cheap based on the long-term prospects of their respective clinical pipelines. Image source: Getty Images. Big pharma is starting to take interest in this tiny immuno-oncology company Agenus (NASDAQ:AGEN) is a tiny cancer immunotherapy company that sports an immense pipeline of checkpoint inhibitors and modulators targeting a rich array of receptors with known anti-tumor properties. As a result, the company has been able to attract partnerships with both Incyte Corp. (NASDAQ:INCY) and Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) to help advance its anti-cancer checkpoint inhibitor platform. The Incyte partnership has already led to the launch of a combined phase 1/2 clinical trial for the anti-GITR checkpoint antibody INCAGN1876 in solid tumors, and the two companies are also reportedly close to initiating another early stage trial for an OX40 agonist antibody sometime in the back half of 2016.  The Merck collaboration is reportedly starting to pick up steam as well. Agenus noted in its second-quarter earnings call, for instance, that Merck has now selected a lead product candidate to advance into preclinical studies, triggering a $2 million milestone payment. The underwhelming part, though, is that Merck hasn't revealed much about the details of this collaboration with Agenus, making it difficult to place a long-term value on this joint effort.  Apart from its collaborations with Incyte and Merck, Agenus is apparently also listening to offers to license out its proprietary CTLA-4 antibody that's currently in a phase 1 stage for advanced solid tumors. While the likelihood of yet another partnership is impossible to handicap at this point, the bigger issue to keep in mind is that the company's checkpoint inhibitor platform has definitely caught of the eye of big pharma at this stage, perhaps leading to even more deals or an outright buyout offer down the line.  Buyout or not, this small-cap biotech is on track to produce a treasure trove of clinical updates starting next year, giving investors ample reasons to dig deeper. The key point is that Agenus' market cap of only $525 million at the moment would seem to make it dirt cheap, given that its checkpoint inhibitor platform has the potential to generate billions in revenues in the not-so-distant future.  Don't sleep on this hidden gem Bellicum Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:BLCM) is an up-and-coming player in the hotly contested adoptive cell therapy space. Although Bellicum is trailing the industry leaders Kite Pharma and Juno Therapeutics in the race to bring one of these novel cell therapies to market, the company does sport a potential game changer with its proprietary Chemical Induction of Dimerization (CID) technology that's designed to make adoptive T cell therapies safer and more potent. Kite and Juno, after all, have both run into trouble with their initial product candidates from a safety standpoint, casting doubt on their ability to move into more profitable, earlier lines of treatment.  Image Source: Getty Images In a promising turn of events, Bellicum recently announced that it may even be able to leapfrog Kite and Juno -- at least in Europe. Specifically, the Houston-based drugmaker said that European authorities are open to considering a regulatory filing for the company's lead product candidate, BPX-501, in pediatric patients with leukemias, lymphomas, and rare inherited blood diseases. The somewhat unusual part is that an approval would be based on the dual phase 1/2 study known as the BP-004 trial. In short, European regulators are apparently willing to forgo a large, randomized trial if BPX-501 continues to shine in its ongoing study, presumably due to the complete lack of treatments for these rare but deadly blood disorders.  In addition to BPX-501, Bellicum is also close to launching early stage clinical trials for its high-affinity T cell receptor (BPX-701) and GoCAR-T (BPX-601) product candidates. According to the company, BPX-701 will initially target blood-based disorders such as refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. And BPX-601 is set to enter a phase 1 study as a possible treatment for non-resectable pancreatic cancer. Although Bellicum's cell-based platform has been progressing at breakneck speed lately, the market apparently hasn't taken notice. Bellicum's market cap of around $508 million, after all, is just a small fraction of the multi-billion dollar valuations of its lead competitors Kite and Juno. To be fair, Kite and Juno's far higher market caps are partly the result of major partnering deals with bigger biotechs. But that fact doesn't totally explain Bellicum's comparatively meager valuation, especially since the biotech is pursuing a handful of therapies with blockbuster potential, and its CID platform could become the gold standard for adoptive cell therapies in general.  Time to buy?  Clinical-stage biotechs are always a high-risk investment. That being said, Agenus and Bellicum are both in the process of building out diverse clinical pipelines aimed at treating several high-value conditions. So, while undoubtedly risky, these two biotechs do offer investors some insurance in the event of a clinical or regulatory setback in the near term. And that's perhaps the main reason that these two stocks might be worth buying ahead of their upcoming catalysts. After all, it's not particularly common for small-cap cancer therapy stocks to sport multiple blockbuster product candidates. George Budwell has no position in any stocks mentioned.

You’re supposed to carry one with you everywhere you go. But in recent years, EpiPens have gotten so expensive that some struggle to afford them. CBS News reports that the price of EpiPens has increased by more than 480 percent since 2009, two years after Mylan purchased the device from Merck. A two-pack used to cost pharmacies about $100. It’s now $600, and they have a stated expiration of one year. But health insurance covers that, right? It depends on your plan. If you’re one of the many people with a high-deductible plan, you could be stuck with the bill. Parents of children with severe allergies are told to have devices at home and school, too, which can add up fast. Two packs can set some people back $1,200. Mylan does offer a patient-assistance program and coupon cards, which allow some people to pay nothing out-of-pocket, but for some families, the coupon saves them $100 per pack — they still owe $500. Emergency medical technicians also use EpiPens and some have resorted to syringes filled with epinephrine to save money. Epinephrine itself is very cheap; Mylan is essentially charging for the patented auto-injector, and they have a virtual monopoly on the market. There is a generic version, but the injector is different (another generic is in development) and a rival device was recalled in October. Marketwatch compared the steep increase to the shady practices of Valeant Pharmaceuticals and anti-hero Martin Shkreli’s Turing Pharmaceuticals, which raised the price of a generic cancer and AIDS drug from $13.50 a pill to $750. Mylan told CBS in a statement that EpiPen’s price “has changed over time to better reflect important product features and the value the product provides,” adding, “we’ve made a significant investment to support the device over the past years.” That investment might be little more than marketing. Nielsen figures show that Mylan spent $35.2 million on EpiPen commercials in 2014, up from $4.8 million in 2011. Bloomberg senior medical reporter Robert Langreth told CBS: “This brand name, EpiPen, it’s like Kleenex to allergists. You know, it’s a name they know and trust. It’s what they prescribe.” For better or for worse.

The latest potential acquisition in the space involves disease therapy specialist Medivation Inc (NASDAQ:MDVN), which is now rumored to be attracting takeover interest from at least five big pharma companies. According to a Reuters report, the suitors now include: Merck ($175B market cap), Sanofi ($101B market cap), Pfizer ($214B market cap), Celgene ($87B market cap), and and Gilead Sciences ($109B market cap). Merck was the newest addition to the list, said the source, who couldn’t provide more details because the discussion process is ongoing. The source indicated Medivation is also interested in speaking to even more possible buyers in what’s turning into an auction for the cancer drug maker. As expected, Medivation declined to comment. MDVN shares have risen 38.5% this year. Fellow biotech name Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB) is also attracting big takeover interest, and the fetching price could be huge. These and other M&A deals are greatly helping the Biotech ETF in its ongoing recovery from multiyear lows set earlier this year. The IBB was up $1.41 (+0.48%) to $292.31 in morning trading Thursday, and has pared its year-to-date losses down to -13.5%.

How can anyone think otherwise following his announcement that he wants to enlist "observers" to man the polls on election day, or Pence's assertion that, yes, "facilities" are required to process non-Muslim immigrants to make sure they aren't "compromised." Thugs? Camps? If you support Trump, I guess that's exactly what you want. Little word from the progressive left about this. They don't get outraged about Trump these days, too busy combusting about Bernie Sanders' summer house. I've seen more than one conspiratorial screed accusing Sanders of being paid off by the Democratic National Committee in the form of a summer house. Conspiracies are fun and exciting, but reality is mundane. The reality is that this was bought from the money the Sanders got from the sale of their Maine summer house, which had been in Jane Sanders' family since 1903 but they had, diabolically, never used much. They want something closer to home, so they sold it and directed that money to the Vermont house. Smoking gun! Conspiratorial progressives aren't getting upset about the "secret ledger" revealing millions of dollars in undisclosed payments to Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort from Ukrainian president and close Putin ally Viktor F. Yanukovych. There are even photos of the ledger in the New York Times. What makes progressive eyes literally pop out of their head are the released emails showing Clinton's advisers working to connect a Clinton Foundation contributor with the State Department. The meeting never happened, but the suggestion did. Is it troubling? Yes. Is it the same kind of troubling as thugs and camps and payoffs from Putin associates? In an ordinary election year, I wouldn't think so. But this is the kind of election year that someone like Jill Stein gets a lot of attention. Not investigative attention, more puff piece attention. Even the criticisms amount to puff criticisms, like the anti-vax allegations. This helps with the saintliness narrative that followers create. That's why you won't hear much about Stein's Federal Election Commission submission, which puts the anti-wealth candidate as being worth $3.9 million, according to the Center For Public Integrity. Does she have a summer house? I have no idea. The FEC papers also reveal the anti-Wall Street candidate owns stocks in Merck pharmaceutical, as well as Johnson & Johnson, Walt Disney, Home Depot. In the real world, this is known as hypocrisy. There's also the problem of her Russian connection. Stein met with Putin at a conference earlier this year — there are photos of them at a banquet table together. Stein took the opportunity criticize human rights in America. Fair enough, but she sadly doesn't lob the policy toward Russia, which is no friend to our LBGTQ friends. Stein has criticized the U.S. military actions in Syria, despite the destruction wrought by President Bashar Assad's forces and the Russians. And her running mate, human rights activist Ajamu Baraka, also has defended Assad vigorously. There are laws against being gay in Syria, subject to prison — if you make it that far alive, that is. Baraka is also associated with Holocaust denier Kevin Barrett, appearing on his radio show and in anthologies he has edited. Baraka is also a well-known 9-11 truther, the gold standard of 21st Century conspiracy theories. Stein is the only presidential candidate who gets as much positive airplay on RT as Trump. RT, a state-run Russian news network, recently ran a piece vigorously "debunking" the criticisms against Stein, which makes you wonder what stake the network has in the election. I'm sure it would love for Stein to take votes away from Clinton, since Trump is so successful at pushing votes away from himself. He needs all the help he can get. Russian media is willing.
