Read on... Achaogen Inc.'s (AKAO) lead product candidate Plazomicin, being developed for the treatment of serious bacterial infections due to MDR Enterobacteriaceae, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA. The Company intends to submit its New Drug Application for Plazomicin in the second half of 2017. In other news, Achaogen announced that it has commenced an underwritten public offering of up to 5 million shares of its common stock. AKAO closed Tuesday's trading at $26.08, up 3.57%. Merck's (MRK) blockbuster immunotherapy drug, Keytruda, has scored another FDA approval - this time for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic, microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient solid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options, or colorectal cancer that has progressed following treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. The above indication has been approved under accelerated approval program. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. Keytruda has already received FDA approval for the treatment of metastatic melanoma, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The drug brought home sales of $1.40 billion in 2016, up 148% compared to 2015. In related news, the Company announced that its Supplemental Biologics License Application for KEYTRUDA for treatment of recurrent or advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma has been granted priority review, with a decision date set for Sept. 22, 2017. MRK closed Tuesday's trading at $64.55, up 0.80%. Shares of Neurocrine Biosciences Inc. (NBIX) dropped more than 8% in extended trading on Tuesday, following disappointing results from its phase II study of Ingrezza for treatment of Tourette syndrome in pediatric population. Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurological disorder characterized by repetitive, stereotyped, involuntary movements and vocalizations called tics. (Source: NINDS). The study, dubbed T-Force GREEN, did not meet its primary endpoint of change-from-baseline between the placebo and active groups in the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) at Week 6 in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Ingrezza received FDA approval in the treatment of adults with tardive dyskinesia as recently as April of this year. Ingrezza is the first drug approved by the FDA for tardive dyskinesia. Tardive dyskinesia is a neurological disorder characterized by repetitive involuntary movements, usually of the jaw, lips and tongue, such as grimacing, sticking out the tongue and smacking the lips. The results from a phase II study of Ingrezza in adults with Tourette syndrome, which were reported in January, were also disappointing. The study, dubbed T-Forward , did show a significant improvement in overall symptoms of Tourette syndrome but failed to meet the pre-specified primary endpoint of change-from-baseline in the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale at Week 8. NBIX closed Tuesday's trading at $53.53, down 0.21%. In after-hours, the stock was down 8.09% to $49.20. Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals Inc. (SBPH) reported encouraging top-line results from the initial 25mg monotherapy dosing cohort of the Phase 2a segment of its ACHIEVE trial. The first segment of the ACHIEVE trial is a Phase 2a placebo-controlled, sequential-cohort, double-blind trial to evaluate increasing doses of SB 9200 as monotherapy for 12 weeks followed by Gilead Sciences Inc's Viread 300 mg for an additional 12 weeks. The primary endpoints for the Phase 2a trial are safety and antiviral activity, as measured by the change in HBV DNA at week 12 from baseline, with multiple exploratory secondary endpoints. According to the Company, overall, SB 9200 demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in HBV DNA at week 12 compared to placebo. The Company has begun enrollment in the second cohort (50 mg) of its phase 2a trial, and top-line results are anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Phase 2b segment of the ACHIEVE trial is designed to examine the concomitant use of SB 9200 and Viread in approximately 200 HBV patients. SBPH closed Tuesday's trading at $12.00, unchanged from the previous day's close. Shares of Syndax Pharmaceuticals Inc. (SNDX) plunged nearly 6% in extended trading on Tuesday, following a proposed public offering of its common stock. The Company is planning to offer and sell, subject to market and other conditions, $50 million of its common stock in the underwritten public offering. The underwriters have a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 15% of the number of shares sold in the public offering. Last week, the Company reported results from melanoma cohort of its ongoing phase II trial of Entinostat in combination with Merck's KEYTRUDA. The results showed that the addition of Entinostat can result in meaningful responses in patients who have progressed on an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 regimen like KEYTRUDA, which is an area of very high unmet medical need, according to the Company. SNDX closed Tuesday's trading at $14.67, up 0.41%. In after-hours, the stock was down 5.93% to $13.80. TG Therapeutics Inc.'s (TGTX) phase III trial of TG-1101 + TGR-1202 regimen in patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, dubbed UNITY-CLL, is expected to complete enrollment by this year end, which is earlier than planned. The Company expects to report pivotal Overall Response Rate (ORR) data from the trial in the third quarter of 2018. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) reviewed updated safety data from more than 270 patients in the trial, and finding no safety concerns, has recommended continuation of enrollment without modification. TGTX closed Tuesday's trading at $11.95, up 4.37%. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News The 10 Lowest-Paying College Majors Thrills and Chills: The 10 Most Fun States In America Dubai For Lunch?

In the first-line setting, Keytruda is now approved for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who are ineligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In the second-line setting, Keytruda is now approved for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. Keytruda is approved for use in these indications at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred with Keytruda including pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, and nephritis. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, Keytruda should be withheld or discontinued and corticosteroids administered if appropriate. Keytruda can also cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions; for Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue Keytruda (pembrolizumab). Based on its mechanism of action, Keytruda can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Female patients of reproductive potential should be advised of the potential hazard to a fetus. “Keytruda is now available for use as a first-line treatment option for patients with advanced urothelial bladder cancer who are not eligible for the standard of care, cisplatin-based chemotherapy,” said Dean F. Bajorin, M.D., study investigator and medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. “With the second-line indication, Keytruda also provides a new option for patients with advanced urothelial bladder cancer – and is the only anti-PD-1 therapy to show an overall survival benefit versus chemotherapy in a phase 3 study.” “These two indications mark important additions to the growing list of tumors and treatment settings for which Keytruda is now approved. This FDA approval further demonstrates Merck’s commitment to help improve the lives of patients with many types of advanced cancer,” said Dr. Roger M. Perlmutter, president, Merck Research Laboratories. The Keytruda clinical development program includes more than 30 tumor types in nearly 500 clinical trials, including more than 250 trials that combine Keytruda with other cancer treatments. Currently, Merck has the largest immuno-oncology clinical development program in bladder cancer, with 29 trials underway involving Keytruda as monotherapy and in combination, including four registration-enabling studies. Data Supporting First-Line Cisplatin-Ineligible Approval The first-line approval is based on data from a multicenter, open-label, single-arm trial, KEYNOTE-052, investigating Keytruda in 370 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who were not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. Patients with autoimmune disease or medical conditions that required systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medication were excluded from the trial. Patients received Keytruda at a dose of 200 mg every three weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression; patients without disease progression could be treated for up to 24 months. The major efficacy outcome measures were objective response rate (ORR), according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, as assessed by independent radiology review, and duration of response. The efficacy analysis showed an ORR of 29 percent (95% CI: 24, 34), with a complete response rate of 7 percent and a partial response rate of 22 percent. The median duration of response had not been reached (range: 1.4+ to 17.8+ months). The median follow-up time was 7.8 months. In KEYNOTE-052, Keytruda (pembrolizumab) was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 11 percent of patients. The most common adverse reactions (in ≥ 20% of patients) were fatigue (38%), musculoskeletal pain (24%), decreased appetite (22%), constipation (21%), rash (21%) and diarrhea (20%). Eighteen patients (5%) died from causes other than disease progression. Five patients (1.4%) who were treated with Keytruda experienced sepsis which led to death, and three patients (0.8%) experienced pneumonia which led to death. Adverse reactions leading to interruption of Keytruda occurred in 22 percent of patients; the most common (≥1%) were liver enzyme increase, diarrhea, urinary tract infection, acute kidney injury, fatigue, joint pain, and pneumonia. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 42 percent of patients, the most frequent (≥2%) of which were urinary tract infection, hematuria, acute kidney injury, pneumonia, and urosepsis. Data Supporting Second-Line Post-Platinum Failure Approval The second-line approval is based on data from a multicenter, randomized, active-controlled trial, KEYNOTE-045, investigating Keytruda in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were excluded from the trial. Patients were randomized to receive either Keytruda 200 mg every three weeks (n=270) or investigator’s choice of any of the following chemotherapy regimens, all given intravenously, every three weeks (n=272): paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 (n=84), docetaxel 75 mg/m2 (n=84), or vinflunine 320 mg/m2 (n=87). Treatment continued until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression; patients without disease progression could be treated for up to 24 months. The major efficacy outcomes were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed by a blinded independent central review (BICR) per RECIST 1.1; additional efficacy outcome measures were ORR, as assessed by BICR per RECIST 1.1, and duration of response. Keytruda demonstrated superior OS compared to chemotherapy. Findings demonstrated that Keytruda resulted in a 27 percent reduction in the risk of death compared to chemotherapy – with 155 events (57%) observed in the Keytruda arm, compared to 179 events (66%) in the chemotherapy arm (HR, 0.73 [95% CI: 0.59, 0.91], p=0.004); the median OS was 10.3 months (95% CI: 8.0, 11.8) in the Keytruda arm, compared to 7.4 months (95% CI: 6.1, 8.3) in the chemotherapy arm. In October 2016, the study was stopped early at the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee following an interim analysis that showed Keytruda met the superiority thresholds for OS in the overall study population. There was no statistically significant difference between Keytruda (pembrolizumab) and chemotherapy with respect to PFS. There were 218 events (81%) observed in the Keytruda arm, compared to 219 events (81%) in the chemotherapy arm (HR, 0.98 [95% CI: 0.81, 1.19], p=0.833). The median PFS was 2.1 months (95% CI: 2.0, 2.2) in the Keytruda arm, compared to 3.3 months (95% CI: 2.3, 3.5) in the chemotherapy arm. Analysis of the ORR endpoint showed a statistically significant improvement with Keytruda, as compared to chemotherapy. The ORR was 21 percent (95% CI: 16, 27) in the Keytruda arm (with a complete response rate of 7 percent and a partial response rate of 14 percent), compared to 11 percent (95% CI: 8, 16) in the chemotherapy arm (with a complete response rate of 3 percent and a partial response rate of 8 percent) (p=0.002). The median duration of response for patients treated with Keytruda had not yet been reached (range: 1.6+ to 15.6+ months), compared to 4.3 months (range: 1.4+ to 15.4+ months) in the chemotherapy arm. The median follow-up time for this trial was 9.0 months. In KEYNOTE-045, Keytruda was discontinued due to adverse reactions in eight percent of patients. The most common adverse reaction resulting in permanent discontinuation of Keytruda was pneumonitis (1.9%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of Keytruda occurred in 20 percent of patients; the most common (≥1%) were urinary tract infection (1.5%), diarrhea (1.5%), and colitis (1.1%). The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) in patients who received Keytruda versus those who received chemotherapy were fatigue (38% vs 56%), musculoskeletal pain (32% vs 27%), pruritus (23% vs 6%), decreased appetite (21% vs 21%), nausea (21% vs 29%) and rash (20% vs 13%). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 39 percent of Keytruda-treated patients, the most frequent (≥2%) of which were urinary tract infection, pneumonia, anemia, and pneumonitis. About Keytruda (pembrolizumab) Injection Keytruda is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. Keytruda is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. Studies of Keytruda – from the largest immuno-oncology program in the industry with nearly 500 trials – include a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The Keytruda clinical program seeks to understand factors that predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with Keytruda, including the exploration of several different biomarkers across a broad range of tumors. Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every three weeks for the approved indications. Keytruda for injection is supplied in a 100 mg single-dose vial. Our Focus on Cancer Our goal is to translate breakthrough science into innovative oncology medicines to help people with cancer worldwide. At Merck, helping people fight cancer is our passion and supporting accessibility to our cancer medicines is our commitment. Our focus is on pursuing research in immuno-oncology and we are accelerating every step in the journey – from lab to clinic – to potentially bring new hope to people with cancer. As part of our focus on cancer, Merck is committed to exploring the potential of immuno-oncology with one of the fastest-growing development programs in the industry. We are currently executing an expansive research program that includes nearly 500 clinical trials evaluating our anti-PD-1 therapy across more than 30 tumor types. We also continue to strengthen our immuno-oncology portfolio through strategic acquisitions and are prioritizing the development of several promising immunotherapeutic candidates with the potential to improve the treatment of advanced cancers.

Merck Sharp & Dohme is accused of abusing its dominant position by operating an unfair discount scheme for its medicine Remicade to restrict competition, the Competition and Markets Authority has claimed. Remicade, known generically as infliximab, is an antibody drug used to treat conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease.

Share this article Share The drug had been a big seller for Merck over the years but sales slipped in the face of competition from generics, falling 29 per cent last year to £978million. According to a source, Merck offered a discount to customers who continued to buy Remicade in the same quantities but not if they started buying generic alternatives, effectively encouraging buyers not to switch. Merck said it is 'cooperating fully with the CMA's ongoing investigation' and is confident that the proceedings will show it has complied with competition law at all times.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Tuesday it had provisionally found the U.S. company's European unit, Merck Sharp & Dohme, had abused its dominant position through the scheme, opening it up to potential financial penalties. MSD said it did not believe it had broken competition rules. Remicade, known generically as infliximab, is an antibody drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. The drug is proving an important test for the emerging biosimilars industry. It was the first antibody drug for which copycat versions were approved by European regulators, leading to the launch of discounted products from biosimilar drugmakers including South Korea's Celltrion, which works with Pfizer. One person familiar with the investigation said MSD offered a discount to customers who continued to buy Remicade in the same quantities but not if they started buying biosimilars, which amounted to an incentive not to switch. Remicade has been a big seller for Merck over the years but sales have been falling in the face of biosimilar competition, declining 29 percent last year to $1.27 billion. Merck sells the drug in Europe, while Johnson & Johnson markets it in the United States. Such biotech drugs are made inside living cells so it is impossible to make exact generic copies, as happens with simple pills. Instead, regulators have come up with the notion of approving products that are "similar" enough to do the same job. Manufacturing and developing biosimilars requires considerable expertise and is relatively costly, but the field is attracting growing investment as multiple blockbuster biotech medicines start to go off patent. CANCER DRUGS NEXT This year has seen the launch in Europe of the first biosimilar copy of an antibody drug for cancer, opening up a major new disease area to cut-price competition. The CMA, which opened its investigation in December 2015, said it proposed to find MSD and its parent Merck & Co jointly and severally liable for the alleged infringement. The competition regulator can fine companies up to 10 percent of their global turnover if they are found to have breached competition law, although a CMA spokesman emphasised this was a ceiling rather than a guideline for penalties. MSD said it was cooperating fully with the CMA, adding it was confident the proceedings would show it had complied with the law. It argued that the discounts in question meant infliximab was competitively priced and offered savings to the UK National Health Service, without hindering competition. Tuesday's statement of objections from the CMA sets out its provisional views and does not mean there has in fact been any breach of competition law. "The CMA will carefully consider any representations by the company under investigation before determining whether the law has been infringed," it said in a statement. The CMA has been increasingly active in pharmaceuticals. In December last year, it fined Pfizer a record 84.2 million pounds ($109 million) for its role in ramping up the cost of an epilepsy drug. In February 2016, it fined GlaxoSmithKline 37.6 million pounds over deals delaying the launch of generic copies of its antidepressant Seroxat.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 23 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman FDA Approves Merck’s KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) for Adult and Pediatric Patients with Unresectable or Metastatic, Microsatellite Instability-High (MSI-H) or Mismatch Repair Deficient Cancer KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a new indication for KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), the company’s anti-PD-1 therapy. KEYTRUDA is now indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic, microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient solid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options, or colorectal cancer that has progressed following treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. The safety and effectiveness of KEYTRUDA in pediatric patients with MSI-H central nervous system cancers have not been established. The recommended dose of KEYTRUDA in adults is 200 mg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. In children, the recommended dose of KEYTRUDA is 2 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 200 mg) administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred with KEYTRUDA including pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, and nephritis. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) should be withheld or discontinued and corticosteroids administered if appropriate. KEYTRUDA can also cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions; for Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Female patients of reproductive potential should be advised of the potential hazard to a fetus. For more information regarding immune-mediated adverse reactions, please read the additional Selected Safety Information below. “The FDA’s approval of this new indication for KEYTRUDA further supports Merck’s commitment to helping people with difficult-to-treat cancers,” said Dr. Roger M. Perlmutter, president, Merck Research Laboratories. “We are thankful to the researchers, as well as the patients and their families who helped make today’s approval possible.” Further details will be included in a news release to follow. Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Injection 100 mg KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 94 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%) pneumonitis, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (6.9%) compared to those without (2.9%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 48 (1.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) colitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 19 (0.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%) hepatitis. Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) can cause hypophysitis. Hypophysitis occurred in 17 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%) hypophysitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency). Administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. KEYTRUDA can cause thyroid disorders, including hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and thyroiditis. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 96 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%) hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism occurred in 237 (8.5%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%) hypothyroidism. Thyroiditis occurred in 16 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%) thyroiditis. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. Administer replacement hormones for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. KEYTRUDA can cause type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 9 (0.3%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis. KEYTRUDA can cause other clinically important immune-mediated adverse reactions. These immune-mediated reactions may involve any organ system. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction. The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), exfoliative dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid, rash (1.4%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, and partial seizures arising in a patient with inflammatory foci in brain parenchyma. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and postmarketing use. Solid organ transplant rejection has been reported in postmarketing use of KEYTRUDA. Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider benefit of treatment with KEYTRUDA vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients. KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions, including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of KEYTRUDA. Most common adverse reactions (reported in ≥20% of patients) were fatigue, pruritus, diarrhea, decreased appetite, rash, pyrexia, cough, dyspnea, musculoskeletal pain, constipation, and nausea. It is not known whether KEYTRUDA is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, instruct women to discontinue nursing during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the final dose.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 23 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman FDA Grants Priority Review to Merck’s Supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) for Treatment of Recurrent or Advanced Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for review a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), the company’s anti-PD-1 therapy, seeking approval for treatment of patients with recurrent or advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have already received two or more lines of chemotherapy. The FDA granted Priority Review with a PDUFA, or target action, date of Sept. 22, 2017. “An estimated nearly one-hundred-thousand people are living with gastric cancer in the U.S., yet little progress has been made in bringing forward new treatment options to these patients for whom chemotherapy has long been the standard of care,” said Dr. Roger Dansey, senior vice president and therapeutic area head, oncology late-stage development, Merck Research Laboratories. “We look forward to working with the FDA to bring KEYTRUDA to people with gastric cancer who have progressed after receiving chemotherapy and are in urgent need of another option.” The application submitted to the FDA is seeking approval for KEYTRUDA monotherapy in previously treated patients at a fixed dose of 200 mg administered intravenously every three weeks. The application is based on data from cohort one of the phase 2 KEYNOTE-059 trial investigating KEYTRUDA in heavily pretreated patients with recurrent or advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma that has progressed after two or more lines of chemotherapy. Data from cohort one of KEYNOTE-059 will be presented at the 53rd Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in Chicago, June 2 – 6, 2017 during an oral session on Sunday, June 4 at 9:00 a.m. – 9:12 a.m. CDT (Location: Hall D2). Merck is committed to investigating new approaches across the spectrum of cancers with more than 500 clinical trials evaluating KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) in more than 30 tumor types, including multiple gastrointestinal cancers like gastric cancer. Specific to gastric cancer, Merck’s broad clinical development program encompasses all stages of advanced disease and is investigating KEYTRUDA as monotherapy and in combination with other cancer treatments across multiple lines of therapy. To date, the program includes four gastric cancer registration-enabling studies and numerous other gastrointestinal cancer studies are underway. About Gastric Cancer Gastric cancer, also called stomach cancer, is a type of cancer that begins in the stomach and tends to develop slowly over many years. Most gastric cancers are adenocarcinomas, which develop from the cells of the innermost lining (mucosa) of the stomach. Risk factors for gastric cancer include gender, age, ethnicity, geography and infection with Helicobacter pylori. Worldwide, gastric cancer is the fifth most common type of cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death. Each year there are approximately 952,000 newly diagnosed cases of gastric cancer resulting in approximately 723,000 deaths worldwide. It is estimated that in 2017, more than 10,000 people will die from gastric cancer in the U.S. alone. About KEYTRUDA ®(pembrolizumab) Injection KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. Studies of KEYTRUDA – from the largest immuno-oncology program in the industry with more than 500 trials – include a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand factors that predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including the exploration of several different biomarkers across a broad range of tumors. KEYTRUDA is administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every three weeks for the approved indications. KEYTRUDA for injection is supplied in a 100 mg single-dose vial. KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) Indications and Dosing Melanoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Lung Cancer KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥50%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is also indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and progression-free survival. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In metastatic NSCLC, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. When administering KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy, KEYTRUDA should be administered prior to chemotherapy when given on the same day. See also the Prescribing Information for pemetrexed and carboplatin. Head and Neck Cancer KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In HNSCC, KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), or who have relapsed after three or more prior lines of therapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In adults with cHL, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. In pediatric patients with cHL, KEYTRUDA is administered at a dose of 2 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 200 mg) every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Urothelial Carcinoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. KEYTRUDA is also indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. In locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA ®  (pembrolizumab) KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 94 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%) pneumonitis, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (6.9%) compared to those without (2.9%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 48 (1.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) colitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 19 (0.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%) hepatitis. Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis. Hypophysitis occurred in 17 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%) hypophysitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency). Administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. KEYTRUDA can cause thyroid disorders, including hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and thyroiditis. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 96 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%) hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism occurred in 237 (8.5%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%) hypothyroidism. Thyroiditis occurred in 16 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%) thyroiditis. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. Administer replacement hormones for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. KEYTRUDA can cause type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia. KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 9 (0.3%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis. KEYTRUDA can cause other clinically important immune-mediated adverse reactions. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction. The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), exfoliative dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid, rash (1.4%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, and partial seizures arising in a patient with inflammatory foci in brain parenchyma. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and postmarketing use. Solid organ transplant rejection has been reported in postmarketing use of KEYTRUDA. Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider benefit of treatment with KEYTRUDA vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients. KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions, including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after being treated with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA on any trial, 6 patients (26%) developed graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), one of which was fatal, and 2 patients (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning, one of which was fatal. Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody before transplantation. These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute GVHD, severe (Grade 3 to 4) acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic VOD, and other immune-mediated adverse reactions, and intervene promptly. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of KEYTRUDA. In KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) occurred in 21% of patients; the most common (≥1%) was diarrhea (2.5%). The most common adverse reactions with KEYTRUDA vs ipilimumab were fatigue (28% vs 28%), diarrhea (26% with KEYTRUDA), rash (24% vs 23%), and nausea (21% with KEYTRUDA).

The study was not designed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in adverse reaction rates for KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy, as compared to chemotherapy alone, for any specified adverse reaction. KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 17% of 192 patients with HNSCC. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 45% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients were pneumonia, dyspnea, confusional state, vomiting, pleural effusion, and respiratory failure. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) were fatigue, decreased appetite, and dyspnea. Adverse reactions occurring in patients with HNSCC were generally similar to those occurring in patients with melanoma or NSCLC, with the exception of increased incidences of facial edema (10% all Grades; 2.1% Grades 3 or 4) and new or worsening hypothyroidism. KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 5% of 210 patients with cHL, and treatment was interrupted due to adverse reactions in 26% of patients.

The most common adverse reactions (occurring in ≥20% of patients) were fatigue (26%), pyrexia (24%), cough (24%), musculoskeletal pain (21%), diarrhea (20%), and rash (20%). In KEYNOTE-052, KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 11% of 370 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. The most common adverse reactions (in ≥20% of patients) were fatigue (38%), musculoskeletal pain (24%), decreased appetite (22%), constipation (21%), rash (21%), and diarrhea (20%). Eighteen patients (5%) died from causes other than disease progression. Five patients (1.4%) who were treated with KEYTRUDA experienced sepsis which led to death, and 3 patients (0.8%) experienced pneumonia which led to death. Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 22% of patients; the most common (≥1%) were liver enzyme increase, diarrhea, urinary tract infection, acute kidney injury, fatigue, joint pain, and pneumonia. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 42% of patients, the most frequent (≥2%) of which were urinary tract infection, hematuria, acute kidney injury, pneumonia, and urosepsis. In KEYNOTE-045, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 8% of 266 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. The most common adverse reaction resulting in permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA was pneumonitis (1.9%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 20% of patients; the most common (≥1%) were urinary tract infection (1.5%), diarrhea (1.5%), and colitis (1.1%).

Serious adverse reactions occurred in 39% of KEYTRUDA-treated patients, the most frequent (≥2%) of which were urinary tract infection, pneumonia, anemia, and pneumonitis. It is not known whether KEYTRUDA is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, instruct women to discontinue nursing during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the final dose. There is limited experience in pediatric patients. In a study of 40 pediatric patients with advanced melanoma, PD-L1–positive advanced, relapsed, or refractory solid tumors or lymphoma, patients were treated with KEYTRUDA for a median of 43 days (range 1 to 414 days), with 24 patients (60%) receiving treatment for 42 days or more. The safety profile in pediatric patients was similar to that seen in adults treated with KEYTRUDA. Toxicities that occurred at a higher rate (≥15% difference) in these patients when compared to adults under 65 years of age were fatigue (45%), vomiting (38%), abdominal pain (28%), hypertransaminasemia (28%), and hyponatremia (18%).

Zurück Merck 23.05.2017 - 17:34 Uhr - Michel Doepke - Volontär Merck & Co: Blockbuster Keytruda setzt neue Maßstäbe in der Krebsmedizin Es ist unumstritten: Große Pharma-Konzerne suchen neue Blockbuster, um den Umsatzschwund durch auslaufende Patente zu kompensieren. Merck & Co aus den USA hat mit dem Krebsmittel Keytruda ein solches Ass im Ärmel. Im September 2014 erhielt die Firma die US-Zulassung für das Präparat. Weitere Zulassungen in anderen Indikationen werden folgen und Merck Co auf Kurs halten. Wachstumsmotor Keytruda Im letzten Quartal konnte sich Merck Co einmal mehr auf den Blockbuster verlassen: Die Umsätze stiegen um satte 134 Prozent auf 584 Millionen Dollar im Quartal. Die Folge: Sowohl Ergebnis- als auch Umsatzschätzungen geschlagen. On top gab es eine Prognoseerhöhung für das laufende Jahr. Auch wenn Analysten mit Keytruda-Erlösen von 615 Millionen Dollar rechneten, geschenkt. Denn Merck & Co treibt die klinische Entwicklung in weiteren Indikationen sukzessive voran – mit Erfolg. So erhielt der Dow-Jones-Titel vor kurzem den Priority-Review-Status von der amerikanischen Zulassungsbehörde FDA für eine Keytruda-Indikation bei Magen- beziehungsweise Speiseröhrenkrebs. Zudem plant Merck & Co mit Keytruda eine weitere klinische Studie zusammen mit Aduro Biotechs Präparat CRS-207. Dass der Blockbuster in Kombi-Therapien noch besser wirkt, zeigten vor kurzem die vielversprechenden Studiendaten mit Incytes Epacadostat. Die Kombi-Immuntherapie zeigte, dass 14 von 40 Patienten (35 Prozent) mit nicht-kleinzelligem Lungenkrebs gut auf die Behandlung ansprachen und der Tumor um mindestens 30 Prozent schrumpfte. Eine Therapie nur mit Keytruda zeigte eine Erfolgsrate von lediglich 18 bis 20 Prozent. Das heißt, dass das Potenzial von Keytruda noch lange nicht ausgeschöpft ist. 2018 sollen bereits Umsätz von über sechs Milliarden Dollar erzielt werden. Mit Keytruda stark in der Krebsmedizin Gerade die Kombi-Therapien mit Keytruda versprechen ein enormes Umsatzpotenzial. Zudem kann die Behandlung in Zukunft auf weitere Krebsarten ausgeweitet werden. Aktuell fehlen der Aktie von Merck & Co einfach die Impulse. Potentielle Neueinsteiger sollten vor einem Einstieg klare Kaufsignale abwarten.   Artikel kommentieren: Um einen Kommentar zu schreiben, müssen Sie eingeloggt sein. Sie besitzen noch kein Login?

Competition authorities hit MSD, as Merck & Co is known outside the US, with formal charges that could lead to fines of tens of millions of pounds. MSD allegedly attempted to prevent NHS doctors from using rival suppliers of a drug called infliximab, which it sells under the brand name Remicade, after its patent expired in 2015. Infliximab is an antibody that suppresses part of the immune system and is used worldwide to treat a range of inflammatory conditions, including Crohn’s disease and psoriasis, as well as arthritis. About 100,000 NHS patients are treated with it at a cost of approximately £150m per year. The drug is made by culturing genetically engineered cells. This complex process makes it difficult for MSD’s new rivals to produce versions identical to Remicade. Instead they produce so-called biosimilar treatments which are close facsimilies. Doctors have been cautious about switching to biosimilar infliximab, however, fearing the effect on treatment of any tiny changes. MSD allegedly exploited this caution by offering a discount on Remicade that would be withdrawn from buyers who tried alternatives. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had provisionally found that the discount scheme was a breach of competition law, “likely to restrict competition from biosimilar versions of infliximab that were new to the market”. The watchdog issued a statement of objections to the company, a major step towards potentially heavy fines. The CMA has the power to issue fines of up to 10pc of global turnover, which for Merck & Co would mean a maximum of more than £3bn. In practice, in similar cases the penalty has been in the tens of millions of pounds. MSD, which denies the allegations, will have a chance to respond before any punishment is delivered. A spokesman for the company said: “MSD is confident that the proceedings will show that MSD has complied with competition law at all times. “The discounts in question meant that infliximab was competitively priced and offered savings to the UK NHS, without hindering competition.” The charges are the latest move in a wider crackdown on medicine pricing by the CMA. In March it accused two drug makers of collaborating to restrict competition in the market for the steroid hydrocortisone. Last year Pfizer was fined a record £84m for abusing its dominance of the market for an anti-epilepsy drug to hike prices by up to 27 times.

(WDRB) -- Metropolitan Sewer District customers could soon face a rate hike.  MSD approved a preliminary rate hike to pay for its operating budget along with a multi-billion dollar long-term plan to repair and upgrade the Louisville/Jefferson County sewer system. Metro Council must give final approval of the plan.  The rate increase will fund a 20-year, $4.3 billion Critical Repair and Reinvestment Plan (CRRP), which MSD says is necessary to protect the public health and safety of residents and businesses. It will raise the average monthly residential bill by about $10.49 based on usage of 5,000 a month. The CRRP will upgrade and expand the sewage system across the entire service area.  MSD says repairs are overdue for Louisville's aging system of pipes, pumps, treatment plants and flood gates. It says serious failures are occurring more often especially during heavy rainfall and storms.  MSD says it has invested more than $400 million over the past decade to comply with a federal Consent Decree meant to reduce sewer overflows. An estimated $500 million of work is still necessary to reach the mandatory completion by December 2024. MSD Director Tony Parrott says in a statement that they do not take the decision lightly.  He acknowledged the impact that even a slight increase can have on lower income residents and seniors.  He says the budget plan also includes a new Wastewater Rate Assistance Program (WRAP) designed to assist eligible customers with the cost of service. Public input from meetings and social media resulted in an expansion of a rate relief program for senior citizens. The assistance program will be administered by the Metro Community Services Department.  It will follow the current guidelines as the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program or LIHEAP program. MSD says its infrastructure reinvestment will have an economic impact in Louisville of $3.4 billion and sustain 2,310 jobs/yr.over the next 10 years.  ?Copyright 2017 WDRB Media. All Rights Reserved.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 23 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman New Data from Emulate’s Asthma-on-Chip Presented at American Thoracic Society Annual Meeting BOSTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Emulate Inc. presented data today that shows expanded functionality in modeling viral infection on the Small Airway Lung-Chip. This advancement opens new opportunities for studying viral-induced exacerbations of asthma using a human-relevant system. The data demonstrates the capability to model human airway tissue on the Small Airway Lung-Chip and to reproduce infection with a virus in vitro — recreating viral-induced exacerbation commonly experienced by asthma patients. The studies in the Small Airway Lung-Chip were carried out as part of a collaborative project between Emulate and Merck, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada. The results of this collaborative research enable advanced human-relevant model systems that can lead to a better understanding of how viral infection worsens asthma symptoms, providing insights for developing new anti-inflammatory treatments, specifically for asthma. The research was presented at the American Thoracic Society annual meeting in Washington, DC, and showed: Recreation of airway tissue interfaces of the lung’s small airway, with differentiated mucociliary bronchiolar airway epithelium underlined by a microvascular endothelium which experiences fluid flow; Induction of a pro-inflammatory response characterized by cell death, goblet cells hyperplasia, and release of cytokines, when the Small Airway Lung-Chip was infected with human Rhinovirus (HRV), a leading cause of asthma exacerbation in children and adults; Effective modeling of molecular responses observed in severe asthma by showing altered interferon response and recruitment of circulating human neutrophils (immune cells); Pharmacological modulation of neutrophil recruitment by demonstrating that neutrophils, which drive innate inflammatory cell infiltration to the lungs in viral-induced asthma exacerbations, can be modulated by a selective CXCR2 antagonist drug agent. “It has been a remarkable process for us to work with a leading pharmaceutical collaborator such as Merck, and our joint research has resulted in further advancing the capabilities of the Small Airway Lung-Chip,” said Geraldine A. Hamilton, Ph.D., President and Chief Scientific Officer of Emulate. “Our Lung-Chip has now achieved new levels of functionality to more accurately recreate human biology for airway inflammation and respiratory disease applications. We are excited to continue to apply the Small Airway Lung-Chip to potentially accelerate the discovery and development of better and safer drugs for patients with challenging inflammatory diseases of the lung, such as COPD, asthma, and respiratory infections.” Emulate and Merck have a multi-year research collaboration to deploy Emulate’s Organs-on-Chips technology for drug discovery and development applications, including development of more human-relevant systems to model inflammatory diseases and to better predict the potential human response of therapeutic candidates. The research collaboration focuses on using Emulate’s Small Airway Lung-Chip and Intestine-Chip for modeling inflammatory processes in the human lung and the gastrointestinal system. Current animal models for these applications can be limited in their relevance to humans in that their physiology can be distinctively different from the human, and the mechanisms driving key disease process can show marked species differences. About The Lung-Chip Emulate has developed Lung-Chip systems that recreate true-to-life functions of the human lung. Due to the distinct structure and biology of different parts of the lung and their differentiated role in disease processes, Emulate has developed a range of Lung-Chips that enable human-relevant research related to lung diseases and various aspects of lung biology. The Alveolar Lung-Chip emulates the fundamental lung functions such as oxygen-exchange and absorption in the breathing human lung and has been used in a range of applications, including evaluation of nanoparticle absorption and toxicity, study of disease development and assessment of adverse drug effects, such as pulmonary edema and pulmonary thrombosis. The Small Airway Lung-Chip models a different aspect of lung biology, distinct from the alveolar air sacs. It recapitulates the physiology and function of the airway epithelium that conduct inhaled air to the alveolar air sacs, and Emulate has demonstrated that the Small Airway Lung-Chip models inflammation and therapeutic responses in human small airway diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). About the “Human Emulation System” Powered by Organs-On-Chips Technology Based on the Organs-on-Chips technology, Emulate has created a new living Human Emulation System™ that provides a real-time window into the inner workings of human biology and disease – offering researchers a new technology designed to predict human response with greater precision and detail than today’s cell culture or animal-based experimental testing. Each of Emulate’s proprietary Organ-Chips – such as the lung, liver, brain, intestine or kidney – contains tiny hollow channels lined with tens of thousands of living human cells and tissues, and is approximately the size of an AA battery. An Organ-Chip is a living, micro-engineered environment that recreates the natural physiology and mechanical forces that cells experience within the human body. About Emulate, Inc. Emulate Inc. is a privately held company that creates living products for understanding how diseases, medicines, chemicals, and foods affect human health. Our Human Emulation System™ sets a new standard for recreating true-to-life human biology and is being used to advance product innovation, design, and safety across a range of applications including drug development, agriculture, cosmetics, food, and chemical-based consumer products. Emulate continues to develop a wide range of Organ-Chips and disease models through collaborations with industry partners and internal R&D programs.

We are excited to continue to apply the Small Airway Lung-Chip to potentially accelerate the discovery and development of better and safer drugs for patients with challenging inflammatory diseases of the lung, such as COPD, asthma, and respiratory infections.” Emulate and Merck have a multi-year research collaboration to deploy Emulate’s Organs-on-Chips technology for drug discovery and development applications, including development of more human-relevant systems to model inflammatory diseases and to better predict the potential human response of therapeutic candidates. The research collaboration focuses on using Emulate’s Small Airway Lung-Chip and Intestine-Chip for modeling inflammatory processes in the human lung and the gastrointestinal system. Current animal models for these applications can be limited in their relevance to humans in that their physiology can be distinctively different from the human, and the mechanisms driving key disease process can show marked species differences. About The Lung-Chip Emulate has developed Lung-Chip systems that recreate true-to-life functions of the human lung. Due to the distinct structure and biology of different parts of the lung and their differentiated role in disease processes, Emulate has developed a range of Lung-Chips that enable human-relevant research related to lung diseases and various aspects of lung biology. The Alveolar Lung-Chip emulates the fundamental lung functions such as oxygen-exchange and absorption in the breathing human lung and has been used in a range of applications, including evaluation of nanoparticle absorption and toxicity, study of disease development and assessment of adverse drug effects, such as pulmonary edema and pulmonary thrombosis. The Small Airway Lung-Chip models a different aspect of lung biology, distinct from the alveolar air sacs. It recapitulates the physiology and function of the airway epithelium that conduct inhaled air to the alveolar air sacs, and Emulate has demonstrated that the Small Airway Lung-Chip models inflammation and therapeutic responses in human small airway diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). About the “Human Emulation System” Powered by Organs-On-Chips Technology Based on the Organs-on-Chips technology, Emulate has created a new living Human Emulation System™ that provides a real-time window into the inner workings of human biology and disease – offering researchers a new technology designed to predict human response with greater precision and detail than today’s cell culture or animal-based experimental testing.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 23 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman New Data from Emulate’s Asthma-on-Chip Presented at American Thoracic Society Annual Meeting BOSTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Emulate Inc. presented data today that shows expanded functionality in modeling viral infection on the Small Airway Lung-Chip. This advancement opens new opportunities for studying viral-induced exacerbations of asthma using a human-relevant system. The data demonstrates the capability to model human airway tissue on the Small Airway Lung-Chip and to reproduce infection with a virus in vitro — recreating viral-induced exacerbation commonly experienced by asthma patients. The studies in the Small Airway Lung-Chip were carried out as part of a collaborative project between Emulate and Merck, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada. The results of this collaborative research enable advanced human-relevant model systems that can lead to a better understanding of how viral infection worsens asthma symptoms, providing insights for developing new anti-inflammatory treatments, specifically for asthma.

This first edition, which is open to professionals, students and young entrepreneurs, will take place on the 23rd of May 2017 from 9 am to 7 pm at Pavilion Soukra Valley Tunis. The eHealth Meetup was initiated by Merck Accelerator Africa in April 2016 in Nairobi. After its successful launch in Johannesburg in November, Merck NWA is now bringing the eHealth Meetup to Tunis. While exploring the dialogue between technology and education, the Meetup will include talks from prominent entrepreneurs about their contribution to the discussion, both hopes and fears for a changing continent. The main objective of the event is to set up a forum for business leaders, entrepreneurs, policy-makers, scholars and aspiring entrepreneurs to gather and exchange ideas around entrepreneurship. The conference strives to provide meaningful coverage on current trends in the dynamic economies of Africa as well as leveraging experience from around the globe to create a thriving African Start-up community. Dr. Karim Bendhaou, General Manager of Merck NWA, explains: “We are very proud to host the first eHealth initiative in Tunisia that will provide a platform for African start-ups to learn about eHealth opportunities and grow internationally. Merck is dedicated to support young talents in the digital field and we are working towards building a strong ecosystem by merging efforts with regional players. Building an incubator will be a first step for us to achieve these goals.” The event will be attended by various panellists and speakers as well as foreign investors. Participants will explore the unique challenges, advantages and lessons gained from business experience. Several contestants will take the stage to pitch an original business idea to a panel of judges from the business community and an audience of other entrepreneurs, small business owners, potential investors, students, business and community leaders, and professionals. This event will also see the announcement of an Incubator headed by Merck NWA in order to: * Train young professionals and students on entrepreneurship and build mixed teams to attack their mother markets as a first step * Help successful teams to raise money and build their go to market strategy * Build a network of supporting partners: VC funds, start-up incubators, mentors… With its work with digital start-ups on the African continent, Merck is empowering young entrepreneurs and continuously identifying new innovative solutions.

According to the Competition and Markets Authority’s provisional findings released on Tuesday, one of the US company’s European units - Merck Sharp & Dohme - abused its dominant market position through a discount scheme for the drug Remicade – generically known as infliximab – which is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease. "The CMA has provisionally found that MSD broke competition law by abusing its dominant position through a discount scheme for Remicade that was likely to restrict competition from 'biosimilar' versions of infliximab that were new to the market," the competition watchdog said in a statement.

Remicade is a key drug for Merck, even though sales declined 29 per cent last year to $1.27bn (£980m). Merck has offices in 140 countries, including a UK headquarters at Hoddesdon in Hertfordshire.

MSD told Reuters it was cooperating fully with the watchdog, adding it was confident the proceedings would show it had complied with the  law.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 23 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman FDA Grants Priority Review to Merck’s Supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) for Treatment of Recurrent or Advanced Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for review a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), the company’s anti-PD-1 therapy, seeking approval for treatment of patients with recurrent or advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have already received two or more lines of chemotherapy. The FDA granted Priority Review with a PDUFA, or target action, date of Sept. 22, 2017. “An estimated nearly one-hundred-thousand people are living with gastric cancer in the U.S., yet little progress has been made in bringing forward new treatment options to these patients for whom chemotherapy has long been the standard of care,” said Dr. Roger Dansey, senior vice president and therapeutic area head, oncology late-stage development, Merck Research Laboratories. “We look forward to working with the FDA to bring KEYTRUDA to people with gastric cancer who have progressed after receiving chemotherapy and are in urgent need of another option.” The application submitted to the FDA is seeking approval for KEYTRUDA monotherapy in previously treated patients at a fixed dose of 200 mg administered intravenously every three weeks. The application is based on data from cohort one of the phase 2 KEYNOTE-059 trial investigating KEYTRUDA in heavily pretreated patients with recurrent or advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma that has progressed after two or more lines of chemotherapy. Data from cohort one of KEYNOTE-059 will be presented at the 53rd Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in Chicago, June 2 – 6, 2017 during an oral session on Sunday, June 4 at 9:00 a.m. – 9:12 a.m. CDT (Location: Hall D2). Merck is committed to investigating new approaches across the spectrum of cancers with more than 500 clinical trials evaluating KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) in more than 30 tumor types, including multiple gastrointestinal cancers like gastric cancer. Specific to gastric cancer, Merck’s broad clinical development program encompasses all stages of advanced disease and is investigating KEYTRUDA as monotherapy and in combination with other cancer treatments across multiple lines of therapy. To date, the program includes four gastric cancer registration-enabling studies and numerous other gastrointestinal cancer studies are underway. About Gastric Cancer Gastric cancer, also called stomach cancer, is a type of cancer that begins in the stomach and tends to develop slowly over many years. Most gastric cancers are adenocarcinomas, which develop from the cells of the innermost lining (mucosa) of the stomach. Risk factors for gastric cancer include gender, age, ethnicity, geography and infection with Helicobacter pylori. Worldwide, gastric cancer is the fifth most common type of cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death. Each year there are approximately 952,000 newly diagnosed cases of gastric cancer resulting in approximately 723,000 deaths worldwide. It is estimated that in 2017, more than 10,000 people will die from gastric cancer in the U.S. alone. About KEYTRUDA®(pembrolizumab) Injection KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. Studies of KEYTRUDA – from the largest immuno-oncology program in the industry with more than 500 trials – include a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand factors that predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including the exploration of several different biomarkers across a broad range of tumors. KEYTRUDA is administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every three weeks for the approved indications. KEYTRUDA for injection is supplied in a 100 mg single-dose vial. KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) Indications and Dosing Melanoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Lung Cancer KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥50%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is also indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and progression-free survival. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In metastatic NSCLC, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. When administering KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy, KEYTRUDA should be administered prior to chemotherapy when given on the same day. See also the Prescribing Information for pemetrexed and carboplatin. Head and Neck Cancer KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In HNSCC, KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), or who have relapsed after three or more prior lines of therapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In adults with cHL, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. In pediatric patients with cHL, KEYTRUDA is administered at a dose of 2 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 200 mg) every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Urothelial Carcinoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. KEYTRUDA is also indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. In locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 94 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%) pneumonitis, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (6.9%) compared to those without (2.9%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 48 (1.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) colitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 19 (0.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%) hepatitis. Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis. Hypophysitis occurred in 17 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%) hypophysitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency). Administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. KEYTRUDA can cause thyroid disorders, including hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and thyroiditis. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 96 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%) hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism occurred in 237 (8.5%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%) hypothyroidism. Thyroiditis occurred in 16 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%) thyroiditis. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. Administer replacement hormones for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. KEYTRUDA can cause type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia. KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 9 (0.3%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis. KEYTRUDA can cause other clinically important immune-mediated adverse reactions. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction. The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), exfoliative dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid, rash (1.4%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, and partial seizures arising in a patient with inflammatory foci in brain parenchyma. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and postmarketing use. Solid organ transplant rejection has been reported in postmarketing use of KEYTRUDA. Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider benefit of treatment with KEYTRUDA vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients. KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions, including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after being treated with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA on any trial, 6 patients (26%) developed graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), one of which was fatal, and 2 patients (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning, one of which was fatal. Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody before transplantation. These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute GVHD, severe (Grade 3 to 4) acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic VOD, and other immune-mediated adverse reactions, and intervene promptly. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of KEYTRUDA. In KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) occurred in 21% of patients; the most common (≥1%) was diarrhea (2.5%). The most common adverse reactions with KEYTRUDA vs ipilimumab were fatigue (28% vs 28%), diarrhea (26% with KEYTRUDA), rash (24% vs 23%), and nausea (21% with KEYTRUDA). Corresponding incidence rates are listed for ipilimumab only for those adverse reactions that occurred at the same or lower rate than with KEYTRUDA. In KEYNOTE-002, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 12% of 357 patients with advanced melanoma; the most common (≥1%) were general physical health deterioration (1%), asthenia (1%), dyspnea (1%), pneumonitis (1%), and generalized edema (1%).

The study was not designed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in adverse reaction rates for KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy, as compared to chemotherapy alone, for any specified adverse reaction. KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 17% of 192 patients with HNSCC. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 45% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients were pneumonia, dyspnea, confusional state, vomiting, pleural effusion, and respiratory failure. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) were fatigue, decreased appetite, and dyspnea. Adverse reactions occurring in patients with HNSCC were generally similar to those occurring in patients with melanoma or NSCLC, with the exception of increased incidences of facial edema (10% all Grades; 2.1% Grades 3 or 4) and new or worsening hypothyroidism. KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 5% of 210 patients with cHL, and treatment was interrupted due to adverse reactions in 26% of patients. Fifteen percent (15%) of patients had an adverse reaction requiring systemic corticosteroid therapy. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 16% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (≥1%) included pneumonia, pneumonitis, pyrexia, dyspnea, GVHD, and herpes zoster. Two patients died from causes other than disease progression; one from GVHD after subsequent allogeneic HSCT and one from septic shock. The most common adverse reactions (occurring in ≥20% of patients) were fatigue (26%), pyrexia (24%), cough (24%), musculoskeletal pain (21%), diarrhea (20%), and rash (20%). In KEYNOTE-052, KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 11% of 370 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. The most common adverse reactions (in ≥20% of patients) were fatigue (38%), musculoskeletal pain (24%), decreased appetite (22%), constipation (21%), rash (21%), and diarrhea (20%). Eighteen patients (5%) died from causes other than disease progression. Five patients (1.4%) who were treated with KEYTRUDA experienced sepsis which led to death, and 3 patients (0.8%) experienced pneumonia which led to death. Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 22% of patients; the most common (≥1%) were liver enzyme increase, diarrhea, urinary tract infection, acute kidney injury, fatigue, joint pain, and pneumonia. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 42% of patients, the most frequent (≥2%) of which were urinary tract infection, hematuria, acute kidney injury, pneumonia, and urosepsis. In KEYNOTE-045, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 8% of 266 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. The most common adverse reaction resulting in permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA was pneumonitis (1.9%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 20% of patients; the most common (≥1%) were urinary tract infection (1.5%), diarrhea (1.5%), and colitis (1.1%). The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) in patients who received KEYTRUDA vs those who received chemotherapy were fatigue (38% vs 56%), musculoskeletal pain (32% vs 27%), pruritus (23% vs 6%), decreased appetite (21% vs 21%), nausea (21% vs 29%), and rash (20% vs 13%). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 39% of KEYTRUDA-treated patients, the most frequent (≥2%) of which were urinary tract infection, pneumonia, anemia, and pneumonitis. It is not known whether KEYTRUDA is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, instruct women to discontinue nursing during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the final dose. There is limited experience in pediatric patients. In a study of 40 pediatric patients with advanced melanoma, PD-L1–positive advanced, relapsed, or refractory solid tumors or lymphoma, patients were treated with KEYTRUDA for a median of 43 days (range 1 to 414 days), with 24 patients (60%) receiving treatment for 42 days or more. The safety profile in pediatric patients was similar to that seen in adults treated with KEYTRUDA. Toxicities that occurred at a higher rate (≥15% difference) in these patients when compared to adults under 65 years of age were fatigue (45%), vomiting (38%), abdominal pain (28%), hypertransaminasemia (28%), and hyponatremia (18%).

The FDA granted Priority Review with a PDUFA, or target action, date of Sept. 22, 2017. “An estimated nearly one-hundred-thousand people are living with gastric cancer in the U.S., yet little progress has been made in bringing forward new treatment options to these patients for whom chemotherapy has long been the standard of care,” said Dr. Roger Dansey, senior vice president and therapeutic area head, oncology late-stage development, Merck Research Laboratories. “We look forward to working with the FDA to bring KEYTRUDA to people with gastric cancer who have progressed after receiving chemotherapy and are in urgent need of another option.” The application submitted to the FDA is seeking approval for KEYTRUDA monotherapy in previously treated patients at a fixed dose of 200 mg administered intravenously every three weeks. The application is based on data from cohort one of the phase 2 KEYNOTE-059 trial investigating KEYTRUDA in heavily pretreated patients with recurrent or advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma that has progressed after two or more lines of chemotherapy. Data from cohort one of KEYNOTE-059 will be presented at the 53rd Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in Chicago, June 2 – 6, 2017 during an oral session on Sunday, June 4 at 9:00 a.m. – 9:12 a.m. CDT (Location: Hall D2). Merck is committed to investigating new approaches across the spectrum of cancers with more than 500 clinical trials evaluating KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) in more than 30 tumor types, including multiple gastrointestinal cancers like gastric cancer. Specific to gastric cancer, Merck’s broad clinical development program encompasses all stages of advanced disease and is investigating KEYTRUDA as monotherapy and in combination with other cancer treatments across multiple lines of therapy. To date, the program includes four gastric cancer registration-enabling studies and numerous other gastrointestinal cancer studies are underway. About Gastric Cancer Gastric cancer, also called stomach cancer, is a type of cancer that begins in the stomach and tends to develop slowly over many years. Most gastric cancers are adenocarcinomas, which develop from the cells of the innermost lining (mucosa) of the stomach. Risk factors for gastric cancer include gender, age, ethnicity, geography and infection with Helicobacter pylori. Worldwide, gastric cancer is the fifth most common type of cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death. Each year there are approximately 952,000 newly diagnosed cases of gastric cancer resulting in approximately 723,000 deaths worldwide. It is estimated that in 2017, more than 10,000 people will die from gastric cancer in the U.S. alone. About KEYTRUDA®(pembrolizumab) Injection KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. Studies of KEYTRUDA – from the largest immuno-oncology program in the industry with more than 500 trials – include a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand factors that predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including the exploration of several different biomarkers across a broad range of tumors. KEYTRUDA is administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every three weeks for the approved indications. KEYTRUDA for injection is supplied in a 100 mg single-dose vial. KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) Indications and Dosing Melanoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Lung Cancer KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥50%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is also indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and progression-free survival. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In metastatic NSCLC, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. When administering KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy, KEYTRUDA should be administered prior to chemotherapy when given on the same day. See also the Prescribing Information for pemetrexed and carboplatin. Head and Neck Cancer KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In HNSCC, KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), or who have relapsed after three or more prior lines of therapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In adults with cHL, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. In pediatric patients with cHL, KEYTRUDA is administered at a dose of 2 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 200 mg) every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Urothelial Carcinoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. KEYTRUDA is also indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. In locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 94 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%) pneumonitis, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (6.9%) compared to those without (2.9%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 48 (1.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) colitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 19 (0.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%) hepatitis. Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis. Hypophysitis occurred in 17 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%) hypophysitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency). Administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. KEYTRUDA can cause thyroid disorders, including hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and thyroiditis. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 96 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%) hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism occurred in 237 (8.5%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%) hypothyroidism. Thyroiditis occurred in 16 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%) thyroiditis. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. Administer replacement hormones for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. KEYTRUDA can cause type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia. KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 9 (0.3%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis. KEYTRUDA can cause other clinically important immune-mediated adverse reactions. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction. The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), exfoliative dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid, rash (1.4%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, and partial seizures arising in a patient with inflammatory foci in brain parenchyma. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and postmarketing use. Solid organ transplant rejection has been reported in postmarketing use of KEYTRUDA. Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider benefit of treatment with KEYTRUDA vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients. KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions, including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after being treated with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA on any trial, 6 patients (26%) developed graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), one of which was fatal, and 2 patients (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning, one of which was fatal. Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody before transplantation. These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute GVHD, severe (Grade 3 to 4) acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic VOD, and other immune-mediated adverse reactions, and intervene promptly. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of KEYTRUDA.

It is not known whether KEYTRUDA is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, instruct women to discontinue nursing during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the final dose. There is limited experience in pediatric patients. In a study of 40 pediatric patients with advanced melanoma, PD-L1–positive advanced, relapsed, or refractory solid tumors or lymphoma, patients were treated with KEYTRUDA for a median of 43 days (range 1 to 414 days), with 24 patients (60%) receiving treatment for 42 days or more. The safety profile in pediatric patients was similar to that seen in adults treated with KEYTRUDA. Toxicities that occurred at a higher rate (≥15% difference) in these patients when compared to adults under 65 years of age were fatigue (45%), vomiting (38%), abdominal pain (28%), hypertransaminasemia (28%), and hyponatremia (18%).

"We strive for continual innovation of our products for the benefit of our patients, and our new Pergoveris® Pen enables us to provide women and couples with an improved patient experience during their treatment journey." The new liquid version of Pergoveris® was created by evolving the original freeze-dried powder and solvent combination - which required patients to mix the product vials themselves before daily injection - towards a ready-to-use pre-filled Pen solution. By eliminating the need for mixing, the new Pergoveris® Pen allows an improved treatment experience for patients with severe follicle stimulating FSH and LH deficiency. The new Pergoveris® Pen is the only premixed combination of human FSH (hFSH) and human LH (hLH) on the European market available in a pre-filled injection device for self-administration. Designed with feedback from patients and healthcare professionals in mind, the Pergoveris® Pen enables physicians to individualize the dosing to patient's needs, by allowing for 12.5 IU increments and offering three strengths: 300IU, 450IU and 900IU. The Pergoveris® Pen is the third addition to Merck's innovative delivery solution Family of Pens™. About Pergoveris®   Pergoveris® is the first combined product of recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (r-hFSH or follitropin alfa 150 IU) and recombinant human luteinizing hormone (r-hLH or lutropin alfa 75 IU). It is unique by combining the benefits of two consistent and pure recombinant products, r-hFSH and r-hLH, for the treatment of infertility in specific indications. Pergoveris® is indicated for the stimulation of follicular development in adult women with severe luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) deficiency. The Family of Pens™  The Family of Pens™ consists of prefilled ready-to-use pens for GONAL-f® 300 IU, 450 IU, and 900 IU, and OVITRELLE®/OVIDREL® 250 mcg and will include the Pergoveris® Pen 300IU, 450IU and 900IU once approved. The Family of Pens™ was developed based on feedback from healthcare professionals and those experiencing fertility problems to provide a common injection solution for Merck's gonadotropins, in order to ease the teaching, learning and use of the pens.

The organic substance, however, remained in the research and development territory for more than 50 years until it started to be applied to wrist watches, calculators and computers -- products that ushered in a new era of technology in the 20th century. Therefore, the German company based in Darmstadt, did the same with the organic light-emitting diode, known as a future technology for the 21st century. Frank Stangenberg-Haverkamp, chairman of E. Merck KG (Merck) “OLED was not profitable at all from the beginning. But we took (a) long-term view for 10 years (thinking) that it may be the technology of the future. So, let’s go for it and we were right,” said Frank Stangenberg-Haverkamp, chairman of E. Merck KG, the parent company of Merck, in an interview with The Korea Herald last week. Merck, a life science and health care company, dominates the market for liquid crystals for displays. It is also a leading maker of OLED materials. But what made such long-term investment successful? Family, says the chairman. “It is the advantage of being a family-owned business because the family does think very long term. We don’t think in quarters, we think in generations,” he said. “We want to make sure whatever activities (we) have, it is ready for the future, ready to develop for the next 20, 30 years.” The chairman was referring to Merck’s unique governance structure that keeps the company under the control of the family but separates its management from the ownership. Merck is the oldest family-owned company, with more than 350 years of history. Its holding company, which has a 70.3 percent stake in Merck, is a joint stock company with money invested by 153 family members, who are the descendants of Heinrich Emanuel Merck, one of the founding fathers of the company. They hold a combined 70 percent stake in Merck, all inherited from their parents. They are not allowed to sell it, keeping them as investment of their ownership. Their shares are passed on to their children equally, regardless of gender. Through a general meeting, they elect 12 representatives for the family board who speaks for the interests of the family. The head of the board becomes the chairman of E. Merck KG. Stangenberg-Haverkamp, the 11th generation of the founding family, was appointed as the chairman of E. Merck KG in 2014. The most important job of the family board is to pick members for the board of partners, which the company calls the connection point between E. Merck KG and Merck. The board selects top managers, such as the CEO and CFO of Merck, who are not family members. The purpose of having non-family members as top managers of the global company -- which makes 15 billion euros ($16.9 billion) a year -- is to secure its leading position in the market. Complex business like Merck cannot be run only by family members, he said, stressing that the family needs outside help. “Empower non-family members to help you to run the business. Merck has already (started that) in 1930s,” he said. “You have to put them on the same level as the family members and that is what we still do.” The only way a family member can work at Merck is to first have their abilities proven at other companies. Only then can they apply for a top position. However, this seldom happens. “What we don’t want is a normal family member to work as a chemist in the company because immediately he (or she) would have conflict in the company. He is a family member, he’s got an access to myself, top board and his colleagues don’t have that,” said Stangenberg-Haverkamp, who once shared with Samsung’s heir apparent Lee Jae-yong the merits of separating management from ownership. “I know Mr. Lee, I met him. Mr. Lee was very interested in how we structured in and he wanted to learn (from it). I think his mindset has realized it, that it (Samsung) has to be changed,” the chairman said, calling him “a serious businessman.” Samsung is Merck’s major client in the field of biopharma and displays. “He will sometime comeback and would probably change things. But it is a process. It takes time. But in the end, everybody will go this way, simply to make sure that the business can develop itself free of a single family. Family can control it, but one thing to control the business is not to run it. (If not) it could lead into conflict.” Asked of his impression of family feuds over management rights at South Korean conglomerates, the chairman stressed the importance of keeping family ethics in the business. “(I tell my family that) you didn’t work for it, don’t forget that. So you are not entitled to anything, you just inherited,” he said. “But if you want more, you have to work for it.” Merck's headquarters in Darmstadt, Germany (Merck)Stangenberg-Haverkamp was visiting Seoul for a two-day trip to meet Merck’s clients in Korea and young Korean employees to present them with Merck’s future strategy. Merck operates in more than 150 countries with 66 subsidiaries around the world. The company launched its operation in Korea in 1985. Its annual revenue reached 1.16 trillion won ($1.03 billion) last year. Before joining the family board, the 68-year-old chairman worked as an investment banker for 20 years in London. The job he hopes to do as the chairman of the holding company is to make sure that the business is safe, not necessarily in terms of bigger profits. Staying modest is the key to sustaining the legacy of Merck and continuing its quest for future science, he added. “Ferraris, private jets and yachts, we don’t have that,” he said. “The moment you become greedy -- taking the money off -- and you start to jeopardize the business. It (the lesson) is not from me, it’s the work of 10 generations before me.” By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com) 영어뉴스를 통한 ListeningㆍReading 실력 향상 단기 학습 프로그램 [NEST] 1.

Meet the Contributors → FDA Landmark Nod: Cancer Drug To Match Tumor Genes, Not Tissue Type Ben Fidler May 23rd, 2017 @benthefidler @xconomy Like Us Xconomy National —  For many years, doctors and researchers have known that cancers in different parts of the body can share genetic abnormalities. For the first time, the FDA has approved a drug based on those abnormalities and not on the organ in which the cancer originated. It’s a moment that a lot of people in the cancer field have been waiting for. The CEO of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and former top Genentech official Susan Desmond-Hellman wrote on Twitter: “20 yrs ago at Genentech I gave a speech dreaming of a cancer clinic with doors saying ‘HER2, EGFR, ..’, not ‘Breast, Kidney,…’ Maybe now?” (HER2 and EGFR are well-known genetic alterations in various cancers.) The approval is for pembrolizumab (Keytruda), which has already received approval in skin, lung, kidney, and other cancers. The FDA now says pembrolizumab, from Kenilworth, NJ-based Merck (NYSE: MRK), can be used for children and adults whose advanced solid tumors have conditions known as microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR), and haven’t responded to prior treatment. MSI-H and dMMR tumors have lost the ability that cells normally use to repair their own DNA errors. Without that ability, cells with DNA errors can proliferate and turn into cancer. “This is an important first for the cancer community,” said Richard Pazdur, the acting director of the FDA’s office of hematology and oncology products, in the agency’s announcement. MSI-H and dMMR cells can be found in patients with several tumor types, including colorectal, endometrial, and stomach cancers. About 5 percent of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, for example, have MSI-H or dMMR tumors, according to the FDA’s statement. The FDA decision was based on five clinical trials enrolling 149 patients with MSI-H or dMMR solid tumors across 15 cancer types. Of the 149 patients, 39.6 percent had at least a partial response to treatment, meaning their tumors shrunk. The response lasted at least six months for 78 percent of those patients. Drew Pardoll, the director of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy—where, it should be noted, the early research regarding these genetic insights originated—told Xconomy that patients with MSI-H or dMMR tumors tend to respond very poorly to chemotherapy. Their luck has now changed, he says. Genetic testing is now available to identify these abnormalities, and people with these tumors tend to respond well to treatment with a so-called checkpoint inhibitor that blocks a protein called PD-1, like Merck’s pembrolizumab. “I predict that this is going to be the single most commonly done genetic test in oncology,” Pardoll said. “It’s going to be done all over the place.” Johns Hopkins has filed for a patent for a companion diagnostic testing for MSI-H or dMMR tumors, and has licensed that technology to a company in Baltimore called Personal Genome Diagnostics. A Johns Hopkins spokesperson said the institution may thus stand to benefit, but it’s not clear to what extent since the test is already widely used and can be done by many companies and hospitals. The approval could help push adoption of broad cancer genetic tests, which insurers have been slow to cover. The more evidence that tests are steering patients to better results from expensive therapies—and away from therapies that are not likely to benefit them—the more chance insurers will pay for those tests, said Dana-Farber Cancer Institute president and CEO Laurie Glimcher at an Xconomy forum last week. “It’s going to cost some money to do those kinds of tests,” said Glimcher. “But ultimately you’re not going to be putting patients on drugs that you can predict they will not respond to. I have to believe that the economics will eventually triumph.” Cancer immunotherapies have produced stunning results in recent years, but they face significant limitations. Only a fraction of patients respond to drugs like pembrolizumab and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s nivolumab (Opdivo), and researchers are still trying to figure out why. Companies are combining these drugs with a variety of others hoping more patients will respond, and more cancers will be impacted. Many of these studies, however, will likely fail. Finding more biomarkers like MSI-H, and uncovering more genetic clues as to why two patients with the same type of cancer will have different results, could help increase the odds of success. “I worry that [so many companies] race into phase 3 trials and there’s not enough biomarker work to understand why things work and why they don’t work,” Pardoll said. The FDA’s decision was an “accelerated” approval, on a thinner body of evidence than is typically required. That means that the FDA can withdraw its approval if the drug fails to show the anticipated benefit in ongoing studies. Ben Fidler is Xconomy's Deputy Biotechnology Editor.

Wilson Sonsini tops Life Sciences Law Firm Index for 2nd straight year Biotech, Pharma In landmark move, FDA approves cancer drug for a biomarker not a tissue By Juliet Preston Post a comment / at 8:39 PM Shares5 Colon, pancreatic, stomach, or ovarian cancer; it increasingly shouldn’t matter. In an era of precision medicine, the treatment approach should reflect the genetic makeup of the person’s tumor and the presence or absence of key biomarkers. That ethos was set in stone on Tuesday, with the landmark FDA approval of Merck’s checkpoint inhibitor, Keytruda (pembrolizumab), for patients with solid tumors that express so-called mismatched repair genes. In a statement, FDA noted the historic nature of its decision. “This is the first time the agency has approved a cancer treatment based on a common biomarker rather than the location in the body where the tumor originated.” It has been a long time in the making. Scientists’ understanding of cancer has shifted dramatically in the 21st Century, helped along by initiatives such as the human genome project and the advent of next-generation sequencing. One of the biggest revelations has been the degree of heterogeneity between cancers that arise from a single tissue: A breast cancer might be more akin to a melanoma than another breast cancer. As a result, it often makes sense to classify cancers based on their genetics, not their origin, when selecting oncology treatments. Following today’s approval, one the defining features of certain solid tumors will be whether they are microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). Both are abnormalities that affect the proper repair of DNA inside the cell (aka mismatch repair genes). According to FDA, colorectal, endometrial and gastrointestinal cancers have the highest rates of these mutations. MSI-H and dMMR also appear, albeit less commonly, in cancers arising in the breast, prostate, bladder, thyroid gland and other places. Approximately 5 percent of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer have MSI-H or dMMR tumors. Scientists at the Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy at Johns Hopkins Medicine were the first to hypothesize that tumors with these mismatch repair genes would be particularly susceptible to immunotherapies, such as Keytruda. The idea was advanced into clinical trials and ultimately given the green light via FDA’s accelerated approval route. Keytruda is already approved for the treatment of certain patients with metastatic melanoma, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer, refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and urothelial carcinoma. Other checkpoint inhibitors, such as Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo, are hot on Merck’s heels chasing market share. Is medicine ready? It’s one thing to get an FDA approval, it’s another to implement this form of medicine nationwide. As many observers noted on Twitter, oncologists often specialize based on the tissue of origin. They’re colon cancer or breast cancer experts. Perhaps more importantly, the bulk of cancer patients in the U.S. still aren’t having their tumors sequenced. The next-generation sequencing diagnostics can cost thousands of dollars and insurers have argued that the clinical utility isn’t there. Medicare and Medicaid have taken the same stance. Today’s approval could help the industry move forward. Indeed, it has been noted that the lack of routine sequencing holds back recruitment for clinical trials, which in turn limits the approval of drugs that would validate the sequencing. Scott Tomlins, co-founder and laboratory director of Strata Oncology, stressed via email that there is much more work to be done to break this treatment stalemate. Strata deals with it firsthand through its work matching eligible patients with precision medicine trials. “Results like this confirm that we should be assessing the critical and targetable molecular alterations driving every individual’s cancer,” Tomlins said. “However, it is critical to recognize that with presently available drugs, only a small subset of patients with cancer are likely to benefit from this or most other targeted therapies. Thus, finding patients whose tumors have highly targetable alterations, and enrolling them onto the most appropriate clinical trials remain the critical barriers to accelerating approval of promising therapies and gaining widespread reimbursement for molecular profiling.” There’s also value in ruling out patients that are unlikely to respond to personalized therapies. Keytruda launched in the U.S. with a list price of $12,500 per patient per month, or $150,000 per year. Many trials are underway studying checkpoint inhibitors as part of combination therapies, which would see the cost climb further. The case is definitely building for genetic testing, as means to finding the right individuals and saving the expense and struggle of treating those who are unlikely to benefit.

The Competition and Markets Authority said that Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD) had broken the law by abusing its dominant position to discount Remicade, the brand name of a medicine called infliximab used to treat patients with conditions such as Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis. The provisional findings of the CMA’s investigation, which was launched in December 2015, found that the scheme was likely to restrict competition from “biosimilar” versions of the drug that were new to the market. Merck lost exclusivity on Remicade in February 2015 in major European markets and… Want to read more? Register with a few details to continue reading this article. Get access Already a subscriber?

The approval marks a major step in so-called precision medicine, where genetic biomarkers may determine the course of therapy rather than the type of cancer. The hope is that advanced genetic information will one day be able to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from a specific treatment. "Until now, the FDA has approved cancer treatments based on where in the body the cancer started - for example, lung or breast cancers," said Richard Pazdur, head of oncology products for the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. Merck shares rose about 1 percent to $64.65. The accelerated approval was for solid tumor cancers not eligible for surgery or that have spread in patients identified as having a biomarker called microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). Tumors with those traits are most common in colorectal, endometrial and gastrointestinal cancers, but may also appear in cancers of the breast, prostate, bladder, pancreas, thyroid gland and others. Dr. Drew Pardoll, director of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute that designed and led the trial that led to the historic approval, called it "a marriage of cancer genetics and cancer immunology." Patients whose tumors are laden with the genetic defect have an abundance of abnormal proteins that look more foreign to immune cells, triggering them to search out and destroy the cancer cells. Keytruda belongs to a new class of drugs called PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors that block a mechanism tumors use to evade detection from cancer-fighting cells. There are now five such drugs available for a variety of cancers. "This was one of those eureka trials where it didn't take a lot of patients to see this was going to be something major," Pardoll said in an interview. He said about 4 percent of advanced cancers, or 15,000 to 20,000 cases each year in the United States, carry the genetic traits addressed in the approval. Tests for the specific genetic defects are widely available, costing between $300 and $600. The approval covers children and adults whose cancer has progressed despite prior treatment and those who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options, including patients whose colorectal cancer has progressed following chemotherapy. The FDA grants accelerated approvals to drugs for serious conditions with unmet medical needs if the treatment appears to have effects deemed reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit. Merck must still conduct studies to confirm the anticipated benefit. The approval further solidifies Merck's leading position in the burgeoning field of treatments that help the immune system fight cancer, a mantle it seized last year when Keytruda extended survival as an initial treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Keytruda was previously approved to treat advanced melanoma, advanced NSCLC, head and neck cancers and classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Last week it won U.S. approval for bladder cancer and is awaiting an FDA decision for gastric cancer.

The approval marks the first time the U.S. health regulator has approved a cancer drug based on a biomarker - a biological signal that suggests an increased or decreased risk for a disease. "Until now, the FDA has approved cancer treatments based on where in the body the cancer started — for example, lung or breast cancers," said Richard Pazdur, acting director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. "We have now approved a drug based on a tumor's biomarker without regard to the tumor's original location." (bit.ly/2qh8BQd) Keytruda, which is already approved to treat various cancers, belongs to a new class of drugs, called PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors, that block a mechanism tumors use to evade detection by the immune system. On Tuesday, the FDA approved Keytruda for patients with solid tumors that have been identified as having a biomarker called microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient. The approval covers patients whose cancer has progressed despite prior treatment and those who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. It also includes patients with colorectal cancer whose disease has advanced despite chemotherapy.

The approval marks a major step in so-called precision medicine, where genetic biomarkers may determine the course of therapy rather than the type of cancer. The hope is that advanced genetic information will one day be able to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from a specific treatment. "Until now, the FDA has approved cancer treatments based on where in the body the cancer started - for example, lung or breast cancers," said Richard Pazdur, head of oncology products for the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. Merck shares rose about 1 percent to $64.65. The accelerated approval was for solid tumor cancers not eligible for surgery or that have spread in patients identified as having a biomarker called microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). Tumors with those traits are most common in colorectal, endometrial and gastrointestinal cancers, but may also appear in cancers of the breast, prostate, bladder, pancreas, thyroid gland and others. Dr. Drew Pardoll, director of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute that designed and led the trial that led to the historic approval, called it "a marriage of cancer genetics and cancer immunology." Patients whose tumors are laden with the genetic defect have an abundance of abnormal proteins that look more foreign to immune cells, triggering them to search out and destroy the cancer cells. Keytruda belongs to a new class of drugs called PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors that block a mechanism tumors use to evade detection from cancer-fighting cells. There are now five such drugs available for a variety of cancers. "This was one of those eureka trials where it didn't take a lot of patients to see this was going to be something major," Pardoll said in an interview. He said about 4 percent of advanced cancers, or 15,000 to 20,000 cases each year in the United States, carry the genetic traits addressed in the approval. Tests for the specific genetic defects are widely available, costing between $300 and $600. The approval covers children and adults whose cancer has progressed despite prior treatment and those who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options, including patients whose colorectal cancer has progressed following chemotherapy. The FDA grants accelerated approvals to drugs for serious conditions with unmet medical needs if the treatment appears to have effects deemed reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit. Merck must still conduct studies to confirm the anticipated benefit. The approval further solidifies Merck's leading position in the burgeoning field of treatments that help the immune system fight cancer, a mantle it seized last year when Keytruda extended survival as an initial treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Keytruda was previously approved to treat advanced melanoma, advanced NSCLC, head and neck cancers and classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Last week it won U.S. approval for bladder cancer and is awaiting an FDA decision for gastric cancer.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 23 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Hospital Acquired Infection Treatment Market Research Report: Comprehensive Analysis and Future Estimations 2024 Hospital Acquired Infection Treatment Market The global market for hospital acquired infection (HAI) treatment features an exceedingly fragmented vendor landscape, with no leading vendor accounting for a dominant share in the market in 2015, observes Transparency Market Research in a recent report. Notable players in the market, including Merck & Co., Inc., Abbott, Bayer AG, and Pfizer, Inc., struggle for profitable returns amid the emerging threat of generics following patent expirations of several blockbuster drugs. Although strict barriers in form of complex approval procedures and stringent regulatory framework in several regional markets exist, the market has witnessed the entry of a large number of new players in the past few years. The threat of new entrants remains high in the near future owing to the promising market for generics and a slew of new players is expected to enter the global HAI treatment market in the next few years, further intensifying the level of competition. Transparency Market Research states that the global HAI treatment market will exhibit a moderate 2.7% CAGR from 2016 through 2024, rising from a valuation of US$28.99 bn in 2015 to US$36.61 bn in 2024. This exhaustive report includes 36 data tables and 140 figures to give readers a 360° view of the Hospital Acquired Infection Treatment Market. Browse through this 198-page report to know what factors will shape the market during the period 2016-2024 www.transparencymarketresearch.com/hospital-acquired-infe… North America Market to Retain Dominance Of the key HAI treatment types examined in the report, the segment of antibacterial treatment takes the lead in terms of demand and consumption. The rising prevalence of hospital acquired bacterial infections across the globe is likely to allow the segment of antibacterial treatment retain its dominance in the global HAI treatment market over the forecast period. From a geographical perspective, the global HAI treatment market is dominated by North America, followed by Europe. The regional market valued at US$10,272.70 mn in 2016 and is expected to retain its dominant position over the forecast period as well. The rapidly rising pool of geriatric patients and the presence of some of the world’s leading pharmaceutical companies will allow the region to remain dominant. Rising Geriatric Population and Increased Demand across Emerging Economies to Propel Market Some of the chief factors that are presently driving the global demand for effective HAI treatments are the rising geriatric population and the increased focus on improving healthcare infrastructures in developing and less-developed economies. The geriatric population is more prone to a number of infections and are a demographic that account for a massive share in the overall expenditure on healthcare and wellness spent by any society. The threat of developing nosocomial infections is significantly high in elderly people owing to their low immunity to diseases. Therefore, as the world’s population ages, the demand for HAI treatment methods is also expected to rise at a significant pace in the next few years. Rising Numbers of Multidrug Resistance Microorganisms Drive Demand for Alternative Treatments One of the key factor hindering the growth of the global HAI treatment market is the steadily rising numbers of multidrug resistance (MDR) microorganisms that resist multiple antimicrobial drugs. Resistance to most available treatment methods and drugs is threatening the public health and pressuring the healthcare industry to find alternative treatments, restricting the adoption of standard nosocomial infection drugs to a notable extent. Nevertheless, the market could benefit from the several drug candidates for treating hospital acquired infections that are presently in the pipelines of some of the leading pharmaceutical companies of the globe. The increasing focus on the rising prevalence of HAIs in emerging economies has generated vast untapped growth opportunities in the form of elderly population from the lower and middle income categories. These opportunities can prove to be beneficial for established players as well as new entrants in regions such as Asia Pacific and Latin America.

Merck (known as MSD outside North America) stumped up $500m upfront to buy Afferent last June - with another $750m in milestone payments - to get its hands on the company's pipeline of compounds that target P2X3 purinergic receptors. At the highest dose tested (50mg orally twice daily), Afferent's lead drug AF-219 - now called MK-7264 - reduced the number of coughs per hour by 37% compared to placebo, although two lower doses (7.5mg and 20mg) were ineffective. Now Merck says it plans to discuss the design of phase III trials with regulatory authorities to take the drug forward. At the moment there are no approved therapies for suppressing chronic cough - defined as lasting for eight weeks or more - which is estimated to affect up to 10% of people in the US. Around 17% of persistent cough sufferers derive no benefit from current treatments such as opioid drugs and corticosteroids, and in some cases the symptoms can persist for months or even years. "There is a significant unmet need for effective treatments for chronic cough," commented Jacky Smith, professor of respiratory medicine at the University of Manchester and one of the investigators in the trial. "We are encouraged by the results of the MK-7264 study and look forward to further evaluations of this investigational therapy." P2X3 receptors are thought to become over-activated in chronic cough, playing a role in the hyper-sensitisation of neurons in airways that trigger the cough reflex. The Afferent purchase also gave Merck an in-road into the emerging market for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a market tipped to be worth more than $3bn in the next few years. Two drugs have been approved for IPF - Roche's Esbriet (pirfenidone) and Boehringer Ingelheim's Ofev (nintedanib) - but while they can delay disease progression neither has a significant impact on symptoms such as cough. MK-7264 is currently in early-stage testing for IPF. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 23 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Vaccines market to reach $61.6 Billion by 2024 – Ameri Research Inc. Vaccines Market Outlook To 2024: Key ProductCategories (Live Attenuated Vaccines, Inactivated Vaccines, Subunit Vaccines, Toxoid Vaccines, Conjugate Vaccines, DNA Vaccines,) By Disease Type, By End-Use, Regional Segmentation, Competitive Dynamics, M&A Insights, Pricing Analysis (OPP, IPP, RAP), AndSegment Forecast. 23rd May 2017, Florida-The global vaccines market size worth USD 61.6 billion by 2024, according to a new research study published by Ameri Research. The market is expected to witness strong demand due to increasing number of immunization programs, high investment in research & development, growing awareness about vaccination and access to healthcare facilities in the emerging and developing regions. The growing prevalence of chronic diseases, therise in healthcare expenditure and constant support from stakeholders such as government agencies, WHO (World Health Organization), UNICEF (The United Nations Children’s Fund) in improving access to vaccination are some of the factors positively reinforcing the market growth. For instance, the number of people vaccinated for tuberculosis, polio, measles, influenza, hepatitis and other diseases is growing every year. The U.S. has one of the largest immunization programs with a vaccination rate of 84.2% for diphtheria, tetanus, 93.3% for polio, and 91.5% for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR). Moreover, in 2014, the Ebola outbreak in western Africa led to severe loss of human lives. It was declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern under the WHO International Health Regulations (2005). The WHO estimates that nearly 14,124 Ebola cases were reported in Sierra Leone, 3,811 cases in Guinea, and 10,675 cases in Liberia. Moreover, in 2014-2015 approximately 20,000 people were vaccinated by products manufactured by Johnson & Johnson, GlaxoSmithKline, and Merck. To ensure thecreation of an Ebola drug stockpile, the GAVI Alliance and Merck Sharp & Dohme Corporation have entered into a USD 5 million advance purchase agreement. The bargaining power of buyers and suppliers variesin different regions, due to the healthcare expenditure, access to medicines and government support. The high-income regions usually invest in procuring the technologically advanced products, however the emerging nations are inclined toward the use of generic products due to affordability and budget constraints. To drive the vaccination programs, agencies such as UNICEF, PAHO procure vaccines in large quantities for supplying in more than 100 countries. Click the link below to view the report description: – https://www.ameriresearch.com/product/vaccines-market-outlook-2024   Key findings from the study: – The inactivated vaccines segment dominated the market in 2016. However, strong demand for DNA vaccines is anticipated to drive growth over the forecast period. In 2016, pneumococcal disease segment accounted for the largest revenue share and is expected to extend its dominance over the forecast period. North America was the leading region with nearly over 41% share. The high share of this region can be attributed due to the high healthcare expenditure, technological advancements and a large number of immunization programs. However, Asia Pacific is expected to register the highest CAGR of 9.7% over the forecast period. Some of the key market participants include Novartis AG, AstraZeneca Plc, Sanofi Pasteur, Inc., Takeda Pharmaceuticals Company Ltd., Emergent BioSolutions, Inc., Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.,GlaxoSmithKline, plc., Astellas Pharma Inc., and others.

It’s the first published evidence to support the CDC’s latest recommendation that two doses of the vaccine are more than sufficient to protect against genital warts for children between the ages of 11 and 12. It’s important to note that the three-dose series of Gardasil first became available in 2006 — over ten years ago. Cervarix hit the market in 2009. At least 32,000 families have reported adverse events following administration of an HPV vaccine, and at least 144 deaths have been documented. Many of these events occur after the second or third dose of the vaccine. And now, after more than a decade has passed, researchers are saying “Oops, we were wrong, three is too many.”  Has it really taken them ten years to figure it out, or is the evidence of harm just growing too great? Rebecca Perkins, MD, an obstetrician at Boston Medical Center and the study’s lead author commented, “The CDC and WHO based the new two dose schedule primarily on immunogenicity results, but there was very little research on how effective that recommendation has been. This study validates the new recommendations and allows us to confidently move forward with the 2 dose schedule for the prevention of genital warts.” However, manufacturers are still recommending the 3-dose schedule for some children under the age of 15. Furthermore, this recent finding raises questions about the vaccine recommendations for people over the age 15, who are still under the 3-dose recommendation category. As you may know, the HPV vaccine is also touted as being able to prevent cancer caused by certain strains of HPV. In spite of the big push for these vaccines, there is reason to believe that they are not as “protective” as they are proclaimed to be. As Celeste McGovern of the Children’s Medical Safety Research Institute (CMSRI) explains, Merck’s clinical trials for their HPV vaccine, Gardasil, were just three years long. However, it can take 20 to 40 years for cervical cancer to manifest as a result of HPV infection. The “long-term” benefits of this vaccine are undeniably unclear — and at best, are an overstatement. At worst, the perceived benefit of so-called “cancer prevention” is a gross exaggeration. According to Dr. Diane Harper, who led clinical trials of the HPV vaccine, explains that in order for the vaccine to be effective at preventing cancer, it needs to hold its efficacy for at least 15 years after administration. However, Merck’s Gardasil is estimated to be “effective” against HPV for a measly 4.5 years. GlaxoSmithKline’s Cervarix inoculation doesn’t fare much better, and is estimated to last for just 8.4 years. In other words, neither vaccine satisfies the 15-year requirement for actual cancer prevention. McGovern explains further, “Just 8 in 100,000 develop cervical cancer each year in the United States thanks to cervical cancer screening. Yet simulation modeling operating under assumptions of 100% vaccination coverage and lifetime immunity predicts that the incidence rate would be 9.5 per 100,000 in the absence of screening with Cervarix and 14 per 100,000 with Gardasil. So even under these best-case scenarios, vaccination likely would not be more effective than screening at preventing cervical cancer [emphasis added].” In other words, these vaccines do nothing to actually prevent cancer in real life — despite the overwhelming exaggeration of their benefits. There is an extreme amount of over-confidence in the success of HPV vaccines, when there is little evidence available to actually demonstrate their purported benefits. A three-year clinical trial for a disease that would take a minimum of 20 years to manifest is nothing short of lacking, and it doesn’t take an expert to understand why. How can a vaccine claim to protect against something that hasn’t actually been fully tested? And, in essence, are they not testing these vaccines on those who get them?

The 2017 annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) is set to run from June 2 to June 6 in Chicago. Historically, this conference has been known to make or break companies, with winners walking away with a nice gain and losers trying to pick up the pieces. The abstracts for ASCO have already been released, and there already have been some moves in anticipation. Here, 24/7 Wall St. is specifically taking a look at Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) and what Credit Suisse sees happening for this pharma giant at ASCO. Credit Suisse has an Outperform rating with a $72 price target, implying an upside of over 12% from the current price level. The brokerage firm commented in its report: For Merck, focus on executing on I-O/chemo, while progress with Keytruda+IDO also encouraging. The various datasets for Keytruda in combination with Incyte’s epacodastat will generate a lot of interest from an Incyte perspective. From a Merck perspective the news is obviously less impactful but we think it is still encouraging that the combination is progressing as it leaves Merck in a potential leadership position with the PD- 1/PD-L1 plus IDO combination should it end up making it to the market in various indications. Merck’s Abstract 9094 includes additional data from the KEYNOTE-021 Cohort G that recently obtained accelerated approval by the FDA for the treatment of first-line nonsquamous, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Credit Suisse believes that the data in the abstract looks fairly comparable to what the firm saw at ESMO last year and what is now in the product’s approved prescribing information. Credit Suisse ended its report saying: We remain optimistic on Merck’s ability to roll out the combination commercially in the coming weeks and months and establish a strong foothold in the 1L NSCLC market ahead of the entry of potential competitors. Outside of lung cancer, we are especially impressed by the efficacy seen with Keytruda in combination with standard neoadjuvant therapy in high-risk breast cancer, most notably in triple negative breast cancer (abstract 506). The efficacy follow up from the Phase 2 KEYNOTE-052 trial in 1st line bladder cancer (abstract 4502) is slightly improved from what we saw back at ESMO, providing reassurance ahead of ASCO as well as the June 14th PDUFA date for the drug in both 1st line and 2nd line bladder cancer. Shares of Merck traded up fractionally at $64.36 Tuesday morning, with a consensus analyst price target of $69.30 and a 52-week trading range of $55.10 to $66.80.

Veterinary Vaccines are important and, at times, essential tools for prevention or control of a given animal disease, but they require complementary actions like enabling legislation, investment for diagnostic, early response, public communication etc. The growing demand for livestock products (fuelled by population growth, increased urbanisation and greater purchasing power of individuals in developing or middle- income countries) coupled with the necessity of complying with the standards of trade agreements, mean that governments in the Middle-East & Africa region must improve animal health in their countries. Request a sample of this report @ http://www.orbisresearch.com/contacts/request-sample/292962 . Veterinary vaccine market has shown significant growth in recent years which can be attributed to increasing incidences of animal pandemics in the region.

This marks the estimation of further growth in the market in terms of livestock vaccine sales. However, International and regional collaboration has proven successful in the progressive control of these pandemics, e.g. the work of the Pan American Foot-and-Mouth Disease Centre in South America and the European Union FMD Commission which this region lacks.

The wrong diagnosis and the major effects on the body of the infected person have directly resulted in the diagnosis of Herpes Zoster and development in its drugs. Market Research Hub (MRH) has detailed the pipeline review of the infection in the report „Herpes Zoster (Shingles) – Pipeline Review, H1 2017″ that has been recently added to its massive repository. The study is a detailed pipeline analysis of Herpes Zoster (Shingles) with therapeutic development by companies and the drug used for Herpes Zoster. Request Free Sample Report: http://www.marketresearchhub.com/enquiry.php?type=S&repid=1068031 Shingles (herpes zoster) is a painful, blistering skin rash caused by the varicella-zoster virus. The various symptoms are headache, joint pain, fever and chills, and swollen glands. Treatment includes antihistamines and pain relievers. Shingles mostly occur when the virus that causes chickenpox starts up again in the body. After a person gets healthier from chickenpox, the virus becomes dormant in the nerve roots; in some cases, it stays dormant forever, in others, the virus „wakes up” when the immune system weakens. Some medicines may also trigger the virus to wake up and cause the infection. The pipeline review starts with the Herpes Zoster (Shingles) overview and the various therapeutic development and assessment that are currently in progress. This pipeline review has been analyzed by companies and products under development by companies. Further, the therapeutic assessment is completed in the research by the target, mechanism of action (MoA), route of administration and molecule type. The companies involved in therapeutics development of the Herpes Zoster (Shingles) are also listed in the report, the main companies profiled are ContraVir Pharmaceuticals Inc., Epiphany Biosciences Inc., Astellas Pharma Inc., Beijing Minhai Biotechnology Co Ltd., Foamix Pharmaceuticals Ltd., GeneOne Life Science Inc., GlaxoSmithKline Plc, Merck & Co Inc., NAL Pharmaceuticals Ltd., NanoViricides Inc., SK Chemicals Co Ltd., TSRL Inc. and XBiotech Inc.

"Following" : "Follow"}} May 23, 2017 2:09pm   Comments Share: Related GSK Citi Prefers These 4 Stocks Over Pfizer On Bottom-Line Concerns Turing Rejects $100 Million Offer For Daraprim Barclays initiated coverage of Zymeworks Inc (NYSE: ZYME) with an Overweight rating and price target of $20. The company released first-quarter earnings last week, reporting ($1.13) EPS on the quarter with revenue of $0.23 million. Early-Stage, But Potentially Important Zymeworks is a biopharma company focused on developing cancer treatments. Its most advanced asset is ZW25, an antibody currently being studied for the treatment of HER2+ cancers such as breast, gastric and ovarian. Early data suggests efficacy and safety, and Barclays analyst Geoff Meacham, in a recent note, highlighted high unmet medical need for HER2+ cancer treatments. Large Biopharma Partners “Zymeworks also has a broader antibody platform, which is the basis for several collaboration agreements,” wrote Meacham. Another asset of note is ZW33, a bispecific antibody conjugate. These agreements are with major players in the pharmaceutical sector, including GlaxoSmithKline plc (ADR) (NYSE: GSK), Eli Lilly and Co (NYSE: LLY) and Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK). The analyst believes that sales could easily reach $1 billion if ZW25 or ZW33 are successful. Catalysts To Look Out For Meacham expects the upcoming American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in June to be the nearest big driver of Zymeworks shares. Clinical progression of ZW25 in the second half of fiscal 2017 and ZW33 in early 2018 will also impact shares.

Nanotherapeutics, Nanoviricides, Abraxis, Arrowhead Research, Celgene Corporation, Bio-Gate & Merck News provided by Research and Markets 23 May, 2017, 09:45 ET Share this article DUBLIN, May 23, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Nanomedicine Market Analysis By Products, (Therapeutics, Regenerative Medicine, Diagnostics), By Application, (Clinical Oncology, Infectious diseases), By Nanomolecule (Gold, Silver, Iron Oxide, Alumina), & Segment Forecasts, 2013 - 2025" report to their offering. The global nanomedicine market is anticipated to reach USD 350.8 billion by 2025 Development of novel nanotechnology-based drugs and therapies is driven by the need to develop therapies that have fewer side effects and that are more cost-effective than traditional therapies, in particular for cancer. Application of nanotechnology-based contrast reagents for diagnosis and monitoring of the effects of drugs on an unprecedented short timescale is also attributive drive growth in the coming years. Additionally, demand for biodegradable implants with longer lifetimes that enable tissue restoration is anticipated to influence demand. As per the WHO factsheet, cancer is found to be one of the major causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide, with approximately 14 million new cases in 2012 and 8.2 million cancer-related deaths. Thus, demand for nanomedicine in order to curb such high incidence rate is expected to boost market progress during the forecast period. Solutions such as nanoformulations with triggered release for tailor-made pharmacokinetics, nanoparticles for local control of tumor in combination with radiotherapy, and functionalized nanoparticles for targeted in-vivo activation of stem cell production are anticipated to drive R&D, consequently resulting in revenue generation in the coming years. Biopharmaceutical and medical devices companies are actively engaged in development of novel products as demonstrated by the increasingly growing partnerships between leading enterprises and nanomedicine startups. For instance, in November 2015, Ablynx and Novo Nordisk signed a global collaboration and a licensing agreement for development and discovery of innovative drugs with multi-specific nanobodies. This strategic partnership is anticipated to rise the net annual sales of the products uplifting the market growth. However, in contrary with the applications of nanotechnology, the entire process of lab to market approval is a tedious and expensive one with stringent regulatory evaluation involved thereby leading investors to remain hesitant for investments. Further key findings from the report suggest: Therapeutics accounted for the largest share of market revenue in 2016 owing to presence of nanoemulsions, nanoformulations, or nanodevices These devices possess the ability to cross biological barriers. Moreover, presence of drugs such as Doxil, Abraxane, and Emend is attributive for higher revenue generation Presence of substantial number of products manufactured through the use of microbial sources can be attributed for the largest share In-vitro diagnostics is expected to witness lucrative progress as a result of R&D carried out in this segment Introduction of nano-enabled biomarkers, vectors and contrast agents with high-specificity and sensitivity are attributive for projected progress Clinical cardiology is expected to witness the fastest growth through to 2025 owing to development in nano-functionalization and modification of surfaces for increased biocompatibility of implants in treatment of late thrombosis Moreover, an abundance of research publications and patent filings from European region with a share of about 25% in nanomedicine-related publications is supportive for revenue generation from European economies Asia Pacific is estimated to witness the fastest growth over the forecast period Factors responsible include government and regulatory authorities that have implemented a framework to encourage R&D collaborations and framework extension. Key players operating in this industry include Pfizer Inc., Ablynx NV, Nanotherapeutics Inc., Nanoviricides Inc., Abraxis Inc., Arrowhead Research Inc., Celgene Corporation, Bio-Gate AG, and Merck Active expansion strategies are undertaken by a number of the major market entities in order to strengthen their position North America dominated the industry in 2016, accounting for a 42% of total revenue Presence of key participants operating in the region are involved in collaborative activities are attributive for the largest share of North America in sector revenue Key Topics Covered: 1 Research Methodology 2 Executive Summary 3 Nanomedicine Market Variables, Trends & Scope 4 Nanomedicine Market: Product Estimates & Trend Analysis 5 Nanomedicine Market: Application Estimates & Trend Analysis 6 Nanomedicine Market: Nanomolecule Type Estimates & Trend Analysis 7 Nanomedicine Market: Regional Estimates & Trend Analysis, by Product, Application, & Nanomolecule Type 8 Competitive Landscape CALANDO PHARMACEUTICALS, Inc.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 23 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Rosetta Genomics Enters Collaboration to Develop a microRNA Classifier Relating to Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Considered for Treatment with Immuno-oncology Drugs PHILADELPHIA, PA and REHOVOT, ISRAEL / ACCESSWIRE / May 23, 2017 / Rosetta Genomics Ltd. (NASDAQ: ROSG), a genomic diagnostics company that improves treatment decisions by providing timely and accurate diagnostic information to physicians, announces that the Company has entered into a collaboration with Meir Medical Center (Kfar Saba, Israel) to conduct a study to identify differentially expressed microRNAs between PD-L1 positive (>50%) and PD-L1 negative samples obtained from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who were considered for treatment with an immuno-oncology drug. The principal investigator, Maya Gottfried, M.D., is the Head of Oncology and Head of Lung Oncology at Meir Medical Center. Dr. Gottfried is a key opinion leader in oncology who has led numerous immuno-oncology clinical trials, and has more than 30 articles published in peer-reviewed, high-impact scientific publications. Results of a preliminary study employing Rosetta’s proprietary technologies indicate promising immune-related microRNA candidates. The current study, which will interrogate additional samples, will be used to create a microRNA-based classifier that can differentiate between PD-L1 positive and negative samples, leading to an accurate and quantitative measurement that can give support to the current complex algorithm of PD-L1 immunohistochemistry reactivity. Research in cancer immunology is currently accelerating following a series of cancer immunotherapy breakthroughs during the last five years. Various monoclonal antibodies which block the interaction between checkpoint molecules PD-1 on immune cells and PD-L1 on cancer cells have been used to successfully treat NSCLC, including some durable responses lasting years. Several drugs, including OPDIVO® (nivolumab), KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) and TECENTRIQ® (atezolizumab), are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in patients who have failed or progressed on platinum-based or targeted therapies. Importantly, KEYTRUDA is now FDA approved as a first line treatment option for patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression (Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) ≥50%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, and no prior systemic chemotherapy treatment. Despite impressive treatment outcomes in a subset of patients who receive these immune therapies, still many patients with NSCLC fail to respond to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and the identification of a biomarker to select these patients remains highly sought after. „Identifying the right patients is critical for optimizing the use of this new class of therapeutics which is transforming the care of patients with cancer who are not responding to other treatment regimens. MicroRNAs, with their high reproducibility, robustness and accuracy are well suited to provide this valuable clinical information. The preliminary studies conducted by Rosetta Genomics are encouraging and we look forward to working together to develop this important biomarker in order to optimize treatment for patients with NSCLC,” stated Dr. Gottfried. „We are excited to be collaborating with Dr. Gottfried, a renowned oncology researcher and clinician, in developing a microRNA classifier to distinguish between PD-L1 positive and negative samples in NSCLC patients as it underscores our leadership position in the development of microRNA-based biomarkers. We expect this study will build on and support our earlier work with other researchers that suggests microRNAs can be better predictors of response to immuno-oncology drugs than other biomarkers currently being utilized to predict response,” noted Kenneth A. Berlin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Rosetta Genomics. „Importantly, the development of a microRNA signature for PD-L1 can be transformational for patients, providers and payers and would be useful both in the drug development setting as well as in the clinical setting thus presenting two avenues for generating revenues.” OPDIVO® is a registered trademark of Bristol-Myers Squibb, KEYTRUDA® is a registered trademark of Merck & Co. and TECENTRIQ® is a registered trademark of Genentech USA, a member of the Roche Group. About Rosetta Genomics Rosetta is pioneering the field of molecular diagnostics by offering rapid and accurate diagnostic information that enables physicians to make more timely and informed treatment decisions to improve patient care. Rosetta has developed a portfolio of unique diagnostic solutions for oncologists, urologists, endocrinologists, cytopathologists and other specialists to help them deliver better care to their patients.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 23 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Antidepressants Market is Expected to Witness Dynamic Growth in Future!! Antidepressants are drugs used for the treatment of depressive disorders including dysthymia, obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety, chronic pain, eating disorders, and neuropathic pain. Depression is a medical disorder which is related to the brain. Symptoms of depression include feeling sad and tired, lacking energy, and having difficulty enjoying routine daily activities. According to CDC, depression affects about 1 in every 5 individuals in the U.S. According to WHO (World Health Organization), at present an estimated 350 million people worldwide are affected by depression. Depression affects 10% to 15% men and about 10% to 25% of women. Obtain Report Details: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/antidepressants-market… The antidepressants market has been segmented based on the drug classes commonly used for the treatment of various types of depressive disorders. There are different types of antidepressant drugs available in the market such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (RIMA), tetracyclic antidepressants, etc. The different types of antidepressants are used in the treatment of depressive disorders. The different classes of antidepressants are as effective as each other, but some patients respond better to one antidepressant compared to another antidepressant. Side effects can also be different between these groups of antidepressants. Different types of depression disorders include dysthymic disorder, postpartum depression, psychotic depression, major or clinical depressive disorder, and seasonal affective disorder. Factors driving the antidepressants market are declining side effects and rising efficacy of drugs in various classes as well as growing geriatric population where rate of mental illness is higher. However, the overall antidepressants market growth would decrease due to patent expiry of key antidepressants, fragile pipeline of new drugs, increasing number of generic drug alternatives, and growing prevalence of treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders. Region wise, the global fermented ingredients market is segmented into five regions; North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East & Africa. North America is the most dominant market for antidepressants due to the presence of a large patient population suffering from various types of anxiety disorders and depression. However, the antidepressants market in the U.S. is currently saturated, as several antidepressant drugs are available on prescription for the same indication. Hence, the future growth of the market would depend on introduction of efficacious drugs for new indications. Moreover, loss of patent exclusivity, market maturity, generic infiltration, and shortened drug lifecycles are the additional factors that contribute to the decline in market growth in the region. Asia Pacific is expected to witness appreciable growth due to multiple factors such as high prevalence of psychiatric disorders and rapid economic growth in countries such as China, Japan, and Australia. Additionally, positive marketing approval for innovative medicines is likely to drive the market in the near future. Fill the form for an exclusive sample of this report: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Currently, the market is highly fragmented and competitive in nature due to the involvement of both large and small pharmaceutical companies. AstraZeneca plc, Eli Lilly and Company, Forest Laboratories, GlaxoSmithKline plc, H. Lundbeck A/S, Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Co., Inc., Pfizer, Inc. and Sanofi S.A. are major companies operating in the antidepressants market. Majority of the market players are focusing on expanding distribution network as well as expanding geographical presence, as Asia Pacific, the Middle East& Africa, and Latin America are developing regions with an increasing prevalence of various types of depressive disorders and improving economic conditions. Differences in clinical efficacy between drugs are generally small because most modern antidepressants work through a common biological mechanism. As a result, drug makers use direct-to-consumer advertising and tweak side effect profiles in order to differentiate their products. The report offers a comprehensive evaluation of the market. It does so via in-depth qualitative insights, historical data, and verifiable projections about market size. The projections featured in the report have been derived using proven research methodologies and assumptions. By doing so, the research report serves as a repository of analysis and information for every facet of the market, including but not limited to: Regional markets, technology, types, and applications.

These promising results have encouraged ORYX to prepare a controlled clinical study, which will be discussed with regulatory authorities. Seven patients suffering from glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) who had experienced a second relapse following treatment with ParvOryx in a completed Phase I/IIa study were treated with ParvOryx plus Avastin(R) following surgery. In the seven ParvOryx/Avastin(R)-treated patients, median overall survival (mOS) was prolonged to 25.9 months compared to the ParvOryx monotherapy study mOS (15.9 months). Additionally, nine GBM patients with either primary, diffuse primary, single recurrent or double recurrent GBM were treated with ParvOryx in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor alone (1) or in combination with Avastin [(R)] and an immune checkpoint inhibitor (8) without prior surgery. All nine patients responded with objective tumor regression already after 6-8 weeks. The tumor load was reduced by 45-96% as measured by RANO (Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology) criteria. Follow-up is ongoing. Two patients relapsed (26 and 47 weeks) after virotherapy, while receiving constant treatment with Avastin(R) and an immune checkpoint inhibitor. Treatment with ParvOryx together with the resumption of combination therapy with Avastin(R) and the checkpoint inhibitor led to rapid regression of the tumor mass and disease control. Dr. Michael Dahm, ORYX's Chief Medical Officer, said: "Although these data are preliminary and uncontrolled, they are highly encouraging. We look forward to evaluating ParvOryx in combination with Avastin(R) or with Avastin(R) plus an immune checkpoint inhibitor in a controlled clinical trial setting." About ParvOryx ParvOryx (Parvovirus H1) is a wild type rat oncolytic virus that infects and lyses tumor cells in a wide variety of cancers, including glioblastoma multiforme, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, lymphoma, pediatric tumors such as neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma, prostate cancer and renal cancer, as well as tumor stem cells. ParvOryx (parvus), the smallest among all oncolytic viruses, is able to pass the blood brain barrier. The special properties of ParvOryx allow for both intratumoral and intravenous administration as well as repeated application (boosters). Unlike other natural or modified oncolytic viruses currently under investigation, H-1PV does not affect normal cells and is not pathogenic for humans. The virus exerts a cytotoxic/oncolytic effect, resulting in dysregulation of cell transcription, cell cycle arrest, shut off of cell replication, activation of cellular stress response and induction of cell death. In addition, viral oncolysis induces a strong tumor-specific immune response leading to the recognition and elimination of minimal residual disease (bystander effect). ParvOryx can turn an immunogenic "cold" into a "hot" tumor by profoundly changing its microenvironment, making the tumor vulnerable to a variety of immuno-oncological approaches. ParvOryx successfully completed a Phase I/IIa trial to treat glioblastoma multiforme in 18 patients with recurrent or progressive disease. A dose-escalation Phase I/IIa pilot study for the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer with ParvOryx monotherapy is currently ongoing, with topline data expected in Q4 2017. About ORYX ORYX is a privately held Munich-based biotech company. ORYX is developing three highly innovative drug candidates for the treatment of cancer, originating from leading research institutions like the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and the University of Heidelberg.

ParvOryx (parvus), the smallest among all oncolytic viruses, is able to pass the blood brain barrier. The special properties of ParvOryx allow for both intratumoral and intravenous administration as well as repeated application (boosters). Unlike other natural or modified oncolytic viruses currently under investigation, H-1PV does not affect normal cells and is not pathogenic for humans. The virus exerts a cytotoxic/oncolytic effect, resulting in dysregulation of cell transcription, cell cycle arrest, shut off of cell replication, activation of cellular stress response and induction of cell death. In addition, viral oncolysis induces a strong tumor-specific immune response leading to the recognition and elimination of minimal residual disease (bystander effect). ParvOryx can turn an immunogenic "cold" into a "hot" tumor by profoundly changing its microenvironment, making the tumor vulnerable to a variety of immuno-oncological approaches. ParvOryx successfully completed a Phase I/IIa trial to treat glioblastoma multiforme in 18 patients with recurrent or progressive disease. A dose-escalation Phase I/IIa pilot study for the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer with ParvOryx monotherapy is currently ongoing, with topline data expected in Q4 2017. *About ORYX* ORYX is a privately held Munich-based biotech company. ORYX is developing three highly innovative drug candidates for the treatment of cancer, originating from leading research institutions like the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and the University of Heidelberg. The ORYX clinical development portfolio consists of an oncolytic virus and two therapeutic cancer vaccines. ORYX holds exclusive, worldwide licenses for all its development projects.

The length of treatment depends on what type of fungal infection you have, how severe it is and if you have any other health problems – for example, problems with your immune system.

Asia Pacific is likely to emerge as a promising market during the same period owing to the increasing prevalence of communicable diseases, particularly in developing countries such as India.

Administration 23 May, 2017, 16:14 ET Share this article SILVER SPRING, Md., May 23, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today granted accelerated approval to a treatment for patients whose cancers have a specific genetic feature (biomarker). This is the first time the agency has approved a cancer treatment based on a common biomarker rather than the location in the body where the tumor originated. Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors that have been identified as having a biomarker referred to as microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). This indication covers patients with solid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options and patients with colorectal cancer that has progressed following treatment with certain chemotherapy drugs. "This is an important first for the cancer community," said Richard Pazdur, M.D., acting director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and director of the FDA's Oncology Center of Excellence. "Until now, the FDA has approved cancer treatments based on where in the body the cancer started—for example, lung or breast cancers. We have now approved a drug based on a tumor's biomarker without regard to the tumor's original location." MSI-H and dMMR tumors contain abnormalities that affect the proper repair of DNA inside the cell. Tumors with these biomarkers are most commonly found in colorectal, endometrial and gastrointestinal cancers, but also less commonly appear in cancers arising in the breast, prostate, bladder, thyroid gland and other places. Approximately 5 percent of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer have MSI-H or dMMR tumors. Keytruda works by targeting the cellular pathway known as PD-1/PD-L1 (proteins found on the body's immune cells and some cancer cells). By blocking this pathway, Keytruda may help the body's immune system fight the cancer cells. The FDA previously approved Keytruda for the treatment of certain patients with metastatic melanoma, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer, refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and urothelial carcinoma. Keytruda was approved for this new indication using the Accelerated Approval pathway, under which the FDA may approve drugs for serious conditions where there is unmet medical need and a drug is shown to have certain effects that are reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit to patients. Further study is required to verify and describe anticipated clinical benefits of Keytruda, and the sponsor is currently conducting these studies in additional patients with MSI-H or dMMR tumors. The safety and efficacy of Keytruda for this indication were studied in patients with MSI-H or dMMR solid tumors enrolled in one of five uncontrolled, single-arm clinical trials. In some trials, patients were required to have MSI-H or dMMR cancers, while in other trials, a subgroup of patients were identified as having MSI-H or dMMR cancers by testing tumor samples after treatment began. A total of 15 cancer types were identified among 149 patients enrolled across these five clinical trials. The most common cancers were colorectal, endometrial and other gastrointestinal cancers. The review of Keytruda for this indication was based on the percentage of patients who experienced complete or partial shrinkage of their tumors (overall response rate) and for how long (durability of response). Of the 149 patients who received Keytruda in the trials, 39.6 percent had a complete or partial response. For 78 percent of those patients, the response lasted for six months or more. Common side effects of Keytruda include fatigue, itchy skin (pruritus), diarrhea, decreased appetite, rash, fever (pyrexia), cough, difficulty breathing (dyspnea), musculoskeletal pain, constipation and nausea. Keytruda can cause serious conditions known as immune-mediated side effects, including inflammation of healthy organs such as the lungs (pneumonitis), colon (colitis), liver (hepatitis), endocrine glands (endocrinopathies) and kidneys (nephritis). Complications or death related to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation after using Keytruda has occurred. Patients who experience severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions should stop taking Keytruda. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take Keytruda because it may cause harm to a developing fetus or newborn baby. The safety and effectiveness of Keytruda in pediatric patients with MSI-H central nervous system cancers have not been established. The FDA granted this application Priority Review designation, under which the FDA's goal is to take action on an application within six months where the agency determines that the drug, if approved, would significantly improve the safety or effectiveness of treating, diagnosing or preventing a serious condition. The FDA granted accelerated approval of Keytruda to Merck & Co.

Browse the full report Peripheral Neuropathy Market – Growth, Future Prospects and Competitive Analysis, and Forecast, 2017 – 2025 report at http://www.credenceresearch.com/report/peripheral-neuropathy-market Market Insights Peripheral neuropathy mainly causes due to damage occurred to peripheral nerves resulting in weakness, numbness, and usually in hands and feet. Peripheral neuropathy is caused due to traumatic injuries, infections, metabolic problems, inherited causes and exposure to toxins, and most commonly by diabetes mellitus. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it was estimated that there would be 285 million diabetics by 2010 in the world. This estimate is projected to increase by 65% to become 438 million in the year 2030. Thus, rising prevalence of diabetes mellitus is expected to increase the population of patients suffering from peripheral neuropathy. With a limited number of prescription drugs available for neuropathic pain, off-label prescription of several other drugs is widespread. The pharma industry has been struggling to further improve the currently available therapeutic options due to the complexity of identification of the most suitable targets for investigation. Recently, there has been a shift towards the adoption of transdermal therapies for the management of neuropathic pain. The complete report is available at http://www.credenceresearch.com/report/peripheral-neuropathy-market The global peripheral neuropathy market is segmented by treatment type as pharmacological therapies and non-pharmacological therapies. Pharmacological therapies includes pain killers, anti-seizures medication, antidepressants. Non pharmacological therapies include transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, plasma exchange and intravenous immune globulin and others (physical therapy and surgery). Pharmacological therapies most commonly used and dominates the peripheral neuropathy market, while non-pharmacological therapies are used along with other treatment options. In the base 2016, North America was observed as the largest market for peripheral neuropathy. The rising geriatric population, growing incidences of diabetes in the region is the prime factor driving the North America peripheral neuropathy market. Asia Pacific is anticipated to be fastest growing market for the forecast period 2017-2025. Market Competition Assessment: Key players in the global peripheral neuropathy market are Abbott Laboratories, Bristol Myers Squibb, Cipla Limited, Eli Lilly and Company, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Lupin Limited, Merck and Co. Inc., Novartis, Pfizer Inc, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Key Market Movements: Prediabetes and diabetes both are becoming a bigger problem and as a consequence more and more patients are anticipated to suffer from peripheral pain. As the prevalence of this condition persists to grow, the demand for treatment for peripheral neuropathy will also correspondingly increase. Non-pharmacologic treatments of neuropathic pain are usually begun simultaneously with pharmacologic regimen. It is reported through various studies that reference for non-pharmacologic methods for neuropathic pain management is on a perpetual rise.

These data and conclusions should be considered to be preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. People ages 40 and up who smoked marijuana, along with cigarettes or without them, appeared to increase their risk of lung exacerbation-like illnesses. Note that the study suggests that marijuana use is not innocuous when it comes to lung disease, and that tobacco smoking, alone or together with marijuana, are risk factors for increased chronic respiratory symptoms. WASHINGTON -- People ages 40 and up who smoked marijuana, along with cigarettes or without them, appeared to increase their risk of lung exacerbation-like illnesses, researchers reported here. In the Canadian Obstructive Lung Disease (COLD) study of 5,106 adults over age 40, about 17% of people with an average age of about 60 who never smoked experienced respiratory exacerbation-like events in the past years compared with 19.3% of individuals who were classified as having a history of smoking cigarettes; 23.9% of people having smoked only marijuana; and 24.2% of people who smoked both marijuana and cigarettes, according to Wan Tan, MD, of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, and colleagues. In the Canadian Cohort of Obstructive Lung Disease (CanCOLD) study of 1.168 adults, 17.3% of never smokers experienced exacerbations compared with 26.4% of smokers, 33.3% of marijuana smokers, and 35.9% of marijuana and tobacco smokers, Tan told MedPage Today at the American Thoracic Society meeting. In the COLD study, the difference between the dual smokers and never smokers was statistically significant (P<0.0001) and the difference was also significant between dual smokers and those who smoked marijuana only (P<0.0001), she reported. In the CanCOLD study, the difference was significant between dual smokers and never smokers (P<0.0001) and between dual smokers and never smokers (P<0.0001). The small numbers of marijuana smokers (27) in CanCOLD made statistical analysis difficult, she noted. "The bottom line here is: Marijuana use is not innocuous when it comes to lung disease," Tan said. "Tobacco smoking -- defined as a lifetime use of more than 365 cigarettes -- alone or together with marijuana -- defined as 50 joints or more in a lifetime -- are risk factors for increased chronic respiratory symptoms." "Dual smoking or tobacco or marijuana synergistically increase risks for symptoms and exacerbations," she noted. Tan pointed out that tobacco smokers were significantly more likely to experience chronic cough, chronic phlegm, wheeze, dyspnea, and sever dyspnea. Marijuana smokers were only significantly more like than non-smokers to experience wheezing, although they tended to have more chronic cough, more chronic phlegm, and more overall dyspnea. People with both marijuana and cigarette history had more of all of the symptoms, Tan said. Specifically, compared with people who did not smoke marijuana or tobacco, increased odds for at least one exacerbation–like event in the past 1 year occurred in smokers of marijuana only (adjusted odds ratio 1.49, 95% CI 1.56-3.30) and in dual smokers of marijuana and cigarettes (aOR 1.39, 95% 1.15-1.69). Those who smoked cigarettes only also had an increased odds for exacerbation-like events (aOR 1.51, 95% CI 1.04-2.18), the authors reported. ATS session moderator George O'Connor, MD, of Boston University, commented that "Dr. Tan saw a signal for sure of a synergistic effect of smoking both marijuana and cigarettes especially as it pertains to acute chest illness. I have been telling my patients this for years." "I think we know that basically any kind of smoke ... is bad in terms of respiratory health," he told MedPage Today. "Tobacco is perhaps the worst; marijuana; even a fireplace that brings smoke into your living room. Smoke of any kind we are pretty sure is bad for you. It is just a matter of defining the risk." "Dr. Tan's work is getting us to the point where we can have quantification of the risks," he added. In the two studies, most of never smokers were women (38.7% were men) while the 53.3% who said they only used cigarettes were women. About 63% of those who only smoked marijuana were men and 61.4% of those who smoked both cigarettes and marijuana were men, Tan reported. Study participants ranged in age from 53-63. The study was funded by AstraZeneca Canada, Boehringer Ingelheim Canada, GSK Canada, Merck, Novartis, Nycomed, Pfizer Canada, and Theratechnologies. Tan and O'Connor disclosed no relevant relationships with industry.

By Maike Telgheder and Siegfried Hofmann Published on 23. May 2017, 16:36 Why it matters Why it matters The fight against antibiotic resistance demands classes of antibiotic but most major pharmaceutical companies have all but abandoned the field in favor of more profitable research. Facts Facts Antibiotics are far less profitable for pharmaceutical companies than drugs to treat chronic diseases like cancer. Antibiotics are still among the 10 largest therapy classes in the global pharmaceutical market. Major German pharmaceutical companies like Bayer and Boehringer no longer conduct antibiotic research. Audio Audio LISTEN Pdf Source: Picture alliance They claim an estimated 25,000 lives each year in the European Union alone. And that number could rise dramatically unless better drugs are developed. Pathogens that are resistant to standard antibiotics are a growing threat to global health. Politicians are pushing for stronger prevention efforts and a new burst of innovation in antibiotic development. The health ministers of the G20 nations, who met in Berlin over the weekend, warned that “progress in the research and development of new antibiotic therapies against life-threatening and highly resistant organisms is slowly drying up.” They advocate greater financial support for new research initiatives and alliances between industry and universities. Experts in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries welcome the fresh political will, but warn against hoping for quick results. The battle against bacteria is a tough one to win – mainly because of past omissions. Essential research has been neglected for far too long. Holger Zimmerman, head of Aicuris, a biotech specializing in anti-infective agents, does recognize a certain trend reversal and is cautiously optimistic. “But the important thing is that what’s now on paper actually becomes reality. We need ongoing support in this area. Otherwise it will go up in smoke.” The German Association of Research-based Pharmaceutical Companies (VfA) agrees. It sees the G20 statement as groundbreaking, but also believes further action is needed. According to VfA Managing Director Birgit Fischer, activity in the areas of epidemic vaccines and antibiotics must be “significantly expanded, so that the world community can effectively cope with future health crises.” The problem of antibiotic resistance is an indirect result of the research successes of the last century. In the 1980s and 90s, pharmaceutical companies introduced more than 40 new drugs onto the market, including many broad-spectrum antibiotics that are effective against a large number of bacteria. These drugs are now produced in huge quantities, available for a few cents, and widely used in human and veterinary medicine. That in turn promotes resistance. At the same time, there is very little commercial incentive to develop new antibiotics. The dilemma pharmaceutical companies face is that failure rates in antibiotic research are similar to those with other drugs, whereas the market potential compared to drugs that treat chronic diseases like cancer remains very modest. It makes sense that to prevent resistance, new antibiotics should only be used very restrictedly. In routine use, however, they have to compete against successful and extremely inexpensive older products. According to data from Quintiles IMS Health, antibiotics, with about $38 billion, or €34 billion, in sales, are still among the 10 largest therapy classes in the global pharmaceutical market, although sales have been declining since 2013. The market is now almost completely in the hands of generic manufacturers, which perform no research. Starting in the late 1990s, the major pharmaceutical companies largely abandoned antibiotic research to focus on more lucrative areas, such as cancer and diabetes therapy, as well as autoimmune diseases. The three leading German drug makers, Bayer, Boehringer and the Darmstadt-based Merck Group, are also no longer active in antibiotic research and, according to their own statements, have no plans to become involved in the field. Bayer spun off its anti-infective agent research 10 years ago into Aicuris, which is heavily funded by former Hexal owners Andreas and Thomas Strüngmann. “The important thing is that what's now on paper actually becomes reality. We need ongoing support in this area. Otherwise it will go up in smoke.” Holger Zimmerman, head of biotech Aicuris However, with growing research funding, there appears to be at least an uptick in activity. Several large pharmaceutical companies signed an appeal in Davos in early 2016, calling for concerted action against antibiotic resistance. And according to industry expert Marc Gitzinger, the number of smaller biotech companies in the field is growing again. Mr. Gitzinger heads Bioversys, a biotech firm based in Basel, Switzerland. He is also the deputy chairman of the Beam Alliance, a group of around 40 smaller pharmaceutical and biotech companies involved in antibiotic research. The Boston Consulting Group estimates that $500 million in grant funding for antibiotic research is now being provided annually, in the context of international and national initiatives. In a public-private partnership, the European Commission and the pharmaceutical industry launched the New Drugs 4 Bad Bugs research program in 2012. The seven-year program has received about €700 million in funding. And in 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched The Global Antibiotic Research & Development Partnership, or GARDP. Participating companies agree to supply successfully developed antibiotics to emerging and developing countries under special conditions. But experts believe further incentives are needed, in addition to direct research funding. “We need to create a certain amount of investment certainty,” Aversys CEO Gitzinger said. “The chain has to work credibly again, or else the initiatives will come to nothing.” In a study for the German health ministry, experts at BCG propose, among other things, a bonus of $1 billion for the market entry of an urgently needed antibiotic – a model that industry representatives welcome but is also seen as difficult to implement. New approvals are on the rise, however. The VfA counts 11 new antibiotics since 2011, including drugs to treat tuberculosis and the hospital bacterium MRSA. The association estimates that the number of new antibiotics could grow to 18 by the end of the decade. A tentative renaissance of antibiotic activities is also taking shape among Big Pharma, with companies like Roche and French drug maker Sanofi boosting their activities in the field. In 2014, Sanofi began an alliance with the Fraunhofer Institute, contributing its extensive collection of naturally occurring substances. US producer Merck & Co. (which has no relationship with the German Merck Group) expanded in 2014 with the acquisition of biotech company Cubist, including its bestselling drug Cubicin. Industry leader Pfizer recently acquired the antibiotics division of AstraZeneca. However, the companies were mainly interested in current business and development products that were almost ready for market. In both cases, basic research was scaled back or spun off. Experts see this as particularly troubling given the lack of new approaches to fighting pathogens. And most of the roughly four dozen projects currently in clinical development are based on known substance classes. New mechanisms are needed, especially to confront the problem of resistance. “To keep resistance at bay in the longer term, we need a lot more drugs with novel mechanisms of action, with which the pathogens are not yet familiar,” Aicuris CEO Zimmermann warned. “This is difficult but ultimately it needs to be rewarded.” Handelsblatt’s Meike Telgheder covers the pharma industry; Siegfried Hoffman also writes about the pharma and chemicals sectors.
