Vioxx, made by Merck, and Celebrex, made by Pfizer, could quell pain and inflammation just as well as drugs such as ibuprofen and naproxen, but they did not cause ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding. But then, the shocker. A Merck clinical trial asking if Vioxx could also prevent colon cancer revealed that the drug increased the risk of heart attacks, and the company pulled it off the market in 2004. Ever since, a question has hung over Celebrex. Did it cause heart attacks, too? A decade ago, the Food and Drug Administration asked Pfizer to find out. Now, at long last, the resulting clinical trial is done. Most medical researchers, including the study’s principal investigator, thought Celebrex would be riskier than either ibuprofen or naproxen. Instead, it was at least no worse and may even be safer than the alternatives. “This is definitely a striking finding,” said Dr. Michael Lauer, a cardiologist at the National Institutes of Health who was not associated with the study. An estimated 2 million people in the United States take Celebrex or generic celecoxib, said Dr. Milton Pressler, a cardiologist in charge of clinical affairs for Pfizer Essential Health. The drug is available only by prescription; as the trial dragged on, its patent expired, so now generic companies also sell it. The study involved 24,000 people with arthritis who were at high risk for heart disease or already had it. A third of them were randomly assigned to take Celebrex, a third to take naproxen and a third to take ibuprofen. The doses were equivalent and neither the participants nor the investigators knew who was taking what. The results were published Sunday online in the New England Journal of Medicine to coincide with a presentation at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association by Dr. Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic, who directed the new study. He and others emphasized that the findings only apply to people taking the drugs every day for months or years and who are at high risk for heart disease or already have it. They do not apply to someone who pops an occasional ibuprofen such as Advil for a pulled muscle or takes a naproxen such as Aleve for a headache. When the trial was designed, many thought, based on data from small studies, that naproxen was safest and celecoxib was likely to be the most risky. In fact, said Susan Ellenberg, a biostatistician at the University of Pennsylvania, some at the FDA wanted to label naproxen as being safest. But an advisory committee that met in 2015 said to wait for the results of the new trial and warned that none of the drugs were risk-free. The FDA declined to comment on the outcome of the study. Dr. Michael Joseph Blaha, director of clinical research for the Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease, said many of his heart patients also have arthritis. “This is a common question that people have: Is it safe to take these drugs?” said Dr. Blaha, who was not associated with the new study. The main purpose of the study was to investigate “noninferiority” — to see if celecoxib was at least as safe as the other two drugs. It was. Yet major questions remain, said Dr. Peter W.F. Wilson, of the Emory Clinical Cardiovascular Research Institute. There was no placebo, which made it hard to pick up an increase in heart risk if it occurs with all the drugs. Pfizer is now “sifting through more than 3 million pages of data and putting together a comprehensive report” to send to the FDA, Dr. Pressler said. Then, he said, it will be up to the agency to decide what changes, if any, should be made to the drug’s label, which currently warns against heart and gastrointestinal effects. The study found that, during the trial, 188 of the celecoxib patients (2.3 percent) died of heart disease or hemorrhage, or had a heart attack or a stroke, compared with 201 patients taking naproxen (2.5 percent) and 218 patients (2.7 percent) taking ibuprofen. The real surprise was in other outcomes the study investigated. Significantly more patients taking ibuprofen had worsening kidney function. Patients taking either ibuprofen or naproxen were significantly more likely to be hospitalized for high blood pressure. And despite the assumption that naproxen was the safest, there were 25 percent more total deaths with naproxen than celecoxib — 163 with naproxen compared with 132 with celecoxib. As expected, because celecoxib was intended to avoid bleeding problems, both ibuprofen and naproxen patients had significantly more gastrointestinal bleeding and ulcers. These other outcomes were not the primary focus of the study and could not be considered proof of harm, though did warrant further study, Dr. Nissen emphasized. Dr. Wilson took issue with stressing the secondary outcomes. The rules of clinical trial research say what counts is the outcome you designed your study to find. “To then drill into secondary endpoints and find superiority — that’s not really fair,” he said. Pfizer paid for the study — one of the largest it has ever done, Dr. Pressler said — but to avoid conflicts of interest, members of the study’s executive committee, who all were academic researchers, agreed to not accept payments from any maker of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the duration of the trial. The study did have some real weaknesses, said Dr. Elliott M. Antman, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a past president of the American Heart Association. Only a minority of the patients actually had documented heart disease, and it is those patients who are most worrisome. Many dropped out, making it hard to interpret the data. “They asked an important question, but the trial was hard to complete,” he said. The weaknesses of the study made him unable to be confident of its conclusions. Still, he said, “this is the best we will get,” adding “we will probably never see another study like this.” Dr. Antman said he would continue to advise that any of these drugs be taken only by the lowest-risk patients in the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time. Others, like Dr. Blaha, accepted the conclusions. “I would not feel comfortable saying it is perfectly safe to take celecoxib,” he said. “But if you need to take a daily pill, it might be safer to take this one than the other two.” The study, he said, convinced him to change his practice. “On average it looks like celecoxib is safer,” he said. “If you need to be on it for more than a couple of months, I would think strongly about celecoxib.” Sign up for free newsletters and get more of the Post-Gazette delivered to your inbox Most Read Most Emailed Advertisement Most Commented Your e-mail: Your Name: Friends e-mail: Friends Name: Message: Captcha Submit Advertisement Create a free PG account.

You’ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You’re all set! Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Lenny Bernstein November 13 Follow @LennyMBernstein (iStock) In 2004, when drugmaker Merck voluntarily pulled the pain-reliever Vioxx off the market amid evidence that it increased the risk of heart attacks, concern naturally turned to its nearly identical rival, Celebrex. The medication works the same way, by inhibiting production of an enzyme that causes pain and inflammation — as do naproxen, ibuprofen and others in the class of widely used analgesics known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). Now the first large-scale study of the three drugs finds that Celebrex poses no greater risk of heart attack, stroke, other cardiovascular problems or death than naproxen or ibuprofen. More surprisingly, says Steven E. Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic, who led the nearly decade-long international research, there is evidence that Celebrex is less likely than the other two to cause  kidney and gastrointestinal problems associated with NSAIDS. “Do I think there’s a difference between these three drugs?” Nissen asked. “The answer is yes.” [How drugs intended for legitimate pain patients found their way to the black market] That statement may be more controversial than it sounds, because so many people take NSAIDS by prescription and via over-the-counter products such as Advil and Motrin. “Everyone on the planet takes these drugs,” he said. In the United States, about 70 percent of people ages 65 and older take NSAIDS once a week, with half of them taking at least seven doses each week, according to a 2013 study in the American Journal of Managed Care. More than 100 million prescriptions are written for the drugs each year in this country. But Nissen and other experts were quick to point out that the new findings are not easily applied to people using over-the-counter pain relief. The more than 24,000 participants in the study all had painful arthritis and elevated risk for cardiovascular problems. More importantly, they were given significantly higher doses of the three drugs than are found in over-the-counter versions. Nevertheless, the results may cause some people to reconsider NSAID pain relievers, especially those who take them frequently and in doses larger than the amounts recommended in over-the-counter formulations, Nissen said. [Pfizer agrees to truth in opioid marketing] “If you have pain that is sufficiently severe that you need these drugs to function, you should weigh the benefits of relieving pain versus the potential hazards,” he said. He and others said that users should take the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible time to avoid side effects. The study had a number of shortcomings. More than 27 percent of the participants left the trial before researchers could determine whether they had suffered any side effect, and more than 68 percent at some point discontinued their use of celecoxib, the generic version of Celebrex that was tested. Both developments are to be expected in research that involves people in pain, but the proportions are very large, said Colin Baigent, director of the Medical Research Council population health research unit at England’s Oxford University. In addition, Baigent said, the daily 200-milligram dose of celecoxib given to participants because of some countries’ health regulations is lower than the amount many people in other studies have received — which would tend to limit cardiovascular side effects. Previous research has shown that complications increase along with dosage, he said. [I had a big pain in the neck. Then I ate a bunch of tart cherries] Yet Baigent and Carlo Patrono, a professor of pharmacology at the Catholic University School of Medicine in Rome, said the study confirms conclusions they reached in an analysis of previous research and adds some significant new data. “It does not provide any surprises,” Patrono said. The study, which was mandated by the Food and Drug Administration after Vioxx’s withdrawal, was released Sunday at a meeting of the American Heart Association and in the New England Journal of Medicine. It was funded by Pfizer, which makes Celebrex and other NSAIDs, but numerous precautions were taken to preserve the researchers’ independence, Nissen said. An FDA spokeswoman said the agency would not comment on the results. Milton Pressler, vice president and head of clinical affairs for Pfizer, said the company is “pleased to have these results after many years” of waiting for the trial to conclude. The company also makes the Advil brand of over-the-counter ibuprofen, but Pressler said the results cannot be applied to that product because of the study’s much higher doses of ibuprofen, which were given for an average of 20 months. Similarly, Johnson & Johnson, which makes Motrin, said in a statement that “the study evaluated ibuprofen at doses and duration greater than the over-the-counter Motrin products sold in the U.S. … Consumers should always read and follow the label and talk to their health care professional if they have questions or health concerns.” The research looked at 24,081 people with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis at 926 medical centers in 13 countries between 2006 and 2014. About a third were given 100 milligrams of celecoxib twice a day, a third took 600 milligrams of ibuprofen three times a day and the rest took 375 milligrams of naproxen twice a day. Some patients with rheumatoid arthritis received higher doses. All had risks such as previous heart attacks or diabetes. Patients on celecoxib fared no worse than those taking naproxen or ibuprofen when most cardiovascular complications were tallied. And they suffered significantly fewer serious kidney problems and hospitalizations for hypertension than those taking ibuprofen. They also experienced fewer gastrointestinal complications than patients in the other two groups. national health-science to-your-health Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

The study of arthritis sufferers is likely to raise eyebrows, given long-held concerns about Celebrex. Some 100 million prescriptions were written in the United States in 2013 alone for the type of painkiller known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDS, to which all three drugs belong. Celebrex, or celecoxib, belongs to a class of NSAID called Cox-2 inhibitors that were designed to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding common with many NSAIDs. The primary goal of the 24,000-patient trial was to demonstrate that Celebrex did not cause an increased risk of serious heart problems compared with the other two drugs. The main measures of heart attack, stroke or death occurred between 2 percent and 3 percent of patients for all three medicines, a statistically significant result for non-inferiority. "I think it's incontrovertible that celecoxib is not worse than these older NSAIDS," said Dr. Steven Nissen, the study's lead investigator. U.S. regulators ordered the study after pulling Merck & Co's blockbuster pain drug Vioxx from the market for causing heart attacks and deaths, leading many in the medical community to assume that the entire class of Cox-2 inhibitors was similarly tainted. Merck at one point offered the theory that naproxen, to which Vioxx was compared in studies, protected the heart. "Everybody thought: 'Oh, naproxen is the safest; Celebrex is probably like Vioxx,'" said Nissen, chief of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic, who presented the data at the American Heart Association's scientific meeting in New Orleans. "Everybody thought they knew the answer, and the entire world was wrong." Annual sales of Celebrex, which is now off patent, have declined to about $775 million for Pfizer. The drug is available as a generic from many companies, including Mylan NV and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. Celebrex sales were about $3 billion in 2014 and could have been far higher but for safety concerns. In 2005, U.S. regulators ordered Pfizer to withdraw another Cox-2 pain drug, Bextra, over a host of safety issues and added a safety warning to the Celebrex label. Naproxen is the active ingredient in Bayer AG's Aleve, while ibuprofen is the main component of Pfizer's Advil. The older drugs in the study were taken at higher doses and for far longer than the recommendations for the over-the-counter versions. Researchers stressed that safety issues seen in the study should not lead to conclusions about occasional use of the OTC products. Cardiology researchers also said it was unclear how these results might affect prescribing habits of the primary care doctors who most often treat arthritis patients. Patients in the study took the drugs for 20 months on average and were followed for another 14 months. But 27 percent of those enrolled dropped out. Researchers said many chronic pain patients seek additional or alternative therapy. On some secondary measures of the study, Celebrex actually fared better. Death for any reason was 25 percent higher with naproxen than Celebrex, although that did not quite reach statistical significance, while kidney problems were 64 percent higher with ibuprofen than Celebrex. "I was completely surprised at the excess of renal toxicity with ibuprofen," Nissen said. There was also a significant excess of gastrointestinal problems with ibuprofen and naproxen, such as severe anemia likely due to internal bleeding. Dr. Elliott Antman, a past AHA president who critiqued the study, noted several limitations, including that those taking ibuprofen or naproxen were allowed to increase their dosage but not the Celebrex group. He called for a much more detailed analysis of the data. Dr. Clyde Yancy, another past AHA president who also was not involved in the study, cited a need for better drugs. "Clearly we need an additional therapeutic option for patients who have known cardiovascular disease and a chronic pain syndrome," he said. Available therapies have enough limitations "that we're not where we need to be."

The president-elect has pledged to cut corporation tax for American companies and suggested that he could allow businesses to repatriate money earned overseas back into the US without having to pay hefty fines. “With the Republicans in control of the White House and both houses of Congress, the ability to adjust tax rates has increased significantly,” said Paul Cuddon, a healthcare analyst at Numis Securities. “The reasons why mega mergers were hot over the last two years was partly because US companies wanted to make tax savings, but if US rates become more competitive internationally and pharma companies are able to bring money in from offshore, you could see a return to mega mergers as companies awash with cash look to boost their pipeline and save costs.” Such policies would be a massive boon for the likes of Merck, Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer, which have tens of billions of dollars stashed overseas and are stuck paying high rates of corporation tax. Donald Trump FTSE “Even if they could get a tax break on say 10pc of repatriated earnings, it will go straight to the bottom line and in the US, when companies have cash, they tend to spend it,” said Ketan Patel, a fund manager at EdenTree Investment Management. Pfizer, in particular, needs acquisitions to boost it ageing pipeline, and flush with money, it could opt for a major acquisition.  Mick Cooper, an pharma specialist at Trinity Delta, said: “One reason Pfizer went after AstraZeneca was because it had a load of cash offshore, so in that sense there are definitely benefits for big pharma to Trump.” Overall, pharmaceutical and biotech stocks reacted positively to news that Donald Trump would be the next president, rather than Hillary Clinton, whose vociferous rehtoric on “price-goughing” was a major concern for the industry. Although his policies are less clear, Trump does advocate more price transparency in healthcare and a free-market approach to the sector. “He is pro-business fundamentally and pro-competition,” said Dr David Cox, of Panmure Gordon. “Pricing will still be an issue for the industry, but it will be less in the headlines than it would have been under Clinton.” Mr Trump has floated the idea of allowing health insurance to be bought and sold across state lines, which would increase competition and lower prices. Ironically, this is effectively what Obamacare does - a programme that Mr Trump has criticised heavily and promised to scrap. The future president has also suggested he wants to allow cheap generic drugs and other high-price medications to be imported from abroad where they are cheaper. This is called the 'parallel market’ and is currently restricted under US regulations. “I don’t think he will put pressure on innovative R&D driven companies,” said Dr Cox. “It’s more on the generic side I see him taking action. "What Trump is saying is that big pharma can do what they like, but in competition with each other, and that the American people will pay the fairest price.” Accordingly, generic drug makers, such as Mylan, Teva and UK-listed Hikma, could find they have a more difficult time. “I wouldn’t be investing heavily in generic companies,” Dr Cox added. “The safest stocks in pharma will be innovative players.” In brief | What Trump has promised to do on his first day in office Follow Telegraph Business READ MORE ABOUT: Health Health insurance Industry Drugs AstraZeneca Biotech Republicans Hillary Clinton Donald Trump Show more Business latest 15 Nov 2016, 5:24pm Italian growth overtakes Germany as the eurozone’s core slows down  01:46 15 Nov 2016, 5:24pm Pound edges back above $1.24 as Mark Carney calls attacks on central bankers a 'massive blame-deflection exercise' 15 Nov 2016, 5:03pm John Lewis sends perfect Christmas gift to long-suffering Twitter user John Lewis 15 Nov 2016, 4:51pm B&M bullish on store roll-outs despite sterling slump 15 Nov 2016, 4:45pm Wembley developer secures £800m loan from North American funds 15 Nov 2016, 4:09pm Revealed: where to move in the UK if you want to make your salary stretch further  15 Nov 2016, 3:15pm FirstGroup riding high on the dollar as its US businesses drive growth 01:15 15 Nov 2016, 3:01pm What date is Black Friday 2016?

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Alnylam Pharmaceuticals and The Medicines Company Announce Publication of Phase 1 Clinical Data with Inclisiran (ALN- PCSsc) in the New England Journal of Medicine Interim Results from ORION-1 Phase 2 Study of Inclisiran to be Presented in Late-Breaking Clinical Trial Session at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions on November 15, 2016 CAMBRIDGE, Mass. & PARSIPANY, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:ALNY), the leading RNAi therapeutics company, and The Medicines Company (Nasdaq:MDCO), a leading biopharmaceutical development and cardiovascular product company, today announced that results from the Phase 1 study of inclisiran (in-CLEE-si-ran), the recommended International Nonproprietary Name (INN) for ALN-PCSsc, were published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Inclisiran is an investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting PCSK9 – a genetically validated protein regulator of LDL receptor metabolism – being developed for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. The paper can be found online here. Results from the study showed doses ≥300 mg (single or multiple doses) significantly reduced PCSK9 and LDL cholesterol for at least 6 months. Moreover, inclisiran was found to be generally well tolerated. “The published findings from our Phase 1 trial with inclisiran add to the clinical evidence supporting PCSK9 as a therapeutic target for significantly lowering LDL cholesterol, as well as the ability of RNAi therapeutic candidates to inhibit synthesis of liver-derived target proteins in a potent and durable manner,” said Akshay Vaishnaw, M.D., Ph.D., Executive Vice President of R&D and Chief Medical Officer of Alnylam. “We believe that inclisiran represents an innovative and differentiated approach for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.” Inclisiran is currently being studied in the ORION-1 Phase 2 study by The Medicines Company. With more than 500 patients enrolled, ORION-1 is the largest study of a GalNAc-siRNA conjugate to date. The Medicines Company recently announced positive top-line results from the day 90 interim analysis of the Phase 2 study demonstrating significant and durable LDL-C reduction that validates the potential for a triannual or biannual dosing regimen. Top-line results also showed that inclisiran was generally well tolerated, with no evidence of drug-related elevations of liver enzymes, neuropathy adverse events, or changes in renal function. The Medicines Company plans to present complete interim results from the ongoing study in a Late-Breaking Clinical Trial Session at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions on November 15, 2016. “We look forward to presenting the interim results of the ORION-1 Phase 2 data at AHA this week including Day 90 follow-up results for all 501 patients and a preliminary analysis of Day 180 follow-up for up to 200 patients,” said David Kallend, MBBS, Vice President and Global Medical Director at The Medicines Company. “Based on the strong results from the Phase 1 study, we hope to further elucidate the hypothesis of triannual or biannual dosing of inclisiran with the ORION-1 results.” The NEJM publication highlights key results from the Phase 1 clinical trial of inclisiran, including safety and pharmacodynamic measures (PCSK9, LDL cholesterol, exploratory lipid parameters). In the single-ascending-dose (SAD) phase, pharmacodynamic measures showed: Doses ≥300 mg reduced PCSK9 at day 84 (up to a least-squares mean (LSM) reduction of 74.5%); Doses ≥100 mg reduced LDL cholesterol at day 84 (up to a LSM reduction of 50.6%); Reductions in PCSK9 and LDL cholesterol were maintained at day 180 with little variation over the 6-month period for doses ≥300 mg. In the multiple-dose (MD) phase, pharmacodynamic measures showed: Reduced PCSK9 (up to a LSM reduction of 83.8%) and LDL cholesterol (up to a LSM reduction of 59.7%) at day 84; Levels of PCSK9 and LDL cholesterol remained reduced in all the inclisiran cohorts at day 196. Safety and side effect profile evaluations showed: Inclisiran was generally well tolerated following single and multiple subcutaneous dose administration; No serious adverse events (SAEs) or discontinuations due to AEs were reported; All observed adverse events (AEs) were mild or moderate in severity; There was one Grade 3 GGT elevation considered related to statin therapy. The lead development responsibility for inclisiran transitioned from Alnylam to The Medicines Company in August 2015. The two companies are now working to advance inclisiran in the ORION development program, a comprehensive global clinical development plan designed to support regulatory approval and market access worldwide. About the Inclisiran Phase 1 Study The Phase 1 trial of inclisiran was conducted in the U.K. as a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending- and multi-dose, subcutaneous dose-escalation study. The study enrolled 69 volunteer subjects with elevated baseline LDL-C (≥ 100 mg/dL), with subjects randomized 3:1, drug: placebo. The study was performed in two phases: a single ascending dose (SAD) phase and a multiple dose (MD) phase. The MD phase also included subjects both on and off stable doses of statin co-medication. The primary objective of the Phase 1 study was to evaluate the safety, side effect profile, and pharmacodynamics effects of inclisiran. About Hypercholesterolemia Hypercholesterolemia is a condition characterized by very high levels of cholesterol in the blood which is known to increase the risk of coronary artery disease, the leading cause of death in the U.S. Some forms of hypercholesterolemia can be treated through dietary restrictions, lifestyle modifications (e.g., exercise and smoking cessation) and medicines such as statins. However, a large proportion of patients with hypercholesterolemia are not achieving adequate LDL-C levels with currently available therapies such as statins, including genetic familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) patients, acute coronary syndrome patients, high-risk patient populations (e.g., patients with coronary artery disease, diabetes, symptomatic carotid artery disease, etc.) and other patients that are statin intolerant. Severe forms of hypercholesterolemia are estimated to affect more than 500,000 patients worldwide, and as a result, there is a significant need for novel therapeutics to treat patients with hypercholesterolemia whose disease is inadequately managed by existing therapies. About GalNAc Conjugates and Enhanced Stabilization Chemistry (ESC)-GalNAc Conjugates GalNAc-siRNA conjugates are a proprietary Alnylam delivery platform and are designed to achieve targeted delivery of RNAi therapeutics to hepatocytes through uptake by the asialoglycoprotein receptor. Alnylam’s Enhanced Stabilization Chemistry (ESC)-GalNAc-conjugate technology enables subcutaneous dosing with increased potency and durability, and a wide therapeutic index. This ESC-GalNAc-conjugate delivery platform is being employed in nearly all of Alnylam’s pipeline programs, including inclisiran and several other programs in clinical development. About RNAi RNAi (RNA interference) is a revolution in biology, representing a breakthrough in understanding how genes are turned on and off in cells, and a completely new approach to drug discovery and development. Its discovery has been heralded as “a major scientific breakthrough that happens once every decade or so,” and represents one of the most promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug discovery today which was awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. RNAi is a natural process of gene silencing that occurs in organisms ranging from plants to mammals. By harnessing the natural biological process of RNAi occurring in our cells, the creation of a major new class of medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics, is on the horizon. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate RNAi and comprise Alnylam’s RNAi therapeutic platform, target the cause of diseases by potently silencing specific mRNAs, thereby preventing disease-causing proteins from being made. RNAi therapeutics have the potential to treat disease and help patients in a fundamentally new way. About Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Alnylam is a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics based on RNA interference, or RNAi. The company is leading the translation of RNAi as a new class of innovative medicines. Alnylam’s pipeline of investigational RNAi therapeutics is focused in 3 Strategic Therapeutic Areas (STArs): Genetic Medicines, with a broad pipeline of RNAi therapeutics for the treatment of rare diseases; Cardio-Metabolic Disease, with a pipeline of RNAi therapeutics toward genetically validated, liver-expressed disease targets for unmet needs in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; and Hepatic Infectious Disease, with a pipeline of RNAi therapeutics that address the major global health challenges of hepatic infectious diseases. In early 2015, Alnylam launched its “Alnylam 2020” guidance for the advancement and commercialization of RNAi therapeutics as a whole new class of innovative medicines. Specifically, by the end of 2020, Alnylam expects to achieve a company profile with 3 marketed products, 10 RNAi therapeutic clinical programs – including 4 in late stages of development – across its 3 STArs. The company’s demonstrated commitment to RNAi therapeutics has enabled it to form major alliances with leading companies including Ionis, Novartis, Roche, Takeda, Merck, Monsanto, The Medicines Company, and Sanofi Genzyme.

Skip to content Military Technologies Military Press Releases Alnylam Pharmaceuticals and The Medicines Company Announce Publication of Phase 1 Clinical Data with Inclisiran (ALN- PCSsc) in the New England Journal of Medicine CAMBRIDGE, Mass. & PARSIPANY, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:ALNY), the leading RNAi therapeutics company, and The Medicines Company (Nasdaq:MDCO), a leading biopharmaceutical development and cardiovascular product company, today announced that results from the Phase 1 study of inclisiran (in-CLEE-si-ran), the recommended International Nonproprietary Name (INN) for ALN-PCSsc, were published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Inclisiran is an investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting PCSK9 – a genetically validated protein regulator of LDL receptor metabolism – being developed for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. The paper can be found online here. Results from the study showed doses ≥300 mg (single or multiple doses) significantly reduced PCSK9 and LDL cholesterol for at least 6 months. Moreover, inclisiran was found to be generally well tolerated. “The published findings from our Phase 1 trial with inclisiran add to the clinical evidence supporting PCSK9 as a therapeutic target for significantly lowering LDL cholesterol, as well as the ability of RNAi therapeutic candidates to inhibit synthesis of liver-derived target proteins in a potent and durable manner,” said Akshay Vaishnaw, M.D., Ph.D., Executive Vice President of R&D and Chief Medical Officer of Alnylam. “We believe that inclisiran represents an innovative and differentiated approach for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.” Inclisiran is currently being studied in the ORION-1 Phase 2 study by The Medicines Company. With more than 500 patients enrolled, ORION-1 is the largest study of a GalNAc-siRNA conjugate to date. The Medicines Company recently announced positive top-line results from the day 90 interim analysis of the Phase 2 study demonstrating significant and durable LDL-C reduction that validates the potential for a triannual or biannual dosing regimen. Top-line results also showed that inclisiran was generally well tolerated, with no evidence of drug-related elevations of liver enzymes, neuropathy adverse events, or changes in renal function. The Medicines Company plans to present complete interim results from the ongoing study in a Late-Breaking Clinical Trial Session at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions on November 15, 2016. “We look forward to presenting the interim results of the ORION-1 Phase 2 data at AHA this week including Day 90 follow-up results for all 501 patients and a preliminary analysis of Day 180 follow-up for up to 200 patients,” said David Kallend, MBBS, Vice President and Global Medical Director at The Medicines Company. “Based on the strong results from the Phase 1 study, we hope to further elucidate the hypothesis of triannual or biannual dosing of inclisiran with the ORION-1 results.” The NEJM publication highlights key results from the Phase 1 clinical trial of inclisiran, including safety and pharmacodynamic measures (PCSK9, LDL cholesterol, exploratory lipid parameters). In the single-ascending-dose (SAD) phase, pharmacodynamic measures showed: Doses ≥300 mg reduced PCSK9 at day 84 (up to a least-squares mean (LSM) reduction of 74.5%); Doses ≥100 mg reduced LDL cholesterol at day 84 (up to a LSM reduction of 50.6%); Reductions in PCSK9 and LDL cholesterol were maintained at day 180 with little variation over the 6-month period for doses ≥300 mg. In the multiple-dose (MD) phase, pharmacodynamic measures showed: Reduced PCSK9 (up to a LSM reduction of 83.8%) and LDL cholesterol (up to a LSM reduction of 59.7%) at day 84; Levels of PCSK9 and LDL cholesterol remained reduced in all the inclisiran cohorts at day 196. Safety and side effect profile evaluations showed: Inclisiran was generally well tolerated following single and multiple subcutaneous dose administration; No serious adverse events (SAEs) or discontinuations due to AEs were reported; All observed adverse events (AEs) were mild or moderate in severity; There was one Grade 3 GGT elevation considered related to statin therapy. The lead development responsibility for inclisiran transitioned from Alnylam to The Medicines Company in August 2015. The two companies are now working to advance inclisiran in the ORION development program, a comprehensive global clinical development plan designed to support regulatory approval and market access worldwide. About the Inclisiran Phase 1 Study The Phase 1 trial of inclisiran was conducted in the U.K. as a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending- and multi-dose, subcutaneous dose-escalation study. The study enrolled 69 volunteer subjects with elevated baseline LDL-C (≥ 100 mg/dL), with subjects randomized 3:1, drug: placebo. The study was performed in two phases: a single ascending dose (SAD) phase and a multiple dose (MD) phase. The MD phase also included subjects both on and off stable doses of statin co-medication. The primary objective of the Phase 1 study was to evaluate the safety, side effect profile, and pharmacodynamics effects of inclisiran. About Hypercholesterolemia Hypercholesterolemia is a condition characterized by very high levels of cholesterol in the blood which is known to increase the risk of coronary artery disease, the leading cause of death in the U.S. Some forms of hypercholesterolemia can be treated through dietary restrictions, lifestyle modifications (e.g., exercise and smoking cessation) and medicines such as statins. However, a large proportion of patients with hypercholesterolemia are not achieving adequate LDL-C levels with currently available therapies such as statins, including genetic familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) patients, acute coronary syndrome patients, high-risk patient populations (e.g., patients with coronary artery disease, diabetes, symptomatic carotid artery disease, etc.) and other patients that are statin intolerant.

Photo credit: Anthony Albright/Creative Commons Drugmakers told the FDA that allowing them to share off-label information with payers would be a critical first step in redefining off-label regulations. The FDA held a two-day public hearing this week to gather information about off-label communications, after a series of lawsuits were decided in favor of the pharmaceutical industry. At the hearing, industry stakeholders agreed with concerns over supplying information not vetted by the FDA to consumers, who may not understand the limitations of the data, and doctors, who may not have the time in their busy days to determine what information is misleading. This leaves payers as a likely starting point for sharing off-label information. See also: Will drugmakers get what they're looking for at this week's FDA off-label hearing? Payers “play such a gatekeeping role with respect to patients,” said Kellie Combs, an attorney for Ropes & Gray, who testified at the hearing on behalf of the Medical Information Working Group. “There's a real interest in getting information to payers as soon as possible.” As prescribing decisions are increasingly made by health systems and formulary committees — rather than physicians — allowing drugmakers to communicate with payers about data outside of the product's label is critical, and payers' sophisticated understanding of clinical data makes them low-hanging fruit, said Michael Labson, ‎a partner at law firm Covington & Burling, and a representative of PhRMA. In addition, certain types of data, like demonstrating a drug's use in subpopulations and sharing pharmacoeconomic data, are examples of information that do not meet the FDA's criteria but are still valuable to payers, said Dr. Sandra Milligan, SVP of global regulatory affairs and clinical safety at Merck. “Truthful, competent and reliable evidence should be a part of the dialogue with healthcare decision makers,” she added. FDA officials asked a number of questions about what a regulatory framework for allowing off-label communications to payers would look like, after pharmaceutical executives brought up the need to speak with payers ahead of a drug's FDA approval and also about data that is not included on a drug's approved label. See also: 5 questions raised at the FDA's off-label hearing Coleen Klasmeier, a partner at Sidley Austin, who also represents the Medical Information Working Group, argued that there would be a benefit to payers if drugmakers were allowed to share off-label information with them. She said the lack of current regulatory guidelines on this issue “undermines the ability for payers to receive high quality information” and that the “FDA has not addressed payers communications in a meaningful way.” The agency will now consider whether to issue new guidance. FDA spokesperson Sarah Peddicord said in an email that the FDA insteads “to provide new guidance as needed after the meeting.” Share this content: facebook twitter linkedin google Comments Print Similar Articles Will drugmakers get what they're looking for at this week's FDA off-label hearing?

Login Register Public Release: 13-Nov-2016 Study finds following a healthy lifestyle can greatly reduce genetic heart attack risk Even among those at highest genetic risk, lifestyle factors can reduce incidence by one half Massachusetts General Hospital Share  Print  E-Mail It is well known that following a healthy lifestyle -- not smoking, avoiding excess weight and getting regular exercise - can reduce the risk of heart disease. But what about people who have inherited gene variants known to increase risk? A study led by Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) investigators has found that, even among those at high genetic risk, following a healthy lifestyle can cut in half the probability of a heart attack or similar event. Their report is receiving early online publication in the New England Journal of Medicine to coincide with a presentation at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions. "The basic message of our study is that DNA is not destiny," says Sekar Kathiresan, MD, director of the Center for Human Genetic Research at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), senior author of the NEJM report. "Many individuals - both physicians and members of the general public -- have looked on genetic risk as unavoidable, but for heart attack that does not appear to be the case." In order to investigate whether a healthy lifestyle can mitigate genetic risk, the multi-institutional research team analyzed genetic and clinical data from more than 55,000 participants in four large-scale studies. Three of these -- the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, the Women's Genome Health Study, and the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study -- are prospective studies that have followed participants for up to 20 years. The fourth, the BioImage Study, assessed a variety of risk factors, including the presence of atherosclerotic plaques in the coronary arteries when participants joined the study. Each participant in the current analysis was assigned a genetic risk score, based on whether they carried any of 50 gene variants that previous studies associated with elevated heart attack risk. Based on data gathered when participants entered each study, the investigators used four AHA-defined lifestyle factors -- no current smoking; lack of obesity, defined as a body mass index less than 30; physical exercise at least once a week, and a healthy dietary pattern -- to determine a lifestyle score, whether participants had a favorable (three or four healthy factors), intermediate (two factors) or unfavorable (one or no healthy factors) lifestyle. For participants in the prospective studies, the research team investigated how each individual's genetic risk score and lifestyle factors related to the incidence of heart attack, the need for procedures designed to open blocked coronary arteries, or sudden cardiac death. Among participants in the BioImage study, genetic and lifestyle factors were compared to the extent of atherosclerotic disease in the coronary arteries at baseline. Across all three prospective studies, a higher genetic risk score significantly increased the incidence of coronary events -- as much as 90 percent in those at highest risk. While known risk factors such as a family history and elevated LDL cholesterol were also associated with an elevated genetic risk score, genetic risk was the most powerful contributor to cardiac risk. Similarly, each healthy lifestyle factor reduced risk, and the unfavorable lifestyle group also had higher levels of hypertension, diabetes and other known risk factors upon entering the studies. Within each genetic risk category, the presence of lifestyle factors significantly altered the risk of coronary events to such an extent that following a favorable lifestyle could reduce the incidence of coronary events by 50 percent in those with the highest genetic risk scores. Among participants in the BioImage study, both genetic and lifestyle factors were independently associated with levels of calcium-containing plaque in the coronary arteries, and healthy lifestyle factors were associated with less extensive plaque within each genetic risk group. "Some people may feel they cannot escape a genetically determined risk for heart attack, but our findings indicate that following a healthy lifestyle can powerfully reduce genetic risk," says Kathiresan, who is director of the Cardiovascular Disease Initiative at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and an associate professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. "Now we need to investigate whether specific lifestyle factors have stronger impacts and conduct studies in more diverse populations, since most of the participants in these studies are white." ### The lead authors of the NEJM paper are Amit Khera, MD, MGH Cardiology and Center for Human Genetic Research (CHGR), and Connor Emdin, DPhil, Broad Institute.

'Field of ankylosing spondylitis management has suddenly come alive' MedpageToday savesaved register today Earn Free CME Credits by reading the latest medical news in your specialty.sign up by Nancy Walsh Nancy Walsh Senior Staff Writer, MedPage Today November 13, 2016 Action Points Note that this study was published as an abstract and presented at a conference. These data and conclusions should be considered to be preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. Tofacitinib, an oral JAK inhibitor, demonstrated greater clinical and imaging efficacy than placebo in reducing the signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in adults with active AS. Note that tofacitinib inhibits signaling mechanisms in the cell that are relevant to inflammation, but we do not fully understand which signaling mechanisms may be particularly important in spondylitis. When the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors came on the scene in the late 1990s as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, the biologic revolution began, and a formerly crippling disease was transformed into one with a treatment goal of sustained remission. The TNF inhibitors were followed by multiple other biologics that target various inflammatory pathways, with modes of administration ranging from intravenous infusions and subcutaneous injections to oral tablets. The successes seen in rheumatoid arthritis were then followed by use of these medications in other conditions including inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and psoriatic arthritis. And more recently, "the field of ankylosing spondylitis [AS] management has suddenly come alive," Atul Deodhar, MD, of Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, told MedPage Today in an interview. For instance, earlier this year the interleukin 17A inhibitor secukinumab (Cosentyx) was approved for use in AS, while trials also are exploring the possibility of targeting the IL-12/23 pathways with ustekinumab (Stelara) and also the JAK-STAT pathway, with agents such as the JAK 1/3 inhibitor tofacitinib (Xeljanz). Tofacitinib in Phase II At this year's annual meeting of the European League Against Rheumatism, Desiree van der Heijde, MD, PhD, of the University of Leiden in the Netherlands, presented the results of a phase II dose-ranging study of tofacitinib in AS. The trial included 207 patients who were randomized to receive placebo or tofacitinib in dosages of 2, 5, or 10 mg twice daily for 12 weeks, with follow-up continuing to week 16. More than two-thirds of the patients were men, mean age was 42, and mean disease duration was 6.3 years. The mean Bath AS Disease Activity Index at baseline was 6.7. The primary endpoint of a 20% improvement in the Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society (ASAS20) response criteria at week 12 was met by 40.1% of the placebo group, 56% of the tofacitinib 2-mg group, 63% of the 5-mg group, and 67.4% of the 10-mg group. The increased rates compared with placebo were 15.8% (95% CI 11.1-19.9), 22.9% (95% CI 17.8-28), and 27.3% (95% CI 21.8-33). Benefits also were seen on secondary endpoints. For instance, the ASAS40 response rates were 19.6% in the placebo group, 42.3% in the 2-mg group (P<0.05), 46.2% in the 5-mg group (P<0.01), and 38.5% in the 10-mg group (P<0.01). The changes from baseline on the AS Disease Activity Score in the 2-, 5-, and 10-mg groups were -1.2 (P<0.01), -1.4 (P<0.001), and -1.4 (P<0.001), respectively, compared with -0.7 in the placebo group. On the Bath AS Functional Index (BASFI), the changes from baseline in the 2-, 5-, and 10-mg groups were -1.9, -2.4, and -2.2, respectively, which was a statistically significant difference from placebo in the two higher-dose groups (P<0.05). Imaging findings also showed benefits. On the Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada scores, significant changes were seen on MRI of the sacroiliac joints for the 5-mg and 10-mg groups (-3.2 and -3.6, P<0.05 for both) and also for MRI of the spine (-5.5 and -6.6, P<0.001 for both). "The changes on MRI were quite impressive and comparable to what we've seen with TNF inhibitors," said Walter Maksymowych, MD, of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, who participated in the study. "Our past experience has shown that a good MRI response usually indicates that there's going to be a good clinical response. They don't always correlate, but it's usually an indication that the therapeutic strategy is going to work," he said in an interview. No AS-specific safety concerns were noted in the study, although "in the 16-week time frame there really wasn't any opportunity to seriously explore adverse events," Maksymowych said. "It seems to be a well tolerated agent in both rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis," he said. The Outlook Tofacitinib inhibits signaling mechanisms in the cell that are relevant to inflammation, Maksymowych explained. "We do not fully understand which signaling mechanisms may be particularly important in spondylitis. That's still an area of investigation," he said. As to efficacy, "It's early days yet," he said. "When we look at some of the major clinical response measures, like ASAS40 and BASFI, it's actually fairly comparable to the TNF inhibitors. So I'd have to say it looks like a promising approach, because it's an oral drug, and we don't have a lot of options for the use of oral agents in this condition," he said. The JAK pathway should be explored further, he stated. "There's still very much an unmet need in spondylitis because only about 50% of patients have major clinical responses. It affects young people, and is a common disease, but we don't have disease-modifying therapies that can prevent the progression of the ankylosis," Maksymowych said. "So there are still a lot of major challenges in this condition that have been overcome in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and to some degree in psoriatic arthritis," he said. However, the unmet needs in AS may persist. "I believe Pfizer will not pursue the indication," predicted John J. Cush, MD, of Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas. "This is largely because of disappointing results and crowded competition. They also are having trouble getting approval for psoriasis. If they can't get psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis approval, then AS isn't worth it -- not in this era of IL-17 drugs, IL-12/23, and IL-23 looming," Cush told MedPage Today.

Skip to content Military Technologies Military Press Releases Xencor Presents Preliminary Data from an Ongoing, Open-label, Phase 2 Study of XmAb®5871 in IgG4-Related Disease (IgG4-RD) at the American College of Rheumatology 2016 Annual Meeting “I am impressed by the steady ‘dialing down’ of the inflammatory response that XmAb5871 seems to exert in IgG4-RD and believe it is a promising potential therapy,” said Dr. John H. Stone, the principal investigator of the study. “We are learning a lot about how to study this disease in the context of this small trial.” As of a data cutoff of October 31, 2016, 12 patients with active IgG4-RD have been enrolled and dosed with XmAb5871 (median number of infusions = 7, range 1-12). Patients had a median IgG4-RD RI of 10 (range 2-30) with a median of four organs involved (range 1-10) at the time of study entry. Organ site involvement occurring at a frequency of greater than or equal to 50% included lymph nodes, submandibular glands, parotid glands and lacrimal glands. Preliminary Safety Data: Every other week intravenous administration of XmAb5871 has been well tolerated. As of October 31, 2016, no serious adverse events (AEs) have been reported. Treatment related AEs have occurred in five patients (42%). Treatment-related AEs that occurred in more than one patient were abdominal pain/discomfort in three patients (25%), occurring as part of Grade 1 (mild) infusion-related gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea and/or vomiting and/or diarrhea) during the first infusion, and Grade 1 (mild) headache in two patients (16.7%). One patient discontinued the study as the result of an AE. The patient developed a Grade 2 (moderate) hypersensitivity reaction with rash and arthritis, commonly referred to as serum sickness, following the fifth infusion. The event resolved quickly without the need for medical management. This patient was subsequently found to have developed anti-drug antibodies. Preliminary Efficacy Data: Eleven of the 12 patients dosed with XmAb5871 have had at least one IgG4-RD RI performed following dosing as of the data cutoff date. Nine of 11 patients (82%) have had an initial response to XmAb5871 therapy of at least a three-point reduction in the IgG4-RD RI within two weeks of the first dose. Five patients attained disease remission (an IgG4-RD RI of 0) during the study. Two patients entering the study on corticosteroids have been able to taper and discontinue steroid use during the study. In addition to the patient with early study termination due to an AE, two other patients have discontinued treatment prior to receipt of all 12 planned infusions. One patient had a response to therapy (IgG4-RD RI reduction of six points), but lost response following the sixth infusion, at which point this patient discontinued treatment. One patient had no response to therapy as defined by a greater than or equal to two-point decrease in the IgG4-RD RI. This patient had an atypical presentation of larynx involvement as the only organ involved. The patient discontinued the study after six infusions. Neither of these two patients have responded to subsequent rituximab treatment. The slide presentation will be available at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time today on the ‘Investors’ page of Xencor’s website under ‘Events and Presentations’ at www.xencor.com. Conference Call Information Xencor management will host a conference call and webcast today at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss data presented today. The live call may be accessed by dialing (877) 359-9508 for domestic callers or (224) 357-2393 for international callers, and providing the conference ID number 16658995. A live webcast of the conference call will be available online from the investors section of the Xencor website at www.xencor.com. The webcast will be archived on the Company’s website for 30 days. About XmAb®5871-03   XmAb5871-03 is an open-label, single-arm study of up to 15 patients with histopathologically proven IgG4-RD with active disease as defined by disease activity in one or more organ systems and an IgG4-RD RI of greater than or equal to three. Participants will receive XmAb5871 by intravenous infusion every other week for up to a total of 12 infusions. Primary and secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of every other week intravenous administration of XmAb5871 on the IgG4-RD RI in patients with active IgG4-RD and to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of XmAb5871 in patients with active IgG4-RD over an up to six-month period. The primary endpoint of the completed study will be the proportion of patients on Day 169 with an improvement of disease activity score as defined by a decrease of IgG4-RD RI of greater than or equal to two points from the Day 1 pre-dose disease activity score. About XmAb®5871    XmAb®5871 is a first-in-class monoclonal antibody that targets CD19 with its variable domain and that uses Xencor’s XmAb immune inhibitor Fc domain to target FcγRIIb, a receptor that inhibits B-cell function. XmAb5871 is the first drug candidate that Xencor is aware of that targets FcγRIIb inhibition. Xencor has demonstrated in multiple animal models and in initial human clinical trials that XmAb5871 inhibits B-cell function without destroying these important immune cells, and demonstrated promising treatment effect in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, as well as ex vivo results showing inhibition of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patient B-cell activation and humoral immunity. Complete data results from a Phase 1b/2a study of XmAb5871 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis were presented at the American College of Rheumatology 2015 Annual Meeting as well as at the EULAR 2015 Annual Meeting. Ex vivo studies of SLE patient B cells were published in Journal of Immunology, 2011, 186(7):4223. About IgG4-Related Disease  IgG4-Related Disease (IgG4-RD) is a rare fibro-inflammatory autoimmune disorder that is estimated to impact up to 40,000 patients in the United States. IgG4-RD affects multiple organ systems and is characterized by a distinct microscopic appearance of diseased organs, including the presence of IgG4-positive plasmablast cells. This objective diagnostic criterion is atypical for autoimmune diseases and offers advantages for accurately identifying patients. There are currently no approved therapies for this newly recognized disorder and corticosteroids are the current standard of care. John H. Stone, M.D, MPH, director, clinical rheumatology at Massachusetts General Hospital has developed and is validating the IgG4-RD Responder Index (RI), a proposed instrument to assess disease activity. About Xencor’s XmAb® Immune Inhibitor Technology FcγRIIb (IIb), also called CD32b, is a receptor for Fc domains on B cells and other immune cells. When engaged, the IIb receptor blocks immune activation pathways and traffics bound soluble antigens out of circulation. Xencor has discovered a series of Fc domain variants with up to a 400-fold increase in binding affinity to FcγRIIb derived from just two amino acid changes. These XmAb® Immune Inhibitor Fc domains greatly heighten the properties of IIb receptor engagement and have potential as building blocks for drug candidates in autoimmune, allergic and inflammatory diseases. About Xencor, Inc. Xencor is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing engineered monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, asthma and allergic diseases and cancer. Currently, 10 candidates engineered with Xencor’s XmAb® technology are in clinical development internally and with partners.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Xencor Presents Preliminary Data from an Ongoing, Open-label, Phase 2 Study of XmAb®5871 in IgG4-Related Disease (IgG4-RD) at the American College of Rheumatology 2016 Annual Meeting MONROVIA, Calif., Nov. 13, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — Xencor, Inc. (NASDAQ: XNCR), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing engineered monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, asthma and allergic diseases and cancer, today announced preliminary data from XmAb5871-03, an ongoing, open-label, pilot Phase 2 study of XmAb5871 in patients with active IgG4- RD. Data show that 82% of patients achieved an initial response to therapy within two weeks of their first dose. The data are being presented by John H. Stone, M.D., MPH, director of rheumatology at Massachusetts General Hospital, at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 2016 Annual Meeting in the Miscellaneous Rheumatic and Inflammatory Disease session on Sunday, November 13, 2016 (today) at 2:45 p.m. EST. “We are very encouraged by the rapid initial response in IgG4-RD disease activity observed in this preliminary data set, in which nine of the 11 patients evaluated for IgG4-RD Responder Index (RI) post-treatment achieved a response within two weeks of their first dose, with responses typically deepening over time,” said Paul Foster, M.D., chief medical officer of Xencor. “We expect to report complete study results in 2017.” “I am impressed by the steady ‘dialing down’ of the inflammatory response that XmAb5871 seems to exert in IgG4-RD and believe it is a promising potential therapy,” said Dr. John H.

The event resolved quickly without the need for medical management. This patient was subsequently found to have developed anti-drug antibodies. Preliminary Efficacy Data: Eleven of the 12 patients dosed with XmAb5871 have had at least one IgG4-RD RI performed following dosing as of the data cutoff date. Nine of 11 patients (82%) have had an initial response to XmAb5871 therapy of at least a three-point reduction in the IgG4-RD RI within two weeks of the first dose. Five patients attained disease remission (an IgG4-RD RI of 0) during the study. Two patients entering the study on corticosteroids have been able to taper and discontinue steroid use during the study. In addition to the patient with early study termination due to an AE, two other patients have discontinued treatment prior to receipt of all 12 planned infusions. One patient had a response to therapy (IgG4-RD RI reduction of six points), but lost response following the sixth infusion, at which point this patient discontinued treatment. One patient had no response to therapy as defined by a greater than or equal to two-point decrease in the IgG4-RD RI. This patient had an atypical presentation of larynx involvement as the only organ involved. The patient discontinued the study after six infusions. Neither of these two patients have responded to subsequent rituximab treatment.

About XmAb®5871-03   XmAb5871-03 is an open-label, single-arm study of up to 15 patients with histopathologically proven IgG4-RD with active disease as defined by disease activity in one or more organ systems and an IgG4-RD RI of greater than or equal to three. Participants will receive XmAb5871 by intravenous infusion every other week for up to a total of 12 infusions. Primary and secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of every other week intravenous administration of XmAb5871 on the IgG4-RD RI in patients with active IgG4-RD and to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of XmAb5871 in patients with active IgG4-RD over an up to six-month period. The primary endpoint of the completed study will be the proportion of patients on Day 169 with an improvement of disease activity score as defined by a decrease of IgG4-RD RI of greater than or equal to two points from the Day 1 pre-dose disease activity score. About XmAb®5871    XmAb®5871 is a first-in-class monoclonal antibody that targets CD19 with its variable domain and that uses Xencor’s XmAb immune inhibitor Fc domain to target FcγRIIb, a receptor that inhibits B-cell function. XmAb5871 is the first drug candidate that Xencor is aware of that targets FcγRIIb inhibition. Xencor has demonstrated in multiple animal models and in initial human clinical trials that XmAb5871 inhibits B-cell function without destroying these important immune cells, and demonstrated promising treatment effect in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, as well as ex vivo results showing inhibition of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patient B-cell activation and humoral immunity. Complete data results from a Phase 1b/2a study of XmAb5871 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis were presented at the American College of Rheumatology 2015 Annual Meeting as well as at the EULAR 2015 Annual Meeting. Ex vivo studies of SLE patient B cells were published in Journal of Immunology, 2011, 186(7):4223. About IgG4-Related Disease  IgG4-Related Disease (IgG4-RD) is a rare fibro-inflammatory autoimmune disorder that is estimated to impact up to 40,000 patients in the United States. IgG4-RD affects multiple organ systems and is characterized by a distinct microscopic appearance of diseased organs, including the presence of IgG4-positive plasmablast cells. This objective diagnostic criterion is atypical for autoimmune diseases and offers advantages for accurately identifying patients. There are currently no approved therapies for this newly recognized disorder and corticosteroids are the current standard of care. John H. Stone, M.D, MPH, director, clinical rheumatology at Massachusetts General Hospital has developed and is validating the IgG4-RD Responder Index (RI), a proposed instrument to assess disease activity. About Xencor’s XmAb® Immune Inhibitor Technology FcγRIIb (IIb), also called CD32b, is a receptor for Fc domains on B cells and other immune cells. When engaged, the IIb receptor blocks immune activation pathways and traffics bound soluble antigens out of circulation. Xencor has discovered a series of Fc domain variants with up to a 400-fold increase in binding affinity to FcγRIIb derived from just two amino acid changes. These XmAb® Immune Inhibitor Fc domains greatly heighten the properties of IIb receptor engagement and have potential as building blocks for drug candidates in autoimmune, allergic and inflammatory diseases. About Xencor, Inc. Xencor is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing engineered monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, asthma and allergic diseases and cancer. Currently, 10 candidates engineered with Xencor’s XmAb® technology are in clinical development internally and with partners.

This is the fifth installment. -- Ed. Faced with the continued slowdown of its manufacturing sector, South Korea is eyeing new growth in the field of biotechnology, a promising industry expected for a sharp growth in the years ahead. Biotechnology broadly refers to the use of genetic engineering and molecular biology to modify living cells to produce novel substances that perform new functions. Its biggest applications are in “red biotechnology” -- the development of complex drugs based on living cells, proteins, blood components and other biochemicals. The Korean government has set medical biotechnology, particularly new drug development, as a key priority, investing 2.38 trillion won in the local biotech sector in 2015, according to the Korea Biotechnology Industry Organization. (123RF) Despite its potential, experts say Korea’s biotech sector faces many hurdles to growth, including risks and failures associated with new drug development, immense costs of research and development as well as insufficient workforce trained in the life sciences. Korea was recently reminded of the difficulties of new drug development through a case involving Hanmi Pharmaceutical, a pioneering local drugmaker that has successfully developed multiple new drugs and licensed them out to global pharmaceutical firms. In September, Hanmi announced that its partner Boehringer Ingelheim terminated a $730 million licensing deal it had entered with Hanmi over a new lung cancer therapy back in July 2015, after a patient died of the drug’s side effects during the drug’s phase 2 clinical trials overseas. Hanmi’s shares plunged by more than 18 percent on the day of the announcement. In addition to the apparent financial losses, the incident served as a humble reminder to Korean investors and the public of just how difficult it is to develop a new, safe and effective drug that can be approved and brought to the market. “Hanmi’s case sheds light on the immense difficulties of new drug development,” Shinhan Investment & Securities analyst Bae Ki-dal said in a research note on Hanmi’s setback. According to a June 2016 report by the US Food & Drug Administration on clinical success rates, there is only a 9.6 percent likelihood that a new drug in phase 1 clinical trials will be approved for sale. The figure is just slightly higher, 15.3 percent, for drugs in phase 2 trials. Moreover, a majority of developing drugs do not advance to the final clinical trial stage. Only 30.7 percent of developmental drug candidates in phase 2 trials advance to phase 3, according to the FDA’s report. In other words, new drug development demands immense time, R&D, money and patience. It is “a game of probability with low chances of clinical development success,” as described by Eugene Investment & Securities analyst Kwak Jin-hee. Given the high costs and difficulties of new drug development, some Korean firms have chosen to embark on the medical biotech business from a different entry point. For instance, Samsung BioLogics is pursuing the contract drug manufacturing business -- making drugs on behalf of other biopharma firms -- while Celltrion and Samsung Bioepis are developing biosimilars -- cheaper, near-replicas of expensive biologic drugs that have lost patent protection. However, whether it is new drug development or the production of existing biologic drugs and biosimilars, industry insiders agree on a key problem -- the lack of skilled employees specialized in the life sciences and biopharma production. A 2015 KBIO survey of biotech companies on the current state of the biotech workforce showed that 37.6 percent of companies feel that there is a shortage of applicants with the right, needed skills and 33.9 percent said that applicants lack the right level of experience needed for a given position. Eyeing this need, local universities and multinational companies have recently begun to take action, albeit on a small scale. It remains to be seen whether these efforts will help nurture Korea’s biotech workforce. Last month, GE Healthcare and German life sciences firm Merck opened a new training center in Incheon’s Songdo district to provide technical assistance to companies looking to develop and produce new biologic drugs and technologies. Throughout this year, Korean universities such as Incheon National University, Hanyang University, Dongguk University and Konkuk University have launched new academic programs focusing on field-based medical biotechnology such as biopharma production, product quality management, clinical trials as well as marketing and sales.
