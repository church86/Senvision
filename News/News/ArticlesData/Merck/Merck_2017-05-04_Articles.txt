Signs Clinical Supply Agreement with Merck for Investigational Tau Imaging Agent TORONTO–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Cerveau Technologies, Inc. today announced finalization of a clinical supply agreement with Merck, known as MSD outside the US and Canada, providing access to an investigational imaging agent being evaluated in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans for assessing the status and progression of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain. NFTs made up of aggregated tau protein are believed to provide a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease. As part of the agreement Cerveau will be responsible for providing access to MK-6240 at multiple sites globally to be used in Merck-specific research initiatives. Cerveau will be accelerating technology transfer and site qualification in over fifteen sites to provide access to support broad availability. “At Cerveau, we are focused on providing information and technologies to researchers and clinicians in order to improve brain health,” said Rick Hiatt, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cerveau Technologies, Inc. “We are excited by the opportunity to work with Merck and the pharmaceutical industry in providing access to this investigational imaging agent to the broader scientific community. We are rapidly establishing collaborations and agreements to improve processes in order to support multiple initiatives around the world.” “There is a critical need for new imaging agents that provide sensitive biomarkers to enable early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases and allow for more appropriate staging of disease states, and measuring the effect of disease-modifying therapeutics,” said Cyrille Sur, Executive Director, Translational Imaging Biomarkers, Merck Research Laboratories. “Agreements such as this provide a platform to evaluate the potential of our novel Tau imaging agent.” In early studies published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, Merck scientists reported that [18F]MK-6240 has a high specificity and selectivity for neurofibrillary tangles with favorable physicochemical properties and in vivo pharmacokinetics that warranted clinical investigation as a potential PET neuroimaging agent. Merck and Cerveau are currently conducting an open-label Phase 1 study to investigate the safety and efficacy of [18F]MK-6240 as a PET imaging agent for quantifying brain burden of neurofibrillary tangle pathology. For further information about the trial please go to clinical trials.gov (NCT02562989). About Cerveau Technologies, Inc. Cerveau Technologies, Inc. is a partnership between Enigma Biomedical Group, Inc. and Sinotau Pharmaceutical Group. Cerveau’s vision is to globally develop diagnostics and technology that will impact patients with neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s disease.

Inc. rallied 2% in premarket trade Tuesday, after the drug giant reported first-quarter profit and sales that rose above expectations, and lifted its full-year outlook. Net income increased to $1.55 billion, or 56 cents a share, from $1.13 billion, or 40 cents a share in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share came to 88 cents, beating the FactSet consensus of 83 cents. Revenue rose 1% to $9.43 billion from $9.31 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $9.25 billion, as better-than-expected Januvia/Janumet and animal health sales helped offset a miss for Keytruda. For 2017, Merck raised its adjusted EPS outlook to $3.76 to $3.88 from $3.72 to $3.87 and its revenue outlook to $39.1 billion to $40.3 billion from $38.6 billion to $40.1 billion. The stock has rallied 6% year to date through Monday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained 5.8%.

Inc. to settle a patent infringement suit related to Merck's Keytruda skin-cancer treatment. Under terms of the settlement, PDL will grant Merck a fully paid-up, royalty free, non-exclusive license to certain of the patent rights related to Keytruda, as well as an agreement not to sue Merck for royalties regarding Keytruda. "We are pleased to resolve this patent infringement lawsuit with Merck with a favorable monetary settlement to PDL as well as eliminating potential future litigation costs related to this matter for both parties," said PDL Chief Executive John McLaughlin. The stock has shed 4.7% year to date through Friday, while Merck shares have advanced 5.1% and the S&P 500 has gained 4.9%.

Apr. 10, 2017 at 4:06 p.m. ET by Wallace Witkowski Merck receives FDA Complete Response Letter for medicines using sitagliptin Merck & Co. Inc. shares fell 1.5% in premarket trade Friday, after the company said it received a Complete Response Letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regarding its application to include data on cardiovascular effects in the prescribing information of medicines using Sitagliptin, a treatment for type 2 diabetes. A CRL is a communication from the FDA that a drug application will not be approved in its current form. Merck said it is reviewing the letter and will discuss its next steps with the FDA. Merck shares have gained 7% in 2017, while the S&P 500 has gained 5%.

The company's indoximod was being tested in combination with Merck's Keytruda. NewLink Genetics said that data on 60 patients found an objective response rate of 52% and a disease control rate of 73%, with rates slightly higher among patients with non-ocular melanoma, at a 59% objective response rate and an 80% disease control rate. Though the company described the results -- which it is presenting at the American Association for Cancer Research's annual meeting on Tuesday -- as impressive and emphasized that the cancer drug combination was well tolerated overall, investors questioned how much of an effect the company's drug had relative to Merck's Keytruda alone and compared NewLink Genetics negatively to Incyte Corp. , which is also developing an IDO inhibitor and is working with Merck. NewLink Genetics shares were valued at $18.40 as of Tuesday morning. The company's shares have surged 63.8% over the last three months, compared with a 3.8% rise in the S&P 500 .

Pfizer, which markets and sells Celltrion’s Remicade biosimilar in the US and other global markets, said in its earnings report for the January-March period Wednesday that worldwide sales of its biosimilars in the quarter came to $105 million. Of this amount, global sales of Remsima reached $78 million. Remsima is Celltrion’s biosimilar referencing J&J’s blockbuster autoimmune disease treatment Remicade (infliximab). Pfizer began selling Remsima under the name Inflectra in the US, the world’s biggest market for biologic drugs, from November 2016. In the US, Pfizer’s sales of Inflectra reached 17 million in the first quarter, jumping by more than 300 percent from just $4 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Celltrion's headquarters in Songdo, Incheon (Park Hyun-koo/The Korea Herald) Biosimilars refer to cheaper, near-replicas of live cell biologic drugs that have lost patent protection. Many drugmakers have taken to developing these lower-cost alternative drugs in time for the patent expiry of some of the world’s top-selling medications. Pfizer said its biosimilars business led by Inflectra recorded a robust 62 percent operational growth in the first quarter to offset the falling revenues of its flagship “essential health” division products, such as antidepressant Pristiq and anti-epileptic drug Lyrica. On the other hand, sales of Remicade in the US appear to have fallen, though by a small margin for now, presumably due to the introduction of the biosimilar. J&J’s Remicade sales in the US fell 2.4 percent to $1.18 billion in the first quarter, according to the firm’s quarterly earnings announced last month. Meanwhile, Remsima appears to be expanding its market share in Europe, a region where biosimilars were long approved and are therefore prescribed more readily in comparison to the US. Celltrion said that Remsima, introduced to the region in 2014, has taken away more than 40 percent of the original drug’s market in Europe as of now, quoting the latest data compiled by IMS Health. Merck & Co., also known as MSD internationally, which handles the sales of Remicade on behalf of J&J in Europe, reported that the blockbuster drug’s sales fell 34 percent on-year to $229 million in the first quarter. MSD cited the drop in Remicade’s sales in the region to continued competition with biosimilars. Celltrion said it expects Remsima’s sales to continually expand in the coming months as it continues to eat into a bigger portion of the original drug’s sales in the US and Europe. Remsima, currently the only Remicade-referencing biosimilar available in the US, is expected to retain its exclusive status in the country for a year or so, the Korean drugmaker said. Last month, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the second Remicade-referencing biosimilar, developed by Korea’s Samsung Bioepis. However, sales of Samsung’s Remicade biosimilar will not begin until late this year, as companies are required to wait 180 days after approval to begin selling a biosimilar, according to US regulations governing the new biologic drug category. Moreover, Celltrion said it will take additional time for the competing Remicade biosimilar to formally arrive at hospitals in the US, as it will have to clear pricing negotiations and get through the procedures to be listed on the country’s health insurance system. “Given this, Remsima is forecast to retain its exclusivity in the US market for around one year or so,” Celltrion said in a statement. “We expect Remsima to quickly drive up its market share in the US quarter by quarter, as it did in Europe,” the company said, noting that it is currently wrapping up procedures to register its cheaper infliximab drug into the national and private health insurance system in the US.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Atara Biotherapeutics Announces First Quarter 2017 Financial Results and Recent Highlights SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., May 04, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:ATRA) today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2017 and recent operational highlights. /EIN News/ — „We continued to make important progress advancing our robust pipeline of T-cell therapies in the first quarter,” said Isaac Ciechanover, Chief Executive Officer and President of Atara Biotherapeutics. “With the expected initiation of two Phase 3 trials this year and a conditional marketing authorization submission in the EU next year for our lead oncology product candidate, ATA129, we are on our way to becoming a commercial immunotherapy company.  The recent data reported at AAN with autologous ATA188 in progressive multiple sclerosis also highlights the potential to expand our platform beyond oncology to include autoimmune disease.” Recent Highlights and Anticipated Upcoming Milestones • Manufacture and testing of allogeneic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-Specific Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL), or ATA129, including assay refinement and discussions with FDA, are ongoing and continuing as planned. Manufacturing lots to further support comparability evaluations and the Phase 3 trials. • Plan to initiate two Phase 3 pivotal trials with ATA129 in EBV-Associated Post Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder (EBV-PTLD) in the second half of 2017. Phase 3 trials intended to support approval in two indications: rituximab-refractory EBV-PTLD after hematopoietic cell transplant or solid organ transplant. Planned Phase 3 sites include leading bone marrow and solid organ transplant centers in the US and Europe. • Announced collaboration with Merck to evaluate KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in combination with ATA129 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Phase 1/2 trial sponsored and conducted by Atara in patients with platinum resistant or recurrent NPC with pembrolizumab provided by Merck is planned to start in 2018. • Obtained European Medicines Agency Scientific Advice for ATA129 under PRIME designation and plan to submit in 2018 a conditional marketing authorization (CMA) in Europe for the treatment of EBV-PTLD after hematopoietic cell transplant. Plan to develop EU infrastructure to support CMA submission and potential commercialization in Europe. • Announced key management appointments as the Company expands operations and core capabilities, advances its pipeline and moves towards the potential commercialization of ATA129, including: Joe Newell, Executive Vice President and Chief Technical Operations Officer, and John Craighead, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. • Atara’s collaborating investigators announced positive interim results from an ongoing Phase 1 trial of autologous ATA188 in patients with progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) at the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting 2017. Encouraging clinical improvements were observed in three of six progressive MS patients with advanced disease, which were correlated with CTL reactivity against target EBV antigens (EBV reactivity). Ongoing autologous ATA188 Phase 1 trial estimated to complete enrollment in the third quarter of 2017. • Expect to pursue clinical development of both autologous and allogeneic ATA188 to further inform and potentially accelerate the Company’s development program in MS. Based on FDA discussions, a planned Phase 1 allogeneic ATA188 trial in MS is on track to initiate in the second half of 2017. First Quarter 2017 Financial Results • Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of March 31, 2017 totaled $230.6 million, which the Company believes will be sufficient to fund planned operations into the first quarter of 2019. • The Company reported net losses of $25.7 million, or $0.88 per share, for the first quarter of 2017, as compared to $16.6 million, or $0.58 per share, for the same period in 2016. Substantially all of the Company’s net losses resulted from research and development expenses related to clinical and preclinical programs and from general and administrative expenses associated with operations. • Research and development expenses were $17.5 million for the first quarter of 2017, as compared to $11.2 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in the first quarter of 2017 was due to costs associated with the Company’s continuing expansion of research and development activities, including the following: manufacturing and outside service costs related to the preparation for the two Phase 3 clinical trials of ATA129 in EBV-PTLD, ongoing costs for the Company’s expanded access protocol clinical trial for ATA129, which was initiated in mid-2016, higher payroll and related costs from increased headcount, and an increase in allocated facilities and information technology expenses.    Research and development expenses include $2.1 million and $2.2 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses in the first quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively. • General and administrative expenses were $8.6 million for first quarter of 2017, as compared to $5.8 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs driven by increased headcount to support the Company’s expanding operations and higher consulting, outside services and legal costs. General and administrative expenses include $3.2 million and $2.5 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses in the first quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively. About Atara’s “Off-the-Shelf” Allogeneic Immunotherapy Platform Atara’s immunotherapy platform provides healthy immune capability to a patient and arms the immune system to precisely target and combat disease. T-cells derived from healthy donors are manufactured in advance and stored as inventory so that a customized unit of T-cells can be chosen for each patient. The T-cells are ready to infuse in approximately 3 to 5 days. Once administered, the T-cells home to their target, expand in-vivo to eliminate diseased cells, and eventually recede. This versatile platform can be directed towards a broad array of disease causing targets and has demonstrated clinical proof of concept across both viral and non-viral targets in conditions ranging from liquid and solid tumors to autoimmune and infectious diseases. The Company has pursued prospective feedback from health authorities on both manufacturing and clinical trial design. Atara’s lead product candidate, ATA129, has the potential to be the first commercial allogeneic T-cell therapy for a viral target implicated in cancer. About Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc. Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company developing meaningful therapies for patients with severe and life-threatening diseases who have been underserved by scientific innovation, with an initial focus on allogeneic T-cell therapies for cancer, autoimmune, and infectious disease. Atara’s T-cell product candidates harness the power of the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells and cells infected with certain viruses. The Company’s initial clinical stage T-cell product candidates include Epstein-Barr virus targeted Cytotoxic T-cells (EBV-CTL), or ATA129, Cytomegalovirus targeted Cytotoxic T-cells (CMV-CTL), or ATA230, and Wilms Tumor 1 targeted Cytotoxic T-cells (WT1-CTL), or ATA520. These product candidates have demonstrated the potential to have therapeutic benefit in a number of clinical indications including hematologic malignancies, solid tumors, and refractory viral infections. The Company is also developing a next generation of T-cell product candidates utilizing a technology to selectively enhance a T-cell’s ability to target specific viral proteins implicated in a disease. The Company’s ATA188 product candidate leverages this technology. Initial clinical investigations employing this approach will focus on multiple sclerosis and other virally mediated cancers.

The controversy is already having an impact on spending on drugs, suggest new figures from the QuintilesIMS Institute, a research firm. The rate of growth in spending on prescription medicines in America fell to 4.8% in 2016, less than half the average rate of the previous two years (after adjusting for discounts and rebates). Michael Levesque of Moody’s, a rating agency, reckons that pressure over pricing is contributing to a deceleration in earnings growth at pharma firms. Public scrutiny constrains their flexibility over what they can charge and allows payers to get tougher. In one area, however, earnings are expected to keep rising: cancer. Oncology is the industry’s bright spot, says Mr Levesque. The grim fact is that two-fifths of people can now expect to get cancer in their lifetime because of rising longevity. This is one of the reasons why the number of new cancer drugs has expanded by more than 60% over the past decade. The late-phase pipeline of new medicines contains more than 600 cancer treatments. New cancer drugs are being approved more quickly. Latest updates Striking out on the American dream Prospero14 hours ago Did a selfie accidentally reveal the administration’s plan to halt all visas?

On May 1st, America’s Food and Drug Administration approved durvalumab (trademarked Imfinzi), a drug from AstraZeneca, a British firm, which treats cancer of the bladder. Imfinzi, which has a wholesale price of $180,000 for treatment lasting a year, joins a growing crowd of medicines known as “checkpoint inhibitors”, designed to work on a key molecular target that helps the body’s own immune system to fight cancer. Merck of America has pembrolizumab (Keytruda); Bristol-Myers Squibb has nivolumab (Opdivo); and Switzerland’s Roche has atezolizumab (Tecentriq). These checkpoint inhibitors are expected to account for much of the growth in spending on cancer medicines. Merck, in particular, has done well with Keytruda. A sense of the value of the new drugs came when Opdivo failed a key clinical trial in August last year. The market value of Bristol-Myers Squibb fell by 16%, and its shares have been in the doldrums since. Handsome prices for cancer drugs are far less pleasing for governments, insurers and patients. Even five years ago, most newly-approved treatments had gross annual prices of more than $100,000. But the pressure on budgets has worsened with the new generation of more expensive immuno-oncology drugs, and could become more severe still if they are found to work best in combination with each other. Making a mistake over which cancer drugs to use can be extremely costly for a payer, as illustrated by a disastrous recent attempt by Britain’s government to increase access to new cancer drugs by creating a special fund in 2010. By the time it closed in 2016, £1.27bn ($1.83bn) had been spent, mostly on drugs that were later shown to be ineffective for the conditions they were tried on. Some think a better approach would be to try drugs out on patients and for payers to pay a price based on how well they work, an approach known as “value-based pricing”. That would mean collecting a great deal of data from patients, which would be far from straightforward. Some companies, such as Genentech, a biotech company owned by Roche, are trying to do just this, as are some payers including American health insurers. But however reassuring it is to know that money is going on drugs that are proven to work, it does not solve the broader problem of affordability.

Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Narendra Modi Donald Trump Bahubali 2 Exam results 2017 IPL 2017 News Health News With vaccines and vigilance, world better set for future Ebola outbreaks Shares1 Thu, 4 May 2017-09:31pm , Reuters By Kieran Guilbert DAKAR, May 4 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The lessons learned from the world's worst Ebola epidemic and progress made in developing vaccines mean future outbreaks should be far less damaging, health experts said on Thursday. Presidents and ministers from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone gathered in Conakry to celebrate those who had helped to contain West Africa's 2013-2016 epidemic, as well as the scientists who worked on vaccines against the deadly virus. The outbreak, which was declared over last year by the World Health Organization (WHO), killed more than 11,300 people and infected some 28,600 as it swept through the three countries. Overhauled and improved health protocols and facilities in the Ebola-hit nations, greater vigilance, and promising trials for two vaccines mean the world should be much better prepared for any future outbreaks, said Marie-Paule Kieny of the WHO. "It is important to take stock of the successes and also failures of the Ebola response to avoid complacency," the WHO assistant director-general told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from the event in Guinea's capital. "One of the most impressive aspects was the fact that quality research was conducted during the epidemic in Guinea, with the vaccine trial (for Merck's rVSV-EBOV shot)," she added. The Merck vaccine was the first to prove effective in preventing human infection, in a large trial in Guinea in 2015. Among 5,837 people, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination, showing 100 percent protection. Another vaccine, a two-part shot from Johnson & Johnson and Danish partner Bavarian Nordic, induced a durable immune response lasting a year in 100 percent of healthy volunteers vaccinated, researchers reported in March. While debate rages over the best vaccination strategy for different groups at risk of Ebola, health experts have hailed the importance of having more than one type of vaccine. "That we now have one vaccine candidate which has been demonstrated to be safe and highly effective and the possibility of other Ebola vaccines is an enormous achievement," said John Edmunds of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. "It will not only change the way that we control future Ebola outbreaks, but has shown how we might go about developing vaccines for similar epidemic-prone diseases," added Edmunds, a professor of infectious disease modelling at the school.

Menendez Says No to Wall Street First Policy Print Email Jonathan D. Salant | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com By Jonathan D. Salant | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on May 04, 2017 at 10:30 AM, updated May 04, 2017 at 11:46 AM comments WASHINGTON -- When the Senate confirmed Wall Street lawyer Jay Clayton to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission, U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez voted no. Among his concerns: Clayton wouldn't support efforts to require publicly traded corporations to disclose how much of their shareholders' money they spent on politics. While corporate political action committee contributions are disclosed, companies are free to secretly donate to trade associations and other nonprofit groups that can spend millions of dollars on politics. Though the SEC has received more than one million requests asking it to require corporate disclosure, it has yet to act. "Corporate insiders shouldn't be able to use investor money as a piggy bank to advance their personal political agendas without any oversight from shareholders," said Menendez (D-N.J.). Should companies disclose spending? Two New Jersey companies, Johnson & Johnson and Merck & Co., and their trade association spent more than $4 million from 2011 to 2016 to help elect Republican governors and legislatures trying to restrict funding for birth control. Menendez on Wednesday joined an effort to urge large mutual funds such as Vanguard to vote in favor of shareholder resolutions requiring companies to disclose all political spending. "We need mutual fund companies to step up and vote in the interest of their investors when disclosure of political spending is up for consideration, and we need an SEC that will truly stand up for investors and corporate governance principles and finally require this disclosure," Menendez said. Some companies already voluntarily disclose their spending.  Of 493 companies listed in the Standard & Poor's index, 224 reported their donations to trade groups or prohibit such contributions in 2016, up from 204 a year ago; and 153 disclosed donations to nonprofits or banned those, an increase from 125 in 2015, according to the Center for Public Accountability, a Washington-based advocacy group that supports disclosure.  This year, investors in 29 companies will vote on shareholder resolutions asking that political spending be revealed, up from 25 in 2016, according to the Center for Political Accountability. Lisa Gilbert, a Glen Rock native who is vice president for legislative affairs for Public Citizen, a Washington advocacy group, said mutual funds own enough shares in companies that they would ensure approval of such resolutions. A report issued Wednesday by the group said mutual funds would have made the difference in at least 16 companies where disclosure was defeated last year. Vanguard spokeswoman Arianna Stefanoni Sherlock declined comment. With Republicans in Congress unwilling to require companies to disclose their political spending, shareholders can take the lead, said Patrick Doherty, director of corporate governance for New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. "Bit by bit, we can end up getting large numbers of corporations to make these political disclosures," Doherty said. Clayton's law firm lobbied for Goldman Sachs,  the investment bank Trump president-elect blasted on the campaign trail. He was confirmed Tuesday, 61-37, with U.S. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) joining Menendez in voting no.  Jonathan D. Salant may be reached at jsalant@njadvancemedia.com. Follow him on Twitter @JDSalant or on Facebook.

The world’s biggest drugmakers don’t have the muscle they used to have. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology giants are finding it more difficult to charge high prices for a range of medications, their latest quarterly results show. That’s raising the pressure to pump up sales volumes and find lucrative new treatments for niche markets. QuickTake Drug Prices “You had an environment in which you could just price your drug anywhere you wanted, and generally people were paying for it -- that’s great,” Sean Harper, Amgen Inc.’s head of research and development, said in an interview in Boston. “But to my view, those days are coming to an end.” The reason: The big companies that pay for drugs are getting bigger. A series of tie-ups among insurers and pharmacy benefit managers has left drugmakers negotiating with a handful of powerful players. List prices for medications are still rising, but drugmakers are forced to give large rebates to insurers and pharmacy benefit companies that bestow spots on their coveted formularies -- the rosters of drugs covered by payers. “We do have a payer environment that’s been consolidating, and with that consolidation, there’s better negotiating power against pharmaceutical firms on price,” said Damien Conover, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. Flexing Muscle The shift comes after years of outcry over rising drug prices. Executives from Mylan NV, the maker of allergy shot EpiPen, and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. were brought before Congress to explain what they charge. The drugmakers’ trade group launched an ad campaign to highlight its scientific contributions and is reviewing its membership rules to force out gougers. Payers are flexing their muscles against drugmakers, particularly when a cheaper drug, such as a generic, can easily be swapped for a branded version that sells for more. The result is more pricing pressure in crowded disease areas like diabetes.  On Tuesday, Merck & Co. became the latest drugmaker to report a slowdown for diabetes drugs, after Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca Plc both blamed price pressures for hurting sales in the first quarter. Eli Lilly & Co. also posted sales for a diabetes drug that were lower than expected. “We’ve seen the pricing pressure and the pushback from the payers is even greater than what was initially expected,” said Ashtyn Evans, an analyst at Edward Jones & Co. Spreading the Blame With the added pressure, less-competitive disease areas could become more attractive for drugmakers hoping to maintain leverage, according to analysts and investors. Those could include cancer or rare diseases.  “There’s less that the payers are able to do,” Vamil Divan, a Credit Suisse analyst, said in a telephone interview. Some of Amgen’s investors have been pushing the company to double down on cancer and rare diseases, Harper said. To be sure, drugmakers also say they aren’t the only ones to blame for the high prices that have upset consumers and politicians. In March, Jim Meyers, executive vice president of worldwide commercial operations at Gilead Sciences Inc., said that PBMs encouraged high prices on its hepatitis C drug in order to receive bigger rebates. For its part, PBM Express Scripts Holding Co. responded that if the drug is worth less than Gilead’s price, payers should be made whole. Volume Emphasis Amgen Inc. has been struck coming and going by the growing power of the PBMs. Payer pushback has limited its ability to raise the price of its biggest drug, the arthritis treatment Enbrel. At the same time, PBMs have restricted access to Amgen’s new potential blockbuster, the heart drug Repatha, to only the sickest patients. Even after the company showed that the therapy helped reduce heart and stroke risks-- albeit less than investors hoped -- sales have been slow. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up While payers drive harder bargains, drugmakers are emphasizing sales volume as a way to draw attention from pricing, analysts said. On Lilly’s recent earnings call, the company said its U.S. pharma revenue increased 16 percent, primarily because of higher volume. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. said blood thinner Eliquis is leading its class in total prescriptions. AbbVie Inc. said its Humira sales volumes are rising. “If they have a new drug they’re very focused on saying, ‘this growth is due to volume and not a price increase we took,’” Edward Jones & Co.’s Evans said. But it’s unclear whether relying on volume growth is sustainable, according to Credit Suisse’s Divan. Price increases accounted for all of the industry’s earnings growth last year, he wrote in a recent note to clients. Amgen’s Harper said the solution is value-based pricing, in which some money may be refunded to insurers if a drug doesn’t work as expected. The concept is hard to execute, as conditions like diabetes can be tracked easily but other areas are murkier. There’s also little evidence that pay-for-performance will significantly lower drug prices overall. While Amgen has gotten at least one insurer to consent to a performance-based agreement, PBMs are still more interested in maximizing their rebates, Harper said. “They say, ‘great data guys, we get it,’” he said. “’But you know, if your list price was higher and your rebate was bigger, it would be an incentive for us.’” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

(Bloomberg/Brent Lewin) Topics China tourism Hainan medical-tourism Share this article  share on facebook  share on twitter  share on google plus  share on Linkedin  share on whatsapp  comment  share on email share this article follow Us    On the hilly and tropical island of Hainan, local officials and companies are investing billions of dollars to transform a string of riverside villages into a medical tourism destination. Their aim? To lure wealthy Chinese patients, who might otherwise venture overseas, to this province in the South China Sea known for its beach-front resorts. To do so they are making an unusual promise: The hub will bring in cutting-edge treatments for diseases like cancer that are available abroad, but don’t yet have regulatory approval in China. There’s plenty of demand. The travel site Ctrip.com estimates about half a million Chinese traveled abroad for medical services last year. Millions are dying from cancer and heart disease, but regulatory bottlenecks have slowed approvals for the newest international therapies. Chinese hospitals are overflowing, and affluent jet-setters prefer Japan for physical check-ups or the U.S. for genetic screenings. In 2013, the provincial government of Hainan, often known as China’s Hawaii, earmarked more than 1,600 acres of fertile farm land along a river flowing to its eastern coast for a medical tourism hub. Since then fishing villages and rice paddies are slowly being replaced by palm-tree-flanked driveways. The zone’s first hospitals are opening their doors this summer, the effective beginning of this medical experiment. Local officials say businesses have already committed to spending 23 billion yuan ($3.3 billion) for 27 projects ranging from hospitals to plastic surgery clinics, with dozens more awaiting approval. The mission is partly to "retain domestic consumption," the government body managing the Hainan Boao Lecheng International Medical Tourism Pilot Zone said in e-mailed comments.

In an early example, the zone’s Chengmei International Health Center imported 24 vials of the Merck & Co. cancer drug Keytruda for six patients under the special access channel last October, the government says. The medicine is approved in the U.S. and elsewhere, but remains unavailable in the mainland. The special permits by the Chinese regulator only allow for a small amount of the drug to be used in the tourism hub, and it can’t be distributed elsewhere. Merck in a statement said it’s conducting clinical trials on Keytruda in China and doesn’t sell the drug in the country. The China Food and Drug Administration and Chengmei didn’t respond to a request for comment. Ghost Towns By 2025, the hub’s managers want to draw more than one million tourists a year on health-related visits. Still, China has a patchy record of managing specialized economic zones. Centers like Shenzhen, the fishing-village-turned metropolis, have thrived. But others have had a quick boom and bust, like the Caofeidian industrial zone in the northeast, which ended up as a ghost town. The Hainan medical hub’s relatively remote location and the country’s shortage of qualified doctors make it harder to draw patients. Competition for medical resources is fierce, said Chen Bo, associate partner at consultancy McKinsey & Co. Read also: Interactive map shows safest, riskiest destinations to visit “Building health-care capabilities there will require attracting excellent talent to work and live in the pilot zone, and good doctors are already badly needed in China’s major cities,” said Chen. On a recent visit, the area still had the feel of an underdeveloped backwater, showing the challenges to transforming it into a flourishing tourist center. It is dotted with semi-finished hospitals that remain under construction, without medical equipment inside and prefabricated homes outside for construction workers. By the end of March, five facilities had begun operating on a trial basis, local officials say. Evergrande has said it plans to spend 5 billion yuan on its cancer hospital there. Brigham and Women’s hospital in an e-mailed statement said it is serving as a strategic advisor as Evergrande expands its health-care network in China, helping the development of clinical programs and other aspects like training. The hospital was slated to start operating by the end of June, according to a press release on Evergrande’s website. In late March, balloons and banners adorned the hospital’s front gate to celebrate a soft launch of the facility while a quick glance inside the bronze-colored building from a back entrance showed dark rooms with bare concrete walls, unpacked crates and cement piles. Off the main street, behind the hospital pilot zone, was a side road yet to be paved with plywood and empty barrels of asphalt scattered around. Evergrande didn’t respond to a request for comment on the new facility. Read also: Scientists race to prevent wipeout of world's coral reefs Li Peijuan, an analyst at Forward Industries Institute, a Chinese research firm, said the area can benefit from Hainan island’s environmental beauty, but the quality of service, the standard of medical technology as well as costs will ultimately be key to its success. Foreign medicines have in the past taken longer to reach the Asian country partly because the regulator has been understaffed and so struggled to shepherd surging numbers of drug applications through its complex review process. The China Food and Drug Administration is now in the midst of dramatic reforms to its approval system to reduce the so-called “drug lag” on the mainland. If that succeeds, Hainan will need to find other selling points. “It was very appealing a few years back when approval of innovative drugs was relatively slow, but if the pilot zone can’t build full-fledged medical teams and business models in the next two to three years, its attractiveness will be greatly weakened,” said McKinsey’s Chen. — With assistance by Hui Li, and Jing Yang De Morel most viewed most shared Greenfields launches second milk factory Lippo to build new city worth Rp 278 trillion Kartini inspires women to promote Indonesia in US Jakartans call for help against radicalism Indonesia needs to reduce dependency on milk imports: Minister Indonesian textile industry facing competition from Ethiopia Indonesia to speed up negotiation with Freeport Indonesian Navy finds missing Singaporean yacht Indonesia gears up for bilateral, multilateral meetings in US Cheap markets to open ahead of Ramadhan in Depok follow us       NEWS     JOBS   TRAVEL   LIFE   NEWS PULSE #KPKAcidAttack #JakartaGubernatorialElection #Editorial #commentary #WorldPressFreedomDay Join the discussions Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

These drugs treat infectious diseases caused by gram positive, gram negative, aerobic and anaerobic bacteria that cannot be treated by any other method unlike other diseases. Antibacterial drugs have several mechanisms of action, including inhibiting cell wall synthesis, increasing cell membrane permeability, interfering with protein synthesis, nucleic acid metabolism, and other metabolic processes. The alarming antibacterial-resistance crisis has penetrated the awareness of clinicians, researchers, policymakers, governments and the public at large. The key factors assisting the growth of antibacterial drugs market are mounting prevalence of infectious diseases, government support, and increased research and development activities. However, evolving drug-resistant species, launch of generics, and upcoming patent expirations are anticipated to restrict the growth of the global market through 2022. Globally, the rise in geriatric population is also being considered as one of the key growth factors as it will indirectly increase the demand for various antibacterial drugs. The demand for antibacterial drugs will continue to rise mainly due to increased prevalence of resistant species that demand development of innovative molecules. Pipeline Analysis The phase III drugs included in the pipeline analysis are solithromycin (Cempra, Inc.), VivaGel/ SPL7013 (Starpharma Holdings Limited), surotomycin (Merck & Co.), MK-3415A (Merck & Co.) and others. According to market experts, these upcoming drugs assure to provide enhanced efficacy, shorter onset of action and fewer side effects as compared to the currently available antibacterial drugs. Thus, future commercialization of these drugs during the forecast period 2016 – 2022 is anticipated to have a reflective impact on the growth of the overall antibacterial drugs market.

Deals in Pharma, Biotech and Diagnostics 2010-2017 report provides a detailed understanding and analysis of how and why companies enter business, product, technology and royalty asset purchase deals News provided by ReportBuyer 04 May, 2017, 13:42 ET Share this article LONDON, May 4, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Download the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3812932/ Description The Global Asset Purchase Deals in Pharma, Biotech and Diagnostics 2010-2017 report provides a detailed understanding and analysis of how and why companies enter business, product, technology and royalty assets. The report provides a detailed understanding and analysis of how and why companies enter business, product, technology and royalty assets. The focus of the report is on partnerships for business, product, technology and royalty assets where partners have entered an agreement to dispose of or acquire said assets. Companies may seek to dispose of an asset simply because it is surplus to requirements. Or it may seek to dispose of assets in order to raise funds to invest in others parts of its business. Or it may be due to a regulatory requirement to dispose of certain business or product assets as a result of a pending business merger in order to meet competition regulations. The report provides access to asset purchase deal payment terms as announced between the parties. This data provides useful insight into the payment and other deal terms. The report focuses on four primary types of asset available for purchase: Business assets - the most common asset exchanging hands. Business assets are in the form of a business unit or subsidiary of a parent company. Common assets include territorial businesses or non-core businesses such as an OTC or diagnostics business, separate from the core business operations Product assets - in the form of marketed product, clinical phase development compound, or drug delivery-compound combination. These assets are commonly available as a result of a merger or change in direction of the selling company. The buyer acquires the asset for global or territorial exploitation. It is often the case that the acquiring company is normally a competitor to the seller, but in this situation the trade is of mutual benefit Royalty assets - where a specialist investment company acquires the rights to future royalty payments in return for payment of a lump sum payment to the licensor for the product Technology asset - where a buyer is acquiring a technology platform, research program, patent portfolio or other intellectual property asset. The acquisition is often due to the technology being surplus to a sellers interests, but may also be as a consequence of a sale of assets in advance of the seller entering liquidation Understanding the flexibility of a prospective partner's negotiated deals terms provides critical insight into the negotiation process in terms of what you can expect to achieve during the negotiation of terms.

This report provides details of the latest licensing agreements announced in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic sectors. Fully up to date, the report provides details of licensing agreements from 2010 to 2017. There has been a long standing willingness for parties to enter licensing deals. Such deals enable both parties to benefit from the upside of a big R&D win, whilst mitigating the risks of going it alone in the risky preclinical and clinical development stages. Licensing is a specific type of partnering deal whereby the parties to the deal agree to commercialize a compound, product or technology. Specifically, licensing is the granting of permission to use intellectual property rights, such as trademarks, patents, or technology, under defined conditions There are several forms of licensing deal. Traditional licensing arrangement whereby an owner of intellectual property (the licensor) provides access to its technology to another company (the licensee) in return for agreed payments and royalties on subsequent sales of product(s) derived from the intellectual property. In more recent times, licensing is often the outcome of a successful period of collaboration on the research and development of a technology or compound, resulting in a product which can be commercialized. In this situation, the licensing agreement governs who has permission to commercialize and what payments are due should commercialization proceed. Other forms of licensing such as sub-licensing and cross-licensing are also explored, with examples provided together with listing of recent deals in pharma, biotech and diagnostics. The report provides a detailed understand and analysis of how and why companies enter licensing deals. The majority of deals are multicomponent whereby the licensee retains either a right or option to license to commercialize the resultant product of the research collaboration. There are also numerous pure licensing deals whereby the products originator takes on a development/commercialization partner in order to maximize a technologies/products prospects.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Global Asset Purchase Partnering Terms and Agreements in Pharma, Biotech and Diagnostics 2010 to 2016 LONDON, May 4, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Download the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3812932/ Description The Global Asset Purchase Deals in Pharma, Biotech and Diagnostics 2010-2017 report provides a detailed understanding and analysis of how and why companies enter business, product, technology and royalty assets. The report provides a detailed understanding and analysis of how and why companies enter business, product, technology and royalty assets. The focus of the report is on partnerships for business, product, technology and royalty assets where partners have entered an agreement to dispose of or acquire said assets. Companies may seek to dispose of an asset simply because it is surplus to requirements. Or it may seek to dispose of assets in order to raise funds to invest in others parts of its business. Or it may be due to a regulatory requirement to dispose of certain business or product assets as a result of a pending business merger in order to meet competition regulations. The report provides access to asset purchase deal payment terms as announced between the parties. This data provides useful insight into the payment and other deal terms. The report focuses on four primary types of asset available for purchase: Business assets – the most common asset exchanging hands. Business assets are in the form of a business unit or subsidiary of a parent company. Common assets include territorial businesses or non-core businesses such as an OTC or diagnostics business, separate from the core business operations Product assets – in the form of marketed product, clinical phase development compound, or drug delivery-compound combination. These assets are commonly available as a result of a merger or change in direction of the selling company. The buyer acquires the asset for global or territorial exploitation. It is often the case that the acquiring company is normally a competitor to the seller, but in this situation the trade is of mutual benefit Royalty assets – where a specialist investment company acquires the rights to future royalty payments in return for payment of a lump sum payment to the licensor for the product Technology asset – where a buyer is acquiring a technology platform, research program, patent portfolio or other intellectual property asset. The acquisition is often due to the technology being surplus to a sellers interests, but may also be as a consequence of a sale of assets in advance of the seller entering liquidation Understanding the flexibility of a prospective partner’s negotiated deals terms provides critical insight into the negotiation process in terms of what you can expect to achieve during the negotiation of terms.

Fully revised and updated, the report provides details of distribution agreements from 2010 to 2017. The report provides a detailed understanding and analysis of how and why companies enter distribution deals. The majority of deals are multicomponent whereby the licensor retains either a right or option to distribute the resultant product of the research collaboration. There are also numerous pure distribution deals whereby the products originator takes on a distribution partner in order to maximize a products presence in the marketplace. Understanding the flexibility of a prospective partner’s negotiated deals terms provides critical insight into the negotiation process in terms of what you can expect to achieve during the negotiation of terms. Whilst many smaller companies will be seeking details of the payments clauses, the devil is in the detail in terms of how payments are triggered – contract documents provide this insight where press releases and databases do not.

Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the report, whilst chapter 2 provides an overview and analysis of the trends in distribution as well as a discussion on the merits of the type of deal. Chapter 3 provides an overview of the structure of distribution deals. The chapter includes numerous case studies to enable understanding of both pure distribution deals and multicomponent deals where distribution forms a part. Chapter 4 provides a review of the leading distribution deals since 2010. Deals are listed by headline value. Where the deal has an agreement contract published at the SEC a link provides online access to the contract via the Current Agreements deals and alliances database. Chapter 5 provides a comprehensive listing of the top 50 most active distribution dealmaker companies. Each deal title links via Current Agreements deals and alliances database to an online version of the full deal record, and where available, the actual contract document, providing easy access to each deal record on demand.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Boubacar Diallo and Krista Larson | AP By Boubacar Diallo and Krista Larson | AP May 4 at 12:52 PM CONAKRY, Guinea — The head of the World Health Organization praised Guineans on Thursday for their role in helping to develop a vaccine against the deadly Ebola virus, as Guinea’s president said he hoped the vaccine eventually could be produced in Africa. During a visit to the country where the deadliest Ebola epidemic ever first emerged, Dr. Margaret Chan met with health workers who were critical in the fight against the virus. More than 11,300 people died across West Africa before the outbreak was finally declared over last year. Chan said Guineans had “fought back” by taking part in the vaccine trials despite the widespread fear of international health workers that was prevalent during the Ebola crisis. With no specific drugs approved to treat Ebola, patients could only be isolated and the death rate was high. While the vaccine can only protect against contracting the disease and can’t treat it, health officials have praised the vaccine’s development as a major milestone. WHO has said some 300,000 doses of the vaccine initially will be made available in case of another outbreak. Guinean President Alpha Conde said he wants the vaccine and others like it to be produced in Africa. “We want this process to lead to the local production of drugs and vaccines in Africa,” he said at the event. The Ebola virus first turned up on the continent in 1976 and had caused periodic outbreaks mostly in central Africa before the West Africa epidemic began in 2013. Previous attempts at a vaccine failed, in part due to the sporadic nature of outbreaks and funding shortages. The West African epidemic allowed researchers to test the vaccine’s efficacy on about 5,800 people, all of whom had some contact with an Ebola patient. The vaccine, which contains no live virus, proved so effective that the study was stopped midway so that everyone exposed to Ebola in Guinea could be immunized. Researchers still need further study about the vaccine’s safety for children. WHO, which has acknowledged shortcomings in its response to the Ebola outbreak, led the study of the vaccine. The vaccine was developed by the Canadian government and is now licensed to the U.S.-based Merck & Co. Merck is expected to seek regulatory approval in the U.S. and Europe sometime next year. Chan said the efforts to create an Ebola vaccine in months, not years, created a “spillover effect” that will help speed up the development of other vaccines. A new coalition is putting together a system to help ensure “that price is not a barrier to access for populations most in need,” she said. ___ Larson reported from Dakar, Senegal.

During a visit to the country where the deadliest Ebola epidemic ever first emerged, Dr. Margaret Chan met with health workers who were critical in the fight against the virus. More than 11,300 people died across West Africa before the outbreak was finally declared over last year. Chan said Guineans had "fought back" by taking part in the vaccine trials despite the widespread fear of international health workers that was prevalent during the Ebola crisis. With no specific drugs approved to treat Ebola, patients could only be isolated and the death rate was high. While the vaccine can only protect against contracting the disease and can't treat it, health officials have praised the vaccine's development as a major milestone. WHO has said some 300,000 doses of the vaccine initially will be made available in case of another outbreak. Guinean President Alpha Conde said he wants the vaccine and others like it to be produced in Africa. "We want this process to lead to the local production of drugs and vaccines in Africa," he said at the event. The Ebola virus first turned up on the continent in 1976 and had caused periodic outbreaks mostly in central Africa before the West Africa epidemic began in 2013. Previous attempts at a vaccine failed, in part due to the sporadic nature of outbreaks and funding shortages. The West African epidemic allowed researchers to test the vaccine's efficacy on about 5,800 people, all of whom had some contact with an Ebola patient. The vaccine, which contains no live virus, proved so effective that the study was stopped midway so that everyone exposed to Ebola in Guinea could be immunized. Researchers still need further study about the vaccine's safety for children. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

(Cellou Binani/AFP/Getty Images) Related Stories Canadian-developed Ebola vaccine highly effective, clinical trial shows Canadian doctor Rob Fowler recognized for life-saving treatment in Ebola outbreak The head of the World Health Organization praised Guineans on Thursday for their role in helping to develop a vaccine against the deadly Ebola virus, as Guinea's president said he hoped the vaccine eventually could be produced in Africa. During a visit to the country where the deadliest Ebola epidemic ever first emerged, Dr. Margaret Chan met with health workers who were critical in the fight against the virus. More than 11,300 people died across West Africa before the outbreak was finally declared over last year. 'Phenomenal news': Large clinical trial confirms Ebola vaccine is highly effective Chan said Guineans had "fought back" by taking part in the vaccine trials despite the widespread fear of international health workers that was prevalent during the Ebola crisis. With no specific drugs approved to treat Ebola, patients could only be isolated and the death rate was high. While the vaccine can only protect against contracting the disease and can't treat it, health officials have praised the vaccine's development as a major milestone. WHO has said some 300,000 doses of the vaccine initially will be made available in case of another outbreak. Guinean President Alpha Conde said he wants the vaccine and others like it to be produced in Africa. "We want this process to lead to the local production of drugs and vaccines in Africa," he said at the event.
