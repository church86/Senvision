Moderate-to-Severe Plaque Psoriasis Pivotal Data of the Targeted IL-23p19 Antibody to be Presented for the First Time at the 25th European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Congress News provided by Sun Pharma Oct 01, 2016, 05:05 ET Share this article MUMBAI, India and PRINCETON, N.J., Oct. 1, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Sun Pharma (Reuters: SUN.BO, Bloomberg: SUNP IN, NSE: SUNPHARMA, BSE: 524715, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and includes its subsidiaries or associate companies, through its wholly owned subsidiary) today will announce late-breaking data from two pivotal Phase-3 clinical trials (reSURFACE 1 and 2) achieving the primary endpoint with tildrakizumab, an investigational IL-23p19 inhibitor, in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis at the 25th European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Congress in Vienna, Austria. As indicated in a previous press release, top line results from these studies were announced on May 4, 2016. The Phase-3 data results through week 28 are being presented for the first time as part of the "Late Breaking News" Session at the premier European dermatology conference where the latest in research and developments in the field are presented each year.  Tildrakizumab clinical trials included over 1,800 patients from more than 200 clinical trial sites worldwide. In the trials, an average of 63 percent of patients achieved 75 percent of skin clearance (Psoriasis Area Sensitivity Index or PASI 75) by week 12 after only two injections, and 77 percent achieved 75 percent skin clearance after 28 weeks and three injections of the 100 mg dose of tildrakizumab (64 percent and 80 percent in reSURFACE 1, 61 percent and 74 percent in reSURFACE 2). Similarly, an average of 57 percent and 66 percent of patients had a Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) score of "clear" or "minimal" with the 100 mg dose at weeks 12 and 28 respectively. Those receiving the 200 mg dose also saw an average of 64 percent and 78 percent of patients achieving PASI 75 at weeks 12 and 28 respectively.  Also, 59 percent and 69 percent of the patients had PGA score of "clear" or "minimal" at weeks 12 and 28 respectively.  The data further showed that a higher number of patients on tildrakizumab achieved PASI 90 and 100 compared to placebo and etanercept. An average of 37 percent and 36 percent of patients on tildrakizumab achieved PASI 90 at week 12 with the 100 mg dose and 200 mg dose respectively which increased to 54 percent and 59 percent at week 28. Correspondingly, an average of 13 percent on tildrakizumab achieved PASI 100 at week 12 regardless of dose with an increase to 24 percent for the 100 mg dose and 30 percent for the 200 mg dose at week 28. The overall safety profile of tildrakizumab in both Phase-3 clinical trials was consistent with the safety data observed in previously reported studies. The incidences of severe infections, malignancies, and extended major cardiovascular events (MACE) were low and similar across treatment groups (1-3 percent). "For patients with psoriasis, their condition is always top of mind and they struggle on a daily basis with the often debilitating effects of this chronic condition. In our studies, we saw that the targeted effects of tildrakizumab significantly improved skin clearance offering a potential new treatment option for many patients with quarterly dosing," said Dr. Kristian Reich, Professor of Dermatology at the Georg-August-University Göttingen and inflammation specialist at the Dermatologikum Hamburg in Germany. "We are excited about these Phase-3 tildrakizumab results that further validate the central role of IL-23 as a key regulatory cytokine and treatment target in psoriasis. Tildrakizumab has the potential to be a new treatment that helps people living with moderate-to-severe psoriasis," said Jesper Jensen, Executive Vice President, Biologics and Dermatology, Sun Pharma. "At Sun Dermatology, we care to make a difference and seek to match our products and solutions making them accessible and available to patients and health care providers with unmet needs." Additional findings from the Phase-3 clinical trials will be presented at upcoming scientific meetings and the preparations for regulatory submissions in both the U.S. and Europe are proceeding. In July 2016, Sun Pharma had announced a strategic licensing agreement with Almirall S.A (Spain) on the development and commercialization of tildrakizumab for psoriasis in Europe. About Psoriasis Psoriasis is a chronic immune disease that appears on the skin. It affects an estimated 7.5 million people in the U.S. and approximately 125 million people worldwide1. It is a non-contagious disorder that speeds the growth cycle of skin cells1 and results in thick scaly areas of skin2. The most common form of psoriasis, called plaque psoriasis, appears as red, raised areas of skin covered with flaky white scales, which may be itchy and painful and can crack and bleed2. Despite existing treatment options, many people with plaque psoriasis continue to struggle with the ongoing, persistent nature of this chronic disease impacting their everyday lives. About Tildrakizumab Phase-3 reSURFACE Trial Design Tildrakizumab Phase-3 studies (reSURFACE 1 and 2) are randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies designed to demonstrate efficacy of tildrakizumab in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis compared to placebo and comparative drug and to assess safety and tolerability. The co-primary efficacy endpoint of the two placebo controlled studies were the proportion of patients with Psoriasis Area Sensitivity Index 75 (PASI 75) response at week 12 compared to placebo and the proportion of participants with a Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) score of clear or minimal with at least a 2 grade reduction from baseline at week 12 compared to placebo. The reSURFACE 2 trial also included an etanercept comparator arm, with a key secondary endpoint comparing tildrakizumab and etanercept on PASI 75 and PGA. Other co-secondary endpoints of both placebo controlled studies included PASI 90 and PASI 100 responses at week 12 and PASI 75, 90 and 100 and PGA responses from baseline at Week 28. PGA measures lesion thickness, erythema and scaling across all of a patient's psoriasis lesions in order to determine the disease activity on a six-point scale from "clear" to "severe." A PASI score is a measure of psoriatic plaque redness, scaling and thickness and extent of the involvement in each region of the body. Treatment efficacy is often measured by reduction of PASI from baseline (i.e. 75 percent reduction is known PASI 75, a 90 percent reduction is known as PASI 90 and PASI 100 is total clearance of skin disease). About Tildrakizumab Tildrakizumab is an investigational humanized, anti-IL-23p19 monoclonal antibody designed to selectively block the cytokine IL-23. With this precise targeting, tildrakizumab has the potential to help control the pathogenic cells responsible for the inflammatory process of psoriasis with limited impact on the rest of the immune system.

Published on Saturday, October 01, 2016 by Council of Canadians Why is the U.S. Big Pharma lobby Sponsoring a Conference on the Future of Health Care in Canada? by Michael Butler 0 Comments (Image via Council of Canadians) Over the past two days a major health care summit has occurred in Ottawa at the Chateau Laurier Hotel. The summit, titled “A New Health Accord for All Canadians,” is a partnership between the Canada 2020 think tank and the Canadian Medical Association (CMA). This summit featured variety of stakeholders and speakers including senator Chantal Peticlerc, Dr. Granger Avery the president of the CMA, Dr. Gaétan Barrette the Quebec Minister of Health and Social Services, and Dr. Jane Philpott Canada’s Minister of Health. This summit comes at a pivotal point in the history of medicare with a new health accord being negotiated in coming months and an urgent need for national pharmacare (among many pressing topics). So it comes as some surprise that when looking at this premier health summit the sponsors include a who’s who of the petrochemical, health insurance, banking and pharmaceutical lobby (colloquially big pharma). In particular, one of the sponsors listed is the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the largest US pharmaceutical lobby group.  When we say big pharma, this is generally who is referred to. For a think tank that calls itself independent, this seems like a conflict of interest.  This isn’t to say that there were not independent speakers or important topics that were covered over the two days, but it points to a worrying trend of American corporate interests further creeping into our medicare (not to mention the negative relationship between pharmaceutical promotion and quality, quantity, and cost of physicians' prescribing). When one of the founders of Canada 2020 was questioned about this on twitter, his response to a fair question was pejorative (in fairness he did later apologize somewhat stating he was, “tired, cranky and surprised that we're being pre-judged by progressives!”) Sadly, it doesn’t come as a surprise the Canadian Medical Association (CMA) is involved with the pharma lobby in co-hosting this health summit.  The CMA has a long history of financial ties to big pharma and has in the past taken $780,000 from Pfizer Canada to fund the new "continuing medical education" (Two Pfizer staff members also sat on an administrative board during this time). Further the medical guidelines distributed by the CMA are largely written by authors with financial ties to big pharma. In a study of 350 authors from 28 of the written guidelines, 75% % of the documents had at least one author tied to big pharma; in 21.4 % of the guidelines all authors had a financial conflict of interest (FCOI) with drug companies. Other groups who appear to be in involved include the Canadian pharmaceutical industry lobby group Innovative Medicines Canada (formerly Rx&D) as a facilitator for a panel delivering cost-effective home care. A Merck Canada executive was also involved in introducing & framing a framing another session.  A representative from biopharma company Amgen was the moderator for a panel on the next health accord. Johnson & Johnson, and Amgen were also sponsor along with PhRMA. For those keeping track of the record for the US parent companies involved, Merck is well known for its deadly Vioxx scandal where it was made false or misleading safety claims and has paid out over US$6 billion in settlements. Johnson & Johnson has had to pay US$70 million to settle claims it bribed doctors in Greece, Poland and Romania to prescribe its medicines and, along with its subsidiaries, recently paid more than US$2.2 billion (one of the largest healthcare fraud settlements in US history) involving the drug Risperdal.  Amgen was fined US$762m for illegally off-label illegal promotion of the drug Aranesp to cancer patients in a way that increased the likelihood of their deaths. Essentially, conferences like this are inviting the fox into the medicare henhouse. But perhaps more worrying is the inclusion of PhRMA. In the US they have already spent a near-record $11.7 million in lobbying this year, and have spent nearly $150 million on lobbying since 2008 outspending powerful interests like defense contractors and the oil and gas industry. A recent Gallup poll of public opinion found drug makers are less popular than lawyers and oil companies, and just barely less hated than the federal government in the US (which is saying something). PhRMA which took in more than $200 million in member dues in 2014, and is expected to launch a major PR after the US election. Trying to shed the negative image incurred from industry price gouging scandals like those involving Turing and Valeant Pharmacueticals or the recent Purdue Pharma OxyContin nightmare or the Mylan EpiPen fiasco , PhRMA is planning large ad campaign (i.e. image makeover) in the US using a 5 year old boy and a woman with blood cancer to distance themselves from scandals. The drug industry overall has also spent $171 million on unbranded ads in the US so far this year, up 15 percent over the same period last year (last year drug makers spent a whopping $6 billion on branded and unbranded adds) Oddly, for a group trying to claim the companies that excessively price gouge are outliers, PhRMA recently added two drug companies to its roster (Jazz Pharmaceuticals and Horizon Pharmaceuticals) who have, “relied on excessive pricing to fuel their growth, while investing much less than other drug makers in research and development.” The list could go on, but the point is that this is industry group is extremely powerful and well financed; they will spend breathtaking amounts of money to, “shape policy debates to favour a pharmaceutical company’s profit maximization priorities and negatively impact public health objectives.” So again, does it make sense to have this group sponsor a conference on the future of Canadian health care? It is also worth remembering that on the board of directors for PhRMA is John Lechleiter the Chairman, President, and CEO of Eli Lilly and Company. For those not familiar with this company, Eli Lilly is using the ISDS provisions in NAFTA to sue Canada for $500 million in damages, claiming the decision of the Canadian courts (at multiple levels) on two Lilly products (Strattera and Zyprexa) violated patent law obligations under NAFTA (for more detailed info see here or here). If Eli Lilly succeeds in the case, they will have found a way to override the Supreme Court of Canada and our right to make domestic policy for the benefit of the public. In essence, they are trying to use secretive and opaque ISDS tribunal to re-write Canada’s laws in the favour of their profits. As it stands, Canada has already incurred are $6.5 million dollars fighting this reckless NAFTA challenge. In regard to Canada`s IP laws,the vice president of international affairs at PhRMA has commented, “PhRMA and its member companies operating in Canada are extremely concerned about Canada’s intellectual property environment... we believe that the seriousness of the IP violations in Canada demand particular focus by the US government to address this critical issue.” But it doesn`t stop there. Phrma has created astro-turf campaigns with names like `Protect Patents Protect Patents` to fight the promised utility doctrine (often called just the promise doctrine) which is at the heart of the Eli Lilly NAFTA challenge. Eli Lilly for their part uses their Lilly foundation, and endowment (whose assets come from the company) to donate huge funds to Canadain Pfink think tanks. While this dark money is difficult to track, Eli Lily is a long standing funder of the far-right Fraser Institute.  It is believed they donated $325,000 to the institute in 2010, $600,000 in 2011, totalling $2,792,000 between 2001 and 2012. To the surprise of no one, this institute has published reports that are against the promise doctrine by an author who has worked for PhRMA in the past (strangely this little fact is not included on the FI bio page). As well, a former board member and now lifetime patron was a senior director at Pfizer. So it stands to reason that the serious moral and ethical issues highlighted above are reason enough to not have the leader of Amiercan big pharma as sponsor at a Canadian health care summit.  The reality is undue influence from the pharmaceutical industry often comes from groups accepting large amounts of money from them; it is now secret that when big pharma flexes its financial muscles, they frame the narrative and influence how health policy plays out through proxies. In the case of a summit to discuss the future of medicare in Canada, this amounts to an inherent conflict of interest (especially considering the history of PhRMA). Or as Dr. Peter Gotzsche, the Director of the Nordic Cochrane Center in Copenhagen, has highlighted, “Much of what the drug industry does fulfills the criteria for organized crime in US law... And they behave in many ways like the mafia does, they corrupt everyone they can corrupt, they have bought every type of person, even including ministers of health in some countries.” © 2015 Council of Canadians Michael Butler Michael Butler is the national health campaigner for the Council of Canadians.

Here's why. George Budwell (TMFGBudwell) Sep 30, 2016 at 2:45PM Because of an aging global population, an unprecedented amount of innovation, and wider access to medical services in the United States, the healthcare sector should continue to push higher in the coming years. To take advantage of this rising tide, investors may want to grab shares of Allergan (NYSE:AGN), Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) right now. Here's why.  Image source: Getty Images. Allergan's strong top-line growth won't evaporate anytime soon Under the watchful eye of CEO Brent Saunders, Allergan has transformed into one of the fastest-growing pharma companies in the world. Saunders' trick, so to speak, has been to take an extremely aggressive approach to M&A that has helped the company drive revenue growth primarily through increases in sales volume, rather than politically contentious price hikes. Allergan's less traditional growth-by-acquisition strategy has also allowed the company to largely avoid the expensive late-stage clinical failures that tend to plague large-cap pharmas. Keeping with this growth-by-acquisition approach, Allergan recently announced the buyout of both Akarna Therapeutics Ltd. and Tobira Therapeutics, Inc. These deals are part of Allergan's efforts to break into the multibillion-dollar non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, market. Although neither of these acquisitions comes with a built-in revenue-generating NASH product, these deals clearly demonstrate Allergan's aggressive targeting of high-value commercial opportunities. Digging into the details, Allergan just spent roughly $1.75 billion in up-front payments to dive headfirst into NASH, but that amount pales in comparison to the $40 billion market opportunity industry experts believe this particular liver disease will represent by 2025. That's the type of deal-making that can pay huge dividends for shareholders down the road. Bristol has forged a solid footprint in the high-growth immuno-oncology market By 2024, immunotherapies are forecast to make up around a quarter of the entire cancer drug market, making this space one of the fastest-growing segments of the highflying pharmaceutical industry. Bristol-Myers Squibb, perhaps seeing the writing on the wall, was among the first major drugmakers to pivot toward this rapidly growing space when it brought the game-changing PD-1 inhibitor Opdivo to market and subsequently became the undisputed immuno-oncology market share leader. Although Opdivo could face stiffer competition from Merck's (NYSE:MRK) Keytruda following its recent late-stage failure as a monotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer, this drug should still haul in annual sales in excess of $10 billion within a few short years. Bristol's top line is thus expected to sport high single-digit growth over the next several years as a result of Opdivo's breakout success and numerous label expansions, which include classical Hodgkin's lymphoma and advanced bladder cancer, among others. Perhaps the juiciest part of Bristol's growth story, though, is that Opdivo is far from the only immuno-oncology asset in its arsenal. Besides the already approved anti-CTLA4 antibody Yervoy, Bristol's clinical pipeline is chock-full of compelling, high-value immuno-oncology product candidates and possible label expansions for already approved products:   Image source: Bristol-Myers Squibb. All told, Bristol is well positioned to remain a top player in the immuno-oncology market going forward, even as other big pharmas like Merck vigorously attempt to cut into Bristol's outsized piece of the pie.  Pfizer's modest growth and top-notch dividend shouldn't be ignored Despite some serious setbacks on the M&A front, Pfizer has slowly returned to growth, fueled mainly by the growing sales of the breast cancer treatment Ibrance, the blood thinner Eliquis, and the pneumococcal pneumonia vaccine Prevnar 13. And after its recent acquisition of Medivation for its blockbuster prostate cancer drug Xtandi, Pfizer now sports two of the world's best-selling oncology products. The drugmaker is also hoping to add a third major piece to its oncology franchise with the experimental immunotherapy avelumab, which is in clinical development as a possible treatment for a variety of malignancies, including lung, kidney, and stomach cancer.  Topping it off, Pfizer sports one of the richest dividends among major drugmakers, with a current yield of 3.5%. And now that a split of the company is off the table for the time being, this enticing dividend should be sustainable for the long-haul, given Pfizer's strong cash position and enormous free cash flows of nearly $15 billion over the last 12 months.    Long story short, Pfizer offers solid, though modest, growth prospects and a top-notch dividend, making it a compelling healthcare stock to own right now.  George Budwell owns shares of Allergan and Pfizer.

Bruce Einhorn Subscribe Reprints September 30, 2016 — 7:15 AM EDT Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Photographer: Martin Barraud/Getty Images Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp For decades, drug companies have grown vaccines using chicken eggs. That’s why an outbreak of hen-killing avian flu would be such a nightmare scenario: “The whole world would consume all the chicken eggs within a couple of months,” says Guan Yi, director of the Center of Influenza Research at the University of Hong Kong. “We need to have another option.” The answer may lie in the Raleigh suburb of Holly Springs, N.C., where CSL, an Australian company, is experimenting with growing vaccines in kidney cells taken from dogs. (No harm comes to the dogs; the cell line has been available since 1958, when researchers took tissue from a female cocker spaniel.) While egg-based vaccines have a limited shelf life, CSL—which makes more flu vaccines than anyone besides Sanofi—says it can keep the dog cells on ice in perpetuity, to respond easily to an outbreak. “That’s critical in case of a pandemic, which spreads rapidly,” says Gordon Naylor, president of the company’s vaccine subsidiary, Seqirus. There’s an opening in the $5 billion market for seasonal flu vaccines, of which the U.S. consumes a third. Novartis sold its money-losing vaccine division to CSL for $275 million in 2014. Sanofi and Merck dissolved their flu vaccine joint venture in March. In June the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said AstraZeneca’s FluMist hadn’t been a strong preventive measure for three years. (AstraZeneca has said it’s working with the CDC to resolve the matter.) CSL is one of a few companies betting new technology can help meet the challenge of producing tens of millions of doses in the few months between the World Health Organization’s recommended vaccine targets and the start of flu season. They’re also betting they can make the market more profitable. Using mammalian cells instead of chicken embryos can help create a vaccine faster and more efficiently, says Russell Basser, senior vice president for research and development at Seqirus. The Holly Springs factory can produce as many as 200 million doses of vaccine in six months, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which contributed $700 million to its construction. Dog cells are also cheaper, as little as half the $3.50 cost to make a dose of flu vaccine via egg, estimates UBS analyst Andrew Goodsall. That would make flu shots affordable enough for such countries as Mexico and Brazil, he says. CSL’s dog cells aren’t the only egg alternative. Protein Sciences uses cells from caterpillars at its plant in Rockland County, N.Y. Chief Executive Officer Manon Cox says Protein’s process is faster than egg-based vaccine production, but costs are 5 to 10 times higher. While Protein could make 5 million doses of vaccine this year, Cox says, it expects to sell only 900,000. “The uptake is not there yet,” she says. Another alternative to eggs is Nicotiana benthamiana, an Australian weed that’s a close relative of the tobacco plant. Cigarette maker Reynolds American in 2014 acquired Kentucky BioProcessing, a decade-old company that uses tobacco plants to produce pharmaceutical proteins. Medicago, backed by Philip Morris and Japanese drugmaker Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma, says it can produce 30 million doses of tobacco-based flu vaccine a year at its plant in North Carolina but is awaiting approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Guan, the flu research director, isn’t confident these new technologies will be able to fill the gap if a global pandemic jeopardizes the egg supply. Absent an avian flu-style scenario, egg-based flu vaccine production should readily meet seasonal demand, he says, so investments in alternatives have been a relatively tough sell. For now, CSL can afford to keep trying, while also continuing egg-based operations. Most of the $1.2 billion profit in its most recent fiscal year came from sales of blood plasma products; the vaccine subsidiary accounted for 10 percent of its $6.1 billion in revenue. In May, CSL won FDA approval for a dog cell-based vaccine targeting four strains of seasonal flu, and the company projects it will turn a profit from the division in 2018. “The egg-based platform has been around for a long time,” Naylor says. “I don’t expect there will be an overnight transition.” The bottom line: Upstarts and established drugmakers are testing alternatives to egg-based vaccines in the $5 billion seasonal flu market.

Bristol-Myers Squibb, perhaps seeing the writing on the wall, was among the first major drugmakers to pivot toward this rapidly growing space when it brought the game-changing PD-1 inhibitor Opdivo to market and subsequently became the undisputed immuno-oncology market share leader. Although Opdivo could face stiffer competition from Merck's (NYSE:MRK) Keytruda following its recent late-stage failure as a monotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer, this drug should still haul in annual sales in excess of $10 billion within a few short years. Bristol's top line is thus expected to sport high single-digit growth over the next several years as a result of Opdivo's breakout success and numerous label expansions, which include classical Hodgkin's lymphoma and advanced bladder cancer, among others. Perhaps the juiciest part of Bristol's growth story, though, is that Opdivo is far from the only immuno-oncology asset in its arsenal. Besides the already approved anti-CTLA4 antibody Yervoy, Bristol's clinical pipeline is chock-full of compelling, high-value immuno-oncology product candidates and possible label expansions for already approved products:   Image source: Bristol-Myers Squibb. All told, Bristol is well positioned to remain a top player in the immuno-oncology market going forward, even as other big pharmas like Merck vigorously attempt to cut into Bristol's outsized piece of the pie.  Pfizer's modest growth and top-notch dividend shouldn't be ignored Despite some serious setbacks on the M&A front, Pfizer has slowly returned to growth, fueled mainly by the growing sales of the breast cancer treatment Ibrance, the blood thinner Eliquis, and the pneumococcal pneumonia vaccine Prevnar 13. And after its recent acquisition of Medivation for its blockbuster prostate cancer drug Xtandi, Pfizer now sports two of the world's best-selling oncology products. The drugmaker is also hoping to add a third major piece to its oncology franchise with the experimental immunotherapy avelumab, which is in clinical development as a possible treatment for a variety of malignancies, including lung, kidney, and stomach cancer.  Topping it off, Pfizer sports one of the richest dividends among major drugmakers, with a current yield of 3.5%. And now that a split of the company is off the table for the time being, this enticing dividend should be sustainable for the long-haul, given Pfizer's strong cash position and enormous free cash flows of nearly $15 billion over the last 12 months.    Long story short, Pfizer offers solid, though modest, growth prospects and a top-notch dividend, making it a compelling healthcare stock to own right now.  George Budwell owns shares of Allergan and Pfizer.

X Ireland’s only living Nobel scientist honoured at Trinity College Honours for worm expert William C Campbell at university where he studied in 1950s Fri, Sep 30, 2016, 14:47 Updated: Fri, Sep 30, 2016, 14:53 Ciarán D'Arcy Video Images Ireland’s only living Nobel laureate scientist, celebrated parasitologist William C Campbell, enjoyed a poignant homecoming at Trinity College on Friday - the university where he studied as an undergraduate in the 1950s. Video: TCD Celebrated parasitologist William C Campbell has enjoyed a poignant homecoming at his alma mater, Trinity College Dublin. File photograph: CJ Gunther/EPA         Ireland’s only living Nobel laureate scientist, William C Campbell, enjoyed a poignant homecoming at Trinity College on Friday - the university where he studied as an undergraduate in the 1950s. The celebrated parasitologist was honoured by the Nobel Committee which last year awarded the prize for medicine to him and fellow scientist Satoshi Omura for their work in defeating the roundworm, which causes river blindness. That disease - which still affects some 25 million people, mostly in developing countries - is now in decline. At a ceremony at Trinity College, Provost Patrick Prendergast announced the establishment of the William C Campbell lectureship in parasite biology. Joy expressed In a brief but emotional oration, the Donegal man, who was surrounded by friends, family and colleagues of old, expressed his joy at being invited back to the institution he has such a strong connection to. “One of the first letters I sent home when I crossed the seas said that there’s no other university I would rather have been to. I’d rather have gone to here than any other university,” he said, tearfully. Irish man’s Nobel win highlights the glacial nature of science Irish-born William C Campbell awarded the Nobel prize Campbell ‘delighted’ as he receives Nobel prize in Stockholm Campbell’s critical discovery of worm-killing avermectin was made while working as a researcher with pharmaceutical giant Merck in New Jersey after earning a PhD from the University of Wisconsin, but he reserved special praise for his Trinity mentor, Desmond Smyth. “I’ve had the great good fortune to come under the influence of Desmond Smyth, who was a special person, and who fostered my interest in parasitic worms, and I have been attached to parasitic worms ever since,” he said, mixing humour with poignancy. “I feel so strongly about them, I write poems about them, I paint pictures of them. Worms ‘are brilliant’ “I just think they are wonderful, they’re brilliant, they have incredible diversity - and in fact I have no problem reconciling the fact that I love worms but have spent half my life trying to kill them,” he quipped. ADVERTISEMENT Mr Prendergast told the audience “Bill” Campbell’s story had a broader resonance, especially considering the decision to make the patented ivermectin drug, a derivative of avermectin, free to those who need it. “It speaks of the importance of donating drugs where they’re needed. It speaks of the importance of respecting basic research,” he said. Trinity College professor of zoology Celia Holland added: “Bill’s achievement has been fundamentally important to that whole issue of these diseases which were forgotten. “They were the diseases of forgotten people, they were diseases of the disadvantaged - and now they’re coming into the light.” Adaptable, cunning, resourceful She concluded by quoting renowned US scientist John Janovy jnr in saying parasitologists are like coyotes: adaptable, cunning and resourceful. “In the most respectful sense, I salute the greatest coyote,” she said in the direction of Prof Campbell, amid rapturous applause.       Topics: Celia Holland Ciaran D Arcy Ireland Desmond Smyth John Janovy Patrick Prendergast Prof Campbell Satoshi Omura Trinity Provost Nobel Committee Trinity College University Of Wisconsin Merck Donegal New Jersey Read More Nobel prize comes dropping slow for William Campbell William C Campbell warns of decline in scientific research Prize parasites: how an Irish man won the Nobel More from The Irish Times Health ‘Serious concern’ about work of Galway surgeon Opinion Una Mullally: I never liked Facebook, but now I am actually worried about it English Soccer Liberation!

Politicians love to pick on pharmaceutical companies, and they can be an easy target during campaign season. At the end of the day, they will survive and continue to grow and, best of all, pay dependable dividends. A new report from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey has an end-of-the-quarter sector update on large cap pharmaceuticals. Five companies are mentioned in the report, and three of them are rated Buy. We highlight the three stocks that are favorites at SunTrust. AbbVie This is one of the top global pharmaceutical stocks picks across Wall Street. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV) is a global, research-based biopharmaceutical company formed in 2013 following separation from Abbott Laboratories. The company’s mission is to use its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world’s most complex and serious diseases. AbbVie employs more than 26,000 people worldwide and markets medicines in more than 170 countries. One of the biggest concerns with AbbVie is what eventually might happen with anti-inflammatory therapy Humira, which generated $14 billion in sales in fiscal 2015. That was the most any drug has recorded during a single year and represents a gigantic part of the company’s overall earnings. The problem is that biosimilars and generics are itching to enter the market with Amgen leading the charge, and some Wall Street analysts project that AbbVie may have a difficult time stopping that trend. Back in May, the patent board instituted Coherus BioSciences’ Inter Partes Review against the Humira ‘135 patent. The outcome of the review is expected in 12 months. While most analysts remain positive on Humira duration, the expected litigation uncertainty could continue to create an overhang on the stock, which does give investors chances to pick up shares lower. The SunTrust team notes that the stock trades at a small discount to its large pharmaceutical peers, and they cite the biosimilar issue as a likely reason why. They also think some on Wall Street are still less than thrilled over the steep price the company paid to buy Pharmacyclics. AbbVie investors receive a 3.63% dividend. The SunTrust price target for the stock is $85, and the Wall Street consensus target is $71.28 Shares closed Thursday at $62.88. Eli Lilly This is another company with substantial upside potential. Eli Lilly and Co. (NYSE: LLY) is a global health care company with numerous core products in a number of primary-care pharmaceutical markets. The company generates revenues from its pharmaceutical product and animal health segments. The product portfolio includes Zyprexa (for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder), Gemzar (pancreatic cancer), Evista (osteoporosis), Cymbalta (depression), Cialis (erectile dysfunction), Strattera (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), Erbitux (cancer) and Alimta (chemotherapy). Eli Lilly also has a strong presence in the diabetes market.

I’m not sure who or what to blame and the source of the disorder is irrelevant; it’s the cure I’m after. Has your foot ever fallen asleep? How about just your pinky toe? How long will you let your pinky toe feel numb before googling it? Or will you even notice at all? I’m perpetually amazed at how we exist in a world where people could carry a pregnancy unknowingly alongside people like me who notice a pin-prick size bite or a new freckle emerge among millions. I swear to feel my egg drop each month and I promise I can feel it traveling down my fallopian tube. I’m not claiming it’s painful; I’m simply acknowledging I feel it and I am hyper-aware of it. This hypersensitivity is called body vigilance. It means I feel any little thing even if it’s just my body being alive, and I take it to the extreme. More: I hate my panic attacks, but I hate the medication that stops them, too My brain engages in a civil war. The fear team versus the logic team. Even though my logic team is armed with more data than my fear team, the latter plays dirty by shooting out deadly 'what if' arrows into the ring, completely leveling the field. For every logical comment my brain uses to assuage the fear, the ‘what-ifs’ throw something in to make me doubt myself. What if just this time it is a heart attack? What if just this time it is a blood clot in my lungs? What if just this time that little lip twitch is an early indicator of Multiple Sclerosis? Or Muscular Dystrophy? (I always confused them, but am terrified of both equally.) Keep in mind, I am a smart, educated person who understands, appreciates and is fascinated by biology (my favorite science). When my grandfather was diagnosed with throat cancer, I scoured the Internet for everything there was to know about the disease, the treatment, and the recovery. When my grandmother was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm, she asked how long it had been there and they told her they had no idea, probably years. She said, "If I’ve been walking around with it for years, I’ll continue to walk around with it.” I am not that person. I would think of nothing other than that growing blood clot pushing on my brain. I would not sleep because I would be sure it would pop in my sleep or when I coughed or screamed or yelled. More: I worry I'm living vicariously through my kids by giving them the opportunities I never had I have a bunch of theories about where my hypochondria came from. For example, throughout my childhood, my mother perpetually complained of a bad heart and threatened to faint, falling back on her stash of smelling salts in her purse. The best birthday present I ever got was the Merck Medical Manual, which I read cover to cover like a gripping mystery novel. The internet has only made it worse — type in a symptom and it’ll provide evidence to substantiate any cancer diagnosis, or MS or blood clot or an aneurysm de jour. And I've always been haunted by the tragic stories which make you feel powerless and helpless. The healthy marathon runner who never smoked a day in his life with no family history and plagued with lung cancer. For years, I thought the momentary sharp pain I got “under my breast” was a heart attack warning. I thought back to my mother grabbing her chest and yelling out in Russian, “koleet,” which translates to “it’s piercing.” She’d gasp for breath and occasionally ask for the smelling salts but the pain was always gone soon after with no real repercussion or follow up. She never went to a cardiologist but told me the story about how she had scarlet fever as a child and it has lasting effects on her heart. She had us all convinced she had a bad heart, but now I realize she just had gas. She also spewed the rhetoric how her “B” blood type was a lower caliber blood, secondary to “A” blood type. “I have the weaker blood type," she would tell me, "not like your father. Thank goodness you have A positive like him.” Turns out we both have O positive. When I take things to the extreme, I know I’m trying to gain control because ultimately fear is controlling my hypochondriac symptoms. Somehow my brain believes if I discover it early enough, if I prepare well enough, if I get to the hospital fast enough, I’ll save myself. The older I get, the worse it is. I’ve spent so many years worrying about these possible horrific diseases without getting them, I’m sure my time is coming. Why else has life been preparing me for all these diseases? I wait and wait, wasting all my time fearing when I could have been grateful for every day without pain. I could be appreciating every day that I am not aware of something secretly growing inside me. The fear can be paralyzing. It’s dangerous in the world with terrible texting drivers and drunk people at a concert who might trample me and ticking bombs in random dumpsters, but fear is just a self-induced terrorist which imprisons me with limitations. A therapist tried to help me with my brain’s propensity to rapidly accelerate towards the worst case scenario. She tried to teach me if I find a small lump on my arm, for instance, I shouldn’t instantly google “arm cancer,” and instead just be aware of it and monitor it for a few days to see if perhaps it was just a mosquito bite and will go away. Her goal was to modify my behavior to delay the panic release. Over time, I’ve learned that I have to understand the difference between pain and sensation. Awareness does not necessarily indicate a symptom of something else, it is a reminder my heart is beating and I am breathing. I’m also not the type of hypochondriac who incessantly visits the doctor; I’m too afraid they will find something and also, I don’t trust them. I feel like a floating molecule through space waiting to be struck by something. I walk through life avoiding the diseases like walking between the raindrops. I am in an abusive relationship with hypochondria. I desperately want to get away from it, but somehow it controls my brain.

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ NEW DELHI: Indian drug maker Sun Pharma today announced late-breaking data from two pivotal Phase-3 clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of anti-psoriasis drug tildrakizumab. In May, the company had announced positive results from the firt 12 weeks of the two trials in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The company has now shared additional data on the trials at 28 weeks. Tildrakizumab is a monoclonal antibody designed to control the pathogenic cells responsible for the inflammatory process of psoriasis with limited impact on the rest of the immune system. Additional findings from the Phase-3 clinical trials will be presented at upcoming scientific meetings and the preparations for regulatory submissions in both the US and Europe are proceeding, stated the company in a release. Tildrakizumab clinical trials, which included over 1,800 patients from more than 200 clinical trial sites worldwide, showed an average of 63% patients achieved 75% skin clearance within 12 weeks after only two injections, said the release. The company added that 77% achieved the same results after 28 weeks through three injections of the 100 mg dose of tildrakizumab. An average of 57% and 66% patients had a Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) score of “clear” or “minimal” with the 100 mg dose at weeks 12 and 28 respectively, said Sun Pharma. The overall safety profile of tildrakizumab in both Phase-3 clinical trials was consistent with the safety data observed in previously reported studies, said the company. "The incidences of severe infections, malignancies, and extended major cardiovascular events (MACE) were low and similar across treatment groups (1%-3%)," it said. "The Phase-3 data results through week 28 are being presented for the first time as part of the “Late Breaking News” Session at the premier European dermatology conference where the latest in research and developments in the field are presented each year," it added. The psoriasis market is set to more than double to $13.3 billion by 2024 from $6.6 billion in 2014, according to UK-based research and consulting firm GlobalData. Sun Pharma acquired worldwide rights to tildrakizumab from US drug giant Merck & Co, known as Merck Sharpe and Dohme (MSD) outside the US and Canada, in 2014. Funded by Sun Pharma, Merck is responsible for the completion of phase-3 trials in patients with mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis, and submission of a Biologics License Application to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is also responsible for manufacturing finished goods to support Sun Pharma’s initial product launch, according to the company. In July 2016, Sun Pharma had announced a strategic licensing agreement with Almirall S.A (Spain) on the development and commercialization of tildrakizumab for psoriasis in Europe.

(AP File Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)   Alex Webb Bloomberg     So far Apple's HealthKit has mostly collected fitness data from its devices. In the future, if the company gets its way, the software will interpret that information, turning it into advice for users, doctors and others. Scores of health-care experts hired by Apple in recent years are building improved electronic health record software that can better analyze and understand the implications of patient data, according to people familiar with the team's plans. The iPhone maker is also working on new apps for the Apple Watch. One helps users track sleep patterns, one of the people said. Another app gauges fitness levels by measuring the time taken for the heart rate to fall from its peak to resting level, according to one of the other people. Apple already has an app that measures heart rate, but doesn't interpret that data. The ultimate goal of Apple's medical technology team is to turn HealthKit into a tool that improves diagnoses, the people said. The system could chip away at two problems that plague the industry and have stumped other specialist firms in the field: interoperability -- allowing data to be transferred from hospital to hospital across different databases; and analysis -- making it quick and easy for physicians to extrapolate salient information from mountains of data. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook wants Apple to do more in software and services to secure new sources of revenue and make customers more dependent on the company's devices. The $8 trillion global health-care industry is a big opportunity. "If you drive for a while and your car gets too hot, it says pull over. If you need an oil change, it says check your oil. What's the equivalent for the body?" Cook said at a May conference in Amsterdam. "Health is a huge issue around the world and we think it's ripe for simplicity and a new view." An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. Earlier this year, Apple bought Gliimpse Inc., a startup that built software to pull electronic health records from different databases and in different formats, then store them in one place. "I will be working on building a platform, a set of application program interfaces, and a simple product that will bring what we believe will be a disruptive consumer health-care application to the U.S. for the first time," Apple Health senior engineer Mohan Randhava wrote on his LinkedIn profile, which states he was employed at Gliimpse until February. He likened the product to Apple's music business. That started with the iPod, but as people became accustomed to storing all their music files digitally, Apple built a lucrative music platform on top of the device. Apple health software could become a revenue driver, too, by keeping people wedded to the company's devices. If a patient's health records, and related suggestions, are accessible through Apple's system, it would be harder to trade in an iPhone for a smartphone running Google's Android operating system, and its health-tracking software Google Fit. The second version of Apple's Watch has a faster processor, a built-in GPS tracker and is water resistant so people can run, swim and do other exercise with the device. The updated Watch software, dubbed watchOS 3, places health tracking information more prominently in the user interface, and adds a breathing exercise app as well as swim tracking. Building more sensors into the Watch serves a limited purpose. An accelerometer can generate most of the useful data needed to monitor a person's well-being, according to one person with knowledge of Apple's plans. A glucometer or blood-pressure sensor would only help a small percentage of users, the person said. Adding new medical sensors would also likely require approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, a much higher bar for Apple to cross. "If they are going to an FDA device, it would need to have enough battery life to last a day, and something where it independently functions from your phone," said Yuri Teshler, a health-care consultant at Moor Insights & Strategy. Apple can't really do anything more with health-related sensors until the watch has a wireless LTE chip and the independent cellular connection that comes with that, he added. Apple has so far struggled to do that. It's unclear how soon improvements to Apple's HealthKit may be introduced. ResearchKit, another Apple software, lets research institutions and drugmakers conduct clinical trials using iPhone apps, and some of the trials hint at possible future applications for HealthKit. Each clinical study using ResearchKit brings Apple a step closer to embedding itself in hospitals, labs and doctors' surgeries. North Carolina's Duke University developed a ResearchKit app using the iPhone's front-facing camera to conduct facial recognition checks which try to screen for and diagnose autism. Johns Hopkins University is using the Apple Watch's accelerometer and heart-rate sensor to track the onset and duration of seizures and try to predict them. In July, GlaxoSmithKline PLC became the first drugmaker to start a ResearchKit clinical study. "Apple is working hard with many of these large institutions to generate tools that are medically correct, to take data from sensors," said Scott Jenkins, CEO of health data management company Certainty Health LLC. "They want to be the repository, the open collection space." Stephen Friend, a Merck & Co. veteran who founded health data nonprofit Sage Bionetworks, is credited with being the brains behind ResearchKit. He joined Apple full-time in June having worked as a consultant for more than two years. Flipboard co-founder Evan Doll rejoined Apple in July as a director of health software engineering. Yoky Matsuoka, formerly technology chief at Google's Nest Labs unit, also joined Apple's health team last year. Nest is known mostly as a hardware specialist, but Matsuoka led the development of software that interpreted and learned from data that its internet-connected thermostats collect. She's using that machine-learning experience as she oversees a health-data team at Apple. Apple's greatest hurdle for now is proving to medical professionals that data delivered from wearables through HealthKit and ResearchKit is reliable. Brennan Spiegel, a gastroenterologist at Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai Hospital, said clinical studies are crucial to making wearables useful. "It's wonderful to have advanced methods of aggregating and presenting data, but there's a risk of it becoming a garbage-in, garbage-out project," Spiegel said. "It doesn't matter how sophisticated the technical solution is. What matters is whether the data going into that solution are generating clinically valuable, actionable results that's improving human health in a way that's cost-effective." -- With assistance from Mark Gurman and Marie Mawad Article Comments (0) Tweet This article filed under: Business Technology Health & Fitness Bloomberg Comments () Guidelines: Keep it civil and on topic; no profanity, vulgarity, slurs or personal attacks.

Schenk, Prothena Corp. Co-Founder and CEO, Dies at 59 Michelle Cortez FayCortez Stephen Miller obitsman September 30, 2016 — 7:04 PM EDT Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp He was a pioneer in Alzheimer’s disease drug development Multiple drug companies are pursuing his line of research Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Dale Schenk, the co-founder and chief executive officer at Prothena Corp. who devoted his scientific career to researching neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, has died. He was 59. He died Sept. 30 at his home in Hillsborough, California, Ellen Rose, a spokeswoman for Prothena, said in a telephone interview. The cause was pancreatic cancer, according to a statement from the Dublin-based biotechnology company. He was diagnosed with the disease in December 2014 and announced on Sept. 26 that he was taking a medical leave of absence. Schenk gained prominence in the early 2000s for his work at Elan Corp., where he helped devise a vaccine to target beta amyloid, the protein that builds up in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease. The program was one of the first to directly attack beta amyloid, and early indications suggested the approach might impede the progress of the disease. It was also one of the first in a long line of later therapies to build hope for treating the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, only to fail in later testing. Then, as now, there were no medicines approved to target the underlying cause of the condition. The drugs that exist merely slow the progression of symptoms that accompany Alzheimer’s disease. Dashed Hopes The Elan vaccine removed buildup of the amyloid protein in the brains of mice bred to develop Alzheimer’s disease, and they never showed symptoms of it. In humans, however, the injection caused an inflammation of brain tissue, which led Elan to drop its development in 2002. Subsequent autopsies of patients who were treated with the vaccine and later died of unrelated causes showed they had less amyloid buildup in their brains, reviving hope that targeting the plaque could offer an avenue to treat the disease. Throughout his career, Schenk defended the so-called amyloid hypothesis as the cause of Alzheimer’s disease, his area of expertise since he began working on it in the 1980s. The amyloid vaccine wasn’t his only setback. He also championed one of the most well-known experimental medicines in the Alzheimer’s area, bapineuzumab, though Elan ultimately sold the development rights to Johnson & Johnson. Inspires Researchers Bapineuzumab, too, ultimately reduced the buildup of amyloid in patients’ brains without slowing the onslaught of the disease. Schenk’s research inspired others to explore the same pathways, and numerous experimental drugs from companies including Eli Lilly & Co., Roche Holding AG and Merck & Co. remain in development. Schenk climbed the ranks at Elan, rising to chief scientific officer and executive vice president after landing at the company through its acquisition of Athena Neurosciences in 1996. He left to help co-found and lead Prothena in 2012, after the development of bapineuzumab was halted after a second failed trial. Prothena grew to have a market valuation of $2.06 billion. The company’s top development projects include treatments for two protein buildup disorders, AL amyloidosis and TTR amyloidosis, as well as the neurological disorder Parkinson’s disease. Dale Bernard Schenk was born May 10, 1957, and grew up in Glendora, California. His parents were Walter Bernard Schenk, a firefighter, and Rosemary Schenk, a family therapist. As a child he played chess and the piano, but later decided to pursue scientific research because "piano is a hard row to hoe," he said in a 2001 interview with CNN.com. Early Career He received a bachelor’s degree in biology from the University of California at San Diego in 1979, according to his LinkedIn.com profile. In 1984, he earned a Ph.D. in physiology and pharmacology from the school. After gaining his doctorate, Schenk became a staff scientist at Scios Inc. of Mountain View, California. In 1987, he joined Athena Neurosciences Inc., in San Francisco, where he was director of neurobiology. He stayed on when the company was acquired by Elan in 1996, and was named chief scientific officer in 2008. He became head of Elan’s Neotope Biosciences division in 2009. In 2001, he won the American Academy of Neurology’s Potamkin Prize for research in Alzheimer’s disease. Schenk is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, and their children Max and Sam, and two children, Anais and Sara, from a previous marriage to Maria Torres, who died in 2005.

Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk announced Thursday that it is cutting 1,000 jobs (about half of them in Denmark), after last month slashing growth forecasts for 2016, citing lower U.S. prices for diabetes drugs. These will likely not be the last victims, either—Novo and competitors such as Sanofi and Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly will likely have to keep tightening their belts as prices and profit margins fall. Diabetes is fertile ground for a drug-price fight. It's a $40 billion-plus market in the United States, with many big firms looking to protect billion-dollar franchises. Each of the many medicines treating diabetes has multiple strong competitors. And all the customers want to pay less. Diabetes is a chronic illness affecting millions of people—a recipe for a lot of drug spending. Naturally, those who pay the drug bills—insurers, pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, and the U.S. government—have an interest in keeping prices under control. And those payers have extra leverage against the pharma companies because of the sheer number of drugs on the market. In August, pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts said it would decline next year to pay for several Novo Nordisk drugs—which accounted for more than $7 billion in sales last year—in favor of medicines from Eli Lilly and others. Novo Nordisk's competitors probably offered substantial discounts to get on the PBM's favored-drug list. CVS Health, meanwhile, said it will exclude Sanofi's long-acting insulin drugs Lantus and Toujeo (expected to combine for $6.8 billion in sales this year) next year in favor of Eli Lilly's similar drug, Basaglar, which rolls out in mid-December. UnitedHealth, a large health insurer that also has a large PBM segment, revealed it was doing the same. As new drugs and drug combinations hit the market and PBMs aggressively curate their favored drug lists, drugmakers are forced to continually raise the rebates, or discounts, they make to payers to stay competitive. For example, the implied rebate—the percentage of gross drug sales given away in rebates and other discounts—Sanofi gives for its drug Lantus has grown from around 10 percent in 2009 to nearly 60 percent last quarter, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. The discounting could get even more severe when Eli Lilly's rival drug Basaglar hits the U.S. market. This is happening to many diabetes drugs. Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk's short-acting insulins have implied rebates of about 70 percent, according to BI. Newer diabetes drugs in different classes, such as Eli Lilly's Trulicity, Merck's Januvia, and Novo's Victoza, also have large and rising rebates. Such price competition does not tend to suddenly reverse. It's actually more likely to increase—agreements between payers and drugmakers get renegotiated every year, and PBMs have gotten more savvy and aggressive about playing companies against each other to get the biggest possible discounts, especially in large drug classes. For an example of the kind of impact this has on revenue, consider Sanofi's Lantus, the biggest-selling diabetes drug. Since 2014, Wall Street's consensus forecast for the drug's 2017 sales has fallen from $7.1 billion to $5.1 billion. Lantus is expected to fall below $4 billion in sales by 2019.   Those 1,000 job cuts will likely not be the last.

The report titled, "Global Diabetes Care Devices Market - Growth, Trends and Forecast," discusses the current landscape and outlook of the said market. The global diabetic care devices market is estimated to be USD 22.3 billion in 2016 and is expected to reach USD 30.4 billion by 2021, while projecting a CAGR of 5.93%. The report is an amalgamation of the current market scenario, its future prospects, and forces driving the market as well as those that are restraining the growth of the market along with the key market players. It highlights the market geographically in North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Middle East and Africa. Globally, diabetes continues to be the fourth leading cause of death by a disease. According to the International Diabetes Federation, seven million people are added every year to the pool of 246 million diabetics. Around 3.8 million people die each year from diabetes and even more people die of other chronic diseases as a result of diabetes. Browse Related Report Here The global diabetes patient pool is expected to reach 380 million by 2025 because of increasing aging population, sedentary lifestyle, and unhealthy dietary patterns. The report details several driving and restraining factors for the global diabetes care devices market. The invention of new and innovative technologies as a result of increased research and development expenses for diabetes diagnosis and treatment, development of non-invasive products for treatment, increasing awareness, and improving diagnosis and treatment rates are a few of the reasons that will help in market growth. The market is constrained by high cost associated with diagnosis and treatment, reimbursement issues and patent expiry. Our report on the diabetes care devices market has been segmented as follows: Diabetes Care Devices                        Glucose Monitoring Devices         Blood Glucose Meters Blood Glucose Test Strips Lancing Devices Continuous Glucose Monitoring Devices Insulin Delivery Devices  Insulin Pumps Insulin Syringes Insulin Pens Therapy Type                          Injectable             Oral Drugs             Geography                               North America    Europe   Asia-Pacific            Rest of the World      Asia-Pacific, especially China possesses impressive growth potential for the diabetic care devices market in the years to come. This can be explained with the presence of an extensive customer base in this region because of continuous economic growth, high population suffering from diabetes, drastic change in the lifestyle, and lack of awareness in people for diagnosis and treatment.

Credit Rodrigo del Río Lozano The disease is characterized by an itching, oozing rash that can cover almost all of the skin. The constant itch, to say nothing of the disfigurement, can be so unbearable that many patients consider suicide. There has never been a safe and effective treatment. On Saturday, the results of two large clinical trials of a new drug offered hope to the estimated 1.6 million adult Americans with an uncontrolled, moderate-to-severe form of the disease, atopic dermatitis, which is a type of eczema. Most patients who got the active drug, dupilumab, instead of a placebo reported that the itching began to wane within two weeks and was gone in a few months, as their skin began to clear. Nearly 40 percent of participants getting the drug saw all or almost all of their rash disappear. For some, relief was almost instantaneous. “I knew immediately I was on the drug” and not the placebo, said Daniela Velasco, an event planner in Playa del Carmen, Mexico. Within a couple of weeks, the ugly red rash that had covered 90 percent of her body was almost gone. Even better, she said, “for the first time I didn’t feel any itch at all.” Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story Before entering the trial, Mrs. Velasco, 36, had seen 40 doctors about the disease and tried dozens of drugs and treatments, to no avail. To participate in the study, she spent more than $95,000 to fly to Mount Sinai in New York on a regular basis and stay in hotels. She realized she might get a placebo but also knew that when the study ended everyone, including the placebo patients, would be able get the drug if the trial was successful. The drug blocks two specific molecules of the immune system that are overproduced in patients with this and some other allergic diseases. The only side effects were a slight increase in conjunctivitis, an inflammation of the outer membrane of the eye, and swelling at the injection site. “This is a landmark study,” said Dr. Mark Boguniewicz, an atopic dermatitis expert at National Jewish Health and the University of Colorado School of Medicine who was not involved with the study. “For us in atopic dermatitis, we are entering a new era.” Photo Daniela Velasco’s arms, left and top, and legs, below right, before the treatment with dupilumab. Credit Emma Guttman-Yassky The studies, lasting 16 weeks and involving nearly 1,400 people, were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Dr. George D. Yancopoulos, the president and chief scientific officer at Regeneron, which, in partnership with Sanofi, makes the drug, said he expects the Food and Drug Administration to rule on dupilumab by March 29, 2017. The drug’s brand name will be Dupixent. The agency has given the drug breakthrough status, which provides expedited development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening diseases.

Atopic dermatitis experts said they have longed for a safe and highly effective treatment. In desperation, some prescribed other drugs off-label, like powerful immunosuppressants or high doses of steroids, which are far from ideal because even if they helped, their side effects can be severe — kidney failure with immunosuppressants, bone loss and even psychotic breaks with high-dose steroids. Patients are miserable, Dr. Boguniewicz said. “Our patients and families haven’t slept through the night, not for days or weeks, but for months or years.” Many doctors provide no treatments other than perhaps creams and ointments that do not stop the itching or soothe the red and weeping rash, said Dr. Jonathan I. Silverberg of Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine and a principal investigator in one of the studies. Many sufferers can relate to the plight of the defense lawyer played by John Turturro in the HBO series “The Night Of.” He suffers from atopic dermatitis that started on his legs and his feet and later spread to his neck and head. Like so many patients, he tries treatment after treatment — bleach baths, covering the rash in Crisco and wrapping it with plastic wrap, steroids, Chinese medicine. He scratches it with chopsticks and disgusts people near him. But all to no avail. Such experiences explain the excitement over the new drug, although researchers say they would like to see longer-term data. “What we are seeing are some really impressive efficacy numbers,” Dr. Silverberg said. “But efficacy alone is not enough. It is the safety profile that is the real key. Everything we are seeing really looks great.” Photo Herb Bull at a friend’s home in Westfield, N.J. He said the new drug “saved his life.” Credit Bryan Anselm for The New York Times Dr. Jon M. Hanifin, a professor of dermatology at Oregon Health and Science University and founder of the National Eczema Association, agreed. While not a principal investigator in the study, Dr. Hanifin did oversee the care of some patients enrolled in it.

Their life was destroyed.” Dr. Yancopoulos was inspired in part to develop the drug because his father had severe atopic dermatitis, which he developed shortly after he got lung cancer at 70. “More so than the cancer and the chemo, this rash and its horrible itch started dominating his life and ruining its quality,” Dr. Yancopoulos said. “Here’s a guy with Stage IIIB lung cancer — basically a death sentence — and he is more concerned and miserable about his skin and his itch.” One participant in the trial, Lisa Tannebaum, a 53-year-old harpist in Stamford, Conn., was so thrilled that she wrote a letter to Regeneron suggesting they use her before and after photographs in advertisements. She developed a severe form of the disease 14 years ago and tried everything imaginable in conventional and alternative medicine without relief — specialized diets, immunosuppressive drugs, special clothing, bleach baths. She even had the gold fillings removed from her teeth on the theory that they may be causing an allergic response, but to no avail. “It was like every day I had poison ivy and fire ants on myself,” she said. “You don’t sleep at all. You can’t go out, you have staph infections all the time,” because the skin’s protective barrier is broken by the rash. “I couldn’t drive my kids to school because the itching was so bad I couldn’t put my hands on the steering wheel.” Now, she is performing again and will be playing her harp at Carnegie Hall on Oct. 30. Herb Bull, 71, a retired Merck scientist in Westfield, N.J., had mild atopic dermatitis for years until three years ago, when it took a turn for the worse. The rash covered his entire body. Sleep was impossible, itching a constant torment. Even walking was difficult. “He had weeping lesions all over his body,” said his doctor, Dr. Emma Guttman-Yassky, a principal investigator in the trial and professor of dermatology and immunology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. “I thought I might as well give up and die,” Mr. Bull said. It took months for the drug to work, he said, but when it did, the change was miraculous. His rash and the itching went away. The new drug, Mr. Bull said, “saved my life.” A version of this article appears in print on October 1, 2016, on page A13 of the New York edition with the headline: 2 Trials Show New Treatment for Severe Eczema Can Provide Swift Relief.
