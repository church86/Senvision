The approval allows marketing of KEYTRUDA in all 28 EU member states plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, at the approved dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. “Today’s approval brings an important new treatment option to patients in Europe with classical Hodgkin lymphoma who have not responded to existing therapies,” said Dr. Roger Dansey, senior vice president and therapeutic area head, oncology late-stage development, Merck Research Laboratories. “This milestone underscores our commitment to evaluating KEYTRUDA in diseases with unmet need facing the hematology community.” “For patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma who have not been successfully treated with prior therapies – many of whom are young and have a poor prognosis – there are limited options and treating the disease poses significant challenges,” said Pier Luigi Zinzani, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor of hematology, Institute of Hematology “L. e A. Seràgnoli,” University of Bologna. “With this approval, we will now be able to provide these patients with a much-needed new treatment option.” Data Supporting the Approval The approval was based on data in 241 patients from the KEYNOTE-087 and KEYNOTE-013 trials. These multicenter, open-label studies evaluated patients with cHL who failed ASCT and BV, who were ineligible for ASCT because they were unable to achieve a complete or partial remission after salvage chemotherapy and failed BV, or who failed ASCT and did not receive BV. Both studies included patients regardless of PD-L1 expression. Patients with active, non-infectious pneumonitis, an allogeneic transplant within the past five years (or more than five years but with graft-versus-host-disease [GVHD]), active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible for either trial. The major efficacy outcome measures, overall response rate (ORR) and complete remission rate (CRR), were assessed by blinded independent central review according to the 2007 revised International Working Group (IWG) criteria. Secondary efficacy outcome measures were duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival. In KEYNOTE-087, 210 patients received KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) at a dose of 200 mg every three weeks until unacceptable toxicity or documented disease progression. Eighty-one percent of patients were refractory to at least one prior therapy, including 35 percent who were refractory to first-line therapy. Additionally, 61 percent of patients had undergone prior ASCT, 38 percent were transplant ineligible; 17 percent had no prior BV use and 36 percent of patients had prior radiation therapy. Efficacy analysis showed an ORR of 69 percent (95% CI: 62.3, 75.2) with a CRR of 22 percent and a partial remission rate (PRR) of 47 percent. The median follow-up time was 10.1 months. Among the 145 responding patients, the median duration of response was 11.1 months (range 0.0+ to 11.1), with 76 percent of responding patients having responses of six months or longer. In KEYNOTE-013, 31 patients received KEYTRUDA at a dose of 10 mg/kg every two weeks until unacceptable toxicity or documented disease progression. Eighty-seven percent of patients were refractory to at least one prior therapy, including 39 percent who were refractory to first-line therapy. Seventy-four percent of patients had undergone prior ASCT, 26 percent were transplant ineligible, and 42 percent of patients had prior radiation therapy. Efficacy analysis showed an ORR of 58 percent (95% CI: 39.1, 75.5) with a CRR of 19 percent and a PRR of 39 percent. The median follow-up time was 28.7 months. Among the 18 responding patients, the median duration of response was not reached (range 0.0+ to 26.1+), with 80 percent of patients with a response of six months or longer and 70 percent of patients with a response of 12 months or longer. The safety analysis supporting the European approval of KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) was based on 3,194 patients with advanced melanoma, NSCLC or cHL across four doses (2 mg/kg every three weeks, 200 mg every three weeks, or 10 mg/kg every two or three weeks) in clinical studies. The most common adverse reactions (greater than 10%) with KEYTRUDA were fatigue (22%), pruritus (15%), rash (13%), diarrhea (12%) and nausea (10%). The majority of adverse reactions reported were of Grade 1 or 2 severity. The most serious adverse reactions were immune-related adverse reactions and severe infusion-related reactions. About Hodgkin Lymphoma Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of lymphoma that develops in the white blood cells, called lymphocytes, which are part of the immune system. Hodgkin lymphoma can start almost anywhere – most often in lymph nodes in the upper part of the body, with the most common sites being in the chest, neck or under the arms. Worldwide, there were approximately 66,000 new cases of Hodgkin lymphoma and 25,500 people died from the disease in 2012. Classical Hodgkin lymphoma accounts for about 95 percent of all cases of Hodgkin lymphoma in developed countries. About KEYTRUDA ®(pembrolizumab) KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. KEYTRUDA is administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every three weeks for the approved indications. KEYTRUDA for injection is supplied in a 100 mg single-dose vial. KEYTRUDA Indications and Dosing in the U.S. Melanoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma at a dose of 2 mg/kg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Lung Cancer KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥50%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. KEYTRUDA is also indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA. In metastatic NSCLC, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Head and Neck Cancer KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In HNSCC, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), or who have relapsed after three or more prior lines of therapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In adults with cHL, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. In pediatric patients with cHL, KEYTRUDA is administered at a dose of 2 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 200 mg) every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA ®  (pembrolizumab) KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 94 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%) pneumonitis, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (6.9%) compared to those without (2.9%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 48 (1.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) colitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 19 (0.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%) hepatitis. Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis. Hypophysitis occurred in 17 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%) hypophysitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency). Administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. KEYTRUDA can cause thyroid disorders, including hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and thyroiditis. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 96 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%) hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism occurred in 237 (8.5%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%) hypothyroidism. Thyroiditis occurred in 16 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%) thyroiditis. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. Administer replacement hormones for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) can cause type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 9 (0.3%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis. KEYTRUDA can cause other clinically important immune-mediated adverse reactions. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction. The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), exfoliative dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid, rash (1.4%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, and partial seizures arising in a patient with inflammatory foci in brain parenchyma. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including cHL, and postmarketing use. Solid organ transplant rejection has been reported in postmarketing use of KEYTRUDA. Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment with KEYTRUDA vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients. KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions, including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab). Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after being treated with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA on any trial, 6 patients (26%) developed graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), one of which was fatal, and 2 patients (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning, one of which was fatal. Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor-blocking antibody before transplantation. These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute GVHD, severe (Grade 3 to 4) acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic VOD, and other immune-mediated adverse reactions, and intervene promptly. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 5% of 210 patients with cHL and treatment was interrupted due to adverse reactions in 26% of patients. Fifteen percent (15%) of patients had an adverse reaction requiring systemic corticosteroid therapy. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 16% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (>1%) included pneumonia, pneumonitis, pyrexia, dyspnea, GVHD, and herpes zoster. Two patients died from causes other than disease progression; one from GVHD after subsequent allogeneic HSCT and one from septic shock. The most common adverse reactions (occurring in ≥20% of patients) were fatigue (26%), pyrexia (24%), cough (24%), musculoskeletal pain (21%), diarrhea (20%), and rash (20%). It is not known whether KEYTRUDA is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, instruct women to discontinue nursing during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the final dose. There is limited experience in pediatric patients. In a study of 40 pediatric patients with advanced melanoma, PD-L1–positive advanced, relapsed, or refractory solid tumors or lymphoma, patients were treated with KEYTRUDA for a median of 43 days (range 1 to 414 days), with 24 patients (60%) receiving treatment for 42 days or more. The safety profile in pediatric patients was similar to that seen in adults treated with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab). Toxicities that occurred at a higher rate (≥15% difference) in these patients when compared to adults under 65 years of age were fatigue (45%), vomiting (38%), abdominal pain (28%), hypertransaminasemia (28%), and hyponatremia (18%).

These multicenter, open-label studies evaluated patients with cHL who failed ASCT and BV, who were ineligible for ASCT because they were unable to achieve a complete or partial remission after salvage chemotherapy and failed BV, or who failed ASCT and did not receive BV. Both studies included patients regardless of PD-L1 expression. Patients with active, non-infectious pneumonitis, an allogeneic transplant within the past five years (or more than five years but with graft-versus-host-disease [GVHD]), active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible for either trial. The major efficacy outcome measures, overall response rate (ORR) and complete remission rate (CRR), were assessed by blinded independent central review according to the 2007 revised International Working Group (IWG) criteria.

Additionally, 61 percent of patients had undergone prior ASCT, 38 percent were transplant ineligible; 17 percent had no prior BV use and 36 percent of patients had prior radiation therapy. Efficacy analysis showed an ORR of 69 percent (95% CI: 62.3, 75.2) with a CRR of 22 percent and a partial remission rate (PRR) of 47 percent. The median follow-up time was 10.1 months. Among the 145 responding patients, the median duration of response was 11.1 months (range 0.0+ to 11.1), with 76 percent of responding patients having responses of six months or longer. In KEYNOTE-013, 31 patients received KEYTRUDA at a dose of 10 mg/kg every two weeks until unacceptable toxicity or documented disease progression. Eighty-seven percent of patients were refractory to at least one prior therapy, including 39 percent who were refractory to first-line therapy. Seventy-four percent of patients had undergone prior ASCT, 26 percent were transplant ineligible, and 42 percent of patients had prior radiation therapy. Efficacy analysis showed an ORR of 58 percent (95% CI: 39.1, 75.5) with a CRR of 19 percent and a PRR of 39 percent. The median follow-up time was 28.7 months. Among the 18 responding patients, the median duration of response was not reached (range 0.0+ to 26.1+), with 80 percent of patients with a response of six months or longer and 70 percent of patients with a response of 12 months or longer. The safety analysis supporting the European approval of KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) was based on 3,194 patients with advanced melanoma, NSCLC or cHL across four doses (2 mg/kg every three weeks, 200 mg every three weeks, or 10 mg/kg every two or three weeks) in clinical studies. The most common adverse reactions (greater than 10%) with KEYTRUDA were fatigue (22%), pruritus (15%), rash (13%), diarrhea (12%) and nausea (10%). The majority of adverse reactions reported were of Grade 1 or 2 severity. The most serious adverse reactions were immune-related adverse reactions and severe infusion-related reactions.

About KEYTRUDA®(pembrolizumab) KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. KEYTRUDA is administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every three weeks for the approved indications. KEYTRUDA for injection is supplied in a 100 mg single-dose vial. KEYTRUDA Indications and Dosing in the U.S. Melanoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma at a dose of 2 mg/kg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Lung Cancer KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥50%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. KEYTRUDA is also indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA. In metastatic NSCLC, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Head and Neck Cancer KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In HNSCC, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), or who have relapsed after three or more prior lines of therapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In adults with cHL, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. In pediatric patients with cHL, KEYTRUDA is administered at a dose of 2 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 200 mg) every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 94 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%) pneumonitis, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (6.9%) compared to those without (2.9%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 48 (1.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) colitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 19 (0.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%) hepatitis. Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis. Hypophysitis occurred in 17 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%) hypophysitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency). Administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. KEYTRUDA can cause thyroid disorders, including hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and thyroiditis. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 96 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%) hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism occurred in 237 (8.5%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%) hypothyroidism. Thyroiditis occurred in 16 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%) thyroiditis. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. Administer replacement hormones for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) can cause type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 9 (0.3%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis. KEYTRUDA can cause other clinically important immune-mediated adverse reactions. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction. The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), exfoliative dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid, rash (1.4%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, and partial seizures arising in a patient with inflammatory foci in brain parenchyma. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including cHL, and postmarketing use. Solid organ transplant rejection has been reported in postmarketing use of KEYTRUDA. Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment with KEYTRUDA vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients. KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions, including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab). Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after being treated with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA on any trial, 6 patients (26%) developed graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), one of which was fatal, and 2 patients (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning, one of which was fatal. Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor-blocking antibody before transplantation. These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute GVHD, severe (Grade 3 to 4) acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic VOD, and other immune-mediated adverse reactions, and intervene promptly. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 5% of 210 patients with cHL and treatment was interrupted due to adverse reactions in 26% of patients. Fifteen percent (15%) of patients had an adverse reaction requiring systemic corticosteroid therapy. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 16% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (>1%) included pneumonia, pneumonitis, pyrexia, dyspnea, GVHD, and herpes zoster. Two patients died from causes other than disease progression; one from GVHD after subsequent allogeneic HSCT and one from septic shock. The most common adverse reactions (occurring in ≥20% of patients) were fatigue (26%), pyrexia (24%), cough (24%), musculoskeletal pain (21%), diarrhea (20%), and rash (20%). It is not known whether KEYTRUDA is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, instruct women to discontinue nursing during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the final dose. There is limited experience in pediatric patients. In a study of 40 pediatric patients with advanced melanoma, PD-L1–positive advanced, relapsed, or refractory solid tumors or lymphoma, patients were treated with KEYTRUDA for a median of 43 days (range 1 to 414 days), with 24 patients (60%) receiving treatment for 42 days or more. The safety profile in pediatric patients was similar to that seen in adults treated with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab). Toxicities that occurred at a higher rate (≥15% difference) in these patients when compared to adults under 65 years of age were fatigue (45%), vomiting (38%), abdominal pain (28%), hypertransaminasemia (28%), and hyponatremia (18%).

The approval allows marketing of KEYTRUDA in all 28 EU member states plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, at the approved dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. “Today’s approval brings an important new treatment option to patients in Europe with classical Hodgkin lymphoma who have not responded to existing therapies,” said Dr. Roger Dansey, senior vice president and therapeutic area head, oncology late-stage development, Merck Research Laboratories. “This milestone underscores our commitment to evaluating KEYTRUDA in diseases with unmet need facing the hematology community.” “For patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma who have not been successfully treated with prior therapies – many of whom are young and have a poor prognosis – there are limited options and treating the disease poses significant challenges,” said Pier Luigi Zinzani, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor of hematology, Institute of Hematology “L. e A. Seràgnoli,” University of Bologna. “With this approval, we will now be able to provide these patients with a much-needed new treatment option.” Data Supporting the Approval The approval was based on data in 241 patients from the KEYNOTE-087 and KEYNOTE-013 trials. These multicenter, open-label studies evaluated patients with cHL who failed ASCT and BV, who were ineligible for ASCT because they were unable to achieve a complete or partial remission after salvage chemotherapy and failed BV, or who failed ASCT and did not receive BV. Both studies included patients regardless of PD-L1 expression. Patients with active, non-infectious pneumonitis, an allogeneic transplant within the past five years (or more than five years but with graft-versus-host-disease [GVHD]), active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible for either trial. The major efficacy outcome measures, overall response rate (ORR) and complete remission rate (CRR), were assessed by blinded independent central review according to the 2007 revised International Working Group (IWG) criteria. Secondary efficacy outcome measures were duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival. In KEYNOTE-087, 210 patients received KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) at a dose of 200 mg every three weeks until unacceptable toxicity or documented disease progression. Eighty-one percent of patients were refractory to at least one prior therapy, including 35 percent who were refractory to first-line therapy. Additionally, 61 percent of patients had undergone prior ASCT, 38 percent were transplant ineligible; 17 percent had no prior BV use and 36 percent of patients had prior radiation therapy. Efficacy analysis showed an ORR of 69 percent (95% ci:62.3)(95% ci:75.2) with a CRR of 22 percent and a partial remission rate (PRR) of 47 percent. The median follow-up time was 10.1 months. Among the 145 responding patients, the median duration of response was 11.1 months (range 0.0+ to 11.1), with 76 percent of responding patients having responses of six months or longer. In KEYNOTE-013, 31 patients received KEYTRUDA at a dose of 10 mg/kg every two weeks until unacceptable toxicity or documented disease progression. Eighty-seven percent of patients were refractory to at least one prior therapy, including 39 percent who were refractory to first-line therapy. Seventy-four percent of patients had undergone prior ASCT, 26 percent were transplant ineligible, and 42 percent of patients had prior radiation therapy. Efficacy analysis showed an ORR of 58 percent (95% ci:39.1)(95% ci:75.5) with a CRR of 19 percent and a PRR of 39 percent. The median follow-up time was 28.7 months. Among the 18 responding patients, the median duration of response was not reached (range 0.0+ to 26.1+), with 80 percent of patients with a response of six months or longer and 70 percent of patients with a response of 12 months or longer. The safety analysis supporting the European approval of KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) was based on 3,194 patients with advanced melanoma, NSCLC or cHL across four doses (2 mg/kg every three weeks, 200 mg every three weeks, or 10 mg/kg every two or three weeks) in clinical studies. The most common adverse reactions (greater than 10%) with KEYTRUDA were fatigue (22%), pruritus (15%), rash (13%), diarrhea (12%) and nausea (10%). The majority of adverse reactions reported were of Grade 1 or 2 severity. The most serious adverse reactions were immune-related adverse reactions and severe infusion-related reactions. About Hodgkin Lymphoma Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of lymphoma that develops in the white blood cells, called lymphocytes, which are part of the immune system. Hodgkin lymphoma can start almost anywhere – most often in lymph nodes in the upper part of the body, with the most common sites being in the chest, neck or under the arms. Worldwide, there were approximately 66,000 new cases of Hodgkin lymphoma and 25,500 people died from the disease in 2012. Classical Hodgkin lymphoma accounts for about 95 percent of all cases of Hodgkin lymphoma in developed countries. About KEYTRUDA [®] (pembrolizumab) KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells.

Solid organ transplant rejection has been reported in postmarketing use of KEYTRUDA. Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment with KEYTRUDA vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients. KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions, including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab). Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after being treated with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA on any trial, 6 patients (26%) developed graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), one of which was fatal, and 2 patients (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning, one of which was fatal. Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor-blocking antibody before transplantation. These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute GVHD, severe (Grade 3 to 4) acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic VOD, and other immune-mediated adverse reactions, and intervene promptly. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 5% of 210 patients with cHL and treatment was interrupted due to adverse reactions in 26% of patients. Fifteen percent (15%) of patients had an adverse reaction requiring systemic corticosteroid therapy. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 16% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (>1%) included pneumonia, pneumonitis, pyrexia, dyspnea, GVHD, and herpes zoster. Two patients died from causes other than disease progression; one from GVHD after subsequent allogeneic HSCT and one from septic shock. The most common adverse reactions (occurring in greater-than or equal to 20% of patients) were fatigue (26%), pyrexia (24%), cough (24%), musculoskeletal pain (21%), diarrhea (20%), and rash (20%). It is not known whether KEYTRUDA is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, instruct women to discontinue nursing during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the final dose. There is limited experience in pediatric patients. In a study of 40 pediatric patients with advanced melanoma, PD-L1–positive advanced, relapsed, or refractory solid tumors or lymphoma, patients were treated with KEYTRUDA for a median of 43 days (range 1 to 414 days), with 24 patients (60%) receiving treatment for 42 days or more. The safety profile in pediatric patients was similar to that seen in adults treated with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab). Toxicities that occurred at a higher rate (greater-than or equal to 15% difference) in these patients when compared to adults under 65 years of age were fatigue (45%), vomiting (38%), abdominal pain (28%), hypertransaminasemia (28%), and hyponatremia (18%).

PD-L1 is a protein involved in the suppression of the immune system, which can impact the body’s ability to fight cancer. The VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) Assay¹ is now available for countries accepting the CE mark to identify untreated and previously treated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) patients eligible for KEYTRUDA immunotherapy. Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced the launch of the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) Assay as an in vitro diagnostic2 test for KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), an anti-PD-1 therapy,  to identify untreated and previously treated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) patients eligible for the immunotherapy. KEYTRUDA is marketed by Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth N.J., US, known as MSD outside the US and Canada. The assay is available in countries accepting the CE mark.3 Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths, with an annual estimated 12.9 percent of all new cancer cases and nearly 1.6 million deaths worldwide. NSCLC accounts for approximately 85 percent of all lung cancer cases.4 During the past three decades, lung cancer has shown the least improvement in survival rates when compared with other cancers.5 The VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) Assay is the only fully automated PD-L1 assay for KEYTRUDA to launch on Roche’s BenchMark series of instruments. The launch should significantly increase patient access to PD-L1 testing given Roche’s extensive global diagnostic instrument base. “Roche first launched the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) Assay in September 2016 as a diagnostic test for previously treated metastatic NSCLC patients in countries accepting the CE mark. We are very pleased to expand its application to include patients being considered for KEYTRUDA immunotherapy as the first line of treatment,” said Ann Costello, Head of Roche Tissue Diagnostics. “The assay provides new insights into possible treatment options for this potentially deadly disease.” Roche will continue to pursue regulatory approval for the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) Assay in other cancer indications and in other geographies. For more information, go to PDL1ihc.com. 1This product is intended for in vitro diagnostic (IVD) use. 2The VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) Assay has demonstrated equivalence to the CE marked PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay, which has previously demonstrated clinical utility through data from KEYNOTE-024 and KEYNOTE-010. KEYNOTE-024 was a phase 3, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter trial of 305 patients with metastatic NSCLC who were treatment naïve and whose tumors had high PD-L1 expression based on a tumor PD-L1 expression ≥50% and without EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. Outcome data showed superior progression free survival and overall survival in first-line treatment of mNSCLC with PD-L1 expression ≥50%. KEYNOTE-010 was an open-label, randomized, active-controlled, multicenter, phase 2/3 trial of 1,033 patients with mNSCLC that had progressed following platinum-containing chemotherapy, and if appropriate, targeted therapy for EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. Superior overall survival vs docetaxel at PD-L1 expression ≥1% was observed. For a CE mark, Roche relied on a method comparison study carried out by AstraZeneca, which compares data from currently available PD-L1 assays, DAKO pharmDx 22C3 (used in the clinical studies of KEYTRUDA), DAKO pharmDx 28-8 (used in the clinical studies of OPDIVO), and SP263. 3Please consult your local representative for availability and restrictions. 4Ferlay J, Soerjomataram I, Ervik M, et al.

"Roche first launched the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) Assay in September 2016 as a diagnostic test for previously treated metastatic NSCLC patients in countries accepting the CE mark. We are very pleased to expand its application to include patients being considered for KEYTRUDA immunotherapy as the first line of treatment," said Ann Costello, Head of Roche Tissue Diagnostics. "The assay provides new insights into possible treatment options for this potentially deadly disease." Roche will continue to pursue regulatory approval for the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) Assay in other cancer indications and in other geographies. For more information, go to PDL1ihc.com. 1This product is intended for in vitro diagnostic (IVD) use. 2The VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) Assay has demonstrated equivalence to the CE marked PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay, which has previously demonstrated clinical utility through data from KEYNOTE-024 and KEYNOTE-010. KEYNOTE-024 was a phase 3, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter trial of 305 patients with metastatic NSCLC who were treatment naïve and whose tumors had high PD-L1 expression based on a tumor PD-L1 expression ≥50% and without EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. Outcome data showed superior progression free survival and overall survival in first-line treatment of mNSCLC with PD-L1 expression ≥50%. KEYNOTE-010 was an open-label, randomized, active-controlled, multicenter, phase 2/3 trial of 1,033 patients with mNSCLC that had progressed following platinum-containing chemotherapy, and if appropriate, targeted therapy for EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. Superior overall survival vs docetaxel at PD-L1 expression ≥1% was observed. For a CE mark, Roche relied on a method comparison study carried out by AstraZeneca, which compares data from currently available PD-L1 assays, DAKO pharmDx 22C3 (used in the clinical studies of KEYTRUDA), DAKO pharmDx 28-8 (used in the clinical studies of OPDIVO), and SP263. 3Please consult your local representative for availability and restrictions. 4Ferlay J, Soerjomataram I, Ervik M, et al.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Human Papillomavirus and Cytomegalovirus Therapeutics Market by Global Type & Application 2014 – 2020 The global market for HPV and CMV therapeutics features numerous healthcare industry giants such as Roche AG, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, AbbVie Inc., Fresenius Kabi USA, Perrigo Company plc, Actavis plc, Fougera Pharmaceuticals, and Merck & Co. According to Transparency Market Research, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Fougera Pharmaceuticals, and Perrigo Company plc held a dominant 89.2% share in the global HPV therapeutics market in 2013, while the leaders in the CMV therapeutics market were Roche AG, Clinigen Group plc, and Fresenius Kabi USA, who collectively accounted for 93% of the market. The key opportunity for manufacturers of HPV and CMV therapeutics is the development of biologics and drugs with a low risk of possible toxicity. HPV therapeutics, in particular, have benefited immensely from the growing awareness about the adverse effects of the HPV vaccine. On the other hand, the CMV therapeutics is set to witness a growing demand for CMV vaccines, leading to players operating in both markets having to establish research into both product lines. This could result in increased consolidation of the HPV and CMV therapeutics market in the coming years, as smaller players may not be able to afford developing both product lines. Obtain Report Details @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/hpv-cmv-therapeutics-m… Expanding Healthcare Sector in Emerging Economies to Drive Demand for HPV, CMV Therapeutics The prime driver for the global HPV and CMV therapeutics market is the increasing prevalence of both diseases in emerging regions such as Asia Pacific and Latin America. The ongoing cultural shift in these regions has contributed to an increase in the prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases and is thus a driver for the HPV therapeutics market. Thanks to the rapid ongoing development of the healthcare sector, developing regions present lucrative opportunities for manufacturers of both HPV and CMV therapeutics. This has led to many leading market players focusing on maximizing their performance in underdeveloped/developing economies. The increasing demand for replacements for HPV vaccines is another key driver for the global HPV therapeutics market. Digestive distress, fever, headaches, and skin irritations at the site of the injection are some of the side effects of the HPV vaccine. The growing awareness regarding the risk of the same has resulted in growing public demand for HPV therapeutics instead. Lack of Awareness in Key Markets Hurting HPV, CMV Therapeutics Market On the other hand, despite the advancements in the healthcare sector, the lack of awareness about the etiology and treatment of HPV and CMV is hampering the market in emerging regions, as the rate of diagnosis among patients is quite low. This is a key restraint for the HPV and CMV therapeutics market in the coming years and is likely to be ameliorated by sustained efforts from healthcare bodies as well as manufacturers of HPV and CMV therapeutics. Genital Warts to Remain Leading Application of HPV Therapeutics Of the various ways in which HPV manifests, genital warts are the leading demand driver for HPV therapeutics. The high number of HPV strains that can cause genital warts, particularly when the disease is contracted through sexual contact, is responsible for the dominant share of the genital warts segment in the HPV therapeutics market. By drug class, ganciclovir and valganciclovir dominate the demand from the CMV therapeutics market, while immunomodulators are the leading class of drugs prescribed for HPV. Geographically, North America is the leading market for HPV and CMV therapeutics, with the regional HPV therapeutics market’s revenue expected to reach US$597.3 mn and the CMV therapeutics market’s revenue expected to reach US$202.2 mn by the end of 2016. Despite the substantial growth prospects of the Asia Pacific and Latin America markets for HPV and CMV therapeutics, the growing sexually active population and the ease of obtaining diagnostics and therapeutics in North America are likely to keep the latter dominant in the coming years. The global markets for HPV and CMV therapeutics are expected to reach a valuation of US$2.3 bn and US$0.9 bn, respectively, by 2020.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Veterinary Vaccines Market Research Report: Advanced Technologies & Growth Opportunities in Global Industry by 2024 Albany, NY — (SBWIRE) — 05/05/2017 — Companies Mentioned in the Research Report: The key players in the global veterinary vaccines market include Bayer AG, Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Bimeda, Inc., Virbac, Eli Lilly and Company (Elanco Animal Health), Ceva Santé Animale, Sanofi S.A. (Merial Animal Health), Merck Animal Health, and Zoetis, Inc. Global Veterinary Vaccines Market: Overview Veterinary vaccines often prove themselves to be live-savers for animals against diseases that are generally fatal or leave them impaired or handicapped. Veterinary vaccines thus offer protection to animals similar to the way humans are vaccinated against potentially incurable diseases. The way veterinary vaccines work may be different than human vaccines however. It is often encouraged for pet owners to vaccinate their pets regularly as it is much cheaper than opting for the treatment of a sick animal. It also helps reduce the transmission of germs and bacteria within animals and thus ensures a healthier environment for all animals and pets in an area. In the case of livestock, vaccination promotes a healthier output and prevents the transmission of harmful microorganisms to humans upon consumption of meat of animal products. The common diseases for which pets and livestock are vaccinated include brucellosis, pinkeye, E. coli, and rotavirus. The report on the global veterinary vaccines market offers a descriptive analysis of the factors that have been – and will be – responsible for the progress rate of the market. These factors are dissected based on the various segments available in the market for study and player diversity. The report uses all current and recent data to effectively pinpoint the situation the global veterinary vaccines market is in currently and what it will look like in the near future. The analysis of the global veterinary vaccines market is performed using tried and tested industry standards such as Porter’s Five Forces analysis and the SWOT analysis. The report also provides a highly in-depth view of the competitive landscape of the global veterinary vaccines market and its predicted future tense. Global Veterinary Vaccines Market: Trends and Opportunities: The primary driver boosting the global veterinary vaccines market is the growing consumption of animal products across the world. With a large human population associated with the demand for dairy, meat, fish, and eggs, it is necessary for the animal husbandry industry to spruce up its vaccination policies and rates. In the case of pets, the amount of pet owners in the world has also gone up considerably over the past few years. Market research points to an even higher number of pet owners by 2024. At the same time, the expenditure made by each pet owner for the health and happiness of their pets has risen significantly, further pointing to a progressively inclined rate of veterinary vaccination. The problem of high restrictions still persists in the global veterinary vaccines market as players are often barred from commercial entry due to the high market standards, regulatory restriction, and the high cost of research and development efforts. Many governments have stepped in, providing incentives and awareness initiatives for the sake of getting a larger population of the domesticated animal kingdom to be protected from harm. Browse full report on Veterinary Vaccines Market – http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/veterinary-vaccines-market.html Global Veterinary Vaccines Market: Region-wise Outlook: The global veterinary vaccines market is expected to reach US$11.4 bn by 2024, after being projected at a CAGR of 6.9% from 2016 to 2024. Regionally speaking, a large chunk of this current growth rate is attributed to the high demand shown by North America and its growing populations of pet owners and livestock. The emerging economies from Asia Pacific, Latin America and the Middle East are simultaneously showing a very high growth rate in their consumption of veterinary vaccines owing to greater awareness and an increasing demand for animal products.

Their aim? To lure wealthy Chinese patients, who might otherwise venture overseas, to this province in the South China Sea known for its beach-front resorts. To do so they are making an unusual promise: The hub will bring in cutting-edge treatments for diseases like cancer that are available abroad, but don’t yet have regulatory approval in China. There’s plenty of demand. The travel site Ctrip.com estimates about half a million Chinese travelled abroad for medical services last year. Millions are dying from cancer and heart disease, but regulatory bottlenecks have slowed approvals for the newest international therapies. Chinese hospitals are overflowing, and affluent jet-setters prefer Japan for physical check-ups or the US for genetic screenings. In 2013, the provincial government of Hainan, often known as China’s Hawaii, earmarked more than 1,600 acres of fertile farm land along a river flowing to its eastern coast for a medical tourism hub. Since then fishing villages and rice paddies are slowly being replaced by palm-tree-flanked driveways. The zone’s first hospitals are opening their doors this summer, the effective beginning of this medical experiment. Local officials say businesses have already committed to spending 23 billion yuan ($3.3 billion) for 27 projects ranging from hospitals to plastic surgery clinics, with dozens more awaiting approval. The mission is partly to “retain domestic consumption,” the government body managing the Hainan Boao Lecheng International Medical Tourism Pilot Zone said in emailed comments. New Medicines Among the investors are Beijing-based Ciming Health Checkup Management Group and Guangzhou-based medical services firm Evergrande Health Industry Group Ltd., which is being advised by Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School. In an early example, the zone’s Chengmei International Health Center imported 24 vials of the Merck & Co. cancer drug Keytruda for six patients under the special access channel last October, the government says. The medicine is approved in the US and elsewhere, but remains unavailable in the mainland. The special permits by the Chinese regulator only allow for a small amount of the drug to be used in the tourism hub, and it can’t be distributed elsewhere. Merck in a statement said it’s conducting clinical trials on Keytruda in China and doesn’t sell the drug in the country. The China Food and Drug Administration and Chengmei didn’t respond to a request for comment. Ghost Towns By 2025, the hub’s managers want to draw more than one million tourists a year on health-related visits. Still, China has a patchy record of managing specialised economic zones. Centers like Shenzhen, the fishing-village-turned metropolis, have thrived. But others have had a quick boom and bust, like the Caofeidian industrial zone in the northeast, which ended up as a ghost town. The Hainan medical hub’s relatively remote location and the country’s shortage of qualified doctors make it harder to draw patients. Competition for medical resources is fierce, said Chen Bo, associate partner at consultancy McKinsey & Co. “Building health-care capabilities there will require attracting excellent talent to work and live in the pilot zone, and good doctors are already badly needed in China’s major cities,” said Chen. On a recent visit, the area still had the feel of an underdeveloped backwater, showing the challenges to transforming it into a flourishing tourist Centre. It is dotted with semi-finished hospitals that remain under construction, without medical equipment inside and prefabricated homes outside for construction workers. By the end of March, five facilities had begun operating on a trial basis, local officials say. Evergrande has said it plans to spend 5 billion yuan on its cancer hospital there. Brigham and Women’s hospital in an emailed statement said it is serving as a strategic adviser as Evergrande expands its health-care network in China, helping the development of clinical programs and other aspects like training. Working with international partners has shown that local staffing tends to be the most effective, and Boao Evergrande International Hospital clinicians will be providing all patient care at that facility, Brigham said. The hospital was slated to start operating in the first half of this year, according to a December statement on Evergrande’s website. In a later March release the company noted the start date would be in 2017. In late March, balloons and banners adorned the hospital’s front gate, even though a quick glance inside the bronze-coloured building from a back entrance showed dark rooms with bare concrete walls, unpacked crates and cement piles. An Evergrande representative said the decorations were for the opening of the Boao Asian Forum Healthcare Track and that a soft launch date will be released later. Off the main street, behind the hospital pilot zone, was a side road yet to be paved with plywood and empty barrels of asphalt scattered around. Li Peijuan, an analyst at Forward Industries Institute, a Chinese research firm, said the area can benefit from Hainan island’s environmental beauty, but the quality of service, the standard of medical technology as well as costs will ultimately be key to its success. Foreign medicines have in the past taken longer to reach the Asian country partly because the regulator has been understaffed and so struggled to shepherd surging numbers of drug applications through its complex review process. The China Food and Drug Administration is now in the midst of dramatic reforms to its approval system to reduce the so-called “drug lag” on the mainland. If that succeeds, Hainan will need to find other selling points. “It was very appealing a few years back when approval of innovative drugs was relatively slow, but if the pilot zone can’t build full-fledged medical teams and business models in the next two to three years, its attractiveness will be greatly weakened,” said McKinsey’s Chen.

Cheung Bereskin & Parr LLP Your LinkedIn Connections at Firm Intellectual property strategy is fundamental to the successful development and commercialization of a personalized therapeutic and its companion diagnostic. In personalized therapy, healthcare professionals often use genetically-guided diagnostic tests to identify which medical treatments will be the safest and most effective for each patient. As the pharmaceutical industry transitions from the age of one-size-fits-all drugs to the age of personalized therapeutics, companion diagnostics will become indispensable in disease treatment and prevention. According to the Personalized Medicine Coalition, new personalized therapeutic drugs approved by the FDA are on an upward trajectory. They have risen from about 5% of all new drugs in 2005 to over 25% in 2015 and 2016. The era of personalized therapeutics is highlighted by the success of Merck's Keytruda (pembrolizumab), a humanized antibody used in cancer immunotherapy which targets the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor. Keytruda was initially approved for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma as a second-line therapy. Dako, in partnership with Merck, developed "PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx." This is a companion diagnostic that detects the level of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) protein, a binding partner of PD-1. With the aid of this companion diagnostic, clinical trials were carried out to find and treat patients who are most likely to benefit from Keytruda, i.e. patients who have high expression level of PD-L1 proteins on their tumor tissues. This targeted strategy has realized its goals, by helping the drug obtain its approval. In October 2015, the FDA approved expanding the indication for Keytruda for the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients whose tumors express PD-L1 and who have failed treatment with other chemotherapeutic agents. In October 2016, Keytruda was approved as a first-line treatment for metastatic NSCLC in patients with high-levels of PD-L1. In the U.S., Keytruda is protected by U.S. Patents 8,354,509 and 8,900,587 which disclose the therapeutic PD-1 specific antibody and its pharmaceutical composition. While most companion diagnostics are used in conjunction with one particular therapeutic drug, others are more versatile. They can help select an effective treatment from a range of options, based on the results of the test and the patient's treatment history. A case in point is "cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2" developed by Roche, which is a companion diagnostic test for Tarceva (erlotinib) and Tagrisso (osimertinib), both of which are small molecule EGFR inhibitors used for NSCLC treatment. Tarceva is marketed in the U.S. by OSI Pharmaceuticals and Genentech (a subsidiary of Roche), whereas Tagrisso is marketed in the U.S. by AstraZeneca. The diagnostic uses a real-time PCR test. If the tested tumor tissue from a patient was determined to harbor exon 19 deletions�and L858R mutation in EGFR, then the patient is most likely to benefit from Tarceva as a first-line treatment. If the EGFR was determined to have the mutation T790M, then the patient is most likely to benefit from Tagrisso in second and subsequent lines of therapy. In the U.S., Tarceva is protected by U.S. Patents 5,747,498, 6,900,221, 7,087,613, and RE41065, which cover the molecule, its pharmaceutical use and methods of production. Tagrisso is protected by U.S. Patent 8,946,235, which discloses the molecule, its pharmaceutical composition, and method for treatment related to the molecule. The cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2 itself is protected by U.S. Patent 7,687,247 related to the reaction mixture and DNA amplification composition, and U.S. Patent 7,964,349 that claims for a method for determining pharmacological effectiveness of treatment by erlotinib. The 7,964,349 patent is licensed to Roche by the General Hospital Corp and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. This is an example of how academically-driven inventions protected by patents are valued by industry and play a role in the development and commercialization of personalized medicine. In another example, Venetoclax (Venclexta) is a small molecule oral treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) marketed by Abbvie and Genentech in the U.S. This drug was granted "Breakthrough Therapy Designation" and later received accelerated FDA approval for CLL patients who have been refractory to previous treatment and have chromosomal deletion at Locus Specific Identifier (LSI) TP53. Venetoclax is linked to U.S. Patents 8,546,399 and 9,174,982 which claim the small molecule and the method of cancer treatment with the small molecule. The companion diagnostic for Venetoclax is the "Vysis CLL FISH Probe Kit" manufactured by Abbott Molecular which detects the deletion of LSI TP53 in blood specimens from patients. In addition to its prescribed use for detecting LSI TP53 deletion as an aid in identifying those patients with CLL who might benefit with Venetoclax treatment, the kit could also detect deletion of LSI ATM and LSI D13S319, and gain of the D12Z3 sequence. These additional features provide the potential for expanded use in the future. The direct-label fluorescence probes in the kit are covered by U.S. Patents 6,607,877, 7,115,709 and RE40,494, which are exclusively licensed to Abbott Molecular by The Regents of the University of California. The methods utilized by the kit in detecting multiple hybridization signals simultaneously are covered by U.S. Patent 6,203,977. This patent is exclusively licensed to Abbott Molecular by Yale University. The rapid pace of personalized medicine development will gain momentum with advances in chemogenomics, high-throughput production of interactome data, and the coming of age of next-generation sequencing technologies. This trend is not lost on the FDA. The agency has recently provided draft guidance on the "Principles for Codevelopment of an In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Device with a Therapeutic Product". The diagnostic is regulated as a medical device. Competition in this space will intensify, so intellectual property protection strategies are key to support company commercialization, as well as opening up collaborative and licensing opportunities for academic institutions. In all, bringing safe and effective personalized medicine to the market serves the ultimate goal of matching the right drug with the right patient in need.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Atara Biotherapeutics Announces First Quarter 2017 Financial Results and Recent Highlights SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., May 04, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:ATRA) today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2017 and recent operational highlights. /EIN News/ — „We continued to make important progress advancing our robust pipeline of T-cell therapies in the first quarter,” said Isaac Ciechanover, Chief Executive Officer and President of Atara Biotherapeutics. “With the expected initiation of two Phase 3 trials this year and a conditional marketing authorization submission in the EU next year for our lead oncology product candidate, ATA129, we are on our way to becoming a commercial immunotherapy company.  The recent data reported at AAN with autologous ATA188 in progressive multiple sclerosis also highlights the potential to expand our platform beyond oncology to include autoimmune disease.” Recent Highlights and Anticipated Upcoming Milestones • Manufacture and testing of allogeneic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-Specific Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL), or ATA129, including assay refinement and discussions with FDA, are ongoing and continuing as planned. Manufacturing lots to further support comparability evaluations and the Phase 3 trials. • Plan to initiate two Phase 3 pivotal trials with ATA129 in EBV-Associated Post Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder (EBV-PTLD) in the second half of 2017. Phase 3 trials intended to support approval in two indications: rituximab-refractory EBV-PTLD after hematopoietic cell transplant or solid organ transplant. Planned Phase 3 sites include leading bone marrow and solid organ transplant centers in the US and Europe. • Announced collaboration with Merck to evaluate KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in combination with ATA129 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Phase 1/2 trial sponsored and conducted by Atara in patients with platinum resistant or recurrent NPC with pembrolizumab provided by Merck is planned to start in 2018. • Obtained European Medicines Agency Scientific Advice for ATA129 under PRIME designation and plan to submit in 2018 a conditional marketing authorization (CMA) in Europe for the treatment of EBV-PTLD after hematopoietic cell transplant. Plan to develop EU infrastructure to support CMA submission and potential commercialization in Europe. • Announced key management appointments as the Company expands operations and core capabilities, advances its pipeline and moves towards the potential commercialization of ATA129, including: Joe Newell, Executive Vice President and Chief Technical Operations Officer, and John Craighead, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. • Atara’s collaborating investigators announced positive interim results from an ongoing Phase 1 trial of autologous ATA188 in patients with progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) at the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting 2017. Encouraging clinical improvements were observed in three of six progressive MS patients with advanced disease, which were correlated with CTL reactivity against target EBV antigens (EBV reactivity). Ongoing autologous ATA188 Phase 1 trial estimated to complete enrollment in the third quarter of 2017. • Expect to pursue clinical development of both autologous and allogeneic ATA188 to further inform and potentially accelerate the Company’s development program in MS. Based on FDA discussions, a planned Phase 1 allogeneic ATA188 trial in MS is on track to initiate in the second half of 2017. First Quarter 2017 Financial Results • Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of March 31, 2017 totaled $230.6 million, which the Company believes will be sufficient to fund planned operations into the first quarter of 2019. • The Company reported net losses of $25.7 million, or $0.88 per share, for the first quarter of 2017, as compared to $16.6 million, or $0.58 per share, for the same period in 2016. Substantially all of the Company’s net losses resulted from research and development expenses related to clinical and preclinical programs and from general and administrative expenses associated with operations. • Research and development expenses were $17.5 million for the first quarter of 2017, as compared to $11.2 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in the first quarter of 2017 was due to costs associated with the Company’s continuing expansion of research and development activities, including the following: manufacturing and outside service costs related to the preparation for the two Phase 3 clinical trials of ATA129 in EBV-PTLD, ongoing costs for the Company’s expanded access protocol clinical trial for ATA129, which was initiated in mid-2016, higher payroll and related costs from increased headcount, and an increase in allocated facilities and information technology expenses.    Research and development expenses include $2.1 million and $2.2 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses in the first quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively. • General and administrative expenses were $8.6 million for first quarter of 2017, as compared to $5.8 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs driven by increased headcount to support the Company’s expanding operations and higher consulting, outside services and legal costs. General and administrative expenses include $3.2 million and $2.5 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses in the first quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively. About Atara’s “Off-the-Shelf” Allogeneic Immunotherapy Platform Atara’s immunotherapy platform provides healthy immune capability to a patient and arms the immune system to precisely target and combat disease. T-cells derived from healthy donors are manufactured in advance and stored as inventory so that a customized unit of T-cells can be chosen for each patient. The T-cells are ready to infuse in approximately 3 to 5 days. Once administered, the T-cells home to their target, expand in-vivo to eliminate diseased cells, and eventually recede. This versatile platform can be directed towards a broad array of disease causing targets and has demonstrated clinical proof of concept across both viral and non-viral targets in conditions ranging from liquid and solid tumors to autoimmune and infectious diseases. The Company has pursued prospective feedback from health authorities on both manufacturing and clinical trial design. Atara’s lead product candidate, ATA129, has the potential to be the first commercial allogeneic T-cell therapy for a viral target implicated in cancer. About Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc. Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company developing meaningful therapies for patients with severe and life-threatening diseases who have been underserved by scientific innovation, with an initial focus on allogeneic T-cell therapies for cancer, autoimmune, and infectious disease. Atara’s T-cell product candidates harness the power of the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells and cells infected with certain viruses. The Company’s initial clinical stage T-cell product candidates include Epstein-Barr virus targeted Cytotoxic T-cells (EBV-CTL), or ATA129, Cytomegalovirus targeted Cytotoxic T-cells (CMV-CTL), or ATA230, and Wilms Tumor 1 targeted Cytotoxic T-cells (WT1-CTL), or ATA520. These product candidates have demonstrated the potential to have therapeutic benefit in a number of clinical indications including hematologic malignancies, solid tumors, and refractory viral infections. The Company is also developing a next generation of T-cell product candidates utilizing a technology to selectively enhance a T-cell’s ability to target specific viral proteins implicated in a disease. The Company’s ATA188 product candidate leverages this technology. Initial clinical investigations employing this approach will focus on multiple sclerosis and other virally mediated cancers.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Global Human Insulin Market Revenue is Expected to Reach US$ 49,197.3 Million by 2020 According to a new market report published by Persistence Market Research „Global Market Study on Human Insulin: Asia Pacific to Witness fastest Growth by 2020,” the global human insulin market was valued at USD 24,332.6 million in 2014 and was expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.4% from 2014 to 2020, to reach an estimated value of USD 49,197.3 million in 2020. Globally, the human insulin market is witnessing significant growth due to increasing prevalence of diabetes and increasing awareness among people about diabetes care. In addition, technological advancements in insulin delivery devices and increasing prevalence of lifestyle related disorders such as obesity are also driving the growth of the market. However, uneven pricing and limited access to human insulin in emerging countries such as Brazil, India, and China are inhibiting the growth of the human insulin market. In addition, strict regulatory requirements for drug approval are also restraining the growth of the market. The global human insulin market was anticipated to grow from an estimated USD 24,332.6 million in 2014 to USD 49,197.3 million in 2020 at a CAGR of 12.4% during the forecast period. In North America, increasing prevalence of diabetes with growing age and availability of advanced human insulin infusion devices are driving the use of human insulin in the market. In addition, increasing prevalence of lifestyle associated disorders such as obesity is also boosting the growth of the human insulin market in this region. For instance, according to the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC), a U.S.-based national public health institute, over one-third children and adolescents were obese in 2012 in the U.S. In Europe, the human insulin market is driven by rising aging population and increasing prevalence of diabetes. In addition, in Germany the market is evolving due to rising prevalence of diabetes and increasing awareness among people about diabetes care. However, in Asia-Pacific the growth for human insulin is much higher than developed countries due to increasing prevalence of diabetes and increasing government initiatives for improving healthcare.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Dilated Cardiomyopathy Therapeutics Market Research Report by Geographical Analysis and Forecast Dilated Cardiomyopathy Therapeutics Market Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a significant cause of heart failure and a leading indication for heart transplant among children and adults across the globe. This condition is characterized by enlargement of ventricular chamber, thinning of heart walls and inability to sufficiently pump blood throughout the body. Dilated cardiomyopathy can develop at any age but is more common among people aged between 20 years to 60 years. Genetic inheritance is found to affect about 30% to 40% of the total DCM patients. Single gene mutations in either the structural proteins of the myocyte, such as dystrophin, metavinculin, and lamin, or of mitochondrial DNA are also a prominent cause of DCM. Other factors such as diabetes, thyroid disorder, alcoholism, viral infections of the heart and heart valve abnormalities can also lead to dilated cardiomyopathy. Moreover, according to the Pediatric Cardiomyopathy Registry, DCM occurs at a rate of 6 per million children. It is commonly diagnosed in younger children with an average age of diagnosis at 2 years. This 90 page report gives readers a comprehensive overview of the Dilated Cardiomyopathy Therapeutics Market. Unlock the hidden opportunities in this market: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/dilated-cardiomyopathy… The global dilated cardiomyopathy therapeutics market is studied from two perspectives i.e. by drug class and by geography. Till date, there is no FDA approved drug specifically for dilated cardiomyopathy treatment. Owing to the aforementioned fact, the drug classes used in treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy are essentially the same as that for treatment of congestive heart failure. Some of the widely prescribed drug classes in dilated cardiomyopathy treatment encompass aldosterone antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and beta blockers. Angiotensin II receptor blockers acquired the largest market share by revenue in 2013, followed by beta blockers. This is attributed to high demand for block buster drugs in dilated cardiomyopathy treatment especially in the developed regions such as North America and Europe. Aldosterone antagonists recorded high growth rate due to the identified positive impact of aldosterone antagonists when used in combination with either ARBs or ACE inhibitors in reducing the progression of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Approval for this indication would further accelerate the overall sales of aldosterone antagonists, which in turn would positively impact market growth. Rising incidences of congestive heart failure across the globe is a prominent growth driver for dilated cardiomyopathy therapeutics market as DCM is one of the leading causes of heart failure. Globally, dilated cardiomyopathy accounts for approximately 30% to 40% of the total congestive heart failure cases each year. Owing to the alarming rise in incidences of congestive heart failure, several companies have initiated clinical trial studies to develop therapeutics specifically for dilated cardiomyopathy. For instance, Array BioPharma in 2015 is conducting a phase II study for its drug candidate ARRY-371797 for DCM treatment. Additionally, Celladon Corporation in 2014 completed its phase II study of MYDICAR for dilated cardiomyopathy treatment. Success of these clinical studies will boost the growth and demand for dilated cardiomyopathy therapeutics market in forthcoming years. However, promising gene therapy and availability of implantable devices (implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), heart pumps and pacemakers) are major restraints to the DCM therapeutics market. Get accurate market forecast and analysis on the Dilated Cardiomyopathy Therapeutics Market. Request a sample to stay abreast on the key trends impacting this market: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Geographically, dilated cardiomyopathy therapeutics market is studied for four regions: North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and the Rest of the World. In terms of revenue, North America accounted for the largest market share in 2013 owing to rising incidences of congestive heart failure and high acceptance of branded drugs. In the U.S., DCM is prevalent in approximately five to eight people out of every 100,000 people. In Canada, heart failure affects over 1% of the total population and is responsible for about 9% of all the deaths. Asia Pacific and Rest of the World markets are the fastest growing markets due to rising economic standards, growing disposable income and high demand for generic drugs. Key players in the global DCM market include Array BioPharma, Inc., AstraZeneca plc, Celladon Corporation, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Merck & Co., Inc., Novartis International AG, Pfizer, Inc., Sanofi S.A., Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., and Vericel Corporation.

By Hannah Lownsbrough / AlterNet May 5, 2017 Print Comments Photo Credit: Tillottama/Shutterstock Big pharmaceutical corporations are far from having an unblemished record when it comes to their treatment of animals. But recent investigations conducted by the German Animal Welfare Foundation have revealed practices involving horses have shocked even experienced animal welfare experts. According to the Animal Welfare Foundation, the German corporation IDT Biologika has fostered a lucrative relationship with horse farms in Argentina and Uruguay in order to procure the hormone PMSG, now more correctly called equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG), for their products. The hormone is only found in the blood of mares in early pregnancy, so farms repeatedly impregnate the horses, and siphon off as many as ten liters of blood in a single session, week after week, over a period of up to 11 months to secure the hormone. Once extracted, PMSG/eCG is mainly used to make products that manipulate the breeding cycle of pigs. Administered by injection, it synchronizes pigs' cycles and makes the industrial production of piglets more efficient.   For some horses, the procedures used to harvest the blood cause anemia and, given the huge volumes of blood removed (up to a quarter of the total blood volume), can send them into shock—or even lead to death. The survivors will have their pregnancies terminated, so the cycle can begin again. Around 30 percent of horses die as a result of this endless cycle of repeated impregnation and blood harvesting. Those that do survive are shipped straight to slaughter once they are too old or weak to become pregnant. For members of SumOfUs (of which I am the executive director), these were facts that could not be ignored. 200,000 of us called on IDT Biologika to do the right thing, delivering a petition to their headquarters in Germany on April 19, when a group of campaign supporters turned up on the doorstep of the corporation. SumOfUs members also bombarded the corporation’s Facebook page, calling on them to justify their practices. We asked for a sit-down conversation with IDT Biologika representatives, but they were not willing to meet. IDT Biologika's refusal to talk is not entirely surprising. Big pharmaceutical corporations have a long history of believing themselves to be above public opinion. Whether finding favor with President Trump or lobbying for trade deals that would push up their profits, big pharma has earned its dubious reputation. The evidence, however, is that no matter how large and powerful the corporation, people power has the potential to challenge their status. Our petition delivery was covered widely in German media, and interest has extended into the international media. Legislators are also starting to pay attention. Last summer, our campaign partners from the Animal Welfare Foundation met with officials at the EU Commission in Brussels to discuss the practice, and officials committed to review the research evidence with a view to taking action. Whatever their approach to addressing the criticism, IDT Biologika can no longer assume that battening down the hatches and disregarding the complaints will make the problem go away. Whatever pharmaceutical corporations choose to believe about their own invulnerability, however, the truth is different. Time and again, activists have proven themselves stronger than big pharma's corporate defenses. People-powered victories against big pharma have a long and honorable history, including wins that produced seismic shifts in global health crises, such as the Treatment Action Campaign’s victories in securing access to affordable medicines to treat and manage HIV/AIDS in South Africa. Smaller-scale breakthroughs are more frequent: SumOfUs members were part of a global outcry in response to the behavior of Martin Shkreli, the hedge fund manager who acquired patents to essential medicines and forced a huge price increase, jeopardizing access to health care for millions of people at risk of contracting malaria, or living with HIV / AIDS. More recently for SumOfUs, our members celebrated progress against pharmaceutical behemoth Merck, Sharp and Dohme (MSD), which recently stopped sourcing the controversial hormone in South America for its European markets. This is an indication that they are becoming concerned about associating themselves with the practice, as the “blood farming” approach has mostly been found in Argentina and Uruguay to date. MSD's starting to distance themselves from these inhumane practices leave IDT Biologika isolated: It is the last manufacturer in Germany that still gets PMSG/eCG from horse blood procured in these farms. The company’s complicity in buying from farms that use these methods damages its brand, and diminishes its public credibility. SumOfUs members have already demonstrated that even "big" pharma is dwarfed when it takes on public opinion. IDT Biologika could save itself a great deal of trouble by reaching the same conclusion, and kicking these cruel processes out of its supply chain.Sign the petition asking IDT Biologika to cut its ties with these cruel blood farms.
