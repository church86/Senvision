Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 22 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Merck Announces Presentation of Phase 2 Results for MK-7264, an Investigational, P2X3 Receptor Antagonist, Being Evaluated for the Treatment of Chronic Cough KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, today announced the presentation of results from a Phase 2 study evaluating the safety, efficacy and therapeutic dose range of MK-7264 (formerly AF-219) for the treatment of chronic cough. The highest dose evaluated, 50 mg, reduced Awake Cough Frequency (coughs/hour), the primary endpoint, by 37 percent from baseline relative to placebo (p=0.003). The 50 mg dose also demonstrated a reduction in patient-reported cough severity. Lower doses (7.5 mg and 20 mg) were not statistically significant. The results were presented today at the American Thoracic Society 113th Annual Conference 2017 in Washington, D.C. MK-7264 is an orally-administered, non-narcotic, P2X3 receptor antagonist. Merck plans to discuss these results and the Phase 3 clinical development plan for MK-7264 with regulatory agencies later this year. “There is a significant unmet need for effective treatments for chronic cough,” said Dr. Jacky Smith, professor of respiratory medicine at the University of Manchester and University Hospital Manchester NHS Foundation Trust. “We are encouraged by the results of the MK-7264 study and look forward to further evaluations of this investigational therapy.” The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study evaluated MK-7264 in patients (n=253) with refractory chronic cough (chronic cough for ≥ 1 year; patients were included in the study per ATS/BTS guidelines). Patients were randomized to receive placebo (n=63), 7.5 mg (n=63), 20 mg (n=63), and 50 mg (n=63) doses of MK-7264 twice daily. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change in Awake Cough Frequency after 12 weeks of treatment vs. baseline. Cough frequency was measured using sound recordings obtained by a digital recording device. Patients who received a 7.5 mg, 20 mg and 50 mg dose of MK-7264 experienced a reduction in Awake Cough Frequency from baseline compared to placebo of 22 percent, 22 percent and 37 percent respectively; the difference for the 50 mg dose compared to placebo was statistically significant (p<0.05). The secondary endpoint of patient-reported Cough Severity (0-100mm on the Visual Analog Scale) compared to baseline showed a reduction of 15.2mm for placebo, 19.2mm for 7.5 mg, 23.4mm for 20 mg and 31.1mm for 50 mg doses. Dysgeusia, an alteration in taste, was the most common adverse event reported in 4.8 percent, 9.5 percent, 33.3 percent and 47.6 percent of patients receiving placebo, 7.5 mg, 20 mg, and 50 mg of MK-7264, respectively. Hypogeusia, reduced ability to taste, was reported in 1.6 percent, 0 percent, 17.5 percent and 23.8 percent of patients on placebo, 7.5 mg, 20 mg, and 50 mg of MK-7264, respectively. One patient in the placebo group and six patients in the 50 mg treatment group discontinued due to taste-related adverse events. No patients in the 7.5 mg and 20 mg groups discontinued due to taste-related adverse events. “These results, from the largest study to date in chronic cough, provide evidence to continue evaluating MK-7264,” said Dr. Andrew M. Tershakovec, executive director, clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. “We look forward to further discussions with regulatory agencies this year to discuss next steps.” About MK-7264 MK-7264 (formerly AF-219) is an investigational orally administered non-narcotic therapeutic candidate that selectively blocks the P2X3 receptor. It is believed that excessive activation of P2X3 receptors is associated with hyper-sensitization of sensory neurons. Neuronal hyper-sensitization in the airways and lungs, triggered by injury or infection, can cause an exaggerated, persistent and frequent urge to cough, so called chronic cough. About Chronic Cough The prevalence of chronic cough (a cough lasting more than 8 weeks) is estimated at ~10 percent of U.S adults. There are currently no approved therapies for the treatment of chronic cough.

Campaign Launched to Raise Awareness of Symptoms (2) Publicado 22/05/2017 16:30:05CET People with a history of thyroid disorders were screened out.   The survey results established respondent's responses to 10 issues that are associated with thyroid disorders. About Thyroid Federation International (TFI)     TFI first convened in Toronto at the 11th International Thyroid Congress in September 1995. Diana Meltzer Abramsky, who in 1980 founded the Thyroid Foundation of Canada in Kingston, Ontario Canada, first advocated the vision of a world thyroid patient organization to deal with the problems of thyroid disease in a global perspective. Since then the Federation has grown to include thyroid organizations in many parts of the world, including Europe, North and South America, Australia, and Japan. TFI is an independent, worldwide network of patient-support organizations. The Federation works together for the benefit of those affected by thyroid disorders by providing information and raising awareness, by encouraging and assisting the formation of patient-oriented groups, and by working closely with the medical professions. TFI has a Medical Advisory Board, which consists of some of the most eminent thyroid specialists in the world.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 22 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman NOVEL NANOBODY TO START CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT IN OSTEOARTHRITIS – ABLYNX TO RECEIVE €15 MILLION MILESTONE PAYMENT GHENT, Belgium, 22 May 2017 – Ablynx [Euronext Brussels: ABLX; OTC: ABYLY] today announced that it has completed the preparation of a pre-clinical package for a novel Nanobody® (ALX-1141) in osteoarthritis. As part of the ongoing collaboration between Ablynx and Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany) on this programme, Merck has accepted the pre-clinical package and this has triggered a €15 million milestone payment to Ablynx. Merck is now responsible for further clinical development of the molecule. ALX-1141 is the first clinical candidate to emerge from the collaboration signed in 2011 between Ablynx and Merck to co-discover and co-develop Nanobodies against two targets in osteoarthritis. Ablynx is eligible for approximately €120 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones plus tiered royalties into double digits upon successful development and approval of the product. Dr Edwin Moses, CEO of Ablynx, commented: „Obtaining pre-clinical proof-of-concept was an important milestone in this collaboration. Our partner Merck has a great deal of experience in osteoarthritis and we are very pleased with their decision to advance this molecule into clinical development. With no disease-modifying drugs currently approved for osteoarthritis, there is a huge unmet need for new treatments. This Nanobody has the potential to become a first-in-class treatment option for patients suffering from this degenerative joint disease. It is the second Nanobody that is expected to enter clinical development originating from the various alliances between Ablynx and Merck. The first is the bi-specific anti-IL17A/F Nanobody for which encouraging results of a Phase Ib study in psoriasis were recently published.” About Ablynx Ablynx is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development of Nanobodies®, proprietary therapeutic proteins based on single-domain antibody fragments, which combine the advantages of conventional antibody drugs with some of the features of small-molecule drugs. Ablynx is dedicated to creating new medicines which will make a real difference to society. Today, the Company has more than 45 proprietary and partnered programmes in development in various therapeutic areas including inflammation, haematology, immuno-oncology, oncology and respiratory disease. The Company has collaborations with multiple pharmaceutical companies including AbbVie, Boehringer Ingelheim, Eddingpharm, Genzyme, Merck & Co., Inc., Merck KGaA, Novartis, Novo Nordisk and Taisho Pharmaceuticals. The Company is headquartered in Ghent, Belgium. More information can be found on www.ablynx.com.

It’s your thyroid.’ Campaign Launched to Raise Awareness of Symptoms 22 maggio 2017 ‘It’s not you. It’s your thyroid.’ Campaign Launched to Raise Awareness of Symptoms PR Newswire DARMSTADT, Germany, May 22, 2017 The information contained in this release is not appropriate for audiences in the USA and Canada. International survey reveals that almost a third of women could not explain what thyroid disorders are    Most respondents were unaware that symptoms could be a result of an underlying thyroid disorder   Merck, a leading science and technology company, today announced its support of the 9th International Thyroid Awareness Week (ITAW), a week that highlights some of the lesser-known aspects of thyroid disorders, which runs from May 22 to 28. This year’s ITAW campaign, ‘It’s not you. It’s your thyroid.’, highlights the striking similarities between the symptoms of thyroid disorders and the effects of today’s fast-paced lifestyles. It is based on results from an international survey commissioned by Merck, in collaboration with Thyroid Federation International (TFI), which reveals many women blame themselves, and their lifestyle choices, for symptoms such as weight changes, irritability, anxiety, insomnia, and excessive tiredness, not realizing that a thyroid disorder could be the underlying cause. Thyroid disorders affect an estimated 200 million people worldwide and in some countries almost 50% of people remain undiagnosed.[1] Thyroid disorders are 10 times more common in women,[2] by the age of 60, 17% of women will develop hypothyroidism, the most common type of thyroid disorder.[3] If thyroid hormone imbalances are undiagnosed and left untreated, they may have a harmful effect on a person’s health and well-being.[4],[5] It is therefore critical that people are aware of the symptoms, and if spotted, they are not ignored. The survey involved women in seven countries, and highlighted the tendency of women to blame their lifestyle choices for symptoms that could be caused by a thyroid disorder.[6] Nearly half (49%) of respondents said they had blamed their lifestyle choices for feeling restless or having difficulty sleeping, while 40% blamed lifestyle choices for feeling depressed, anxious, and tired.[6] In reality, these are common symptoms of a thyroid disorder. This tendency to blame symptoms of lifestyle choices could be further exacerbated by the fact that almost a quarter (23%) of respondents could recall telling a friend or loved one to accept feeling depressed, anxious, or irritable as part of life, while 19% of respondents could recall telling them to accept feeling tired or sluggish every day.[6] Ashok Bhaseen, President of TFI, said: “The survey results highlight an important reason why millions of people go through life without being diagnosed or treated for a thyroid disorder, resulting in a poor quality of life. It reveals that thyroid disorders can be the culprit hiding behind the symptoms that many of us put down to today’s busy lifestyle. We hope it will encourage more people to speak to their healthcare professional rather than dismissing their symptoms as a normal part of everyday life.” The aim of the ‘It’s not you. It’s your thyroid.’ campaign is to help people recognize that they may be wrongly blaming themselves for their symptoms. Some of the symptoms of too little thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) are constipation, lack of motivation, lack of concentration, depression, or weight gain.[7] The symptoms of too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism) include weight loss and irritability.[8],[9] Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can lead to anxiety, menstrual difficulties, and difficulty sleeping.[7],[8] The survey underlined why it can be so difficult to spot a thyroid disorder. Symptoms such as feeling unable to concentrate (29.6%), difficulty getting pregnant (30%), and slow bowel movements and constipation (29%) were not commonly associated with thyroid disorders by respondents.[6] A feature of thyroid disorders that makes them difficult to spot is that the hormones produced in the thyroid gland help regulate many different functions in the body. The symptoms can therefore be diverse and are not specific or unique.[10] Simon Sturge, Chief Operating Officer at Merck’s Biopharma division, said: “Merck is partnering with TFI on the International Thyroid Awareness Week for the ninth year running. Together, we help to ensure that people have the information they need to recognize potential thyroid disorders and see their doctor, rather than blame themselves and accept how they’re feeling. A simple blood test can check whether or not the thyroid gland is functioning normally.” Campaign materials can be accessed via the campaign website at http://www.thyroidaware.com. These include a brochure and an interactive quiz that address misconceptions about the symptoms of thyroid disorder, and provide information to help people identify if they could be suffering unnecessarily. ITAW is now an established and highly regarded global awareness campaign endorsed by the American Thyroid Association (ATA), the European Thyroid Association (ETA), and the Chinese Society of Endocrinology (CSE). For more information visit the ITAW website, http://www.thyroidaware.com. About thyroid disorders   There are two primary types of thyroid disorder: hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, which both have different causes and symptoms. Hypothyroidism, or an underactive thyroid gland, is caused when the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones. This means that the body’s cells can’t get enough thyroid hormones to work properly and the body’s metabolism slows down.[11] Hypothyroidism can have many causes, including autoimmune disease, damage to the thyroid gland, too much or too little iodine, and radiation treatment.[11] Left untreated, the symptoms of hypothyroidism will usually progress, and can cause more serious complications and even become life-threatening.[4] Hyperthyroidism, or an overactive thyroid gland, occurs when the thyroid gland releases too much thyroid hormone in the bloodstream, speeding up the body’s metabolism.[10] Hyperthyroidism tends to run in families, occurring most commonly in young women.[10] The majority of cases of hyperthyroidism are caused by a condition called Graves’ disease.[10] In this condition, antibodies in the blood activate the thyroid gland, causing it to grow in size and secrete too much thyroid hormone.[10] Another type of hyperthyroidism is characterized by nodules or lumps in the thyroid gland, which increase the levels of thyroid hormone in the blood.[10] It is important that the symptoms of hyperthyroidism are not left untreated as serious complications can occur.[5] How common are thyroid disorders?   Thyroid disorders are some of the most-frequent diseases in the world with about 1.6 billion people worldwide at risk.[12] By the age of 60, 17% of women and 8% of men suffer from an underactive thyroid.[3] An underactive thyroid gland is more common in women than in men and its occurrence rises with age. An overactive thyroid gland is 10 times more common in women than in men. It is most common in the age group of 20-40 years, but may occur at any age.[2] About the survey[6] The global omnibus survey was conducted by Censuswide, with online interviews conducted 24-31 January 2017 among the women aged 18 and over. From seven countries worldwide 6,171 women were polled: France – 1,006 respondents Italy – 1,004 respondents Mexico – 1,002 respondents Brazil – 1,003 respondents Saudi Arabia – 151 respondents Chile – 1,001 respondents Indonesia – 1,004 respondents People with a history of thyroid disorders were screened out.   The survey results established respondent’s responses to 10 issues that are associated with thyroid disorders. About Thyroid Federation International (TFI)     TFI first convened in Toronto at the 11th International Thyroid Congress in September 1995. Diana Meltzer Abramsky, who in 1980 founded the Thyroid Foundation of Canada in Kingston, Ontario Canada, first advocated the vision of a world thyroid patient organization to deal with the problems of thyroid disease in a global perspective. Since then the Federation has grown to include thyroid organizations in many parts of the world, including Europe, North and South America, Australia, and Japan. TFI is an independent, worldwide network of patient-support organizations. The Federation works together for the benefit of those affected by thyroid disorders by providing information and raising awareness, by encouraging and assisting the formation of patient-oriented groups, and by working closely with the medical professions. TFI has a Medical Advisory Board, which consists of some of the most eminent thyroid specialists in the world. For more information, please visit http://www.thyroid-fed.org/tfi-wp/.

Campaign Launched to Raise Awareness of Symptoms 'It's not you. It's your thyroid.' Campaign Launched to Raise Awareness of Symptoms maandag 22 mei 2017 09:16 Economie Dit is een origineel bericht van PR Newswire DARMSTADT, Germany, May 22, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The information contained in this release is not appropriate for audiences in the USA and Canada. - International survey reveals that almost a third of women could not explain what thyroid disorders are    - Most respondents were unaware that symptoms could be a result of an underlying thyroid disorder   Merck, a leading science and technology company, today announced its support of the 9th International Thyroid Awareness Week (ITAW), a week that highlights some of the lesser-known aspects of thyroid disorders, which runs from May 22 to 28. This year's ITAW campaign, 'It's not you. It's your thyroid.', highlights the striking similarities between the symptoms of thyroid disorders and the effects of today's fast-paced lifestyles. It is based on results from an international survey commissioned by Merck, in collaboration with Thyroid Federation International (TFI), which reveals many women blame themselves, and their lifestyle choices, for symptoms such as weight changes, irritability, anxiety, insomnia, and excessive tiredness, not realizing that a thyroid disorder could be the underlying cause. Thyroid disorders affect an estimated 200 million people worldwide and in some countries almost 50% of people remain undiagnosed.[1] Thyroid disorders are 10 times more common in women,[2] by the age of 60, 17% of women will develop hypothyroidism, the most common type of thyroid disorder.[3] If thyroid hormone imbalances are undiagnosed and left untreated, they may have a harmful effect on a person's health and well-being.[4],[5] It is therefore critical that people are aware of the symptoms, and if spotted, they are not ignored. The survey involved women in seven countries, and highlighted the tendency of women to blame their lifestyle choices for symptoms that could be caused by a thyroid disorder.[6]  Nearly half (49%) of respondents said they had blamed their lifestyle choices for feeling restless or having difficulty sleeping, while 40% blamed lifestyle choices for feeling depressed, anxious, and tired.[6] In reality, these are common symptoms of a thyroid disorder. This tendency to blame symptoms of lifestyle choices could be further exacerbated by the fact that almost a quarter (23%) of respondents could recall telling a friend or loved one to accept feeling depressed, anxious, or irritable as part of life, while 19% of respondents could recall telling them to accept feeling tired or sluggish every day.[6] Ashok Bhaseen, President of TFI, said: "The survey results highlight an important reason why millions of people go through life without being diagnosed or treated for a thyroid disorder, resulting in a poor quality of life. It reveals that thyroid disorders can be the culprit hiding behind the symptoms that many of us put down to today's busy lifestyle. We hope it will encourage more people to speak to their healthcare professional rather than dismissing their symptoms as a normal part of everyday life." The aim of the 'It's not you. It's your thyroid.' campaign is to help people recognize that they may be wrongly blaming themselves for their symptoms. Some of the symptoms of too little thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) are constipation, lack of motivation, lack of concentration, depression, or weight gain.[7] The symptoms of too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism) include weight loss and irritability.[8],[9] Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can lead to anxiety, menstrual difficulties, and difficulty sleeping.[7], [8] The survey underlined why it can be so difficult to spot a thyroid disorder. Symptoms such as feeling unable to concentrate (29.6%), difficulty getting pregnant (30%), and slow bowel movements and constipation (29%) were not commonly associated with thyroid disorders by respondents.[6] A feature of thyroid disorders that makes them difficult to spot is that the hormones produced in the thyroid gland help regulate many different functions in the body. The symptoms can therefore be diverse and are not specific or unique.[10] Simon Sturge, Chief Operating Officer at Merck's Biopharma division, said: "Merck is partnering with TFI on the International Thyroid Awareness Week for the ninth year running. Together, we help to ensure that people have the information they need to recognize potential thyroid disorders and see their doctor, rather than blame themselves and accept how they're feeling. A simple blood test can check whether or not the thyroid gland is functioning normally." Campaign materials can be accessed via the campaign website at http://www.thyroidaware.com. These include a brochure and an interactive quiz that address misconceptions about the symptoms of thyroid disorder, and provide information to help people identify if they could be suffering unnecessarily. ITAW is now an established and highly regarded global awareness campaign endorsed by the American Thyroid Association (ATA), the European Thyroid Association (ETA), and the Chinese Society of Endocrinology (CSE). For more information visit the ITAW website,  http://www.thyroidaware.com. About thyroid disorders   There are two primary types of thyroid disorder: hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, which both have different causes and symptoms. Hypothyroidism, or an underactive thyroid gland, is caused when the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones. This means that the body's cells can't get enough thyroid hormones to work properly and the body's metabolism slows down.[11] Hypothyroidism can have many causes, including autoimmune disease, damage to the thyroid gland, too much or too little iodine, and radiation treatment.[11] Left untreated, the symptoms of hypothyroidism will usually progress, and can cause more serious complications and even become life-threatening.[4] Hyperthyroidism, or an overactive thyroid gland, occurs when the thyroid gland releases too much thyroid hormone in the bloodstream, speeding up the body's metabolism. [10] Hyperthyroidism tends to run in families, occurring most commonly in young women.[10] The majority of cases of hyperthyroidism are caused by a condition called Graves' disease.[10] In this condition, antibodies in the blood activate the thyroid gland, causing it to grow in size and secrete too much thyroid hormone.[10] Another type of hyperthyroidism is characterized by nodules or lumps in the thyroid gland, which increase the levels of thyroid hormone in the blood.[10] It is important that the symptoms of hyperthyroidism are not left untreated as serious complications can occur.[5] How common are thyroid disorders?   Thyroid disorders are some of the most-frequent diseases in the world with about 1.6 billion people worldwide at risk.[12] By the age of 60, 17% of women and 8% of men suffer from an underactive thyroid.[3] An underactive thyroid gland is more common in women than in men and its occurrence rises with age. An overactive thyroid gland is 10 times more common in women than in men. It is most common in the age group of 20-40 years, but may occur at any age.[2] About the survey[6] The global omnibus survey was conducted by Censuswide, with online interviews conducted 24-31 January 2017 among the women aged 18 and over. From seven countries worldwide 6,171 women were polled: - France - 1,006 respondents - Italy - 1,004 respondents - Mexico - 1,002 respondents - Brazil - 1,003 respondents - Saudi Arabia - 151 respondents - Chile - 1,001 respondents - Indonesia - 1,004 respondents People with a history of thyroid disorders were screened out.   The survey results established respondent's responses to 10 issues that are associated with thyroid disorders. About Thyroid Federation International (TFI)     TFI first convened in Toronto at the 11th International Thyroid Congress in September 1995. Diana Meltzer Abramsky, who in 1980 founded the Thyroid Foundation of Canada in Kingston, Ontario Canada, first advocated the vision of a world thyroid patient organization to deal with the problems of thyroid disease in a global perspective. Since then the Federation has grown to include thyroid organizations in many parts of the world, including Europe, North and South America, Australia, and Japan. TFI is an independent, worldwide network of patient-support organizations. The Federation works together for the benefit of those affected by thyroid disorders by providing information and raising awareness, by encouraging and assisting the formation of patient-oriented groups, and by working closely with the medical professions. TFI has a Medical Advisory Board, which consists of some of the most eminent thyroid specialists in the world.

New Products That Will Drive The Future Pharmaceutical Market - Research and Markets News provided by Research and Markets 22 May, 2017, 19:00 BST Share this article DUBLIN, May 22, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Potential "Pipeline Disruptors" - New Products That Will Drive The Future Pharmaceutical Market" report to their offering. "Pipeline Disruptors" - the innovative therapies that impact current therapies with significant competition and alter the course of treatment. For the purpose of this study, it may affect current therapies that were also considered disruptor innovations at one time or involves a new innovation that is expected to displace other treatments. The pharmaceutical market is fluid and at times can defy predictions of observers of today's pipelines. In recent years, several 'disruptors' have hit the market and pushed aside the current standard treatment protocols. Consider these Two Cases: Gilead Sciences has turned the Hepatitis C (HCV) treatment market upside down, for its competitors at least. In 2013, Gilead began to rollout its new therapies for HCV, of which the company claimed were superior products to the established market. A bold claim considering it was going up against some of the biggest names in biopharmaceutical participation - mainly Merck and Roche. The market showed favor for Gilead's products, which began to erode sales for Merck and Roche's HCV products. By 2015, Gilead had a solid hold on the market with about 80% market share. In December 2014, Bristol-Myers Squibb was granted approval for its PD-1 monoclonal antibody Opdivo (nivolumab). Opdivo was originally granted approval for advanced melanoma; by the end of 2016, lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, lymphoma, and head & neck cancer were also approved. Approvals continue to be pursued and granted for 2017. What will be the next source of disruption in the market?

Immediapress . Pr Newswire . ‘It’s not you. It’s your thyroid.’ Campaign Launched to Raise Awareness of Symptoms ‘It’s not you. It’s your thyroid.’ Campaign Launched to Raise Awareness of Symptoms PR NEWSWIRE Tweet Condividi su WhatsApp Pubblicato il: 22/05/2017 09:16 DARMSTADT, Germany, May 22, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The information contained in this release is not appropriate for audiences in the USA and Canada. Merck, a leading science and technology company, today announced its support of the 9 th International Thyroid Awareness Week (ITAW), a week that highlights some of the lesser-known aspects of thyroid disorders, which runs from May 22 to 28. This year's ITAW campaign, 'It's not you. It's your thyroid.', highlights the striking similarities between the symptoms of thyroid disorders and the effects of today's fast-paced lifestyles. It is based on results from an international survey commissioned by Merck, in collaboration with Thyroid Federation International (TFI), which reveals many women blame themselves, and their lifestyle choices, for symptoms such as weight changes, irritability, anxiety, insomnia, and excessive tiredness, not realizing that a thyroid disorder could be the underlying cause. Thyroid disorders affect an estimated 200 million people worldwide and in some countries almost 50% of people remain undiagnosed. [1] Thyroid disorders are 10 times more common in women, [2] by the age of 60, 17% of women will develop hypothyroidism, the most common type of thyroid disorder. [3] If thyroid hormone imbalances are undiagnosed and left untreated, they may have a harmful effect on a person's health and well-being. [4],[5] It is therefore critical that people are aware of the symptoms, and if spotted, they are not ignored. The survey involved women in seven countries, and highlighted the tendency of women to blame their lifestyle choices for symptoms that could be caused by a thyroid disorder. [6] Nearly half (49%) of respondents said they had blamed their lifestyle choices for feeling restless or having difficulty sleeping, while 40% blamed lifestyle choices for feeling depressed, anxious, and tired. [6] In reality, these are common symptoms of a thyroid disorder. This tendency to blame symptoms of lifestyle choices could be further exacerbated by the fact that almost a quarter (23%) of respondents could recall telling a friend or loved one to accept feeling depressed, anxious, or irritable as part of life, while 19% of respondents could recall telling them to accept feeling tired or sluggish every day. [6] Ashok Bhaseen, President of TFI, said: "The survey results highlight an important reason why millions of people go through life without being diagnosed or treated for a thyroid disorder, resulting in a poor quality of life. It reveals that thyroid disorders can be the culprit hiding behind the symptoms that many of us put down to today's busy lifestyle. We hope it will encourage more people to speak to their healthcare professional rather than dismissing their symptoms as a normal part of everyday life." The aim of the 'It's not you. It's your thyroid.' campaign is to help people recognize that they may be wrongly blaming themselves for their symptoms. Some of the symptoms of too little thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) are constipation, lack of motivation, lack of concentration, depression, or weight gain. [7] The symptoms of too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism) include weight loss and irritability. [8],[9] Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can lead to anxiety, menstrual difficulties, and difficulty sleeping. [7],[8] The survey underlined why it can be so difficult to spot a thyroid disorder. Symptoms such as feeling unable to concentrate (29.6%), difficulty getting pregnant (30%), and slow bowel movements and constipation (29%) were not commonly associated with thyroid disorders by respondents. [6] A feature of thyroid disorders that makes them difficult to spot is that the hormones produced in the thyroid gland help regulate many different functions in the body. The symptoms can therefore be diverse and are not specific or unique. [10] Simon Sturge, Chief Operating Officer at Merck's Biopharma division, said: "Merck is partnering with TFI on the International Thyroid Awareness Week for the ninth year running. Together, we help to ensure that people have the information they need to recognize potential thyroid disorders and see their doctor, rather than blame themselves and accept how they're feeling. A simple blood test can check whether or not the thyroid gland is functioning normally." Campaign materials can be accessed via the campaign website at  http://www.thyroidaware.com. These include a brochure and an interactive quiz that address misconceptions about the symptoms of thyroid disorder, and provide information to help people identify if they could be suffering unnecessarily. ITAW is now an established and highly regarded global awareness campaign endorsed by the American Thyroid Association (ATA), the European Thyroid Association (ETA), and the Chinese Society of Endocrinology (CSE).

About thyroid disorders   There are two primary types of thyroid disorder: hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, which both have different causes and symptoms. Hypothyroidism, or an underactive thyroid gland, is caused when the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones. This means that the body's cells can't get enough thyroid hormones to work properly and the body's metabolism slows down. [11] Hypothyroidism can have many causes, including autoimmune disease, damage to the thyroid gland, too much or too little iodine, and radiation treatment. [11] Left untreated, the symptoms of hypothyroidism will usually progress, and can cause more serious complications and even become life-threatening. [4] Hyperthyroidism, or an overactive thyroid gland, occurs when the thyroid gland releases too much thyroid hormone in the bloodstream, speeding up the body's metabolism. [10] Hyperthyroidism tends to run in families, occurring most commonly in young women. [10] The majority of cases of hyperthyroidism are caused by a condition called Graves' disease. [10] In this condition, antibodies in the blood activate the thyroid gland, causing it to grow in size and secrete too much thyroid hormone. [10] Another type of hyperthyroidism is characterized by nodules or lumps in the thyroid gland, which increase the levels of thyroid hormone in the blood. [10] It is important that the symptoms of hyperthyroidism are not left untreated as serious complications can occur. [5] How common are thyroid disorders?   Thyroid disorders are some of the most-frequent diseases in the world with about 1.6 billion people worldwide at risk. [12] By the age of 60, 17% of women and 8% of men suffer from an underactive thyroid. [3] An underactive thyroid gland is more common in women than in men and its occurrence rises with age. An overactive thyroid gland is 10 times more common in women than in men. It is most common in the age group of 20-40 years, but may occur at any age. [2] About the survey [ 6] The global omnibus survey was conducted by Censuswide, with online interviews conducted 24-31 January 2017 among the women aged 18 and over. From seven countries worldwide 6,171 women were polled: People with a history of thyroid disorders were screened out.   The survey results established respondent's responses to 10 issues that are associated with thyroid disorders. About Thyroid Federation International (TFI)     TFI first convened in Toronto at the 11 th International Thyroid Congress in September 1995. Diana Meltzer Abramsky, who in 1980 founded the Thyroid Foundation of Canada in Kingston, Ontario Canada, first advocated the vision of a world thyroid patient organization to deal with the problems of thyroid disease in a global perspective. Since then the Federation has grown to include thyroid organizations in many parts of the world, including Europe, North and South America, Australia, and Japan. TFI is an independent, worldwide network of patient-support organizations. The Federation works together for the benefit of those affected by thyroid disorders by providing information and raising awareness, by encouraging and assisting the formation of patient-oriented groups, and by working closely with the medical professions. TFI has a Medical Advisory Board, which consists of some of the most eminent thyroid specialists in the world. For more information, please visit  http://www.thyroid-fed.org/tfi-wp/.

Developed by the US-based company in 2006, the vaccine has proved effective in protecting against the virus, better known as HPV, the chief cause of cervical cancer. The virus is found in almost all cervical cancer cases. Gardasil is the first HPV vaccine in the world and the second to be licensed for use in China. In July, Cervarix, an HPV vaccine developed by pharmaceutical GlaxoSmithKline, received approval to be sold on the Chinese mainland after almost 10 years of seeking approval. Gardasil is expected to be commercially available on the mainland in three to six months, which means women will no longer have to seek vaccinations outside of the mainland, such as Hong Kong. After breast cancer, cervical cancer is the second-most common cancer in women ages 15 to 44 in China. Statistics from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention show China reports more than 130,000 cervical cancer cases a year, accounting for 28 percent of global total. The HPV vaccine, as the first anti-cancer vaccine in the world, has proved effective in preventing cervical cancer and is seen as a breakthrough in the fight against cancer. Gardasil offers protection against nine strains of HPV, including the two main cancer-causing varieties: type 16 and type 18. Cervarix offers protection only against types 16 and 18, which account for about 70 percent of all cervical cancer cases. Today, such vaccines are used in about 120 countries and regions, including the United States, Australia and most European countries. As HPV is sexually transmitted, the World Health Organization recommends routine vaccination of girls age 9 to 13 because they are not as likely to have begun sexual activity. Qiao Youlin, a professor of epidemiology at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences' Cancer Hospital in Beijing, said the main target group of Cervarix is females age 9 to 26, although it is theoretically effective for women of all ages. Clinical trials discovered the vaccine is effective for women as old as 45, he said. According to the Securities Times newspaper, Zhifei Biological Products Co in Chongqing will promote, supply and sell the vaccine in China for the next three years. As the exclusive distributor of the vaccine, the company plans to purchase 1.14 billion yuan ($166 million) worth of Gardasil vaccines in the first year, 1.48 billion yuan in the second year and 1.85 billion yuan in the third year, the newspaper said.

Rudolph and Robert C. Stanley Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett & Dunner, LLP Your LinkedIn Connections at Firm December 5, 2015, saw the abrogation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 84 and Form 18, the sample complaint for direct patent infringement. Since that date, courts have uniformly applied the pleading standard set forth in two less recent Supreme Court cases to complaints alleging direct patent infringement. Under this standard, the complaint must provide sufficient factual allegations "to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face." Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). A claim is plausible when "the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678(2009). "Determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief will . . . be a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense." Id., 556 U.S. at 679. In cases brought pursuant to the Hatch Waxman Act, the submission to the FDA of an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) with a Paragraph IV certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement is the "artificial" act of infringement giving rise to a cause of action. 35 U.S.C. � 271(e)(2). The ANDA filer is required to give notice of the Paragraph IV certification filing to the patentee, who then has 45 days in which to bring suit in order to receive a 30-month stay of ANDA approval pending the litigation outcome. 21 U.S.C. � 355(j)(5)(B)(iii). Prior to the receipt of a Paragraph IV notice, a patentee is generally in the dark as to the existence, composition, and properties of the ANDA filer's proposed drug product. Furthermore, the Paragraph IV certification notice letter does not always provide all of the details of the ANDA product, particularly if it does not provide any substantive non-infringement position. During the 45-day period, the patentee can obtain additional information regarding the ANDA product, usually under the terms of an Offer of Confidential Access (OCA) that restrict access of the confidential ANDA information and may forbid any mention of such information in any publicly available pleading. In this post-Rule 84 era, and under the Twombly and Iqbal standards, the patentee must then balance the need to allege sufficient facts to support a plausible claim for patent infringement with its lack of access to information or its potential obligation to keep certain details regarding the ANDA product confidential. Fortunately for the Hatch Waxman Act plaintiff, the Federal Circuit has acknowledged, albeit with respect to Form 18, that "[a] defendant cannot shield itself from a complaint . . . by operating in such secrecy that the filing of a complaint itself is impossible." K-Tech Telecommunications, Inc. v. Time Warner Cable, Inc., 714 F.3d 1277, 1286 (Fed. Cir. 2013). Furthermore, the plausibility standard is a flexible one. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679; see also DermaFocus LLC v. Ulthera, Inc., No. 15-654-SLR, 2016 BL 261077 (D. Del. Aug. 11, 2016) (finding that the plaintiff had given the defendant reasonable notice of a plausible claim for direct infringement using certain, more limited information where "it is not apparent to the court whether the information demanded by the defendant is in the public domain and, therefore, reasonably available to plaintiff"). Where the information needed to eventually prove infringement either rests solely in the hands of the accused infringer or is subject to an obligation of confidentiality, courts generally allow plaintiffs to allege facts "upon information and belief." See Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(3). For example, in Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc. v. West-Ward Pharmaceutical Corp., the second amended complaint presented a claim of induced infringement based on defendant Hikma's "active encouragement of third-party infringement, including Mitigare sales representatives' statements telling healthcare providers to prescribe Mitigare for the unapproved indications covered by Takeda's patents . . . and its distribution of a sales aid which explicitly references [guidelines] that recommend Takeda's patented methods." No. 14-1268-SLR, 2016 BL 414733 (D. Del. Dec. 14, 2016). Hikma argued that Takeda provided no details as to the identity of the persons involved in the conversations or when such conversations took place, and thus dismissal would be appropriate given the Twombly and Iqbal standards. However, "given that Hikma would be the actual source of the requisite factual information, the court conclude[d] that the proposed second complaint contain[ed] sufficiently detailed allegations (1) to plausibly give rise to a claim for inducement of patent infringement, and (2) to give Hikma fair notice of such claim." Id. Similarly, the court in Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. held that the allegation that "[o]n information and belief, Teva has or will have knowledge [sic] that if it were to [make and sell its proposed ANDA product] during the proposed shelf life of the product, such activities would result in the sale and/or use of an infringing article" was sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss. No. 14-874-SLR, 2015 BL 210448 (D. Del. Jul. 1, 2015). Merck grounded its claim of infringement on the theory that the substance present in Teva's ANDA product would convert, during the shelf life of the product, to the claimed substance. Although Merck did not expressly identify and provide details of its conversion theory in its complaint, the court found Merck's allegation plausible, noting that "to rule in favor of Teva on this issue, the court would have to credit Teva's interpretation of Merck's theory over the language of the complaint itself." Id. (also declining "to engage in a fact finding analysis regarding the merits of Merck's theory of liability at the pleadings stage"). Beware, however, that conclusory allegations "upon information and belief" may not suffice in some circumstances. E.g., McDermott v. Clondalkin Grp., Inc., 649 F. App'x 263, 267-268 (3d Cir. 2016) (boilerplate and conclusory allegations unaccompanied by factual allegations that make the claim plausible will not suffice); TeleSign Corp. v. Twilio, Inc., No. 16-2106, 2016 BL 297262 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 3, 2016) (allegation that "[o]n information and belief, Twilio is making, using, selling, offering to sell and/or importing technology similar to the above-mentioned products and services but not known to Telesign" and such related technology "is also within the scope of the 'Accused Technologies'" is "clearly deficient"). In an ANDA case, the plaintiff can generally begin by alleging public facts that can be gleaned from the Paragraph IV notice letter (which is not confidential), the portions of its own product labeling that the ANDA filer must copy, and the fact that ANDA products are generally touted by the ANDA filer as pharmaceutically equivalent, bioequivalent, and therefore therapeutically equivalent to the branded product. For Orange Book-listed patents that have relatively straight-forward claims directed to the active pharmaceutical ingredient or methods of treatment, those factual allegations may well suffice for direct infringement. For other patents, such as for example those directed to particular formulations or polymorphs, the plaintiff should be able to allege confidential or missing information that is likely to have evidentiary support after the discovery process "upon information and belief" and withstand a motion to dismiss.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that every year 16 out of every 100,000 women are likely to be detected with cervical cancer. Globally, it is identified as the third-most commonly occurring cancer and the mortality rate due to this cancer is also quite high.

The research report sheds light on various important parameters including dynamics and competitive landscape of the global HPV testing market. For an extensive understanding, it segments the market on the basis of applications, end users, and geography. It analyses each segment in terms of both revenue and volume. It profiles key players in the market along with their revenue generation, latest developments, business strategies, and contact information. Request Sample Copy of the Report @ https://www.tmrresearch.com/sample/sample?flag=B&rep_id=284 Global HPV Testing Market: Drivers and Restraints Governments are increasingly introducing programs that are promoting awareness regarding cervical cancer screening programs, which in turn is providing a significant push to the HPV testing market. Other than awareness programs, governments are also pouring funds into the research and development of screening kits and devices, which is working in favor of the growth of the market. Despite the initiatives and funding, the continuously changing regulatory guidelines for cervical cancer screening are hampering the growth of the market. Moreover, the lack of favorable reimbursement scenario in several countries is limiting the market from realizing its utmost potential. On the other hand, technological advancements are creating immense growth opportunities for the market. Request TOC of the Report @ https://www.tmrresearch.com/sample/sample?flag=T&rep_id=284 Global HPV Testing Market: Geographical Segmentation The regional markets studied in the report are North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Rest of the World. North America will account for a large share in the market throughout the forecast period.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 22 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Global Therapeutic Vaccines Market is Expected to Witness a Steady Growth by 2021 A vaccine is a biological medical product designed to stimulate antibodies inside human body. Vaccine helps in providing immunity against various infectious diseases. Some of the common types of vaccine include inactivated vaccines, subunit vaccines, DNA vaccines and recombinant vector vaccines. Vaccines may be prophylactic and therapeutic. Therapeutic vaccine is a biological combination designed to develop immunity against a diseased cell or tissues. Therapeutic vaccines are developed to treat ailments from various cancers, HIV and Alzheimer’s disease.Therapeutic vaccine is used for cure and prevention of cancer whereas prophylactic vaccines are only used for prevention of cancer. Therapeutic vaccines are specially designed for HIV positive people who have healthy immune system. A sample of this report is available upon request @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/3705 HIV virus damages human immune system, which results into weaker immune system and thus leading to less ability to fight with microorganisms. Therapeutic vaccines spur the immune system to attack targeted tissue. A therapeutic HIV vaccine is also known as treatment vaccines. Some of the drugs used for HIV treatment include atripla, epzicom, prezista, truvada, kaletra, isentress, reyataz and viread. In addition, there are large numbers of therapeutic vaccines which are under clinical developments. Therapeutic vaccines are also used to treat cancer as they provide greater bioavailability and specificity with minimal side effects. Some of the side effects associated with therapeutic vaccines are swelling, redness, soreness and pain at the site of injection. In addition, mild-flu like symptom is another side effect for therapeutic vaccines. North America followed by Europe is dominating the global therapeutic vaccines market due to increasing accessibility and affordability of highly expensive tests for HIV and cancer. Rising technological support for the development of new vaccines is also fuelling the growth of the North American therapeutic vaccines market. Asia is expected to be the fastest growing market in coming five years due to rising prevalence of various infectious diseases and aging population. In recent time there is increased use of therapeutic vaccines due to rising incidence of diseases such as cancer and HIV. Technological advancements in HIV diagnosis and rising number of clinical trials for HIV and cancer vaccines are some of the key factors driving the growth of the global therapeutic vaccines market. In addition, increasing awareness among people for severe diseases and increasing R&D investments for therapeutic vaccines are also fuelling the growth of the therapeutic vaccines market. However, higher cost of vaccines and less availability of therapeutic drugs are some of the key factor restraining the global therapeutic vaccines market. In addition, stringent regulation for the approval of therapeutic vaccines is also inhibiting the global therapeutic vaccines market. Human papillomavirus mediated malignancies could develop an opportunity for the growth of the global therapeutic vaccines market.

REUTERS/Robert Galbraith/FilesMore By Bill Berkrot and Ben Hirschler (Reuters) - Amgen Inc and UCB SA no longer expect their experimental osteoporosis drug to win U.S. approval this year after a higher rate of serious heart-related side effects were observed in a late-stage clinical trial. The drug, romosozumab, which would be sold under the brand name Evenity if approved, is awaiting an approval decision by the Food and Drug Administration. But the new safety data, which cropped up in an otherwise successful trial, will have to be taken into consideration, delaying any FDA decision and leaving the product's future uncertain. The agency had been expected to make a ruling in July. The news is a blow for both companies and the setback hit smaller Belgium-based UCB hard on Monday, sending its shares down 18 percent. The problem adds to doubts about UCB's long-term growth prospects, given looming biosimilar competition to its Cimzia arthritis drug. Amgen shares were down 2.1 percent at $153.19 on Monday afternoon. The uncertainty over romosozumab sent shares of Radius Health Inc up nearly 8 percent, as its rival drug that won U.S. approval in April will not face competition from much larger Amgen any time soon. The companies did not disclose the nature or severity of the heart-related side effects, but Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said he believed romosozumab now had only a 50/50 probability of coming to market. ISI Evercore analyst Umer Raffat in a research note called the new data "clearly negative and very surprising". Raffat said he was removing all sales of romosozumab from his Amgen forecast models. The drug had been viewed as a potentially important future growth driver for both Amgen and UCB. Analysts on average were forecasting annual sales of the drug to reach about $720 million by 2023, according to Thomson Reuters data. The two drugmakers were measured in describing the problem in a statement issued late on Sunday. "The efficacy results from this study comparing Evenity to an active control are robust. At the same time, the newly observed cardiovascular safety signal will have to be assessed as part of the overall benefit/risk profile for Evenity," Amgen research chief Sean Harper said. "Together with UCB, we will engage with global regulators and medical experts in the field to conduct a thorough evaluation of these data." Romosozumab, which is given as an injection, is also being considered for approval in Canada and Japan. It is designed to increase bone formation and density, thereby reducing the risk of fractures. The medicine met the primary and key secondary goals of a late-stage study. The imbalance in heart-related side effects had not been observed in an earlier Phase III study that had been the basis of the regulatory submission seeking approvals. In the new trial, romosozumab significantly reduced the incidence of new vertebral fractures through 24 months as well as non-vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture compared with Merck & Co's Fosomax. Serious heart problems were reported, however, in 2.5 percent of patients who received the Amgen drug, versus 1.9 percent in the Fosomax group.
