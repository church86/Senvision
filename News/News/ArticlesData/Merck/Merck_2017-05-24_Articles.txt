The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) issued a ‘statement of objections’ against the pharma company - known as Merck & Co in North America - saying that the discount scheme for Remicade (infliximab) was anti-competitive and may have broken UK law. The CMA says the findings of its investigation, which dates back to the end of 2015 are provisional and "no conclusion should be drawn that there has in fact been any breach of competition law", but had decided to make the statement after three rounds of information gathering and reviews in June and November 2016, and March this year. The agency does say that it proposes to find MSD and parent company Merck & Co "jointly and severally liable" for the alleged infringement. In a statement MSD said it was cooperating with the investigation but is "confident that the proceedings will show that MSD has complied with competition law at all times". Remicade - a TNF inhibitor used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis and arthritis psoriasis - has been a massive earner for Merck and marketing partner Johnson & Johnson (J&J), which sells it in markets outside Europe. Global sales reached $8.5bn in 2014 before the onset of biosimilar competition from Hospira (Pfizer) and Celltrion, with Merck recording $2.4bn of that total. By the end of the following year Merck's sales had declined to $1.8bn, and have continued to slide reaching a little under $1.3bn last year. MSD insists that the discounts in question meant that infliximab "was competitively priced and offered savings to the UK National Health Service without hindering competition", while declining to comment further. The action is the latest in a series launched by the CMA into the pharma industry. Last year it fined Pfizer £84m for conspiring with Flynn Pharma to raise the price of epilepsy drug phenytoin, and has since launched an investigation into the pricing of Actavis' hydrocortisone tablets.

Heidi Ledford 24 May 2017 Article tools Rights & Permissions Steve Gschmeissner/Science Photo Library Colorectal cancer cells may have met their match in a treatment just approved by US regulators. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued its first approval of a cancer drug that targets tumours with specific mutations, regardless of where in the body the tumour first took root. This deviates from the agency’s previous approach: although a drug’s use may have been linked to the presence of a particular molecular marker, the FDA still required individual approvals for that drug based on the tumour's location. The new approval, announced on 23 May, expands the use of a drug called pembrolizumab, manufactured by pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co. of Kenilworth, New Jersey. The drug fosters the immune system’s attack on tumours by blocking a protein called PD-1, which normally holds the immune system in check. The FDA had previously approved pembrolizumab for use in several cancers, including lung and skin cancer. But physicians can now use pembrolizumab in any solid tumour that has a particular defect in its ability to repair damaged DNA. Researchers have anticipated such marker-based approvals for roughly a decade, as the rise of molecular profiling — characterizing a tumour based on the genes and proteins that it expresses — promised a shift in cancer treatment.  Similar approvals may be on the horizon as companies begin to structure more of their clinical trials to gather data on a drug’s effects across many different tumour locations. “It’s exciting,” says cancer biologist Trever Bivona of the University of California, San Francisco. “It’ll signal a very clear shift in the way the whole ecosystem operates: the FDA, the companies and the oncologists.” Location, location, location Yet achieving this milestone has been more difficult than many cancer researchers initially thought it would be. Despite early enthusiasm, experience with such therapies over the past decade has taught researchers to respect the influence of a tumour’s location on its response to treatment, says cancer researcher René Bernards of the Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam. “It was a case of irrational exuberance,” he says. “When push comes to shove, the clinical responses were not that impressive.” Bernards speaks from experience. In 2010, researchers reported a successful trial of a drug called vemurafenib, which targets a mutated form of the protein B-RAF[1]. Subsequent studies found that the drug worked in 48% of melanomas with that mutation2. The results came just as cancer genome sequencing efforts were gathering steam, building massive catalogues of mutations found across different cancers. The vemurafenib success fueled hopes that the drug would work in other cancers with the same mutated B-RAF protein. But in colon cancers with the B-RAF mutations, the data were dismal: only about 5% of patients responded to the drug3.   The episode has since become the poster child for the importance of location, Bernards says. His team studied cancer cells grown in culture, and found an additional pathway — active in colon cancer cells but not in most skin cancer cells — that could allow colon cancer cells to escape the effects of vemurafenib4. “Context does seem to matter,” he says. “Big time.” Betting on markers But the pembrolizumab decision shows that a marker-based approach can still work in some cases. In 2015, researchers reported that about 71% of patients whose tumours had a defect in their ability to repair damaged DNA benefited from pembrolizumab treatment, regardless of where those tumours were located5. The defect disables a pathway that repairs mistakes made by the enzymes that copy DNA during cell division. Those mistakes result in mutated proteins that can serve as a signal to the immune system that something is amiss, says James Eshleman, a pathologist at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland. The approval of pembrolizumab for use in these patients is conditional, meaning that Merck must conduct additional trials. It also only applies to advanced cases of cancer. Still, the landmark approval opens doors to other companies betting on this approach. Investigators at Loxo, a company in Stamford, Connecticut, are betting that their drug, called larotrectinib, will also be able to override location-specific cues. Larotrectinib targets abnormal proteins called TRK-fusion proteins, which are caused when two genes fuse together. The resulting proteins spur tumour growth, and Loxo has been testing its drug in any tumour with the fusions. The company will report data from its trials on 3 June at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago, Illinois.   It is unusual for companies to launch such ‘tissue-agnostic’ trials, says Bivona. But he expects the FDA approval to stimulate more companies to try that route — particularly when researchers are targeting patients with a rare molecular marker. Combining participants with the same marker across different tumour types will help boost the number of people that can be enrolled in a particular trial, he notes. “You can get a quicker readout on the effectiveness of the drug,” says Bivona. “Practically speaking, I would say this is the most important upside of this approach.” Journal name: Nature DOI: doi:10.1038/nature.2017.22054 References Flaherty, K.T., et al.

Gain FDA Approval For Pembrolizumab, A Groundbreaking New Cancer Medication Health, Medicine 1 0 0 May 24, 2017 Merck & Co. Gain FDA Approval For Pembrolizumab, A Groundbreaking New Cancer Medication Holly Chavez Pharmaceutical developer Merck & Co. has gained approval for their latest cancer medication, pembrolizumab, from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Originally approved last week for the treatment of urothelial cancer, which is a form of bladder cancer, the scope of pembrolizumab has been expanded by the FDA. Now, Merck & Co. has the green light to begin manufacturing and distributing pembrolizumab to help cancer patients who share a specific genetic marker. Merck & Co.’s pembrolizumab, also known as Keytruda, is a promising option for treating a wide variety of cancers. A Whirlwind Week for Pembrolizumab and Merck & Co. In a groundbreaking approval, the FDA has paved the way for the country’s first cancer medication that isn’t targeted at only one part of the body. In the past, Merck & Co. may not have been able to get the FDA to move further than allowing this treatment to be used by people with bladder cancer. Research indicates this could have greatly reduced the usefulness of a medication that appears to be well-poised to assist adults and children who have two things in common: a cancer diagnosis and the existence of the same biomarker. The potential of this new treatment was highlighted last week when the FDA quickly expanded their approval of pembrolizumab to include mesothelioma. Fortunately, the typical long, drawn out process of getting additional approvals was skipped this time. Instead, the FDA acted very quickly to branch out from urothelial cancer to mesothelioma and, one week later, all cancers with the same biomarker. The unusualness of this type of approval process is perhaps only surpassed by Merck & Co.’s claim that pembrolizumab can help such a diverse list of cancer patients. Whom has the FDA Approved for Pembrolizumab Usage? [Image by Matt Rourke/AP Images] Despite this game-changing approval, pembrolizumab still isn’t currently available to everyone who has the biomarker in question. The FDA did grant accelerated approval for patients who have a tumor with a MSI-H or dMMR genetic marker. However, in order to be eligible for a pembrolizumab prescription, cancer patients also must have metastatic solid tumors and be out of alternative treatment methods. In other words, although the FDA may grant further approvals to Merck & Co. in the future, pembrolizumab can only be used right now as a last resort treatment option for patients who have stage 4 cancer. How Does Pembrolizumab Work? [Image by Gerry Broome/AP Images] As with most new medications, Merck & Co. cannot say with complete certainty exactly how and why pembrolizumab works. It’s strongly believed, though, that pembrolizumab blocks the PD-1/PD-L1 cellular pathway. The targeted biomarkers, MSI-H and dMMR, are found most frequently with colorectal, gastrointestinal and endometrial cancers. These markers contain abnormalities that make it difficult for cells to help themselves via DNR repairs. Per the FDA, by blocking the cellular pathway, pembrolizumab “may help the body’s immune system fight the cancer cells.” In layman’s terms, this means that the FDA and Merck & Co. have seen enough evidence from trials to support the theory that pembrolizumab helps prevent the deterioration of cells. By making it possible for the immune system to combat the negative effects of the cellular pathway, the body gains some much-needed support in the fight against cancer. The Future of Cancer Treatments When the FDA gave Merck & Co. the go-ahead to begin distributing pembrolizumab to any patient who meets the necessary criteria, the government organization also opened the door for a completely new type of cancer treatment. It now seems feasible that future efforts will mostly be targeted toward defeating specific biomarkers instead of aiming to assist just one type of cancer. If pembrolizumab is successful, we can expect the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and companies such as Merck & Co. to approach cancer treatment research differently, which could provide new hope for millions of patients.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Sun Pharma Announces US FDA Filing Acceptance of Biologics License Application (BLA) For Tildrakizumab MUMBAI, India and PRINCETON, N.J., May 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (Reuters: SUN.BO, Bloomberg: SUNP IN, NSE: SUNPHARMA, BSE: 524715, „Sun Pharma” and includes its subsidiaries or associate companies) announces the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) acceptance of the Biologics License Application (BLA) for tildrakizumab. The FDA filing acceptance follows acceptance of the regulatory filing of tildrakizumab by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in March 2017. Tildrakizumab is an investigational IL-23p19 inhibitor being evaluated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The BLA filing for tildrakizumab was submitted by Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA. According to Abhay Gandhi, CEO – North America Business, Sun Pharma, „At Sun Dermatology, we are committed to making a difference in the lives of patients and healthcare providers. The acceptance of the regulatory filing by the U.S. FDA marks a significant milestone as we seek to advance for tildrakizumab as a potential new treatment option for people who continue to struggle everyday with the chronic nature of psoriasis.” The BLA filing for tildrakizumab with the U.S. FDA is based on two pivotal Phase III trials (reSURFACE 1 and 2) which included over 1,800 patients across more than 200 clinical trial sites, including some patients who have been treated with tildrakizumab for up to three and a half years. Data from these trials were most recently presented at the 2017 American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Annual Meeting in March and previously presented at the 25th European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology Congress. Future presentations and publications of the reSURFACE Phase-3 pivotal trials will include more scientific insights on the data to week 52 and beyond. The clinical trials are designed to evaluate safety and efficacy for up to five years, and to date, some clinical trial participants have been treated with tildrakizumab for up to three and half years. About Psoriasis Psoriasis is a chronic immune disease that appears on the skin. It affects an estimated 7.5 million people in the U.S. and approximately 125 million people worldwide1. It is a non-contagious disorder that speeds the growth cycle of skin cells1 and results in thick scaly areas of skin2. The most common form of psoriasis, called plaque psoriasis, appears as red, raised areas of skin covered with flaky white scales, which may be itchy and painful and can crack and bleed2. Despite existing treatment options, many people with plaque psoriasis continue to struggle with the ongoing, persistent nature of this chronic disease. About Tildrakizumab Tildrakizumab is an investigational humanized, anti-IL-23p19 monoclonal antibody designed to selectively block the cytokine IL-23. With this precise targeting, tildrakizumab has the potential to help control the pathogenic cells responsible for the inflammatory process of psoriasis with limited impact on the rest of the immune system. Phase-3 tildrakizumab data provide further evidence for the role of the IL-23 pathway in helping to control the inflammatory process of psoriasis. About Tildrakizumab Phase-3 reSURFACE Trial Design Tildrakizumab Phase-3 studies (reSURFACE 1 and 2) are randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, three-part studies designed to demonstrate efficacy of tildrakizumab in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis compared to placebo and comparative drug and to assess safety and tolerability. Part one of the studies randomized patients into three or four treatment arms, including tildrakizumab 200mg, tildrakizumab 100mg, placebo and etanercept (reSURFACE 2 only). After Week 12 patients on placebo and etanercept were then re-randomized into tildrakizumab 200mg and 100mg treatment arms to proceed into part two of the studies. Finally, in part three of the studies, responders (PASI ≥75) and partial responders (PASI ≥50 and PASI <75) were re-randomized after Week 28 continue the same treatment, a different dose of tildrakizumab or placebo.     The co-primary efficacy endpoint of the two placebo controlled studies were the proportion of patients with Psoriasis Area Sensitivity Index 75 (PASI 75) response at week 12 compared to placebo and the proportion of participants with a Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) score of clear or minimal with at least a 2 grade reduction from baseline at week 12 compared to placebo. The reSURFACE 2 also included a key secondary endpoint comparing tildrakizumab and etanercept on PASI 75 and PGA. Other co-secondary endpoint of both placebo controlled studies included PASI 90 and PASI 100 responses at week 12 and PASI 75, 90 and 100 and PGA responses from baseline at Week 28. PGA measures lesion thickness, erythema and scaling across all of a patient’s psoriasis lesions in order to determine the disease activity on a six-point scale from „clear” to „severe.” A PASI score is a measure of psoriatic plaque redness, scaling and thickness and extent of the involvement in each region of the body. Treatment efficacy is often measured by reduction of PASI from baseline (i.e. 75 percent reduction is known PASI 75), a 90 percent reduction is known as PASI 90 and PASI 100 is total clearance of skin disease.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Merck Manuals Survey: Americans with Digestive Discomfort Take Treatment into their Own Hands KENILWORTH, N.J., May 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Merck Manuals, one of the world’s most widely-used medical resources since 1899, today released the results of a recent online survey revealing that four in five (81 percent) Americans say they have ever suffered from digestive discomfort. Nearly a quarter (23 percent) say they suffer once a week or more often. The survey of more than 2,000 U.S. adults conducted by Harris Poll on behalf of Merck Manuals found that Americans may be reticent to discuss digestion issues such as cramping, bloating, gas, abdominal pains, diarrhea, or constipation with their physicians. Of those who have ever experienced discomfort, just 16 percent say they typically see a doctor to address it. Instead, many seem to attempt to self-treat or simply live with their symptoms. The poll found that among those who have ever suffered from digestive discomfort: 45 percent typically take over-the-counter medications 35 percent typically make changes to their diet 27 percent say they just deal with it 22 percent typically turn to natural treatments or remedies As gluten-free lifestyles and elimination diets continue to increase in popularity as one way to address digestive discomfort, nearly a quarter (24 percent) of Americans say they have a confirmed or suspected intolerance to foods such as gluten or lactose. „Those who think they have an intolerance to gluten or want to try a gluten-free diet should absolutely talk a doctor before they make changes to their diet,” said Dr. Stephanie Moleski, a, gastroenterology specialist at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital and author for the Merck Manuals. „Without some gluten in the system, testing for intolerance and serious conditions like celiac disease is much more difficult for doctors and patients.” Celiac disease is a hereditary intolerance to gluten that can cause diarrhea, undernutrition and weight loss. While the prevalence of celiac disease has been increasing over the last 50 years, it is far outpaced by those opting for a gluten-free diet. The Merck Manuals survey found that if Americans suspected they had a food intolerance, only 36 percent would get tested for food allergies/intolerance before eliminating foods from their diet. Further, before eliminating foods from their diet, Americans indicated they would: Reduce consumption of the food they thought they were intolerant to (47 percent) Conduct online research (32 percent) Talk to family/friends (14 percent) Take medication (13 percent) Only 18 percent stated that they would eliminate the food they thought they were intolerant to immediately. This suggests that many people are unaware of the importance of being tested by a doctor before eliminating wheat, barley, rye, and oats from their diet. „Patients can struggle for years looking for effective forms of relief from food intolerance and functional bowel disorders,” said Dr. Moleski. „Doctors are often able to suggest better treatment alternatives based on family history and specific triggers, but only if patients make the appointment.” Visit MerckManuals.com to learn more about managing functional bowel disorders and food allergies and intolerances. About The Merck Manuals and MSD Manuals First published in 1899 as a small reference book for physicians and pharmacists, The Merck Manual grew in size and scope to become one of the world’s most widely used comprehensive medical resources for professionals and consumers. As The Manual evolved, it continually expanded the reach and depth of its offerings to reflect the mission of providing the best medical information to a wide cross-section of users, including medical professionals and students, veterinarians and veterinary students, and consumers. This year, The Manuals kicked off Global Medical Knowledge 2020, a program to make the best current medical information accessible by up to three billion professionals and patients around the world by 2020.

address digestive discomfort News provided by MerckManuals.com 24 May, 2017, 08:03 ET Share this article KENILWORTH, N.J., May 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Merck Manuals, one of the world's most widely-used medical resources since 1899, today released the results of a recent online survey revealing that four in five (81 percent) Americans say they have ever suffered from digestive discomfort. Nearly a quarter (23 percent) say they suffer once a week or more often. The survey of more than 2,000 U.S. adults conducted by Harris Poll on behalf of Merck Manuals found that Americans may be reticent to discuss digestion issues such as cramping, bloating, gas, abdominal pains, diarrhea, or constipation with their physicians. Of those who have ever experienced discomfort, just 16 percent say they typically see a doctor to address it. Instead, many seem to attempt to self-treat or simply live with their symptoms. The poll found that among those who have ever suffered from digestive discomfort: 45 percent typically take over-the-counter medications 35 percent typically make changes to their diet 27 percent say they just deal with it 22 percent typically turn to natural treatments or remedies As gluten-free lifestyles and elimination diets continue to increase in popularity as one way to address digestive discomfort, nearly a quarter (24 percent) of Americans say they have a confirmed or suspected intolerance to foods such as gluten or lactose. "Those who think they have an intolerance to gluten or want to try a gluten-free diet should absolutely talk a doctor before they make changes to their diet," said Dr. Stephanie Moleski, a, gastroenterology specialist at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital and author for the Merck Manuals. "Without some gluten in the system, testing for intolerance and serious conditions like celiac disease is much more difficult for doctors and patients." Celiac disease is a hereditary intolerance to gluten that can cause diarrhea, undernutrition and weight loss. While the prevalence of celiac disease has been increasing over the last 50 years, it is far outpaced by those opting for a gluten-free diet. The Merck Manuals survey found that if Americans suspected they had a food intolerance, only 36 percent would get tested for food allergies/intolerance before eliminating foods from their diet. Further, before eliminating foods from their diet, Americans indicated they would: Reduce consumption of the food they thought they were intolerant to (47 percent) Conduct online research (32 percent) Talk to family/friends (14 percent) Take medication (13 percent) Only 18 percent stated that they would eliminate the food they thought they were intolerant to immediately. This suggests that many people are unaware of the importance of being tested by a doctor before eliminating wheat, barley, rye, and oats from their diet. "Patients can struggle for years looking for effective forms of relief from food intolerance and functional bowel disorders," said Dr. Moleski. "Doctors are often able to suggest better treatment alternatives based on family history and specific triggers, but only if patients make the appointment." Visit MerckManuals.com to learn more about managing functional bowel disorders and food allergies and intolerances.

The cancer drug has become the first to be approved by the FDA to treat all cancers with a specific tumour biomarker. The US regulator's head of haematology and oncology products, Richard Pazdur, said the development is "an important first for the cancer community" as until now cancer drugs have always been approved based on where the cancer started. "We have now approved a drug based on a tumour's biomarker without regard to the tumour's original location," he added. The new label means Keytruda has been cleared to treat solid tumours that have been identified as having a biomarker referred to as microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or its underlying cause, a DNA repair pathway defect known as dMMR. The biomarker is most commonly seen in colorectal, endometrial and gastrointestinal cancers, occurring in around 5% of all colorectal cancers but is also seen in breast, prostate, bladder, thyroid and other tumour types. All told it is estimated that 1 in 25 tumours display a high degree of microsatellite instability, and diagnostic testing for the biomarker is both cheap and readily available. "We're talking about 5-10% typically in a variety of different tumour types, so it's not a gigantic opportunity," Merck's R&D head Roger Perlmutter said earlier this month, although he noted that the development was very significant in the context of the shift towards personalised medicine. Merck has been granted accelerated approval for Keytruda in this indication based on the results of five uncontrolled single-arm clinical trials involving 149 patients, so it will have to provide additional evidence of the drug's efficacy in further studies if it is to keep the indication on the label. In the initial studies almost 40% of patients saw a partial or complete response with Keytruda at a fixed dose of 200mg every three weeks, and in 78% of them the effect lasted for at least six months. The new approval comes just hours after Merck claimed an accelerated review for Keytruda as a third-line gastric cancer treatment, and a week after it was approved in first- and second-line bladder cancer. The drug has previously picked up approvals in melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), head and neck squamous cell cancer and classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The drug is making big gains even as it faces increasing competition with five drugs in the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor class of immuno-oncology drugs, now approved with at least one cancer indication. Keytruda made $1.4bn for Merck last year adding another $584m to that tally in the first three months of this year. However it still has a way to go before it catches up with current market leader Opdivo (nivolumab) from Bristol-Myers Squibb, which brought in $3.77bn last year and $1.13bn so far this year. BMS reported data last year showing that Opdivo was also effective in MSI-H colorectal cancer, both alone and in combination with its CTLA4 inhibitor Yervoy (ipilimumab).

The Questor Column: Buy CVS, a fast-expanding business that’s immune from the economic cycle: Veterinary services group CVS is the leading player in its field in Britain, generates good earnings and copious cashflow and is busily consolidating its position in its home territory while it starts to build a presence in the Netherlands with carefully chosen and priced acquisitions. The only cloud is a lofty valuation at around 31 times this year’s earnings and 29 times next. But earnings momentum is strong and those multiples could drop sharply as the company expands. The business is underpinned by dependable demand for veterinary services, which are generally not too affected by the ups and downs of the economic cycle. On top of that come the acquisitions. CVS has already added 33 surgeries during the fiscal year that ends in June, including initial forays into both Holland and Northern Ireland, taking the total to 394. More deals, and more new countries, are likely and an equity fund raising just before Christmas of almost £30 million, plus the company’s own free cashflow, gives it plenty of firepower. Questor says ‘Buy’. Update: TalkTalk Telecom: Even after a deeper-than-expected dividend cut, a gloomier-than-expected profit forecast and a thumping share price fall on the day of the full-year results, shares in TalkTalk Telecom have gained 10% since our analysis of the stock in February. As we suggested at the time, TalkTalk’s 8pc-plus dividend yield four months ago was in “too good to be true” territory, especially as earnings failed to cover the pay-out. That said, the cut in the 2018 dividend to 7.5p (from 10.29p in the year just ended and 15.87p before that) was dramatic. Nevertheless, the new planned pay-out still offers a yield of 4.1% and the reduction frees up cash to allow Dunstone and Harrison to invest in the business and rejuvenate its service and brand, as well as tackle its debts. Any profits recovery will be hard fought, given the competitive nature of the telecoms industry, but the new management’s plan appears to be the right one. Questor says ‘Buy’.

Read on... Achaogen Inc.'s (AKAO) lead product candidate Plazomicin, being developed for the treatment of serious bacterial infections due to MDR Enterobacteriaceae, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA. The Company intends to submit its New Drug Application for Plazomicin in the second half of 2017. In other news, Achaogen announced that it has commenced an underwritten public offering of up to 5 million shares of its common stock. AKAO closed Tuesday's trading at $26.08, up 3.57%. Merck's (MRK) blockbuster immunotherapy drug, Keytruda, has scored another FDA approval - this time for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic, microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient solid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options, or colorectal cancer that has progressed following treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. The above indication has been approved under accelerated approval program. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. Keytruda has already received FDA approval for the treatment of metastatic melanoma, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The drug brought home sales of $1.40 billion in 2016, up 148% compared to 2015. In related news, the Company announced that its Supplemental Biologics License Application for KEYTRUDA for treatment of recurrent or advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma has been granted priority review, with a decision date set for Sept. 22, 2017. MRK closed Tuesday's trading at $64.55, up 0.80%. Shares of Neurocrine Biosciences Inc. (NBIX) dropped more than 8% in extended trading on Tuesday, following disappointing results from its phase II study of Ingrezza for treatment of Tourette syndrome in pediatric population. Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurological disorder characterized by repetitive, stereotyped, involuntary movements and vocalizations called tics. (Source: NINDS). The study, dubbed T-Force GREEN, did not meet its primary endpoint of change-from-baseline between the placebo and active groups in the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) at Week 6 in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Ingrezza received FDA approval in the treatment of adults with tardive dyskinesia as recently as April of this year. Ingrezza is the first drug approved by the FDA for tardive dyskinesia. Tardive dyskinesia is a neurological disorder characterized by repetitive involuntary movements, usually of the jaw, lips and tongue, such as grimacing, sticking out the tongue and smacking the lips. The results from a phase II study of Ingrezza in adults with Tourette syndrome, which were reported in January, were also disappointing. The study, dubbed T-Forward , did show a significant improvement in overall symptoms of Tourette syndrome but failed to meet the pre-specified primary endpoint of change-from-baseline in the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale at Week 8. NBIX closed Tuesday's trading at $53.53, down 0.21%. In after-hours, the stock was down 8.09% to $49.20. Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals Inc. (SBPH) reported encouraging top-line results from the initial 25mg monotherapy dosing cohort of the Phase 2a segment of its ACHIEVE trial. The first segment of the ACHIEVE trial is a Phase 2a placebo-controlled, sequential-cohort, double-blind trial to evaluate increasing doses of SB 9200 as monotherapy for 12 weeks followed by Gilead Sciences Inc's Viread 300 mg for an additional 12 weeks. The primary endpoints for the Phase 2a trial are safety and antiviral activity, as measured by the change in HBV DNA at week 12 from baseline, with multiple exploratory secondary endpoints. According to the Company, overall, SB 9200 demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in HBV DNA at week 12 compared to placebo. The Company has begun enrollment in the second cohort (50 mg) of its phase 2a trial, and top-line results are anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Phase 2b segment of the ACHIEVE trial is designed to examine the concomitant use of SB 9200 and Viread in approximately 200 HBV patients. SBPH closed Tuesday's trading at $12.00, unchanged from the previous day's close. Shares of Syndax Pharmaceuticals Inc. (SNDX) plunged nearly 6% in extended trading on Tuesday, following a proposed public offering of its common stock. The Company is planning to offer and sell, subject to market and other conditions, $50 million of its common stock in the underwritten public offering. The underwriters have a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 15% of the number of shares sold in the public offering. Last week, the Company reported results from melanoma cohort of its ongoing phase II trial of Entinostat in combination with Merck's KEYTRUDA. The results showed that the addition of Entinostat can result in meaningful responses in patients who have progressed on an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 regimen like KEYTRUDA, which is an area of very high unmet medical need, according to the Company. SNDX closed Tuesday's trading at $14.67, up 0.41%. In after-hours, the stock was down 5.93% to $13.80. TG Therapeutics Inc.'s (TGTX) phase III trial of TG-1101 + TGR-1202 regimen in patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, dubbed UNITY-CLL, is expected to complete enrollment by this year end, which is earlier than planned. The Company expects to report pivotal Overall Response Rate (ORR) data from the trial in the third quarter of 2018. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) reviewed updated safety data from more than 270 patients in the trial, and finding no safety concerns, has recommended continuation of enrollment without modification. TGTX closed Tuesday's trading at $11.95, up 4.37%. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News The 10 Lowest-Paying College Majors Thrills and Chills: The 10 Most Fun States In America Dubai For Lunch?

It means patients can get more specific care, and could provide a lifeline to those who are not eligible for mainline treatment since their disease has spread.  Keytruda, made by Merck & Co, is a form of immunotherapy which targets solid tumors with a biomarker called microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). These biomarkers are common in colorectal, endometrial and gastrointestinal cancers, but may also appear in cancers of the breast, prostate, bladder, pancreas, thyroid gland and others.  Keytruda, made by Merck & Co, is a form of immunotherapy which targets solid tumors with certain biomarkers, rather than trying to target all kinds of tumors in one body part 'Until now, the FDA has approved cancer treatments based on where in the body the cancer started - for example, lung or breast cancers,' said Richard Pazdur, head of oncology products for the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.  The FDA accelerated approval for the drug to be used for solid tumor cancers not eligible for surgery or that have spread in patients with MSI-H or dMMR.  Dr. Drew Pardoll, director of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute that designed and led the trial that led to the historic approval, called it 'a marriage of cancer genetics and cancer immunology.' Patients whose tumors are laden with the genetic defect have an abundance of abnormal proteins that look more foreign to immune cells, triggering them to search out and destroy the cancer cells. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Mother begs internet to help her find a lung donor for her... At last, an alternative to the flu jab? Scientists... Share this article Share Keytruda belongs to a new class of drugs called PD-1 that block a mechanism tumors use to evade detection from cancer-fighting cells. There are now five such drugs available for a variety of cancers. 'This was one of those eureka trials where it didn't take a lot of patients to see this was going to be something major,' Pardoll said in an interview. He said about 4 percent of advanced cancers, or 15,000 to 20,000 cases each year in the United States, carry the genetic traits addressed in the approval. This was one of those eureka trials where it didn't take a lot of patients to see this was going to be something major  Dr. Drew Pardoll, director of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute Tests for the specific genetic defects are widely available, costing between $300 and $600.  The approval covers children and adults whose cancer has progressed despite prior treatment and those who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options, including patients whose colorectal cancer has progressed following chemotherapy. The FDA grants accelerated approvals to drugs for serious conditions with unmet medical needs if the treatment appears to have effects deemed reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit. Merck must still conduct studies to confirm the anticipated benefit. The approval further solidifies Merck's leading position in the burgeoning field of treatments that help the immune system fight cancer, a mantle it seized last year when Keytruda extended survival as an initial treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Keytruda was previously approved to treat advanced melanoma, advanced NSCLC, head and neck cancers and classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Last week it won U.S. approval for bladder cancer and is awaiting an FDA decision for gastric cancer.

evaluated for treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis News provided by Sun Pharma 24 May, 2017, 08:03 ET Share this article MUMBAI, India and PRINCETON, N.J., May 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (Reuters: SUN.BO, Bloomberg: SUNP IN, NSE: SUNPHARMA, BSE: 524715, "Sun Pharma" and includes its subsidiaries or associate companies) announces the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) acceptance of the Biologics License Application (BLA) for tildrakizumab. The FDA filing acceptance follows acceptance of the regulatory filing of tildrakizumab by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in March 2017. Tildrakizumab is an investigational IL-23p19 inhibitor being evaluated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The BLA filing for tildrakizumab was submitted by Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA. According to Abhay Gandhi, CEO - North America Business, Sun Pharma, "At Sun Dermatology, we are committed to making a difference in the lives of patients and healthcare providers. The acceptance of the regulatory filing by the U.S. FDA marks a significant milestone as we seek to advance for tildrakizumab as a potential new treatment option for people who continue to struggle everyday with the chronic nature of psoriasis." The BLA filing for tildrakizumab with the U.S. FDA is based on two pivotal Phase III trials (reSURFACE 1 and 2) which included over 1,800 patients across more than 200 clinical trial sites, including some patients who have been treated with tildrakizumab for up to three and a half years. Data from these trials were most recently presented at the 2017 American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Annual Meeting in March and previously presented at the 25th European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology Congress. Future presentations and publications of the reSURFACE Phase-3 pivotal trials will include more scientific insights on the data to week 52 and beyond. The clinical trials are designed to evaluate safety and efficacy for up to five years, and to date, some clinical trial participants have been treated with tildrakizumab for up to three and half years. About Psoriasis Psoriasis is a chronic immune disease that appears on the skin. It affects an estimated 7.5 million people in the U.S. and approximately 125 million people worldwide1. It is a non-contagious disorder that speeds the growth cycle of skin cells1 and results in thick scaly areas of skin2. The most common form of psoriasis, called plaque psoriasis, appears as red, raised areas of skin covered with flaky white scales, which may be itchy and painful and can crack and bleed2. Despite existing treatment options, many people with plaque psoriasis continue to struggle with the ongoing, persistent nature of this chronic disease. About Tildrakizumab Tildrakizumab is an investigational humanized, anti-IL-23p19 monoclonal antibody designed to selectively block the cytokine IL-23. With this precise targeting, tildrakizumab has the potential to help control the pathogenic cells responsible for the inflammatory process of psoriasis with limited impact on the rest of the immune system. Phase-3 tildrakizumab data provide further evidence for the role of the IL-23 pathway in helping to control the inflammatory process of psoriasis. About Tildrakizumab Phase-3 reSURFACE Trial Design Tildrakizumab Phase-3 studies (reSURFACE 1 and 2) are randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, three-part studies designed to demonstrate efficacy of tildrakizumab in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis compared to placebo and comparative drug and to assess safety and tolerability. Part one of the studies randomized patients into three or four treatment arms, including tildrakizumab 200mg, tildrakizumab 100mg, placebo and etanercept (reSURFACE 2 only). After Week 12 patients on placebo and etanercept were then re-randomized into tildrakizumab 200mg and 100mg treatment arms to proceed into part two of the studies. Finally, in part three of the studies, responders (PASI ≥75) and partial responders (PASI ≥50 and PASI <75) were re-randomized after Week 28 continue the same treatment, a different dose of tildrakizumab or placebo.     The co-primary efficacy endpoint of the two placebo controlled studies were the proportion of patients with Psoriasis Area Sensitivity Index 75 (PASI 75) response at week 12 compared to placebo and the proportion of participants with a Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) score of clear or minimal with at least a 2 grade reduction from baseline at week 12 compared to placebo. The reSURFACE 2 also included a key secondary endpoint comparing tildrakizumab and etanercept on PASI 75 and PGA. Other co-secondary endpoint of both placebo controlled studies included PASI 90 and PASI 100 responses at week 12 and PASI 75, 90 and 100 and PGA responses from baseline at Week 28. PGA measures lesion thickness, erythema and scaling across all of a patient's psoriasis lesions in order to determine the disease activity on a six-point scale from "clear" to "severe." A PASI score is a measure of psoriatic plaque redness, scaling and thickness and extent of the involvement in each region of the body. Treatment efficacy is often measured by reduction of PASI from baseline (i.e. 75 percent reduction is known PASI 75), a 90 percent reduction is known as PASI 90 and PASI 100 is total clearance of skin disease. About Sun Dermatology Sun Pharma is committed to expanding our dermatology portfolio to bring healthcare providers and patients around the world more treatment options and ongoing support for conditions with high unmet medical needs like psoriasis. Sun Pharma, along with its subsidiaries, is ranked fourth in dermatology prescription volume within the U.S. per IMS and is fifth largest specialty generic pharmaceutical company globally.

For further information, please visit www.sunpharmaderm.com About Sun Pharma, Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA, Agreement Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.'s wholly owned subsidiary acquired worldwide rights to tildrakizumab from Merck (through a Merck subsidiary), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, in 2014.

Credit: Steve Gschmeissner Getty Images Advertisement | Report Ad By Natalie Grover and Bill Berkrot Merck & Co's immunotherapy Keytruda chalked up another approval on Tuesday as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said the cancer medicine can be used to treat children and adults who carry a specific genetic feature regardless of where the disease originated. It is the first time the agency has approved a cancer treatment based solely on a genetic biomarker. "Until now, the FDA has approved cancer treatments based on where in the body the cancer started - for example, lung or breast cancers," said Richard Pazdur, head of oncology products for the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. "We have now approved a drug based on a tumor's biomarker without regard to the tumor's original location." The accelerated approval was for solid tumor cancers not eligible for surgery or that have spread in patients identified as having a biomarker called microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). Tumors with those traits are most common in colorectal, endometrial and gastrointestinal cancers, but may also appear in cancers of the breast, prostate, bladder and thyroid gland. The approval covers patients whose cancer has progressed despite prior treatment and those who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. It also includes patients with colorectal cancer whose disease has advanced after chemotherapy. The FDA grants accelerated approvals to drugs for serious conditions with unmet medical needs if the treatment appears to have certain effects deemed reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit. Merck must still conduct studies to confirm the anticipated benefit. Keytruda belongs to a new class of drugs called PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors that help the immune system fight cancer by blocking a mechanism tumors use to evade detection. It was previously approved to treat advanced melanoma, advanced non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck cancers and classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Merck shares rose 0.8 percent to $64.55.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Sun Pharma Announces US FDA Filing Acceptance of Biologics License Application (BLA) For Tildrakizumab Tildrakizumab is being evaluated for treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis MUMBAI, India and PRINCETON, N.J., May 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (Reuters: SUN.BO, Bloomberg: SUNP IN, NSE: SUNPHARMA, BSE: 524715, "Sun Pharma" and includes its subsidiaries or associate companies) announces the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) acceptance of the Biologics License Application (BLA) for tildrakizumab. The FDA filing acceptance follows acceptance of the regulatory filing of tildrakizumab by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in March 2017. Tildrakizumab is an investigational IL-23p19 inhibitor being evaluated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The BLA filing for tildrakizumab was submitted by Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA. According to Abhay Gandhi, CEO - North America Business, Sun Pharma, "At Sun Dermatology, we are committed to making a difference in the lives of patients and healthcare providers. The acceptance of the regulatory filing by the U.S. FDA marks a significant milestone as we seek to advance for tildrakizumab as a potential new treatment option for people who continue to struggle everyday with the chronic nature of psoriasis." The BLA filing for tildrakizumab with the U.S. FDA is based on two pivotal Phase III trials (reSURFACE 1 and 2) which included over 1,800 patients across more than 200 clinical trial sites, including some patients who have been treated with tildrakizumab for up to three and a half years. Data from these trials were most recently presented at the 2017 American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Annual Meeting in March and previously presented at the 25th European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology Congress. Future presentations and publications of the reSURFACE Phase-3 pivotal trials will include more scientific insights on the data to week 52 and beyond. The clinical trials are designed to evaluate safety and efficacy for up to five years, and to date, some clinical trial participants have been treated with tildrakizumab for up to three and half years. About Psoriasis Psoriasis is a chronic immune disease that appears on the skin. It affects an estimated 7.5 million people in the U.S. and approximately 125 million people worldwide1. It is a non-contagious disorder that speeds the growth cycle of skin cells1 and results in thick scaly areas of skin2. The most common form of psoriasis, called plaque psoriasis, appears as red, raised areas of skin covered with flaky white scales, which may be itchy and painful and can crack and bleed2. Despite existing treatment options, many people with plaque psoriasis continue to struggle with the ongoing, persistent nature of this chronic disease. About Tildrakizumab Tildrakizumab is an investigational humanized, anti-IL-23p19 monoclonal antibody designed to selectively block the cytokine IL-23. With this precise targeting, tildrakizumab has the potential to help control the pathogenic cells responsible for the inflammatory process of psoriasis with limited impact on the rest of the immune system. Phase-3 tildrakizumab data provide further evidence for the role of the IL-23 pathway in helping to control the inflammatory process of psoriasis. About Tildrakizumab Phase-3 reSURFACE Trial Design Tildrakizumab Phase-3 studies (reSURFACE 1 and 2) are randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, three-part studies designed to demonstrate efficacy of tildrakizumab in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis compared to placebo and comparative drug and to assess safety and tolerability. Part one of the studies randomized patients into three or four treatment arms, including tildrakizumab 200mg, tildrakizumab 100mg, placebo and etanercept (reSURFACE 2 only). After Week 12 patients on placebo and etanercept were then re-randomized into tildrakizumab 200mg and 100mg treatment arms to proceed into part two of the studies. Finally, in part three of the studies, responders (PASI ≥75) and partial responders (PASI ≥50 and PASI <75) were re-randomized after Week 28 continue the same treatment, a different dose of tildrakizumab or placebo.     The co-primary efficacy endpoint of the two placebo controlled studies were the proportion of patients with Psoriasis Area Sensitivity Index 75 (PASI 75) response at week 12 compared to placebo and the proportion of participants with a Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) score of clear or minimal with at least a 2 grade reduction from baseline at week 12 compared to placebo. The reSURFACE 2 also included a key secondary endpoint comparing tildrakizumab and etanercept on PASI 75 and PGA. Other co-secondary endpoint of both placebo controlled studies included PASI 90 and PASI 100 responses at week 12 and PASI 75, 90 and 100 and PGA responses from baseline at Week 28. PGA measures lesion thickness, erythema and scaling across all of a patient's psoriasis lesions in order to determine the disease activity on a six-point scale from "clear" to "severe." A PASI score is a measure of psoriatic plaque redness, scaling and thickness and extent of the involvement in each region of the body. Treatment efficacy is often measured by reduction of PASI from baseline (i.e. 75 percent reduction is known PASI 75), a 90 percent reduction is known as PASI 90 and PASI 100 is total clearance of skin disease.

(Reuters/Jeff Zelevansk) Share Written by Ephrat Livni May 24, 2017 Cancer care is changing. Someday soon doctors may not be so concerned with whether the disease originates in the colon, lungs, or breast. Instead of categorizing cancers by body parts, they’ll use biomarkers like MSI-H or dMMR to identify and treat the illness. On May 23, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval to pembrolizumab, made by Merck and marketed as Keytruda, for adults and children without remaining treatment alternatives and with metastatic solid tumors identified with a biomarker called microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). Tumors with MSI-H and dMMR markers—most commonly found in colorectal, endometrial, and gastrointestinal cancers—have abnormalities that affect DNA repair inside the cell. It’s believed that Keytruda works by blocking a cellular pathway known as PD-1/PD-L1, containing proteins found on the body’s immune cells and some cancer cells. The drug “may help the body’s immune system fight the cancer cells” but the FDA doesn’t specify how. In clinical trials, pembrolizumab showed promise treating cancers originating in 15 different locations. The FDA decision is based on a study of 90 patients with colorectal cancer and 59 patients diagnosed with one of 14 other cancer types. Of these 149 patients, 39% had a complete or partial shrinkage of tumors, which for 78% of patients lasted for six months or more. It’s not perfect, and more research has to be done, but the approval is a landmark because it’s the first time a cancer treatment that is not site- or tissue-specific has received the agency’s approval. (The drug had already been approved for certain specific cancer treatments—metastatic melanoma, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer, refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and urothelial carcinoma.) “This is an important first for the cancer community,” said Richard Pazdur, of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research in a statement. “Until now, the FDA has approved cancer treatments based on where in the body the cancer started—for example, lung or breast cancers. We have now approved a drug based on a tumor’s biomarker without regard to the tumor’s original location.” The approval is an old dream come true for some cancer researchers. Gates Foundation CEO Sue Desmond-Hellman, formerly chief cancer drug developer at Genentech and a pioneer in the field of gene-targeted cancer drugs, said as much on Twitter upon hearing the news. 20 yrs ago at Genentech I gave a speech dreaming of a cancer clinic with doors saying "HER2, EGFR, ..", not "Breast, Kidney,…" Maybe now? https://t.co/d3F55qOktl — Sue Desmond-Hellmann (@SueDHellmann) May 23, 2017 It’s also great news for the drug maker Merck, and it came at the perfect time; earlier the same day, the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority accused the US-based pharma company of “offering unfair discounts” on infliximab, its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease drug, to “discourage new competitors,” according to the Financial Times. Next month, Merck will present the findings of 50 studies testing pembrolizumab’s use on 16 different cancers at the 53rd Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. But much remains to be done. The FDA expects Merck to conduct more testing on pembrolizumab’s efficacy for cancer treatment according to genetic markers. Accelerated approval for experimental drugs is only granted where there is an unmet medical need for a serious condition; in this case “serious condition” includes multiple cancers now classified by two genetic markers. The drug was shown to have “certain effects that are reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit to patients,” according to the FDA. That’s not quite a ringing endorsement—it’s more like a muted grant of permission to keep working on it and come back soon. In the agency’s words, “Further study is required to verify and describe anticipated clinical benefits of Keytruda, and the sponsor is currently conducting these studies in additional patients with MSI-H or dMMR tumors.” Most Popular Amazon’s first bookstore in New York City sucks the joy out of buying books Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

Meet the Contributors → FDA Landmark Nod: Cancer Drug To Match Tumor Genes, Not Tissue Type Ben Fidler May 23rd, 2017 @benthefidler @xconomy Like Us Xconomy National —  For many years, doctors and researchers have known that cancers in different parts of the body can share genetic abnormalities. For the first time, the FDA has approved a drug based on those abnormalities and not on the organ in which the cancer originated. It’s a moment that a lot of people in the cancer field have been waiting for. The CEO of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and former top Genentech official Susan Desmond-Hellman wrote on Twitter: “20 yrs ago at Genentech I gave a speech dreaming of a cancer clinic with doors saying ‘HER2, EGFR, ..’, not ‘Breast, Kidney,…’ Maybe now?” (HER2 and EGFR are well-known genetic alterations in various cancers.) The approval is for pembrolizumab (Keytruda), which has already received approval in skin, lung, bladder, and other cancers. The FDA now says pembrolizumab, from Kenilworth, NJ-based Merck (NYSE: MRK), can be used for children and adults whose advanced solid tumors have conditions known as microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR), and haven’t responded to prior treatment. MSI-H and dMMR tumors have lost the ability that cells normally use to repair their own DNA errors. Without that ability, cells with DNA errors can proliferate and turn into cancer. “This is an important first for the cancer community,” said Richard Pazdur, the acting director of the FDA’s office of hematology and oncology products, in the agency’s announcement. MSI-H and dMMR cells can be found in patients with several tumor types, including colorectal, endometrial, and stomach cancers. About 5 percent of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, for example, have MSI-H or dMMR tumors, according to the FDA’s statement. The FDA decision was based on five clinical trials enrolling 149 patients with MSI-H or dMMR solid tumors across 15 cancer types. Of the 149 patients, 39.6 percent had at least a partial response to treatment, meaning their tumors shrunk. The response lasted at least six months for 78 percent of those patients. Drew Pardoll, the director of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy—where, it should be noted, the early research regarding these genetic insights originated—told Xconomy that patients with MSI-H or dMMR tumors tend to respond very poorly to chemotherapy. Their luck has now changed, he says. Genetic testing is now available to identify these abnormalities, and people with these tumors tend to respond well to treatment with a so-called checkpoint inhibitor that blocks a protein called PD-1, like Merck’s pembrolizumab. “I predict that this is going to be the single most commonly done genetic test in oncology,” Pardoll said. “It’s going to be done all over the place.” Johns Hopkins has filed for a patent for a companion diagnostic testing for MSI-H or dMMR tumors, and has licensed that technology to a company in Baltimore called Personal Genome Diagnostics. A Johns Hopkins spokesperson said the institution may thus stand to benefit, but it’s not clear to what extent since the test is already widely used and can be done by many companies and hospitals. The approval could help push adoption of broad cancer genetic tests, which insurers have been slow to cover. The more evidence that tests are steering patients to better results from expensive therapies—and away from therapies that are not likely to benefit them—the more chance insurers will pay for those tests, said Dana-Farber Cancer Institute president and CEO Laurie Glimcher at an Xconomy forum last week. “It’s going to cost some money to do those kinds of tests,” said Glimcher. “But ultimately you’re not going to be putting patients on drugs that you can predict they will not respond to. I have to believe that the economics will eventually triumph.” Cancer immunotherapies have produced stunning results in recent years, but they face significant limitations. Only a fraction of patients respond to drugs like pembrolizumab and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s nivolumab (Opdivo), and researchers are still trying to figure out why. Companies are combining these drugs with a variety of others hoping more patients will respond, and more cancers will be impacted. Many of these studies, however, will likely fail. Finding more biomarkers like MSI-H, and uncovering more genetic clues as to why two patients with the same type of cancer will have different results, could help increase the odds of success. “I worry that [so many companies] race into phase 3 trials and there’s not enough biomarker work to understand why things work and why they don’t work,” Pardoll said. The FDA’s decision was an “accelerated” approval, on a thinner body of evidence than is typically required. That means that the FDA can withdraw its approval if the drug fails to show the anticipated benefit in ongoing studies. Ben Fidler is Xconomy's Deputy Biotechnology Editor.

Wilson Sonsini tops Life Sciences Law Firm Index for 2nd straight year Biotech, Pharma In landmark move, FDA approves cancer drug for a biomarker not a tissue By Juliet Preston Post a comment / May 23, 2017 at 8:39 PM Shares478 Colon, pancreatic, stomach, or ovarian cancer; it increasingly shouldn’t matter. In an era of precision medicine, the treatment approach should reflect the genetic makeup of the person’s tumor and the presence or absence of key biomarkers. That ethos was set in stone on Tuesday, with the landmark FDA approval of Merck’s checkpoint inhibitor, Keytruda (pembrolizumab), for patients with solid tumors that express so-called mismatched repair genes. In a statement, FDA noted the historic nature of its decision. “This is the first time the agency has approved a cancer treatment based on a common biomarker rather than the location in the body where the tumor originated.” It has been a long time in the making. Scientists’ understanding of cancer has shifted dramatically in the 21st Century, helped along by initiatives such as the human genome project and the advent of next-generation sequencing. One of the biggest revelations has been the degree of heterogeneity between cancers that arise from a single tissue: A breast cancer might be more akin to a melanoma than another breast cancer. As a result, it often makes sense to classify cancers based on their genetics, not their origin, when selecting oncology treatments. Following today’s approval, one the defining features of certain solid tumors will be whether they are microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). Both are abnormalities that affect the proper repair of DNA inside the cell (aka mismatch repair genes). According to FDA, colorectal, endometrial and gastrointestinal cancers have the highest rates of these mutations. MSI-H and dMMR also appear, albeit less commonly, in cancers arising in the breast, prostate, bladder, thyroid gland and other places. Approximately 5 percent of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer have MSI-H or dMMR tumors. Scientists at the Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy at Johns Hopkins Medicine were the first to hypothesize that tumors with these mismatch repair genes would be particularly susceptible to immunotherapies, such as Keytruda. The idea was advanced into clinical trials and ultimately given the green light via FDA’s accelerated approval route. “I think that this is a really positive development for a couple of reasons,” said Joydeep Goswami, president, clinical NGS and oncology at Thermo Fisher Scientific, in online correspondence. “First, it reinforces the idea of cancer treatment being stratified by the molecular signature of the tumor. Second, it clarifies that the molecular signature of a tumor is more significant than the organ of origin. Both these emphasize the molecular nature of cancer and confirm the need to tie therapy selection to the precise molecular signature in order to ensure the best patient outcomes.” Keytruda is already approved for the treatment of certain patients with metastatic melanoma, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer, refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and urothelial carcinoma. Other checkpoint inhibitors, such as Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo, are hot on Merck’s heels chasing market share. Is medicine ready? It’s one thing to get an FDA approval, it’s another to implement this form of medicine nationwide. As many observers noted on Twitter, oncologists often specialize based on the tissue of origin. They’re colon cancer or breast cancer experts. Perhaps more importantly, the bulk of cancer patients in the U.S. still aren’t having their tumors sequenced. The next-generation sequencing diagnostics can cost thousands of dollars and insurers have argued that the clinical utility isn’t there. Medicare and Medicaid have taken the same stance. Today’s approval could help the industry move forward. Indeed, it has been noted that the lack of routine sequencing holds back recruitment for clinical trials, which in turn limits the approval of drugs that would validate the sequencing. Scott Tomlins, co-founder and laboratory director of Strata Oncology, stressed via email that there is much more work to be done to break this treatment stalemate. Strata deals with it firsthand through its work matching eligible patients with precision medicine trials. “Results like this confirm that we should be assessing the critical and targetable molecular alterations driving every individual’s cancer,” Tomlins said. “However, it is critical to recognize that with presently available drugs, only a small subset of patients with cancer are likely to benefit from this or most other targeted therapies. Thus, finding patients whose tumors have highly targetable alterations, and enrolling them onto the most appropriate clinical trials remain the critical barriers to accelerating approval of promising therapies and gaining widespread reimbursement for molecular profiling.” There’s also value in ruling out patients that are unlikely to respond to personalized therapies. Keytruda launched in the U.S. with a list price of $12,500 per patient per month, or $150,000 per year. Many trials are underway studying checkpoint inhibitors as part of combination therapies, which would see the cost climb further. The case is definitely building for genetic testing, as means to finding the right individuals and saving the expense and struggle of treating those who are unlikely to benefit.

Stem Cell Treatment Colon Cancer: What To Know Lung Cancer: Visual Guide Hodgkin Lymphoma: Learn More Find an Oncologist Cancer A-Z Guide Cancer News FDA OKs First Cancer Drug by Genetic Type, Not Organ of Origin Keytruda is targeted to specific cancers with specific DNA that can arise in multiple sites By Randy Dotinga HealthDay Reporter WEDNESDAY, May 24, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Many new cancer drugs target genetic "biomarkers" that are specific to tumors -- wherever in the body they may appear. So on Tuesday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced that, for the first time, it had approved a cancer drug based on disease genetics rather than the body part where the cancer originated. The drug, Keytruda (pembrolizumab), is targeted to what are called "mismatch repair genes," and its approval means it can be used to fight tumors with these genes wherever they appear -- in the colon, pancreas, stomach, ovaries or other body sites. "This is an important first for the cancer community," Dr. Richard Pazdur, acting director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in an agency news release. "Until now, the FDA has approved cancer treatments based on where in the body the cancer started -- for example, lung or breast cancers," said Pazdur, who also directs the FDA's Oncology Center of Excellence. "We have now approved a drug based on a tumor's biomarker without regard to the tumor's original location." Keytruda, made by Merck & Co., targets tumors with DNA known as microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). As the FDA explained, these gene abnormalities affect repair mechanisms inside the cell. "Tumors with these biomarkers are most commonly found in colorectal, endometrial and gastrointestinal cancers, but also less commonly appear in cancers arising in the breast, prostate, bladder, thyroid gland and other places," the FDA said in the news release. "Approximately 5 percent of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer have MSI-H or dMMR tumors." Keytruda works by targeting a cellular pathway that helps the body's own immune system attack the cancer cells. The drug had previously received separate approval for a variety of tumor types, such as metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic melanoma, and other cancers. That approval has been widened and Keytruda is now allowed for the treatment of adults and children with certain tumors that can't be surgically removed, or solid tumors that have spread. Continued The FDA said the drug is approved for use in two kinds of patients: Those who don't have alternatives after tumors have progressed after treatment; and those with colorectal cancer that's progressed after treatment with certain chemotherapy drugs. The FDA said 149 patients with tumors with the biological variations -- 15 tumor types in all -- took part in five separate studies that led to the new approval. Tumors responded by either completely or partially shrinking in 40 percent of the patients. The findings also showed that more than three-quarters of those patients had a response for at least six months. The drug has many side effects, including some that are serious -- such as inflammation of healthy organs -- so patients who experience those complications should stop taking the drug. Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding should not take the drug.

Follow The Daily Beast on Twitter Like The Daily Beast on Facebook Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast SWAMP CREATURES Pro-Trumpcare Republicans Owned Millions in Health-Care Stock Forty lawmakers who voted for AHCA had more than $23 million in investments and made more than $2 million in profit. And some of the most heavily invested cast key votes. Justin Glawe 05.24.17 1:00 AM ET Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast Forty Republican representatives who voted for the American Health Care Act held shares in health-care companies valued at $23 million and earned more than $2 million off those investments, a Daily Beast review of the most-recent financial records found. The investments may be valued at as high as $39 million and took in as much as $6 million in profits, according to the disclosure reports that require members of Congress to report investments and income within a certain price range. Several Republicans with key roles in passing the bill held more than $500,000 in medical company shares. The majority of the companies in which lawmakers own stock represent the giants of the pharmaceutical and medical-device industries. Republicans owned between $1.3 million and $4.9 million in shares of Abbott Labs, Johnson & Johnson, and 3M, three of the country’s largest medical-device manufacturers. They also owned between $2.7 million and $5.5 million in pharmaceutical giants Merck, Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer, and Shire. The AHCA would benefit these companies by eliminating billions of dollars in taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical-device manufacturers—a provision of the bill that doesn’t reflect a violation of ethics rules because it will have a broad effect across health-care industries, ethics experts said. The remaining 174 representatives who voted for the AHCA did not own any shares in health-care companies, The Daily Beast’s review found. The most recent data is from 2015. Disclosure reports for 2016 were due last week and are not yet fully available. “As an objective matter, it seems like an awful lot of money in one industry that has a lot of regulation and that these members are directly dealing with legislation on,” said Larry Noble, a former Federal Elections Commission lawyer who now works for the Campaign Legal Center. The tens of millions in investments are far from illegal, said Richard Painter, the lead ethics lawyer in George W. Bush’s White House, but raise conflict of interest concerns. “Knowing that health care is so sensitive, and that one of the core issues in the debate is how much money is going to the companies and how much is going to patient care, I think this shows lack of sensitivity by members of Congress to be going and investing heavily into these companies,” Painter told The Daily Beast. “I think they’re arrogant and they don’t understand that the public is sick and tired of this problem.” Among the influential members with significant investments is Rep. Thomas MacArthur of New Jersey, who held between $834,000 and $2.3 million in health-care company investments in 2015. MacArthur made between $142,000 and $472,000 in capital gains and dividends on those investments, according to his disclosure forms. MacArthur authored an amendment to the AHCA that allows insurance companies to deny coverage to some people with pre-existing conditions. The amendment won over critical support from the right-wing Freedom Caucus, allowing the bill to narrowly pass the House. MacArthur ranks seventh among the 40 AHCA supporters who owned the most health-care stock. Rep. Chris Collins of New York holds the most investments, with $6.5 million in stock in two medical-device companies, ZeptoMetrix and Audubon Machinery Corp. Collins serves as a director at ZeptoMetrix and is one of the founders of Audubon Machinery. (The Office of Government Ethics is investigating Collins’ investments in an Australian pharmaceutical company.) The New York congressman was responsible for an amendment in the AHCA that requires states to pay more into Medicaid at the expense of counties, saving rural areas like his native Buffalo millions of dollars.

Claudia Tenney of New York announced her support in March. Another influential Republican with significant investments is Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan, who holds between $400,000 and $700,000 in health-care shares. Upton wrote an amendment providing up to $8 billion for states to fund “high-risk pools” for patients with pre-existing conditions. Upton’s amendment eased fears that MacArthur’s amendment would make it impossible for such patients to buy insurance. The $8 billion Upton proposed won’t be nearly enough to pay for all the necessary care, industry analysts say, but it was enough to push the AHCA over the finish line. Besides MacArthur, Collins, and Upton, the other lawmakers with at least $500,000 in health-care company shares are: Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas (at least $6 million); Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey (at least $2.2 million); Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin (at least $2.1 million); Rep. Keith Rothfus of Pennsylvania (at least $1.2 million); Rep. Kenny Marchant of Texas (at least $922,000); Rep. James Renacci of Pennsylvania (at least $663,000); and Rep. Rod Blum of Iowa (at least $531,000). Eighteen pro-AHCA representatives held at least $10,000 in health-care investments in 2015; the remaining 12 held at least a single dollar’s worth of investments. Staff of several of the representatives did not reply to questions for this story. Camille Gallo, spokesperson for Rep. MacArthur, provided the following statement: “Congressman MacArthur has divested from all holdings in companies that are affected by his committee appointments. This is not required, nor was he asked to do so. Anyone who is alleging that Tom entered public service to make money is embarrassing themselves and needs to find a new witch to hunt.” Gallo did not say whether MacArthur has consulted ethics officials regarding his significant health-care investments and large role in the AHCA, something both Noble and Painter say should occur for all members of Congress who are doing more than simply voting on legislation. A spokesperson for McCaul said that the congressman “has zero participation or knowledge of the transactions” made as part of his millions of dollars in health-care investments, which are held mostly in family trusts controlled by McCaul’s wife, who is the daughter of the billionaire head of Clear Channel Communications. “He is legally precluded from having any involvement or knowledge of the specific investment decisions made with regard to securities listed as his wife’s separate property, which are disclosed in his annual personal financial disclosure,” spokesperson Lizzie Litzow said of McCaul. Spokespeople for Renacci and Upton said their investments are similarly controlled as part of family trusts or managed portfolios. A spokesperson for Sensenbrenner said his investments are “irrelevant to his vote to repeal and replace Obamacare, a disastrous law that he has opposed since it was signed into law—long before specific details of its replacement were released.” A spokesperson for Rothfus said his vote on the AHCA and other bills are “wholly compliant with the requirements of House ethics rules.” Michael Kracker, a spokesperson for Collins, blamed “partisan attacks” for scrutiny of his investments. “Congressman Collins has followed all congressional ethical guidelines related to his personal finances during his time in the House and will continue to do so,” Kracker said in a statement. Spokespersons for Frelinghuysen, Blum, and Marchant did not respond to requests for comment. Members of Congress aren’t expressly prohibited from owning stocks in individual companies, Painter said, unlike employees of federal agencies and members of the Executive Branch. As a White House ethics lawyer, Painter said he routinely advised aides and other employees of the Executive Branch to either completely divest from investments in individual companies or shift their assets to diversified mutual funds in order to comply with ethics rules. “I don’t understand why members of Congress don’t do that,” Painter said. “The bottom line is that these folks are supposed to be in Congress to represent their constituents, not maximize their wealth. It’s fine if you want to be a stock picker, but go be a stock picker, not a member of Congress.” —with additional reporting by Sarah Bertness READ THIS LIST Pro-Trumpcare Republicans Had Millions in Health-Care Stock Justin Glawe Politics Entertainment World News U.S. News Tech Arts and Culture Drink and Food About Advertise Contact Jobs Help Privacy Code of Ethics & Standards Terms & Conditions Copyright & Trademark Sitemap © 2017 The Daily Beast Company LLC

We like this definition. StayWell experience indicates that a strong culture is better than financial rewards in achieving long-term behavior change from well-being programs Yardley, PA (PRWEB) May 24, 2017 If you’re trying to inspire meaningful, lasting behavior change in your organization, cash rewards might not be the solution, according to a new Incentives Guide from The StayWell Company. The new report from the leading health solutions company examines national trends and pulls from StayWell’s expertise in the research, design, and implementation of behavior change programs to explore both how employers are currently using incentives and how they could use them more effectively. According to the guide, “The Changing Tide of Health Care & Wellness Incentives,” while offering financial rewards can drive participation in transactional activities like completing a health assessment, lasting behavior change is far more likely to occur in a workplace culture that aspires to make healthy choices the norm. StayWell experts illustrate in the guide that if employees change behavior only to get a reward, they are very likely to revert to their old ways once the reward is removed. “Incentives play a helpful role in a comprehensive workplace well-being program, but we’ve learned a lot over the years about using incentives more judiciously to benefit both participants and employers,” said StayWell co-founder and adviser David Anderson, Ph.D. “Our new incentive guide offers insights on best practices for implementing an incentive strategy that fits with organizational culture, health goals, and employee values, while also aligning with current health reform regulations.” The report offers pros and cons of common incentive approaches and easy action steps employers can take to effectively integrate incentives into well-being programs. Highlights include: Creating a workplace culture that supports well-being and healthy choices, Changing the conversation with employees to focus on lasting behavior change, Understanding what motivates employees to guide the design of incentives, Why progress-based incentives may be a better choice than outcomes-based incentives, and The importance of aligning an incentive strategy with an organization’s employee health goals.

The Food and Drug Administration recently gave accelerated approval for Keytruda, a pre-existing drug from Merck, for use on patients diagnosed with solid tumors containing a specific biomarker. Rather than basing treatment on where the mutation originated, Keytruda will be used to treat microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) cancers, those that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) and are otherwise not able to be surgically removed. These types of tumors affect how the DNA is repaired inside the cell. The FDA says those are typically found in colorectal, endometrial and gastrointestinal cancers, but bladder, breast and thyroid cancers can have the markers as well. However, the Administration is quick to note that only five percent of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer have the markers. How's it all work? Keytruda blocks a protein pathway in an effort to help the immune system to fight the cancer. Like many prescription drugs though, there are plenty of side-effects. Most concerning are colitis, hepatitis and pneumonitis -- inflammation of the colon, liver and lungs, respectively. The FDA's priority review designation means that the regulatory body will fast-track its inquiry and hopefully "take action" within six months. Unlike previous types of personal cancer treatment we've covered, this looks to be the most traditional. It doesn't use IBM's supercomputer to find the best care, nor does it involve injecting hydrogels into a patient, and seems the most traditional of anything we've seen thus far. That might explain why the FDA fast-tracked it, actually.

By HealthDay News   |   May 24, 2017 at 12:48 PM Follow @upi Comments WEDNESDAY, May 24, 2017 -- Many new cancer drugs target genetic "biomarkers" that are specific to tumors -- wherever in the body they may appear. So on Tuesday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced that, for the first time, it had approved a cancer drug based on disease genetics rather than the body part where the cancer originated. The drug, Keytruda (pembrolizumab), is targeted to what are called "mismatch repair genes," and its approval means it can be used to fight tumors with these genes wherever they appear -- in the colon, pancreas, stomach, ovaries or other body sites. "This is an important first for the cancer community," Dr. Richard Pazdur, acting director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in an agency news release. "Until now, the FDA has approved cancer treatments based on where in the body the cancer started -- for example, lung or breast cancers," said Pazdur, who also directs the FDA's Oncology Center of Excellence. "We have now approved a drug based on a tumor's biomarker without regard to the tumor's original location." Keytruda, made by Merck & Co., targets tumors with DNA known as microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). As the FDA explained, these gene abnormalities affect repair mechanisms inside the cell. "Tumors with these biomarkers are most commonly found in colorectal, endometrial and gastrointestinal cancers, but also less commonly appear in cancers arising in the breast, prostate, bladder, thyroid gland and other places," the FDA said in the news release. "Approximately 5 percent of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer have MSI-H or dMMR tumors." Keytruda works by targeting a cellular pathway that helps the body's own immune system attack the cancer cells. The drug had previously received separate approval for a variety of tumor types, such as metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic melanoma, and other cancers. That approval has been widened and Keytruda is now allowed for the treatment of adults and children with certain tumors that can't be surgically removed, or solid tumors that have spread. The FDA said the drug is approved for use in two kinds of patients: Those who don't have alternatives after tumors have progressed after treatment; and those with colorectal cancer that's progressed after treatment with certain chemotherapy drugs. The FDA said 149 patients with tumors with the biological variations -- 15 tumor types in all -- took part in five separate studies that led to the new approval. Tumors responded by either completely or partially shrinking in 40 percent of the patients. The findings also showed that more than three-quarters of those patients had a response for at least six months. The drug has many side effects, including some that are serious -- such as inflammation of healthy organs -- so patients who experience those complications should stop taking the drug. Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding should not take the drug. More information There's more on Keytruda at Cancer Research UK. Copyright © 2017 HealthDay. All rights reserved.

On Tuesday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it had approved Keytruda, an immunotherapy, for patients who have genetic glitches in so-called “mismatch repair” genes. Mutations in these genes mean their cells don’t fully repair errors in DNA. That can trigger cancer, but it also makes their tumors particularly susceptible to drugs like Keytruda, which is marketed by Merck. In a statement, Richard Pazdur, acting director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, called the approval “an important first for the cancer community.” How greatly will precision medicine change cancer treatment? Share your thoughts. Precision medicine is the idea that medical treatments should be personalized to an individual’s genetic makeup, or other information about them. But up until now, cancer therapies have all been approved to treat cancer based on where it is located, such as in the breast or lung. Keytruda is the first that can be given to anyone who harbors one of two relatively rare genetic abnormalities, and is suffering from a solid tumor, such as pancreatic or lung cancer. Olivier Lesueur, managing partner at Bionest Partners, a consulting firm, calls the approval a “breakthrough in the way we see and define cancer.” Keytruda works by unleashing the body’s immune system to attack tumors, and was first approved to treat advanced skin cancer in 2014. Such drugs, called checkpoint inhibitors, have had remarkable success, including saving the life of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter. The downside of immunotherapy is that not all patients seem to benefit, for reasons that remain uncertain.

Incorrect email format Manage your newsletter preferences With the new approval, the number of patients expected to benefit could grow substantially. About 4 percent of all advanced cancers—up to 30,000 patients a year in the U.S.—harbor the genetic abnormalities that Keytruda can treat, says Dung Le, oncologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute for Immunotherapy. “This drug is going to reach patients we would not have offered the therapy to before,” says Le. The new approval only applies to patients for whom traditional treatment, like chemotherapy, has already failed. But genetic tests to identify patients with mismatch repair genes are widely available and cost $300 to $600, says Le. Keytruda itself costs around $150,000 a year.

Curiosity May Be Vital for Truly Smart AI Merck won a so-called “accelerated” approval based on a clinical trial involving just 149 patients with 15 different types of cancers at Johns Hopkins and four other hospitals. In the trial, about 40 percent of patients experienced complete or partial shrinkage of their tumors. One of those patients is Adrienne Skinner, 60, of Larchmont, New York, who endured surgery and a year of chemotherapy after being diagnosed in 2013 with advanced ampullary cancer, a rare and deadly gastrointestinal cancer. In April 2014, Skinner joined the Keytruda study. She was a candidate because she was born with Lynch syndrome, an inherited condition in which her DNA repair genes don’t work correctly. After just a few months on the drug, a surgeon examined her and told Skinner her tumor had disappeared. Skinner continued on the drug for another two years and says she now feels like her normal self again. She works full-time, goes to the gym most days, plays tennis, and does yoga. If not for the drug, she says, “I’d be dead by now.”  Cut off? Read unlimited articles today. Become an Insider Already an Insider? Log in.

The US FDA filing acceptance follows the acceptance of the regulatory filing of tildrakizumab by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in March 2017. Tildrakizumab is an investigational IL-23p19 inhibitor being evaluated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.  In 2014, Sun Pharma acquired worldwide rights to tildrakizumab from Merck, known as MSD outside the US and Canada. Funded by a Sun Pharma subsidiary, Merck is responsible for the completion of phase 3 trials in patients with mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis and, as appropriate, submission of a biologics license application to the US FDA.  Merck is also responsible for manufacturing finished goods to support Sun Pharma’s initial product launch. Post-approval in the US, Sun Pharma will be responsible for all other regulatory activities, including subsequent submissions, pharmacovigilance, post approval studies, manufacturing and commercialisation of the approved product. Merck is eligible to receive milestone payments and royalties on sales of tildrakizumab.  Abhay Gandhi, CEO - North America Business, Sun Pharma, said, “At Sun Dermatology, we are committed to making a difference in the lives of patients and healthcare providers. The acceptance of the regulatory filing by the US FDA marks a significant milestone as we seek to advance for tildrakizumab as a potential new treatment option for people who continue to struggle everyday with the chronic nature of psoriasis.” For European market, Sun Pharma has a licensing agreement with Almirall for the development and commercialisation of tildrakizumab for psoriasis. Under terms of the license agreement, Almirall is able to lead European studies, and participate in larger global clinical studies for psoriasis indication. The agreement between Sun Pharma and Almirall remains subject to the exclusive license agreement between Sun Pharma and Merck. Psoriasis, a chronic immune disease that appears on the skin, affects an estimated 7.5 million people in the US and approximately 125 million people worldwide. The most common form of psoriasis, called plaque psoriasis, appears as red, raised areas of skin covered with flaky white scales, which may be itchy and painful and can crack and bleed.

Vaccination protects animals from specific infectious diseases and may be carried out either routinely or potentially in an emergency. Vaccination of animals used for food can also help protect consumers against zoonotic pathogens such as salmonella. Request a sample of this report @ http://www.orbisresearch.com/contacts/request-sample/292959 . Veterinary vaccine market in Europe is as old as the concept itself and newest products are significantly available throughout the market. The farmers and animal husbandry owners seem well versed with the idea of animal vaccination. But the real test lies in the stringent guidelines for animal vaccines testing as per EU regulations. This prevents or at least hardens the route for new players to enter the market. Also the market has undergone considerable progress during the past few years with the growing usage of continuous cell lines as a substrate and embracing of the fermenter technology for antigen production. These vaccines are produced for administration by parenteral or oral routes depending on the vaccine characteristics. Growing prevalence of animal diseases, rising incidences of zoonotic diseases in humans; increasing investments by leading players, various government agencies and animal associations; continuous innovations, increasing awareness against the use of antimicrobials is driving the vaccine producers to invest significantly into development of new products. However, rising maintenance costs for the storage of vaccines, increasing adoption of vegetarian diet in major economies owing to increasing risk of obesity and other chronic diseases are key restraints of this market.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Pulmonary Drugs Market Research Report- Forecast to 2024 Global Pulmonary Drugs Market: Snapshot The global pulmonary drugs market has been the key area of focus and the most crucial market for the healthcare industry in the last couple of years. However, the market is expected to witness a significant decline over the forecast period with a -6.3% CAGR from 2016 to 2024. The market is anticipated to fall to US$28,082.1 mn from a valuation of US$48,039.7 mn in 2015. Keeping aside the tremendous fall of the global pulmonary drugs market, it has been expected that the market will find growth prospects from the growing number of respiratory diseases and the fact that they are becoming the leading cause of deaths across the globe at present, especially among the aged population. Get accurate market forecast and analysis on the Pulmonary Drugs Market. Request a sample to stay abreast on the key trends impacting this market. www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… According to the Forum of International Respiratory Societies (FIRS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease affects over 200 million people across the globe and is also one of the leading causes of death globally. On the other, over 235 million people across the globe suffer from asthma. Owing to these alarming statistics, the consumption of pulmonary drugs is likely to gain momentum, thus providing growth opportunities to the market in spite of the negative CAGR. Pulmonary drugs are also being employed for the treatment of conditions such as cystic fibrosis, respiration-related disorders, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and allergic rhinitis. The launch of many effective and innovative drugs in the global market for pulmonary drugs is also anticipated to have a positive impact on the growth of the market in the coming years. Medical Professionals to Prefer Combination Drugs among All Others Based on drug classes, the global market for pulmonary drugs is classified into combination drugs, anticholinergics, short acting beta2-agonists, vasodilators, antihistamines, long-acting beta2-agonists, and inhaled corticosteroids, and others such as antileukotrienes, antibiotics, enzymes, and monoclonal antibodies. Among these, the segment of combination drugs held the leading share of 27.4% in 2015 closely followed by inhaled corticosteroids with a share of 16.7% in the same year in the global pulmonary drugs market. The sales of combination drugs is likely to remain high throughout the forecast period as they are considered to be comparatively safer than the other drugs. Moreover, the advent of triple combination drugs is further projected to propel the growth of the global pulmonary drugs market over the course of the forecast period. Advent of Middle-income Classes to Catapult Demand in Asia Pacific Based on geography, the global market for pulmonary drugs has been classified into Asia Pacific, North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and Latin America. In 2015, North America led the global pulmonary drugs market with a share of 41% with Europe closely following with a share of 32.4% in the same year. The growing use of pulmonary drugs in these regions can be attributed to the advanced healthcare infrastructure coupled with high awareness regarding treatment of pulmonary diseases. However, the rise of middle-income classes and their growing expenditure on healthcare is expected to lift Asia Pacific as a prominent region in the global market. Some of the leading players in the market are Actelion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Merck & Co., Inc, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., GlaxoSmithKline plc, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Bayer AG, Novartis AG, AstraZeneca plc, and Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print What to watch in today's CBO score By Dan Diamond 05/24/2017 10:00 AM EDT IT'S CBO SCORE DAY — And Washington is bracing for the verdict, which is expected this afternoon and poised to shape the GOP's health care legislation and Democrats' reaction. One of the most-awaited scores ever? Today's estimate of the amended American Health Care Act is extra-important because of its legislative consequences. Specifically: Story Continued Below 1) It'll serve as the unofficial framework for Senate GOP lawmakers negotiating their own version of repeal and will likely help those eager to make big changes. 2) There's a chance — albeit a small one — that the revised House bill won't match the savings targets required by the Senate. In that case, GOP leaders will be forced to tinker with the bill in the House and vote again … a worst-case scenario for many moderate Republicans who hoped they were done with the controversial bill and bear scars from the brutal fight to get the legislation through the first time. (While rushing so quickly that they didn't wait for a CBO score in the first place.) 3) Today's forecast is also expected to become a rallying point for progressives critical of an effort that could strip health care from millions. Forecast: Big coverage losses loom. “I would be shocked if we didn’t wind up with a CBO score that showed more than 20 million people lose insurance,” Doug Holtz-Eakin, who served as CBO director during George W. Bush’s administration, told POLITICO's Adam Cancryn and Sarah Ferris. Keep reading: More for Pros. Meanwhile, opponents of the AHCA are seizing on today's score to ramp up their messaging. — AARP pushing out new ad buy. The seven-figure campaign targets the "age tax" in House Republicans' health bill and will be airing in markets served by Sens. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), Dean Heller (R-Nev.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska). Flake, Heller and Murkowski have all raised questions about the legislation. "AARP is taking a strong stand against the American Health Care Act for one simple reason: it is a bad bill," said AARP's Nancy LeaMond in a statement. "On behalf of our 38 million members, we are urging Senators to scrap the AHCA and start over." Watch the ads. — American Bridge zings what Trumpcare 'covers'. The liberal PAC is also out with a satirical Web video that says Republicans' health bill covers "foot-in-mouth disease" — showing video of President Trump's misstatements — but won't cover health care for many working families. Watch the video. TRUMP’S FDA BUDGET UNDERCUTS AGENCY SAFETY EFFORTS — The White House budget blueprint for FDA would reduce the staff devoted to medical product safety while cutting “critical investments” in research and “essential training” for employees, according to a report on the proposal released Tuesday by FDA. The plan relies on an almost 70 percent boost in industry user fees, which almost certainly isn’t going to happen, at the expense of a 30 percent cut to taxpayer funding. And the industry dollars mainly fund product reviews, not the agency’s broader public health and regulatory mission. … FDA said in a report to congressional appropriators that the budget would "reduce staff across medical product safety programs through attrition," though it promised a risk-based approach to its consumer protection efforts and pledged to mitigate the impact, Pro's Brett Norman and Sarah Karlin-Smith report. The proposal almost certainly won’t become law. Top lawmakers in Congress have already said that the five-year user fee agreements — which must be enacted by Oct. 1 — will not be renegotiated before then. But FDA advocates were troubled by the White House desire to further shift agency funding to the industry. "The real practical problem here is that [the White House is] taking appropriations away and replacing it with something that's not going to happen, and what we're left with, is the taking away and a significant hole in the agency's budget," said Ladd Wiley, executive director of the Alliance for a Stronger FDA.

According to the Federation of American Hospitals' list, the legislation under consideration in the Senate should include sustained support for the ACA's Medicaid expansion and cost-sharing reduction payments but also roll back about $300 billion in productivity adjustments for hospitals, among other requests. Read the letter. Deloitte expert on CSRs: 'Market is totally unsettled.' The Trump administration’s decision to seek a 90-day delay in deciding how to proceed with the House’s lawsuit challenging Obamacare subsidies had many insurers expressing concern about the continuing uncertainty for Obamacare markets in 2018. But Greg Scott, who oversees Deloitte’s health plans practice, thinks that might be understating the precarious situation. “I think we’re moving from uncertainty to instability and risky,” Scott told POLITICO's Paul Demko. “I think the market is totally unsettled.” BCBSA huddles with GOP senators — Republicans welcomed a visitor to their Tuesday health care working group meeting: Blue Cross Blue Shield Association CEO Scott Serota, Pro's Adam Cancryn reports. Serota — whose group represents several Blues plans still on the Obamacare exchanges — trekked to the Senate to give a presentation to the lawmakers charged with privately developing a plan for repealing Obamacare, multiple people familiar with the meeting said. EYE ON PHARMA FDA approves first cancer drug based on genetic tumor info. It's a step forward for precision medicine — the first time FDA has approved a drug based on this type of biomarker rather than the location in the body where the tumor originated, Pro's Sarah Karlin-Smith reports. The drug, Merck’s immunotherapy Keytruda, can be used to treat adult and pediatric patients with inoperable or metastatic solid tumors with this genetic marker. “This is an important first for the cancer community,” said FDA's Richard Pazdur. “Until now, the FDA has approved cancer treatments based on where in the body the cancer started — for example, lung or breast cancers. We have now approved a drug based on a tumor’s biomarker without regard to the tumor’s original location.” FDA looked at data on patients enrolled in one of five clinical trials to support the drug’s approval.

Veterinary Vaccines are important and, at times, essential tools for prevention or control of a given animal disease, but they require complementary actions like enabling legislation, investment for diagnostic, early response, public communication etc. The growing demand for livestock products (fuelled by population growth, increased urbanisation and greater purchasing power of individuals in developing or middle- income countries) coupled with the necessity of complying with the standards of trade agreements, mean that governments in the Middle-East & Africa region must improve animal health in their countries. Request a sample of this report @ http://www.orbisresearch.com/contacts/request-sample/292962 . Veterinary vaccine market has shown significant growth in recent years which can be attributed to increasing incidences of animal pandemics in the region.

Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an insect-borne, multi-species zoonotic viral disease of livestock has been exclusively con?ned to the African continent, but it began spreading to Middle-East in the past decade. This marks the estimation of further growth in the market in terms of livestock vaccine sales. However, International and regional collaboration has proven successful in the progressive control of these pandemics, e.g. the work of the Pan American Foot-and-Mouth Disease Centre in South America and the European Union FMD Commission which this region lacks. It makes adoption of regulations that much harder in the area.

The wrong diagnosis and the major effects on the body of the infected person have directly resulted in the diagnosis of Herpes Zoster and development in its drugs. Market Research Hub (MRH) has detailed the pipeline review of the infection in the report „Herpes Zoster (Shingles) – Pipeline Review, H1 2017″ that has been recently added to its massive repository.

Request Free Sample Report: http://www.marketresearchhub.com/enquiry.php?type=S&repid=1068031 Shingles (herpes zoster) is a painful, blistering skin rash caused by the varicella-zoster virus. The various symptoms are headache, joint pain, fever and chills, and swollen glands. Treatment includes antihistamines and pain relievers. Shingles mostly occur when the virus that causes chickenpox starts up again in the body. After a person gets healthier from chickenpox, the virus becomes dormant in the nerve roots; in some cases, it stays dormant forever, in others, the virus „wakes up” when the immune system weakens. Some medicines may also trigger the virus to wake up and cause the infection. The pipeline review starts with the Herpes Zoster (Shingles) overview and the various therapeutic development and assessment that are currently in progress. This pipeline review has been analyzed by companies and products under development by companies. Further, the therapeutic assessment is completed in the research by the target, mechanism of action (MoA), route of administration and molecule type.

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Politics | Wed May 24, 2017 | 5:11pm EDT Exclusive: McConnell expects bipartisan support for bill reauthorizing FDA user fees WASHINGTON U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell told Reuters on Wednesday he expects bipartisan support for approval of a bill authorizing taxpayer and industry funding for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The bill to reauthorize the Prescription Drug User Fee Act would let the FDA continue to collect hundreds of millions of dollars from drugmakers and medical device companies to partially cover the cost of reviewing new products, with U.S. taxpayers funding the remainder. "It's an extremely important bill that I think we'll be able to move on a bipartisan basis," McConnell said in an interview. [L1N1IQ1CH] The FDA has been charging companies to review their products since 1992. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump proposed in his 2018 budget that the industry pay the full cost of drug and medical device reviews. The industry at present pays about 60 percent. That proposal is unlikely to be approved in this cycle. Reauthorization of the user fee bill is typically negotiated between the FDA and industry over a period of several years. Earlier this month, the bill was approved by a Senate panel by a 21-2 vote. It must be renegotiated every five years. The FDA reviews drugs for approval or rejection for many companies, including major ones such as Pfizer Inc, Merck & Co Inc and Johnson and Johnson. Pharmaceutical companies based overseas, including Roche Holding AG and Novartis AG, also pay these fees for U.S.-approved drugs.

Under U.S. Republican bill, 23 million would lose health coverage: watchdog WASHINGTON A bill passed by U.S. House Republicans would cause 23 million people to lose healthcare coverage by 2026 while de-stabilizing health insurance markets in some states and making it hard for sick people to buy insurance, a budget watchdog agency said on Wednesday. Treasury chief says reviewing Iran's aircraft licenses WASHINGTON The U.S. Treasury is reviewing licenses for Boeing Co and Airbus to sell aircraft to Iran, department head Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday, telling lawmakers he would increase sanctions pressure on Iran, Syria and North Korea.

Tildrakizumab is an investigational IL-23p19 inhibitor being evaluated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis,” Sun Pharma said in a regulatory filing. Sun Pharma CEO -North America Business Abhay Gandhi said: “The acceptance of the regulatory filing by the US FDA marks a significant milestone as we seek to advance for tildrakizumab as a potential new treatment option for people who continue to struggle everyday with the chronic nature of psoriasis”. The company said that the BLA filing for tildrakizumab with the US FDA is based on two pivotal Phase III trials which included over 1,800 patients across more than 200 clinical trial sites, including some patients who have been treated with tildrakizumab for up to three-and-a-half years. The BLA filing for tildrakizumab was submitted by Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA, it added. The BLA is a request for permission to introduce, or deliver for introduction, a biologic product into interstate commerce, as per the US FDA.
