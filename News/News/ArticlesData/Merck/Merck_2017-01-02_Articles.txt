Nikkei rises on weak yen but other Asian indexes mixed Associated Press | 0 comments TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares were mixed Wednesday, as the Tokyo benchmark jumped in the first trading of 2017, helped by a weak yen. Other indexes lost some gains from earlier this week. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 added 2.2 percent to 19,536.72, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was little changed at 5,734.80. South Korea's Kospi edged up nearly 0.1 percent to 2,045.13. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dipped 0.2 percent to 22,104.67, while the Shanghai Composite index gained 0.1 percent to 3,139.80. KIMONOS AND CLAPPING: The Tokyo Stock Exchange welcomed the new year in customary style as women in kimono clapped while Finance Minister Taro Aso rang a bell to celebrate this year's first session. The Nikkei surged as much as 400 yen at one point, as the weak yen, a boon for exporters, pushed auto shares including Honda Motor Co. higher. JAPAN MANUFACTURING: Investors were encouraged by Wednesday's release of the Nikkei Japan Manufacturing PMI, a survey of purchasing managers. The reading of 52.4 for December was its highest in a year. The figure is based on a scale of 0 to 100, where 50 marks the shift between contraction and expansion. Manufacturers cited rising orders from the U.S., China and Europe as one factor behind the improvement. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks broke a three-day losing streak, ushering in the new year with broad gains. The Dow Jones industrial average added 119.16 points, or 0.6 percent, to 19,881.76. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 19 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,257.83. The Nasdaq composite gained 45.97 points, or 0.9 percent, to 5,429.08. THE QUOTE: "Strong sentiment at the start of the year coupled with volatility could be what 2017 has in store for the markets," said Jingyi Pan, a market strategist at IG in Singapore. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude added 33 cents to $52.66 a barrel in New York. It lost $1.39 to $52.33 a barrel on Tuesday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 34 cents to $55.81 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar remained strong, rising to 117.97 yen from 117.39 yen. The euro slumped to $1.0404 from $1.0481. ___ Follow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama Her work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama © 2017 The Associated Press.

Among 5,837 people who received the rVSV-EBOV vaccine in the trial in Guinea in 2015, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination, signalling 100 percent protection. More than 11,300 people died in West Africa's 2013-2016 epidemic of the virus, which causes hemorrhagic fever. "When the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless," said Marie-Paule Kieny, a World Health Organisation (WHO) assistant director-general and one of the lead researchers in the trial. Merck's rVSV-EBOV has already been used in Sierra Leone to contain a flare-up there. The Guinea trial took place in the coastal region of Basse-Guinée, which was still seeing new Ebola cases when the trial started in 2015. It used a "ring vaccination" approach, in which, when a new Ebola case was diagnosed, researchers traced all people who might have been in recent contact and logged them as clusters, or "rings", made up of an average of 80 people. At first, the clusters were assigned to receive the vaccine either immediately or after a three-week delay. After interim results showed 100 percent protection in those vaccinated immediately, the trial design was switched to allow all clusters to be given the shot straight away. The WHO said that if Ebola outbreaks occurred before the vaccine was given full regulatory approval, it could be made available though a compassionate use procedure after informed consent. John Edmunds, a professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, whose team helped design the trial, hailed its success as "historic". "When Ebola strikes again we will be in a much better position to offer help to affected communities, as well as protect the brave volunteers who help control this terrible disease," he said in an emailed statement. GAVI, the global vaccine alliance, provided $5 million earlier this year to buy 300,000 doses of rVSV-EBOV as a stockpile for use during future Ebola outbreaks.

December 20th 2016 a month ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/ Scientists predict that we are on the cusp of the fourth industrial revolution as artificial intelligence, robotics, synthetics and the internet of things change the way we do things. Picture: iStock Sue DunlevyNews Corp Australia Network Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend EXCLUSIVE AN implantable mobile phone that will diagnose your illnesses and connect you to the internet and a drug that can improve your learning and memory will be on the horizon in 2017. And look out for the new wide view bionic eye that is now in trials and, unlike the prototype that needed an external plug, it is fully implantable and portable. Human trials of a revolutionary device called a nanopatch that has eliminated the need for a needle in immunisation are currently underway and are expected to report in 2017. An app that will help vision impaired people, and others, navigate shopping centres, find toilets and fire exits and other public places is in development. A smart watch that will help kids with autism manage their daily routines is due to be launched mid to late next year. And new treatments that attack the cancer stem cells which survive radiotherapy and chemotherapy will be trialled. Scientists predict that we are on the cusp of the fourth industrial revolution as artificial intelligence, robotics, synthetics and the internet of things change the way we do things and Australian researchers are at the helm. First mechanisation and steam transformed our lives, then electricity, recently it was digitalisation and the internet, the next revolution will be about artificial intelligence, robotics and the internet of things. University of Queensland’s Professor Mark Kendall’s needle free vaccine delivery invention — the Nanopatch — is poised to take the fear out of immunisation and remove the need for vaccines to be refrigerated. And it could slash the price of vaccination one hundredfold because using the skin to prompt an immune response is more efficient and requires less vaccine. Professor Mark Kendall pictured with his Nanopatch needle-free vaccine device in his lab at the University of Queensland. Picture: Tim MarsdenSource:News Corp Australia The cervical cancer vaccine invented by another Australian Professor Ian Frazer costs $50 to make but if it could be delivered via the nanopatch it would cost just 50 cents making it accessible to the global population, says Professor Kendall. Reports on outcomes of the first human trials of the nanopatch are expected next year. The one centimetre square of silicone, studded with 20,000 vaccine coated micro projections that perforate the skin activates immune cells immediately below the skin. Tests on mice showed the device increased the immune response in rodents and could mean less vaccine was needed. Australian Venture capital company Vaxxas has partnered with pharmaceutical company Merck, a major vaccine manufacturer and is currently conducting the first trails of the patch on humans in Brisbane. Late next year further trials of the patch in conjunction with the World Health Organisation will test its success in delivering the Polio vaccine in Cuba. But for Professor Kendall the nanopatch is just the start. He attended a World Economic Forum meeting in Davos this year where there was talk of an implantable mobile phone. The idea has mesmerised the Australian scientist and he wants to be involved. “Being a futurist is a tricky business but it is very easy to visualise an implantable you don’t see serving the full function of a mobile phone, detecting key biomarkers in the body that can have a huge impact on personalised medicine,” he says. Professor Mark Kendall pictured with his Nanopatch needle-free vaccine device in his lab at the University of Queensland. Picture: Tim MarsdenSource:News Corp Australia At the moment medicines are trialled and delivered based on what is known to work on the average person but within the next ten years Kendall believes we will be able to practice bespoke medicine. We’ll be able to detect what happens in each individual’s body and tailor the therapy on an individual level. That’s where the implantable mobile phone comes in, it will be able to check biomarkers in the body to tell how you are responding to treatments, it will pick up the first signs of illness and, just like your pedometer interfaces with your computer tracking your activity, the new device will too alert your doctors to emerging illnesses or adverse events from your medicine. “I believe we can make a contribution in that space,” Professor Kendall says. In Adelaide biopharmaceutical company Bionomics is on the threshold of what could be the next blockbuster drug, a treatment that improves cognition and memory. The BNC375 treatment targets the alpha 7 receptor in the brain, spleen and lymphocytes of lymph nodes, it is critical for memory, working memory, learning and attention. Bionomics has won a $506 million deal with pharmaceutical company Merck for research on the treatment and the first human clinical trial is imminent. Bionomics CEO Deborah Rathgen says the treatment might be useful in Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, ADHD and Alzheimer’s disease. This is important because recently a promising Alzheimer’s treatment that targeted the beta amyloid plaques that accumulate between nerve cells in the brain fell over with trials showing it was no better than a placebo. However, BCN375’s importance extends way beyond treating the disease that is now Australia’s second biggest killer. Scientists are changing modern medicine everyday. Picture: iStockSource:Supplied “We’ve done tests in mice and primates that showed in various settings where cognition was impaired or declined in aged animals or induced memory loss and BCN375 can restore memory quite dramatically,” Ms Rathgen says. “There is natural decline in memory as people age and if we have a drug that is safe and effective you can think more broadly than Alzheimer’s disease,” she says. To test the treatment mice were given the novel object recognition test. They were given one object to explore and then introduced to a new object, if they had diminishing memory they continued to explore the old object because they could not remember it, primates also played memory games on the computer to test if the drug worked. The first human trials will use healthy volunteers to see if the drug improves their memory. Rathgen says its “pretty terrific” the treatment has been developed in Australia and when you consider they key Alzheimer’s treatment today has sales of over $4 billion a year, if BNC375 works it will be a money spinner. Bionomics is also working on two other treatments, an anxiety therapy called BNC210 that is being trialled on people suffering Post Traumatic Stress Disorder in Australia. It has another treatment BNC101 that attacks cancer stem cells that are resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, that is currently in clinical trials in Australia on people with metastatic colon cancer. The bionic eye was one of the standout ideas from former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd’s 2020 Summit and its development is proceeding apace. A basic device that required a person to be hooked up to a desktop computer showed promise and in 2017 trials will begin on a second generation device that is portable and have double the number of electrodes. In the new device electrode arrays will be implanted between the two back layers of the eye using surgery. The idea is it will help people with poor sight identify shapes, perceive movement, and undertake unassisted navigation tasks. The original device required an external plug to connect electrodes to lab equipment, the new device will be fully implantable and portable. The bionic eye which is being developed in Australia. Picture: News Corp AustraliaSource:News Limited The first trial conducted by Bionic Vision Australia commenced in 2012 and involved the implant of a 24-electrodes, the new device has 44 electrodes. Another device that will help the visually impaired is AudiBle — an app that will allow people to find public toilets, fire exits and other places in shopping centres and other public places. Chartered Accountant Anna Wright, who is visually impaired herself, says current GPS systems are not that useful because they are only accurate to within 5-7 metres outside and worse inside a building “and that still means you could get hit by a bus”. To develop her idea she has been awarded $100,000 by SheStarts an initiative to kick start new technologies developed by women supported by the, ANZ, MYOB, GSK, Sunsuper and the University Technology Sydney. The idea is to use tiny beacons installed in public buildings and Radio Frequency identification tags (similar to a bar code) to direct people to public toilets and other places inside building. The technology will be linked to smart phones and voice operated and will speak to people directing them to where they want to go. If you are male it will be programmed to automatically direct you to the male toilet. “They leave braille on buildings now but blind people don’t know it’s there,” says Ms Wright. The technology will be trialled at the Unversity of Technology in Sydney next year. Another technology sponsored by SheStarts is Habot, a smart watch to help children with autism complete their morning and evening routines, remember after school activities, and bringing home readers and assignments. The developers of the technology Alex Armitage and Michelle Hughes say children with autism often lack self-regulation skills and they and their parents get stressed which can make the child suffering extreme anxiety and unable to perform to their full potential. Using Habot parents will be able to create and manage their child’s detailed routines for weekdays and weekends that provide visual, vibratory and auditory prompts (preference selectable) and targets, and also tracks achievements and rewards. The 15,000 Australians currently paralysed by spinal cord injuries will get a boon next year courtesy of a $3 million donation from the Neilson Foundation to establish an Australian arm of a program using spinal neuromodulation to help paraplegics and quadriplegics regain movement. The program at the University of Technology Sydney will involve Professor Reggie Edgerton of UCLA in California the pioneer of spinal neuromodulationand will be the first time such a program has been established outside of the USA.

By the time it was diagnosed, the medicine, ivermectin, wasn’t able to save him. Fred Lum/The Globe and Mail Kelly Grant HEALTH REPORTER The Globe and Mail Last updated: Tuesday, Jan. 03, 2017 7:26AM EST Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Comments When an Alberta man mysteriously fell ill in the fall, it took a team of doctors and a biopsy of the patient’s muscle tissue to discover the cause: sarcocystosis, a rare parasitic infection. The patient’s doctors wanted to treat him with albendazole, a common anti-worm pill that has been used safely around the globe for more than 20 years, and which is on the World Health Organization’s list of essential medicines. But albendazole is not available in Canada. A Health Canada program that allows seriously ill patients to obtain unlicensed drugs – known as the Special Access Programme (SAP) – turned down the doctors’ request. So Stan Houston, a University of Alberta professor of medicine and public health who was in Zimbabwe for work, walked into a private pharmacy in the southern African country, plunked down $60 (U.S.) and brought home in his suitcase a 14-day course of albendazole for the patient, who was being treated by some of Dr. Houston’s medical colleagues. “I’m not quite sure of the legality, but I’m totally comfortable with the ethics of it,” Dr. Houston said. “The bottom line is that, after immense thought and effort and investigation, real experts thought this was the best thing to do … and SAP said no.” Albendazole is one of a handful of older, world-beating medications that tropical-medicine doctors and infectious-disease specialists say are badly needed in Canada, but that cannot be prescribed because no pharmaceutical company has stepped up to license them here. The problem is not the safety or efficacy of these drugs. It’s the size of the Canadian market. Drug makers cannot wring a profit from pills that only a few hundred migrants and travellers take every year. Health Canada’s solution to this problem has been to funnel requests for older drugs such as albendazole through SAP, the same route terminally ill patients take to access new, cutting-edge treatments not yet licensed in Canada. But doctors say SAP can be opaque, arbitrary and slow, and that its rules sometimes keep the best drugs out of the hands of Canadians who need them. To qualify, patients must have a “serious” or “life-threatening” illness for which there is no other treatment on the market, forcing people who are sick but not dying to settle for second-rate drugs. Health Canada officials are reluctant to expand SAP’s mandate or to allow the stockpiling of more special-access drugs in major centres, as they already do with two intravenous therapies for severe malaria. If Health Canada stretches the rules too far, it risks opening a back door that could allow pharmaceutical companies to bypass the Health Canada drug-approval process altogether. “It is a bit of a uniquely Canadian, self-inflicted thing,” said Adam Houston, a lawyer and PhD candidate at the University of Ottawa who is working on a research paper about the Special Access Programme with three co-authors, including his father, the same Dr. Houston who brought albendazole home in his suitcase. “A small number of people need these drugs. To make sure there’s some kind of access, we’ve shoehorned them into SAP, even though SAP is very, very clearly not designed for Nobel Prize-winning drugs that were invented 40 years ago.” The Nobel Prize-winning drug to which Mr. Houston is referring is ivermectin, a parasite-killing therapy that has dramatically reduced the incidence of onchocerciasis, or river blindness, in the developing world. Ivermectin cures a host of diseases caused by parasitic worms, including strongyloidiasis, the infection for which it is most often needed in Canada. Strongyloides are microscopic roundworms that people can pick up while walking barefoot in sand or soil in most tropical regions. The worms penetrate the skin and settle in the bowel, where, in about half of all cases, they lie dormant for years without causing any symptoms. But if a person’s immune system is suppressed with chemotherapy, steroids or other drugs, the worm’s larvae can escape the bowel and spread throughout the body, causing disseminated strongyloidiasis, an infection that is lethal in 90 per cent of cases. Ivermectin cures strongyloidiasis – if the infection is caught in time. It wasn’t in the case of Alberto Ceccarelli. Mr. Ceccarelli, a retired baggage handler for Air Canada, was a father of two who loved hunting and prided himself on his ability to fix anything. He was in the midst of single-handedly repairing his flood-damaged Etobicoke basement when he started suffering persistent diarrhea and weight loss about three years ago, his daughter, Tracey Ceccarelli, said. Mr. Ceccarelli went to the hospital, where the doctors who misdiagnosed him with ulcerative colitis treated him with steroids and anti-inflammatory medicines, unwittingly awakening the strongyloides he had no idea were in his bowel. “Five days later, that’s when all hell broke loose,” Ms. Ceccarelli said. “It was literally four months of infection after infection.” After a heart attack, stroke, meningitis and stints in four different hospitals, a doctor finally tested him for strongyloides in August of 2014. He died a week later at the age of 67. Andrea Boggild, a tropical-medicine specialist at Toronto General Hospital who has been helping Mr. Ceccarelli’s family raise awareness of the disease, said the widespread infection was discovered too late for oral ivermectin to have saved him, even if the medications had been readily available. But Dr. Boggild said Mr. Ceccarelli’s case underlines the need for swift access to ivermectin and albendazole, which she uses in combination to treat strongyloidiasis. Ivermectin cures strongyloidiasis – if the infection is caught in time. It wasn’t in the case of Alberto Ceccarelli. Family photo “If you’ve got a patient in the ICU and they’ve got gram-negative sepsis or gram-negative meningitis and all of sudden someone thinks, ‘Wait a second, maybe we should test for strongyloidiasis’ and, lo and behold, they’re pumping out larvae, you can see how a six-day turnaround time is unacceptable,” Dr. Boggild said. Supriya Sharma, Health Canada’s Chief Medical Officer, said the Special Access Programme makes “every effort” to respond to requests within 24 hours. The program has someone on call 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year, she said. Many of the doctors interviewed for this story also said they have seen requests for ivermectin for strongyloidiasis approved within a day or two. The drug is frequently requested and the infection clearly meets SAP’s guidelines. What is the Special Access Programme? Health Canada’s Special Access Programme (SAP) allows doctors to obtain unlicensed drugs for individual patients battling “serious” or “life-threatening” illnesses, so long as there are not alternative treatments already on the market in Canada. Physicians can apply through SAP for cutting-edge drugs that are not yet licensed here, or for long-established medications that pharmaceutical companies won’t sell in Canada’s small market. With a salary budget of about $700,000 per year and the equivalent of nine full-time employees, the SAP issued more than 14,000 authorizations for access to unapproved drugs in 2015. But when Dr. Boggild and a medical student reviewed all of the SAP requests that Toronto General Hospital’s Tropical Disease Unit filed for ivermectin and albendazole between 2013 and 2015, they found the average turnaround times were much longer: nine days in 2013, seven in 2014 and five in 2015. Even in cases of strongyloidiasis hyperinfection, more than five days elapsed between a doctor submitting an SAP request and the Tropical Disease Unit receiving the drug, according to a summary of Dr. Boggild’s review published last month in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. Ms. Ceccarelli tested positive for strongyloides in her system after her father’s death. She wasn’t displaying any symptoms. Doctors do not know where the father and daughter picked up the worms, or even if they picked them up in the same place. The elder Ceccarelli was born in rural Italy and could have acquired strongyloides as a child. Both he and his daughter travelled widely and could have got the worms on vacation. ‘It was literally four months of infection after infection,’ Tracey Ceccarelli, above, says of her father’s strongyloidiasis. Fred Lum/The Globe and Mail After testing positive, Ms. Ceccarelli had to wait two weeks for ivermectin. “You’re told you have a parasite in your body. The first thing you think is, ‘Get it out of me,’ especially knowing that it killed my father,” she said. “I knew it wasn’t affecting me at that moment, but it’s psychological.” Part of the reason for delays, Dr. Boggild and other doctors say, is the cumbersome process. Applications have to be faxed to Ottawa, where SAP’s reviewers often reject requests at first, asking for more information on the patient or more evidence from the medical literature. After SAP authorizes a request, the drug still has to be shipped. “It has been an extremely frustrating process,” said Stephen Vaughan, a clinical assistant professor at the University of Calgary and an infectious-disease consultant. “[One response] we often get is to try an alternative medication, even though it’s been shown in high-quality studies that the SAP medication is the treatment of choice. The other [response] is just to provide more literature or better evidence, even though many of us have submitted this application 50 times. They know – or they should know – the evidence for a number of these common indications.” Delays are one issue. Gaps in Health Canada’s approach to unlicensed drugs are another. Consider cutaneous larva migrans (CLM), a skin disease caused by cat or dog hookworms common in the tropics. If one of the parasites finds its way into a human, it crawls around under the skin, searching in vain for a canine or feline blood vessel to hook onto. CLM causes itching so intense it keeps people from sleeping or working. But it does not kill. Unlike strongyloidiasis, CLM does not strictly fit SAP’s “serious” or “life-threatening” criteria, meaning SAP often – but not always – rejects requests for ivermectin or albendazole to treat it, doctors say. Ivermectin and Canada When the Japanese microbiologist Satoshi Omura and the American biologist William C. Campbell were awarded a share of the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 2015, the prize committee described their joint discovery of ivermectin as revolutionary. “The importance of ivermectin for improving the health and well-being of millions of individuals with river blindness and lymphatic filariasis, primarily in the poorest regions of the world, is immeasurable. Treatment is so successful that these diseases are on the verge of eradication, which would be a major feat in the medical history of humankind.” The pharmaceutical giant Merck, which makes Mectizan, the brand-name version of ivermectin, has donated more than two billion treatment courses of the drug since 1987, which explains why the drug is so widely available in Africa, Asia and South America. But ivermectin is not routinely available in Canada because neither Merck nor any generic manufacturer has applied to license it for such a small market. Merck only sells Mectizan in the United States, France, the Netherlands, Mexico, Japan, Australia and Taiwan, according to a spokeswoman for the company. Generic versions are available all over the world. But some other countries, including Britain, rely on their own versions of Health Canada’s Special Access Programme to obtain ivermectin on a case-by-case basis. In Canada, Merck provides ivermectin for free through the SAP. “It’s a Catch-22,” said Anne McCarthy, an Ottawa tropical-medicine doctor and the chair of the Committee to Advise on Tropical Medicine and Travel, which provides advice to the Public Health Agency of Canada. “If you say somebody has cutaneous larva migrans, it’s not unreasonable for [SAP] to reject that. That’s the problem.” Ryan Cooper, an Edmonton infectious-disease doctor who specializes in tuberculosis, has run into a similar problem with rifapentine, a medication that is not licensed in Canada, but that could help stop the spread of TB. Although rare among non-aboriginals born in Canada, TB remains a concern in First Nations communities, especially in the North. When doctors diagnose a case of active TB, they try to find the patient’s family, friends and neighbours and start them on a course of preventive treatment that can require as many as 270 pills – a pill a day for nine months. Rifapentine, combined with another drug that is already available in Canada, can provide the same result if taken once a week for three months. But a medication for patients who are not yet sick, and who have access to an alternative drug, hardly fits SAP’s mandate. Still, Dr. Cooper managed to convince SAP to release some rifapentine last year when active cases of TB were diagnosed on two reserves outside Calgary. “They gave us a few courses before they realized this was more of a routine use, rather than a special use,” he said. “I think I probably could have pushed it, but each individual case I had to negotiate. That generated quite a bit of delay in getting the pill to the ground where the patients need it.” Dr. Sharma, Health Canada’s chief medical officer, said SAP has not received many requests for rifapentine. The Public Health Agency of Canada is about to conduct a survey of TB doctors to see if there is a broader public health need for the drug, she added. But if there is a wider need for rifapentine, what can Health Canada do if no drug company can recoup its costs – never mind turn a profit – by selling the drug here? In the case of ivermectin and albendazole, Health Canada has worked behind the scenes in the past to persuade the drugs’ makers to apply for market authorization, at the urging of physicians such as Dr. McCarthy and Brian Ward, the associate director of the J.D. MacLean Centre for Tropical Diseases at McGill University in Montreal. Despite Health Canada offering expedited reviews and reduced application fees, Merck, which makes ivermectin, and GSK, which makes albendazole, have declined. Both companies give the drugs away for free through Canada’s Special Access Programme. Sandra Wainwright, the executive director of regulatory affairs at Merck Canada, said the company’s decision not to market ivermectin in Canada goes back to the mid-1990s when there was little need for the drug here. Now, as more immigrants, refugees and travellers arrive in Canada from tropical regions, Merck is reconsidering. Ms. Wainwright said Merck is in “very preliminary” discussions with Health Canada about applying to license ivermectin. “It would totally be driven by needs expressed by the community. That certainly is not a commercially driven activity.” The number of Canadians who request ivermectin through SAP may be small, but it is growing, according to figures compiled by Health Canada for The Globe and Mail. In 2015, doctors requested the drug 685 times, up 43 per cent from 444 requests in 2012. Of those requests, about 80 per cent were granted, roughly the same authorization rate as the previous three years. Requests for albendazole have bounced around more – 220 in 2015, 287 in 2014, 261 in 2013 and 234 in 2012 – and the authorization rate has ranged from a low of 62 per cent in 2012 to a high of 81 per cent in 2013. SAP requests for five other unlicensed drugs on the tropical-medicine community’s wish list ranged from a handful to several dozen annually, depending on the drug and the year. GSK declined an interview request, but a spokeswoman said by e-mail that, “due to the rare occurrence of parasitic worm infections in Canada, and the permission to provide albendazole through Health Canada’s Special Access Program, we made the decision not to seek approval to market the product locally.” Dr. Sharma said Health Canada is working hard to make SAP work better, including by asking its reviewers to pick up the phone and explain to doctors why they initially reject applications. For Dr. Vaughan in Calgary, improvements cannot come fast enough. “What I worry about most is that we’re going to have a patient that’s going to become very ill with disseminated strongyloidiasis, or they may even die, while waiting for the treatment to be approved and transferred from Ottawa to a site. I don’t want a case like that to have to happen before there are changes to the system.” Follow Kelly Grant on Twitter: @kellygrant1 MORE FROM THE GLOBE AND MAIL How a little-known patent sparked Canada’s opioid crisis Grant Robertson and Karen Howlett tell the untold story of how a single pill ignited one of the biggest pharmaceutical battles in Canadian history.

The World Health Organisation, which led the trial, says the vaccine could be available for mass use by 2018. To meet that timeline, the regulatory approval process for the vaccine is being fast-tracked. In the meantime, backed by GAVI, a global vaccine alliance, pharmaceutical giants Merck have made 300,000 doses of the vaccine available in the event of an outbreak. The possibility of an Ebola vaccine is a major leap for Africans at risk of the disease following a devastating outbreak mainly in three West African countries which started in 2014. Although now controlled, World Bank estimates put the cost of the outbreak’s economic impact at more than $3 billion in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia—the worst affected countries. Published findings from the test say results from the test “add weight to the interim assessment that rVSV-ZEBOV offers substantial protection against Ebola virus disease, with no cases among vaccinated individuals from day 10 after vaccination in both randomized and non-randomised clusters.” Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO’s assistant director-general for health systems and innovation, says the vaccine will be vital to Africa survival of another outbreak. “While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa’s Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenseless,” Kieny said.

(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko) By: Yuri Kageyama The Associated Press Published on TOKYO — Global stocks were mixed Wednesday, gaining in Asia but tracking lower in Europe, after reports showed a sharp rise in inflation in the eurozone. The Tokyo benchmark jumped in its opening day for 2017, helped by a weak yen. KEEPING SCORE: France's CAC 40 edged down 0.1 per cent to 4,896 and Germany's DAX was 0.2 per cent lower at 11,557. Britain's FTSE 100 was little changed at 7,176. U.S. shares were set to drift higher with Dow and S&P 500 futures both up 0.2 per cent . DATA: Investors were encouraged by Wednesday's release of the Nikkei Japan Manufacturing PMI, a survey of purchasing managers. The reading of 52.4 for December was its highest in a year. The figure is based on a scale of 0 to 100, where 50 marks the cutoff between contraction and expansion. In the eurozone, inflation rose to a three-year high, mainly due to higher energy costs. A survey of business activity also showed growth picking up at the end of 2016. The reports were positive on the whole for a region that has seen low inflation and stagnant growth. THE QUOTE: "Strong sentiment at the start of the year coupled with volatility could be what 2017 has in store for the markets," said Jingyi Pan, a market strategist at IG in Singapore. KIMONOS AND CLAPPING: The Tokyo Stock Exchange welcomed the new year in customary style as women in kimono clapped while Finance Minister Taro Aso rang a bell to celebrate this year's first session. The Nikkei surged nearly 500 points, as the weak yen, a boon for exporters, pushed auto shares including Honda Motor Co. higher. ASIA'S DAY: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 added 2.5 per cent to close at 19,594.16, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.1 per cent to 5,736.40. South Korea's Kospi gained nearly 0.1 per cent to 2,045.64. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dipped 0.1 per cent to 22,134.47, while the Shanghai Composite index gained 0.7 per cent to 3,158.79. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude added 20 cents to $52.53 a barrel in New York. It lost $1.39 on Tuesday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 26 cents to $55.73 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar remained strong, rising to 117.48 yen from 117.39 yen. The euro slumped to $1.0440 from $1.0481. ___ Follow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama Her work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama Editors' Picks Mark Hamill reads Donald Trump tweet in the Joker's voice Beavers with Canadian roots are an environmental enemy in South America Brazilian woman learns she was mistakenly praying to Lord of the Rings figurine Video: Serial squirrel bandits drive Toronto store owner nuts Most Popular Video: Pee jokes aplenty as Alec Baldwin returns to parody Donald Trump on SNL 'Miracle on the Hudson' legacy: 70,000 slain birds Former Halifax professor suing university, student, CTV and Twitter over 2015 intimate photo The Latest: Trump lashes out at Brennan on Twitter Back to Mobile About About Us Contact Careers RSS Feeds Terms Advertising Terms Terms and Conditions Privacy Code Metronews.ca My Metro Store Contests Metro Panel Special Features FAQ © Copyright Free Daily News Group Inc. 2001-2017 Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy

The reading of 52.4 for December was its highest in a year. The figure is based on a scale of 0 to 100, where 50 marks the shift between contraction and expansion. Manufacturers cited rising orders from the U.S., China and Europe as one factor behind the improvement. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks broke a three-day losing streak, ushering in the new year with broad gains. The Dow Jones industrial average added 119.16 points, or 0.6 percent, to 19,881.76. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 19 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,257.83. The Nasdaq composite gained 45.97 points, or 0.9 percent, to 5,429.08. THE QUOTE: "Strong sentiment at the start of the year coupled with volatility could be what 2017 has in store for the markets," said Jingyi Pan, a market strategist at IG in Singapore. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude added 33 cents to $52.66 a barrel in New York. It lost $1.39 to $52.33 a barrel on Tuesday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 34 cents to $55.81 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar remained strong, rising to 117.97 yen from 117.39 yen.

(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko) TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares were mixed Wednesday, as the Tokyo benchmark jumped in the first trading of 2017, helped by a weak yen. Other indexes lost some gains from earlier this week. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 added 2.2 percent to 19,536.72, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was little changed at 5,734.80. South Korea's Kospi edged up nearly 0.1 percent to 2,045.13. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dipped 0.2 percent to 22,104.67, while the Shanghai Composite index gained 0.1 percent to 3,139.80. KIMONOS AND CLAPPING: The Tokyo Stock Exchange welcomed the new year in customary style as women in kimono clapped while Finance Minister Taro Aso rang a bell to celebrate this year's first session. The Nikkei surged as much as 400 yen at one point, as the weak yen, a boon for exporters, pushed auto shares including Honda Motor Co. higher.

The stock market opened the year on a strong note, led by big gains in banks and energy companies. (AP Photo/Richard Drew)) NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are moving higher on the first trading day of 2017 and are on track to break a three-day losing streak. Health care companies, which fell last year as the rest of the market moved higher, are making some of the biggest gains. While stock indexes are broadly higher, they’ve surrendered most of an earlier gain. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average added 31 points, or 0.2 percent, to 19,793 as of 1:35 p.m. Eastern time. The blue-chip index rose as much as 175 points in the first hour of trading. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 9 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,248. The Nasdaq composite picked up 22 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,407. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks small-company stocks, remained at 1,357. The Russell rose almost 20 percent last year and did far better than indexes focused on larger companies. The Dow lagged behind the S&P 500 and Nasdaq in part because of losses for McDonald’s and Travelers, the insurance company. ON THE MEND: Health care stocks made some of the biggest gains. Merck & Co. rose $1.44, or 2.4 percent, to $60.31 and biotech giant Amgen picked up $4.75, or 3.2 percent, to $150.96. Prescription drug distributor McKesson gained $7.05, or 5 percent, to $147.50. The S&P 500’s health care index fell 4 percent last year. It was the only S&P 500 sector that traded lower as the S&P 500 itself rose 9.5 percent for the year. COPY THAT: Xerox surged $1, or 17.4 percent, to $6.75 after it split itself in two, a move the company announced almost a year ago. The original Xerox kept its printer and copier business. The second company will focus on business process outsourcing, providing payment processing and other services. Xerox will receive $1.8 billion in cash. The new company, Conduent Inc., now trades under the ticker symbol “CNDT.” That stock lost 94 cents, or 6.3 percent, to $13.97. ENERGY: Oil prices turned lower after jumping more than 2 percent early in the day. U.S. crude gave up $1.24, or 2.3 percent, to $52.48 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, skidded $1.16, or 2 percent, to $55.66 a barrel in London. Despite that slump, energy companies traded higher. But natural gas companies dropped as natural gas futures dropped 10.6 percent. Southwestern Energy lost 96 cents, or 8.9 percent, to $9.86 and Cabot Oil & Gas gave up $1.26, or 5.8 percent, to $22. MANUFACTURING ACTION: The manufacturing sector continued its recovery and ended 2016 on a strong note. The Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index rose to 54.7 in December, its highest reading of the year. That was the fourth straight month of expansion and the ninth out of the last 10. The result was a bit stronger than analysts expected. MISSING 2016: Graphics processor maker Nvidia couldn’t break out of a recent slump. The stock more than tripled in value last year, but hit a wall in the final days of trading. The stock slid $6.61, or 6.2 percent, to $100.13. It’s down 14 percent since Dec. 27, when it closed at an all-time high. DOUBLE CLICKED: Technology stocks also traded higher. Facebook added $1.91, or 1.7 percent, to $116.96 and Alphabet, Google’s parent company, rose $16.20, or 2 percent, to $808.65. On Monday Alphabet announced a partnership with Fiat Chrysler. The companies will work together on a connected car system. Fiat Chrysler stock picked up 44 cents, or 4.8 percent, to $9.56. BONDS: Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.46 percent from 2.43 percent late Friday. Utility companies fell, as did real estate investment trusts and companies that make and sell household goods. Those stocks are often compared to bonds because they pay large dividends, but the jump in yields Tuesday encouraged investors to look elsewhere. CURRENCIES: The dollar jumped to 117.35 yen from 116.78 yen. The euro slumped to $1.0427 from $1.0531. OVERSEAS: The FTSE 100 index in Britain rose 0.5 percent to another all-time high. The French CAC 40 added 0.3 percent. Germany’s DAX slipped 0.1 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index gained 0.7 percent and the Kospi in South Korea rose 0.9 percent. Tokyo’s stock market remained closed for the New Year’s holiday.   Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) More Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to send this to your Kindle device (Opens in new window) Related Posts US stocks surge following Trump victory; Bond prices tumble Global markets mixed in quiet trading after US holiday Federal Reserve raises key interest rate for 1st time in year US stocks mixed in early trade; bond prices tumble Advertisement « Previous Story — Next Story » Advertisement Trending on WKRN.com Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement WKRN.com All content © Copyright 2000 - 2017 Young Broadcasting of Nashville LLC A Media General Company.

(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko) TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares were mixed Wednesday, as the Tokyo benchmark jumped in the first trading of 2017, helped by a weak yen. Other indexes lost some gains from earlier this week. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 added 2.2 percent to 19,536.72, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was little changed at 5,734.80. South Korea's Kospi edged up nearly 0.1 percent to 2,045.13. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dipped 0.2 percent to 22,104.67, while the Shanghai Composite index gained 0.1 percent to 3,139.80. KIMONOS AND CLAPPING: The Tokyo Stock Exchange welcomed the new year in customary style as women in kimono clapped while Finance Minister Taro Aso rang a bell to celebrate this year's first session. The Nikkei surged as much as 400 yen at one point, as the weak yen, a boon for exporters, pushed auto shares including Honda Motor Co. higher. JAPAN MANUFACTURING: Investors were encouraged by Wednesday's release of the Nikkei Japan Manufacturing PMI, a survey of purchasing managers. The reading of 52.4 for December was its highest in a year. The figure is based on a scale of 0 to 100, where 50 marks the shift between contraction and expansion. Manufacturers cited rising orders from the U.S., China and Europe as one factor behind the improvement. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks broke a three-day losing streak, ushering in the new year with broad gains. The Dow Jones industrial average added 119.16 points, or 0.6 percent, to 19,881.76. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 19 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,257.83. The Nasdaq composite gained 45.97 points, or 0.9 percent, to 5,429.08. THE QUOTE: "Strong sentiment at the start of the year coupled with volatility could be what 2017 has in store for the markets," said Jingyi Pan, a market strategist at IG in Singapore. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude added 33 cents to $52.66 a barrel in New York. It lost $1.39 to $52.33 a barrel on Tuesday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 34 cents to $55.81 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar remained strong, rising to 117.97 yen from 117.39 yen. The euro slumped to $1.0404 from $1.0481. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko) TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares were mixed Wednesday, as the Tokyo benchmark jumped in the first trading of 2017, helped by a weak yen. Other indexes lost some gains from earlier this week. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 added 2.2 percent to 19,536.72, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was little changed at 5,734.80. South Korea's Kospi edged up nearly 0.1 percent to 2,045.13. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dipped 0.2 percent to 22,104.67, while the Shanghai Composite index gained 0.1 percent to 3,139.80. KIMONOS AND CLAPPING: The Tokyo Stock Exchange welcomed the new year in customary style as women in kimono clapped while Finance Minister Taro Aso rang a bell to celebrate this year's first session. The Nikkei surged as much as 400 yen at one point, as the weak yen, a boon for exporters, pushed auto shares including Honda Motor Co. higher. JAPAN MANUFACTURING: Investors were encouraged by Wednesday's release of the Nikkei Japan Manufacturing PMI, a survey of purchasing managers. The reading of 52.4 for December was its highest in a year. The figure is based on a scale of 0 to 100, where 50 marks the shift between contraction and expansion. Manufacturers cited rising orders from the U.S., China and Europe as one factor behind the improvement. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks broke a three-day losing streak, ushering in the new year with broad gains. The Dow Jones industrial average added 119.16 points, or 0.6 percent, to 19,881.76. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 19 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,257.83. The Nasdaq composite gained 45.97 points, or 0.9 percent, to 5,429.08. THE QUOTE: "Strong sentiment at the start of the year coupled with volatility could be what 2017 has in store for the markets," said Jingyi Pan, a market strategist at IG in Singapore. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude added 33 cents to $52.66 a barrel in New York. It lost $1.39 to $52.33 a barrel on Tuesday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 34 cents to $55.81 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar remained strong, rising to 117.97 yen from 117.39 yen. The euro slumped to $1.0404 from $1.0481. ___ Follow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama Her work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama Tags Business General News Oil And Gas Industry Stock Markets Leading Economic Indicators Economy Energy Industry Financial Markets Commodity Markets Gas Utilities Corporate Stock Corporate News Energy Equipment Manufacturing Industrial Machinery And Equipment Industrial Products And Services Consumer Product Manufacturing Consumer Products And Services Utilities Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Health Care Industry Prices Manufacturing Sector Performance Locations United States East Asia North America Asia Japan Tokyo Popular A frank discussion Dothan photographer faces 186 child porn possession charges Josh Parrish hired as Northview head football coach 25th anniversary of the Troy Trojans basketball team scoring a record-setting 258 points Ex-Elba QB Johnson fulfills dream with Tide Lopez, Melinda Traylor Renaissance Faire coming to Enterprise Dothan man describes Fort Lauderdale airport shooting: 'That could have been me' Bethel Baptist Church to open private academy in east Dothan Fort Rucker flight training contract could be worth $450 million for CAE USA Contests Bridal Extravaganza Ticket Giveaway Sections News Sports Lifestyles Obituaries Photos Weather Services Contact Us Subscription Rates Submission Forms Newspapers Enterprise Ledger Jackson Co.

The stock market opened the year on a strong note, led by big gains in banks and energy companies. NEW YORK >> U.S. stocks are moving higher on the first trading day of 2017. Health care companies, which fell last year as the rest of the market moved higher, are making some of the biggest gains. While stock indexes are broadly higher, they’ve surrendered most of an earlier gain. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average added 36 points, or 0.2 percent, to 19,798 as of 12:20 p.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 10 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,248. The Nasdaq composite picked up 24 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,407. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks small-company stocks, lagged the market as it edged up 2 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,359. The Russell rose almost 20 percent last year and did far better than indexes focused on larger companies. U.S. stocks are coming off a three-day losing streak. ON THE MEND: Health care stocks made some of the biggest gains at midday Tuesday. Merck & Co. rose $1.27, or 2.2 percent, to $60.14 and biotech giant Amgen picked up $4.23, or 2.9 percent, to $150.44. Prescription drug distributor McKesson gained $5.86, or 4.2 percent, to $146.31. The S&P 500’s health care index fell 4 percent last year. It was the only S&P 500 sector that traded lower as the S&P 500 itself rose 9.5 percent for the year. BONDS: Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.47 percent from 2.43 percent late Friday. Higher bond yields are linked to higher interest rates, and bank stocks made big gains. Citigroup rose 90 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $60.33 and Morgan Stanley picked up 55 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $42.80. Banks and energy companies both climbed more than 20 percent last year. Utility companies fell, and real estate investment trusts and companies that make and sell household goods made far smaller gains than the rest of the market. Those stocks are often compared to bonds because they pay large dividends, but the jump in yields Tuesday encouraged investors to look elsewhere. COPY THAT: Xerox surged 91 cents, or 15.8 percent, to $6.66 after it split itself in two, a move the company announced almost a year ago. The original Xerox kept its printer and copier business. The second company will focus on business process outsourcing, providing payment processing and other services. Xerox will receive $1.8 billion in cash. The new company, Conduent Inc., now trades under the ticker symbol “CNDT.” That stock lost $1.02, or 6.9 percent, to $13.88. ENERGY: Oil prices turned lower after jumping more than 2 percent early in the day. U.S. crude gave up $1.26, or 2.3 percent, to $52.47 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, skidded $1.28, or 2.3 percent, to $55.54 a barrel in London. Meanwhile natural gas companies dropped as natural gas futures dropped 12.2 percent. Southwestern Energy lost 99 cents, or 9.1 percent, to $9.83 and Cabot Oil & Gas gave up $1.52, or 6.5 percent, to $21.84. MANUFACTURING ACTION: The manufacturing sector continued its recovery and ended 2016 on a strong note. The Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index rose to 54.7 in December, its highest reading of the year. That was the fourth straight month of expansion and the ninth out of the last 10. The result was a bit stronger than analysts expected.

News Sports Entertainment Life Opinion Obituaries ePaper Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive US stocks ring in 2017 with gains as health care stocks rise Tuesday Jan 3, 2017 at 10:36 AM Jan 3, 2017 at 12:36 PM Marley Jay The Associated Press NEW YORK - U.S. stocks are moving higher on the first trading day of 2017. Health care companies, which fell last year as the rest of the market moved higher, are making some of the biggest gains. While stock indexes are broadly higher, they've surrendered most of an earlier gain.     KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average added 36 points, or 0.2 percent, to 19,798 as of 12:20 p.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 10 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,248. The Nasdaq composite picked up 24 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,407. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks small-company stocks, lagged the market as it edged up 2 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,359. The Russell rose almost 20 percent last year and did far better than indexes focused on larger companies. U.S. stocks are coming off a three-day losing streak. ON THE MEND: Health care stocks made some of the biggest gains at midday Tuesday. Merck & Co. rose $1.27, or 2.2 percent, to $60.14 and biotech giant Amgen picked up $4.23, or 2.9 percent, to $150.44. Prescription drug distributor McKesson gained $5.86, or 4.2 percent, to $146.31. The S&P 500's health care index fell 4 percent last year. It was the only S&P 500 sector that traded lower as the S&P 500 itself rose 9.5 percent for the year. BONDS: Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.47 percent from 2.43 percent late Friday. Higher bond yields are linked to higher interest rates, and bank stocks made big gains. Citigroup rose 90 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $60.33 and Morgan Stanley picked up 55 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $42.80. Banks and energy companies both climbed more than 20 percent last year. Utility companies fell, and real estate investment trusts and companies that make and sell household goods made far smaller gains than the rest of the market. Those stocks are often compared to bonds because they pay large dividends, but the jump in yields Tuesday encouraged investors to look elsewhere. COPY THAT: Xerox surged 91 cents, or 15.8 percent, to $6.66 after it split itself in two, a move the company announced almost a year ago. The original Xerox kept its printer and copier business. The second company will focus on business process outsourcing, providing payment processing and other services. Xerox will receive $1.8 billion in cash. The new company, Conduent Inc., now trades under the ticker symbol "CNDT." That stock lost $1.02, or 6.9 percent, to $13.88. ENERGY: Oil prices turned lower after jumping more than 2 percent early in the day. U.S. crude gave up $1.26, or 2.3 percent, to $52.47 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, skidded $1.28, or 2.3 percent, to $55.54 a barrel in London. Meanwhile natural gas companies dropped as natural gas futures dropped 12.2 percent. Southwestern Energy lost 99 cents, or 9.1 percent, to $9.83 and Cabot Oil & Gas gave up $1.52, or 6.5 percent, to $21.84. MANUFACTURING ACTION: The manufacturing sector continued its recovery and ended 2016 on a strong note. The Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index rose to 54.7 in December, its highest reading of the year. That was the fourth straight month of expansion and the ninth out of the last 10. The result was a bit stronger than analysts expected.

(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko) TOKYO - Global shares rose Wednesday as gains in the U.S. and Asian markets carried over into European trading. The Tokyo benchmark jumped in the opening day for 2017, helped by a weak yen. KEEPING SCORE: France's CAC 40 edged up 0.2 per cent to 4,910.99 in early trading, and Germany's DAX was unchanged at 11,583.90. Britain's FTSE 100 opened higher but was little changed at 7,175.43. U.S. shares were set to drift higher with Dow futures up 0.1 per cent at 19,821. S&P 500 futures rose 0.1 per cent to 2,255.60. KIMONOS AND CLAPPING: The Tokyo Stock Exchange welcomed the new year in customary style as women in kimono clapped while Finance Minister Taro Aso rang a bell to celebrate this year's first session. The Nikkei surged nearly 500 points, as the weak yen, a boon for exporters, pushed auto shares including Honda Motor Co. higher. JAPAN MANUFACTURING: Investors were encouraged by Wednesday's release of the Nikkei Japan Manufacturing PMI, a survey of purchasing managers. The reading of 52.4 for December was its highest in a year. The figure is based on a scale of 0 to 100, where 50 marks the cutoff between contraction and expansion. Manufacturers cited rising orders from the U.S., China and Europe as one factor behind the improvement. THE QUOTE: "Strong sentiment at the start of the year coupled with volatility could be what 2017 has in store for the markets," said Jingyi Pan, a market strategist at IG in Singapore. ASIA'S DAY: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 added 2.5 per cent to close at 19,594.16, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.1 per cent to 5,736.40.

Published Fri, Dec 16, 2016  |  David Dittman, Editorial Director This particular bureaucracy neither gives nor takes. Data do. If a drug works, the company that develops it will do well. If a drug doesn’t work, the company that develops it had better have a diversified pipeline. Many of the 4,000 or so drugs in the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) approval system are there because of the work of intrepid scientists employed by small-cap companies. Some are so unique they gain special status. Some generate positive clinical trial results. Some generate negative clinical trial results. It can be a long, cumbersome, and expensive gauntlet. But “efficacy” can be an elusive target when it comes to complex chemical interactions. FDA decisions are, ultimately, driven by data, not by some nefarious desire to stymie innovators’ and entrepreneurs’ desire to save lives. Here’s how it works. Phase 1 trials are about safety. They typically involve 20–80 patient volunteers, with testing designed to identify a candidate drug’s most frequent side effects and how it’s metabolized and excreted. Phase 2 emphasizes effectiveness, with a patient volunteer pool numbering in the hundreds and the trial often placebo-controlled. The goal is to gather sufficient data to determine whether the drug actually works for its intended purpose. Safety and short-term side effects are also evaluated. Phase 3 trials typically involve thousands of patient-volunteers. Here, more data are gathered about safety and effectiveness, while testing is fine-tuned to assess impact on different populations at varying dosages and in combination with other drugs. Many of the 4,000 or so drugs in the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) approval system are there because of the work of intrepid scientists employed by small-cap companies. The FDA’s New Drug Application (NDA) review involves a meeting with a drug’s sponsor, a formal submission of the drug, a formal review of all research on safety and effectiveness, an evaluation of drug labeling for appropriate information, and an inspection of the facility where the drug will be manufactured. Following all that, the FDA will either approve the application or issue a response letter. The former is, obviously, positive. The latter is not. Even after a drug is approved, the FDA continues to monitor it, as “it’s not possible to predict all of a drug’s effects during clinical trials.” During the Phase 4 post-marketing monitoring stage, a drug sponsor submits periodic safety updates. “Fast Track Designation” is an alternative FDA process designed to facilitate faster approval of drugs developed for serious diseases that “address an unmet medical need.” “Breakthrough Therapy Designation” speeds the development and review of drugs meant for a serious condition where “preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s).” “Accelerated Approval” regulations allow FDA to base approval of drugs “for serious conditions that fill an unmet medical need on whether the drug has an effect on a surrogate or an intermediate clinical endpoint.” “Priority Review” is granted in cases where a drug, if approved, represents “a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness in the treatment of a serious condition.” Meanwhile, “Orphan Drug Designation” provides clinical trial tax credits, user fee waivers, and exclusivity to incentivize development of drugs for rare diseases. Phase 3 is perhaps the most important catalyst. Results here “are very important for biotech companies, as they offer insight into the real effectiveness of a drug in human patients and drives [sic] the ultimate market valuation.” At all points along the way, there are opportunities to make profits and suffer losses, based on positive or negative decisions and results. Analysis by Thomas J. Hwang, formerly a researcher at Harvard Medical School and an associate in healthcare investment with Bain Capital Ventures, supports the conclusion that trial data matter for stock prices of publicly traded companies: The release of clinical trial results is an economically significant event and has meaningful effects on market value for large biopharmaceutical companies. Stock return underperformance due to negative events is greater in magnitude and persists longer than abnormal returns due to positive events, suggesting asymmetric market reactions. Although his study was limited to “large biopharmaceutical companies,” including Amgen Inc. (AMGN), Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY), Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY), Merck & Co. Inc. (MRK), and Pfizer Inc. (PFE), Hwang notes, “These findings confirm and extend previous scholarship on the significant market reactions to clinical trial results for biotechnology companies with few compounds in development.” At all points along the way, there are opportunities to make profits and suffer losses, based on positive or negative decisions and results. FDA catalysts affect large- as well as small-cap drug developers. At the same time, research suggests small caps will react more violently in terms of changes in market capitalization than large caps. Indeed, we have ample supporting evidence developed just in the first two weeks of December. Take, for instance, Achaogen Inc. (AKAO), now a $377 million company. Achaogen announced on December 12 that its Phase 3 trial of plazomicin, for patients with complicated urinary tract infections and acute pyelonephritis, “met the FDA objective of noninferiority compared with meropenem and achieved superiority for the European Medicines Agency (EMA) primary efficacy endpoints.” The stock closed at $5.25 on December 9, closed at $13.03 on December 12, traded as high as $16.20 on the day after the announcement, and is now priced at $14.00. That’s a gain of 166%. Vericel Corp. (VCEL), now valued at $140 million, received FDA approval for its Maci (autologous cultured chondrocytes on porcine collagen membrane) therapy “for the repair of symptomatic, full-thickness cartilage defects of the knee in adult patients” on December 13. The stock closed at $2.60 on December 13, opened at $4.00 on December 14, hit $4.55 that day, and closed at $4.10. It’s now trading at $3.50, up 34% in two days. Voyager Therapeutics Inc. (VYGR) surged as much as 33% on positive interim results for its Phase 1b trial of VY-AADC01 for advanced Parkinson’s disease, announced on December 7. On December 8, the stock gapped up at the open to $17.50 and traded as high as $18.25. This was a short-term bounce — illustrating the fleeting momentum such early clinical results provide — as the stock is now trading at $14.69. That’s still a 7% gain since the results were announced. Note that stocks often move days before announcements of key clinical trial results, possibly the result of insider knowledge of key clinical trial data. Corcept Therapeutics Inc. (CORT), which develops drugs for severe metabolic, psychiatric, and oncologic disorders, bounced from $6.92 on November 1 to $10.00 on November 14. But it didn’t announce efficacy data from its Phase 1/2 trial of its drug mifepristone in patients with metastatic or triple-negative breast cancer until December 10. The stock has settled back a bit, closing at $8.51 yesterday. An FDA determination of special status can also be a powerful catalyst. On September 19, 2016, the FDA “granted” Sarepta Therapeutics Inc. (SRPT) “accelerated approval” for its Exondys 51 injection therapy – the first drug approved to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Exondys 51 enjoyed Fast Track Designation, Priority Review, and Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA. According to the FDA, “Exondys 51 is specifically indicated for patients who have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene amenable to exon 51 skipping, which affects about 13% of the population with DMD.” In its press release announcing the approval, the FDA further explained: Exondys 51 was approved under the accelerated approval pathway, which provides for the approval of drugs that treat serious or life-threatening diseases and generally provide a meaningful advantage over existing treatments. Approval under this pathway can be based on adequate and well-controlled studies showing the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit to patients (how a patient feels or functions or whether they survive). This pathway provides earlier patient access to promising new drugs while the company conducts clinical trials to verify the predicted clinical benefit. The approval was controversial, as many FDA insiders opposed it. Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, recently explained to CNBC that this surprise approval is indicative of the agency’s “broader move toward patient-focused drug development.” Sarepta’s share price nearly doubled on September 19, opening at $28.81 and trading as high as $56.18 before closing at $48.94. FDA catalysts affect large- as well as small-cap drug developers. At the same time, research suggests small caps will react more violently in terms of changes in market capitalization than large caps. Stocks move on negative data, too. Cerecor Inc. (CERC) tanked on November 30 but didn’t release its top-line clinical results from its nicotine withdrawal Phase 2 clinical trial of CERC-501, an oral, potent, and selective kappa opioid receptor antagonist, until December 5. As Cerecor noted in its announcement: The trial did not meet its primary objective in nicotine withdrawal. CERC-501 was well tolerated. Based on this favorable side-effect profile, and as previously planned, Cerecor intends to move forward with development of CERC-501 in its primary indication, as an adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). The stock opened at $5.12 on November 29 (against a 52-week high of $5.60) and closed at $4.72 that day. On November 30, it gapped lower at the open to $2.34, traded as low as $1.90, and closed at $2.08. By December 5, the day the data emerged, it was trading as low as $1.10. It closed at $1.16 yesterday. On December 12, Proteon Therapeutics Inc. (PRTO) closed at $9.90. At 8:30 a.m. ET on December 13, it released top-line Phase 3 data for its chronic kidney disease therapy, which “did not meet its primary endpoint of improved primary unassisted patency compared to placebo.” The stock opened that day at $2.90 and is now trading at $2.05. Ophthotech Corp. (OPHT) tanked after its own Phase 3 failure, as “no benefits were observed” from its Fovista treatment for “wet age-related macular degeneration.” It closed at $38.77 on December 9. It opened at $6.24 on December 12 and is now trading at $4.86. Old Things New Farnam Street has a nice list of literary classics that “influence and inspire,” including The Great Gatsby, The Remains of the Day, The Catcher in the Rye, A Wrinkle in Time, the Foundation trilogy, and The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. That three novels from Neal Stephenson make it – “the sci-fi author… comes up multiple times in the reading lists of some incredibly successful individuals” – is a sure sign I need to incorporate his works on my “to read” list. As Shane Parrish notes: Fiction resonates with us because it shows us truths about the human condition through great storytelling and compelling narratives. Through an engaging story we can be introduced to big ideas that just don’t resonate the same way in nonfiction: The medium allows for freedom of thought through creativity.

More than two-thirds of healthy American adults are infected. There are more than 120 different types of HPV. Most HPV infections are asymptomatic and result in no clinical disease. There are vaccines that will help prevent the most common and dangerous types of HPV. Symptoms of HPV infection are the results of what type of HPV a person is infected with and some of them are very dangerous. These include anal and genital warts, changes in the cervical cells, and cancers of the cervix, anus, vagina, vulvar, penis, mouth and throat. Infection with one type of HPV does not keep you from getting another type. Of people infected with HPV, 5 to 30 percent are infected with multiple types of the virus. Anal and genital HPV infection is believed to be the most common sexually transmitted infection in the U.S. About 79 million people are infected, and it is estimated that 14 million new HPV infections occurs annually with half of those in people between 15 and 24 years old. The most common types of HPV that lead to cervical cancer are types 16 and 18. These account for about 70 percent of cervical cancers. In addition to cervical cancer, HPV is believed to be responsible for 90 percent of anal cancers; 71 percent of vulvar, vaginal and penile cancers; and about 72 percent of mouth and throat cancers. According to data from the National Institutes of Health and The National Cancer Institute, Victoria County has a higher rate of cervical cancer than the national and state rate. Victoria County has a rate of 11.7 per 100,000. The state rate is 9.2 per 100,000 and the national rate is 7.2 per 100,000. Two HPV vaccines are licensed in the U.S. Merck's brand called Gardasil 4 was approved by the FDA in June 2006. This vaccine protects against four different types of HPV - types 6 and 11, which cause genital warts; and 16 and 18, which cause most of the cancers. This vaccine is approved for both females and males age 9 through 26 years. Gardasil is given as a three-dose series. The first and second doses are separated by two months and the third dose is given six months from the first dose. Another of Merck's brand is Gardasil 9, which was approved by the FDA in December 2014. This vaccine protects against types 6, 11, 16 and 18. It also protects against types 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58. With the additional types, we now have protection against 90 percent of cervical cancers. This vaccine is indicated for females 9 through 26 years of age. The American Committee on Immunization Practices also recommends routine vaccination in males 9 through 26 years of age. This vaccine is usually given in a three-dose series. The first and second doses are separated by two months, and the third dose is given six months from the first dose. The ideal time to start this vaccine is between the ages of 11 and 12 when other school required vaccines are given because the immune response is best, but anyone between 9 and 26 can get the vaccine. The ACIP just recently recommended a two-dose series of Gardasil 9 given to females and males 9 through 14 years of age separated by six to 12 months. Studies have shown that the vaccine is just as effective with the two-dose series compared to the three-dose series in this age group. With January being Cervical Cancer Awareness Month, there is no better time to protect you or your children against cancers that are now vaccine-preventable. HPV vaccines are given at the health department. For more information, call your physician or the Victoria County Public Health Department at 361-578-6281.

Dr Deirdre Hollingsworth, who leads the Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) Modelling Consortium, led an international team that has discovered that if a recently proposed combination of three particular drugs is used together, the disease can be prevented or treated rapidly, in a maximum amount of people, using fewer rounds of drugs. Lymphatic filariasis is a neglected tropical disease, which causes serious damage to the lymphatic system. It is caused by parasitic worms, and is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. Many people with the disease develop elephantiasis or lymphoedema, causing pain and profound disfigurement - such as large swelling of the arms, legs or genitals - and leading to permanent disability. These patients are not only physically disabled, but suffer mental, social and financial losses contributing to stigma and poverty. A large proportion of the billion people living with the threat of transmission are in India, Indonesia and Myanmar where the triple drug combination could be used. Currently, people with Lymphatic filariasis require multiple rounds of treatment - but if the drugs ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine, and albendazole are used together recent clinical studies have shown that the drugs are more effective at killing the worms. The new modelling work shows that this meant that the number of rounds of mass drug administration needed to treat the disease may fall from many rounds to only two or three. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has targeted the disease for elimination as a public health problem by the by the year 2020. The drug companies Merck, GlaxoSmithKline and Eisai have pledged to donate drugs to help eradicate the disease globally. Initial studies show the triple drug regimen is far more effective at clearing the parasite from its human host and that is has a good safety profile. However, experts note that campaigns can run into trouble when they go on for too long because populations can lose interest in taking the drug when the disease is not very common. At this stage the researchers can't predict how fast this new regimen will speed up elimination, and if so, in which countries. Mathematical models were used simulate a mass drug administration campaign in different settings. As there are many unknowns about the transmission of the disease and how a population responds to intervention, three independently-developed models were used to estimate the impact of the new regimen. The models were developed at the University of Warwick, Erasmus Medical Centre, and Notre Dame Universities. All three models were in agreement in the effectiveness of the regimen in reducing the prevalence of disease. The researchers noted that more effective treatment with fewer drugs rounds is crucial in poorer countries where transmission is high but resources are low. Dr Hollingsworth, who is based at the University of Warwick's Mathematics Institute and School of Life Sciences, comments: "This more effective treatment has the potential to revolutionise the control of this disease, but it will require that in over a few rounds of treatment the programs are able to treat almost the whole population, even the most inaccessible. Dr Mike Irvine, University of British Columbia in Canada, is the first author of the paper, said: "Our results show that this regimen could potentially overcome important issues plagued by elimination campaigns, by making elimination as a public health problem achievable in a few years." Dr Wilma Stolk, from Erasmus Medical Centre, added: "We use very different approaches, but our models all have the same message. This new drug regimen can reduce the number of rounds, but it still depends on the programs being well-run. Even with the best possible regimen elimination is difficult to achieve if many people repeatedly don't participate in mass drug administration." Professor Edwin Michael, from Notre Dame University said: "This study demonstrates the power of using multiple models, an important trend in complex systems modelling and use of models for policy making. It allows us to be sure that our insights are robust."

They used the same strategy that was used to eradicate smallpox in the 1970s. Called ring vaccination, it calls for vaccinating people who have been in contact with patients, and contacts of contacts. Doctor Francis Kateh from Redemption Hospital volunteering to receive a trial vaccine against Ebola at Redemption Hospital on the outskirts of Monrovia. ZOOM DOSSO / AFP - Getty Images file It worked, the team led by the World Health Organization found. "Vaccine efficacy was 100 percent," they wrote in their report, published in Friday's issue of the Lancet medical journal. "While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa's Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenseless," said WHO's Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, who led the trial. Related: Experimental Vaccine Could Stop Ebola It's not a surprise - researchers had been working on an Ebola vaccine for years but because the virus only usually caused occasional, small outbreaks, it was hard to test it. “Vaccine efficacy was 100 percent.” Plus no governments or companies had invested the time or money needed to develop a vaccine. Then the epidemic started in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia in late 2013. By the time it was completely stopped earlier this year, it had infected 28,000 people and killed more than 11,000 of them. Researchers rushed several vaccines into production. This vaccine was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada, which licensed it to a company called NewLink Genetics. Pharma giant Merck & Co. bought the license and is making it. Related: Ebola Vaccine Trials Offer Hope It uses an animal virus called vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). The virus is harmless to people. Vaccine makers genetically engineered it to carry a little piece of Ebola DNA to stimulate an immune response. Experts including Dr. Donald A. Henderson of John Hopkins University, who helped led the campaign to eradicate smallpox, designed a ring vaccination trial. Henderson died in August. By the time all this work was done, the epidemic was waning. It's hard to test a vaccine if disease is not spreading, but the international team tried it out in a coastal region of Guinea where Ebola cases were still being reported. Related: Experimental Ebola Shot Looks Good The virus spreads by direct contact, either between people or with bodily fluids such as blood from someone very ill with Ebola, or who has died from it. The researchers tracked down every person who may have been in contact with a case, including family members and friends. Then they found people who had been in contact with those people. Each of these "rings" ended up including about 80 people. “We are proud that we have been able to contribute to developing a vaccine that will prevent other nations from enduring what we endured.” Half got vaccine and half did not. The trial was stopped when it became clear that the vaccine was truly protecting people from infection, even after they'd been in direct contact with an Ebola victim. The Food and Drug Administration gave the vaccine breakthrough designation to allow quick licensing. GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, has made a $5 million down payment to Merck to make sure the vaccine is available when it's next needed. Merck has promised to make 300,000 doses of the vaccine available for emergency use. "Ebola left a devastating legacy in our country. We are proud that we have been able to contribute to developing a vaccine that will prevent other nations from enduring what we endured," said Dr KeÏta Sakoba, coordinator of the Ebola response in Guinea.

Bloom, MLS., MSEd., CPL., CKMI. Ted Bloom, MLS., MSEd., CPL.,CKMI.,Fake news.  It is the latest media buzzword or term.  Transparent is another beauty.  May I recommend www.thefreedictionary.com as it has multiple dictionaries, such as: medical, legal and financial ones?  It also contains an encyclopedia and many foreign language translations.  Consider fake news: the first newspaper was published in Rome by orders of Julius Caesar in 59 B.C.  My point here, is fake news is far from being new.  News is supposed to be new.  News and newspapers have been making corrections for their published mistakes for ages, literally.  Fake news has been around so long that dictionaries have several names for it, such as: propaganda, blowback, misinformation, disinformation, gossip, dirty laundry, bum steers... However, there are a few websites one may wish to consult when trying to decipher any news.  Visit www.factcheck.org for a nonpartisan, nonprofit “consumer advocate” for voters that aims to reduce the level of deception and confusion in politics courtesy of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania.  Go to www.snopes.com for urban legends, folklore, myths, rumors, and misinformation.  They even accept reader rumors to debunk and publish.  I was informed in library school that mainstream media will publish whatever the government wants it to.  One creative alternative to mainstream news is a group of outstanding independent journalists, whose ringleader in the accomplished global pharmaceutical buster "America's Lawyer" Mike Papantonio along with his side-kick, ecology expert, Attorney Robert Kennedy, Jr., with such renowned writers as historian Thom Hartmann and Trial Lawyer Magazine Editor, Farron Cousins.  They may be found with comedian-journalist Sam Seder on www.ringofireradio.com or www.trof.com.  It is a great website for coverage of uncommon events the mainstream overlooks, such as the Dakota Pipeline scandal and protests, or pharmaceutical scams with major players such as Bayer, Merck, Pfizer or Johnson & Johnson. Moreover, another way to combat the onslaught of fake news lately, is to use common sense and question everything, such as: Is the source listed at all?  If so, is the source an accomplished professional with universal credentials such as education related degrees, awards or publications in their field?  Is proper spelling and grammar used?  Is the data located on a reputable source, known for its reporting accuracy or is found where anyone of any age or experience may post information, such as an online wiki like www.wikipedia.com?  Question more. Ted Bloom, MLS., MSEd., CPL.,CKMI., NP has been a published columnist in New York since 1999. A librarian and professor with two graduate degrees, some of his credentials include, creating and running a career preparation computer lab for at-risk youth through the U.S. Department of Labor, as well as being a NYS Notary Public, SUNY Communications Instructor, a YMCA Director and a Certified Krav Maga Instructor.  His first book The Librarian's Guide to Employment in the Information Age is now available on Amazon.com.             2017-01-04 / Front Page It’s In Queens!

Ms. Laurora claims she was fired after arguing her pregnant co-worker should not be taken off of a project just because she wanted to take maternity leave. “Pregnant women should never fear that they are missing out on a job opportunity by taking the maternity leave they are legally owed,” Shegerian says. “And no employee should feel they will be harshly and unfairly penalized for voicing their concerns over unethical and illegal discrimination.” “If these allegations are true, Ms. Laurora has demonstrated incredible bravery in the face of adversity, not once, but twice,” Shegerian continues. “She had the courage to defend her pregnant co-worker in front of her superiors, and then to defend all employees’ rights by taking legal action against Bayer.” “Unfortunately, these allegations are very similar to the gender discrimination claims made against another pharmaceutical giant, Merck, earlier this year,” Shegerian states. “These cases show it is possible for victims to seek justice against their employers, regardless of the company’s size or perceived power within the industry.” Located in Santa Monica, Shegerian & Associates is a law firm specializing in protecting the rights of employees who have been wronged by their employers. Richly experienced in labor and employment law and possessing an unparalleled success record as litigators, Shegerian & Associates is passionately dedicated to serving the needs of its clients.

Skip to content Military Technologies pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 3 January 20173 January 2017 by Treatment for Syndromes of Dementia and Movement Disorders Market to Reach a Valuation of US$ 21,154.8 Million by 2020 According to a new market report published by Persistence Market Research “Global Market Study on Treatment for Syndromes of Dementia and Movement Disorders: Asia to Witness Highest Growth by 2020,” the global treatment for syndromes of dementia and movement disorders market was valued at USD 12,859.8 million in 2014 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.6% from 2014 to 2020, to reach an estimated value of USD 21,154.8 million in 2020. A Sample of this report is available upon request @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/2833 The treatment for syndromes of dementia and movement disorders market is witnessing significant growth due to increasing R&D investments in drug discovery and developments. In addition, increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative disorders and rising awareness about mental disorders are also driving the growth of the market. However, most of the drugs fail in Phase III due to lack of sufficient knowledge about the mechanisms of the brain and the unknown causes of the disease. In addition, lack of comprehensive therapeutic management, strict regulations, and time-consuming drug approval process inhibit the growth of the market. The global treatment for syndromes of dementia and movement disorders market is anticipated to grow from an estimated USD 12,859.8 million in 2014 to USD 21,154.8 million in 2020 at a CAGR of 8.6% during the forecast period. In North America, growing aging population and rising incidence of neurodegenerative disease are driving the use of treatment for syndromes of dementia and movement disorders in the market. In addition, lack of proper medication is also fuelling the growth of treatments for syndromes of dementia and movement disorders market. In Europe, the treatment for syndromes of dementia and movement disorders market is driven by rising incidence of mental disorder related disease and growing aging population. On the other hand, various awareness programs were launched by public and private health institutions to control dementia and movement disorders, which would increase the use of dementia and movement disorder drugs in the region. However, in Asia the growth for treatment for syndromes of dementia and movement disorders is much higher than developed countries due to widening health insurance penetration, and large population base.

Today I am conducting the same exercise for Australia’s ASX 300. This is a particularly illiquid time of year and it takes less capital for traders to move markets. This is easiest where accelerated moves are in evidence, stops will have been placed and algorithmic systems have little difficulty identifying them.   Euro Jumps 1.6 Percent in Minutes as Algo Orders Surprise Market This article by Michael G. Wilson and Kevin Buckland for Bloomberg may be of interest to subscribers. Here is a section: The euro surged as much as 1.6 percent against the dollar in the Asian morning Friday as a rush of computer-generated orders caught traders off guard. The sudden move started under $1.05 and algorithmic orders snowballed above that level, causing what little liquidity there was on the year’s last trading day to vanish, according to foreign-exchange traders. In minutes, Europe’s single currency jumped to a high of $1.0653, forcing some dealers to take losses to cover positions. And “It could be stops taken out in thin liquidity,” said Simon Pianfetti, a senior manager at the market solutions department at SMBC Trust Bank Ltd. in Tokyo. “But it’s still a big move.” An hour later, the currencies had pared gains and traders were swapping stories on who had come out ahead in dealing rooms. The euro was up 0.5 percent as of 6:14 a.m. in New York, while the franc was 0.4 percent higher. The yen had flipped to a 0.3 percent loss from a 0.4 percent advance. The sharp move in the world’s most-traded currency pair punctuated a year that’s seen several unexpected moments of extreme volatility, most notably the pound flash crash in October. Again in early Asia time, the British currency dropped more than 6 percent against the dollar in two chaotic minutes, exacerbated by a rush of computer-driven sell orders amid thin liquidity. There is concern that such price swings will become increasingly common, with Boston-based consultant Aite Group estimating algorithmic transactions have more than tripled in the past three years. Eoin Treacy's view Algorithmic trading systems have proliferated in an environment where computing power has reached the speed required to support the ambitions of traders. Ultralow rates and massive availability of liquidity have lent fuel to these kinds of programs. The result has been a marked uptick in market specific volatility where programs can profit from what I consider “stops arbitrage”. In much the same way that prior program traders found disparities in pricing between different exchanges, current programs can fish for stops around psychological levels.  Solar Panels Now So Cheap Manufacturers Probably Selling at Loss This article by Christopher Martin for Bloomberg may be of interest to subscribers. Here is a section: “Certainly it would be a challenge for anyone to make money at that price,” Osborne said in an e-mail. “The blended cost for most last quarter was about 36 cents to 38 cents.” The current price is also lower than cost estimates from Trina. The biggest supplier of 2015 expected to reduce costs to about 40 cents a watt by the end of the year, from 45 cents in the second quarter, Chief Financial Officer Merry Xu said in an August conference call. The Changzhou, China-based company’s shareholders on Dec. 16 agreed to a $1.1 billion deal to take the company private. A spokesman declined to comment Friday. Some companies’ cost structures remain competitive, even with prices this low. Canadian Solar Inc., the second-biggest supplier, reported costs of 37 cents in the third quarter, down from 39 cents in the second quarter. The company has said its costs are among the lowest in the industry, and it expects to reach 29 cents a watt by the fourth quarter of 2017. Many of its competitors expect costs in the low 30s by then, Osborne said. Eoin Treacy's view Producing solar cells in an environment where prices are falling and likely to continue to fall as new technologies are integrated into the manufacturing process is a highly competitive business. Companies unable to compete will go bankrupt and even the most successful face the threat of obsolescence. Consumers are the primary beneficiaries. Pharma's Pricing Troubles Will Get Worse in 2017 This article by Max Nisen for Bloomberg may be of interest to subscribers. Here is a section: A structural decline in U.S. pricing power is ominous for every pharmaceutical company -- particularly if it extends to brand-new drugs, or to areas, such as cancer, that traditionally have strong pricing power. Highly effective new cholesterol-lowering drugs from Amgen and Sanofi/Regeneron have had notably sluggish launches since being approved in 2015, as a result of cost-driven roadblocks to patient access. Meanwhile, the market for expensive, immune-boosting cancer drugs -- dominated by Merck & Co. Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. when 2016 began -- gained a new entrant this year in Roche Holding AG. Pfizer Inc. and AstraZeneca PLC may join next year. Having five similar drugs on the market would make pricing pressure all but inevitable. These trends quietly gathered strength in 2016, and 2017 will give us more of a sense of just how far they will go. This, regardless of what Donald Trump decides to do, could well be the defining biopharma story of the year. Eoin Treacy's view The pharmaceutical industry has led a charmed existence for a long time because it has been able to increase prices for legacy drugs because of little to no competition. It is the antithesis of what we see in the consumer electronics sector where price pressure is enormous and demand for constant improvements and ever lower costs is the norm. 2017 (the 48th year of The Chart Seminar) Eoin Treacy's view The Chart Seminar 2017 We are currently in the planning stages for choosing venues for The Chart Seminar next year. Here are the confirmed dates Singapore April 12th and 13th London November 16th and 17th We will provide venue details shortly. The CFA Institute has once more agreed to co-host the Singapore event and I will also provide certificates for continuous professional development to anyone who wants one. I now also have some copies of the Mandarin edition of Crowd Money so please specify which version you would like to receive at the seminar when booking. If you are interested in either of these venues or would like to suggest a venue please contact Sarah at [email protected]   I would be more than happy to plan a US based seminar next year if we have the critical mass to make it viable and I will be stopping off in Japan on the way back from the seminar in Singapore if there is any interest for an event in Tokyo. The full rate for The Chart Seminar is £1799 + VAT. (Please note US, Australian and Asian delegates, as non EU residents are not liable for VAT). Subscribers are offered a discounted rate of £850. Anyone booking more than one place can also avail of the £850 rate for the second and subsequent delegates.

Skip to content SAT Press Releases PR Distribution Menu HOME Submit the press release Our Team & Contact Posted on January 3, 2017 by Abhishek Budholiya Southeast Asia Pet Care Market Will Hit at a CAGR of 6.8% from 2014 to 2020 Future Market Insights (FMI) delivers incisive insights into emerging regions in its latest report titled, “Southeast Asia Pet Care  Market Analysis and Opportunity Assessment, 2014 – 2020”. The report states that the SEA pet care market is mainly driven by the burgeoning trends of pet humanization and increasing adoption of private label brands in countries such as Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia. FMI analyst P.S. Neha sheds light on why the SEA pet care market will become one of the major markets in the region in the near future: “Growth of the pet care market across Southeast Asia is driven by increasing adoption and humanization of pets. Pet owners are now more inclined towards more nutritious, healthy and organic foods for their pets.” By type, the overall SEA pet care market is segmented into dog food, cat food, pet products and others. Dog food is the major segment in this region, accounting for a 51.6% share of the market in 2014; however, this is expected to decrease by 30 BPS by 2020. Request For Report Sample@ http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-gb-45 This report also covers the pet care market by category and by channel. On the basis of channel, the market is segmented into supermarket, pet shop, veterinary clinic and others. The supermarket segment is the leading distribution channel in the SEA pet care market. However, veterinary clinics are anticipated to exhibit the fastest CAGR at 7.1%, followed by supermarket at a 6.8% CAGR during the forecast period. This growth is attributed to a shift in consumer buying habits and an increasing inclination of pet owners to purchase health and wellness products from reliable sources such as veterinary clinics. Furthermore, by category, the market includes economy-priced, mid-priced and premium-priced products. Improving consumer lifestyles and increasing disposable income in Southeast Asian countries has resulted in a growing acceptance for pets, not only among the high-income group, but also the middle-income group. In 2014, Thailand was the dominant country in the overall Southeast Asia pet care market with a 43.62% share, followed by Malaysia and Indonesia, accounting for 21.74% and 15.47% respectively. Send An Enquiry@ http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/askus/rep-gb-45 The pet care market in the Philippines is expected to register a significant CAGR of 8.4%. This is expected to be followed by Vietnam at a CAGR of 8.0% during the forecast period. Innovation remains the key to gaining a competitive edge in the SEA pet care market, especially in the pet food category. Companies such as Nestlé Purina, Zoetis, Mars, Inc. and Merck & Co., account for over 50% of the overall market share and constantly focus on mergers and acquisitions to expand their geographical presence and customer base.

The markets overcame early weakness and finished the day in positive territory. Trading activity was on the light side, with markets in the U.K. and the U.S. closed for the long New Year's Day holiday. Economic data was also on the light side Monday, but investors were presented with Eurozone PMI data as well as Chinese manufacturing data. The final Eurozone factory PMI was the highest score since April 2011. The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index is advancing 0.55 percent. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks is increasing 1.06 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major U.K. companies, is adding 0.31 percent. The DAX of Germany is climbing 0.90 percent and the CAC 40 of France is rising 0.47 percent. The FTSE 100 of the U.K. was closed and the SMI of Switzerland was also closed. In Frankfurt, Wirecard is increasing over 2 percent. The payments technology provider announced that Star Global Currency Exchange Private Limited, a group company, has got an upgrade of its license issued by Reserve Bank of India to be an authorized dealer in foreign exchange (category II). Commerzbank is climbing over 3 percent and Deutsche Bank is adding over 1 percent. Utility RWE is rising nearly 3 percent and rival E.ON is up almost 2 percent. In Paris, insurer AXA is gaining nearly 1 percent after announcing that it had completed the sale of Bluefin Insurance Group Ltd, its P&C commercial broker in the UK, to Marsh. Sanofi is advancing over 1 percent. The pharmaceutical firm and its vaccines global business unit Sanofi Pasteur have confirmed the end of their vaccine joint-venture with MSD (known as Merck & Co. Inc., in the United States and Canada). Alfa Laval AB is rising over 2 percent in Stockholm after winning an order to supply compact heat exchangers to a natural gas plant in the Middle East. Eurozone factory activity expanded the most since April 2011, final data from IHS Markit showed Monday. The final factory PMI rose to 54.9 in December from 53.7 in November. This was the highest score since April 2011 and unchanged from the flash estimate. Germany's employment increased for more than ten years in 2016, data from Destatis showed Monday. The number of persons in employment increased by 425,000, or 1 percent from the same period of the previous year. This was larger than an increase of 377,000 people, or 0.9 percent posted in 2015. Italy's manufacturing sector logged its strongest growth in six months in December, survey results from IHS Markit showed Monday. The factory Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 53.2 in December from 52.2 in November. This was the highest reading since June. China's factory activity and non-manufacturing operating growth slowed in December, survey data compiled by the China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing together with the National Bureau of Statistics showed Sunday. The official manufacturing PMI fell more-than-expected to 51.4 in December from 51.7 in November. The expected score was 51.5.

Analysts said sentiment was relatively upbeat at the prospects of tax cuts, regulatory reform and other initiatives that are expected to win favor in Washington under Trump and the Republican Congress. “Overall we ended 2016 with a great deal of optimism about stocks, even though the last week of the year was somewhat on a sideways move,” said David Levy, portfolio manager at Republic Wealth Advisors.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.6 percent at 19,881.76. The broad-based S&amp;P 500 gained 0.9 percent to 2,257.83, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.9 percent to 5,429.08. Ford jumped 3.8 percent after announcing plans to scuttle a new $1.6 billion factory in Mexico and instead create 700 new jobs in the US. The announcement was hailed by Trump, who had previously attacked the plan for the new Mexico factory. Ford’s rival, General Motors, won 0.9 percent after Trump threatened to impose tariffs on GM’s Mexican-built Chevy Cruze cars imported to the US. GM said most of its US-sold Cruze cars are built in America. Pharmaceutical stocks, which underperformed other sectors in 2016, advanced. Merck won 2.2 percent, Biogen 2.9 percent and Teva 3.4 percent. Restaurant shares tumbled after the NPD Group predicted that traffic will remain “stalled” in 2017, much as it did in 2016. McDonald’s lost 1.7 percent and Chipotle Mexican Grill fell 0.7 percent. jmb/hs © 1994-2017 Agence France-Presse Share this Story Related Stories Brazil’s Odebrecht, Braskem, Ordered to Pay $3.5 Billion in Bribery Case December 21, 2016 02:27 PM US Fed Raises Key Interest Rates as Economy Improves December 14, 2016 12:06 PM U.S. and European Stocks Soaring to Record-Breaking Highs, Reflects Growing Optimism December 7, 2016 03:35 PM Robert Vaughn, A.K.A.

The final factory PMI rose to 54.9 in December from 53.7 in November. This was the highest score since April 2011 and unchanged from the flash estimate. While the strong end to 2016 is encouraging news, the manufacturing revival clearly remains vulnerable to political risk, Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said. Shares opened on a subdued note earlier in the session as data out of China showed the pace of growth in China's manufacturing and services sectors slowed in December. The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index was up 0.46 percent at 363.10 in late opening deals after closing 0.3 percent higher on Friday. The German DAX was moving up 0.8 percent and France's CAC 40 index was rising 0.3 percent while the London market was closed for the New Year holiday. Alfa Laval AB advanced 1.5 percent in Stockholm after winning an order to supply compact heat exchangers to a natural gas plant in the Middle East. Wirecard shares rose about 1 percent. The German payments technology provider announced that Star Global Currency Exchange Private Limited, a group company, has got an upgrade of its license issued by Reserve Bank of India to be an authorized dealer in foreign exchange (category II). French Insurer AXA edged up 0.7 percent after announcing that it had completed the sale of Bluefin Insurance Group Ltd, its P&C commercial broker in the UK, to Marsh. Sanofi shares gained 1 percent. The French pharmaceutical firm and its vaccines global business unit Sanofi Pasteur have confirmed the end of their vaccine joint-venture with MSD (known as Merck & Co. Inc., in the United States and Canada). by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Market Analysis Trump Takes Power, Manufacturing In Focus -- Economic Preview For Week of January 16 Lazy, or Inefficient?
