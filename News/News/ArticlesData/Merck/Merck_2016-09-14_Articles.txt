LATEST MEDICAL NEWS Meeting Coverage Second Chance for Cladribine? More safety data, growing risk tolerance may signal opportunity MedpageToday savesaved by Kristina Fiore Kristina Fiore Associate Editor, MedPage Today September 15, 2016 LONDON -- Data from a pair of extension trials have bolstered the long-term safety and efficacy of oral cladribine for relapsing multiple sclerosis, researchers reported here. In an extension phase of the CLARITY trial, reductions in annualized relapse rates (ARR) were maintained, while patients who switched from placebo had reduced relapse rates (0.26 to 0.10, P<0.0001), Gavin Giovannoni, MBBCh, PhD, of Queen Mary University of London, reported at the ECTRIMS meeting here. And in an extension phase of the ORACLE-MS trial of patients with a first demyelinating event, those who ultimately went on to develop MS and started taking interferon had lower relapse rates if they'd been given cladribine in the initial trial instead of placebo (0.14 for 3.5 mg/kg and 0.24 for 5.25 mg/kg versus 0.42), Giancarlo Comi, MD, of Università Vita-Salute San Raffaele in Milan, reported here. The findings are part of a large package that Merck KGaA, the company's German manufacturing unit, will use to try to have the drug approved in Europe for relapsing-remitting MS, following a rejection by EU regulators in 2010. It submitted a marketing authorization package with the EMA on July 18. The FDA denied approval of cladribine for MS in March 2011, and the company halted its development program in June 2011. Merck KGaA did not respond to a MedPage Today inquiry as to whether it also planned to file an NDA with the FDA. While regulators were initially concerned about an increase in malignancies with the drug, several other agents with comparable adverse event profiles have been approved since that time -- and the company is reassured that additional analyses show few safety concerns and an appropriate risk-benefit ratio. "In our field over the last 5 or 6 years, there's been approval of other, more powerful medications, so this is now in the context where we have, for instance, alemtuzumab with its risks that patients are willing to take on," said Stephen Krieger, MD, of Mount Sinai, who was not involved in the study. "We have a more nuanced understanding of Tysabri and PML and that risk that people are willing to take on." "It's a somewhat different climate in terms of what risk-benefit ratio is acceptable for a medication thought to have high efficacy," Krieger said. Cladribine is a chemotherapeutic agent that targets white blood cells and is used to treat certain blood cancers. Merck developed a pill formula for treating MS. At ECTRIMS, there were two oral presentations and more than a half a dozen posters on the drug, which included data from CLARITY and ORACLE-MS and their respective extensions, as well as from the phase II ONWARD study which looked at the drug as an add-on to interferon. Giovannoni reported data from the 2-year extension phase of the CLARITY trial, in which patients initially on placebo were switched to 3.5 mg/kg cladribine, while those on the drug were re-randomized to either 3.5 mg/kg or to placebo. He reported no significant differences in ARR during the extension phase compared with the initial phase, except for a reduction among those who switched from placebo (from 0.26 to 0.10, P<0.0001). The proportion of patients who were relapse-free was similar in both groups at greater than 70%, but it improved for those who switched from placebo to 3.5 mg/kg of the drug (58% versus 79.6%, P<0.0001). Giovannoni said the findings demonstrate the durable efficacy of cladribine, adding that there were no benefits of additional cladribine treatment. In the ORACLE-MS study, cladribine reduced conversion to MS compared with placebo (38% versus 14% for 3.5 mg and 16% for 5.25 mg), and the extension phase enabled the 109 patients who converted to MS to be treated with interferon (25 on cladribine 3.5 mg/kg; 24 on 5.25 mg/kg; 60 on placebo). In an exploratory analysis for the open-label period, they found that annualized relapse rates were lower among those originally treated with cladribine compared with those who got placebo at enrollment: 3.5 mg/kg: 0.14 (95% CI 0.00-0.27) 5.25 mg/kg: 0.24 (95% CI 0.07-0.40) Placebo: 0.42 (95% CI 0.28-0.56) However, Comi cautioned that few patients completed the full 2 years of the extension phase: 7 in the placebo group, 2 in the 3.5-mg group, and 6 in the 5.25 mg group. In a separate poster that focused on assessing safety data from CLARITY and ORACLE-MS and their respective extensions, as well as the PREMIERE registry, researchers found that rates of lymphopenia were higher for those on the 3.5 mg dose of the drug than placebo (8.8 versus 1.16 per 100 person-years). The analysis also showed that herpes zoster was reported more frequently in patients who had Grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia. And the rate of neoplasms, both malignant and benign, was similar but numerically slightly higher for the 3.5-mg drug group than the placebo group (1.14 and 1.01), the researchers said, adding that there was "no clustering of malignancies with a common etiology, and no hematological malignancies commonly associated with immunosuppression." Should the drug be approved, the question remains as to where it fits into the current treatment landscape. Krieger noted that it may also be more likely to be adopted in Europe, which has historically been more tolerant of induction therapy -- compared to the U.S., in which escalation therapy is typically preferred. "Europeans have always historically used more potent immune-suppressing medications for MS: alemtuzumab for 20 years, mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide, rituximab off-label," he said. "They are more comfortable with that approach to MS than doctors in the U.S." The studies were supported by Merck KGaA. Comi and Giovannoni disclosed financial relationships with several MS drugmakers. 2016-09-15T11:30:00-0400 Primary Source ECTRIMS Source Reference: Comi G, et al "Cladribine tablets in the ORACLE-MS study open-label maintenance period: Analysis of efficacy in patients after conversion to clinically definite multiple sclerosis" ECTRIMS 2016; Abstract 70.

AgWired Animal Ag Precision Energy AgNewsWire ZimmComm Navigation Subscribe Advertise About Subscribe Advertise About FARM Program, Merck Offer Animal Health Webinars FARM Program, Merck Offer Animal Health Webinars Lizzy Schultz September 14, 2016 Facebook Twitter Email Print The Farmers Assuring Responsible Management (FARM) Program , which is administered by the National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF), has announced that it is teaming up with Merck Animal Health to offer a series of animal health webinars that will further build upon the strong partnership established last year between the Merck Dairy Care365 Program and the FARM Program. This decision comes after last summer’s announcement that NMPF and Merck Animal Health would collaborate to help ensure a comprehensive, dairy industry-wide approach to employee training and animal care. This partnership has given dairy producers across the country unprecedented access to the tools, resources and workshops available through the Merck Animal Health Dairy C.A.R.E. Initiative, and it will also produce 10 upcoming webinars on various animal care topics, including calf care, stockmanship, antimicrobial stewardship and more. “Merck’s proactive, engaging partnership has greatly strengthened the FARM Animal Care Program and we are grateful for their support for the program again this year,” said NMPF Chief of Staff Emily Meredith, who also leads the FARM Program. “These webinars, hosted by Merck Animal Health and leading animal health and welfare experts, will provide valuable training resources to producers and their employees.” “Dairy C.A.R.E. was developed to help producers provide the best animal care by maintaining sound policies, hiring the right people and making sure they are properly trained – and our partnership with NMPF is a natural fit,” said Rick Jackson, Merck Animal Health U.S. dairy product manager. “The new webinar series helps us meet our goal of offering supplemental materials dairy farmers can use to meet the new requirements under FARM Version 3.0 while supporting the significant efforts of dairy producers to continuously improve the care and handling of their animals.” The video topics and release dates are available here.

The objective of the DiViNe project is to create an integrated, cost-effective purification programme specifically tailored for vaccines that achieves higher yields while preserving product integrity. Mercks specific focus will be on simplifying the process of vaccine purification that typically relies on affinity chromatography, a method of capturing antibodies. In support of this goal, the company will be providing chromatographic materials and coupling technologies. 'Purification steps represent significant manufacturing costs for most biological drugs,' said Udit Batra, CEO of the life science business at Merck KGaA. 'In targeting these inefficiencies we have an excellent opportunity to drastically improve rates of recovery. 'As an industry leader in chromatography, we look forward to contributing our expertise to the DiViNe consortium, helping to identify process efficiencies and supporting expanded access to affordable vaccines.' The DiViNe projects integrated purification platform will first be tested with diverse, heterogeneous vaccines, including glycoconjugates, protein antigens and viruses. Once validated with vaccines, the consortium plans to implement its purification platform in downstream processes for other biologics, including recombinant proteins, gene therapy vectors and blood products. Merck will be joined in the consortium by Affilogic (France), Aquaporin (Denmark), GenIbet Biopharmaceuticals (Portugal) and GlaxoSmithKline (Italy). The project will be co-ordinated by iBET (Portugal) and has received funding from the EUs Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme.

The company has recently engaged with multiple global partners to support faster and more cost-effective development of new vaccines needed to fight diseases like Ebola, Zika and influenza. Other projects - such as DiViNe - aim to simplify manufacturing processes, making them more amenable to technology transfer to developing countries. Together, these vaccines initiatives will help expand access to high-quality healthcare, especially in low- and middle-income countries.

effective purification program - Company to provide chromatographic expertise News provided by Merck KGaA Sep 14, 2016, 08:00 ET Share this article DARMSTADT, Germany, Sept. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, a leading science and technology company, has joined the DiViNe project, a European consortium of six companies to address the biggest challenges facing the development, manufacture and delivery of vaccines. The objective of the DiViNe project is to create an integrated, cost-effective purification program specifically tailored for vaccines that achieves higher yields while preserving product integrity. Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany's specific focus will be on simplifying the process of vaccine purification that typically relies on affinity chromatography, a method of capturing antibodies. In support of this goal, the company will be providing chromatographic materials and coupling technologies. Continue Reading Merck KGaA is lending its expertise in chromatography to the DiViNe Consortium, a group of six companies working to develop a more efficient purification platform for vaccines. "Purification steps represent significant manufacturing costs for most biological drugs," said Udit Batra, CEO of the life science business at Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. "In targeting these inefficiencies we have an excellent opportunity to drastically improve rates of recovery. As an industry leader in chromatography, we look forward to contributing our expertise to the DiViNe consortium, helping to identify process efficiencies and supporting expanded access to affordable vaccines." The DiViNe project's integrated purification platform will first be tested with diverse, heterogeneous vaccines including glycoconjugates, protein antigens and viruses. Once validated with vaccines, the consortium plans to implement its purification platform in downstream processes for other biologics, including recombinant proteins, gene therapy vectors and blood products. Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany will be joined in the consortium by Affilogic (France), Aquaporin (Denmark), GenIbet Biopharmaceuticals (Portugal) and GlaxoSmithKline (Italy). The project will be coordinated by iBET (Portugal) and has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement N° 635770. The DiViNe project is part of the company's larger vaccine initiative focusing on the biggest challenges around vaccines: costs, speed, accessibility and delivery. The company has recently engaged with multiple global partners to support faster and more cost-effective development of new vaccines needed to fight diseases like Ebola, Zika and influenza. Other projects – such as DiViNe – aim to simplify manufacturing processes, making them more amenable to technology transfer to developing countries. Together, these vaccines initiatives will help expand access to high-quality healthcare, especially in low- and middle-income countries.

Now, the hard work begins to make the combination a success. Bayer-Monsanto follows agrichemical deals between Dow Chemical Co. and DuPont, as well as ChemChina-Syngenta AG. Completion of the merger would leave three companies with more than 75 percent of the global market, according to data compiled by Bloomberg -- a level of concentration sure to set off alarm bells with regulators. The combination also faces a public backlash in Germany over concerns about Monsanto’s genetically modified seeds and weedkiller -- both abhorred in Bayer’s home country. In a sign of how protracted the regulatory review of the new seed and crop-chemical giant will be, the companies said they will seek approval in 30 jurisdictions around the world -- including the U.S., European Union, Canada and Brazil -- and don’t expect to complete the deal until the end of 2017. Monsanto shares closed 20 percent below the offer price on Wednesday over concerns from investors that the deal might not succeed. German companies have a checkered history with mega acquisitions abroad, including Daimler AG’s ill-fated purchase of Chrysler in 1998 for $43 billion -- a stand-out symbol for failed ventures overseas. Another reminder of the difficulties such deals face came just this week when Linde AG’s talks to merge with U.S. rival Praxair Ltd. fell apart over squabbling about the role of the German company’s Munich home base following a combination. Still, mid-tier companies in the country have been forging ahead with foreign acquisitions that garner less attention. ZF Friedrichshafen AG has done so well with the $12.9 billion purchase of U.S. parts supplier TRW Automotive Holdings Corp. last year that it’s already on the hunt for new targets. ZF is currently bidding to buy Sweden’s Haldex AB. And Bayer has proven itself as one of the most aggressive acquirers among German companies. In addition to the gutsy Monsanto bid, it won fierce bidding wars to buy rival Schering AG, creating the country’s largest drugmaker in 2006, and Merck & Co.’s consumer unit in 2014. Here are five other deals that Bayer and Monsanto might want to study as they move forward. Deutsche Telekom AG-VoiceStream Wireless Corp. (2000 - $50.5 billion): Deutsche Telekom AG store Photographer: Ralph Orlowski/Bloomberg This deal at the dawn of the new millennium gave the German telephone company a splashy entry into the U.S. wireless market. But it also came with headaches, as mobile phone improvements were taking off and competition between carriers was fierce. Deutsche Telekom has only recently begun to turn around what became T-Mobile USA Inc. after a sale to Sprint Corp. was blocked by regulators. Daimler AG-Chrysler Corp. (1998 - $43 billion): Daimler Mercedes-Benz badges Photographer: Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg Considered one of the most disastrous deals in corporate history, there was a huge culture clash between the German manufacturer of the luxury Mercedes Benz brand and the U.S. maker of mass market cars like the Chrysler Sebring that led to this merger’s downfall. After nine years spent trying to make things work, the automakers’ marriage broke down: Daimler sold Chrysler to Cerberus Capital Management in 2007 for just $7.4 billion. HeidelbergCement AG-Hanson Ltd. (2007 - $18 billion): HeidelbergCement operations Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg This deal was the largest in the building materials industry that year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One looming problem that might not have been on HeidelbergCement’s radar when it bought its U.K. competitor: the housing market was about to crash under the weight of subprime mortgages, leading to a slump in construction projects and stripping the company of its investment-grade credit rating. HeidelbergCement didn’t return to major deal-making until 2015, when it agreed to buy Italcementi SpA for 3.7 billion euros ($4.2 billion.) Merck KGaA-Sigma-AldrichCorp. ($16 billion): Merck KGaA laboratory Photographer: Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg A happier story: Family-controlled Merck continued a tradition of acquisitions with the purchase of the U.S. firm to expand in chemicals used in research labs and pharmaceutical manufacturing, as well as reducing its dependence on drug development. The German company last month reported second-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates, buoyed by the acquisition of the pharmaceutical equipment maker. Before that it successfully acquired and integrated Millipore Corp., a supplier of drug development equipment for biotechnology companies in 2010, and AZ Electronic Materials SA in 2013 to strengthen its specialty chemicals to the electronics industry. Linde AG-BOC (2006 - $15.6 billion): Linde gas tanks Photographer: Guido Krzikowski/Bloomberg Linde’s takeover of its larger British rival in manufacturing industrial gases is used as the case study for successful acquisitions in MBA programs. The unsolicited bid in 2006 vaulted the German company to the world’s biggest maker of industrial gasses from No. 5, in what CEO Wolfgang Reitzle called "a perfect match" at the time. Reitzle, now Linde’s chairman, has faced a very different scenario this week following the collapse of the Praxair talks, which had gotten underway in earnest in August. Following the announcement Monday that the potential deal had fallen apart, Chief Financial Officer Georg Denoke was ousted and Chief Executive Officer Wolfgang Buechele said he wouldn’t seek to extend his contract beyond April. Linde could revisit a merger with Praxair down the road because the strategic rationale remains intact, people familiar with the matter have said. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The rest of the market is, however, fragmented and is characterized by the presence of several large and small players. Transparency Market Research notes that the rivalry within the animal healthcare industry is quite high due to the existence of a large number of players and this trend is also reflected in the global poultry pharmaceutical market. “The high degree of competition ensures that poultry pharmaceutical companies maintain regular interaction and collaborations with drug retailers, governments, and poultry farmers,” the author of the study states. The revenue generated by the global poultry pharmaceuticals market was pegged at US$3.7 bn in 2015 and is projected to reach US$7.8 bn by 2024, registering a healthy CAGR of 8.5% during the forecast period. Interpret a Competitive outlook Analysis Report with free PDF Brochure: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_id=11486 Product innovation has also proven to be a successful strategy adopted by players in the poultry pharmaceutical market, TMR finds. For instance, in September 2015, Merial Animal Health globally launched its innovation in poultry vaccination technology, known as Merial Avinew. This move has strengthened Merial’s position in the market. North America and Latin America Emerge as Most Promising Markets for Poultry Pharmaceuticals  By type of product, vaccines held the leading share in the global poultry pharmaceuticals market in terms of revenue, accounting for just over 41% in 2016. Feed additive medications, on the other hand, will register an 8.8% CAGR during the forecast period, emerging as a highly lucrative product segment. Based on type of animal, chicken is the key contributor to the overall market and is likely to remain so through 2024. The segment will also register a higher growth rate than any other category. Geographically, while North America dominates the global poultry pharmaceutical market, accounting for just short of 36% in 2016, Latin America is forecast to clock in the highest CAGR of 9.2% from 2016 to 2024. View exclusive Global Strategic Business report: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/poultry-pharmaceuticals-market.html Rising Poultry Franchises in Emerging Nations a Key Growth Driver  The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in the U.S states that the demand for food is expected to double due to the increase in global population, which is projected to be around 9.1 billion by 2050. In order to cater to this ever-rising demand for food, the number of poultry farming operations and franchises has increased significantly in recent years. China, Brazil, Mexico, India, Russia, and Argentina are among the leading countries with a high growth rate in terms of poultry animal ownership. This has benefited the poultry pharmaceutical market. Apart from this, the poultry pharmaceuticals market is fueled by the growing emphasis on wellness and preventive care by veterinarians and poultry animal owners, the rising consumption of animal protein, the increasing incidence of poultry diseases, and the support from government and private organizations in the form of vaccination initiatives. In contrast, the poultry pharmaceutical market is hampered by stringent regulations, lengthy product approval periods, and limited vaccination production. The growing concerns regarding the use of antibiotics and growth promoters in animal feed are also hindering the growth of the global market. This review is based on the findings of a TMR report titled “Poultry Pharmaceuticals Market – (By Product – Drugs, Vaccines, Feed Additive, and Medication; By Animal Type – Chicken, Turkey, Duck, Goose, and Others) – Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecast 2016 – 2024.” Browse Global Industry PR:  http://www.europlat.org/poultry-pharmaceuticals-market.htm Global Poultry Pharmaceuticals Market, by Product Type  – Drugs – VETRIMOXIN – Other Drug Products – Vaccines – INNOVAX – NOBILIS – Poulvac – Other Vaccine Products – Feed Additive Medication – VIGOSINE – Amnovit – Other Feed Additive Medication Global Poultry Pharmaceuticals Market, by Animal Type  – Chicken – Turkey – Duck – Goose – Others Global Poultry Pharmaceuticals Market, by Geography  – North America – U.S. – Canada – Europe – U.K. – Germany – Rest of Europe – Asia Pacific – China – India – Rest of Asia Pacific – Latin America – Brazil – Rest of Latin America – Middle East & Africa – South Africa – Rest of Middle East & Africa Browse Other Latest Research Reports:   – Companion Animal Vaccines Market: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/companion-animal-vaccines-market.html – Small Animal Imaging Market: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/small-animal-imaging.html – U.S. Pet Medication Market: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/us-pet-medication-market.html About Us:  Transparency Market Research (TMR) is a U.S. based provider of syndicated research, customized research, and consulting services.

The rest of the market is, however, fragmented and is characterized by the presence of several large and small players. Transparency Market Research notes that the rivalry within the animal healthcare industry is quite high due to the existence of a large number of players and this trend is also reflected in the global poultry pharmaceutical market. "The high degree of competition ensures that poultry pharmaceutical companies maintain regular interaction and collaborations with drug retailers, governments, and poultry farmers," the author of the study states. The revenue generated by the global poultry pharmaceuticals market was pegged at US$3.7 bn in 2015 and is projected to reach US$7.8 bn by 2024, registering a healthy CAGR of 8.5% during the forecast period. Interpret a Competitive outlook Analysis Report with free PDF Brochure: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_id=11486 Product innovation has also proven to be a successful strategy adopted by players in the poultry pharmaceutical market, TMR finds. For instance, in September 2015, Merial Animal Health globally launched its innovation in poultry vaccination technology, known as Merial Avinew. This move has strengthened Merial's position in the market. North America and Latin America Emerge as Most Promising Markets for Poultry Pharmaceuticals  By type of product, vaccines held the leading share in the global poultry pharmaceuticals market in terms of revenue, accounting for just over 41% in 2016. Feed additive medications, on the other hand, will register an 8.8% CAGR during the forecast period, emerging as a highly lucrative product segment. Based on type of animal, chicken is the key contributor to the overall market and is likely to remain so through 2024. The segment will also register a higher growth rate than any other category. Geographically, while North America dominates the global poultry pharmaceutical market, accounting for just short of 36% in 2016, Latin America is forecast to clock in the highest CAGR of 9.2% from 2016 to 2024. View exclusive Global Strategic Business report: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/poultry-pharmaceuticals-market.html Rising Poultry Franchises in Emerging Nations a Key Growth Driver  The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in the U.S states that the demand for food is expected to double due to the increase in global population, which is projected to be around 9.1 billion by 2050. In order to cater to this ever-rising demand for food, the number of poultry farming operations and franchises has increased significantly in recent years. China, Brazil, Mexico, India, Russia, and Argentina are among the leading countries with a high growth rate in terms of poultry animal ownership. This has benefited the poultry pharmaceutical market. Apart from this, the poultry pharmaceuticals market is fueled by the growing emphasis on wellness and preventive care by veterinarians and poultry animal owners, the rising consumption of animal protein, the increasing incidence of poultry diseases, and the support from government and private organizations in the form of vaccination initiatives. In contrast, the poultry pharmaceutical market is hampered by stringent regulations, lengthy product approval periods, and limited vaccination production. The growing concerns regarding the use of antibiotics and growth promoters in animal feed are also hindering the growth of the global market. This review is based on the findings of a TMR report titled "Poultry Pharmaceuticals Market - (By Product - Drugs, Vaccines, Feed Additive, and Medication; By Animal Type - Chicken, Turkey, Duck, Goose, and Others) - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecast 2016 - 2024."

My dad will start Keytruda regimen on Friday, $15,000 per infusion, once every three weeks indefinitely.” The high cost of pharmaceuticals had hit home! Her 61-year-old father, Jim McCallister, who lives in Spartanburg, S.C., had been diagnosed with a melanoma discovered during a routine skin exam a few weeks earlier. It had spread to his lungs. Doctors recommended the drug, which uses the body’s immune system to attack cancer cells and has showed promise in treating aggressive melanomas. McCallister’s employer-provided insurance is paying for most of his treatment, and the family is looking into Merck’s co-pay program. In the meantime, McCallister faces several thousand dollars of out-of-pocket costs. McCallister may be lucky cost-wise. But the fact remains: Somebody is paying for the high cost of Keytruda and other new drugs coming on the market. Sausser said her dad asked if insurance would cover the drug. “The doctor told him they would find some way.” That’s the nub of the dilemma. For many like McCallister, there may be help, often from the drug companies themselves in the form of patient assistance plans. Remember drug company AstraZeneca’s ads for some of its costly drugs: “AstraZeneca may be able to help”? Sometimes state or local government programs, private charities, nonprofit agencies, or coupon programs help patients pay for their drugs. Patients who can’t get help from any of those sources often go without. None of the assistance programs, however, attack the underlying prices for the drugs, which pharmaceutical makers can set according to what the market will bear. They can pretty much do whatever they want with little push back from those who end up paying the bills – governments, insurers and patients. The U.S. has no cost controls, and government doesn’t negotiate drug prices the way many other countries do. So the price of commonly prescribed drugs like the EpiPen, a shot that stops life-threatening allergic reactions, has risen to more than $600 for two pens. In 2009 two pens cost $100. The price for Abilify, an antipsychotic, has risen 113 percent between 2007 and 2014, and the cholesterol-lowering drug Crestor has climbed 103 percent over the same time period, according to The Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing, a group of employers, insurers and unions that are trying to raise public awareness of high drug prices. That helps explain why Medicare recently reported its spending on prescription drugs increased more than 17 percent in 2014 even though the number of claims from the program’s 38 million beneficiaries rose only 3 percent. Medicare’s prescription drug law was never meant to pay all a person’s drug expenses. This year once a beneficiary and her drug plan have paid $3,310 for medicines, she reaches the coverage gap where she must pay the cost of most of her drugs. If she spends, out of her own pocket, another $4,850 for drugs this calendar year, she qualifies for catastrophic coverage and pays only 5 percent of all her remaining drugs for the year. The trouble is that with prices so high, it’s easy to end up in the coverage gap paying out-of-pocket. Even protection offered by catastrophic coverage may not be enough. That’s especially true for people taking high-priced specialty drugs. In 2013, about 3 million people were in this predicament. “Not a lot of people pay above the threshold, but those who do can pay through the nose,” says Tricia Neuman, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation. Escalating drug prices affect everyone – even those not taking expensive drugs or not on Medicare. High drug prices affect all insurance premiums sooner or later. Not long ago I spotted a letter to the editor in USA Today from Heather Block, age 53 who has Stage 4 breast cancer. She was calling for patients to organize and build a network to help craft solutions for the problem of skyrocketing drug prices. I talked to Block about this. Her zeal and interest in organizing patients reminded me of the early days of the consumer movement in the 1960s when citizens organized to pass legislation to make the marketplace safer and more fair. With drugs, Block says, it’s hard to organize people because of drug assistance programs that take the sting out of prices and make patients less willing to work against the companies, the presence of disease advocacy groups funded by the pharmaceutical industry and a general reluctance to speak up for fear of jeopardizing their own health and survival. She’s asking for consumers to share their stories at this email: h3ath3rblock@gmail.com. What problems are you having paying for prescription drugs? Write to Trudy at trudy.lieberman@gmail.com.

LATEST MEDICAL NEWS Meeting Coverage HIV Drug Fails in Small MS Trial Casts doubt on novel theory of MS etiology MedpageToday savesaved by John Gever John Gever Managing Editor, MedPage Today September 15, 2016 LONDON -- A drug trial intended to validate a novel theory of multiple sclerosis -- that it has its roots in ancient retroviral sequences embedded in the human genome -- came up short, researchers said here. Patients treated with the HIV drug raltegravir (Isentress), which could suppress expression of retroviral elements, showed no differences in brain MRI lesion counts after treatment compared with a pre-treatment baseline phase, reported Monica Marta, MD, PhD, of Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry. "The overall results for both primary and secondary outcomes are negative, with no apparent statistically significant outcome or trends for the treatment phase," she said in a poster presentation at the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis annual meeting. But the study doesn't disprove the so-called HERV (human endogenous retrovirus) theory of MS, due to the trial's many limitations, and testing of another group's treatment approach based on the theory is proceeding. This line of research originated with some of the first analyses of the fully sequenced human genome, which showed that a surprising amount -- up to 8% of the entire sequence -- appeared to encode retroviral proteins such as helicase and integrase enzymes like those found in HIV. These were initially considered "junk DNA" but subsequent studies showed that these sequences could be expressed under the right circumstances. Some of these HERV proteins have been isolated from MS brain lesions. As well, links have been documented between Epstein-Barr virus infection (itself linked previously with MS risk) and induction of HERV expression. And, separately, it has been noted that individuals with established HIV show a markedly lower rate of MS than the general population. Some researchers speculated that it is not the HIV infection that is responsible for the apparent protective effect, but rather -- since these observations were made in developed countries -- from antiretroviral treatment. All of these observations have come together to suggest that therapies aimed at HERV expression might affect MS risk and/or the disease course. The Barts and the London group, headed by Gavin Giovannoni, MBBCh, PhD, obtained support from Merck, which agreed to provide raltegravir for the 20-patient, 6-month study. When the trial was announced, Giovannoni told MedPage Today that it had not been easy to find support from HIV drug manufacturers because none of them have a presence in MS therapeutics and were therefore mostly uninterested in committing significant funds to such a trial. That, as much as anything, dictated the choice of drug and the size and scope of the trial, he said. The 20 patients, who were required to show evidence of MRI lesion activity at baseline, first underwent a 3-month observation period during which additional MRI brain scans were performed monthly. They then received raltegravir at 400 mg twice daily for 3 months while continuing to receive monthly scans. The primary outcome measure was the number of gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions seen after treatment versus the observational period. Secondary outcomes included new or enlarging T2 lesions and clinical measures of relapses and disability. No differences or even encouraging trends were seen between the treatment and observational phases, either for the primary outcome or for any of the secondary endpoints, Marta reported. Co-principal investigator Julian Gold, MBBS, of Queen Mary University here, told MedPage Today that the study was probably doomed by its limitations: the choice of raltegravir versus other anti-HIV agents as well as its use as monotherapy (HIV patients typically receive multidrug combinations) may not have achieved actual suppression of HERV elements. The small number of patients and short study duration also limited the researchers' ability to detect treatment effects. Asked what the next steps could now be, given these negative results, he replied, "I don't know." Gold said the lucrative market for current MS drugs appeared to be dissuading companies from searching for alternatives that get to the condition's actual cause. He pointed to another trial he is involved with in motor neuron disease, for which a major pharma company is providing substantial support. That has not existed for the use of anti-HIV drugs, he said, even though a secondary analysis of the raltegravir trial data confirmed that HERV protein expression correlated with MS lesion counts. "It's really a shame," he said. But this is not the only test of the HERV theory underway. Another group based in Switzerland has also been pursuing a direct anti-HERV strategy, employing a monoclonal antibody called GNbAC1 that binds to a particular expressed HERV protein. Sponsored by Geneva-based GeNeuro SA, a phase 2b study is now underway and has enrolled half of its projected 260 patients with relapsing-remitting MS, the firm said in a press release. As in the raltegravir trial, its primary outcome measure is T1 lesion counts assessed over 6 months. However, secondary outcomes will include clinical measures to be evaluated at 48 weeks. Multiple drug doses will be tested as well. Participants must have had at least one relapse in the past year or show at least one gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesion in the past 3 months. A pilot trial of GNbAC1, reported in spring of 2014, found that the drug stabilized lesion counts in patients with established MS. Giovannoni has conducted research on behalf of Merck Serono (unrelated to Merck). Other investigators in the raltegravir trial reported no competing interests. 2016-09-15T13:30:00-0400 Primary Source ECTRIMS Source Reference: Marta M, et al "Phase 2 baseline versus treatment clinical trial of the HIV drug raltegravir in patients with active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis: The INSPIRE study results" ECTRIMS 2016; Abstract P447. 0 comments Next More in Meeting Coverage Two RA Agents Similar in Head-to-Head Trial Novel HCV Drug Combo Shines in CKD Patients AHA: Does a C-Section Delivery Put Baby at Risk for Obesity?

HbA1c improved by 0.7 percentage points with the lower 5 mg dose and by 0.8 percentage points with the higher dose compared with placebo on a background of metformin and the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor sitagliptin (Januvia), both significant at P<0.001 for the primary endpoint at 26 weeks. Those were "clinically meaningful reductions," Brett Lauring, MD, PhD, of drug developer Merck in Kenilworth, N.J., and colleagues reported here at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes meeting. Secondary endpoints also showed significant differences from placebo for the following: Weight was lower by 2.0 and 1.7 kg, or 4.4 and 3.7 lb, for the 5-mg and 15-mg dose groups, respectively More participants reached the less than 7% HbA1c goal at week 26 (32.1% lower dose and 39.9% higher dose versus 17.0%) Fasting plasma glucose was lower by 1.4 and 1.7 mmol/L, 25 and 31 mg/dL, respectively Systolic blood pressure came in 2.9 and 3.9 mm Hg lower with the two doses, respectively With three SGLT2 inhibitors already available, one member of the audience questioned why develop yet another. "With more agents, there's more choice on the marketplace for patients," answered Lauring, who added that differences have emerged among agents in some classes, like the DPP-4 drugs, and it's possible that the large cardiovascular outcomes trial program with ertugliflozin will be required to see if there is such a difference in the SGLT2s too given the "pretty compelling efficacy with this agent." Also, a fixed dose combination is attractive for patients, he added, having noted that "SGLT2 and DPP-4 inhibitors have differing, complementary mechanisms of action, and additive efficacy is expected." Clifford J. Bailey, PhD, of Aston University in Birmingham, England, called the findings "consistent with effects of other members of class" but cautioned that it's "not possible to make specific comparisons with other members of the class in other studies as populations and other aspects of the studies will differ." The VERTIS SITA2 trial included 263 type 2 diabetes patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1c of 7.0% to 10.5%) on metformin dosed at 1,500 mg/day or greater and sitagliptin at 100 mg/day. They were randomized to the addition of ertugliflozin at either 5 or 15 mg or placebo for 26 weeks. Adverse event rates were not higher overall with the drug than placebo, but there were more events deemed treatment related with both doses (10.9% and 14.4% versus 8.5%) and more discontinuations with the lower dose only (5 cases, 3.2%, versus one in the other groups, 0.7% each). Of the events of interest based on what has been seen with other SGLT2 inhibitors, there was a fairly high rate of genital mycotic infection in women (12.7% with the higher dose and 8.0% with the lower dose versus 1.9% with placebo, P<0.05) and a similar trend in men (3.7% and 4.9% versus 0.0%). Urinary tract infections occurred in 4.6% of the higher dose, 2.6% of the lower dose, and 2.0% of the placebo groups. Symptomatic hypoglycemia occurred in just 0.7% of the higher dose group but 3.8% of the lower dose and 2.6% of the placebo groups. "SGLT2 inhibitors are known to result in transient reductions in eGFR," Lauring noted. "And that's what we saw. There were reductions on order of 2 mL/min, which returned to baseline by week 26." There have also been associations with increases in LDL cholesterol but in the study "we didn't observe meaningful differences." Two other pivotal trials in the VERTIS series also reported positive results recently, in presentations at the American Diabetes Association meeting this year: VERTIS Mono with ertugliflozin as monotherapy against placebo and VERTIS Factorial, showing greater reductions in A1C with the ertugliflozin-sitagliptin combination than with ertugliflozin or sitagliptin alone. Merck and Pfizer have announced plans to file for FDA approval of ertugliflozin and two fixed-dose combinations (ertugliflozin plus sitagliptin and ertugliflozin plus metformin) by the end of this year. The study was conducted and funded by Merck and Pfizer. Lauring and all but one of the co-authors were employees of Merck or Pfizer. Reviewed by Henry A.

Over the 2015-2022 forecast period, the South-East Asia T2DM therapeutics market is expected to increase in value at a CAGR of 7.1%, from $1.7 billion to over $2.7 billion. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Therapeutics in South-East Asia Markets to 2022 states that as well as the rapidly expanding prevalence population in South-East Asia, market growth will be driven by the increased uptake of recently approved and emerging branded T2DM therapeutics, in favor of lower-cost generic products. One of the publishers analysts states that: Unmet needs relating to patient convenience and ease of use will be addressed significantly over the forecast period. Higher levels of innovation are apparent in the early-stage pipeline, which may lead to considerable improvements beyond the existing range of products, in terms of safety and efficacy in the long term. In terms of recently approved therapeutics, GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP-4 inhibitors, and SGLT-2 inhibitors have already achieved strong market uptake and are all expected to increase their market shares over the forecast period. In comparison with many previously marketed therapies, these new products provide improved weight control and lowered hypoglycemia risk. In terms of late-stage pipeline products with the potential to change the treatment paradigm, six candidates stand out as offering superior safety, efficacy, and patient compliance. These are Novo Nordisk's NN-9535 (semaglutide subcutaneous formulation) and OG-217SC (semaglutide oral formulation) and Eli Lilly's Trulicity (dulaglutide), which are GLP-1 receptor agonists; Merck's ertugliflozin and Theracos's bexagliflozin, which are SGLT-2 inhibitors; and Merck's omarigliptin, which is a DPP-4 inhibitor.

The drug “controlled the most common form of the disease better than a rival’s medicine and worked against another form of MS for which there is no approved treatment,” reported Reuters. Investigators in charge of this study used Merck’s Rebif as the comparison drug in this trial to test its efficacy against Ocrevus for patients diagnosed with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) or primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). RMS patients exhibited no evidence of disease activity over the course of two years, according to Roche’s statement. A combination of clinical and MRI outcomes were used to test the efficacy of this drug throughout the study period. The endpoint was achieved when an RMS patient didn’t experience relapses, progression of disability, or have new or enlarging MRI lesions. Furthermore, PPMS patients didn’t display any signs of disease progression at 47 percent higher rate when compared to placebo, wrote Reuters. “With no approved treatment options, primary progressive MS remains a challenge for physicians and people with MS,” said Xavier Montalban, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Neurology and Neuroimmunology at Vall d’Hebron University Hospital, Research Institute and Cemcat, Barcelona, Spain. “Ocrevus significantly impacted three key disability measurements, which further highlight its clinical significance in people with primary progressive MS,” Montalban added. PPMS has no approved treatment yet so this data could bolster Roche’s case that it has a blockbuster on its hands. Ocrevus sales could reach about $3.8 billion by 2022. The company will present more detailed data this week at the 32nd Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis in London, England.

In a phase III study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, Shingrix showed a 90% efficacy in adults aged 70 and older that was maintained for four years. Importantly, Shingrix demonstrated a greater level of protection for elderly patients than the rival Merck & Co vaccine. Shingles is a painful rash that develops as a result of the reactivation of the latent chickenpox virus. Complications from the virus intensify with age and can include scarring, vision problems and chronic pain. A person's risk for shingles increases sharply after 50 years of age. “If approved, this candidate vaccine could be an important tool for the prevention of shingles and the pain associated with it, which would significantly impact the health and quality of life of so many people,” said senior vice president Emmanuel Hanon. GSK said it expects to start submitting regulatory applications for its 50+ vaccine later this year. Analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald said the publication of a more detailed analysis was “reassuring” and confirmed its view that it could be a “class leading vaccine”. The broker said it expected first revenues for the product by 2018. Cantor forecast a prospective dividend yield of 4.8%, maintaining its “hold” recommendation and target price of 1700p. --UPDATE ADD BROKER COMMENT-- Share Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version Josh Allsopp Register here to be notified of future GSK Company articles View full GSK profile GlaxoSmithKline plc Timeline Video October 27 2016 GlaxoSmithKline shares are outperforming AstraZeneca Newswire October 27 2016 GlaxoSmithKline medicine goes down well in City Article October 24 2016 GSK seeks US green light for shingles vaccine Article October 20 2016 A solid, defensive play for yield investors, but just what could sink GSK?

CEO Of EpiPen Maker Mylan To Face Congressional Hearing Next Week Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share CEO Of EpiPen Maker Mylan To Face Congressional Hearing Next Week Image courtesy of M September 14, 2016 12:31 pm EST By Chris Morran@themorrancave a little oversight epipen Mylan heather bresch drugs teva In recent weeks, members of both the House and Senate have raised questions about the soaring price of — and potential antitrust concerns surrounding — emergency allergy treatment EpiPen. A congressional committee confirmed this morning that it will soon hold a hearing on the issue, and that Heather Bresch, CEO of EpiPen maker Mylan, has been called to testify. The House Oversight Committee will hold the hearing — titled “Reviewing the Rising Price of EpiPens” — on Wed. Sept. 21 at 10 a.m. ET. Bresch — whose father is Joe Manchin, current U.S. Senator from West Virginia and former governor of that state — is expected to be joined by Dr. Doug Throckmorton, the FDA’s Deputy Director at the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. Mylan has come under fire for raising the price on EpiPen — a critical emergency treatment for anaphylaxis — by as much as 600% since acquiring the drug when it purchased Merck’s generics division nearly a decade ago. “There is justified outrage from families and schools across the country struggling to afford the high cost of EpiPens,” reads a joint statement from committee Ranking Member Rep. Elijah Cummings (GA) and committee Chair Rep. Jason Chaffetz (UT). “We look forward to receiving answers next week from Mylan about its dramatic price hike for this life-saving medication.” The price issue wouldn’t be so contentious is there was sufficient competition in the marketplace. Reps. Chaffetz and Cummings say the committee will “examine ways to encourage greater competition in the EpiPen market and to speed FDA’s approval of acceptable new generic applications.” One lower-price competitor, AdrenaClick, is not as widely available and some pharmacies that do stock the product charge around the same price as they do for EpiPen. Mylan has announced plans for a generic version of EpiPen, but the sticker price on a two-pack of the drug would still be $300. Teva Pharmaceuticals has been working on a competing product, but the FDA rejected this application in February for “major deficiencies.” However, Teva recently stated that it hopes to address those concerns and get its EpiPen alternative on the market by 2018. Some emergency medical technicians have taken to creating their own Epi-Kits that provide them with everything they need to treat a patient in an emergency — at a cost of only around $20 each. Lawmakers have also raised potential antitrust concerns regarding the EpiPen4Schools program, which provides participating schools with some of the epinephrine injectors at a discount price, but which also appears to prohibit these schools from purchasing any products that compete with EpiPen. The New York attorney general’s office has already confirmed that it is investigating this issue. Meanwhile members of congress and consumer advocates — including our colleagues at Consumers Union — have called for a federal antitrust investigation.

Listeria monocytogenes is a bacterial pathogen capable of causing severe infections in humans, often with fatal outcomes. According to USFDA, published studies suggest that 1- 8% of humans may be intestinal carriers of Listeria. According to Unites States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Listeria causes about 280 cases of illness in newborns in a typical year, resulting in 60 deaths and stillbirths. Infants can be infected before birth, and this infection can cause serious disability in newborns. About 35 infants are disabled as a result of infection from Listeria each year. The key factors assisting the growth of Listeria monocytogenes infections treatment market are rise in prevalence of foodborne diseases, stringent laws and policies issued by FDA, rising demand for healthy and microbial-free food, and high public awareness related to foodborne diseases in developed countries.

A 75 percent higher proportion of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients reached "no evidence of disease activity" status with Ocrevus in a head-to-head trial against Merck's Rebif, Roche said in a statement. Additionally, doctors found no evidence of disease progression in a 47 percent higher proportion of primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) patients compared with a placebo. There are no approved treatments for PPMS. More on this... How one neurologist diagnosed with multiple sclerosis is using his experience to treat MS patients Using chemo to treat MS shows 'remarkable' promise Social networking site connects multiple sclerosis patients Earlier this year, Roche accelerated its timeline for Ocrevus approval, saying it could come in 2016 after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave it fast-track review status. Analysts estimate Ocrevus, whose generic name is ocrelizumab, could generate annual sales of nearly 4 billion Swiss francs ($4.09 billion) by 2022, according to Thomson Reuters data. "These new data suggest that ocrelizumab consistently impacts disease progression and has the potential to change how we approach treating both relapsing and primary progressive MS," Gavin Giovannoni, who heads up neurology at The London School of Medicine and Dentistry and is on the committee leading the Roche study, said in the statement. Ocrevus is among several new drugs that Roche hopes can offset patent expiries among older medicines that will leave it more vulnerable to competition from cheaper generic or biosimilar medicines. About 85 percent of those diagnosed with MS suffer from relapsing-remitting MS, while 10 percent suffer from primary-progressive MS. Roche is presenting more detailed findings from the Ocrevus studies, called Opera I and Opera II, at an MS conference in London this week.

  LONDON, Sept. 15, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The Global Co-development Partnering Terms and Agreements in Pharma, Biotech and Diagnostics 2010-2016 report provides comprehensive understanding and unprecedented access to the co-development deals and agreements entered into by the worlds leading life science companies. This report provides details of the latest Co-development agreements announced in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic sectors. Fully revised and updated, the report provides details of Co-development agreements from 2010 to 2016. There is an increasing willingness for parties to enter co-development deals; such deals enable both parties to benefit from the upside of a big product win, whereas traditional licensing deals forfeit upside for near term upfront, milestone and royalty payments. Co-development partnering allow the parties to securitize value and reduce risk, but keep a part of the potential upside should the product reach the market. Event if the licensor does not commercialize the project they can either sell those rights to the licensee partner or another partner for an amount higher than would have been achieved at an earlier stage licensing deal. There are mainly two forms of co-development deals; Either the parties agree on a certain division of ownership, or decide that one party gets the rights to commercialise the drug in a certain geographical area, and the other side gets the other geographical area rights. Typically, the ownership division applies when it is likely that the project will be licensed at a later point in time. The geographical split usually applies when the two companies are determined to commercialise the drug themselves. Another reason for co-development deals is the joint origin of a project. Drug development projects often require various scientific and technological novelties that stem from different companies. If both companies contributed to the origination of the project, then both have from the beginning a stake in the project. Understanding the flexibility of a prospective partner's negotiated deals terms provides critical insight into the negotiation process in terms of what you can expect to achieve during the negotiation of terms. Whilst many smaller companies will be seeking details of the payments clauses, the devil is in the detail in terms of how payments are triggered – contract documents provide this insight where press releases and databases do not. This report contains a comprehensive listing of Co-development deals announced since 2010 as recorded in the Current Agreements deals and alliances database, including financial terms where available, plus links to online copies of actual Co-development contract documents as submitted to the Securities Exchange Commission by companies and their partners. Contract documents provide the answers to numerous questions about a prospective partner's flexibility on a wide range of important issues, many of which will have a significant impact on each party's ability to derive value from the deal. The initial chapters of this report provide an orientation of Co-development dealmaking and business activities. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the report, whilst chapter 2 provides an overview and analysis of the trends in Co-development as well as a discussion on the merits of the type of deal. Chapter 3 provides an overview of the structure of Co-development deals. The chapter includes numerous case studies to enable understanding of both pure Co-development deals and multicomponent deals where Co-development forms a part. Chapter 4 provides a review of the leading Co-development deals since 2010. Deals are listed by headline value. Where the deal has an agreement contract published at the SEC a link provides online access to the contract via the Current Agreements deals and alliances database. Chapter 5 provides a comprehensive listing of the top 50 most active Co-development dealmaker companies. Each deal title links via Current Agreements deals and alliances database to an online version of the full deal record, and where available, the actual contract document, providing easy access to each deal record on demand. Chapter 6 provides a comprehensive review of co-development financials for deals announced since 2010, including headline value, upfront, milestone payments and royalty rates, providing both benchmark data and access to individual deal financials. Chapter 7 provides a comprehensive and detailed review of Co-development deals organized by company A-Z, therapy, technology and industry type signed and announced since 2010 where a contract document is available. Contract documents provide an indepth insight into the actual deal terms agreed between the parties with respect to the Co-development deal. The appendices to the report includes a comprehensive listing of all Co-development deals announced since 2010. Each listing is organized as an appendix by company A-Z, stage of development at signing, therapeutic area and industry type. Each deal title links via hyperlink to an online version of the deal record including, where available, the actual contract document.

Led by the Gates Institute with support from Bayer, 120 Under 40 recognizes and highlights the achievements of the next generation of family planning leaders worldwide. Over the course of this multi-year project, 120 young family planning champions will be highlighted, 40 in each of the three project years. This year’s 40 winners are journalists, medical doctors and service providers, advocates, researchers, and founders of nonprofits. They work all over the world—in clinics and universities, in offices, and in the field—to advance family planning and reproductive health. In Ethiopia, Minister of Health Kesetebirhan Admasu has championed the country’s highly successful Health Extension Network, which improves the quality and availability of primary health care services—especially family planning and reproductive health—through community-based health workers. In India, Vithika Yadav is providing accessible, non-judgmental information on sexual and reproductive health and rights through the digital platform Love Matters India. From the United States, Turkey native Burcu Bozkurt co-leads the International Youth Alliance for Family Planning, a global network of 50-plus country coordinators working to amplify and empower the voices of young family planning and reproductive health advocates. The 40 winners for 2016 were chosen through public online voting, scoring by a jury of experts and leaders in family planning, and the project secretariat. The winners each receive $1,000 from the Gates Institute to continue their work in family planning. “We were thrilled by the caliber of the nominees in this first year of 120 Under 40, and these 40 winners are truly an outstanding group,” says Jose “Oying” Rimon II, Director of the Gates Institute and chair of the 120 Under 40 Jury. “With these young leaders at the helm, the family planning movement and its commitment to protecting health and saving lives are in excellent hands.” A smaller representative group of winners have been invited to attend the 120 Under 40 celebrations in the United States from September 21 to 23. These celebrations, which coincide the United Nations General Assembly meetings in New York, will include training in advocacy and leadership, meetings with influential leaders, and opportunities for the winners to share personal stories about their passion for family planning and reproductive health. The activities will be co-hosted in Baltimore, Washington DC, and New York City by the Gates Institute, Bayer, Population Council and the FP2020 partnership. Year one of 120 Under 40 officially concludes on World Contraception Day, September 26, an annual day of observance organized by Bayer to focus international attention on contraception, especially young people’s need to access contraceptive and reproductive health information, services and supplies. The 2016 winners of 120 Under 40 are as follows (full bios of the winners are available upon request): Dr. Kesetebirhan Admasu, Ethiopia Minister Federal Ministry of Health Rose Aduful, Ghana Senior Nursing Officer/Public Health Nursing Reproductive Health Centre, Korle bu Teaching Hospital Dr. Priya Agrawal, United Kingdom Executive Director, Vaccines & Women’s Health Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp.

Embargoed until 4 p.m. ET, Thursday, Sept. 15 ORLANDO, Florida, Sept. 15, 2016 – Abnormalities in a type of cell involved in blood vessel development and healing may explain why adults who were born prematurely are at increased risk of high blood pressure and other heart alterations, according to new research presented at the American Heart Association’s Council on Hypertension 2016 Scientific Sessions. Researchers at the University of Montreal compared the function of endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) – which help maintain healthy blood vessels – taken from 30 young adults (21-28 years old) born very preterm (less than 29 weeks gestation) and 30 young adults born at term (37 or more weeks gestation). Among the findings: In lab tests, the cells from preterm adults were slower to form colonies, a key step in forming new capillaries; In preterm adults, slower colony formation was associated with two risk factors of heart disease, a higher systolic (top number) blood pressure and enlargement of the heart’s left pumping chamber. Abnormal function of ECFCs has also been associated with early complications of preterm birth. For example, prolonged oxygen therapy exposure and consequent development of lung disease.

This report provides details of the latest Co-development agreements announced in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic sectors. Fully revised and updated, the report provides details of Co-development agreements from 2010 to 2016. There is an increasing willingness for parties to enter co-development deals; such deals enable both parties to benefit from the upside of a big product win, whereas traditional licensing deals forfeit upside for near term upfront, milestone and royalty payments. Co-development partnering allow the parties to securitize value and reduce risk, but keep a part of the potential upside should the product reach the market. Event if the licensor does not commercialize the project they can either sell those rights to the licensee partner or another partner for an amount higher than would have been achieved at an earlier stage licensing deal. There are mainly two forms of co-development deals; Either the parties agree on a certain division of ownership, or decide that one party gets the rights to commercialise the drug in a certain geographical area, and the other side gets the other geographical area rights. Typically, the ownership division applies when it is likely that the project will be licensed at a later point in time. The geographical split usually applies when the two companies are determined to commercialise the drug themselves. Another reason for co-development deals is the joint origin of a project. Drug development projects often require various scientific and technological novelties that stem from different companies. If both companies contributed to the origination of the project, then both have from the beginning a stake in the project. Understanding the flexibility of a prospective partner's negotiated deals terms provides critical insight into the negotiation process in terms of what you can expect to achieve during the negotiation of terms. Whilst many smaller companies will be seeking details of the payments clauses, the devil is in the detail in terms of how payments are triggered – contract documents provide this insight where press releases and databases do not. This report contains a comprehensive listing of Co-development deals announced since 2010 as recorded in the Current Agreements deals and alliances database, including financial terms where available, plus links to online copies of actual Co-development contract documents as submitted to the Securities Exchange Commission by companies and their partners.

The initial chapters of this report provide an orientation of Co-development dealmaking and business activities.

LONDON, Sept. 15, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The Global Collaborative R&D Partnering Terms and Agreements in Pharma, Biotech and Diagnostics 2010-2016 report provides comprehensive understanding and unprecedented access to the collaborative R&D deals and agreements entered into by the worlds leading life science companies. This report provides details of the latest collaborative R&D deals announced in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic sectors. Fully up to date with the latest information, the report provides details of collaborative R&D deals from 2010 to 2016. There has been a long standing willingness for parties to enter collaborative R&D deals. Such deals enable both parties to benefit from the upside of a big R&D win, whilst mitigating the risks of going it alone in the risky preclinical and clinical development stages. Collaborative R&D is a specific type of partnering deal whereby the parties to the deal agree to collaborate on the research and development and subsequently commercialize a compound, product or technology. There are several forms of a collaborative R&D deal; A traditional collaborative R&D arrangement whereby an owner of intellectual property (the licensor) provides access to its technology to another company (the licensee) in return for agreed payments and royalties on subscequent sales of product(s) derived from the intellectual property. In more recent times, licensing is often the outcome of a successful period of collaborative R&D on the research and development of a technology or compound, resulting in a product which can be commercialized. In this situation, the collaborative R&D agreement governs who has permission to commercialize and what payments are due should commercialization proceed. The report provides a detailed understand and analysis of how and why companies enter collaborative R&D deals. The majority of deals are multicomponent whereby the licensee retains either a right or option to license to comoercialize the resultant product of the research collaboration. There are also numerous pure licensing deals whereby the products originator takes on a development/commercialization partner in order to maximize a technologies/products prospects. Understanding the flexibility of a prospective partner's negotiated deals terms provides critical insight into the negotiation process in terms of what you can expect to achieve during the negotiation of terms. Whilst many smaller companies will be seeking details of the payment clauses, the devil is in the detail in terms of how payments are triggered – contract documents provide this insight where press releases and databases do not.

This report provides details of the latest collaborative R&D deals announced in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic sectors. Fully up to date with the latest information, the report provides details of collaborative R&D deals from 2010 to 2016. There has been a long standing willingness for parties to enter collaborative R&D deals. Such deals enable both parties to benefit from the upside of a big R&D win, whilst mitigating the risks of going it alone in the risky preclinical and clinical development stages. Collaborative R&D is a specific type of partnering deal whereby the parties to the deal agree to collaborate on the research and development and subsequently commercialize a compound, product or technology. There are several forms of a collaborative R&D deal; A traditional collaborative R&D arrangement whereby an owner of intellectual property (the licensor) provides access to its technology to another company (the licensee) in return for agreed payments and royalties on subscequent sales of product(s) derived from the intellectual property. In more recent times, licensing is often the outcome of a successful period of collaborative R&D on the research and development of a technology or compound, resulting in a product which can be commercialized. In this situation, the collaborative R&D agreement governs who has permission to commercialize and what payments are due should commercialization proceed. The report provides a detailed understand and analysis of how and why companies enter collaborative R&D deals. The majority of deals are multicomponent whereby the licensee retains either a right or option to license to comoercialize the resultant product of the research collaboration. There are also numerous pure licensing deals whereby the products originator takes on a development/commercialization partner in order to maximize a technologies/products prospects. Understanding the flexibility of a prospective partner's negotiated deals terms provides critical insight into the negotiation process in terms of what you can expect to achieve during the negotiation of terms. Whilst many smaller companies will be seeking details of the payment clauses, the devil is in the detail in terms of how payments are triggered – contract documents provide this insight where press releases and databases do not. This report contains a comprehensive listing of all collaborative R&D deals announced since 2010 as recorded in the Current Agreements deals and alliances database, including financial terms where available, plus links to online copies of actual collaborative R&D contract documents as submitted to the Securities Exchange Commission by companies and their partners.

The initial chapters of this report provide an orientation of collaborative R&D dealmaking and business activities. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the report, whilst chapter 2 provides an analysis of the trends in collaborative R&D as well as a discussion on the merits of the type of deal.

Is It Stress or a Stroke? Common Stroke Symptoms Silent Stroke: Hard to Recognize F.A.S.T. Test for Stroke Signs Font Size A A A Minorities Less Likely to Get Clot-Busting Drug But study couldn't determine why white male patients were more likely to get tPA in hospital WebMD News from HealthDay By Steven Reinberg HealthDay Reporter WEDNESDAY, Sept. 14, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- A clot-busting drug known as tPA can greatly improve stroke outcomes, but it isn't given to minorities nearly as often as it is given to white men, a new U.S. study shows. Blacks were 26 percent less likely, and other minority patients were 17 percent less likely, to be treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) than white men, the researchers found. In addition, women were 8 percent less likely to be given the clot buster than men. "It is helpful to get a sense of what factors are associated with not treating patients with this proven therapy," said lead researcher Dr. Steven Messe. He is an associate professor of neurology at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Although Messe isn't sure why these disparities exist, he thinks "it is possible that this has already improved in more recent years." The drug is given after an ischemic stroke, which is caused by a blood clot in the brain; tPA dissolves the clot and restores blood flow to the blocked vessel. It cannot be used for a stroke caused by bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke). "Given that tPA has been demonstrated to improve neurologic outcome after stroke, we should be treating all eligible patients," Messe said. To this end, he said, patient education about stroke symptoms and what to do when a stroke is suspected is needed, as well as continued development of stroke centers. "Hopefully, we can continue to improve treatment rates overall by addressing some of these issues," Messe said. The study was funded in part by Pfizer Inc., and the Merck Schering-Plough Partnership. For the study, Messe and his colleagues looked at the eight-year period between 2003 and 2011 to see how many patients who arrived at a hospital within two hours after a stroke were given tPA. All of the patients were eligible to get the drug, the researchers said. Of the nearly 62,000 people in the study, more than 15,000 (25 percent) did not receive tPA within three hours, the findings showed. 1 | 2 Next Page > Continue reading below...

"Following" : "Follow"}} September 15, 2016 10:54am   Comments Share: Related BAX Stocks Hitting 52-Week Highs Earnings Scheduled For October 25, 2016 Tracking Dan Loeb's Third Point Portfolio - Q3 2016 Update (Seeking Alpha) Barclays reinstated coverage of Baxter International Inc (NYSE: BAX) with an Overweight rating and $52 price target as it sees upside to long-term growth and margin targets. Since spinning off the Baxalta biopharma business in May 2015, the company has delivered a series of beats and raises due to its focus on R&D investment in the medtech business and better cost controls. Baxter expects 2020 operating margin (OM) of 17-18 percent (unlevered), driven by cost savings, new products, and portfolio management. Barclays noted that post-spinoff, Baxter raised its long term targets by 350 bps at the midpoint, and topped its initial 2016 guidance by 200 bps (current 12 percent vs. initial 10 percent OM). "Organically, we think BAX can top this goal and using the balance sheet could add to OM and EPS," analyst Matthew Taylor wrote in a note. Taylor expects the solid MSD growth to continue and should come from key products such as Sigma Spectrum, PD cyclers, CRRT, anesthesia, and biosurgery. Further, the company has other growth/margin accretive assets including pharma, anesthesia, and nutrition. "While we understand the valuation pushback on BAX, we think investors are missing the medium-term margin and M&A potential, along with the strength of BAX's new products, which we think will resolve this disparity," Taylor added.

Minyanville Bayer AG (ADR) (BAYRY) Makes the Monsanto Deal Work By Scutify Sep 15, 2016 9:12 am PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. Bayer AG (ADR) (OTCMKTS:BAYRY) rose 3% in early Wednesday trade after its $66 billion, $128-per-share bid for Monsanto Company (NYSE:MON) was accepted. Top executives appeared on TV to say they expect regulators to approve it, and Bayer stock was lifted in response. Monsanto stock barely reacted to the deal on Wednesday morning, still hovering near the pre-bid price of $107, a value of $46.2 billion. That is doubtless due to the regulatory juggernaut that Bayer's deal still has to go through, with both European and American agencies showing increased skepticism toward big deals of any sort. The deal would consolidate a global farming chemical-and-seed business at a time of global glut in farm commodities. I drove through the Midwest several times in the last month, and the corn really was as high as an elephant's eye, the soybeans super-abundant in the fields. This is thanks in large part to genetically-modified seed and fertilizers made by Monsanto. But if it goes through, expect good things from Bayer and BAYRY stock. The Terms of the Deal The terms of the deal, announced in a press release, include $19 billion in new Bayer stock, in the form of mandatory convertible shares with subscription rights, and $47 billion in cash, to be financed through a $57 billion bridge loan which has already been obtained. 4 Vanguard Funds I'll Never Sell Buying these Vanguard funds was one of the most profitable decisions of my life. And they can change your life, too! You'll find their names & complete details in my latest Special Report. It's yours FREE, online here! If the deal falls through, Monsanto gets a $2 billion break-up fee. 10 Growth Stocks That Will Outrun Google The price is 44% more than Monsanto was worth in May, and 19% above the $106 per share it was worth before the deal was announced. Assuming the deal does go through, the shareholders are going to do very well. The question becomes whether there can be big farming profits in a world of GMO, and whether BAYRY can capture them at the hefty price it is paying. The answer, of course, is yes. Making It Work What is working with grains can work with other agricultural commodities. Genetic engineering is really just an acceleration in the cross-breeding technology we have been using for centuries, techniques we've been using on cats and dogs for millennia. Ironically, Bayer becomes the largest player in GMOs at a time when the German government is among the most skeptical in the world about them. Before this deal, Bayer was basically a medical company. The soccer team it launched in 1904 still has a Bayer aspirin tablet on its club shield. Its drugs include Cipro, Levitra, Xarelto and the Yaz line of birth control products. It's more heavily involved in consumer products, like Aleve, Claritin, One-a-Day, and in and animal health products like Advantix. Regulators may protest that Monsanto makes GMOs a two-way race between Bayer, a German company, and Syngenta AG (ADR) (NYSE:SYT), whose sale to ChemChina is now being finalized. Monsanto would give Bayer a market cap north of $130 billion - hefty, but still well short of pharmaceutical giants like Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Johnson & Johnson Inc. (NYSE:JNJ). That's part of the hope here - that Monsanto's roughly $15 billion in annual sales, and $3.5 billion in net income, can deliver to Bayer the financial kick it needs to play in those big leagues of drug discovery. This deal would more than double Bayer's sales, and triple its net income. However, it may take up to two years to close, and would meanwhile occupy all of management's time. More Deals On The Way Given the price, and what this does to the Bayer balance sheet, it seems inevitable that more deals are going to follow this one. The whole crop unit could become a new company, the consumer health units might be sold, or the pharmaceutical units could go on the market. Either way, it's going to be interesting times for Bayer shareholders. My personal view is it's going to be a profitable time, that the combined company, and its pieces, are going to be worth a lot more in two years than they are now.

The report on enhancing global access to medicines released on 14 September is likely to generate much protest from big pharmaceutical companies and from governments of some rich countries. The findings, however, come as a respite to global health activists who have been striving for a much greater role of the state in bringing drug prices to affordable levels. The UN High-Level Panel (HLP) for Access to Medicines urges governments to "urgently" increase their current levels of investment in health technology innovation, to enter into negotiations for a binding R&D treaty that de-link costs of innovation from the end prices of drugs and to globally prioritise research for diseases whose needs are unmet. Representational image. Reuters Another very important recommendation, that if implemented could change the whole paradigm of the issue of access to medicine, is the attempt by the panel to make drug prices transparent — of the costs of developing the drugs as well as marketing, distribution and advertising — to the government and the consumers. “With the taxpayer effectively paying twice for health technologies in terms of R&D grants and/or tax breaks as well as the end costs for the technology, the report recommends a paradigm shift in transparency to ensure that the costs of health technology R&D, production, marketing and pricing,” the UN states. The true cost of developing a new drug now is estimated to be anything between $150 million and $4 billion per medicine. The recommendations are unlikely to go down well with Washington. Michelle Lee, Director of the US Patent and Trademark Office on 13 September said that the panel has a "narrow focus" and a "biased mandate". The US official had promised to take "appropriate steps" after reviewing the report. Significantly, it also attacks powerful western governments for the "implicit threats" that they sometimes use to bully poorer countries from exercising their legitimate right in overriding drug patents under World Trade Organisation’s (WTO’s) Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) flexibilities rules. On 19 November last year, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon announced the creation of a high level panel on innovation and access to health technologies for "remedying the policy incoherence" between the rights of inventors, international human rights law, trade rules and public health in the context of health technologies. The 15-member panel consisted of innovators, leaders of the pharmaceutical industry, public health, human rights and international law experts, civil society and government, under the leadership of former Swiss president Ruth Dreifuss and the former president of Botswana Festus Mogae. The panel also had eminent Australian jurist Michael Kirby, generic-making giant Cipla’s chairman Yusuf Hamied, GlaxoSmithKline chief executive Andrew Witty, renowned economist Sakiko Fukuda-Parr, among others. James Love, an internationally-renowned health activist, who devised the $1 per day HIV/AIDS regime that saved, and continues to save, millions of lives in Africa, said that the over-reliance on high drug prices to incentivise innovation reduces access significantly. "The most important recommendation from the UN experts is to delink the cost of R&D from the prices of drugs. You cannot rely upon high drug prices to finance R&D without harming patients and creating unequal access," Love said in a statement after the release of the report. He referred to all the recommended measures on transparency and encouraging countries to license patents to generic companies in developing countries as “important and useful”. The idea of delinkage is based on the premise that incentives created by patents for pharmaceutical innovation through charging high prices cannot be the only way to finance innovation. “The normal type of tax payers money is not the only way to finance global public goods," Fukuda-Parr said. "The voice of Indian generic drugs was 'very well heard' in our high-level panel — to avoid obstacles to the timely entry of generic drugs," Dreifuss told a group of international journalists in a telebriefing after the release of the report. Representational image. Getty Images "That's going to be something that the government of India is going to have to consider when it gets the report and see how the report operates on the not inconsiderable generic drug manufacturing industry of India. That is something which is beneficial to the world. But it is also beneficial to India," Kirby said responding to a journalist’s question on whether the Indian government expressed concerns to the HLP on being pressured to not use their TRIPS-flexibilities entitlements. The current market innovation model of funding R&D has failed on many counts: it is ill-equipped to respond to the increasing emergence of infectious diseases, such as Ebola and Zika, there is a big gap in research in diseases that have a heavy burden like non-communicable diseases, there is a looming problem of investment in neglected tropical diseases and dealing with superbugs because of the not-so-big returns for pharmaceutical companies from such investments. Yellow fever and Ebola virus — that killed thousands in west Africa — had health technologies in the process of development abandoned midway due to the lack of incentives for pharmaceutical companies, Malebona Precious Matsoso, director-general in the national health department of South Africa, and a panelist on the HLP said. According to 2009-10 data, of the $240 billion investment in health R&D, 60 percent comes from the private sector, 30 percent from public sector and 10 percent from non-profit sector. Also, of $240 billion, a whopping 89.5 percent of the investment is from the rich countries, 7.9 percent from the upper-middle income countries, a negligible 2.6 percent from low-income countries like India, and 0.1 percent from low-income countries. Therefore, currently, pharmaceutical companies from rich countries forming powerful lobbies have a disproportionate influence on drug prices and access issues. The report also engages extensively with free trade agreements (FTAs) that have proliferated in the past decade increasingly covering huge geographical swathes and involving large chunks of the global economy. These trade deals contain expensive patents and data protection clauses on health technologies, thereby blocking access to such technologies. The way in which intellectual property laws and trade deals have worked through the system, the unaffordability of high-priced drugs is not the sole concern of the poorer governments anymore — the global north as well as the south have been struck by the diminished capabilities of governments to deliver the right to health to their citizens. "And because these are global in nature, a single national government cannot deal with these issues," Fukuda-Parr said. An issue, therefore, that consumed much energy of the HLP was: "How we can ensure that the flexibilities that were envisaged in the TRIPS agreement and in the Doha Declaration should be observed and honoured. [Because] Unfortunately, that has not been happening," said Kirby. The report cites two examples where powerful governments have arm-twisted countries to stop them from using compulsory licensing provisions — Thailand’s 2006 decision to import generic versions of the antiretroviral medicine Efavirenz from India under compulsory licence was met with hostility and ensuing retaliatory measures from the US government, the European Trade Commissioner and from the manufacturer Merck. Similarly, various foreign parties issued covert threats to the Colombian government for its decision of issuing compulsory licensing for Imantib — a drug for treatment of leukemia which is on WHO’s essential medicines list. So-called TRIPS Plus agreements that lie beyond the purview of the WTO are inserted into FTAs thus making weaker governments suffer the consequences from countries asserting their IP laws. The UN has asked countries to complain to the WTO if they are prevented from using TRIPS flexibilities. "One of the key recommendations of the report is that this should not happen and countries that threaten and retaliate against others for using their entitlements under the TRIPS agreements, face significant, serious sanctions for doing so. That requires collaboration by WTO which is not an UN agency as such," Kirby added. The UN special rapporteur on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order Alfred de Zayas on 13 September urged the UN Human Rights Council to ensure the mainstreaming of human rights into trade agreements and WTO practice. It is unclear if this will happen in the near future. The panel also spent much time debating if countries should be encouraged to implement a system of compulsory licensing in national legislation that is "effectively automatic". Though majority of panel members were in favour of such a recommendation, a "sizeable minority" objected to its inclusion for its "potential incompatibility of such measures with the TRIPS agreement and the unintended consequences that may result from such an approach". Witty, the sole representative from the big pharmaceutical industry on the HLP, expectedly, called compulsory licensing as a "serious issue of concern" and expressed strong doubts about the implementation of the proposed R&D treaty given the fact that governments would require billions of dollars to make this work. "The threat is coming really from the weakness of WTO now in front of the member states who are now developing their own regional and bilateral FTAs. So this is not a matter of goodwill, I would say, from the WTO — it is a matter of weakness of WTO after the failure of concluding the Doha round… many of these bilateral and regional trade FTAs do not [have] the same power on two sides of the table," the former Swiss president said. Regardless of the challenges in implementing the recommendations of this important report, the UN’s voice in affirming the right to health is a shot in the arm for activists and governments struggling to deliver life-saving drugs to the dying millions.

Jim Cramer is willing to be called crazy. In the past few weeks, Cramer's charitable trust has built a new pharmaceutical position in its portfolio for Bristol-Myers Squibb. "The drug company I have referenced for years as the kind of high-quality secular growth business that is totally immunized against the slings and arrows of the Federal Reserve or a slowing economy," the "Mad Money" host said. Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images Coumadin medication by Bristol-Myers Squibb on pharmacy shelf in Princeton, Illinois. "To me, at these levels, it just screams value, even as you might have to wait a while for this investment to pay off." -Jim Cramer Bristol-Myers shares have fallen more than 26 percent in the past two months. On Aug. 5, the stock plunged 16 percent, wiping out $20 billion in value in a single session on news that its flagship oncology drug, Opdivo, failed to meet its primary endpoint in a clinical trial for advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The news set back the company's most important drug and prompted analyst downgrades and estimate cuts. "To me, at these levels, it just screams value, even as you might have to wait a while for this investment to pay off," Cramer said. Opdivo is already available commercially and helps patients' immune systems' T-cells fight cancer more effectively. The drug has grown dramatically, as it generated nearly $1 billion in sales in 2015 and more than $1.5 billion for the first 6 months of 2016. As soon as investors heard that the drug failed to meet its primary endpoint, Wall Street turned its back on the whole franchise, assuming that people would switch to a competitor like Merck's Keytruda. However, Cramer said the drug did not meet goals because Bristol-Myers set the bar too high. When it designed the clinical trial, it included patients who expressed a specific protein by more than 5 percent — a very low level. Why circle back to the stock now? Cramer's charitable trust bought the stock because Opdivo estimates have now gone from too high to too low, now that most analysts have stripped the non-small lung cancer numbers from estimates. Additionally, the company has another non-small cell lung cancer trial to pair Opdivo with another of its drugs. If that trial goes well, estimates will need to be raised. "Let's not act like Bristol-Myers is some one-drug wonder biotech firm," Cramer said. It has a host of drugs that treat a variety of diseases, and sports a robust drug pipeline even after taking Opdivo estimate cuts into account. However, it is important for investors to keep in mind that Bristol-Myers is now a value investment that requires a long-term time horizon, Cramer said. It could take a year or two for the story to play out. Short term, it could be choppy and the stock could go lower. Cramer recommended pouncing on weakness, especially as there could be some heading into the election. "In this negative environment for the drug industry, I think Bristol-Myers has finally come down to the point where it is simply too attractive to ignore as a long-term investment," Cramer said.

The research study covers the present scenario and growth prospects of the global musculoskeletal disorders therapeutics marketfor 2016-2020. To calculate the market size, the report considers revenue generated from the sales of branded, generic, and off-label drugs used to treat musculoskeletal disorders including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and fibromyalgia. The report also considers the revenues to be generated from the sales of drugs that are expected to be launched into the market along with the decline in revenues from the patent expiries of the marketed drugs during the forecast period. Request a sample report: http://www.technavio.com/request-a-sample?report=52671 Technavio's sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. Technavio healthcare and life sciences analysts highlight the following four factors that are contributing to the growth of the global musculoskeletal disorders therapeutics market: High growth potential of mAbs Unmet needs of therapeutics Tentative approval of advanced drugs Technological advancements in medical imaging Ask an analyst: http://www.technavio.com/content/ask-analyst?report=52671 Ask Technavio's lead analysts a question about this market and they will have your answer within 24 hours. High growth potential of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) The understanding of a disease at the molecular level increases the development and use of biologics in treating it. Biologics have a high affinity toward specific disease cells. They account for over 18% of the global pharmaceutical sales, outpacing the sales of branded pharmaceuticals. These drugs will continue to out-perform pharmaceuticals in terms of product sales, as there is an increasing need for effective treatment options. Biologics that treat musculoskeletal disorders are made from proteins. They work by blocking the action of key chemicals or cells involved in the inflammation of joints. A few mAbs used to treat musculoskeletal disorders include adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab, and infliximab. "Apart from the approved mAbs, there are other mAbs in various stages of the pipeline, for the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders," says Barath Palada, a lead analyst at Technavio for cardiovascular and metabolic disorders research. Unmet needs of therapeutics The growing unmet medical needs in the global musculoskeletal disorder market is a major factor driving the market. For instance, psoriatic arthritis has an elusive etiology, making it difficult for drug makers to develop and manufacture a targeted therapy for it. There is, as yet, no cure for the condition, and treatment depends on the symptoms of the disease. Similarly, tolerability and the method of drug administration are important factors influencing compliance with the treatment plan. Many effective pharmacologic options are available to prevent and treat osteoporosis. However, a few can slow down the rate of bone resorption or reverse the long-term loss of bone mass. These unmet medical needs, in terms of safety, efficacy, and compliance, have inspired researchers to develop drugs that increase bone density, replace lost bone, and rebuild bone strength. To gain a competitive advantage, market players should develop cost-competitive drugs with ease of administration that promote bone building effectively. For instance, Pfizer is expected to lead the market because of the launch of bazedoxifene (third-generation SERM) in late 2013. The company obtained the US FDA's approval for bazedoxifene as part of the combination drug Duavee in the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Moreover, biologic drugs have serious adverse effects. Therefore, many patients opt out of the treatment regimen. All these factors further extend the unmet medical needs of the market, presenting vendors with an opportunity to develop therapies that have better efficacy and safety profiles than currently available drugs. Tentative approval of advanced drugs Despite the availability of effective treatments, long-term patient compliance, and persistence with osteoporosis drugs is often suboptimal, resulting in reduced protection from fractures. There have been encouraging developments in the osteoporosis drug pipeline. Novel agents may offer superior benefit-risk profiles and improved safety profiles compared with conventional treatment options. Many drugs have obtained approval while others are in different phases of development. For instance, drugs such as odanacatib (MK-0822) by Merck exert their pharmacological action by inhibiting the enzyme cathepsin K, which is primarily responsible for the degradation of the bone matrix by osteoclasts. Unlike the antiresorptive drugs in the market, odanacatib targets the resorption process only and does not interfere with osteoclast stimulation during bone formation. Blosozumab (LY2541546) by Eli Lilly binds and neutralizes sclerostin. Blosozumab and odanacatib are some of the late-stage pipeline molecules expected to be launched during the forecast period. Similarly, the rheumatoid arthritis drugs market will witness the entry of novel molecules during the forecast period. The market entry of these advanced drug molecules is expected to increase their uptake due to improved efficacy, and would thus help in market growth. Technological advancements in medical imaging Early diagnosis of diseases is an important parameter to increase life expectancy. The availability of advanced medical imaging equipment has helped offer better medical outcomes. The technological advancements in medical imaging have improved the diagnosis of musculoskeletal disorders. The accurate diagnosis of a musculoskeletal disorder can influence 60% of physician's decision-making process to prescribe a treatment regimen for patients. Advances in the medical imaging field will indirectly increase the treatment-seeking population and can decrease the undiagnosed population, thereby increasing the penetration rate of drugs. The medical imaging methods used to diagnose musculoskeletal disorders include MRI, CT, and X-rays. Vendors are developing 2D, 3D, and 4D equipment in the area of medical imaging. These devices help minimize distortion in images and offer accurate real-time visualization of the anatomy. "Thus, with the availability of automated, versatile, and easy to use medical imaging equipment, physicians can diagnose the exact cause and nature of a disease accurately, thereby increasing the treatment- seeking population," says Barath.

That’s Just Silly. Buffett Bails on Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) Stock. Should You? Fight Deflation With United States Steel Corporation (X), AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS) View All Posts Bayer AG (ADR) (OTCMKTS:BAYRY) rose 3% in early Wednesday trade after its $66 billion, $128-per-share bid  for Monsanto Company (NYSE:MON) was accepted. Top executives appeared on TV to say they expect regulators to approve it, and Bayer stock was lifted in response. Monsanto stock barely reacted to the deal on Wednesday morning, still hovering near the pre-bid price of $107, a value of $46.2 billion. That is doubtless due to the regulatory juggernaut that Bayer’s deal still has to go through, with both European and American agencies showing increased skepticism toward big deals of any sort. The deal would consolidate a global farming chemical-and-seed business at a time of global glut in farm commodities. I drove through the Midwest several times in the last month, and the corn really was as high as an elephant’s eye, the soybeans super-abundant in the fields. This is thanks in large part to genetically-modified seed and fertilizers made by Monsanto. But if it goes through, expect good things from Bayer and BAYRY stock. The Terms of the Deal The terms of the deal, announced in a press release, include $19 billion in new Bayer stock, in the form of mandatory convertible shares with subscription rights, and $47 billion in cash, to be financed through a $57 billion bridge loan which has already been obtained. If the deal falls through, Monsanto gets a $2 billion break-up fee. 10 Growth Stocks That Will Outrun Google The price is 44% more than Monsanto was worth in May, and 19% above the $106 per share it was worth before the deal was announced. Assuming the deal does go through, the shareholders are going to do very well. The question becomes whether there can be big farming profits in a world of GMO, and whether BAYRY can capture them at the hefty price it is paying. The answer, of course, is yes. Making It Work What is working with grains can work with other agricultural commodities. Genetic engineering is really just an acceleration in the cross-breeding technology we have been using for centuries, techniques we’ve been using on cats and dogs for millennia. Ironically, Bayer becomes the largest player in GMOs at a time when the German government is among the most skeptical in the world about them. Before this deal, Bayer was basically a medical company. The soccer team it launched in 1904 still has a Bayer aspirin tablet on its club shield. Its drugs include Cipro, Levitra, Xarelto and the Yaz line of birth control products. It’s more heavily involved in consumer products, like Aleve, Claritin, One-a-Day, and in and animal health products like Advantix. Regulators may protest that Monsanto makes GMOs a two-way race between Bayer, a German company, and Syngenta AG (ADR) (NYSE:SYT), whose sale to ChemChina is now being finalized. Monsanto would give Bayer a market cap north of $130 billion — hefty, but still well short of pharmaceutical giants like Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Johnson & Johnson Inc. (NYSE:JNJ). That’s part of the hope here — that Monsanto’s roughly $15 billion in annual sales, and $3.5 billion in net income, can deliver to Bayer the financial kick it needs to play in those big leagues of drug discovery. This deal would more than double Bayer’s sales, and triple its net income. However, it may take up to two years to close, and would meanwhile occupy all of management’s time. More Deals On The Way Given the price, and what this does to the Bayer balance sheet, it seems inevitable that more deals are going to follow this one. The whole crop unit could become a new company, the consumer health units might be sold, or the pharmaceutical units could go on the market. Either way, it’s going to be interesting times for Bayer shareholders. My personal view is it’s going to be a profitable time, that the combined company, and its pieces, are going to be worth a lot more in two years than they are now.

Lord Mark Malloch-Brown, Chair of the Business Commission said: “The world cannot achieve sustainable development without the full engagement of the food and agriculture sectors, which are critical to achieving not just one, but the majority of the Global Goals. “Sunny’s leadership in agri-business will be essential to increasing the number of leaders who understand the incredible opportunity for both growth and sustainability in this sector.” The SDGs, launched in 2015, are 17 ambitious targets for ending hunger and poverty, reducing inequality and tackling climate change by 2030. The goals most clearly related to food and agriculture include Goal 2, which calls for an end to hunger, while Goal 12 calls for sustainable consumption and production, and Goal 13 which calls for mitigating the impacts of climate change. Other goals—ensuring decent work, health and well-being, gender equality and education—however, are also related to the food and agriculture sectors. Olam’s Co-Founder & Group CEO Sunny Verghese said: “One of the meanings of the word Olam is ‘enduring’ or ‘everlasting’. I believe the only way we can build an enduring business is to put sustainability at the heart of our business. This is reflected in ‘Growing Responsibly,’ our core purpose, which guides us to pursue profitable growth in an ethical, socially responsible and environmentally sustainable way. We have recently been recognised for this approach in Fortune “Change the World” list of 50 global companies. “As the world grapples with major developmental challenges including poverty, inequality, hunger, climate change impacts, depletion of natural capital and more, it is now critical for businesses, both large and small, to ensure that values and value creation are not traded off in the long run,” he said. “I am excited to join the Business Commission, as it seeks to inspire and catalyse companies to embed sustainability at the core of their businesses and aims to foster collaborations to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.” Sunny Verghese joins 31 other Commissioners, including CEOs Paul Polman, Unilever; Mads Nipper, Grundfos; Ken Frazier, Merck; John Fallon, Pearson; Ho Ching, Temasek; and Helen Hai, Made in Africa; as well as leaders from major business organisations including Lise Kingo, UN Global Compact; Peter Bakker, the World Business Council on Sustainable Development; Sharon Burrow, International Trade Union Confederation, and many others. Their expertise will be essential to shaping the Business Commission’s flagship report, to be published in January 2017, which will serve as the foundation for a number of activities to mobilise business leaders to align their companies with social and environmental impact.

The drugs discovery and developer noted in its stock market statement that it had indicated back in March, at the time of its full-year results, that it intended to focus more on the discovery side of things, and the implication is that this has been the reason behind the parting of the ways with Self. "Steve joined e-Therapeutics in December 2010 following a distinguished career at The Wellcome Foundation, Boots Healthcare and as R&D Director of Merck's Generic Global business. We thank him for his significant contribution to our activities and wish him continuing success in his new endeavours," said Iain Ross, executive chairman of e-Therapeutics. The company is clearly going through a transitional phase as the two most advanced of its discovery compounds approach the lead candidate selection process, ahead of entering pre-clinical development in the coming months. Professor Malcolm Young, who founded the company, stood down as chief executive in July, with chairman Ross assuming executive duties until a replacement can be found.

Several organisms are present in and on human bodies. Some organisms are normally harmless and even helpful. However, under certain circumstances, some organisms cause diseases. Infectious diseases spread from one person to another. Moreover, some are transmitted by bites from insects and animals. Infectious diseases also occur by consumption of contaminated food and water. For more information visit: https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/infectious-disease-treatment Signs and symptoms of infectious diseases depend on the type of organism and infection. Some of the most common symptoms of infectious diseases include fatigue and fever. Mild complaints of infectious diseases treated from rest and home remedies, while some life-threatening infections require hospitalization. Infectious diseases, such chickenpox and measles are prevented by vaccination. Frequent and thorough hand-washing also protect human body from infectious diseases. Moreover, anti-infective drugs play a vital role in the treatment of infectious diseases. Anti-infective drugs are used to kill and stop growth of microorganism. These drugs can act as a defense system for human body and neutralize the action of disease causative agents. Based on microorganism, anti-infective drugs are mainly categorized into antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal and antiparasitic drugs. The global infectious disease treatment market (https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/infectio...) is segmented into antibacterial drugs, antifungal drugs, antiviral drugs and antiparasitic drugs. Antibacterial drugs segment covers tetracyclines, beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, macrolides, phenicols, sulfonamides and quinolones. Antifungal segment includes azoles, echinodians, pyrimidines, polyenes and allylamines. Antiviral drugs segment covers HIV, hepatitis B and C treatment drugs. North America dominates the global infectious disease treatment market followed by Europe. The U.S., followed by Canada, is the largest market for infectious disease treatment in the North American region. Key driving factor for infectious disease treatment market in the region is increasing research activities on various types of diseases. Germany, France and the U.K. are some of the largest markets for infectious diseases in Europe. However, Asia-Pacific represents the fastest growing region in the global infectious disease treatment market. This is due to minimal wages and availability of skilled professionals in the region. These factors attract drug manufacturing companies to invest in the Asian countries. In addition, in developing countries, such as China and India, government has launched several programs and initiatives to increase awareness about infectious diseases. China, Japan and India are largest infectious disease treatment markets in the region. Request for Table of Content: https://www.psmarketresearch.com/enquiry-form.php?enqid=1...
