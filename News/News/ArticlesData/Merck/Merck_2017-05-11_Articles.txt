Shares of Merck are gaining after one of its drugs received accelerated approval from the FDA. By Ben Levisohn May 11, 2017 11:20 a.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Shares of Merck (MRK) are gaining today after the FDA expanded the use of Keytruda to patients with advanced lung cancer when combined with chemotherapy, even when a high level of a key protein is missing. Illustration: Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Leerink's Seamus Fernandez and team have the details: Merck announced that the FDA granted accelerated approval for Keytruda (pembrolizumab; anti-PD-1) in combination with carboplatin and Eli Lilly's (LLY) (OP) Alimta (pemetrexed) for first-line (1L) non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) regardless of PD-L1 status. This approval was based on the results from the randomized cohort G of the Phase 1/2 Keynote-021 trial and the data contained in the label are largely the same as those presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) annual meeting in October 2016. Results from the confirmatory Ph3 Keynote-189 trial are expected in late 2017; however we believe this accelerated approval may be a tacit admission that the agency took an early peek at this study and the interim data were compelling. We expect to see rapid uptake of this combination in eligible patients and await initial data from PD-1/L1 + CTLA-4 combinations from AstraZeneca's (AZN) (OP) MYSTIC trial (PFS data expected mid-year) and Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) (OP) CheckMate-227 trial (data expected in 1H:18, with a potential early look at PD-L1+ patients later this year), as well as data from various trials of RHHBY’s (NR) Tecentriq (atezolizumab; anti-PD-L1) plus chemotherapy (including one trial with Avastin [bevacizumab; anti-VEGF]). BMO's Alex Arfaei expects "a strong uptake" of Keytruda: While most 1L NSCLC patients can get Keytruda + chemo, those with 50%+ PD-L1 (20-25% of the market) will likely get Keytruda monotherapy, unless KN-189 indicates otherwise. We expect strong uptake of the combo in PD-L1 negative and unknown patients (~40% of the market), and believe this will be more durable than Street probably expects given that Opdivo +Yervoy has not shown promising data for this segment. Shares of Merck have gained 1.6% to $64.94 at 11:15 a.m. today, while Eli Lilly has declined 0.2% to $80.35, Astra Zeneca has fallen 0.4% to $30.93, and Bristol-Myers Squibb is off 0.1% at $55.06.

Merck got a leg up on the competition with FDA approval for its Keytruda drug to treat lung cancer. (Merck) ALLISON GATLIN 5/11/2017 Reprints Dow component Merck (MRK) now has a one- to two-year lead on its rivals in treating advanced lung cancer, an analyst said Thursday after the FDA approved the drug giant's Keytruda-chemo combo. Late Wednesday, the FDA had granted accelerated approval to Keytruda plus Eli Lilly's (LLY) chemotherapy Alimta and carboplatin, another chemo drug. The combination is approved for all patients regardless of whether their tumors have a lot of what is known as a PD-L1 protein, which exists on cancer cells. Keytruda works by blocking the interaction between a PD-L1 protein on the surface of a cancer cell and the PD-1 protein on an immune system cell. Doing so helps the immune system identify the camouflaged cancer. UBS analyst Marc Goodman sees Merck as having a one- to two-year lead in lung cancer over the likes of Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Roche (RHHBY). But other combo therapies from the likes of Bristol-Myers and AstraZeneca are on the horizon for 2017 and 2018. He has a buy rating and 70 price target on Merck stock. Merck's accelerated approval for Keytruda plus chemotherapy is contingent on a study confirming the strength of the treatment. Results from the confirmatory study, dubbed Keynote-189, are expected in September. "However, we believe this accelerated approval may be a tacit admission that the agency took an early peek at this study and the interim data were compelling," Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a note. He has a market perform rating on Merck stock. On the stock market today, shares of Merck, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, rose 0.8% to 64.43, after earlier rising as much as 2%. Shares of Bristol were unchanged while AstraZeneca and Roche edged up 0.3%. IBD'S TAKE: The immuno-oncology market is far from mature. Keep tabs on IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News page for the latest on the emerging sector. Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan expects the approval to expand Keytruda's market to 100,000 patients in the U.S. from 35,000. Keytruda is also approved as a first treatment and following chemo to treat lung cancer patients whose tumors have a lot of the PD-L1 protein. Studies have shown that patients whose tumors have a lot of the PD-L1 protein respond better to the type of therapy offered by Keytruda as well as Bristol's Opdivo. But in a study presented in October, Keytruda plus chemo improved overall survival rate by 55% in all patients regardless PD-L1 status. Adam Schechter, executive vice president and president of Merck's Global Human Health unit, expects physicians to think about the Keytruda-chemo combination differently in younger patients vs. older patients. "In addition to that, we believe that since we've studied the drug with Alimta, that early adoption will probably used where physicians would use Alimta," he said on Merck's first-quarter earnings conference call on May 2. But "it's not a pent-up demand," he said. "I would look at it as a build as new patients come into the market and I think that it really is (an) exciting opportunity for lung cancer patients, but also to establish Keytruda further as a real preferred treatment therapy." Keytruda's approval with chemo regardless of PD-L1 status doesn't bode well for Bristol which is struggling amid increased competition. In lung cancer, Bristol's Opdivo is approved as a second-line treatment, meaning it's only prescribed after patients have undergone a round of chemo. Bristol is looking at Opdivo plus Yervoy in advanced lung cancer. Yervoy targets the CTLA-4 interaction between an immune cell and a cancer cell. AstraZeneca's Mystic study is looking at its Imfinzi, a PD-L1 antibody, with tremelimumab, a CTLA-4 antibody, in lung cancer. "Data readouts could change investor sentiment this year," UBS' Goodman wrote in a note. He assumes $2 billion and $3 billion in first-line lung cancer sales in the U.S. for Keytruda in 2018 and 2019, respectively. First-line means Keytruda can be prescribed before chemo.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 11 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman FDA Approves Merck’s KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) as First-Line Combination Therapy with Pemetrexed and Carboplatin for Patients with Metastatic Nonsquamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), Irrespective of PD-L1 Expression KENILWORTH, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), the company’s anti-PD-1 therapy, in combination with pemetrexed (brand name Alimta®) and carboplatin (pem/carbo), a commonly used chemotherapy regimen, for the first-line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, irrespective of PD-L1 expression. Under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, this indication is approved based on tumor response rate and progression-free survival (PFS). Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. The approval was based on data from KEYNOTE-021, Cohort G1, in 123 previously untreated patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations and irrespective of PD-L1 expression. In this trial, KEYTRUDA + pem/carbo demonstrated an objective response rate (ORR) that was nearly double the ORR of pem/carbo alone (55 percent [95% CI: 42, 68] compared to 29 percent [95% CI: 18, 41], respectively; all responses were partial responses). Among patients who received KEYTRUDA + pem/carbo, 93 percent had a duration of response of six months or more (range 1.4+ to 13.0+ months) compared to 81 percent who received pem/carbo alone (range 1.4+ to 15.2+ months). In addition, findings demonstrated an improvement in PFS (HR 0.53 [95% CI, 0.31-0.91; p=0.0205]), with a median PFS of 13.0 months (95% CI, 8.3-not estimable) for patients treated with KEYTRUDA + pem/carbo compared to 8.9 months (95% CI, 4.4-10.3) with pem/carbo alone. Immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred with KEYTRUDA including pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, and nephritis. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, KEYTRUDA should be withheld or discontinued and corticosteroids administered when appropriate. KEYTRUDA can also cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions; for Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab). Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Female patients of reproductive potential should be advised of the potential hazard to a fetus. For more information regarding immune-mediated and infusion-related adverse reactions and use in pregnancy, see “Selected Important Safety Information” below. “The improved responses seen with the KEYTRUDA plus pemetrexed/carboplatin regimen are significant, and highlight the importance of finding new approaches that address the unmet needs of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer,” said Dr. Roger M. Perlmutter, president, Merck Research Laboratories. “Today’s approval further supports our commitment to improve the lives of people with cancer.” “This approval marks an important milestone in the treatment of lung cancer. Now, pembrolizumab in combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin can be prescribed in the first-line setting for patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer, irrespective of PD-L1 expression,” said Dr. Corey Langer, director of thoracic oncology and professor of medicine at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. “Physicians should continue to use each patient’s individual characteristics – including biomarker status, histology, and other clinical factors – to determine the best treatment plan for each person.” The combination therapy indication makes KEYTRUDA an option for more patients. KEYTRUDA is the only anti-PD-1 approved in the first-line setting as both monotherapy and combination therapy for appropriate patients with metastatic NSCLC. KEYTRUDA is approved as monotherapy in the first-line setting for patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression (tumor proportion score [TPS] ≥50%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is also indicated for the second-line or greater treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA. “The combination of this immunotherapy with pemetrexed and carboplatin is more good news for patients,” said Bonnie J. Addario, a lung cancer survivor and founder of the Bonnie J. Addario Lung Cancer Foundation. “Congratulations to Merck and the FDA for moving so swiftly on this important addition to our patients’ options for treatment. With this approval, hope for lung cancer patients continues to improve.” Data Supporting the Approval The efficacy of KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) was investigated in patients enrolled in the open-label, multicenter, multi-cohort KEYNOTE-021 study; the efficacy data are limited to patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC randomized within the single cohort (Cohort G1). The KEYNOTE-021G1 trial was conducted in collaboration with Eli Lilly and Company, the maker of pemetrexed. The key eligibility criteria for this cohort were locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression status, and no prior systemic treatment for metastatic disease. Patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within two years of treatment; a medical condition that required immunosuppression; or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior 26 weeks were ineligible. Patients in KEYNOTE-021G1 were randomized to receive KEYTRUDA + pem/carbo (n=60) or pem/carbo alone (n=63). Patients in the KEYTRUDA combination arm received KEYTRUDA (200 mg), pemetrexed (500 mg/m2), and carboplatin (AUC 5 mg/mL/min) every three weeks for four cycles followed by KEYTRUDA every three weeks. In the control arm, patients received pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) and carboplatin (AUC 5 mg/mL/min) alone for four cycles. At the investigator’s discretion, maintenance pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) every three weeks was permitted in both treatment arms. Treatment with KEYTRUDA continued until Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1-defined progression of disease as determined by blinded independent central review (BICR), unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 24 months. Administration of KEYTRUDA was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and deriving clinical benefit as determined by the investigator. The major efficacy outcome measure was ORR as assessed by BICR using RECIST 1.1. Additional efficacy outcome measures were PFS as assessed by BICR using RECIST 1.1, duration of response, and overall survival (OS). Findings from this cohort demonstrated an ORR with KEYTRUDA + pem/carbo of 55 percent (95% CI: 42, 68) compared to 29 percent (95% CI: 18, 41) for pem/carbo alone. KEYTRUDA in this combination also reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 47 percent (HR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.31, 0.91]; p=0.0205). Exploratory analyses found similar results in patients with or without PD-L1 expression, with an ORR in patients whose tumors did not express PD-L1 (TPS <1%) of 57 percent with KEYTRUDA + pem/carbo compared to 13.0 percent with pem/carbo alone; in patients with PD-L1 TPS ≥1%, the ORR was 54 percent with KEYTRUDA + pem/carbo compared to 38 percent with pem/carbo alone.

In metastatic NSCLC, KEYTRUDA is approved at a fixed dose of 200 mg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression; pemetrexed and carboplatin should be administered according to their FDA-approved labels. About KEYTRUDA ®(pembrolizumab) Injection KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. Studies of KEYTRUDA – from the largest immuno-oncology program in the industry with more than 450 trials – include a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand factors that predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including the exploration of several different biomarkers across a broad range of tumors. KEYTRUDA ®(pembrolizumab) Indications and Dosing Melanoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma at a dose of 2 mg/kg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Lung Cancer KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥50%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is also indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and progression-free survival. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In metastatic NSCLC, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. When administering KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy, KEYTRUDA should be administered prior to chemotherapy when given on the same day. See also the Prescribing Information for pemetrexed and carboplatin.

Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA ®  (pembrolizumab) KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 94 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%) pneumonitis, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (6.9%) compared to those without (2.9%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 48 (1.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) colitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 19 (0.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%) hepatitis. Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis. Hypophysitis occurred in 17 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%) hypophysitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency). Administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) for Grade 2; withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. KEYTRUDA can cause thyroid disorders, including hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and thyroiditis. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 96 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%) hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism occurred in 237 (8.5%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%) hypothyroidism. Thyroiditis occurred in 16 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%) thyroiditis. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. Administer replacement hormones for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. KEYTRUDA can cause type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 9 (0.3%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis. KEYTRUDA can cause other clinically important immune-mediated adverse reactions. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction. The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), exfoliative dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid, rash (1.4%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, and partial seizures arising in a patient with inflammatory foci in brain parenchyma. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and postmarketing use. Solid organ transplant rejection has been reported in postmarketing use of KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab). Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider benefit of treatment with KEYTRUDA vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients. KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions, including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after being treated with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA on any trial, 6 patients (26%) developed graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), one of which was fatal, and 2 patients (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning, one of which was fatal. Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody before transplantation. These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute GVHD, severe (Grade 3 to 4) acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic VOD, and other immune-mediated adverse reactions, and intervene promptly. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA monotherapy was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 8% of 682 patients with metastatic NSCLC. The most common adverse event resulting in permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA was pneumonitis (1.8%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 23% of patients; the most common (≥1%) were diarrhea (1%), fatigue (1.3%), pneumonia (1%), liver enzyme elevation (1.2%), decreased appetite (1.3%), and pneumonitis (1%). The most common adverse reactions (occurring in at least 20% of patients and at a higher incidence than with docetaxel) were decreased appetite (25% vs 23%), dyspnea (23% vs 20%), and nausea (20% vs 18%). When KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) was administered in combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin, KEYTRUDA was discontinued in 10% of 59 patients. The most common adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of KEYTRUDA (≥2%) was acute kidney injury (3.4%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 39% of patients; the most common (≥2%) were fatigue (8%), neutrophil count decreased (8%), anemia (5%), dyspnea (3.4%), and pneumonitis (3.4%).The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) with KEYTRUDA compared to carbo/pem alone were fatigue (71% vs 50%), nausea (68% vs 56%), constipation (51% vs 37%), rash (42% vs 21%), vomiting (39% vs 27%), dyspnea (39% vs 21%), diarrhea (37% vs 23%), decreased appetite (31% vs. 23%), headache (31% vs 16%), cough (24% vs 18%), dizziness (24%vs 16%), insomnia (24% vs 15%), pruritus (24% vs 4.8%), peripheral edema (22% vs 18%), dysgeusia (20% vs 11%), alopecia (20% vs 3.2%), upper respiratory tract infection (20% vs 3.2%), and arthralgia (15% vs 24%). The study was not designed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in adverse reaction rates for KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy, as compared to chemotherapy alone, for any specified adverse reaction. It is not known whether KEYTRUDA is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, instruct women to discontinue nursing during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the final dose.

On Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the U.S. drug giant's superstar cancer immunotherapy Keytruda, in combination with chemotherapy, as a go-to treatment option for Americans with advanced lung cancer who haven't received any previous medicines. This approval's importance is hard to overstate. For one, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in America (behind breast cancer) and by far the deadliest one, killing nearly 156,000 U.S. residents every year. The specific type of lung cancer that Keytruda plus chemo is now approved to treat—non-squamous non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)—makes up about three in four of the more than 222,000 new annual lung cancer cases in America. Click here to subscribe to Brainstorm Health Daily, our brand new newsletter about health innovations. That adds up to a truly gigantic market opportunity and potential billions upon billions in sales (oh, and also years added to patients' lives). "This is the key game changer for Keytruda," as Leerink Partners analyst Seamus Fernandez put it, according to Reuters. The treatment was actually already approved as a "first-in-line" therapy (i.e., it could be the first drug a doctor prescribed to a patient) for advanced lung cancer—but with one big caveat: patients had to have high levels of a certain protein targeted by Keytruda called PD-L1. This latest FDA green light nixes that constraining requirement. Keytruda's newest approval also sets it apart from rivals like Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo, another so-called "checkpoint inhibitor" immunotherapy drug. That treatment failed to meet its goals in recent lung cancer trials, paving the way for Keytruda to potentially dominate the field and sending Bristol-Myers shares tumbling. It's a marked reversal of fortune. Opdivo once seemed like it was fated to become the next-gen cancer drug king, easily lapping Keytruda in sales. And, to be fair, it could still fare very well: both Keytruda and Opdivo are being tested in dozens of cancer types and have racked up approvals in several of them. (Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Roche also have their own checkpoint inhibitor drugs.) But the lung cancer market is key—and there, at least, Keytruda has thrown down the gauntlet.

Under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, this indication is approved based on tumor response rate and progression-free survival (PFS). Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. The approval was based on data from KEYNOTE-021, Cohort G1, in 123 previously untreated patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations and irrespective of PD-L1 expression. In this trial, KEYTRUDA + pem/carbo demonstrated an objective response rate (ORR) that was nearly double the ORR of pem/carbo alone (55 percent [95% CI: 42, 68] compared to 29 percent [95% CI: 18, 41], respectively; all responses were partial responses). Among patients who received KEYTRUDA + pem/carbo, 93 percent had a duration of response of six months or more (range 1.4+ to 13.0+ months) compared to 81 percent who received pem/carbo alone (range 1.4+ to 15.2+ months). In addition, findings demonstrated an improvement in PFS (HR 0.53 [95% CI, 0.31-0.91; p=0.0205]), with a median PFS of 13.0 months (95% CI, 8.3-not estimable) for patients treated with KEYTRUDA + pem/carbo compared to 8.9 months (95% CI, 4.4-10.3) with pem/carbo alone. Immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred with KEYTRUDA including pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, and nephritis. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, KEYTRUDA should be withheld or discontinued and corticosteroids administered when appropriate. KEYTRUDA can also cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions; for Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab). Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Female patients of reproductive potential should be advised of the potential hazard to a fetus. For more information regarding immune-mediated and infusion-related adverse reactions and use in pregnancy, see “Selected Important Safety Information” below. “The improved responses seen with the KEYTRUDA plus pemetrexed/carboplatin regimen are significant, and highlight the importance of finding new approaches that address the unmet needs of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer,” said Dr. Roger M. Perlmutter, president, Merck Research Laboratories. “Today’s approval further supports our commitment to improve the lives of people with cancer.” “This approval marks an important milestone in the treatment of lung cancer. Now, pembrolizumab in combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin can be prescribed in the first-line setting for patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer, irrespective of PD-L1 expression,” said Dr. Corey Langer, director of thoracic oncology and professor of medicine at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. “Physicians should continue to use each patient’s individual characteristics – including biomarker status, histology, and other clinical factors – to determine the best treatment plan for each person.” The combination therapy indication makes KEYTRUDA an option for more patients. KEYTRUDA is the only anti-PD-1 approved in the first-line setting as both monotherapy and combination therapy for appropriate patients with metastatic NSCLC. KEYTRUDA is approved as monotherapy in the first-line setting for patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression (tumor proportion score [TPS] ≥50%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is also indicated for the second-line or greater treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA. “The combination of this immunotherapy with pemetrexed and carboplatin is more good news for patients,” said Bonnie J.

Smith Helaine Kang Home Energy Mining Tech Pharma & Biotech Home News Newswires NYSE:MRK Merck gets Keytruda go-ahead as a first line lung cancer treatment Share Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version 08:35 11 May 2017 Lung cancer in the US alone is a market worth at least US$12bn a year. Keytruda can be used in combination with chemotherapy for newly disgnosed patients Merck & Co (NYSE:MRK) has been given approval for flagship immunotherapy treatment Keytruda to be a first line treatment for lung cancer, further consolidating its lead over rivals Bristol Myers- Squibb and Astra Zeneca. Shares in the pharma giant raced up 4% after hours on the news and are set to open higher again as analysts said the recommendation opens up potential revenues of billions of dollars for the drug. Lung cancer in the US alone is a market worth at least US$12bn a year. Merck’s success has been in marked contrast to its rivals and especially Bristol Myers, which saw its value slump by a fifth last year when its immunotherapy star Opdivo failed to hit its endpoint in a non-small cell lung cancer trial. Astra Zeneca’s hopes, meanwhile, are pinned on its ongoing Mystic trial, which is a combination therapy using tremelimumab, an experimental combination therapy based around CTLA-4 therapy. Merck rushed through its application for Keytruda as a first line lung cancer treatment following an enhanced phase II trial that halved the rate of disease progression and reduced the number of deaths by 40%. In combination with established chemotherapy drugs, meanwhile, it was twice as effective as chemotherapy alone.

The book will be available online through Insiderbooks, and at SAPPHIRE NOW.

Inc. MRK, +0.77% shares surged 2.4% in premarket trade Thursday after the company's Keytruda was approved in combination with chemotherapy for first-line lung cancer. The approval is key because the approval applies regardless of patient expression of the PD-L1 biomarker, which "opens up the 1st line market meaningfully for Merck," said EvercoreISI analyst Umer Raffat. Raffat described the approval as "a very significant opportunity," and said he expected demand for Keytruda in this wider patient population to grow as new patients are diagnosed. Keytruda and chemotherapy is "a clear positive as it positions the company in a leadership position in this $10bn+ segment of the market," said J.P. Morgan analyst Chris Schott, who rates the company overweight with a $63.94 price target. The company also has "a distinct time-to-market advantage (9-12 months) over peers in 1L lung, raising the bar for competitors to show differentiation relative to Keytruda/Alimta to gain share in this setting." The development was an incremental negative for rival Bristol-Myers Squibb BMY, +0.00% which has been neck-in-neck with Merck in this area of drug development, Schott said. Bristol-Myers Squibb shares declined a scant 0.5% in premarket trade.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search Skip to Navigation Skip to Main Content Skip to Related Content 0 News Home Follow Us US World Politics Tech Science Odd News ABC News Yahoo Originals Katie Couric Matt Bai Pfizer immuno-oncology drug wins U.S. approval for bladder cancer Reuters May 9, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share FILE PHOTO: The Pfizer logo is seen at their world headquarters in New York April 28, 2014. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File PhotoMore (Reuters) - U.S. health regulators on Tuesday granted accelerated approval for Pfizer Inc's immuno-oncology drug Bavencio to treat advanced bladder cancer, marking the second approval in less than two months for the treatment developed along with Germany's Merck KGaA. Bavencio, known chemically as avelumab, was approved for patients with locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer whose disease progressed during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or within 12 months of chemotherapy treatment before or after surgery. It is the fourth new immunotherapy to be approved for advanced bladder cancer. In March, Bavencio was approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat a rare skin cancer called Merkel cell carcinoma. German Merck said the wholesale price for Bavencio based on an average bladder cancer patient will be about $13,000 a month, less than the $15,000 per month AstraZeneca set after its Imfinzi received U.S. approval for bladder cancer a week ago. Roche's Tecentriq and Opdivo from Bristol-Myers Squibb are also approved for bladder cancer. The Bavencio approval was based on response rates from a study of 242 patients who all received Bavencio.

Infections are growing fastest among Americans in their 20s, because of injection drug use, according to research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The abuse of heroin and prescription opioids has boomed in the U.S. in recent years, creating a new generation of addicts at risk from needle-sharing. There were 34,000 new infections in 2015, the agency estimated. “We have seen the states that have the largest increases among young people with drugs they inject are also having these astronomical increases in rates of hepatitis C,” said John Ward, director of the CDC’s division of viral hepatitis. "We feel like the 34,000 estimate is a fairly conservative one and the problem is getting larger." While grim news from a public health standpoint, the rising number of infections is an opportunity for drugmakers including Gilead Sciences Inc., AbbVie Inc. and Merck & Co. that have introduced effective cures. Their business has slowed as previously diagnosed patients have been treated -- Gilead said in February it was running out of patients. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Much of the initial population for treatment came from baby boomers who contracted the disease decades ago from tainted blood products. While patients may have known they were infected for years, they had to wait for the new therapies to come along. Those patients-in-waiting helped Gilead sell $12.49 billion of its hepatitis C pills in the U.S. in 2015, the biggest new drug introduction in history. Most Vulnerable Older, long-infected patients remain the most vulnerable, with more of them living with and dying from the infections. The number of new cases among young people pales in comparison, said Brian Skorney, an analyst with Robert W. Baird & Co. Between 2 million to 4 million people in the U.S. have hepatitis C, Skorney said. The issue is getting them diagnosed, getting them interested in treatment, and getting insurance to pay, he said. “It probably doesn’t move the needle at all -- there’s so many patients with hepatitis C” already, Skorney said by phone. “The patients who are getting diagnosed are certainly not taking good care of themselves, and therefore are harder candidates to get in and get treatment.” Infections Across America Among the new cases, young white Americans living in the suburbs or rural areas were most likely to get infected, with cases widespread in Appalachia, the Midwest and New England, the CDC said. The highest rates were in West Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee, despite a lack of increased funding for detecting new infections by the CDC during the years the survey was conducted. The rise in the number of new cases also points to the success of surveillance efforts put in place in anticipation of novel pills, the first of which was Gilead’s Sovaldi in 2013. There’s the potential to eradicate the virus from the U.S. using a combination of infection prevention, increasing access to the new pills and making sure the drugs are taken correctly, according to the CDC’s Ward. It often takes years to start affecting the body, eventually damaging the liver. “We have a cure for this disease and the tools to prevent new infections,” he said in a statement accompanying the research. “Now we need a substantial, focused and concerted national effort” to make the tools and treatments available to all Americans, he said. Even with the new surveillance efforts, hepatitis C detection can be difficult, particularly among younger patients who may be using drugs and are less likely get regular medical care. The CDC received reports of 2,436 new cases in 2015, the most recent numbers available, up from 850 cases in 2010. There are 3.5 million people living with hepatitis C infections nationwide, with the number of deaths tied to the virus rising to 19,629 in 2015. About half of those who died were aged 55 to 63, the CDC said. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 11 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Ra Pharmaceuticals Reports First Quarter 2017 Financial Results and Provides Corporate Update CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Ra Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: RARX), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focusing on the development of next-generation therapeutics for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017 and provided an update on recent corporate and clinical developments. “We continue to advance our lead compound, RA101495, and we recently commenced dosing in our Phase 2 program in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, or PNH,” said Doug Treco, PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ra Pharma. “The goal of our program in PNH is to provide sustained and improved disease control, which reduces the risk of breakthrough hemolysis, while simultaneously offering patients a more convenient and flexible subcutaneous treatment regimen as a substitute for intravenous administration, today’s standard of care. We look forward to sharing initial data from these Phase 2 studies mid-year 2017 and additional results at year-end.” Dr. Treco added: “We are also investigating RA101495 in other complement-mediated diseases such as myasthenia gravis (MG) and lupus nephritis (LN). We plan to initiate a Phase 2 trial in MG and a Phase 1b clinical trial supporting development in LN in the second half of 2017. We look forward to updating you on our RA101495 development plans, our orally-available small molecule C5 inhibitors and other pipeline programs.” First Quarter 2017 Financial Results As of March 31, 2017, Ra Pharma reported total cash and equivalents of $105.4 million. For the first quarter of 2017, the Company reported a net loss of $11.4 million, or a net loss of $0.50 per share (basic and diluted), compared to net loss of $5.1 million, or a net loss of $9.42 per share for the same period in 2016. Research and development expenses for the first quarter of 2017 were $9.0 million compared to $5.0 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in R&D expenses for the first quarter 2016 were primarily due to clinical development costs associated with our lead program, RA101495, for the treatment of PNH. General and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2017 were $2.5 million, compared to $1.3 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in G&A expenses for the first quarter 2017 were due primarily to employee-related costs, including salary, benefits and stock-based compensation due to the increase in G&A headcount to support the growth of the Company. The Company’s revenue is derived from its collaboration and licensing agreement with Merck. Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $0 compared to $1.9 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease was due to the expiration of the research term of the Merck Agreement in April 2016. About RA101495 Ra Pharma is developing RA101495 for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (rMG), and lupus nephritis (LN). The product is designed for convenient, once daily SC self-administration. RA101495 is a synthetic, macrocyclic peptide discovered using Ra Pharma’s powerful proprietary drug discovery technology. The peptide binds complement component 5 (C5) with sub-nanomolar affinity and allosterically inhibits its cleavage into C5a and C5b upon activation of the classical, alternative or lectin pathways. By binding to a region of C5 corresponding to C5b, RA101495 also disrupts the interaction between C5b and C6 and prevents assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC). This activity defines an additional, novel mechanism for the inhibition of C5 function. In Phase 1 studies, dosing of RA101495 was well tolerated in healthy volunteers and demonstrated sustained and near complete suppression of hemolysis and complement activity. To learn more about RA101495, please visit: http://rapharma.com/pipeline/ra101495/. About the Extreme Diversity™ Platform Ra Pharma’s proprietary Extreme Diversity™ mRNA display platform allows the Company to produce synthetic macrocyclic peptides that combine the diversity and specificity of antibodies with the pharmacological properties of small molecules.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 11 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Global Pulmonary Drugs Industry Trends and Global Foresight to 2024 The intensity of competition in the global pulmonary drugs market is exceptionally high with the presence of few dominant players. However, Transparency Market Research observes that the leading players are expected to lose their share in the overall market as patents for several drugs are poised to expire in the coming years. The top five players in the market are GlaxoSmithKline Plc., Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Astra Zeneca, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., and Merck & Co., Inc. “The companies will focus on building their pipelines and developing effective and result-oriented medicines to meet the unmet demands of the patients across the globe,” states the lead author of the research report. Asia Pacific to Lead Global Market due to Phenomenal Unmet Medical Needs According to the research report, the global pulmonary drugs market is expected to be worth US$ 28,082.1 mn by the end of 2024 as compared to US$ 48,039.7 mn in 2015. Analysts calculate that the global market will plummet at a CAGR of -6.3% during the forecast period of 2016 and 2024. The market will thrive as the demand for combination drugs is anticipated to remain on the rise during the forecast period. The report estimates that the combination drugs segment will reach a valuation of US$5,217.5 mn by the end of 2024. On the other hand, in terms of geography, Asia Pacific will emerge as the leading region in the global market due to a huge pool of unmet medical demands. By the end of 2024, the Asia Pacific pulmonary drugs market is estimated to account for a share of 23.1% in the global market. High Prevalence of Respiratory Disorders due to Smoking Improves Uptake of Pulmonary Drugs Despite the projected decline, the demand for pulmonary drugs will continue to build as the population is reeling under the high prevalence of chronic respiratory disorders. The Forum of International Respiratory Societies (FIRS) states that the about 200 million meet their fatal end due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and about 235 million due to asthma. These statistics have been the primary growth drivers for the overall pulmonary drugs market in the past few years. The rising number of smokers across the globe have also triggered the demand for pulmonary drugs as they are usually at the receiving end of respiratory disorders. The World Health Organization states that consumption of tobacco leads to six million deaths every year while 600, 000 are exposed to second-hand smoke, which is known to cause asthma. Thus the changes in lifestyle are anticipated to play a crucial role in the development of global market. View the report @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/pulmonary-drugs-market… The global pulmonary drugs market is also benefitting from the increasing disposable incomes and the rising awareness about treating pulmonary ailments. The increasing investments made in research and development of pulmonary drug delivery systems have also favored market growth in recent times. The growing pool of unmet demands due to population explosion in several developing countries and the entry of innovative and effective drugs in the market is also anticipated to boost the uptake of these drugs in the coming few years. Availability of Counterfeit Drugs Hampers Market Growth Analysts anticipate that the negative growth of the global pulmonary drugs market will be attributable to the patent cliffs in the coming years that will hamper the revenues of several leading players. This issue will be further addled by the entry of generic drugs in the global market. The strict regulatory process of getting these drugs approved from various authorities is also expected to dampen the spirit of the market during the forecast period. Furthermore, the wide availability of counterfeit drugs is also acting a significant impediment to the overall market.

Ogg May 11, 2017 11:00 am EDT Print Email Tweet It is no secret that pharma and biotech shares have had to deal with at least some headwinds over the past year. It turns out that drug pricing concerns and political oversight can still be overlooked. In the case of Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK), its Keytruda is getting accelerated in the first line nonsquamous, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) setting in combination with Eli Lilly and Co.’s (NYSE: LLY) Alimta, as well as carboplatin. At least one firm sees this as a positive, and Merck shares are again within striking distance of a 52-week high. Credit Suisse’s Vamil Divan now expects Merck to trade up to the $66 to $67 range, as this now opens up a massive commercial opportunity where Merck can dominate for the rest of 2017. Credit Suisse’s report said: We are pleased (and relieved!) that Merck has received accelerated approval for the use of its key oncology product Keytruda in the first line nonsquamous, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) setting in combination with Lilly’s Alimta as well as carboplatin… While investors have been repeatedly asking us “what’s taking so long”, taking a step back allows one to appreciate that today’s approval shows how rapidly the FDA is really working to bring immuno-oncology (I-O) to patients… We reiterate our Outperform rating on Merck and continue to view it as our Top Pick in US Pharma. Credit Suisse said that they would also expect Eli Lilly shares to trade up modestly on the news, and the firm is reiterating its Outperform rating on Eli Lilly as well. Credit Suisse also maintained its Neutral rating on Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (NYSE: BMY) in that call. The view is that Bristol-Myers likely will see its shares trade lower on the news. The report noted that the opportunity for Opdivo in a second line NSCLC continues to shrink. Credit Suisse’s positive bias for Merck here is that this approval nearly triples the number of U.S. patients that Keytruda is now approved for in the first line NSCLC setting. It was previously approved for approximately 35,000 patients annually, but now the population may be as much as 100,000 patients. The firm sees this action as setting the stage for Keytruda to show rapid sequential growth over the next several quarters. According to Credit Suisse estimates, global Keytruda sales are now expected to increase to $777 million this quarter, $958 million in the third quarter and $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter — for a total of $3.53 billion for all of 2017.

But the truth is, Big Pharma has little to do with it. Buy-and-raise schemes are also universally reviled because they sound so bad, especially among politicians looking to stay relevant and loud. Buy-and-raise, as distasteful as it is, does not really have much to do with it either. Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), GlaxoSmithKline PLC (NASDAQ: GSK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE: BMY) account for a combined $564 billion in market cap, but their stocks have vastly underperformed the Nasdaq since 2000. While the Nasdaq is up 50% since the turn of the millennium, counting from the Nasdaq bubble, Merck and Pfizer are virtually unchanged for 17 years now. Bristol-Myers is down nearly 20%, and GlaxoSmithKline is down 25%. All the disparaging of Big Pharma aside, they aren’t really the culprits here. Even if they were, they clearly haven’t done a very good job of taking advantage. So who is? The answer is specialty pharmaceuticals, with spending increases mostly coming from new treatments primarily for cancer, hepatitis C (HCV) and autoimmune diseases. Look at specialty pharma stocks like Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ: GILD) and it’s clear where the big spending increases are going. How much of the spending is concentrated in specialty areas? In 2015, 35% of all prescription drug spending in the United States was concentrated in cancer, HCV and autoimmune disorders. Humira, for example, is an autoimmune drug, and it is the best-selling drug of all time. The point is, the astronomical increase in drug spending is not a general trend of biotech as a whole charging more money for the same stuff. It’s a result of new pricier drugs that didn’t exist before. From a shareholder perspective, the real money is in oncology, antivirals and anti-inflammatories. Succeed in one of these three categories and some of that record spending will head your way. That said, which of the stagnating Big Pharma stocks is most likely to break out? Merck looks to have the best chances after 17 years of stagnation, thanks to its oncology immune checkpoint inhibitor drug Keytruda. Already a blockbuster, continued approvals into new oncological indications are sure to expand its market. Keytruda has two important dates with the FDA next month. Beyond individual approvals for new indications, there is the longer term opportunity of using checkpoint inhibitors like Keytruda and Opdivo in combination with other cancer therapies, which Merck looks to be aggressively pursuing. In fact, Merck just got approval for Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy for lung cancer, causing shares to jump. On the very same day Merck announced a collaboration with OncoSec Medical Inc. (NASDAQ: ONCS) on combining Keytruda with OncoSec’s ImmunoPulse IL-12 electroporation melanoma therapy in a registrational Phase 2 trial. The goal is to expand Keytruda’s market dramatically to previous nonresponders, which make up 60% to 80% of the melanoma population. So while Americans aren’t spending that much more money on the same drugs, they are spending more money on new treatments that didn’t exist before. That’s why specialty pharma stocks are soaring and Big Pharma stocks, long term at least, are not. If Big Pharma companies are going to break out of their 17-year quagmire, it will be new specialty drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo that will be responsible for them turning the corner.

Photo: Mint Mumbai: Drug maker Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd’s consolidated net profit rose 23.5% in the quarter ended March on the back of sales of Zetia generic in the US, for which the company had a 180-day marketing exclusivity. On 12 December, 2016, Glenmark launched its generic version of Merck’s blockbuster cholesterol drug Zetia along with partner Endo International plc. Net profit for the March quarter stood at Rs183.76 crore, compared with Rs148.80 crore a year ago. Net sales were up 10.2% at Rs2,424.41 crore. “Our quarter performance was mainly driven by our US formulations business.

(NYSE: MRK)’s Keyruda for chemotherapy combination treatment of frontline lung cancer. While the approval was far from a surprise, it may be enough to move the needle for both Merck and rival Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE: BMY). BMO Capital raised its price target for Merck following the Keytruda approval from $71 to $74 and says Keytruda’s label is “solid.” “Based on our oncologist surveys, we expect strong uptake in IL-NSCLC given Keytruda’s broad label and significant market lead,” analyst Alex Arfaei explained. BMO is predicting roughly $4 billion in Keytruda sales in 2017, ahead of Wall Street consensus expectations of $3.5 billion. BMO forecasts sales will hit $10 billion in 2020 compared to consensus expectations of only $7 billion.

JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said Bristol-Myers shares could be under pressure in coming days, but the company has some promising candidates in its pipeline as well. “We continue to see positive CM-227 data as a key catalyst for shares and see a high probability of success for at least some portions of the pivotal Ph. III CM-227 study given solid phase I data and enhancements made to the design of the trial over time,” Schott explained. JPMorgan predicts “fairly rapid adoption within the labeled indication” for Keytruda. The firm forecasts 2017 Keytruda sales of $3.6 billion and predicts sales will hit $7.5 billion by 2020.

Thursday, May 11, 2017 by: Tracey Watson Tags: autism, MMR, National vaccine Injury Compensation Program, Somali-Americans, Somalis, vaccination, vaccine damage, vaccines (Natural News) The mainstream media’s ability to add 1 and 1 and get 5 never ceases to amaze me. The latest example of this is an article from CNN entitled “Anti-vaccine groups blamed in Minnesota measles outbreak.” The article is peppered with so many misleading and one-sided statements that it is necessary to break it down and examine each assertion individually. The article reports on the fact that there has been a measles “outbreak” in Minnesota in the Hennepin, Ramsey and Crow Wing counties. As of May 9, 48 people had been affected, 41 of them Somali-American, with 45 not having been vaccinated. The problem, according to the article, is that there is widespread skepticism about vaccines in the Somali community. The reason for this, it should be noted, is that in 2008, parents in this community started noticing that a “disproportionate” number of their children were being diagnosed with autism. The article goes on to proudly proclaim that between 2000 and 2008, the Somali community had some of the highest vaccination rates of any population in the state, and then bemoans the fact that this new fear of autism caused those rates to drop off dramatically after that year. And that’s the first example of the 1 and 1 being 5: How can the writer not put together the fact that before 2008 this population had some of the highest vaccination rates, with the fact that in 2008 they started noticing some of the highest autism rates? Those dots never get joined in the article, though in reading it, I was immediately struck by the glaring “coincidence.” Our friendly mainstream journalist then goes on to say that this poor community has fallen victim to anti-vaxxers like the “discredited” Dr. Andrew Wakefield, who was one of the first to publish literature regarding the link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Though the scientific community basically threw him and his work under the proverbial bus, claiming that his work was flawed, Health Impact News reports that his work has subsequently been replicated in at least 28 other studies! And it’s important to note that no court of law has ever won a case against Dr. Wakefield. And even if you want to leave the now controversial Dr. Wakefield out of the equation, what about the eminent scientist who was granted official whistleblower status by President Obama, and who still maintains his position as a senior epidemiologist at the CDC, Dr. William Thompson? Dr. Thompson co-authored a study on the MMR vaccine back in 2004. In that same year, he sent a letter to then-CDC director Julie Gerberding expressing his concern that a link between the MMR vaccine and a staggering 340 percent increase in autism risk for African American boys receiving the vaccine under the age of 3 was being concealed by the agency. Again, this dovetails perfectly with the fact that so many presumably African-American Somali children were being diagnosed with autism until they stopped vaccinating. Interestingly, Julie Gerberding is now president of Merck’s vaccine division, and the CDC purchases $4 billion in vaccines from vaccine companies, including Merck, each year. Anyone else struck by the glaring conflict of interest here? Another really annoying statement in the CNN article is this one by Kristen Ehresmann, director of the Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Prevention and Control Division at the Minnesota Department of Health: “We shouldn’t be spending hundreds of thousands of public health dollars to battle an outbreak that doesn’t need to be. We collectively can prevent these things from happening by vaccinating.” [Emphasis added] So, the public is being fleeced of hundreds of thousands of dollars by these vaccine skeptics who refuse to vaccinate their kids? Well, what about the millions of dollars awarded to parents of vaccine-damaged children by the government’s Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP)? Where did that money come from, if not from taxes? And why does such a program even exist, if the government and its agencies are truly convinced that vaccines are the salvation of man and don’t cause any harm? The clear, unbiased facts are these: The mumps, measles and rubella vaccines were lumped together into one MMR vaccine in 1971; In 1980, one-in-10,000 children was diagnosed with autism; In 2013, one-in 50 children was diagnosed with autism. The mainstream media can vilify people like Dr. Thompson and Dr. Wakefield all they want, but the fact is, vaccines really are linked to an increase in autism, and the American people are starting to finally wake up to this fact, despite the incessant media lies.

PD-L1 inhibitor Tecentriq (atezolizumab) was granted accelerated approval by the FDA for urothelial carcinoma (UC) - the most common form of bladder cancer - a year ago on the back of phase II data. The US regulator allows an early green light on the understanding that a phase III trial is carried out to confirm the mid-stage findings. Now Roche has revealed that its phase III IMVigor 211 failed to meet the primary endpoint of extending overall survival compared with chemotherapy, which the company put down to an unusually high response rate for the chemo arm of the trial. Roche targeted bladder cancer as its first indication for Tecentriq allowing it to launch without direct competition from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck & Co, the first companies to bringPD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors to market. The tactic was a success allowing the drug to rack up sales of around $270m in its first 12 months on the market, split roughly two thirds to one third between bladder and lung cancer, its second major indication. More than $100m of that came in the first quarter of this year. Now, Roche is facing the possibility that its conditional approval could be revoked at a time when other drugs in the class - BMS' Opdivo (nivolumab), Merck KGaA/Pfizer's Bavencio (avelumab), AstraZeneca's Imfinzi (durvalumab) - have already claimed approvals in bladder cancer and Merck & Co's Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is just weeks away from a regulatory verdict in that indication. The failure leaves the FDA with a thorny problem. If it were to revoke Tecentriq's second-line use in UC, the drug still has first-line approval for chemotherapy-ineligible patients with that type of cancer with confirmatory trial results (from the IMvigor130 study) not due until 2019, according to Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez. It's worth noting that all the checkpoint inhibitors have been approved or sought conditional approval on the basis of phase II data showing tumour responses rather than survival data, although Merck has since published results for Keytruda showing a survival advantage. With one win and one fail in confirmatory bladder cancer trials it's hard to draw any conclusions about the implications of the IMVigor211 failure on the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, other than to show they may have limitations - as witnessed by Opdivo's spectacular failure in first-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) last year. For now Roche is keeping quiet about what must have been a shocking revelation, other than to insist it Tecentriq's role in bladder cancer isn't finished. "While these results are not what we had expected, we believe that Tecentriq will continue to play an important role in the treatment of people with advanced bladder cancer," said the company's chief medical officer Sandra Horning. "We are committed to helping people with advanced bladder cancer and will discuss these data with health authorities." Please enable JavaScript to view the comments.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 11 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Immunovaccine Announces Financial Results for Quarter Ended March 31, 2017 /EINPresswire.com/ — HALIFAX, NOVA SCOTIA–(Marketwired – May 10, 2017) – Immunovaccine Inc. (TSX:IMV)(OTCQX:IMMVF), a clinical stage immuno-oncology company, today released its financial and operational results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. „Immunovaccine’s accomplishments this quarter underscore our clinical strategy, which is to focus on combination immuno-oncology therapies incorporating our lead candidate, DPX-Survivac,” said Frederic Ors, Immunovaccine’s Chief Executive Officer. „Our objective is to confirm preliminary observations that DPX-Survivac may work synergistically to increase the vulnerability of hard-to-treat tumors, improving the anti-cancer responses of today’s best monotherapies, including anti-PD-1 agents. From our announcement of the early data in our triple combination immuno-therapy with Incyte, to the planned Phase 2 trial in combination with Merck’s leading anti-PD 1 drug, we were pleased to show how our lead candidate, DPX-Survivac, achieved several milestones on the path to addressing an important unmet medical need.” Operational Highlights of the First Quarter 2017 Include: Investigator-led Phase 2 trial of ovarian cancer vaccine, DPX-Survivac, to begin – Immunovaccine announced that University Health Network’s Princess Margaret Cancer Centre would be initiating a Phase 2 triple combination study evaluating the safety and efficacy of the Company’s lead clinical candidate, DPX-Survivac, with Merck’s currently marketed anti-PD-1 drug, pembrolizumab, and low-dose cyclophosphamide in advanced ovarian cancer patients. Positive early data from our ongoing Phase 1b study of DPX-Survivac – Immunovaccine announced positive interim clinical data from its Phase 1b triple-combination study of DPX Survivac, in combination with Incyte’s epacadostat and low-dose cyclophosphamide, for the treatment of ovarian cancer. The data set has provided an encouraging first clinical demonstration of DPX-Survivac’s ability to activate T cells and help improve tumor response rates among cancers previously unresponsive to monotherapies. Pierre Labbé, joins the leadership team as CFO – Immunovaccine appointed financial veteran Pierre Labbé, CPA, CA, ICD, as its new chief financial officer (CFO) supporting the Company’s financing and business development operations.

S. general retailers index was off 1.2 percent. U.S. stocks trimmed losses on Thursday, but were still on track for their biggest one-day fall in nearly a month due to declines in retail and bank shares. Macy's dismal quarterly performance sent its shares tumbling 13 percent, taking a toll on the consumer discretionary sector, which fell 1 percent with all of its components in the red. The Dow Jones U.S. general retailers index was off 1.2 percent. Investors will get more insight into the U.S. retail sector on Friday when the Commerce Department issues its April retail sales report. Financials were off 0.87 percent as losses in Wells Fargo and Bank of America weighed.

Strong corporate earnings, robust economic data and expectations of fiscal stimulus in the United States have lifted Wall Street to record highs.

Continue Reading Below Macy's dismal quarterly performance sent its shares tumbling 17 percent, taking a toll on the consumer discretionary sector, which fell 0.59 percent. Kohl's dropped 7.86 percent after it reported a drop in quarterly sales, while shares of Nordstrom and J.C. Penney Co Inc each dropped more than 7 percent. "The brick-and-mortar are getting hurt probably more than anybody would have expected," said Anthony Conroy, President of Abel Noser in New York. The weak corporate reports left investors looking to April retail sales data due out on Friday for signs of whether consumers are simply shifting their spending habits away from department stores, or just aren't spending. "It's a gut check about the health of the consumer," said Phil Blancato, Chief Executive of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management. "It's a canary in the coalmine moment." Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors declined. Financials fell 0.53 percent, weighed down by a 1.79-percent loss in Wells Fargo. "Any market pullback, if orderly, (is) healthy as long as the underlying fundamentals for the market are strong," said Matthew Peterson, chief wealth strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.11 percent to end at 20,919.42 points and the S&P 500 lost or 0.22 percent to 2,394.44. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.22 percent to 6,115.96. Shares of Snap Inc plunged 21.45 percent after the Snapchat owner reported a slowdown in user growth and revenue in its first earnings report as a publicly-listed company. Straight Path fell 20.41 percent after it agreed to be taken over by Verizon in a $3.1 billion deal, snubbing a rival offer from AT&T. Merck rose 0.77 percent after the U.S. FDA cleared its lung cancer combination treatment. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.58-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.73-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 16 new 52-week highs and 9 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 92 new highs and 65 new lows. About 6.7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, in line with the daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Macy's dismal quarterly performance sent its shares tumbling 13 percent, taking a toll on the consumer discretionary sector, which fell 1 percent with all of its components in the red. Financials were off 0.87 percent as losses in Wells Fargo and Bank of America weighed. "Any market pullback, if orderly, are healthy as long as the underlying fundamentals for the market are strong," said Matthew Peterson, chief wealth strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina. At 10:56 a.m. ET (1456 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 117.7 points, or 0.56 percent, at 20,825.41, the S&P 500 was down 14.69 points, or 0.61 percent, at 2,384.94 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 46.58 points, or 0.76 percent, at 6,082.57. Strong corporate earnings, robust economic data and expectations of fiscal stimulus in the United States have lifted Wall Street to record highs. "We've seen participation in the market broadening, in terms of industries and the number of stocks, and that is a healthy thing," Peterson said. All of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with energy and consumer staples bringing up the rear. Shares of Snapchat owner Snap Inc plunged 20 percent after the company reported a slowdown in user growth and revenue in its first earnings report as a public company. Straight Path fell 20 percent after it agreed to be taken over by Verizon in a $3.1 billion deal, snubbing an offer from AT&T. Merck was the top stock on the S&P and the Dow, up 1.5 percent after the U.S. FDA cleared its lung cancer combination treatment. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 2,045 to 742. On the Nasdaq, 2,024 issues fell and 623 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed eight 52-week highs and nine lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 42 highs and 43 lows.

Macy's dismal quarterly performance sent its shares tumbling 13 percent, taking a toll on the consumer discretionary sector, which fell 1 percent with all of its components in the red. Financials were off 0.87 percent as losses in Wells Fargo and Bank of America weighed. "Any market pullback, if orderly, are healthy as long as the underlying fundamentals for the market are strong," said Matthew Peterson, chief wealth strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina. At 10:56 a.m. ET (1456 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 117.7 points, or 0.56 percent, at 20,825.41, the S&P 500 was down 14.69 points, or 0.61 percent, at 2,384.94 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 46.58 points, or 0.76 percent, at 6,082.57. Strong corporate earnings, robust economic data and expectations of fiscal stimulus in the United States have lifted Wall Street to record highs. "We've seen participation in the market broadening, in terms of industries and the number of stocks, and that is a healthy thing," Peterson said. All of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with energy and consumer staples bringing up the rear. Shares of Snapchat owner Snap Inc plunged 20 percent after the company reported a slowdown in user growth and revenue in its first earnings report as a public company. Straight Path fell 20 percent after it agreed to be taken over by Verizon in a $3.1 billion deal, snubbing an offer from AT&T. Merck was the top stock on the S&P and the Dow, up 1.5 percent after the U.S. FDA cleared its lung cancer combination treatment. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 2,045 to 742. On the Nasdaq, 2,024 issues fell and 623 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed eight 52-week highs and nine lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 42 highs and 43 lows.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 11 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Xencor’s Lead Drug Candidate, XmAb5871, Receives Orphan Drug Designation from FDA for Treatment of IgG4-Related Disease MONROVIA, Calif., May 11, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Xencor, Inc. (NASDAQ: XNCR), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing engineered monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, asthma and allergic diseases and cancer, announced today that XmAb®5871 has been granted orphan drug designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of IgG4-Related Disease (IgG4-RD), a newly defined fibro-inflammatory autoimmune disorder that is estimated to impact up to 40,000 patients in the United States. „There currently are no approved therapies for IgG4-RD, an immune-mediated condition responsible for fibro-inflammatory lesions that can lead to irreversible damage to virtually any organ,” said Bassil Dahiyat, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of Xencor. „New treatment options are clearly needed, and we are diligently moving XmAb5871 forward in clinical development to fill this void. Preliminary data from our Phase 2 study of XmAb5871 showed promising activity in patients with IgG4-RD, and we are on track to complete the study and report topline results by the end of this year.  We are also planning to engage the FDA later this year to discuss future clinical trials and potential registration requirements in IgG4-RD.” The FDA’s Orphan Drug Designation program provides orphan status to drugs defined as those intended for the safe and effective treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. Orphan designation qualifies the sponsor of the drug for certain development incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing, prescription drug user fee exemptions and seven-year marketing exclusivity upon FDA approval. About XmAb®5871 XmAb®5871 is a first-in-class monoclonal antibody that targets CD19 with its variable domain and that uses Xencor’s XmAb immune inhibitor Fc domain to target FcγRIIb, a receptor that inhibits B-cell function. XmAb5871 is the first drug candidate that Xencor is aware of that targets FcγRIIb inhibition. Xencor has demonstrated in multiple animal models and in initial human clinical trials that XmAb5871 inhibits B-cell function without destroying these important immune cells. Preliminary Phase 2 data presented at the American College of Rheumatology 2016 Annual Meeting showed that 82 percent of patients who received XmAb5871 achieved an initial response to therapy within 2 weeks of their first dose with responses deepening over time. About IgG4-Related Disease  IgG4-Related Disease (IgG4-RD) is a rare fibro-inflammatory autoimmune disorder responsible for fibro-inflammatory lesions that can lead to irreversible damage to virtually any organ. IgG4-RD is estimated to impact up to 40,000 patients in the United States. The disease affects multiple organ systems and is characterized by a distinct microscopic appearance of diseased organs, including the presence of IgG4-positive plasmablast cells. This objective diagnostic criterion is atypical for autoimmune diseases and offers advantages for accurately identifying patients. There are currently no approved therapies for this newly recognized disorder and corticosteroids are the current standard of care. About Xencor, Inc. Xencor is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing engineered monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, asthma and allergic diseases and cancer. Currently, 11 candidates engineered with Xencor’s XmAb® technology are in clinical development internally and with partners. Xencor’s internal programs include: XmAb®5871 in Phase 2 development for the treatment of IgG4-Related Disease, and also for the treatment of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus; XmAb®7195 in Phase 1 development for the treatment of asthma and allergic diseases; XmAb®14045 in Phase 1 development for acute myeloid leukemia; XmAb®13676 in Phase 1 development for B-cell malignancies; XmAb®18087 in pre-clinical development for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors; and XmAb®20717 in pre-clinical development for the treatment of multiple cancers. Xencor’s XmAb antibody engineering technology enables small changes to the structure of monoclonal antibodies resulting in new mechanisms of therapeutic action.  Xencor partners include Novartis, Amgen, MorphoSys, Merck, CSL/Janssen, Alexion and Boehringer Ingelheim.

XmAb5871 is the first drug candidate that Xencor is aware of that targets FcγRIIb inhibition. Xencor has demonstrated in multiple animal models and in initial human clinical trials that XmAb5871 inhibits B-cell function without destroying these important immune cells. Preliminary Phase 2 data presented at the American College of Rheumatology 2016 Annual Meeting showed that 82 percent of patients who received XmAb5871 achieved an initial response to therapy within 2 weeks of their first dose with responses deepening over time. About IgG4-Related Disease  IgG4-Related Disease (IgG4-RD) is a rare fibro-inflammatory autoimmune disorder responsible for fibro-inflammatory lesions that can lead to irreversible damage to virtually any organ. IgG4-RD is estimated to impact up to 40,000 patients in the United States. The disease affects multiple organ systems and is characterized by a distinct microscopic appearance of diseased organs, including the presence of IgG4-positive plasmablast cells. This objective diagnostic criterion is atypical for autoimmune diseases and offers advantages for accurately identifying patients. There are currently no approved therapies for this newly recognized disorder and corticosteroids are the current standard of care. About Xencor, Inc. Xencor is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing engineered monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, asthma and allergic diseases and cancer. Currently, 11 candidates engineered with Xencor’s XmAb® technology are in clinical development internally and with partners. Xencor’s internal programs include: XmAb®5871 in Phase 2 development for the treatment of IgG4-Related Disease, and also for the treatment of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus; XmAb®7195 in Phase 1 development for the treatment of asthma and allergic diseases; XmAb®14045 in Phase 1 development for acute myeloid leukemia; XmAb®13676 in Phase 1 development for B-cell malignancies; XmAb®18087 in pre-clinical development for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors; and XmAb®20717 in pre-clinical development for the treatment of multiple cancers. Xencor’s XmAb antibody engineering technology enables small changes to the structure of monoclonal antibodies resulting in new mechanisms of therapeutic action.  Xencor partners include Novartis, Amgen, MorphoSys, Merck, CSL/Janssen, Alexion and Boehringer Ingelheim.

Check out which companies are making headlines before the bell: Straight Path Communications — Straight Path announced a deal to be bought by Verizon for $184 per share in stock. The company has ended its prior deal to be bought by AT&T and said AT&T would not be making any new bids. Snap — The Snapchat parent posted a loss of 20 cents per share for its first quarterly report since going public in March. That was one cent a share wider than expected. Revenue also fell short of forecasts. Investors are focusing on weaker-than-expected user growth, with its smallest year-over-year additions in at least two years. 21st Century Fox — Fox beat estimates by six cents a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of 54 cents per share. The media company's revenue was slightly below Street forecasts, primarily due to weaker-than-expected results at Fox's film division. Whole Foods — Whole Foods matched forecasts, with adjusted quarterly profit of 37 cents per share. The grocery chain's revenue was essentially in line, as well. The company also confirmed earlier reports of changes to its board, appointing five new independent directors, naming a new board chair and new CFO. The grocer also increased its quarterly dividend by 29 percent. Kohl's — The retailer earned an adjusted 39 cents per share for the first quarter, 10 cents a share above estimates. Revenue fell short of expectations, and same-store sales slid more than expected. However, Kohl's was helped by less discounting and higher customer traffic. Teva Pharmaceutical — The drugmaker beat estimates by three cents a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.06 per share. Revenue was shy of Street forecasts. Teva said it is facing challenges in the U.S. generics market and from instability in Venezuela but is reaffirming its prior full-year forecast. Parexel — Activist investor Starboard has taken a 5.7 percent stake in the contract research company, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Earlier, The Wall Street Journal reported that Starboard thinks the company could attract significant interest from potential buyers. U.S. Steel — Chief Executive Officer Mario Longhi has stepped down, replaced by Chief Operating Officer and President David Burritt. Longhi will remain on the board until his retirement on June 30. Longhi's departure comes just a few weeks after the steelmaker cut its 2017 profit outlook in half and reported an unexpected first-quarter loss. GlaxoSmithKline — The drugmaker's shares could get a boost after Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulators turned down a second request by U.S.-based Hikma Pharmaceuticals to market a generic version of GSK's best-selling lung drug Advair. Aegon — Aegon posted a stronger than expected first-quarter profit, boosted by a strong investment portfolio performance. The insurer is based in Amsterdam but does most of its business in the U.S. AIG — The insurance company plans to name Brian Duperreault as its new CEO, with an announcement coming as soon as today according to The Wall Street Journal. Duperreault is a one-time lieutenant to former AIG CEO Maurice "Hank" Greenberg. Aetna — Aetna will exit the two remaining states – Delaware and Nebraska – where it has been participating in the Obamacare insurance exchanges because of losses from its participation. Merck — Merck received FDA approval to market its cancer drug Keytruda for the new use of adding it to chemotherapy to treat lung cancer. Symantec — Symantec matched estimates with adjusted quarterly profit of 28 cents per share, with revenue also in line. The maker of cybersecurity and anti-virus software also gave a current-quarter forecast that fell below consensus estimates, however. CEO Greg Clark told Dow Jones that with the integration of new businesses like Blue Coat and LifeLock, more of Symantec's revenue is deferred, which will improve future quarters. Home Depot — The home improvement retailer's stock was downgraded to "neutral" from "overweight" in a valuation call, although the firm increased its price target to $168 per share from $164. The stock is up 18 percent so far this year. Yum Brands — The restaurant chain was upgraded by Goldman Sachs to "neutral" from "sell," based in part on an increasingly positive view of results at Yum's Taco Bell chain.

BRD in cattle caused by a range of factors, singly or in combination. A major cause of economic losses, BRD affects the lower respiratory tract / lungs (pneumonia) or upper respiratory tract (rhinitis, tracheitis, bronchitis). It is a complex, bacterial infection that causes pneumonia in calves and can possibly be fatal. The infection is usually a sum of three codependent factors: Stress, an underlying viral infection, and a new bacterial infection. BRD is a „multi-factorial syndrome” that is dependent on a number of different causes. The bacterial agents most commonly linked with BRD are Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, and Mycoplasma bovis. Viral agents include Bovine Viral Diarrhea (BVD), Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR), Bovine Respiratory Synctial Virus (BRSV), and Parainfluenza Type-3 Virus (PI-3). Antibiotics such as Micotil, Nuflor, and Baytril 100, Naxcel, Excenel, and Adspec can help to stop the bacterial factors of the disease. Vaccines are available for a number of viral/bacterial agents, including IBR, PI3, BVD, BRSV, Pasteurella, and Haemophilius somnus. Banamine is an anti-inflammatory drug which helps reduce fever and damage to the lungs, and therefore may help sick calves get back on feed quicker. Vitamin B and Probiotics can be used to help stimulate appetite.

Macy's dismal quarterly performance sent its shares tumbling 13 percent, taking a toll on the consumer discretionary sector, which fell 1 percent with all of its components in the red. The Dow Jones US general retailers index was off 1.2 percent. Investors will get more insight into the US retail sector on Friday when the Commerce Department issues its April retail sales report. Financials were off 0.87 percent as losses in Wells Fargo and Bank of America weighed. "Any market pullback, if orderly, are healthy as long as the underlying fundamentals for the market are strong," said Matthew Peterson, chief wealth strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Bioburden testing, also known as microbial limit testing provides quantification of the bacterial cell cultures on a given unsterilized surface. The major application of bioburden testing lies in implant fixation procedures that require testing ofcertain tolerable bioburden limit before implantation in the human body. The standard for bioburden testing in the US is regulated by the US FDA, whereas global standards are maintained by the ISO (International Organization for Standardization). The quantification for the standardization process is done in terms of colony forming unit (CFU). Bioburden testing is essential in limiting the presence of infection causing bacteria in an object that is to be integrated into a human body as an implant. The testing is important to eliminate the presence of bacterial residue and growth in any object present in natural state. In addition it is almost impossible to remove bacterial residue permanently in an object that is liable to be exposed to open air. Hence sterilization process is performed on an implant object or a device post understanding the bioburden limit. This helps to select the appropriate sterilization technique in order to remove the bacterial burden just prior to the medical (Or other related) procedure. Bioburden testing has therefore saved numerous lives. Based on technology, bioburden testing is segmented into microbial filter method, advanced colorimetric method, and plate count method. Among these, microbial filter method is the most commonly used method for bioburden testing procedures. The plate count method is among the oldest methods for bioburden testing, however is not used regularly on a large scale commercial basis due to its time consuming procedure. Advanced colorimetric method is presently the most promising and widely used bioburden testing technology. The congregation of colometer and computational capabilities has enabled advanced colometric methods to deliver quick results of quantifying bioburden. View Report- http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/bioburden-testing-market.html Based on equipment, bioburden testing market can be segmented into PCR (polymerase chain reaction) instruments, cell counters, and automated microbial identification systems that are software integrated. Application segment for bioburden testing includes healthcare, aerospace (satellite production & development), supercomputer (super- microprocessor manufacturing) designing, and others (raw material, equipment cleaning, food & beverage). The healthcare industry is the largest application area of bioburden testing. Geographically, the bioburden testing market is primarily concentrated in the North America and Asia Pacific region. The demand for bioburden testing in the Asia Pacific region is expected to grow, and very likely to replace the North America market soon. Australia, Japan, and China form the largest markets in the Asia Pacific region. South Asia and South East Asia on the other hand show great potential in terms of life sciences and raw material applications; although at present a majority of the growing bioburden testing market consists of life science applications. Besides this, a large number of contract manufacturers reside in the Asia Pacific region. On the other hand, European industries continue to remain a strong point in the global bioburden testing market mainly due to the high quality of products services offered, presence of numerous quality manufacturers and their increased reliability. However certain significant restrictions for bioburden testing remains valid in the European and North American region, such as dearth of trained technicians, overwhelming volume of service demand, and high cost of services, to name a few. The bio-burden testing market in the Rest of the World (ROW) region is expected to grow at a steady rate, albeit slower than the major economies of the world. Some of the well known manufacturers/service providers of bioburden testing equipment/service include: Charles River Laboratories International, Inc., Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, SGS S.A., WuXi PharmaTech (Cayman), and Inc., Merck & Co., Inc., Becton, Dickinson and Company, North American Science Associates, Inc., Nelson Laboratories, Pacific Biolabs, and ATS Labs, Inc.
