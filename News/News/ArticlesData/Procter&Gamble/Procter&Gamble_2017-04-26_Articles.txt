The folks at Procter & Gamble sure are. The parent company of Charmin toilet paper delivered a truckload of the squeezably soft product to him in his hometown of Pickerington, Ohio, on Wednesday. The nature of the relationship between P&G and Butt is unclear. A request for comment was emailed to P&G. The gesture surely was a nod to Butt's last name, which elicits snickers wherever he goes. He embraces it. "I love it so much," he told ESPN last August. "I think that's one of my greatest traits. It has really allowed me to grow my platform and build my brand." Butt has made a name for himself as a football player for being a two-time Big Ten tight end of the year. He's one of the top players at his position available for the NFL draft, which starts Thursday. On Tuesday, Charmin tweeted , "Have you seen the #CharminDumpTruck driving through? We've got a special destination for a butt-load of TP" On Wednesday, a Columbus radio station, 97.1 The Fan, tweeted a picture of the load of toilet paper being dropped on a lawn with Butt standing nearby. ___ More AP college football: www.collegefootball.ap.org 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

X Profits fall at maker of Ariel detergent and Gillette razors Slowdown in market growth, geopolitical uncertainty and a stronger dollar blamed about 19 hours ago P&G has said it plans to save as much as $10 billion in costs over the next five years         Procter & Gamble, the maker of Ariel detergent and Gillette razors, reported an 8.3 per cent fall in third-quarter profit, citing a slowdown in market growth, geopolitical uncertainty and a stronger dollar. Net income attributable to the Cincinnati, Ohio-based company declined to $2.52 billion, or 93 cents per share, in the three months ended March 31st, from $2.75 billion, or 97 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, P&G earned 96 cents, beating the average analyst estimate of 94 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The consumer goods giant, whose iconic brands include Tide, Pampers, Head-and-Shoulders and Vicks, said net sales fell about 1 per cent to $15.61 billion - the thirteenth straight quarter of declines. Analysts had been looking for $15.73 billion. P&G’s quarterly sales have fallen for more than three years due to the company cutting its brand portfolio. The company has been selling off unprofitable brands and focusing on core brands such as Tide and Pampers to revive sluggish sales. It sold 41 of its brands, including Clairol and Wella, to Coty in a $12.5 billion deal in October. P&G, which traces its roots to a family-run candle and soap business in 1837, maintained expectations of a mid-single digit rise in full-year adjusted earnings per share growth, and a 2-3 per cent increase in organic sales growth. The company’s stock, which has jumped 10.6 per cent in the past year, was down 0.7 per cent in premarket trading. P&G has said it plans to save as much as $10 billion in costs over the next five years, and use a chunk of these savings to improve packaging, research and development, and sales coverage. -Bloomberg       Topics: Procter and Gamble Cincinnati Read More Ardagh to appeal $50m patent infringement order Wicklow job losses as Rennicks sells signs business to UK rival US judge hands Volkswagen three-year probation sentence GE cash flow turns negative in first quarter Ecocem appeal over €45m California mill to be heard next month European car sales in March rise but Irish sales less buoyant Akzo Nobel to sell or spin off chemicals division Harley-Davidson reports slowing sales C&C chief transfers €15.4m stake to family company Profits dip at Irish arm of consumer products group Procter & Gamble  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Financial Services New lending up at AIB as impaired loans decline by €500m Technology Review: Is the iKettle 2.0 worth the investment?

The maker of Tide detergent and Head & Shoulders shampoo reported earnings in its fiscal third-quarter of US$2.5 billion (RM10.9 billion), down 8.3 per cent. Revenues were US$15.6 billion, down 1.0 per cent. “The third quarter macro environment was characterised by a slowdown in market growth, continued geopolitical disruptions and foreign exchange challenges,” said chief executive David Taylor. P&G’s strongest division as far as revenues was health care, the only division with net sales growth, where results were boosted by strong sales in power toothbrushes and oral products. The weakest business was grooming, which has seen diminished demand for shaving products as beards and facial hair have become more popular.

Check out which companies are making headlines before the bell: Boeing — The jet maker reported profit of $2.01 per share, seven cents a share above estimates. Revenue was slightly below forecasts, and the company reported much better-than-expected free cash flow figures for the quarter. United Technologies — The maker of Pratt & Whitney jet engines came in nine cents a share above estimates, with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.48 per share. Revenue was also above forecasts and the company saw higher sales in all four of its business units. Procter & Gamble — The consumer products giant reported adjusted quarterly profit of 96 cents per share, two cents a share above estimates. Revenue was slightly below forecasts. P&G is citing a stronger dollar and political uncertainty among the factors holding back its results. Twitter — Twitter earned an adjusted 11 cents per share for the first quarter, 10 cents a share above estimates. Revenue was well above Street forecasts, and Twitter added more daily active users than analysts had anticipated. PepsiCo — The beverage and snack giant beat estimates by two cents a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of 94 cents per share. Revenue also beat forecast. The results were aided by stronger pricing, although PepsiCo is giving a full-year earnings forecast that falls slightly below estimates. Anthem — The health insurer reported adjusted quarterly profit of $4.68 per share, well above estimates of $3.86. Revenue was above forecasts and Anthem gave a better-than-expected earnings and revenue forecast for the full year, helped by increased enrollment in its government-related businesses. Restaurant Brands International — The parent of Tim Hortons and Burger King reported adjusted quarterly profit of 36 cents per share, one cent a share above estimates. Revenue was also above forecasts and the company increased its quarterly dividend by 5.6 percent. AT&T — AT&T matched Street forecasts with adjusted quarterly profit of 74 cents per share, however revenue fell short of estimates.

Wynn Resorts — Wynn exceeded estimates by 23 cents a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.24 per share. The hotel and casino operator also posted a slight beat on the top line. Wynn's results have been helped in recent quarters by a recovery in its Macau operations. Arconic — The engineered products maker reported adjusted quarterly profit of 33 cents per share, nine cents a share above estimates, helped by strength in transportation and rolled products. Panera Bread — Panera saw its quarterly profits match Street forecasts, with adjusted earnings of $1.83 per share.

Deckers Outdoor — Deckers is exploring strategic alternatives, with the footwear maker hiring Moelis & Co. as a financial advisor. Activist investors have been urging the maker of UGG boots to look at a possible sale of the company. U.S. Steel — The company posted an adjusted loss of 83 cents per share, surprising analysts who had expected the steelmaker to report a quarterly profit. Revenue also missed estimates and the company gave weaker-than-expected 2017 guidance. U.S. Steel said operating challenges at some of its factories kept it from fully benefiting from improved market conditions. Costco — Costco announced a $7 per share special dividend, payable on May 26 to shareholders of record on May 10. The warehouse retailer also raised its regular quarterly dividend to 50 cents per share from 45 cents.

Additionally, iRobot raised its full-year earnings and revenue guidance above current consensus estimates.

Tyson Foods — Tyson is considering raising wages for its poultry plant workers, on top of a 3 percent to 3.5 percent wage hike that it gave workers in November. The company is considering the move to deal with a tightening labor market. McDonald's — McDonald's is dropping its plan to sell shares in its Japan operations, which recently returned to profitability after three years of losses.

Consumer packaged goods is a fast-paced, competitive marketplace in which most purchase decisions are made in a matter of seconds.  Companies must quickly deliver new materials, formulations and packaging that distinguish a product in the marketplace, contribute to a strong and reliable brand image, and inspire consumers to make – and repeat – a purchase.  P&G, a longtime customer of Dassault Systèmes’ design, development and simulation applications, manages 10 product categories and 65 brands in more than 80 countries.  The 3DEXPERIENCE platform helps P&G to leverage its scale with greater agility to innovate, efficiently manage and accelerate product programs in the context of short product lifecycles, fluctuating costs of raw materials, and highly variable consumer demand. “Our decision to upgrade our existing Dassault Systèmes’ PLM to the 3DEXPERIENCE platform is part of our work to digitally transform our business to support our work process digital transformation and drive value,” said Jean-Louis Hospitel, IT Director, P&G. “The 3DEXPERIENCE platform facilitates end-to-end innovation integration and improved user experience for our seamless technical community.” Based on the 3DEXPERIENCE platform, “Perfect Product” and “Perfect Package” are being extended across P&G to 18,000 users in research and development, product supply, quality and other disciplines to support the design and development of products.  In a global collaborative digital environment, project data is traceable, shareable and reusable.  Teams spend less time searching for data and have access to more consistent and accurate packaging and product specifications.  This streamlines processes and saves rework and expense.  In addition to this increased productivity, data can be exchanged easily with consumers to gain greater insight into trends, needs and usage.  “The 3DEXPERIENCE platform and our industry solution experiences for consumer packaged goods connect people, processes and systems.  As a result, companies can reduce product development time by up to 20 percent,” said Philippe Loeb, Vice President, Consumer Packaged Goods & Retail Industry, Dassault Systèmes.  “This is a major advantage in an industry that requires bigger, better and faster innovation from companies that have to constantly readjust business priorities in response to changing consumer habits.  Discovering and delivering the next breakthrough product becomes that much more efficient.” For more information on Dassault Systèmes’ industry solution experiences for consumer packaged goods and retail: http://www.3ds.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods-retail/ ### About Dassault Systèmes Dassault Systèmes, the 3DEXPERIENCE Company, provides business and people with virtual universes to imagine sustainable innovations.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 26 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman P&G Announces Third Quarter Earnings CINCINNATI–(BUSINESS WIRE)–The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) reported third quarter fiscal year 2017 net sales of $15.6 billion, a decrease of one percent versus the prior year. Organic sales increased one percent. Organic sales increased in four of five business segments. Diluted net earnings per share were $0.93, a decrease of four percent versus the prior year while core earnings per share increased 12% to $0.96. Currency-neutral core EPS increased 15% versus the prior year. Operating cash flow was $3.0 billion for the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 90%. The Company returned $1.8 billion of cash to shareholders as dividends and repurchased $2.0 billion of common stock. Earlier this month, P&G announced an increase in its quarterly dividend, marking the 61st consecutive year the Company has increased its dividend. P&G has been paying a dividend for 127 consecutive years since its incorporation in 1890. “The third quarter macro environment was characterized by a slowdown in market growth, continued geopolitical disruptions and foreign exchange challenges,” said David Taylor, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Against this backdrop, we delivered modest organic sales growth and double-digit Core EPS growth, and we increased the quarterly dividend for the 61st consecutive year. Looking forward, we are maintaining our organic sales and Core EPS guidance ranges for the year and increasing our outlook for adjusted free cash flow productivity.” January – March Quarter Discussion Net sales in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 were $15.6 billion, a decrease of one percent versus prior year, including a negative two percent impact from foreign exchange. Organic sales increased one percent driven by a one percent increase in organic shipment volume. Pricing and mix had no net impact on sales for the quarter.

Organic sales increased low single digits in Skin & Personal Care as the continued growth of the super-premium SK-II skin care brand offset lower volume in retail skin care. Organic sales in Hair Care were unchanged. Grooming segment organic sales decreased six percent due to lower volume and reduced pricing in Shave Care. Organic sales decreased high single digits globally in Shave Care due to competitive impacts in the U.S. Organic sales were up high single digits in Appliances driven by the continued success of innovation on Braun male shavers as well as styling tools. Health Care segment organic sales increased six percent behind higher organic volume in both Oral Care and Personal Health Care. Product innovation on power toothbrushes and continued marketing support drove a low single-digit increase in organic sales in Oral Care while Personal Health Care was up double digits due to market growth in the U.S. behind a strong cough & cold season along with increased pricing outside the U.S. Fabric and Home Care segment organic sales increased one percent versus year ago driven by higher organic volume in both Fabric Care and Home Care along with increased pricing in Fabric Care. Home Care organic sales decreased low single digits as increased volume due to product innovation and increased customer support was more than offset by unfavorable geographic mix. Fabric Care organic sales increased low single digits due to increased organic volume and favorable product mix from premium forms in developed markets and increased pricing in developing markets. Baby, Feminine and Family Care segment organic sales increased one percent driven by volume growth in Family Care and favorable mix in Feminine Care. Baby Care organic sales decreased low single digits due mainly to competitive activity. Feminine Care organic sales increased mid-single digits from favorable product mix due to Always Discrete premium innovation. Family Care organic sales grew low single digits driven primarily by product innovation and increased marketing support. Diluted net earnings per share were $0.93, a decrease of four percent versus the prior year. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were also $0.93, which is an increase of 15% versus the base period. Current year results included non-core restructuring charges of $0.03 per share. Core earnings per share, which exclude non-core restructuring charges, were $0.96, an increase of 12% versus the prior year. Currency-neutral core earnings per share increased 15% for the quarter. Reported gross margin was unchanged, including a 40 basis point decrease in non-core restructuring charges versus the prior year. Core gross margin decreased 40 basis points, including 20 basis points of negative foreign exchange impacts. On a currency-neutral basis, core gross margin decreased 20 basis points as 210 basis points of productivity savings were more than offset by 100 basis points of unfavorable geographic and product mix, 80 basis points of commodity cost increases and 50 basis points of product reinvestments and other impacts. Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) as a percent of sales decreased 40 basis points on a reported basis versus the prior year, including a 10 basis point net benefit from a year-on-year decline in non-core charges. Core SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased 30 basis points versus the prior year. Savings of 50 basis points from overhead and marketing productivity and a 110 basis point benefit in other operating income were partially offset by a 130 basis point impact from investments in marketing, sales resources, and research and development. Reported operating profit margin increased 40 basis points. Core operating profit margin decreased 10 basis points versus the prior year, including 20 basis points of foreign exchange impacts. On a currency-neutral basis, core operating profit margin increased 10 basis points including productivity cost savings of 260 basis points for the quarter. Fiscal Year 2017 Guidance P&G said it is maintaining its guidance for organic sales growth in the range of two to three percent for fiscal 2017. Fiscal year to date, the Company is at the low end of this range. The Company expects the combined headwinds of foreign exchange and minor brand divestitures to reduce sales growth by two to three percentage points. As a result, P&G estimates all-in sales to be down one percent to in-line with the prior fiscal year. The Company also maintained its expectation for core earnings per share growth of mid-single digits versus fiscal 2016 Core EPS of $3.67. All-in GAAP earnings per share are expected to increase 48% to 50% versus fiscal year 2016 GAAP EPS of $3.69. The fiscal 2017 GAAP EPS estimate includes approximately $0.12 per share of non-core restructuring costs and $0.13 per share of charges related to early debt retirement that was executed in the second quarter. Also included in GAAP EPS is the $1.95 gain from the divestiture of 41 Beauty Brands to Coty in a transaction that was completed in the second quarter. P&G said it is increasing fiscal year guidance for adjusted free cash flow productivity from 90% or more to approximately 95%.

118,091 $ 127,136   The Procter & Gamble Company Exhibit 1: Non-GAAP Measures In accordance with the SEC’s Regulation G, the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures used in Procter & Gamble’s April 26, 2017 earnings release and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measure. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measure, but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. The Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items: Incremental restructuring: The Company has had and continues to have an ongoing level of restructuring activities. Such activities have resulted in ongoing annual restructuring related charges of approximately $250 – $500 million before tax. Beginning in 2012 Procter & Gamble began a $10 billion strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that includes incremental restructuring activities. This results in incremental restructuring charges to accelerate productivity efforts and cost savings. The adjustment to Core earnings includes only the restructuring costs above what we believe are the normal recurring level of restructuring costs. Charges for certain European legal matters: Several countries in Europe issued separate complaints alleging that the Company, along with several other companies, engaged in violations of competition laws in prior periods. The Company established Legal Reserves related to these charges. Management does not view these charges as indicative of underlying business results. We do not view the above items to be part of our sustainable results and their exclusion from Core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation. Organic sales growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. Management believes this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. Core operating profit margin: Core operating profit margin is a measure of the Company’s operating margin adjusted for items as indicated. Management believes this non-GAAP measure provides a supplemental perspective to the Company’s operating efficiency over time. Core gross margin: Core gross margin is a measure of the Company’s gross margin adjusted for items as indicated. Management believes this non-GAAP measure provides a supplemental perspective to the Company’s operating efficiency over time. Core EPS and currency-neutral Core EPS: Core earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of the Company’s diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted as indicated. Currency-neutral Core EPS is a measure of the Company’s Core EPS excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management views these non-GAAP measures as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. Adjusted free cash flow: Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding tax payments related to the Beauty Brands divestiture, which are non-recurring and not considered indicative of underlying cash flow performance. Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. Management views adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends and discretionary investment. Adjusted free cash flow productivity: Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings. Management views adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. The Company’s long-term target is to generate annual adjusted free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent.   THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures Three Months Ended March 31, 2017   AS REPORTED   INCREMENTAL     NON-GAAP (GAAP) RESTRUCTURING ROUNDING (CORE) COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD 7,836 (113 ) 1 7,724 GROSS PROFIT 7,769 113 (1 ) 7,881 GROSS MARGIN 49.8 % 0.7 % — % 50.5 % SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE 4,409 22 (1 ) 4,430 SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AS A % OF NET SALES 28.3 % 0.1 % — % 28.4 % OPERATING INCOME 3,360 91 — 3,451 OPERATING PROFIT MARGIN 21.5 % 0.6 % — % 22.1 % INCOME TAX ON CONTINUING OPERATIONS 780 21 (1 ) 800 NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO P&G 2,522 70 — 2,592 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE 23.4 % — % — % 23.4 %             Core EPS DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE* 0.93     0.03     —     0.96   CURRENCY IMPACT TO CORE EARNINGS 0.03 CURRENCY-NEUTRAL CORE EPS   0.99   DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING 2,705.5 COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING AS OF MARCH 31, 2017 2,557.6 * Diluted net earnings per share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble.                   CHANGE VERSUS YEAR AGO         CORE GROSS MARGIN (40 ) BPS CORE SELLING GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AS A % OF NET SALES (30 ) BPS CORE OPERATING PROFIT MARGIN (10 ) BPS CORE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE (380 ) BPS CORE EPS 12 % CURRENCY-NEUTRAL CORE EPS 15 %     THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures Three Months Ended March 31, 2016         CHARGES FOR     AS REPORTED DISCONTINUED INCREMENTAL EUROPEAN LEGAL NON-GAAP (GAAP) OPERATIONS RESTRUCTURING MATTERS   ROUNDING (CORE) COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD 7,915 — (174 ) — — 7,741 GROSS PROFIT 7,840 — 174 — — 8,014 GROSS MARGIN 49.8 % — % 1.1 % — % — % 50.9 % SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE 4,522 — 14 (13 ) (1 ) 4,522 SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AS A % OF NET SALES 28.7 % — % 0.1 % (0.1 )% — % 28.7 % OPERATING INCOME 3,318 — 160 13 1 3,492 OPERATING PROFIT MARGIN 21.1 % — % 1.0 % 0.1 % — % 22.2 % INCOME TAX ON CONTINUING OPERATIONS 889 — 33 2 (1 ) 923 NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO P&G 2,750 (445 ) 127 11 — 2,443 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE 27.6 % — % (0.3 )% — % (0.1 )% 27.2 %                     Core EPS: DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE* 0.97     (0.16 )   0.04     —     0.01     0.86   DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING 2,835.0 * Diluted net earnings per share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble.      Organic sales growth:                       Foreign Exchange   Acquisition/   Organic Sales January – March 2017 Net Sales Growth Impact Divestiture Impact* Growth Beauty (2)% 1% 2% 1% Grooming (6)% —% —% (6)% Health Care 4% 1% 1% 6% Fabric & Home Care (1)% 2% —% 1% Baby, Feminine & Family Care   (1)%   1%   1%   1% Total P&G   (1)%   2%   —%   1%                   Combined Foreign Exchange &   Organic Sales Total P&G Net Sales Growth Acquisition/Divestiture Impact* Growth FY 2017 (Estimate)   -1% to Flat   Approximately 2% to 3%   2% to 3% * Acquisition/Divestiture Impact includes the mix impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales.      Core EPS:                 Diluted EPS     Total P&G Growth Impact of Incremental Non-Core Items* Core EPS Growth FY 2017 Up mid-single (Estimate)   Up 48% to 50%   Approximately (44%)   digits * Includes change in discontinued operations (includes gain on sale of Beauty Brands).      Adjusted free cash flow (dollar amounts in millions):   Three Months Ended March 31, 2017       Cash Tax Payment –   Adjusted Free Cash Operating Cash Flow Capital Spending Free Cash Flow Beauty Sale Flow $3,040   $(801)   $2,239   $74   $2,313      Adjusted free cash flow productivity (dollar amounts in millions) :   Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Adjusted Free Cash Flow   Net Earnings   Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity $2,313   $2,556   90% CategoriesUncategorized TagsUncategorized Post navigation Previous PostPrevious Sourdough Market Information, Figures and Analytical Insights 2016 – 2026 Next PostNext CE+T Power Introduces Full Bi-directionality for its Enhanced Conversion Innovation (ECI) technology Search Recent Posts Encapsulated Flavors And Fragrances Market Industry Analysis, Trend and Growth, 2017-2027 Oxidized Polyethylene Wax (OPE Wax) Market Report: Comprehensive Market and Vendor Landscape Including Latest Trends and Drivers Forecast 2022 2017 Asia-Pacific Ball Splines Industry Revenue Market Share Analysis: Market Shares, Analysis, and Index Global Flexible Display Market to be at Forefront by 2024 Oxazole Market 2022: Competition by Top Manufacturers, With Production, Revenue (Value) and Market Share Proudly powered by WordPress

Earlier this month, P&G announced an increase in its quarterly dividend, marking the 61st consecutive year the Company has increased its dividend. P&G has been paying a dividend for 127 consecutive years since its incorporation in 1890. “The third quarter macro environment was characterized by a slowdown in market growth, continued geopolitical disruptions and foreign exchange challenges,” said David Taylor, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Against this backdrop, we delivered modest organic sales growth and double-digit Core EPS growth, and we increased the quarterly dividend for the 61st consecutive year. Looking forward, we are maintaining our organic sales and Core EPS guidance ranges for the year and increasing our outlook for adjusted free cash flow productivity.” January - March Quarter Discussion Net sales in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 were $15.6 billion, a decrease of one percent versus prior year, including a negative two percent impact from foreign exchange. Organic sales increased one percent driven by a one percent increase in organic shipment volume. Pricing and mix had no net impact on sales for the quarter. All-in volume was unchanged including the impacts of minor brand divestitures.                                             January - March 2017     Foreign                     Organic   Organic Net Sales Drivers* Volume Exchange Price Mix Other** Net Sales Volume Sales Beauty (2)% (1)% 1% —% —% (2)% —% 1% Grooming —% —% (2)% (4)% —% (6)% —% (6)% Health Care 4% (1)% 1% 1% (1)% 4% 4% 6% Fabric & Home Care —% (2)% —% —% 1% (1)% 1% 1% Baby, Feminine & Family Care   1%   (1)%   —%   —%   (1)%   (1)%             1%   1% Total P&G   —%   (2)%   —%   —%   1%   (1)%             1%   1% * Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. ** Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions/divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales. Beauty segment organic sales increased one percent versus year ago behind growth in Skin & Personal Care. Organic sales increased low single digits in Skin & Personal Care as the continued growth of the super-premium SK-II skin care brand offset lower volume in retail skin care. Organic sales in Hair Care were unchanged. Grooming segment organic sales decreased six percent due to lower volume and reduced pricing in Shave Care. Organic sales decreased high single digits globally in Shave Care due to competitive impacts in the U.S. Organic sales were up high single digits in Appliances driven by the continued success of innovation on Braun male shavers as well as styling tools. Health Care segment organic sales increased six percent behind higher organic volume in both Oral Care and Personal Health Care. Product innovation on power toothbrushes and continued marketing support drove a low single-digit increase in organic sales in Oral Care while Personal Health Care was up double digits due to market growth in the U.S. behind a strong cough & cold season along with increased pricing outside the U.S. Fabric and Home Care segment organic sales increased one percent versus year ago driven by higher organic volume in both Fabric Care and Home Care along with increased pricing in Fabric Care. Home Care organic sales decreased low single digits as increased volume due to product innovation and increased customer support was more than offset by unfavorable geographic mix. Fabric Care organic sales increased low single digits due to increased organic volume and favorable product mix from premium forms in developed markets and increased pricing in developing markets. Baby, Feminine and Family Care segment organic sales increased one percent driven by volume growth in Family Care and favorable mix in Feminine Care. Baby Care organic sales decreased low single digits due mainly to competitive activity. Feminine Care organic sales increased mid-single digits from favorable product mix due to Always Discrete premium innovation. Family Care organic sales grew low single digits driven primarily by product innovation and increased marketing support. Diluted net earnings per share were $0.93, a decrease of four percent versus the prior year. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were also $0.93, which is an increase of 15% versus the base period. Current year results included non-core restructuring charges of $0.03 per share. Core earnings per share, which exclude non-core restructuring charges, were $0.96, an increase of 12% versus the prior year. Currency-neutral core earnings per share increased 15% for the quarter. Reported gross margin was unchanged, including a 40 basis point decrease in non-core restructuring charges versus the prior year. Core gross margin decreased 40 basis points, including 20 basis points of negative foreign exchange impacts. On a currency-neutral basis, core gross margin decreased 20 basis points as 210 basis points of productivity savings were more than offset by 100 basis points of unfavorable geographic and product mix, 80 basis points of commodity cost increases and 50 basis points of product reinvestments and other impacts. Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) as a percent of sales decreased 40 basis points on a reported basis versus the prior year, including a 10 basis point net benefit from a year-on-year decline in non-core charges. Core SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased 30 basis points versus the prior year. Savings of 50 basis points from overhead and marketing productivity and a 110 basis point benefit in other operating income were partially offset by a 130 basis point impact from investments in marketing, sales resources, and research and development. Reported operating profit margin increased 40 basis points. Core operating profit margin decreased 10 basis points versus the prior year, including 20 basis points of foreign exchange impacts. On a currency-neutral basis, core operating profit margin increased 10 basis points including productivity cost savings of 260 basis points for the quarter. Fiscal Year 2017 Guidance P&G said it is maintaining its guidance for organic sales growth in the range of two to three percent for fiscal 2017. Fiscal year to date, the Company is at the low end of this range. The Company expects the combined headwinds of foreign exchange and minor brand divestitures to reduce sales growth by two to three percentage points. As a result, P&G estimates all-in sales to be down one percent to in-line with the prior fiscal year. The Company also maintained its expectation for core earnings per share growth of mid-single digits versus fiscal 2016 Core EPS of $3.67. All-in GAAP earnings per share are expected to increase 48% to 50% versus fiscal year 2016 GAAP EPS of $3.69. The fiscal 2017 GAAP EPS estimate includes approximately $0.12 per share of non-core restructuring costs and $0.13 per share of charges related to early debt retirement that was executed in the second quarter. Also included in GAAP EPS is the $1.95 gain from the divestiture of 41 Beauty Brands to Coty in a transaction that was completed in the second quarter. P&G said it is increasing fiscal year guidance for adjusted free cash flow productivity from 90% or more to approximately 95%.

118,091 $ 127,136   The Procter & Gamble Company Exhibit 1: Non-GAAP Measures In accordance with the SEC's Regulation G, the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures used in Procter & Gamble's April 26, 2017 earnings release and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measure. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measure, but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. The Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items: Incremental restructuring: The Company has had and continues to have an ongoing level of restructuring activities. Such activities have resulted in ongoing annual restructuring related charges of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. Beginning in 2012 Procter & Gamble began a $10 billion strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that includes incremental restructuring activities. This results in incremental restructuring charges to accelerate productivity efforts and cost savings. The adjustment to Core earnings includes only the restructuring costs above what we believe are the normal recurring level of restructuring costs. Charges for certain European legal matters: Several countries in Europe issued separate complaints alleging that the Company, along with several other companies, engaged in violations of competition laws in prior periods. The Company established Legal Reserves related to these charges. Management does not view these charges as indicative of underlying business results. We do not view the above items to be part of our sustainable results and their exclusion from Core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation. Organic sales growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. Management believes this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. Core operating profit margin: Core operating profit margin is a measure of the Company's operating margin adjusted for items as indicated. Management believes this non-GAAP measure provides a supplemental perspective to the Company’s operating efficiency over time. Core gross margin: Core gross margin is a measure of the Company's gross margin adjusted for items as indicated. Management believes this non-GAAP measure provides a supplemental perspective to the Company’s operating efficiency over time. Core EPS and currency-neutral Core EPS: Core earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted as indicated. Currency-neutral Core EPS is a measure of the Company's Core EPS excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management views these non-GAAP measures as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. Adjusted free cash flow: Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding tax payments related to the Beauty Brands divestiture, which are non-recurring and not considered indicative of underlying cash flow performance. Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. Management views adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends and discretionary investment. Adjusted free cash flow productivity: Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings.

By WallaceWitkowski Reporter AnoraMahmudova Reporter U.S. stocks closed fractionally lower Wednesday, retreating from intraday highs after an outline of President Donald Trump’s tax plan was seen as light on detail. The S&P 500 index SPX, -0.05% which earlier had traded briefly above its previous closing high set March 1, finished down 1.16 points, or less than 0.1%, at 2,387.45. Seven out of the S&P 500’s 11 sectors finished lower ground with real-estate and consumer-staples stocks the largest decliners. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.10% fell 21.03 points, or 0.1%, at 20,975.09, following disappointing first-quarter earnings from Dow components, Procter & Gamble Co. PG, -2.51%  and Boeing Co. BA, -0.98% with both stocks leading decliners on the benchmark. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.00% finished down 0.27 points at 6,025.23, just short of its closing high, after touching an intraday all-time high of 6,040.89, a day after the tech-laden index surpassed the psychologically important level of 6,000 for the first time ever. On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn rolled out a one-page outline of Trump’s tax-reform plan in a news conference, promising more details later. See: Live blog and video of Trump tax plan rollout by Mnuchin and Cohn While offering a useful guide what the White House wants to do, the lack of more detail contributed to some subsequent weakness, said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex. Read: Full text of Trump administration tax principles The proposal, for example, calls for a one-time tax break on “trillions of dollars held overseas,” but doesn’t specify the rate. “The market was looking for more specific color on rates and the reduction of exemptions, but color on the repatriation tax, which is the single most important issue, was left unaddressed by that press conference,” Colas said in an interview. Investors had not been expecting anything other than a broad outline of the tax reform, but hoped for something with more clarity than previously vague descriptions like “massive” or “phenomenal”, said Quincy Krosby, market strategist, at Prudential Financial. Krosby noted that earnings, especially revenue growth has been underpinning the market as well as optimism about tax reform. Read: Trump’s tax reform could lift the stock-market to new heights Promises of a tax plan have been one of the linchpins of recent gains for risk assets and is likely to be a significant driver of trading action across asset classes as more details emerge. “There’s an existential problem with any kind of legislation as an investment catalyst,” Convergex’s Colas said. “Unlike earnings, this is not a specific event, this is a slow, grinding process that does not lend itself to being an investment catalyst.” Also in focus was a potential government shutdown this weekend. Some of those concerns, however, may have eased after Trump backed off on a demand for funding for a wall between the U.S.-Mexico border. See: Should Wall Street fear a government shutdown? Here’s how stocks fared in the past Earnings season: The season continues in full swing, with a deluge of results. Shares of PepsiCo Inc. PEP, -0.73% finished down 0.7% even as earnings beat analyst forecast. Anthem Inc. ANTM, +3.81%  shares rose 3.8% after results topped expectations. Twitter Inc. TWTR, +7.91%  closed up 7.9%, after the social media company beat first-quarter earnings expectations. Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. CMG, +2.38%  rose 2% after the casual restaurant chain reported first-quarter earnings ahead of forecasts late Tuesday. Edwards Lifesciences Corp. EW, +10.49%  shares rallied more than 10% after the medical-device maker topped Wall Street estimates for the quarter. Wyndham Worldwide Corp. WYN, +9.02% shares surged 9% following its first revenue beat since the fourth quarter of 2015. Seagate Technology PLC STX, -16.83%  shares dropped nearly 17% after the data storage company’s revenue for the quarter missed expectations. Arconic Inc. ARNC, +1.93%  shares rose 1.9% after the aerospace and car maker supplier’s earnings out late Tuesday topped Wall Street estimates.

Perfect store execution - Copyright Dassault Systèmes Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail April 26, 2017 04:53 AM Eastern Daylight Time VELIZY-VILLACOUBLAY, France--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News: Dassault Systèmes (Paris:DSY) (Euronext Paris: #13065, DSY.PA), the 3DEXPERIENCE Company, world leader in 3D design software, 3D Digital Mock Up and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solutions, today announced that the Procter & Gamble Company (P&G), one of the world’s largest consumer packaged goods companies, is using the 3DEXPERIENCE platform. P&G is deploying Dassault Systèmes’ “Perfect Product” and “Perfect Package” industry solution experiences to connect thousands of users to data, colleagues and consumers. This accelerates and improves the company’s packaging and product design, requirements management and program management. Consumer packaged goods is a fast-paced, competitive marketplace in which most purchase decisions are made in a matter of seconds. Companies must quickly deliver new materials, formulations and packaging that distinguish a product in the marketplace, contribute to a strong and reliable brand image, and inspire consumers to make – and repeat – a purchase. P&G, a longtime customer of Dassault Systèmes’ design, development and simulation applications, manages 10 product categories and 65 brands in more than 80 countries. The 3DEXPERIENCE platform helps P&G to leverage its scale with greater agility to innovate, efficiently manage and accelerate product programs in the context of short product lifecycles, fluctuating costs of raw materials, and highly variable consumer demand. “Our decision to upgrade our existing Dassault Systèmes’ PLM to the 3DEXPERIENCE platform is part of our work to digitally transform our business to support our work process digital transformation and drive value,” said Jean-Louis Hospitel, IT Director, P&G. “The 3DEXPERIENCE platform facilitates end-to-end innovation integration and improved user experience for our seamless technical community.” Based on the 3DEXPERIENCE platform, “Perfect Product” and “Perfect Package” are being extended across P&G to 18,000 users in research and development, product supply, quality and other disciplines to support the design and development of products. In a global collaborative digital environment, project data is traceable, shareable and reusable. Teams spend less time searching for data and have access to more consistent and accurate packaging and product specifications. This streamlines processes and saves rework and expense. In addition to this increased productivity, data can be exchanged easily with consumers to gain greater insight into trends, needs and usage. “The 3DEXPERIENCE platform and our industry solution experiences for consumer packaged goods connect people, processes and systems. As a result, companies can reduce product development time by up to 20 percent,” said Philippe Loeb, Vice President, Consumer Packaged Goods & Retail Industry, Dassault Systèmes. “This is a major advantage in an industry that requires bigger, better and faster innovation from companies that have to constantly readjust business priorities in response to changing consumer habits. Discovering and delivering the next breakthrough product becomes that much more efficient.” For more information on Dassault Systèmes’ industry solution experiences for consumer packaged goods and retail: http://www.3ds.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods-retail/ ### About Dassault Systèmes Dassault Systèmes, the 3DEXPERIENCE Company, provides business and people with virtual universes to imagine sustainable innovations.

While the "Mad Money" host is skeptical about the plan passing Congress, he looked at how a corporate tax cut from 36 percent down to 15 percent could change the stock market layout. "There are a lot of investors on the sidelines waiting for this market to come down to a more reasonable price," Cramer said. "What happens if so many companies are suddenly making more money because they have a lower tax rate? I bet it that would force billions and billions of dollars into the stock market in a virtuous circle of wealth creation." Still, for the moment, Cramer still recommends staying the course. And while investors should keep tax cuts in mind as a potential blessing on their portfolios, don't count on them too heavily. "Should you buy stocks in anticipation of this huge tax cut? The answer is point blank: no. The truth is we have no idea what will pass, and I seriously doubt this current plan can make it through Congress," the "Mad Money" host said. Susana Gonzalez | Bloomberg | Getty Images When PepsiCo, Boeing, Procter & Gamble and Texas Instruments all reported great earnings numbers but saw their stocks go down, Cramer decided to investigate. "The answer is that nothing's really wrong with any of these companies except their stocks simply got ahead of themselves. Investors got so excited that they bid them up to unsustainable levels," the "Mad Money" host said. In reality, the market's reaction was not an accurate reflection of the companies' successes, but a product of lofty expectations that came from each stock's massive run. "We can't ask, 'What's wrong?' We have to say, 'This is our chance.' And that's exactly what I think PepsiCo, Boeing, Procter & Gamble and Texas Instruments are worth buying right here," Cramer said. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images Then, Cramer spoke with Jim Fish, the president and CEO of Waste Management, a waste and recycling giant that saw its stock slide on earnings despite meeting expectations. Some of the market's nerves were wrought when the company reported timid guidance, which Fish attributed to a large drop in Waste Management's recycling business tied to Chinese buyers halting their purchases of recyclable newspaper material. "We're still feeling pretty optimistic about recycling right now, very optimistic," Fish told Cramer on Wednesday. "We just didn't want to raise guidance with something that doesn't have great visibility to it." And with corporate tax cuts now more concretely on the federal government's slate, Fish said he is looking forward to their benefits, saying the company would look into acquisitions as a first step. Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images Pipelines run toward oil storage tanks at the Enbridge Cushing storage terminal in Cushing, Oklahoma. Finally, with investors on the lookout for high-quality stocks that could be lifted by the president's policies, Cramer turned to one unusual energy play that could be one of the biggest winners. By acquiring Spectra Energy, Canadian pipeline giant Enbridge became the largest energy infrastructure company in North America. That positioned it to gain from U.S. projects, being that it operates the longest crude oil and gas liquids transportation system in the world. "Yep, the president may have run on an America First platform, and he's suddenly started to get very tough on trade with Canada, but that doesn't change the fact that right now, one of my favorite Trump stocks is a Canadian company," the "Mad Money" host said. In Cramer's lightning round, Cramer flew through his take on some caller favorite stocks: Sanofi: "I like that stock. I've got to tell you, [it's] got a good yield. Mostly what I really like is they've got that big position in Regeneron. They should merge and really kill it." Micron Technology: "This is very tough, because what happened is the price has spiked so much that people believe that they may have actually ruined the demand curve. And Seagate reported a number today that people didn't regard as being as strong as they'd like, so it's pulled down everybody. I think Micron is fine. It's just not in the explosive phase anymore because people keep thinking there's going to be one day [where] there's too many DRAMs, and then boom. But I don't think that day is here yet. I think we're OK. I'm no longer as confident as I've been saying because we've liked that from the teens." Questions for Cramer?

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed flat after also giving up earlier gains. "The discussion around the tax plan is a positive for the market," said John Conlon, chief investment officer at People's United Wealth Management. But "I don't think the market is excited; I think it takes some pressure off the market, but there are still questions about some of the details." Top White House officials outlined President Donald Trump's tax plan Wednesday, a proposal they said would be the "biggest tax cut" in U.S. history. The proposal slashes the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent. The White House added there will be a "one-time tax" on the trillions of dollars held by corporations overseas. However, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the rate for that tax has yet to be determined. Expectations for lower corporate taxes have been a boon for stocks ever since Trump was elected in November. Still, the Trump White House has failed to provide specifics on what these tax cuts might look like. It's time for the administration to "go big or go home and a 15% corporate tax rate will certainly make that happen," said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group, in a note to clients. "I'll leave it to others to figure out if and how we get there (will obviously be tough) but the implications will have to also be measured by any change in interest rates in response in gauging the impact on corporate earnings and for other obligations," he said. Trump outlined his tax reform vision ahead of a potential government shutdown. Government funding will end Friday unless Congress can agree on at least a temporary funding resolution. "I think some of the hesitancy in the market has to do with the potential government shutdown later this week," said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. "There's no historical precedent" for a market downturn during a government shutdown, he said. "But because the Trump presidency is different from any we've ever had, there's going to be some hesitancy." Meanwhile, earnings season carried on, with PepsiCo, United Technologies, Procter & Gamble and Twitter all posted a better-than-expected profit. Twitter's stock popped about 12 percent after reporting. This earnings season has shown thus far that Corporate America did very well last quarter. Of the 181 S&P 500 components that had reported as of Wednesday, 77 percent had topped earnings expectations while 67 percent beat on the top line, according to data from The Earnings Scout. "Remember though solid 1Q 2017 results only confirm what has already happened in the markets! 1Q 2017 results should not be used to infer what is going to happen," said Nick Raich, CEO of The Earnings Scout, in a note. "For that information, look to the direction of 2Q 2017 EPS estimate revisions." He said that second-quarter earnings growth expectations have fallen every week this earnings season since March 22. There were no major economic data reports released Wednesday, but Wall Street looked ahead to Friday's first-quarter GDP report. "What concerns me is the Fed is raising rates in a modest economy with earnings growing modestly," said Phil Blancato, CEO of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management. "The rate of change in the economy is changing. The consumer is healthy but not necessarily spending money."

Investors also questioned that the proposal was feasible. “The plan that has been announced today is very aggressive, and unlikely to pass as is,” Alan Gayle, a senior strategist at RidgeWorth Investments in Atlanta, told Bloomberg. “I haven’t heard of anyone on the street that has been adjusting earnings estimates based on the likelihood we’ll get tax reform. This remains an unknown and it’s not being factored into the market yet.” In 2.32pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.17 percent, as did the Nasdaq Composite Index. In 2.18pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.22 percent. Earlier in the day, the Nasdaq touched a record high 6,040.90 The Dow rose as gains in shares of Verizon and those of United Technologies, recently up 1.8 percent and 1.4 percent respectively, outweighed slides in shares of Procter & Gamble and those of Boeing, down 2 percent and 1.1. percent respectively. United Technologies posted quarterly results that surpassed expectations, while Procter & Gamble and Boeing each failed to meet the mark with their latest earnings. PepsiCo shares fell, trading 0.5 percent weaker as of 1.34pm in New York, amid concern about the company's margins even as it posted earnings that beat analysts' expectations. “We achieved solid revenue growth in the first quarter underpinned by global volume growth and positive net price realisation, despite challenging food and beverage industry trading conditions in North America and continued volatility in a number of developing and emerging markets,” PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi said in a statement. Even so, gross margin contracted 45 basis points in the first quarter, the company said. “The quality of the quarter was disappointing,” Andrea Teixeira, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co, said in a research note, Bloomberg reported. “Organic revenue, gross margin and operating margin all came in weaker than we anticipated.” Meanwhile, Canadian and Mexican stocks slid after Politico reported that the Trump administration is considering an executive order on withdrawing the US from NAFTA. The Canadian dollar and Mexican peso also declined. A draft order has been submitted for the final stages of review and could be unveiled late this week or early next week, Politico reported, citing two White House officials. The effort, which still could change in the coming days as more officials weigh in, would indicate the administration’s intent to withdraw from the sweeping pact by triggering the timeline set forth in the deal, according to Politico. "It is a clear indication that they [in the White House] are wanting changes but we will have to see what emerges," Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada, told Reuters. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a 0.5 percent increase from the previous close. Germany’s DAX Index advanced 0.1 percent, while the UK’s FTSE 100 Index rose 0.2 percent, as did France’s CAC40 Index.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 27 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman While you were sleeping: Concern about Trump’s tax plans Thursday, 27 April 2017, 10:22 am Article: BusinessDesk Thursday 27 April 2017 07:06 AM While you were sleeping: Concern about Trump’s tax plans By Margreet Dietz April 27 (BusinessDesk) – Wall Street gave up some of its earlier gains after the US administration’s unveiling of tax cut plans fell short on details. Investors also questioned that the proposal was feasible. “The plan that has been announced today is very aggressive, and unlikely to pass as is,” Alan Gayle, a senior strategist at RidgeWorth Investments in Atlanta, told Bloomberg. “I haven’t heard of anyone on the street that has been adjusting earnings estimates based on the likelihood we’ll get tax reform. This remains an unknown and it’s not being factored into the market yet.” In 2.32pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.17 percent, as did the Nasdaq Composite Index. In 2.18pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.22 percent. Earlier in the day, the Nasdaq touched a record high 6,040.90 The Dow rose as gains in shares of Verizon and those of United Technologies, recently up 1.8 percent and 1.4 percent respectively, outweighed slides in shares of Procter & Gamble and those of Boeing, down 2 percent and 1.1. percent respectively. United Technologies posted quarterly results that surpassed expectations, while Procter & Gamble and Boeing each failed to meet the mark with their latest earnings. PepsiCo shares fell, trading 0.5 percent weaker as of 1.34pm in New York, amid concern about the company’s margins even as it posted earnings that beat analysts’ expectations. “We achieved solid revenue growth in the first quarter underpinned by global volume growth and positive net price realisation, despite challenging food and beverage industry trading conditions in North America and continued volatility in a number of developing and emerging markets,” PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi said in a statement. Even so, gross margin contracted 45 basis points in the first quarter, the company said. “The quality of the quarter was disappointing,” Andrea Teixeira, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co, said in a research note, Bloomberg reported. “Organic revenue, gross margin and operating margin all came in weaker than we anticipated.” Meanwhile, Canadian and Mexican stocks slid after Politico reported that the Trump administration is considering an executive order on withdrawing the US from NAFTA. The Canadian dollar and Mexican peso also declined. A draft order has been submitted for the final stages of review and could be unveiled late this week or early next week, Politico reported, citing two White House officials. The effort, which still could change in the coming days as more officials weigh in, would indicate the administration’s intent to withdraw from the sweeping pact by triggering the timeline set forth in the deal, according to Politico. „It is a clear indication that they [in the White House] are wanting changes but we will have to see what emerges,” Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada, told Reuters. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a 0.5 percent increase from the previous close. Germany’s DAX Index advanced 0.1 percent, while the UK’s FTSE 100 Index rose 0.2 percent, as did France’s CAC40 Index.

"The answer is that nothing's really wrong with any of these companies except their stocks simply got ahead of themselves. Investors got so excited that they bid them up to unsustainable levels," the "Mad Money" host said. In reality, the market's reaction was not an accurate reflection of the companies' successes, but a product of lofty expectations that came from each stock's massive run. Watch the full segment here: show chapters Cramer: Why these 4 stocks went down after spectacular earnings reports    8 Hours Ago | 05:02 Take PepsiCo. "It delivered you exactly what we've come to expect from [CEO] Indra Nooyi's PepsiCo, a dependable set of numbers with great execution and a lot more organic growth that Coca-Cola," Cramer said. So why did its stock go down when it reported? Because PepsiCo's shares ran up from $103 in February to $114 heading into the quarter, one of the best moves in the packaged goods space. "PEP just isn't going to be rewarded for doing its usual great stuff after that kind of advance," Cramer said. "So you get this kind of pullback, the kind of pullback that lasts for a couple of days and then you buy." Aerospace giant Boeing saw a similar effect on its stock after surprising the market with strong cash flows and order numbers as well as belated gains from its newest airplane, the Dreamliner. Cramer argued that the stock had already seen a massive run from $142 to $184 after the U.S. election, partly due to President Donald Trump's victory and partly because of better-than-expected earnings. "Even though the numbers were terrific, though, it wasn't terrific enough. I don't know if anything could have been enough to move the stock higher after that move," he said. Procter & Gamble's earnings were not particularly stunning to Cramer, though the household goods and personal products maker still beat estimates. The company's organic growth has been lagging at 1 percent, but when Nelson Peltz's activist fund Trian Partners took a $3.5 billion position in the stock in February, it soared above $90 and has hovered near that high since. "You need to understand that while the quarter wasn't anything fabulous, Nelson Peltz is pretty much the only large, engaged investor where it's paid to buy the stock he likes after he's announced a position," Cramer said. "This is your chance to piggy back on his yet unannounced plan for what he wants to do with Procter. I think it's a gift to get it down here at $87." Finally, Texas Instruments' stellar quarter seemed to have left the market wanting more after the semiconductor play's tear from $67 just before the election to $82 ahead of its report. "It had to do far more than magnificently if it was going to do what the stocks of Caterpillar or McDonald's or DuPont did, report some number that seemed insanely better, almost alchemy," Cramer said. "It didn't. It's consistent. Consistency means no surprises [and] solid numbers." At the end of the day, all investors want to own the stocks of companies that continue to outperform and occasionally shock the market with incredible results. "But we also need reliable, consistent performers that allow us to sleep at night, and if possible, we want to buy those at a discount," Cramer said. "We can't ask, 'What's wrong?' We have to say, 'This is our chance.' And that's exactly what I think PepsiCo, Boeing, Procter & Gamble and Texas Instruments are worth buying right here." Questions for Cramer?

While you were sleeping: UPDATED Trump's tax plans fail to lift stocks Margreet Dietz Thursday April 27, 2017 Share Pepsico chief executive Indra Nooyi says there were challenging trading conditions in North America. Play NBR radio on Wall Street gave up some of its earlier gains after the US administration's unveiling of tax cut plans fell short on details. Investors also questioned that the proposal was feasible. "The plan that has been announced today is very aggressive, and unlikely to pass as is," Alan Gayle, a senior strategist at RidgeWorth Investments in Atlanta, told Bloomberg. "I haven't heard of anyone on the street that has been adjusting earnings estimates based on the likelihood we'll get tax reform. This remains an unknown and it's not being factored into the market yet." At the close of trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 21.03 points, or 0.1%, to 20,975.09. The Nasdaq Composite Index was unchanged at 6025.23 and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 0.05% to 2387.45. Earlier in the day, the Nasdaq touched a record high 6040.90 before falling back later in the session.  In the Dow, rises in Verizon and United Technologies failed to outweigh slides in Procter & Gamble and Boeing. PepsiCo margins tighten United Technologies posted quarterly results that surpassed expectations, while Procter & Gamble and Boeing each failed to meet the mark with their latest earnings. PepsiCo shares fell amid concern about the company's margins even as it posted earnings that beat analysts' expectations. "We achieved solid revenue growth in the first quarter underpinned by global volume growth and positive net price realisation, despite challenging food and beverage industry trading conditions in North America and continued volatility in a number of developing and emerging markets," PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi said in a statement. Even so, gross margin contracted 45 basis points in the first quarter, the company said. "The quality of the quarter was disappointing," Andrea Teixeira, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co, said in a research note, Bloomberg reported. "Organic revenue, gross margin and operating margin all came in weaker than we anticipated."

Richa Naidu P&G has said it plans to save as much as $10 billion in costs over the next five years. Photo: Bloomberg Bengaluru: Procter & Gamble Co., maker of Tide detergent and Gillette razors, reported an 8.3% fall in third-quarter profit—hurt by a strong dollar and slowing economic growth that dampened consumer spending in several countries. Economic and political uncertainties—from higher gas prices in the US and higher utility prices in Saudi Arabia to demonetization in India—triggered a sharp brake in consumer spending during the quarter, the company said on a post-earnings conference call. Making matters worse, the US dollar rose about 3.6% in the March quarter, on an average, compared with a quarter earlier, spurred by investors betting on the so-called “Trump trade”. A strong dollar makes US goods less competitive abroad, and foreign earnings less valuable when converted into dollars. P&G, which sells its brands in more than 180 countries, gets nearly half its revenue from Europe, China, Asia and the Middle East. “We continue to deal with an unprecedented amount of geopolitical disruption and uncertainty, which is affecting market growth, currencies and commodities,” chief financial officer Joe Moeller said on the call. “We’re aggressively driving cost savings to mitigate these impacts.” P&G has said it plans to save as much as $10 billion in costs over the next five years, and use a chunk of those savings to improve packaging, research and development, and sales coverage. ALSO READ: JHS Svendgaard Labs settles disputes with Procter & Gamble India The consumer goods giant, whose iconic brands include Pampers, Head-and-Shoulders and Vicks, maintained expectations of a mid-single digit rise in full-year adjusted earnings per share growth, and a 2-3% increase in organic sales growth. Net income attributable to the Cincinnati, Ohio-based company declined to $2.52 billion, or 93 cents per share, in the three months ended 31 March. Adjusted earnings came in at 96 cents per share, beating Wall Street estimates by 2 cents. Organic sales in P&G’s two largest businesses—fabric and home care, and baby, feminine and family care—rose 1%. Organic sales at its grooming business fell 6%. Net sales fell about 1% to $15.61 billion—the thirteenth straight quarter of decline. Analysts had been looking for $15.73 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. P&G, which traces its roots to a family-run candle and soap business in 1837, has been selling off unprofitable brands and focusing on core brands such as Tide and Pampers to revive sluggish sales. It sold 41 of its brands, including Clairol and Wella, to Coty Inc. in a $12.5 billion deal in October.

The world's largest consumer products maker reported fiscal third-quarter net income of $2.52 billion and per-share profit of 93 cents. Earnings, adjusted for non-recurring costs, were 96 cents per share, beating the average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research, who expected earnings of 94 cents per share. P&G posted profit of $2.75 billion in the same quarter last year. But the Cincinnati-based company posted revenue of $15.61 billion in the period, falling short of Street forecasts. Nine analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $15.71 billion. The company had revenue of $15.76 billion for the same quarter last year. Organic sales — a closely watched figure strips out the effects of foreign currency swings, acquisitions and divestitures — were up 1 percent with increases in four out of the company's five business segments. P&G maintained its guidance for organic sales growth between 2 and 3 percent for fiscal 2017, despite continued foreign currency headwinds and minor brand divestitures.

P&G reported a $2.5 billion third-quarter profit, a 8% decrease from the same period a year ago but in line with analysts' estimates. Sales, however, fell 1% to $15.6 billion, well short of Wall Street forecasts. P&G reported earnings per diluted share of 93 cents and core earnings at 96 cents. Wall Street expected the company to report core earnings of 94 cents. CEO David Taylor said in a statement the company's growth was slowed by an uncertain economy and political discourse here and abroad. Sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures developed markets in the United States and Western Europe, were flat, while developing markets, from Russia to Brazil, grew at a modest 3%. P&G's rebound in China stalled as sales dipped 1%. Moeller said the company expects new diaper innovations to be introduced in August will further help sales there. P&G's razor business suffered a particularly lackluster quarter with organic sales -- which exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates, acquisitions or divestitures -- dropping 6%. The results are the first since P&G announced in February it would cut razor prices to shore up market share. Price cuts trimmed 2% from the company's grooming business, which sells Gillette razors, but 4% of sagging sales reflected customers trading down to cheaper products. In a conference call, chief financial officer Jon Moeller said P&G had warned investors at a February investor conference that the quarter "would be the weakest of the fiscal year." Looking ahead, the company maintained its sales guidance for organic sales to climb 2% to 3%, while total sales after foreign exchange and other factors would be flat or down 1%. Moeller said the results don't reflect the latest announced price cuts that took effect in early April. "We're confident that will put us in a better place," Moeller said. P&G's stock closed Wednesday at $87.74, down about 2.5% or $2.26 a share. Wall Street analysts said the third quarter was a letdown compared with stronger results in the second quarter where P&G boosted its sales outlook for the fiscal year. Analysts were also displeased with its gross and operating profit margins. "Overall, we believe the result is modestly disappointing relative to expectations," wrote Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan, in a note to investors. Barclays analyst Lauren Lieberman called the results "a clear disappointment" but wondered aloud in a note to investors if a stock selloff might be muted given February reports that activist hedge fund Trian Fund Management had acquired a $3.5 billion stake in the company. "Our view has been that the activist fund may well be happy to catch a natural inflection point in P&G’s business performance given easing (foreign exchange) pressures & resultantly clearer delivery of cost savings," Lieberman wrote. "Given the very weak operating environment in the U.S. this quarter and P&G’s explicit commitment to reinvestment spending this year, we think it would be jumping the gun to suggest a one quarter set back will trigger a change in that perspective." 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2pm7DVW

Published on April 26, 2017. Credit: Courtesy Procter & Gamble/Business Wire Most Popular Procter & Gamble Co. wants to cut a whopping $2 billion in marketing spending over five years, and for the first time is providing details on a broader $10 billion cost-cutting plan launched a year ago. That marketing spending cut comes amid a fiscal third-quarter earnings report where the company missed on sales-growth expectations and lost market-share in developing markets despite hiking ad spending. While the cost cuts were the biggest takeaway, P&G also outlined how it plans to become "irresistibly superior" in the eyes of consumers. First, those massive cuts: They include $1 billion or more in media and around $500 million in agency fees, which comes on top of $600 million of cuts in prior years that reduced P&G's spending there to around $1.4 billion annually. A spokeswoman said this doesn't necessarily mean P&G's spending on creative costs will fall under $1 billion a year, given growth that may otherwise occur. Jon Moeller Credit: Procter & Gamble Co. P&G also outlined $12 billion to $13 billion in overall savings that are "risk adjusted" down to $10 billion in case some aren't realized. And some savings in other areas – including $7 billion in material, packaging, production and transportations costs -- will likely be reinvested in marketing. So there are many moving parts. "We see over $2 billion in savings opportunities in marketing spending, with half or more coming from media rates or eliminating supply-chain waste," said P&G Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller on the company's earnings call Wednesday. "We're targeting up to half a billion more from reducing agency fees and ad-production costs. And we see about half a billion in sales from in-store materials, direct-to-consumer programs, and improved efficiencies in trial and sampling programs." As with agency fees, the company isn't projecting exactly what media spending will be five years out – just that it can squeeze $1 billion or more out of the system. That will come at least partly through the tougher stand Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard outlined in January on reforming the digital media supply chain. The cuts come with P&G in the midst of a comprehensive review of agency contracts and compensation, including reducing duplication of staffing and services on the client and agency sides. Despite those longer-term cuts, P&G hiked reported advertising spending last quarter – which includes media and outside agency fees -- to $1.8 billion from $1.7 billion a year ago, Moeller said on a call with media this morning. All-in marketing spending, which includes some costs of in-store activities and consumer promotion, held steady at $2.6 billion, he said. So that $2 billion in savings comes out of a pot likely of around $10 billion for the fiscal year ended June 30. Second, activist investor Nelson Peltz, as expected wasn't mentioned, yet still loomed large. Adding missing details from P&G's cost-cutting strategy may helped blunt whatever Peltz will describe in an anticipated white paper. Related Stories 4 Things to Expect From Procter & Gamble's Earnings Report P&G's Pritchard Blasts Objections to His Digital Demands as 'Head Fakes' P&G Tells Digital to Clean Up, Lays Down New Rules for Agencies and Ad Tech to Get Paid But P&G didn't help its case by missing on the revenue line, with organic sales growth up 1% vs. the 1.8% expected by analysts. Moeller outlined a litany of issues holding down market growth – including late tax refunds in the U.S., retailers paring inventories and competitive promotion in advance of the 12% cut in razor and blade prices that took effect this month. P&G's grooming business, including razors, was largely responsible for the miss, with sales down 6% organically. But there may be less to this miss than meets the eye. The price cut was announced in February but didn't take effect until April, likely leading some retailers to cut razor orders last quarter to take delivery instead this quarter. That could actually spring-load P&G's sales numbers for this all-important business in the fiscal fourth quarter during the key Father's Day period for razors. Third, P&G has what sounds like a new brand name for P&G branding: Irresistible Superiority. It begs for P&G-style acroynym IS. And Moeller gave considerable detail on what the meaning of IS is. "This is what will be required in a slow-growth environment in order to grow markets and market share," he said. "When a consumer has an Irresistibly Superior experience with our products and packages, it raises their expectations for performance in the category. It makes it hard for them to go back to what they were using before." Marc Pritchard Here's how it's measured: Instead of tracking "weighted purchase intent" scores in surveys, P&G is now weighing a "a body of evidence" that "integrates technical tests, blind tests, [tracking call and online contacts], household panel tests, and in-market product reviews," Moeller said. "It adds behavioral data, which is more reliable than attitudinal data, which is what we've historically used." IS similarly changes how P&G evaluates ads. Irresistibly Superior advertising "makes you think, talk, laugh, cry and smile, act and of course buy," Moeller said, "and is a voice for good by expressing views on points that matter, and where the brand matters." He described it as "advertising that clears the bar for creative brilliance, sparking conversations, affecting attitudes, changing behavior and sometimes even defining popular culture." Measuring this will go way beyond conventional copy testing to a similar "body of evidence." Ads deemed "effective" must raise awareness, increase household penetration and share growth for at least one year and be judged so by a "panel of experts," which Pritchard last month said include P&G executives not affiliated with the brands being evaluated. Always, Tide, Dawn and SK-II are brands currently with ads deemed effective, Moeller said. Only 30% of P&G efforts currently are deemed Irresistibly Superior, so there's work to do. Fourth, planned cost cuts or no, that requires increased investments in product formulations, packaging, advertising, sales support, sampling, R&D and pricing, Moeller said. Those investments will come from in part from cost savings.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 10:35 PM, April 26, 2017 Procter & Gamble Co <PG.N>, maker of Tide detergent and Gillette razors, reported an 8.3 percent fall in third-quarter profit hurt by a strong dollar and slowing economic growth that dampened consumer spending in several countries. Economic and political uncertainties - from higher gas prices in the United States and higher utility prices in Saudi Arabia to demonetization in India - triggered a sharp brake in consumer spending during the quarter, the company said on a post-earnings conference call. Making matters worse, the U.S. dollar <.DXY> rose about 3.6 percent in the March quarter, on an average, compared with a quarter earlier, spurred by investors betting on the so-called "Trump trade". A strong dollar makes U.S. goods less competitive abroad, and foreign earnings less valuable when converted into dollars. P&G, which sells its brands in more than 180 countries, gets nearly half its revenue from Europe, China, Asia and the Middle East. "We continue to deal with an unprecedented amount of geopolitical disruption and uncertainty, which is affecting market growth, currencies and commodities," Chief Financial Officer Joe Moeller said on the call. "We're aggressively driving cost savings to mitigate these impacts." P&G has said it plans to save as much as $10 billion in costs over the next five years, and use a chunk of those savings to improve packaging, research and development, and sales coverage. The company's stock, which has jumped 10.6 percent in the past year, fell as much as 2 percent in morning trading on Wednesday. The S&P 500 index has risen 6.6 percent in the same period. SALES FALL AGAIN The consumer goods giant, whose iconic brands include Pampers, Head-and-Shoulders and Vicks, maintained expectations of a mid-single digit rise in full-year adjusted earnings per share growth, and a 2-3 percent increase in organic sales growth. Net income attributable to the Cincinnati, Ohio-based company declined to $2.52 billion, or 93 cents per share, in the three months ended March 31. Adjusted earnings came in at 96 cents per share, beating Wall Street estimates by 2 cents. Organic sales in P&G's two largest businesses - fabric and home care, and baby, feminine and family care - rose 1 percent. Organic sales at its grooming business fell 6 percent. Net sales fell about 1 percent to $15.61 billion - the thirteenth straight quarter of declines. Analysts had been looking for $15.73 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. P&G, which traces its roots to a family-run candle and soap business in 1837, has been selling off unprofitable brands and focusing on core brands such as Tide and Pampers to revive sluggish sales. It sold 41 of its brands, including Clairol and Wella, to Coty Inc <COTY.N> in a $12.5 billion deal in October.

Der Nettogewinn sank im Ende März abgeschlossenen Geschäftsquartal um 8 Prozent auf 2,5 Milliarden US-Dollar, wie das Unternehmen am Mittwoch mitteilte. Bereinigt um Sonderfaktoren erhöhte ProcterGamble sein Ergebnis je Aktie um 12 Prozent auf 0,96 Dollar und übertraf damit die Erwartungen der Analysten. Insgesamt war das Umfeld von einem sich abschwächenden Marktwachstum, anhaltenden geopolitischen Spannungen sowie negativen Währungseffekten gekennzeichnet, wie Vorstandschef David Taylor erklärte. Dem Hersteller von Marken wie Pampers, Gillette oder Ariel, der seine Produkte weltweit verkauft, macht dabei der starke Dollar bereits seit längerem zu schaffen. Beim Umsatz konnte P&G keine großen Sprünge machen. Die Erlöse sanken leicht um 1 Prozent auf 15,6 Milliarden Dollar, was unter den Prognosen des Marktes lag. Organisch - sprich bereinigt um Wechselkurseffekte sowie Zu- oder Verkäufe - erzielte P&G ein kleines Plus von 1 Prozent. Der Konzern befindet sich gerade im Umbau und will sich verstärkt auf Reinigungs- und Pflegemittel konzentrieren. Eine ganze Reihe von Marken hat P&G bereits verkauft, unter anderem die Haarpflegemarke Wella. Die Jahresprognose bekräftigte P&G. Das Unternehmen geht weiter von einem organischen Umsatzplus von 2 bis 3 Prozent aus. Nach neun Monaten bewegt sich Procter & Gamble am unteren Ende der Spanne. Nominal rechnet das Management wegen negativer Währungseffekte sowie Verkäufen mit einem Rückgang von 1 Prozent. Das Ergebnis je Aktie sollte dank Gewinnen aus Unternehmensverkäufen um bis zu 50 Prozent zulegen. Bereinigt wird ein Plus im mittleren einstelligen Prozentbereich erwartet, nach 3,67 Dollar im Vorjahr./nas/tos/stb CINCINNATI (dpa-AFX) Bildquellen: Gil C / Shutterstock.com FACEBOOK Kommentare lesen Nachrichten zu Procter & Gamble Co.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 26 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman McCann Worldgroup Sweeps The 53rd International ANDY Awards with 23 Awards and Best in Show GRANDY for „The Field Trip To Mars” NEW YORK, NY–(Marketwired – April 25, 2017) – The ADVERTISING Club of New York’s 2017 International ANDY Awards, the first advertising creative award show of the season, has announced this year’s winners. McCann Worldgroup swept this year’s show, being named Agency Network of the Year with a total of 23 awards, and McCann New York being named Agency of the Year with nine ANDYs and the Best in Show GRANDY Award for „The Field Trip to Mars.” Leo Burnett was the show’s second largest winner with 18 awards. adam&eveDDB ranked in third place with eight ANDY awards. The Bravery Award, which is annually awarded to a marketer for supporting innovative and courageous work, has been awarded to P&G India for „Dads #ShareTheLoad” campaign. The Richard T. O’Reilly Award for Outstanding Public Service has been awarded to DAVID Buenos Aires for its „MANBOOBS4BOOBS” campaign for MACMA. /EINPresswire.com/ — This year’s jury was led by North American Chief Creative Officer of Deutsch, Pete Favat, and made up of 24 of the global advertising community’s most respected creative directors from advertising organizations including: Anomaly, Shanghai; Lola MullenLowe, Madrid; Jung von Matt, Hamburg; AlmapBBDO, Sao Paulo; and J. Walter Thompson, India. In addition, representatives from pre and post production agencies like PRETTYBIRD and Framestore, as well as brands like Burger King were represented on the jury. The GRANDY winner „The Field Trip to Mars” was a first-of-its-kind „group VR” experience created by McCann New York for client Lockheed Martin in which the windows of a seemingly ordinary school bus transformed to take riders on a tour of the Martian surface. Cutting-edge technology created a „1:1 relationship” between Earth and Mars. The recipient of this honor is awarded a $50,000 cash prize. View entire list of winners here: https://www.andyawards.com/winners/ On this year’s winners, Favat stated, „Our jury set out to award the bravest ideas, which we, as an industry, strive to produce. We are in alignment with Cannes Lions alongside Badger and Winters’ Chief Creative Officer Madonna Badger on the need to ban work that reflects gender bias as well as the #womennotobjects initiative. We feel confident that this year’s winners respectfully portray both men and women.” Gina Grillo, President and CEO of The ADVERTISING Club of New York, and The International ANDY Awards, added, „As the first show of the 2017 award show season, and one with a slightly accelerated eligibility timeline, the ANDYs prides itself on its ability to predict award season favorites. This year, we have identified 10 frontrunners to watch that have not yet been eligible for other major award shows and which, we believe, have a high likelihood of becoming serial award show winners over the coming season.” Select predicted winners include: My Mutant Brain, MJZ IKEA: Cook This Page, Leo Burnett, Toronto Midnight, TBWA Media Arts Lab The Line Up song, FP7/CAI Come Together, adam&eveDDB The Box That Keeps Giving, McCann New York Time Is Precious, Wieden+Kennedy Portland GRAVITY CAT, Hakuhodo Inc. / TOHOKUSHINSHA FILM CORPORATION Burger King Burning Stores, DAVID The Agency The World’s Biggest Asshole, The Martin Agency The Bravery Award goes to P&G India for „Dads #ShareTheLoad.” This social movement was led by a poignant film about a dad’s self-realization and conversion about roles and responsibilities within the home, and about setting the right examples by helping with laundry. Glenn C. Smith Award goes to Brazilian students for „Sh**ty Candidates. This campaign encouraged residents to collect their dog poop (a city-wide problem) and align it with the sh**tiest political candidates. This award includes a $10,000 scholarship. The Richard T. O’Reilly award recognizes a public service campaign, which urges women to check their breasts to help prevent breast cancer. As female breasts are typically censored on social media due to nudity policies, „MANBOOBS4BOOBS” creatively solved the problem. This award comes with a $10,000 donation to the non-profit organization. In an industry first, The International ANDY Awards, with the help of Corporate Partner Amazon Media Group, is setting out to announce winners and deliver awards globally. In conjunction with this press announcement of the 2017 ANDY Winners, winners will learn if they won gold, silver or bronze ANDYs by delivery in a custom branded Amazon brown box, complete with the ubiquitous smile as well as the ANDYs’ logo. The ANDYs global community will feel united in this shared moment of celebration round the ideas that made it not only through the advertising gauntlet, but the show’s tough judging process.

News sign-up Measurement concerns fail to slow online ad spending News, 27 April 2017 Topics Advertising expenditure & forecasts Digital media planning & buying TORONTO: Two thirds of big brands will increase online adspend in 2017-18 despite growing concerns around performance metrics and viewability, a new report finds. A study undertaken by the World Federation of Advertisers and Ebiquity into the intentions and concerns of the world's largest advertisers, based on responses from more than 50 leading global advertisers, showed that brands are exercising increased caution when buying online advertising. The results indicated that advertisers are not convinced by current measurement standards in online advertising: 62% of respondents expressed dissatisfaction; and less than half (45%) could point to the value it adds. In addition, 72% of respondents believed that advertisers had over-invested in online advertising. This is in part due to concerns over viewability, which 90% of respondents labelled a 'major concern'. "Respondents demonstrate strong support for recent public calls by Marc Pritchard of Procter & Gamble and others for higher standards in independent measurement and verification in online advertising," said Nick Manning, Chief Strategy Officer for Ebiquity. Despite their concerns, two thirds of advertisers said they planned to increase online spend in the coming year; one fifth (21%) said they would reduce their paid online activity. The WFA noted that while advertisers were not yet convinced about the effectiveness of digital advertising, 75% were willing to accept the challenges it presents. There are significant motivations for advertising online, the foremost being to drive incremental reach – a major part of the decision to invest for 79% of marketers – followed by increasing brand awareness, cited by 69%. Just 55% cited 'precise targeting' as a major factor. Due to the perception that online video advertising contributes to a 'high effect', this channel will be the main beneficiary of increasing spend, with 89% of respondents indicating they will invest more this year. Advertisers are looking for proof, Manning added, and "a better understanding of how online contributes to their business performance and how it delivers meaningful return on investment".

Investors also questioned that the proposal was feasible. “The plan that has been announced today is very aggressive, and unlikely to pass as is,” Alan Gayle, a senior strategist at RidgeWorth Investments in Atlanta, told Bloomberg. “I haven’t heard of anyone on the street that has been adjusting earnings estimates based on the likelihood we’ll get tax reform. This remains an unknown and it’s not being factored into the market yet.” In 2.32pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.17 percent, as did the Nasdaq Composite Index. In 2.18pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.22 percent. Earlier in the day, the Nasdaq touched a record high 6,040.90 The Dow rose as gains in shares of Verizon and those of United Technologies, recently up 1.8 percent and 1.4 percent respectively, outweighed slides in shares of Procter & Gamble and those of Boeing, down 2 percent and 1.1. percent respectively. United Technologies posted quarterly results that surpassed expectations, while Procter & Gamble and Boeing each failed to meet the mark with their latest earnings. PepsiCo shares fell, trading 0.5 percent weaker as of 1.34pm in New York, amid concern about the company’s margins even as it posted earnings that beat analysts’ expectations. “We achieved solid revenue growth in the first quarter underpinned by global volume growth and positive net price realisation, despite challenging food and beverage industry trading conditions in North America and continued volatility in a number of developing and emerging markets,” PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi said in a statement. Even so, gross margin contracted 45 basis points in the first quarter, the company said. “The quality of the quarter was disappointing,” Andrea Teixeira, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co, said in a research note, Bloomberg reported. “Organic revenue, gross margin and operating margin all came in weaker than we anticipated.” Meanwhile, Canadian and Mexican stocks slid after Politico reported that the Trump administration is considering an executive order on withdrawing the US from NAFTA. The Canadian dollar and Mexican peso also declined. A draft order has been submitted for the final stages of review and could be unveiled late this week or early next week, Politico reported, citing two White House officials. The effort, which still could change in the coming days as more officials weigh in, would indicate the administration’s intent to withdraw from the sweeping pact by triggering the timeline set forth in the deal, according to Politico. “It is a clear indication that they [in the White House] are wanting changes but we will have to see what emerges,” Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada, told Reuters. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a 0.5 percent increase from the previous close. Germany’s DAX Index advanced 0.1 percent, while the UK’s FTSE 100 Index rose 0.2 percent, as did France’s CAC40 Index.

Advertisement “I love it so much,” he told ESPN last August. “I think that’s one of my greatest traits. It has really allowed me to grow my platform and build my brand.” Butt has made a name for himself as a football player for being a two-time Big Ten tight end of the year. He’s one of the top players at his position available for the NFL draft, which starts Thursday. On Tuesday, Charmin tweeted , “Have you seen the #CharminDumpTruck driving through? We’ve got a special destination for a butt-load of TP” On Wednesday, a Columbus radio station, 97.1 The Fan, tweeted a picture of the load of toilet paper being dropped on a lawn with Butt standing nearby. ___ More AP college football: www.collegefootball.ap.org Read all of our coverage on the potential government shutdown.

[ 51 ] April 26, 2017 | Erik Loomis Corporations love government interference when it means they can avoid states holding them accountable. During the 2016 presidential campaign, both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton pledged their support for more paid family leave. Now big business is countering the calls with a proposal of its own: Congress should establish a certain optional amount of paid leave and, if companies meet that threshold, they should be protected from state or local laws that might require more. The proposal is part of a report being released Tuesday by the HR Policy Association, a coalition of more than 380 major U.S. companies. Together, the group’s members employ 9 percent of America’s private-sector workers. Executives on the committee behind the report represent companies including Marriott International, Procter & Gamble, IBM, Cigna, General Electric, Wendy’s, Oracle and General Mills. The preemptive strike from the business community is also a response to the increasing number of states and municipalities that have taken matters into their own hands, passing local laws that require employers to offer paid time off. You can see why they are freaking out. Those states and cities are so onerous and mean to our betters! As of now, federal law offers many employees the opportunity to take unpaid family leave, but doesn’t require employers to give workers paid time off for sickness or childcare, including maternity leave. Since 2011, seven states and dozens of cities have passed laws requiring companies to provide paid sick days. Another two states and the District of Columbia passed laws creating family leave funds and requiring companies to let their employees use them. In places like California, Arizona, New York City and Minneapolis, new laws let employees accrue at least one hour of sick time for every 30 hours of work, or roughly one sick day for every six weeks of full-time work. Nationally about 61 percent of private-sector workers have access to some form of paid sick days, according to 2015 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Twelve percent have some form of paid family leave. One sick day every six weeks! What’s next, the slaughtered first born of every CEO? No wonder corporations need special government interference. The free market indeed.

Log in to Reply PunditusMaximus says: April 26, 2017 at 9:26 pm None of us have any idea why HRC chose to run after she had already pulled together so many resources that it was an open question whether she could do more good as President or the Clinton Foundation (and her own private wealth’s) manager.

Unless you’re a corporation, in which case you can just have at it whether the people you’re fucking consent to it or not.

Log in to Reply phalamir says: April 26, 2017 at 7:57 pm The South always demanded that the North had to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act, even if they had outlawed slavery, and Taney stripped even the ability to prevent slavery from the North. The South has always been explicit about the fact that there are real people, i.e. the slave-owning plantation elite, and farm machinery. If there are no slave-owners in a state, it cannot have rights, because combine harvesters are not capable of having rights. New York is simply a large John Deere storage yard, not a state. Always has been, always will be, and if you mouth off at Massa, you must be punished.

The answer is: Yes, 30 different approaches. Maybe even 50, one for each state. By nature of our Constitution every state has a certain degree of sovereignty. Doing everything 50 different ways is baked in already. If there is a state-level sick leave mandate then dealing with that is no different from dealing with every other state-level labor law. Log in to Reply sigaba says: April 26, 2017 at 8:13 pm The suspected rationale is that a corporation, being not just a Person, but Person that simultaneously “lives” in every state in which they do business, cannot be practically constrained by the dictates of mere federalism, because federalism only applies to beings that can only live in one state at a time. The long-term goal is nationalization of governance and obliteration of practical federalism with quasi-state institutions like ALEC, the Republican party, and large corporations holding de facto control over policy by writing laws and holding effective veto, while the elected de jure governments in the states and in DC are really just rubber stamps or functionaries.

Log in to Reply Breadbaker says: April 26, 2017 at 9:03 pm Each such corporation does business in each state at the sufferance of the foreign corporation laws of the state. It’s of zero constitutional dimension that it have to pay a price for it. Certainly, each state is free to tax the corporation in its own way. Ask anyone trying to navigate the Washington Business & Occupation Tax. That it also has to deal with a different set of employment laws is not a big deal. Log in to Reply JustRuss says: April 27, 2017 at 1:06 am Yes, and it’s hardly an onerous burden. I used to work for a fairly small company that had offices in a dozen or so states. In Hawaii I was one of 4 employees, when I moved to Washington there were 5 of us. And the company clearly didn’t find it too difficult to comply with local labor laws and other regulations. This whining is pure BS. Log in to Reply JKTH says: April 26, 2017 at 10:05 pm All the arguments boil down “Give us more money” or “Don’t take money from us.” If there was a national standard that was unfavorable to them, they’d complain it’s one-size-fits-all.

If your father is dying, you can’t even go to the hospital for a few days and come back to the lumber mill or cheesecake factory and still have your job. It’s not even paid time off, it’s just the ability to take the time off and not be fired for the sock factory being inconvenienced. This is a concrete example where the apolitical and the political incompetents drive me nutz with their ignorance of which party does what for them or to them. This law was passed over a GOP president’s veto. Unpaid sick leave. Also, 50 states and one DC and some other jurisdictions sounds like job security for HR employees to me. Somehow I suspect rank and file HR employees weren’t behind this lobbying group’s founding. Log in to Reply Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply. You must be logged in to post a comment.

Published on April 26, 2017. The Lowdown is Ad Age's weekly look at news nuggets from across the world of marketing, including trends, campaign tidbits, executive comings and goings and more. Kendall Jenner in Pepsi's protests-and-unity-themed ad. Credit: Pepsi It was exactly three weeks ago when Pepsi pulled its much-criticized Kendall Jenner spot, causing embarrassment and loads of negative PR for the brand. But the people paid to track PepsiCo's financial performance have either forgotten about the incident or don't care. On Wednesday's first-quarter earnings call PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi didn't face a single question about the ad from Wall Street analysts. (She didn't bring it up, either.) Of course, the quarter ended before the ad fail, so if it had any effect at all on sales or revenue it would not be reflected in the numbers. But that hasn't previously stopped analysts from asking about their concerns for later quarters -- which didn't seem to be the case with the infamous ad. As for the first quarter itself, PepsiCo posted mixed results. Earnings-per-share of 94 cents topped expectations. But despite the earnings beat, "the quality of the quarter was disappointing as organic revenue, gross margin, and operating margin all came in weaker than we anticipated," J.P. Morgan said in a note to investors. On the call, Nooyi was quizzed about a range of non-Jenner topics, including how long-term risks like the impact of e-commerce on its ability to capture impulse purchases. "We are working on tools with all of our partners to make our categories look like impulse categories online," Nooyi responded, without giving details. "It's a work in process, but I must tell you that our growth rates are quite impressive." Dawn Air-Assist packaging. Credit: Procter & Gamble Co. One tactic to fuel e-commerce sales is to redo packaging, a tactic that Procter & Gamble Co. is testing. Its Air-Assist packaging for select home-care items, including Dawn, which simultaneously reduces risk of leakage in shipping, uses less material, costs less and looks better to consumers coming out of the box, Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said on the company's conference call April 26. E-commerce now represents 5% of P&G's global business, and grew 30% last quarter net of the effects of currency, acquisitions and divestitures, he said. Betty Crocker: How to Make a Big Top Circus Cake Credit: Betty Crocker via YouTube Startups keep getting attention, but when it comes to brand engagement, newer does not always mean better -- at least for packaged goods. The 10 most engaging consumer packaged goods brands in the U.S. are mostly well-established (read: older) names, according to a new report from brand and design firm Landor. The only brand on the list created in the 21st century is Plum Organics, the baby food brand founded in 2007 and acquired by Campbell Soup Co. in 2013. Others on the list include Betty Crocker, Burt's Bees, Dove, Gerber, Johnson & Johnson, Olay, Pillsbury, Trader Joe's, and Weight Watchers. For the Landor Pulse list, the WPP firm said it did research among 17,000 U.S. consumers, looking at measurements of brand attributes -- including whether it cares for customers, is trustworthy or helpful, and how it fares on social -- using the 2016 BrandAsset Valuator database. Landor said it looked at 933 brands. "Many people may assume that established CPG brands that have been around long before the age of social media are lagging behind, but the results of our Pulse indicate that not only are they keeping up, they are doing a better job than contemporary brands born into this era," Mary Zalla, Landor's global president of consumer brands, said in a statement. Speaking of old, the 101-year-old Toy Industry Association is getting an upgrade. The group, which boasts 1,098 members ranging from high-profile brands like Hasbro and Lego to smaller startups, is changing its name to Toy Association with a new tagline, "Inspiring Generations of Play," and logo that will change according to holidays and events. The association will also host an annual Play Fair for consumers, advertise for the first time in print and digital trade publications and sponsor other trade shows. It's spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on the rebranding, according to Steve Pasierb, president and CEO, who noted that the group is evolving to better address industry needs. "The industry is one that's constantly reinventing itself — it has to keep selling to new generations of parents and kids," he said. "You look at yourself as a 100-year-old organization and say do we make some tweaks or what if we tried to change everything, and that is what we did." A baby food fight has broken out over ad claims, pitting Beech-Nut against Gerber. Earlier this month the National Advertising Division, administered by the Council of Better Business Bureaus, recommended Beech-Nut discontinue certain claims in its ads that were challenged by bigger rival Gerber, but also found certain claims supported. Among its recommendations, NAD recommended Beech-Nut discontinue the claims "no one but us makes food for babies this way," "glass is the ultimate in sustainability," and "glass is nature's safest container." Beech-Nut said it would comply with the NAD's recommendations, but made it clear that challenges against parts of its "Real Food for Real Babies" campaign applied to work that it was no longer running. "Beech-Nut Nutrition Company supports the self-regulatory process and will comply with NAD's recommendations. The challenged ads have long since run their course, and Beech-Nut will consider NAD's recommendations for advertisements it produces in the future," the company said in a statement. In recent weeks, both companies launched new campaigns. Gerber's campaign focuses on the new "smart flow" spout on its pouch products. It was led by Terri & Sandy and Ogilvy, and created in partnership with Metavision (media), Edible (PR), Hogarth (production) and Match (Promotions). Beech-Nut's, from Scrum50, focuses on looking at labels on its glass jars, with an online component that's more focused on trying to stop labeling other moms. Here are the ads: VaynerMedia's Gary Vaynerchuk. Credit: Nathan Skid Gary Vaynerchuk, speaking at the Association of National Advertisers annual meeting last year, made plain his ambition to buy an orphan packaged-goods brand with great equity he can make greater. Now he's got his chance. Unilever wants to sell its margarine business (I Can't Believe It's Not Butter, etc.) and RB (Reckitt Benckiser) is "exploring strategic options" on French's Mustard and Frank's Red Hot Sauce. So is Vaynerchuk interested? Not really. While he was reportedly close on another unnamed brand recently, he said he sees such a deal coming "more in 24 to 48 months, not 24 to 48 weeks." He's interested in businesses with $50 million to $200 million in revenue. Categories he's most intrigued by are toothpaste and bubblegum. But he remains focused on running VaynerMedia, and doing such a deal may be based on having "a proper CEO in place to run VaynerMedia" though he may try to do both initially. He confirmed recent reports of layoffs -- "17 to 18 out of 750," net of new hires and promotions. Vaynerchuk said the layoffs reflected a shift toward creative services and away from production, and similar moves could come in the future as he shifts focus toward such areas as small business and consulting. Turning to this week's personnel moves … Both Quicken Loans and Citi have new marketing heads. Detroit-based Quicken Loans has tapped Casey Hurbis, who had been leading North American brand communications and advertising at Fiat, to replace former CMO and president Jay Farner. Farner was promoted to CEO earlier this year. Meanwhile on Tuesday, Citi promoted Jennifer Breithaupt, previously managing director of media, advertising and global entertainment, to global consumer CMO. Breithaupt, who was an Ad Age Woman to Watch last year, has been with Citi since 1999 and spearheaded the brand's initiatives to expand its entertainment sponsorships to drive loyalty with cardmembers. Conagra Brands Inc. named Barry Calpino as VP of innovation, reporting to Chief Growth Officer Darren Serrao. Calpino was most recently with Mondelez International, where he was VP, global platform innovation and had worked on the development of that company's new Véa brand. He is also an adjunct professor of marketing teaching innovation at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. He previously worked on innovation at Kraft Foods. Contributing: E.J.

Shuchi Bansal A still from an Brooke Bond Red Label’s ad titled ‘Forgotten’. In its new advertisement released last month, tea brand Brooke Bond Red Label from the Hindustan Unilever Ltd stable, featured an elderly woman who suffers from Alzheimer’s. She is tended to by her neighbour, whom she mistakes for her son as the young man often drops by to share a cup of tea with her. Titled “Forgotten”, the heartwarming ad shows how people with a neurological ailment like Alzheimer’s face social alienation. This isn’t the first time that Red Label has brewed a socially inclusive piece of advertising. Its “Six pack band” video on India’s first transgender band won the prestigious Glass Lion award at the Cannes Grand Prix last year. More recently, another ad from cough and cold brand Vicks (from Procter and Gamble) focuses on a transgender mother and her young daughter. The digital film titled “Touch of Care” also takes an inclusive approach and deals with the sensitive subject of transgender rights in India. Interestingly, advertising of late is increasingly, truly, more inclusive and socially representative, featuring single mothers, differently abled people, transgenders, special children and much else. It highlights issues and themes that were earlier alien to brands and advertisers, who were more clichéd and conformist in their communication. Clearly, the messaging is moving beyond pretty pictures and perfect families. So whether it was a class full of special children in the Lenovo Yoga commercial last year or the eBay Things Don’t Judge ad which featured a gay couple, a male kathak dancer and a Muslim woman celebrating Diwali, there is more slice-of-life advertising which is realistic and all-encompassing. Brands, looking beyond society stereotypes, are not fighting shy of diversity in their communication. It’s not difficult to see the reasons behind this change. For a start, society itself is changing. “There is a lot of acceptance. Of course there is a lot of intolerance too. But notwithstanding that, young people are expressing their voice. The attitude of people to different issues is changing,” says K.V. Sridhar, founder of the creative outfit Hyper Collective. There are indeed more conversations around subjects like gender equality, transgender rights, differently abled people and other relevant social concerns. According to Santosh Padhi, chief creative officer and co-founder at Taproot Dentsu, advertising is more realistic and more human now. “We always try and portray things that people care about or that they follow. Brands have to catch and present the flavour of the season in an engaging, interesting way. And the conversations being presented are happening right now. We can’t push things down people’s throats,” he says. However, Bobby Pawar, managing director and chief creative officer at Publicis South Asia, feels that the advertising being generated stems from the brands’ need to have a purpose. “And brands find a purpose which is relevant to their DNA. Vicks, for instance, is related to care for the family. It reflects upon mother and child relationship. This time it found a different mother. So that comes from its DNA.” Agrees Sridhar who says that brands must play a role in a consumer’s life: “The value a brand lives by should be common to my values. However, in the case of the latest Vicks ad, the focus is wider and the brand says it cares about all families irrespective of the gender. It does not discriminate. So it is a much wider value.” There may be societal friction and cultural differences, but the brand, Vicks in this case, takes a stand. The point of view is important here, says Sridhar, adding that there’s not just market leadership but thought leadership as well. Agrees Pawar: “Advertising, at most times, reflects society, sometimes it leads it.” Why advertising may be changing is also because brands desperately need to connect with people. They need to build affinity in an age where the buying experience is moving online leaving fewer opportunities for emotional touch points. So if brands are talking to millennials, these are the issues that are important to them. There are other reasons as well. Swati Bhattacharya, chief creative officer, FCB Ulka India, says in the world we live in today everyone has access to different stories thanks to digital media. “We are constantly sharing different stories. But there’s hunger for more. Brands have realised that only the most unusual and best stories will survive. So they have to excite or completely touch somebody deeply or nudge the society in a particular direction,” she says. Besides, great stories can also be differentiators for brands to stand out in a clutter where they are being commoditized. “The ideas behind more inclusive advertising is to be top of mind, be a better story teller and get the best recall,” says Padhi, adding that today people appreciate diversity. Women’s rights, child education, gay rights, cleanliness are issues they empathise with. To be sure, India struggles with a lot of issues. “And brands taking up these issues is not a bad thing. Advertising influences people. It can help change behaviour even if it has a subtle impact,” says Padhi. Shuchi Bansal is Mint’s media, marketing and advertising editor.

Just Because Your Electric Toothbrush Makes A Lot Of Noise Doesn’t Mean It’s Effective Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Just Because Your Electric Toothbrush Makes A Lot Of Noise Doesn’t Mean It’s Effective April 26, 2017 1:49 pm EDT By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk advertising brusha brusha brusha dental hygiene electric toothbrushes marketing nad national advertising division toothbrushes Much like the never-ending game of oneupmanship in the razor industry, makers of toothbrushes are constantly touting unique features that promise to make your teeth that much whiter and brighter than the competition. But now one ad industry watchdog is calling foul on a commercial that implies a noisy toothbrush is somehow more effective at cleaning your chompers. The National Advertising Division — an investigative unit of the advertising industry’s system of self-regulation system administered by the Council of Better Business Bureaus — has recommended that Philips Oral Healthcare discontinue some claims it’s made about its Sonicare Electric Toothbrushes, including the suggestion that the Sonicare is better because you can hear it working. Rival company Procter & Gamble, which makes Oral-B electric toothbrushes, challenged claims made in “Start Your Day” Sonicare ads. In that TV spot Philips says, “This is the sound of sonic technology cleaning deep between teeth. [Powers on Oral-B 7000…] Hear the difference?” NAD considered whether the ad implied that the respective “sounds” of the Sonicare and Oral-B technology correlate to superior efficacy for the Sonicare brushes and brush heads. After reviewing the advertiser’s “sound of sonic technology” claims, NAD says it was “unpersuaded” by the argument that consumers would walk away only with the message that the Sonicare FlexCare is more pleasing to the ear than the Oral-B 7000. “NAD observed that Philips linked the sound of its sonic technology with a specific comparative performance benefit in the challenged advertising,” the group says. In its decision, NAD notes that a voiceover in the ad states, “[t]his is the sound of Sonicare technology cleaning deep between teeth” as the Sonicare device was turned on and an animated simulation depicted the FlexCare Platinum forcefully pushing water between teeth. The watchdog concluded that at least one of the messages consumers could reasonably take away was of superior efficacy, and that the sound of sonic technology correlates to superior performance benefit of Sonicare over Oral-B at “cleaning deep between teeth.” NAD has recommended that Philips discontinue that claim, as well as others related to how much plaque the brush can remove compared to its competitor. Philips says in a statement that it “appreciates the NAD’s consideration of this challenge but respectfully disagrees with the NAD’s findings and recommendation regarding the Start Your Day advertisement” and will appeal the NAD’s decision to the National Advertising Review Board.

"Following" : "Follow"}} April 26, 2017 12:46pm   Comments Share: Even though earnings might be a little overshadowed by the big tax reform announcement planned for today, that won’t likely  detract from the mostly positive first-quarter results across sectors. Dow components Boeing Co (NYSE: BA), Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG), and United Technologies Corporation (NYSE: UTX) all reported earnings this morning that beat expectations. UTX’s revenue also beat expectations, but revenue for PG and BA came in slightly below forecasts. Next up, Under Armour Inc (NYSE: UA) (NYSE: UAA) and MGM Resorts International (NYSE: MGM) report before market open tomorrow, April 27.    Under Armour: What Might Be in Store After Tough Q4? It’s been a tough environment for brick-and-mortar retailers in general, but it’s been particularly tough for sporting goods retailers. There’s been a string of bankruptcies as ecommerce disrupted the industry, the largest being Sports Authority when it liquidated in 2016 and shuttered all its locations. That can put pressure on companies’ such as UA and Nike Inc (NYSE: NKE) wholesale business, but it also can pressure profit margins as full-price products struggle to compete with cheaper merchandise being liquidated in store closings—two impacts commonly cited over the past year on sporting apparel companies’ earnings calls. UA is expected to post a loss of $0.04 per share—its first projected loss in the past 8 quarters—on revenue of $1.1 billion, according to consensus third-party analyst estimates. Up until last quarter, the company had 26 consecutive quarters of revenue growth over 20%. UA and UAA, the two classes of the company’s stock, lost about half their value over the past year. The options market has priced in about a 8.4% potential stock move in either direction around UA’s earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswim platform. In short-term options trading at the April 28 weekly expiration, calls were active at the 19 and 20 strike prices while puts were active at the 17 and 17.5 strikes. The implied volatility sits at the 56th percentile. Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Put options represent the right, but not the obligation to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Gambling and Casinos with MGM Earnings Vegas might be the thing that comes to most people’s minds when they think of casinos, but attention has been increasingly shifting to Macau—Asia’s gambling mecca. Macau gaming revenue, a metric widely followed by casino analysts, jumped 13% in the first three months this year. Many analysts think that increase could potentially translate into higher profits for casinos with operations there. Instinet analyst Harry Curtis recently pointed out MGM has been heavily investing in new projects, including its new $3 billion MGM Cotai in Macau. Curtis expects free cash flow to increase significantly once those projects end, allowing it to potentially increase dividends or buy back shares.  For the first quarter, MGM is expected to report earnings of $0.26 per share--up $0.13 from Q1 2016—on revenue of $2.6 billion, according to consensus third-party analyst estimates. The company missed analyst earnings estimates by a wide margin in the last quarter, causing the stock to tumble 9.3% in trading that day. The options market has priced in about a 4% potential stock move in either direction around MGM’s earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator. In short-term options trading at the April 28 weekly expiration, calls were active at the 28.5 and 29 strike prices while puts were active at the 28 strike. The implied volatility sits at the 51st percentile.  If you haven’t had a chance, check out what might be expected when Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F), General Motors Company (NYSE: GM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) report earnings this week.

By WallaceWitkowski Reporter AnoraMahmudova Reporter U.S. stocks closed fractionally lower Wednesday, retreating from intraday highs after an outline of President Donald Trump’s tax plan was seen as light on detail. The S&P 500 index SPX, -0.05% which earlier had traded briefly above its previous closing high set March 1, finished down 1.16 points, or less than 0.1%, at 2,387.45. Seven out of the S&P 500’s 11 sectors finished lower ground with real-estate and consumer-staples stocks the largest decliners. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.10% fell 21.03 points, or 0.1%, at 20,975.09, following disappointing first-quarter earnings from Dow components, Procter & Gamble Co. PG, -2.51%  and Boeing Co. BA, -0.98% with both stocks leading decliners on the benchmark. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.00% finished down 0.27 points at 6,025.23, just short of its closing high, after touching an intraday all-time high of 6,040.89, a day after the tech-laden index surpassed the psychologically important level of 6,000 for the first time ever. On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn rolled out a one-page outline of Trump’s tax-reform plan in a news conference, promising more details later. See: Live blog and video of Trump tax plan rollout by Mnuchin and Cohn While offering a useful guide what the White House wants to do, the lack of more detail contributed to some subsequent weakness, said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex. Read: Full text of Trump administration tax principles The proposal, for example, calls for a one-time tax break on “trillions of dollars held overseas,” but doesn’t specify the rate. “The market was looking for more specific color on rates and the reduction of exemptions, but color on the repatriation tax, which is the single most important issue, was left unaddressed by that press conference,” Colas said in an interview. Investors had not been expecting anything other than a broad outline of the tax reform, but hoped for something with more clarity than previously vague descriptions like “massive” or “phenomenal”, said Quincy Krosby, market strategist, at Prudential Financial. Krosby noted that earnings, especially revenue growth has been underpinning the market as well as optimism about tax reform. Read: Trump’s tax reform could lift the stock-market to new heights Promises of a tax plan have been one of the linchpins of recent gains for risk assets and is likely to be a significant driver of trading action across asset classes as more details emerge. “There’s an existential problem with any kind of legislation as an investment catalyst,” Convergex’s Colas said. “Unlike earnings, this is not a specific event, this is a slow, grinding process that does not lend itself to being an investment catalyst.” Also in focus was a potential government shutdown this weekend. Some of those concerns, however, may have eased after Trump backed off on a demand for funding for a wall between the U.S.-Mexico border. See: Should Wall Street fear a government shutdown? Here’s how stocks fared in the past Earnings season: The season continues in full swing, with a deluge of results. Shares of PepsiCo Inc. PEP, -0.73% finished down 0.7% even as earnings beat analyst forecast. Anthem Inc. ANTM, +3.81%  shares rose 3.8% after results topped expectations. Twitter Inc. TWTR, +7.91%  closed up 7.9%, after the social media company beat first-quarter earnings expectations. Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. CMG, +2.38%  rose 2% after the casual restaurant chain reported first-quarter earnings ahead of forecasts late Tuesday. Edwards Lifesciences Corp. EW, +10.49%  shares rallied more than 10% after the medical-device maker topped Wall Street estimates for the quarter. Wyndham Worldwide Corp. WYN, +9.02% shares surged 9% following its first revenue beat since the fourth quarter of 2015. Seagate Technology PLC STX, -16.83%  shares dropped nearly 17% after the data storage company’s revenue for the quarter missed expectations. Arconic Inc. ARNC, +1.93%  shares rose 1.9% after the aerospace and car maker supplier’s earnings out late Tuesday topped Wall Street estimates. Other markets: Stocks in Asia closed mainly higher, propelled by optimism over the prospect of a U.S. tax overhaul. European markets ended higher, after surging to historic highs following the first round of the French presidential election on Sunday.

Every large online platform should be working feverishly to develop reliable, accurate content filters, the authors argue. Credit: iStock Most Popular The world of online marketing now resembles a tremendous game of advertising truth or dare. For a long time, marketers took the dare, by purchasing ads without knowing where their ad would run or why it would run there. The dare then: risk sitting out online advertising or jump in while your brand had no real control over where and when your ads ran. The result was often calamitous: a company's ads ran on sites that presented entirely inappropriate content, sometimes bordering on criminal hate speech that were absolutely not where advertisers hoped their ads would land. Now we are entering the truth phase of the game. In recent weeks, major marketers pulled advertising from Google sites, including YouTube. Companies leading the exodus include Johnson & Johnson, Walmart, Verizon, AT&T, General Motors, Pepsico and FX Networks. Others, such as Procter & Gamble, have been threatening to pull digital advertising dollars for several months before that because of concerns about costs versus benefits. As the public outrage rose from a whisper to a din, advertising on these mammoth digital platforms began to fall noticeably. A mess in the making How did we even get into this mess? By failing to update our practices for changing technologies. We cannot continue to treat online advertising the same as television advertising. They are fundamentally different. Purchasing TV ads in packages works because TV content is curated. The worst that can happen is that your ad airs while no one is watching. Related Stories World Wide Whitelist: Will Brand Safety Strip the Web of Its Color? But that strategy -- or lack thereof -- doesn't work amid the online free-for-all of amateur self-expression. Online, it no longer behooves companies to take the dare and gamble for that perfect spot while risking landing in the worst spot. The potential downside of a consumer revolt by appearing in the wrong place vastly outweighs the potential upside this model offers. Need proof that online advertising strategy needs an overhaul? Take this recent New York Times headline: "Chase Had Ads on 400,000 Sites. Then Just 5,000. Same Results." Their new strategy: advertise only on pre-approved sites rather than through targeted ad words. And guess what? No impact on either cost of placement or response rate. Astonishing. At the same time, the $70 billion spent on digital advertising in 2016 overtook traditional television advertising ($67 billion in 2016) for the first time. And that's just how huge web platforms like Google, YouTube and Facebook would like to keep it. Why? Because it is too costly and complicated for them to operate with an advertising model focused on quality content. They much prefer the idea of companies buying ads at random, rather than holding them accountable for stricter placement strategies, or content and editorial filtering, or censorship. That train left the station long ago, as these internet giants focused on their own interest in growing dominance through traffic growth, with little or no regard for any content responsibility. And the result of that early strategy to deny content responsibility is, in part, why we are here today. It would be prudent for the CEO of any large online platform to work feverishly to develop reliable, accurate filters to immediately address the concerns of those placing ads on their site, and so guarantee ads are colocated with appropriate, high quality content. Playing the random advertising placement game is not worth getting the wrong answer to the question of online ad effectiveness. Technology always outpaces society's ability to cope. Online advertising, initially a novel and effective means of marketing and advertising, might now have become so over-used and over-rated that we are entering a new phase of consumer apathy. And that shift is both game-changing and dangerous for all players involved.

(GuruFocus) Generally speaking, the bigger the size of the company, the more difficult it is to grow. This concept was front-and-center after two major Dow components signaled to investors growing their business isn't an easy task. Procter & Gamble Shares of Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG) were trading lower by more than 2 percent Wednesday after the $226-billion consumer packaged goods company reported its first-quarter results — in which earnings and revenue fell short of expectations. According to a Bloomberg report, sales during the quarter fell 1 percent year-over-year to $15.6 billion, missing the $15.7 billion analysts were expecting. The company's new CEO David Taylor attributed the revenue miss to a slowdown in overall growth, geopolitical disruptions and foreign-exchange woes. Meanwhile, the company's products may be out of favor among consumers who don't care about branding and place an emphasis on price. For example, sales of P&G's Gillette-branded razors and blades are facing pressure from upstart rivals such as Dollar Shave Club, which was acquired by rival Unilever plc (ADR) (NYSE: UL). Overall, grooming products declined by 6 percent in the quarter with shaving products leading the way in declines. Boeing Boeing Co (NYSE: BA), a fellow Dow component valued at $110 billion, also reported its first-quarter results Wednesday. Unlike P&G, Boeing's print was mixed as the company reported better-than-expected earnings per share but revenue fell short of expectations. Revenue fell more than 7 percent to $20.976 billion, also missing the $21.34 billion analysts were expecting; Boeing delivered 169 commercial jets in the quarter, marking the fewest since the first quarter of 2014. Looking forward, Boeing boosted its full-year 2017 earnings-per-share outlook from $9.10–$9.30 to $9.20–$9.40 per share. However, this doesn't mean the company's growth prospects and jet deliveries are expected to increase. According to a separate Bloomberg report, Boeing's improved earnings outlook could be attributed to the better tax environment. More telling, the company didn't raise its cash outlook — a key metric for investors as orders for aircraft are fading late into the sales cycle. "The stock has been a high flier for a while," George Ferguson, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said. "People clearly had high expectations and this was a middling report."

Buying interest has remained somewhat subdued, however, limiting the upside for the major averages. Currently, the major averages are just above the unchanged line. The Dow is up 33.67 points or 0.2 percent at 21,029.79, the Nasdaq is up 1.71 points or less than 0.1 percent at 6,027.20 and the S&P 500 is up 4.60 points or 0.2 percent at 2,393.21. While the markets have benefited from recent upward momentum, traders seem reluctant to make significant moves following the release of a mixed batch of quarterly results. Shares of Twitter (TWTR) are moving sharply higher after the social media giant reported better than expected first quarter results. Restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is also seeing notable strength after reporting first quarter results that exceeded analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Boeing (BA) also reported first quarter earnings that exceeded analyst estimates, although the aerospace giant reported revenues that came in below expectations. Consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (PG) also reported better than expected third quarter earnings on weaker than expected revenues. Shares of U.S. Steel (X) are likely to come under pressure after the steel giant reported a wider than expected first quarter loss on weaker than expected revenues. Oil service stocks have shown a significant move to the upside on the day, driving the Philadelphia Oil Service Index up by 2 percent. The strength in the sector comes amid an increase by the price of crude oil. Natural gas and railroad stocks have also moved notably higher, while weakness is visible among electronic storage and trucking stocks. In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region extended a recent upward move during trading on Wednesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index surged up by 1.1 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index advanced by 0.5 percent. The major European markets have also moved to the upside on the day. While the German DAX Index has inched up by 0.1 percent, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index and the French CAC 40 Index are both up by 0.3 percent. In the bond market, treasuries are regaining ground after trending lower in recent sessions. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is down by nearly a basis point at 2.318 percent. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Giraffes On The Savannah: Africa's 10 Tallest Skyscrapers The 10 Biggest Imports in the USA Friendly Skies: Best Airlines for Customer Satisfaction Previous Story Next Story More Top Stories European Shares Seen Lower On Trump Tax-plan Disappointment Samsung Q1 Profit Climbs, Sees Higher Earnings Ahead; Stock Up Asian Markets Mostly Lower Amid Cautious Trades Gainers & Losers Of Apr.26: AKBA, FLKS, BIOL, BABY, FLXN...

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 20.68 points, or 0.10%, at 20,975.44, and the S&P 500 shaved off 1.16 points, or 0.05%, to 2,387.45 The Nasdaq Composite was down 6.52 0.27 points at 6,025.23. The biggest mover on the Dow was Procter & Gamble, which fell nearly 2.5%. The drugs giant reporting an 8.3% fall in third-quarter profit, caused by slowing consumer spending President Donald Trump proposed slashing the US tax rate on corporate and pass-through business profits to 15% from 35% or more. The administration is determined to get the tax reform done by this year, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said. The promise of a massive tax cut has been at the core of the post-election rally, which has driven Wall Street's indexes to record highs. However, the rally has stalled of late due to a lack of clarity on Trump's policies and the failure of his healthcare reform bill.

"We had a slowdown because tax returns were delayed," said Nooyi during a conference call with Wall Street analysts. "At the end of the first quarter, business started to pick up again." Procter & Gamble (pg) also said Wednesday that delayed tax refunds hurt its sales, while Hershey (hsy) CEO Michele Buck made a passing reference to the delays during her first-quarter comments to analysts. Broadly, Big Food executives have said the industry suffered from some softness during the quarter. Overall, PepsiCo (pep) reported a 2% increase in revenue to $12.05 billion as volume grew globally and the company's prices increased. Results were boosted by growth for North America's Frito-Lay and beverages businesses, while Quaker Foods posted a modest decline. Results were generally stronger in PepsiCo's foreign markets. Overall revenue and core earnings of 94 cents were each better than Wall Street had expected. "Globally, our business is looking good," Nooyi said during the call. She touted the strong position for the company in the U.S. and Europe, as well as most of Latin America, excluding economically weak Brazil, Argentina, and Venezuela. Those markets have also been problematic for PepsiCo's top rival, Coca-Cola (ko). On Tuesday, Coke reported flat volume for the first quarter and said it would cut 1,200 jobs, the latest major food manufacturer to accelerate cost-cutting efforts as the industry struggles with a weak growth outlook. Wall Street analysts honed in on PepsiCo's 1.5% volume drop for the Frito-Lay North America business, a unit that includes Fritos, Doritos, and Tostitos and had been a steady performer until the most recent first quarter. PepsiCo executives downplayed the slight dip in volume, blaming it on some challenges to the company's Sabra business (which they say have been resolved) and the calendar timing of the New Year's holiday. "Snacks are a simple pleasure of life," Nooyi said. "What we are doing is making our snacks more permissible." She added that a variety of changes PepsiCo is making to that salty snack portfolio, including the reduction of sodium levels and fat used in those products, is making those brands more acceptable to an American audience that says it wants to eat better. PepsiCo's position is that it can make snacks a bit healthier through research and development efforts, but also still let consumers indulge when they want. "We feel good about the state of our business," said Nooyi. "We are on track to deliver our full-year financial targets." PepsiCo on Wednesday reiterated it sees organic revenue increasing by at least 3% for 2017.

The major index futures are currently pointing to a roughly flat open for the markets, with the Dow futures down by just 11 points. A lack of major U.S. economic data may keep traders on the sidelines as traders digest a mixed batch of quarterly results. Shares of Twitter (TWTR) are moving sharply higher in pre-market trading after the social media giant reported better than expected first quarter results. Restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) could also see early strength after reporting first quarter results that exceeded analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Boeing (BA) also reported first quarter earnings that exceeded analyst estimates, although the aerospace giant reported revenues that came in below expectations. Consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (PG) also reported better than expected third quarter earnings on weaker than expected revenues. Shares of U.S. Steel (X) are likely to come under pressure after the steel giant reported a wider than expected first quarter loss on weaker than expected revenues. Traders may also be reluctant to make significant moves as they await President Donald Trump's announcement on his tax reform plan. Stocks moved mostly higher during trading on Tuesday, adding to the strong gains posted on Monday. With the continued upward move, the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed to a new record closing high. The major averages closed firmly in positive territory but off their best levels of the day. The Dow jumped 232.23 points or 1.1 percent to 20,996.12, the Nasdaq climbed 41.67 points or 0.7 percent to 6,025.49 and the S&P 500 rose 14.46 points or 0.6 percent to 2,388.61. In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region extended a recent upward move during trading on Wednesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index surged up by 1.1 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index advanced by 0.5 percent. Meanwhile, the major European markets are seeing modest weakness on the day. While the German DAX Index has dipped by 0.2 percent, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index and the French CAC 40 Index are both down by 0.1 percent. In commodities trading, crude oil futures are slipping $0.29 to $49.27 a barrel after rising $0.33 to $49.56 a barrel on Tuesday. Gold futures, which fell $10.30 to $1,267.20 an ounce in the previous session, are dipping $3 to $1,264.20 an ounce. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 111.44 yen compared to the 111.09 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Tuesday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.0891 compared to yesterday's $1.0926. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Giraffes On The Savannah: Africa's 10 Tallest Skyscrapers The 10 Biggest Imports in the USA Friendly Skies: Best Airlines for Customer Satisfaction Previous Story Next Story More Top Stories European Shares Seen Lower On Trump Tax-plan Disappointment Samsung Q1 Profit Climbs, Sees Higher Earnings Ahead; Stock Up Asian Markets Mostly Lower Amid Cautious Trades Gainers & Losers Of Apr.26: AKBA, FLKS, BIOL, BABY, FLXN...

Santiago Wednesday, April 26, 2017 TechTank Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Print SMS More Reddit Google Stumbleupon The rise of cognitive computing systems (CCSs) brings a potentially massive shift in the way that work is done, which could lead to an equally massive displacement of the workforce. Advanced automation is already reshaping low-skill and even medium-skill jobs, and tasks once done by so-called ‘knowledge workers’ are now done by machines (think of financial services). Given that up to 47 percent of current jobs are likely to be automated by 2034, this suggests massive labor market upheaval.  Additionally, the Obama White House estimated that 83 percent of workers making less than $20 per hour are likely to lose their job due to automation. In short, it doesn’t take a crystal ball to see the potential for significant job displacement, particularly of low- and middle-skilled workers. Authors Kevin C. Desouza Nonresident Senior Fellow - Governance Studies, Center for Technology Innovation Twitter KevDesouza G Gregory S. Dawson Faculty member - School of Accountancy, Arizona State University Senior Faculty Associate - Center for Organization Research and Design, ASU B Bryce A. Santiago Graduate Student - W.P. Carey School of Business, Arizona State University While the public sector lags the private sector in the adoption of innovation in general, the public sector adopts innovation as rapidly as the private sector in some cases. We already see evidence of the public sector adopting advanced automation: Hong Kong’s Immigration Department uses AI algorithms to sort visa, passport, and residency applications. The algorithms scan and sort each application into one of three categories: clearly approved, clearly denied, or uncertain. A visa officer then reviews the material and makes a decision. Singapore’s government deployed a virtual assistant – ‘ask Jasmine’ – to reduce the number of calls to the customer centers. Further, residents and businesses in Singapore can utilize ‘ask Jasmine’ to file tax returns. Many focus on the potential of these technologies to augment the capabilities of human workers. For instance, American Express and Procter & Gamble are investing in cognitive computing systems to improve business operations, but are not planning to eliminate employees. Both companies view these machines as job enhancements and not replacements, stressing the importance of augmentation over automation. The companies believe cognitive computing will result in business growth and create more jobs. While these technologies will initially augment work, they will no doubt eventually replace human workers. For example, the private sector is experimenting with “chatbots”, a form of AI, to automate and replace customer service workers. Steve Nichols, Georgia’s chief technology officer, quickly pointed out that Georgia’s Department of Human Services could use these same chatbots to respond to the routine questions asked of human services employees.

West and Jack Karsten Monday, October 26, 2015 TechTank 10 New Innovations That Could Change the World Hillary Schaub and Joshua Bleiberg Tuesday, June 10, 2014 TechTank How technology is changing manufacturing Darrell M. West Thursday, June 2, 2016 Today, AI has already mastered bluffing, a trait that some might argue is deeply human. Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University developed an AI system called Libratus that won $1,766,250 by defeating the world’s best poker players. Until now, machines could beat humans when it came to games where all players have perfect information, such as chess. Now  machines can work with imperfect information and strategically deceive their opponents. Looking to the future, one can expect that these AI will increase in sophistication. Consider the recently released AutoDraw tool from Google that uses AI to guess the subject of a drawing and then complete it. Researchers and technology enthusiasts are working feverishly to build systems that can mimic some of the most deeply human traits from creativity and empathy. Recently, pundits from all sectors have examined the economic impacts of greater automation through one of the first examples of CCSs – robots. Bill Gates has argued that robots should incur a tax at parity with the workers they replace. If a robot replaces a worker who makes $50,000 annually, the robot would be taxed at the same $50,000 income level and the tax revenue would be used to retrain the displaced worker. While this makes intuitive sense, the idea has its critics. Lawrence Summers, former Director of the National Economic Council under President Obama, makes the case that taxing technology may create a disincentive for companies to further invest in research and development for their systems, leading to an aggregate decrease in innovation that would negatively impact society at large. Evidence from the public and private sector portend a greater adoption of AI. In the public sector, this has the power to significantly enhance government’s service to citizens. In addition, AI holds the potential to displace low- and middle-income workers in substantial numbers. This disruption requires holistic thinking about consequences across the entire social, political, and economic ecosystem. Towards this end, the U.S. must consider modernizing its higher-education systems to prepare the workforce for this possibility. It is important for policymakers to plan for a new economic system where machine-to-machine interactions fundamentally alter the nature of work, the design of organizations, and the execution of transactions.

Impressive quarterly reports were delivered by a number of large-cap companies amid more general optimism, as investors await further details regarding the President’s planed tax cuts along with broad confidence that Macron will succeed in becoming France’s next President. The Nasdaq spiked up more than 0.7%, sending the index above 6,000 for this first time ever, while the Dow Jones rose more than 200 points, with results from Caterpillar driving the construction sector as Dupont and McDonald’s also pleased both at the top and bottom lines, leaving just Coca-Cola missing analyst’s best expectations. Banking, Biotech, Chemical, Computer Hardware and Networking Stocks all performed well. Economic releases, however, presented more of a mixed bag, with new home sales seeing a substantial increase in March contrasting a separate report from the Conference Board that showed a larger than expected pullback in consumer confidence for April, although the index still remains at a strong level. More than 190 S&P components are expected to have reported by the end of the week, with other big names scheduled to release quarterlies this afternoon including Boeing, PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble, Twitter, United Technologies. But against this background, Trump was forced yesterday to delay his push to secure federal funds to build his promised border wall with Mexico, in order to eliminate a sticking point as lawmakers work to avoid the looming government shutdown. Asian traders this morning also expressed relief that relieved that, other than staging a brief military drill as the USS Michigan nuclear submarine docked in Busan, no significant gestures were received from Pyongyang as North Korea’s 85th People’s Army Day drew to a close. This allowed the region to extend its gains for the third day, picking up a hint from positive US and European closes during early morning trade, with Japan putting in the strongest performance, although the ASX and Hang Seng were not far behind and, more modestly, the Shanghai Composite also reversed early losses to end in the positive. European stocks also closed higher yesterday as French manufacturing sentiment strengthened to a near six-year high in April, leading the Stoxx Europe 600 to rise 0.2% while recording its fifth consecutive session of gains. The FTSE-100 put almost as much on, as safe-haven assets, like Gold and Government Bonds, continued to retreat. There is no UK or EU macro data due today, although Theresa May hosts Jean-Claude Juncker and EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier in London. The US releases MBA Mortgage Applications and EIA Crude Stocks change numbers. UK corporates due to report earnings or trading updates include Antofagasta (ANTO.L), Fresnillo (FRES.L), CRH (CRH.L), Standard Chartered (STAN.L), The London Stock Exchange (LSE.L), GSK (GSK.L), Boohoo.com (BOO.L) and Tullow Oil (TLW.L). Investors will also be keen to hear more from the EU’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, following reports that Brussells wishes to expand its dialogue with Russia on key foreign policy issues, the first significant sign of a thaw in relations and a move that seemingly reflects growing concerns regarding the U.S.’s unpredictable international policy. London equities are seen having trouble sustaining recent upward momentum, with mining giant BHP Billiton cutting its annual guidance for coking coal and copper this morning, the FTSE-100 to be down 10 or so points during opening trade. " - Barry Gibb, Research Analyst   Markets Europe The FTSE-100 finished yesterday's session 0.15% higher at 7,275.64 whilst the FTSE AIM All-Share index was 0.47% up at 957.29. In continental Europe, the CAC-40 finished up 0.17% at 5,277.88 whilst the DAX was 0.10% higher at 12,467.04. Wall Street In New York last night, the Dow Jones rose 1.12% to 20,996.12, the S&P 500 firmed 0.61% to 2388.61 and the Nasdaq gained 0.7% to 6025.49. Asia In Asian markets this morning, the Nikkei 225 had risen 0.93% to 19,257.42, while the Hang Seng firmed 0.58% to 24,598.85. Oil In early trade today, WTI crude was down 0.18% to $49.47/bbl and Brent was down 0.13% to $52.03/bbl.   Headlines Boohoo online fashion retailer sees its profits double Annual pre-tax profits at online fashion retailer Boohoo (BOO.L) have almost doubled to £31m - up from just under £16m last year. Its sales have jumped by 51% to almost £300m, thanks to new overseas markets. The Manchester-based firm puts its success down to "combining cutting-edge, aspirational design with an affordable price tag". Its booming sales growth has also been reflected in its share price, which has more than trebled in the past year. On its stock market flotation in 2014, it was valued at £560m. It is now worth about £2bn. The firm has gone from strength to strength in recent years, while its High Street rivals have had to deal with increasing competition from Boohoo and other online retailers. Source: BBC News   Company news Arian Silver (LON:AGQ, 0.93p) – Speculative Buy Arian Silver Corporation, a Mexico focused resource exploration company, announced today that it will allow its option with Tierra Nuevo Mining Ltd over the Noche Buena gold and silver tailings project to lapse unexercised. As a result, the Company will now focus on its recently acquired lithium projects in Zacatecas State, Mexico. Metallurgical and mineralogical test works undertaken by Resource Development Inc (RDI) of Denver, Colorado (USA) demonstrated that the tailings were highly refractory and include gangue minerals that would inhibit extraction of gold and silver as well as attract penalties levied by potential purchasers of any concentrate produced. Our view: Whist the metallurgical results are disappointing in terms of recovery potential from the Noche Buena tailings, we note that this is an inherent risk when attempting to reprocess tailings material. As such, Arian can now focus on its recent acquired lithium prospects. We look forward to more positive updates from the first batch of assay results from the lithium projects which are expected imminently with a preliminary technical report to follow soon afterward. We maintain a Speculative Buy rating on the stock. Beaufort Securities acts as corporate broker to Arian Silver plc   AFC Energy (LON:AFC, 11.50p) – Speculative Buy The industrial fuel cell power company, yesterday announced a new phase of the its partnership with Industrie De Nora SpA. AFC Energy and De Nora are now expanding this Joint Development Agreement collaboration into Phase 2, following successful Phase 1 completion. As part of this, the two Groups expect to finalise the design of a commercial fuel cell electrode and stack during the current year for commercial application which is capable of mass automated production with warranted performance metrics. Focus will be on the integration of the best performing electrodes from Phase 1 to derive a frozen baseline technology platform. They expect to commence dialogue on terms for a long-term electrode supply agreement building on De Nora's proven know how in the automation of manufacturing processes. Demonstration of the new upscaled and enhanced fuel cell system is planned at AFC Energy's Stade industrial scale fuel cell plant in Germany in the second half of 2017. The validation will include the metrics associated with power output, longevity, efficiency and availability. Our view: De Nora's track record in industrial electro-chemistry application, capacity for manufacture and the commitment to deliver significantly cuts risks entailed in this ambitious project. Being able to warrant performance of electrodes, in terms of performance parameters and target cost, places AFC Energy, together with its commercial project partners, in a preeminent position to become preferred supplier of fuel cell systems, while also providing targeted industries with the necessary confidence to proceed in adoption of the technology. Within this, AFC expected to offer highest performance in terms of duration of continuous operation, availability based on hydrogen purity standard. Importantly, the partnership with will also allow AFC Energy to set its cost structure (modelled to result in a cost per kWh competitive amongst several of today's conventional and renewable energy generation technologies) by leveraging De Nora's manufacturing, supply chains and procurement strength. Beaufort accordingly repeats its Speculative Buy recommendation, although in consideration of the likely challenges and costs that remain with respect to securing early commercial take-up, the price target for AFC has now been set at 23p/share.   CityFibre Infrastructure (LON:CITY, 55.50p) – Speculative Buy CityFibre Infrastructure (‘CityFibre’), the leading designer, builder, owner, and operator of fibre optic infrastructure in UK towns and cities, yesterday announced results for the year ended 31 December 2016 (‘FY2016’). During the period, revenue advanced by +140% to £15.4m, against the comparative period (FY2015). Together with +2% improvement in gross margin to 88%, the Group recorded adjusted EBITDA of £2.5m compared to loss of £2.9m a year ago. Operating loss was £5.1m (FY2015: £6.2m), due to higher administrative costs of £18.7m (FY2015: £11.7m). Underlying administrative costs (excluding non-recurring costs and other charges) rose by +31% to £11.1m primarily due to increased average headcount. Loss after tax widened to £12.6m (FY2015: loss £6.4m), which includes financing costs of £7.3m (FY2015: £0.3m). Cash and cash equivalents at the period-end was £16.7m. Net debt stood at £43.1m at period end. On the operational front, CityFibre secured total funding package of £180m in January 2016, comprising £80m from the equity placing, alongside £100m in committed debt facilities. As at 31 December 2016, the Group had drawn £59.8m of its £100.0m debt facilities. The Group added £75.5m in new initial contract value, up +255%, reflecting growth from both organic and through acquisition of network asset from KCOM in January 2016 and Redcentric in September 2016. CityFibre’s CEO, Greg Mesch, commented “CityFibre now has significant presence in 42 cities across the UK and the rapid commercialisation of the Group's assets underlines the strong demand for an alternative to BT Openreach at a national level. We continue to see significant levels of demand from both business and public services sectors alongside increasing interest from mobile operators and residential broadband providers. With the regulatory and political landscapes now both favouring alternative fibre investment, CityFibre has never been better placed to capitalise on expanding its existing footprint and a growing number of near term strategic opportunities”. Our view: CityFibre delivered excellent progress during the FY2016. The revenue growth was driven by the ongoing expansion in footprint, incremental revenues from both existing and new cities, and through the acquisition of network asset from the KCOM and Redcentric. Such transformational acquisition, according to the management, has accelerated its original business plan by up to 7 years. These are reflected in more than doubling of new initial contract value to £75.5m (up +255%), addition of 29 new cities and increased service provider partner base to 54. Organic revenue grew was also strong, increased by +63% to £10.4m, which had a greater contribution from the Edinburgh project that has been completed during the year. Looking ahead, the Group said current trading is in line with management's expectations and that it remain confident to offers a powerful platform for large-scale expansion into both FTTT and FTTH over the longer term. Facilitating current work programmes suggests net debt will continue to rise sharply over the next two years, possibly approaching the Group’s current market capitalisation by 2019E, but by this time annual revenues should have spiked up to around £50m, according to Beaufort estimates. Having delivered first positive adjusted EBITDA of £2.5m in FY2016, a figure three times as large might be expected for the FY2017, following which a first modest net profit is being targeted. Recurring, relatively low maintenance business with sticky customers provides excellent forward visibility. Assuming revenues rise to some £90m within 5 years, which should be capable of producing a 60% EBITDA margin, DCF methodology suggests a current value closer to 75p/share. Beaufort retains its Speculative Buy recommendation on CityFibre.

The Pampers Preemie Protection Size P3 is three sizes smaller than a regular newborn nappy and is suitable for babies weighing less than 1.8lb (800g). The nappy brand will be donating three million of its smallest nappies to UK hospitals’ neonatal units so every premature baby born has access to free nappies. Pampers is partnering with Bliss, a UK charity for babies born premature or sick, to get the nappies to the babies that need them. “The happy and healthy development of every baby, including the tiniest little fighters, is our priority,” said Ian Morley, commercial director at P&G, the company that owns Pampers. “That is why when nurses asked us to design a nappy for the most vulnerable babies, we rose to the challenge.” Pampers The new Pampers Preemie Protection nappies are designed to minimise disruption to help with sleep, positioning and medical care for premature babies. Regular newborn nappies used by neonatal nurses have a wide core that can push a premature baby’s legs apart, not allowing the baby’s hips and legs to rest comfortably, which can disrupt healthy growth and development. Morley said it took the company three years and more than 10,000 hours of research to develop the new P3 nappy. “As a parent of two preemies myself, I am extremely proud that we have created a nappy which meets the very unique needs of premature babies and those that care for them,” he said. Pampers Caroline Lee-Davey, CEO of Bliss, said: “We were thrilled to hear about the new range of Pampers nappies for premature babies, which will make a real difference to the lives of babies and those that care for them. “Caring for such a small and fragile baby can be daunting, but Bliss knows that getting families more actively involved in caring for their premature baby aids development, creates valuable bonding time and helps babies get better faster. “The nappy change is one way parents can take a lead and nappies that are fit for purpose will make this so much easier.” Neo-natal nurse and developmental specialist Cherry Bond explained that premature babies have very unique requirements, which need to be “valued and considered” in every element of their care. “The nappies that are currently available do not fit the smallest babies properly so are often cut and folded to size, which can cause discomfort and impede optimal development,” she said. Pampers is initially partnering with a limited number of hospitals across the country, before rolling out the preemie nappies nationwide to all UK hospitals from this summer. The brand is also asking all parents to share photos of their children with a clenched fist on social media, to celebrate the amazing fighting spirit that premature babies show every day. Pampers will be donating £1 to Bliss for every picture shared using #powerofbabies.  Pampers Preemie Protection nappies are available in sizes P1 (<5lb/2.7kg), P2 (<4lb/1.8kg) and P3 (<1.8lb/0.8kg).

Many of us would be happy enough with this distinction, but Trushar doesn’t quite believe he’s at the height of success yet. He has a favourite quote: “Entrepreneurship is like living a few years of your life like most people won’t so that you can spend the rest of your life like most people can’t”. He says he is currently between the first and last part of that quote. Trushar has an easy smile for whoever he is talking to and a manner about him that would make you forget how successful he has been as an entrepreneur. At 29, he was named by Forbes Africa as one of 2016’s top 30 under 30 most promising entrepreneurs in Africa, despite his having launched his first business just three years earlier. Trushar is the founder and chief executive of Tria Group and Tria Transit Media, which deals with out-of-home advertising. He also runs a chain of supermarkets as the founder and CEO of Society Stores, which has six outlets countrywide From scratch Aside from retail and advertising, he is passionate about music and hopes he can go back to regular dee-jaying like he did when he was younger. Still, he tries to find ways to do it in the midst of his busy schedule. “I have been able to play for artistes like Jua Kali, Kleptomaniacs, Wyre and Bahati,” says Trushar. “Every time I’m opening one of my retail outlets, I have one of these artists perform. Bahati performed recently for my Limuru store, which opened in December.” Trushar comes from an enterprising family, but that mattered little when he decided to go into business. “I chose to leave our family business (Khetia Supermarkets) in Kitale and came to Nairobi to start from scratch. I started Tria with my savings from the places I had worked before, including Procter & Gamble in the UK, plus clients that I had already closed. I was able to sell my idea to people who got on board and became my clients before I started,” he says. “I attribute what I learnt about retail to having come from a family that was in the business, but when it comes to starting up these companies, getting them to where they are, I have done that by myself, independently.” Trushar founded Tria Group in 2012 with Sh5 million, and it launched Tria Transit Media as its first venture. The business focuses on advertising via public transport. “I believe the best form of outdoor media should be on-the-move media. In transit, you get a captive audience. These are guys who are stuck in buses and at bus stops. Our tagline is: We don’t wait for people to come to our message; we take our message to people,” he says. The media company became a runaway success in just one year, but its advertising model was soon encroached upon by copycats. “They were doing the same thing but in a shoddy and haphazard way and this started devaluing the market. They were undercutting, and sometimes it was because they were briefcase companies – an individual with no overheads, just a contract.” Tria decided to diversify while staying true to the idea of captive audiences and started turning informal bus stages, where people had no shelter, into formal shelters with adverts on them. The company added advertising in malls, supermarkets and experiential media, where consumers experience the brand. And last week, Tria unveiled a partnership with Jambojet, expanding advertising to planes. The exclusive deal will allow Tria to advertise its clients’ brands on all in-plane options, including beverage cups, napkins, luggage compartments, menu cards, table trays and headrest covers. “We are proud to say that together with Jambojet, we are the first in Kenya to do something like in-plane ads. It has been a journey, and we consider this as Tria’s biggest achievement so far,” Trushar says. Dealing with failure Tria funded the launch of Society Stores at a cost of Sh20 million. “Instead of the money coming back to me, which is what we call short-term gratification, I used the funds to buy a supermarket. I bought out an existing business in Thika in November 2014,” says Trushar. Forbes records the store as having had a turnover of Sh1.4 billion in 2015. But Trushar still thinks he has more ground to cover. “For me, success is a journey rather than a destination. It never comes to an end. The pursuit of success is continuous. The fact that you keep at it is what makes you successful. “Maybe the day I choose to retire is the day I’ll say I have made it. I wouldn’t say I would ever completely not be in business, but making it would probably mean my business can run without my presence. Right now, if I am not there for two or three days, things start going wrong because we are still very young.” And though all seems to be going well, Trushar says he is familiar with failure, and has embraced it. “I fail every day at least in one thing – maybe I overlook or ignore something. But that is OK because that is how I learn. That makes me better, stronger and faster for the next thing. Failure goes hand in hand with success. “The difference between those who make it and those who don’t is whether one decides to quit or not. Plus, I am willing to admit my mistakes and change very quickly.” Indulge a little As for how far he has come, Trushar says it is all about his passion, drive and dedication to what he does. “I am very consistent. As much as I have been knocked down, I never give up. A lot of times I feel like giving up and feel like it is getting too tough, but the fact that I do not is what I attribute to where I am. I tell myself, ‘don’t forget where you started and where you want to go’. I remind myself why I got into this in the first place.” Despite having had to sacrifice at first to build Tria and then Society Stores with Tria’s profits, Trushar can now afford to live a little and indulge his love for cars. His two main cars are a red BMW Z4, a convertible two-seater, and a Jaguar XF. “I use the Z4 for the weekends because it is a really low car and there can only be two people in it. During weekdays, I use the Jaguar. I love my cars and, hopefully, I will grow that collection,” says Trushar. He is, however, determined to not get too attached to things. “Sometimes I joke around with my dad and when I am taking very big risks he says I am really pushing it. But I tell him that it is ok, because even if I lose it all, I will not lose myself and I can rebuild. As long as you do not lose yourself, then you have lost nothing. Everything else is materialistic.” RELATED TOPICS: Forbes Africa Trushar Khetia Tria Group Tria Transit Media SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Do you have something to add to this story?

provided by Pampers UK 25 Apr, 2017, 19:01 ET Share this article LONDON, April 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Pampers has developed its smallest nappy yet, the Pampers Preemie Protection Size P3. Designed specifically to meet the needs of the tiniest little fighters, the Size P3 nappy is three sizes smaller than a regular newborn nappy and is suitable for babies weighing smaller than 1.8lb (800g). Pampers is demonstrating its continued commitment to the happy, healthy development of every baby in the UK, including those born prematurely, by donating three million[1] of its smallest nappies to UK hospitals' Neonatal Units, giving every premature baby born access to free nappies. UK's smallest nappy for babies weighing less than 1.8lb (PRNewsfoto/Pampers UK)      (Photo: http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/493893/Pampers_UK.jpg ) Approximately one in 11 babies (60,000)[2] are born prematurely in the UK each year and due to advances in medical science, survival rates of these little fighters are increasing[3]. Neo-natal nurse and developmental specialist Cherry Bond said "Premature babies have very unique requirements, which need to be valued and considered in every element of their care; the right nappy is no exception. The nappies that are currently available do not fit the smallest babies properly so are often cut and folded to size, which can cause discomfort and impede optimal development". That's why Pampers has designed a range of nappies specifically to meet the needs of premature babies, and is donating them to hospitals. Pampers is partnering with the UK's leading charity for babies born premature or sick, Bliss to get the nappies to the babies that need them, initially partnering with a limited number of hospitals across the country, before rolling out nationwide to all UK hospitals from summer 2017. The brand is also asking all parents to share photos of their little ones with a clenched fist on social media, to celebrate the amazing fighting spirit that premature babies show every day, and will be donating £1 to the charity for every picture shared using #powerofbabies. Together Pampers and Bliss aim to support the littlest fighters in the Neonatal Unit and those who care for them. Caroline Lee-Davey, CEO of Bliss said, "We were thrilled to hear about the new range of Pampers nappies for premature babies, which will make a real difference to the lives of babies and those that care for them. Caring for such a small and fragile baby can be daunting, but Bliss knows that getting families more actively involved in caring for their premature baby aids development, creates valuable bonding time and helps babies get better faster. The nappy change is one way parents can take a lead and nappies that are fit for purpose will make this so much easier." New Pampers Preemie Protection nappies are designed to minimise disruption to help with sleep, positioning, and medical care for premature babies. Regular newborn nappies currently used by Neonatal nurses have a wide core that can push baby's legs apart, not allowing baby's hips and legs to rest comfortably, which 99% of nurses agree disrupts healthy growth and development[4]. The happy and healthy development of every baby, including the tiniest little fighters, is our priority, that is why when nurses asked us to design a nappy for the most vulnerable babies, we rose to the challenge" said Ian Morley, Commercial Director at P&G. "It took us three years and over 10,000 hours of research to develop the new P3 nappy, which is designed to provide comfort and protection for the smallest babies. As a parent of two preemies myself, I am extremely proud that we have created a nappy which meets the very unique needs of premature babies and those that care for them". Pampers Preemie Protection nappies are available in sizes P1 (<5lb/ 2.7kg) and P2 (<4lb/ 1.8kg) and P3 (<1.8lb/ 0.8kg) and will start to be donated to hospitals from Summer 2017.

Designed specifically to meet the needs of the tiniest little fighters, the Size P3 nappy is three sizes smaller than a regular newborn nappy and is suitable for babies weighing smaller than 1.8lb (800g). Pampers is demonstrating its continued commitment to the happy, healthy development of every baby in the UK, including those born prematurely, by donating three million[1] of its smallest nappies to UK hospitals’ Neonatal Units, giving every premature baby born access to free nappies.      (Photo: http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/493893/Pampers_UK.jpg ) Approximately one in 11 babies (60,000)[2] are born prematurely in the UK each year and due to advances in medical science, survival rates of these little fighters are increasing[3]. Neo-natal nurse and developmental specialist Cherry Bond said “Premature babies have very unique requirements, which need to be valued and considered in every element of their care; the right nappy is no exception. The nappies that are currently available do not fit the smallest babies properly so are often cut and folded to size, which can cause discomfort and impede optimal development“. That’s why Pampers has designed a range of nappies specifically to meet the needs of premature babies, and is donating them to hospitals. Pampers is partnering with the UK’s leading charity for babies born premature or sick, Bliss to get the nappies to the babies that need them, initially partnering with a limited number of hospitals across the country, before rolling out nationwide to all UK hospitals from summer 2017. The brand is also asking all parents to share photos of their little ones with a clenched fist on social media, to celebrate the amazing fighting spirit that premature babies show every day, and will be donating £1 to the charity for every picture shared using #powerofbabies. Together Pampers and Bliss aim to support the littlest fighters in the Neonatal Unit and those who care for them. Caroline Lee-Davey, CEO of Bliss said, “We were thrilled to hear about the new range of Pampers nappies for premature babies, which will make a real difference to the lives of babies and those that care for them. Caring for such a small and fragile baby can be daunting, but Bliss knows that getting families more actively involved in caring for their premature baby aids development, creates valuable bonding time and helps babies get better faster. The nappy change is one way parents can take a lead and nappies that are fit for purpose will make this so much easier.“ New Pampers Preemie Protection nappies are designed to minimise disruption to help with sleep, positioning, and medical care for premature babies.

The disappointment was palpable on a lack of specifics after months of teasing from the White House. Stocks have gained trillions in market cap value in anticipation of Trump’s proposed pro-business legislation, of which, none have proceeded through the House of Representatives. As a result, patience is wearing thin. In the end, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1%, the S&P 500 lost 0.1%, the Nasdaq lost a fraction and the Russell 2000 gained 0.6%. Treasury bonds were mostly stronger, the dollar gained against the euro, gold lost 0.2% and crude oil gained 0.1% after mixed inventory data (crude stockpiles saw a large draw while gasoline stocks posted a big build). Breadth was modestly positive, up with 1.4 advancers for every decliner on the NYSE. Volume was heavy again, at 117% of the 30-day average. Defensive telecom stocks rebounded, up 1.2% to lead the way. REITs were the laggards, down 0.9%. Twitter Inc (NYSE:TWTR) gained 7.9% after a big first-quarter earnings and revenue beat on strong user metrics, with monthly active users up nine million while daily active users increased 14% from last year for the fourth straight quarter of acceleration. Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) gained 5.9% on a big operating earnings beat thank to a upside at both Macau and Las Vegas properties on share gains. And Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) gained 2.4% on an earnings beat driven by a 17.8% rise in comp-store sales vs. the 14.9% gain expected. On the downside, United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) was slammed 26.8% on a big quarterly earnings miss on a drag from flat rolled steel sales and higher material costs. Forward guidance was lowered. Hard drive maker Seagate Technology PLC (NASDAQ:STX) fell 16.8% on a revenue miss and bloated inventories for this time of the year. And Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) fell 2.5% after reporting an earnings beat that was clouded by weak organic revenue growth and tepid guidance. Turning back to Trump, his tax plan follows these broad outlines: Simplified system with fewer brackets, a doubling of the standard deduction, a 15% business tax rate that would apply to smaller “pass through” entities, elimination of the “death tax” and alternative minimum tax, and the elimination of all deductions save mortgage interest and charitable gifts. Specifics still need to be hashed out with members of Congress. There was also action on trade, with Politico reporting that Trump is preparing an executive order to withdraw from the NAFTA free-trade pact with Canada and Mexico. And there is ongoing chatter about renewed progress on health care reform. The market seems remarkably unconcerned about a possible government shutdown on Friday, with expectations high for a temporary funding bill that gives Republicans and Democrats a few more weeks to hash the budget out. For now, with technical measures overextended, breadth narrow, and sentiment still red hot, the risk-reward relationships seems biased to the downside. As result, I am recommending new defensive positions such as the May $16 calls in the Short Term VIX (NYSEARCA:VXX) that are up more than 20% for Edge Pro subscribers.

Mobile Get alerts for the latest Magic, Knights, Gators, Seminoles and soccer news Sports NFL, Pro Bowl, Super Bowl Commentary: Steve Spurrier remembers being 1st QB taken in NFL Draft 50 years ago Steve Spurrier was a star player and coach, putting Florida Gators football on the map. Take a look back at moments throughout his football career. Spurrier was the Head Ball Coach at South Carolina until he retired Monday.  Mike BianchiContact ReporterOrlando Sentinel Steve Spurrier didn’t have an agent, never talked to the team that picked him and was interviewed by a legendary trumpet player 50 years ago when he was the first quarterback taken in the 1967 NFL Draft. “The NFL Draft was no big deal back then,” Spurrier recalls a half-century after being taken third overall by the San Francisco 49ers. Amazingly, Spurrier was drafted not to be a starting quarterback but to be a backup behind All-Pro QB John Brodie, who had just signed a huge contract and was one of the best passers in NFL history. Spurrier’s most significant contribution during his first few seasons in the league was as San Francisco’s punter and as Brodie’s golfing buddy. He started just six games in his first five years in the league. “Back then, the attitude among many NFL teams was we’ll bring a guy in and four or five years later he’ll be ready to play quarterback,” Spurrier says. “That’s pretty much what they told me, ‘You’ll sit behind Brodie for four or five years and then you’ll be ready to go.’ ” Can you imagine if the Carolina Panthers, picking eighth in tonight’s draft, chose Clemson quarterback Deshaun Watson to sit behind Cam Newton for the next five years? Twitter would explode, Mel Kiper’s hair would catch on fire and Carolina fans would scream for GM Dave Gettleman to be fired for not “filling a need” and drafting Stanford running back Christian McCaffrey. 2017 NFL draft order The Cleveland Browns will kick off the 2017 NFL draft with the first pick.

In 1967, there was no NFL Combine, no Wonderlic Test, no months-long preparation for the draft. In those days, the draft was held in mid-March and consisted of a bunch of grizzled NFL scouts sitting around in a smoky hotel ballroom as their picks were recorded on a centrally located chalkboard. TV networks didn’t provide wire-to-wire coverage, fans didn’t pay attention and the media gave it cursory coverage. On the day after the ’67 draft, there was only one story in the Orlando Sentinel and sports editor Bob Bassine chose to write a spring training column on the Mets rather than a column on Spurrier being taken by the 49ers. Orlando Sentinel Sports front page in 1967, the day after Steve Spurrier was drafted by the 49ers Sentinel File Orlando Sentinel Sports front page in 1967, the day after Steve Spurrier was drafted by the 49ers Orlando Sentinel Sports front page in 1967, the day after Steve Spurrier was drafted by the 49ers (Sentinel File) Not even the players back then knew or cared much about the draft process. Sports Illustrated writer Don Banks did an excellent retrospective on the 1967 draft recently in which he talked to Miami Dolphins legend Bob Griese, the Purdue quarterback who finished second to Spurrier in the Heisman voting and was taken one spot behind Spurrier in that draft 50 years ago. “It was the spring of my senior year, and I’m going to graduate soon,” Griese recalled in the SI retrospective. “I think I had a job interview scheduled with some company that had come to campus. I majored in industrial management, so I’m thinking I’ll go to work for Johnson & Johnson or Procter & Gamble, some company like that. “The way I found out I was drafted was my offensive/quarterback coach, Bob DeMoss, saw me in the hallway as we were passing, like we had done a million times, and he kind of looked down at me and said, ‘Hey, congratulations. I hear you’re going to Miami.’ Just like that. I mean, nobody called me. The Dolphins didn’t call me. The NFL didn’t call. The writers, the media, nobody called me. I said, well, all right, I guess I’ll go down there and play for a little while, three or four years, and then get on with my life’s work. “When I was taken fourth by the Dolphins, I kidded (Miami general manager) Joe Thomas after the draft. I said ‘You’re the Miami Dolphins in Florida and Steve Spurrier just won the Heisman a few miles north of here. It’s a damn good thing for you that San Francisco drafted him or you would have had to take Spurrier.’ He was like, ‘Oh, no, no. I knew I wanted you all along.’ He said even if Steve Spurrier was available I was still going to take you. I said ‘Yeah, sure, you’re full of it.’” Mike Bianchi does impression of Steve Spurrier quips Sports Columnist Mike Bianchi does his impression of Steve Spurrier's famous quips. Sports Columnist Mike Bianchi does his impression of Steve Spurrier's famous quips. See more videos Spurrier told me Wednesday he never even had a conversation with the 49ers before draft day. In fact, one of the only team reps he talked to before the draft was iconic trumpet player Al Hirt, who was a minority owner of the expansion New Orleans Saints. “He was playing a concert in Gainesville and he wanted to tell me all about the new team in New Orleans,” Spurrier recalls. On draft day, Spurrier had nothing better to do so he decided to head down to the office of Gainesville attorney Bill O’Neal to hang out. O’Neal was a forerunner to a modern-day sports agent. He represented many UF athletes back then although Spurrier says, “he didn’t charge us anything.” Spurrier got a $25,000 signing bonus from the 49ers and signed a four-year deal that paid him about $34,000 annually. “There was no union back then,” Spurrier recalls. “I still remember back in 1969 or so (when the NFL Players Association was being organized), the union gathered us all together and said, ‘Fellas, one day, in about 15 or 20 years, players will actually make $400,000 per year.’ We all looked around and said, ‘Ain’t no way anybody is going to pay us $400,000 a year to play football. “Little did we know that there would be a day when players would be making $25 million per year.” Steve Spurrier, the first quarterback taken in an NFL Draft a half-century ago, laughs. “Times have changed a little bit, haven’t they?” Email me at mbianchi@orlandosentinel.com.

The major averages pulled back going into the close, ending the session just below the unchanged line. The Dow dipped 21.03 points or 0.1 percent to 20,975.09, the Nasdaq edged down 0.27 points or less than a tenth of a percent to 6,025.23 and the S&P 500 slipped 1.16 points or 0.1 percent to 2,387.45. The lower close on Wall Street came after officials from President Donald Trump's administration unveiled the president's highly anticipated tax reform plan. White House chief economic adviser Gary Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin outlined Trump's plan in a briefing to reporters at the White House. Trump's tax reform plan would reduce the number of income tax brackets from seven to three, with a top rate of 35 percent and lower rates of 25 percent and 10 percent. The president's proposal would also lower the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from the current 35 percent. Trump's plan would also eliminate the alternative minimum tax as well as the estate tax, which is also known as the "death tax." Among individual stocks, shares of Twitter (TWTR) moved sharply higher after the social media giant reported better than expected first quarter results. Restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) also saw notable strength after reporting first quarter results that exceeded analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Boeing (BA) also reported first quarter earnings that exceeded analyst estimates, although the aerospace giant reported revenues that came in below expectations. Consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (PG) also reported better than expected third quarter earnings on weaker than expected revenues. Shares of U.S. Steel (X) came under pressure after the steel giant reported a wider than expected first quarter loss on weaker than expected revenues. In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region extended a recent upward move during trading on Wednesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index surged up by 1.1 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index advanced by 0.5 percent. The major European markets also moved to the upside on the day. While the German DAX Index inched up by 0.1 percent, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index and the French CAC 40 Index both edged up by 0.2 percent. In the bond market, treasuries ended the session modestly higher after trending lower in recent sessions. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, slipped by 1.6 basis points to 2.311 percent. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Giraffes On The Savannah: Africa's 10 Tallest Skyscrapers The 10 Biggest Imports in the USA Friendly Skies: Best Airlines for Customer Satisfaction Previous Story Next Story More Top Stories European Shares Seen Lower On Trump Tax-plan Disappointment Samsung Q1 Profit Climbs, Sees Higher Earnings Ahead; Stock Up Asian Markets Mostly Lower Amid Cautious Trades Gainers & Losers Of Apr.26: AKBA, FLKS, BIOL, BABY, FLXN...

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 26 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Global Fatty Amines Market on Track to Reach US$ 2 Billion in 2020 : Persistence Market Research New York City, NY — (SBWIRE) — 04/26/2017 — Applications in several end-use industries will continue to fuel the market for fatty amines globally. By 2016 end, the global fatty amines market is estimated at US$ 1,855.3 Mn. Developing countries in Asia-Pacific will remain the key markets for fatty amines, whereas applications in water treatment and agro-chemical industries will continue to generate significant demand for fatty amines. Sample of this report is available upon request @ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/12913 Corrosion inhibition, fabric softening, lubricant additive, organoclaying, and sanitization are some of the most popular applications, which are expected to sustain the demand for fatty acids in a market. A few other prominent applications, including mining, water treatment, personal care, anti-caking, oilfield chemicals, paints and coatings, and agro-chemicals, are also likely to register significant consumption. Rising global population resulting in increasing demand for food products is eventually driving the market for asphalt-additives and agro-chemicals. Similarly, growing need for water treatment will be a major factor propelling the market for water treatment chemicals, and in turn escalating the sales of fatty amines. The advent of technology and new application development will be a vital factor favoring the market growth. Mining, paints and coatings, fabric conditioning, and detergents, are foreseen to be the major verticals recording notable consumption of fatty acids. Industries associated with the paints and coatings vertical, such as automotive and construction, are foreseen to be among the prominent consumers of fatty amines. The volatility of the prices of raw materials and uncertainty of the fatty amines availability may, however, continue to create unfavorable conditions for the global fatty amines market growth. By product type, the global fatty amines market will witness continued dominance by the tertiary fatty amines segment. With the largest market value share of over 47% by 2016 end, this segment may experience a slight decline in its market share post-2016. Primary fatty amines segment, with over 29% revenue share in 2016, is likely to witness a Y-o-Y of 4.9% in 2017 over 2016. Based on application, water treatment segment is anticipated to lead the global fatty amines market. Agro-chemicals will also be another key segment, followed by asphalt-additives. Oilfield chemicals segment will also remain a notable application segment. Other application segments include anti-caking and others i.e. mining, personal care, and fabric softener. By region, APAC is likely to remain dominant with nearly 30% market value share in 2016. In 2017, this region will witness moderate Y-o-Y growth of 4.2% over 2016. The next key market is North America that is expected to exhibit a higher Y-o-Y of 6.3% in 2017 over 2016. Request to view Table of Content @ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/market-research/fatty-amines-market/toc DuPont, Kao Corporation, AkzoNobel N.V., Clariant AG, Evonik Industries AG, Procter & Gamble Chemicals Company, Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, CECA Arkema Group, Lonza, and Volant-Chem Group are some of the leading companies participating in the global fatty amines market. To Buy Full Report for a Single User @ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/checkout/12913 Long-term Outlook: The global fatty amines market is projected to attain a value of around US$ 2,193.2 Mn by the end of 2020, expanding at a CAGR of 4.1% over 2016-2020.

US stocks dip as Trump releases tax overhaul plan Money Wednesday 26 April 2017 - 11:13pm FILE: Procter & Gamble lost 2.5 percent after it revealed declines in sales and profits, saying challenging geopolitical and economic conditions hit consumer demand. Photo: DANIEL ROLAND / AFP NEW YORK - Wall Street stocks finished slightly lower Wednesday following mixed earnings and after the White House unveiled details of its long-awaited tax reform plan. Tax cuts have been Wall Street's top priority since the election of President Donald Trump. But analysts characterised the muted reaction to the announcement as a pullback after a strong rally the last two days. "We got a big run up in the past few days as details of the tax plan had been leaked out and there was a bit of modest selling on the news," said Alan Skrainka, chief investment officer at Cornerstone Wealth Management.

It was only the second time in 21 quarters the company disappointed expectations. Procter & Gamble lost 2.5 percent after it revealed declines in sales and profits, saying challenging geopolitical and economic conditions hit consumer demand. US Steel plunged 26.7 percent after reporting a loss of $180 million in the first quarter and slashing its forecast for full-year earnings to $260 million from the prior $535 million.   Twitter surged 7.9 percent as monthly active users grew nine percent from the same period a year ago to 328 million.

How big did President Trump go in his tax cut proposal? Did the Boston City Council take $153 million and run? What on-screen personalities are out at ESPN? For the answers to these questions, Jon Chesto on iRobot, and a chance to nominate your company as a top place to work, read on. Chesto Means Business Rise of the machines: “It’s a good day for robots.” That’s what iRobot CEO Colin Angle had to say today when we chatted about his company’s latest earnings report -- and it’s hard to argue with him. Shareholders seemed to agree, driving up iRobot’s stock by nearly 15 percent. Revenue at the maker of Roombas and other robotic cleaners rose nearly 30 percent, and the Bedford company is now on track to clear the $1 billion mark within the next three years. There was no guarantee that things would go this way for Angle and his robot army a year ago. That’s when the iRobot board was deep in a bruising proxy battle with an activist shareholder who showed up after the stock languished for roughly two years. Angle’s side won. But the fight cost iRobot time and money. He shouldn’t need to worry about another activist rattling his cage: iRobot’s shares have more than doubled in value since the proxy fight ended last May. Angle’s success has broader repercussions. Robots are widespread in manufacturing plants, but are still not common home appliances. However, iRobot is a bellwether company for the robotics sector, and its ability to attract a growing number of consumers into the fold is bound to be noticed by investors and money managers. These intelligent machines have been “the next big thing” for decades. But the surge in sales of autonomous vacuums is a signal that they are finally entering the mainstream. It’s a good day for robots. Jon Chesto is a Globe reporter. Reach him at jon.chesto@globe.com and follow him on Twitter @jonchesto. Executive Summary Advertisement Trump rolls out "biggest tax cut": President Donald Trump is calling for deep cuts in business taxes and reductions personal tax rates. Here's a quick summary of what was announced today: The top personal tax rate would fall to 35 percent from 39.6 percent. Lower rates would be 10 percent and 15 percent The standard deduction for married couples doubles to $24,000, and mortgage and charitable deductions remain in place. Gone are the estate tax, the alternative minimum tax, and the tax supporting Obamacare. Corporate taxes drop to 15 percent from 35 percent. Business income reported on individual returns would be taxed at 15 percent, not at that individual's tax rate.  The Globe's Evan Horowitz has a breaksdown in this  article of the main criticisms of the Trump proposal. They include that the tax cuts will increase the deficit. Also, a proposed tax cut for small businesses is open to abuse. Made in the shade: As expected, the Boston City Council voted today in favor of changing a state law curtailing skyscraper shadows reaching the Boston Common and Public Garden. The council voted 10-3. Voting against the measure were Tito Jackson, who is running for mayor, Council President Michelle Wu, and district Councilor Josh Zakim.  By changing the law, Millenium Partners can move forward with a planned 775-foot skyscaper above the old Winthrop Square garage. In return, the city receives $153 million toward parks and public housing. The city's home rule petition ultimately requires the Legislature's approval. Partners' target slimming down: A Providence-based hospital that agreed to a merger with Partners Health Care is laying off workers. Care New England, Rhode Island's second-largest health care system, said it laid off workers, but declined to say how many people lost their jobs. Care New England agreed last week to be acquired by Partners. The spokesman acknowledged there were layoffs at three facilities that were part of the Partners' deal: Women & Infants Hospital in Providence, Kent Hospital in Warwick, and Butler Hospital in Providence. State Street earnings up: State Street attributed a rise in first quarter profits to the "Fearless Girl" statute it placed on Wall Street. Ok, let's back up. The sculpture, "Fearless Girl," was placed facing the familiar bull on Wall Street. It represented a new exchange traded fund State Street Global Advisors manages (called SHE) that favors stocks of companies with women in charge. Now, back to the present. State Street's quarterly earnings were up $446 million, about 40 percent from a year ago. State Street chief Jay Hooley attributed the rise in part to ETFs, including the SHE fund. Fish school legacy: Suffolk Construction magnate John Fish isn't building the Olympic stadiums of his dreams . But a scholarship fund financed by Suffolk is fulfilling the college aspirations of Bay State students. East Boston soccer star Yesica Calderon has won a full-tuition scholarship to Regis College, courtesy of Scholar Athletes. Scholar Athletes is a nonprofitcreated by Suffolk in 2009 to support academic achievement by athletes. It reaches nearly 5,000 Boston and Springfield students by providing "zones" where student-athletes can receive mentoring, tutoring, and help with college applications.  Calderon spent hours in the zone and graduated with a 4.8 grade point average. She'll be the first in her family to attend college. Trending Pick O'Hare unlucky for giant rabbit: United Airlines is facing another test of its PR skills. With memories still fresh of a man dragged off of a plane in Chicago, there's word that a three-foot long rabbit died on one of its flights.The continental giant rabbit was healthy when it boarded, but was found dead when the plane landed in Chicago. In 2015, 35 animals died in transit on airlines in the US. Of those, 14 were on United flights. Line Items Get Today's Headlines in your inbox: The day's top stories delivered every morning.

At the top of the financial crisis, Bain acquired some $10 billion in loans dumped at a discount by damaged European banks. In Ireland, that portfolio included loans to 66 pubs and about 36 hotels.   Bain got its opening in Ireland when entrenched lenders like Anglo Irish Bank and Ulster Bank retreated from the island republic to clean up their balance sheets. Now, Bain is expanding, looking to finance more than 1,000 housing units in Ireland. It created Broadhaven Capital Partners to make new loans to fund commercial development, such as Maplewood, 23 luxury homes with a view of Dublin harbor.   Still, real estate development is expected to remain a sideline, as Bain Capital focuses the next few years on buying loans from European banks looking to get out of troubled portfolios.

By Minneapolis Star Tribune Apr 24, 2017 at 3:36 pm | Print View MINNEAPOLIS — Target saw the writing on the fogged-up bathroom mirror. Its sales of men’s razors and blades, one of the biggest categories in its beauty and personal care aisles, had begun to slip as a number of upstart online brands were disrupting the industry and going straight to consumers, bypassing stores altogether. Its solution? The Minneapolis-based retailer joined forces with them. In the past year, Target has partnered with two subscription-based online brands — Harry’s and Bevel — brokering exclusive deals to be the only mass retailer to carry their products. “It’s been really working so far — knock on wood,” said John Butcher, Target’s senior vice president of beauty merchandising. Target’s market share in men’s shaving has jumped by double digits, as has its overall sales of men’s razors, he said. About 50 percent of Target’s razor handle sales and about 15 percent of its cartridges now come from Harry’s. And unlike what some expected, it hasn’t necessarily come at the expense of the longtime king of the razor aisle — Procter & Gamble’s Gillette. Gillette’s sales at Target have also been up, despite losing a bit of shelf space as Target cleaned up the product presentation, Butcher said. “There were some skeptics out there,” he said. “But the hypothesis was if we become a more meaningful destination for men’s shave, then we get more people in the aisle. And that affords everybody in the aisle the opportunity to win more business at Target. That’s exactly what’s happening.” Like what you're reading?

The Dow Jones industrial average turned lower about 20 minutes before the close, with United Technologies contributing the most gains and Procter & Gamble the most losses. The 30-stock index was about 1 percent away from its all-time high of 21,169.11, however. The S&P 500 also turned lower, with real estate leading decliners.

Dental floss is essentially a thread, which removes food trapped between teeth and removes the film of bacteria that forms there before it has a chance to harden into plaque. The increased interest among consumers in adopting preventive healthcare measures is one of the key driving factors of the global dental floss market. Technavio’s research study segments the global dental floss market into the following regions: Americas EMEA APAC Dental floss market in the Americas “The Americas dominated the dental floss market in 2016, holding close to 50% of the overall shares. The market dominance is set to continue, owing to increased dentist recommendations and increased attention towards oral hygiene,” says Krishna Venkataramani, a lead analyst at Technavio for health and wellness research. The dominance of the Americas is majorly due to the high awareness and accessibility of the dental floss in countries such as the US. Furthermore, with the rise in disposable income, the demand for improved oral care products like mouthwash, dental floss, denture care, and whitening strips have increased.

Dental floss market in EMEA The dental floss market in EMEA is projected to be worth USD 1009.22 million by 2021, driven by the growing awareness among consumers regarding the importance and benefits of flossing. Also, dental regulatory bodies such as National Health Service (NHS), British Dental Association (BDA), and European Federation of Periodontology (EFP) are recommending dental floss in national health policies as an effective measure for not just good oral health but overall general well-being. Also, the largely untapped markets in the Middle East and Africa pose a huge opportunity for vendors to run successful marketing campaigns and increase their shares. Dental floss market in APAC “The dental floss market in APAC is one of the fastest-growing segments of the global market. India and China are lucrative markets for the vendors, with high economic growth, changing lifestyles, and increased spending driving the market growth,” says Krishna. The APAC market is being aggressively pursued by leading vendors as hotspots to increase awareness surrounding the importance of oral health, thereby increasing the revenue generated from the regional segment. Increasing awareness regarding oral hygiene and increasing disposable income are also some of the drivers in this region. The top vendors in the global dental floss market highlighted in the report are: Procter & Gamble Colgate-Palmolive Johnson & Johnson Sunstar Suisse Browse Related Reports: Global Tattoo Removal Market 2017-2021 Global Clinical Mobility Aids Market 2017-2021 Global Sexual Enhancement Supplements Market 2017-2021 Become a Technavio Insights member and access all three of these reports for a fraction of their original cost.

Done Editing Tags 20 Comments Share this article 46 46 46 Since Congress won’t pass paid sick leave or paid family leave laws—thanks, Republicans!—many states and cities have started taking action to make sure their workers have those protections. But now big business sees its chance and is lobbying congressional Republicans to protect it from all those state and local laws. Josh Eidelson reports that, while Donald Trump campaigned on the claim that he supported paid family leave: Now big business is countering the calls with a proposal of its own: Congress should establish a certain optional amount of paid leave and, if companies meet that threshold, they should be protected from state or local laws that might require more. The proposal is part of a report being released Tuesday by the HR Policy Association, a coalition of more than 380 major U.S. companies. Together, the group’s members employ 9 percent of America’s private-sector workers. Executives on the committee behind the report represent companies including Marriott International, Procter & Gamble, IBM, Cigna, General Electric, Wendy’s, Oracle and General Mills. The idea is that Congress sets a floor that’s also a ceiling—a company that gives as much paid leave as the Republican-controlled Congress thinks is enough gets a free pass on city and state laws that require more. The companies say they want this law because it’s just so difficult to keep track of a patchwork of laws … but a federal law requiring a certain amount of paid leave?  That’s not an idea the HR Policy Association has embraced. “I think that probably feels a little too intrusive for our membership,” said Johnna Torsone, executive vice president of Pitney Bowes, who worked on the report and chairs the association’s Employment Rights Committee. Offering a safe harbor, she said, “feels more amenable” to industry leaders. Yeah, “feels more amenable” in the sense of “lets them get away with more.” Which is basically what congressional Republicans are always looking to deliver to big business. 20 Comments Share this article 46 46 46 20 Comments Comment Settings Close Settings Auto refresh Collapse on load Show hidden Show until I hide Comments are closed on this story.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday proposed slashing the US tax rate on corporate and pass-through business profits to 15 percent from 35 percent or more. The administration is determined to get the tax reform done by this year, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at press conference. The promise of a massive tax cut has been at the core of the post-election rally, which has driven Wall Street's indexes to record highs. However, the rally has stalled of late due to a lack of clarity on Trump's policies and the failure of his healthcare reform bill. At 13:48 p.m. ET (1748 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was up 38.02 points, or 0.18 percent, at 21,034.14, the S&P 500 was up 5.06 points, or 0.21 percent, at 2,393.67 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 6.52 points, or 0.11 percent, at 6,032.01. Six of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher. Among stocks, United Technologies rose 1.8 percent and provided the biggest boost to the Dow, after reporting a quarterly profit that beat expectations. On the flip side, Boeing shares fell about 1 percent and weighed on the Dow after the planemaker reported a decline in revenue. Procter & Gamble declined 2 percent after reporting lower quarterly profit. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,859 to 1,036, for a 1.79-to-1 ratio on the upside. On the Nasdaq, 1,790 issues rose and 1,005 fell for a 1.78-to-1 ratio favoring advancers. The S&P 500 index showed 77 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 194 new highs and 19 new lows.     Copyright Reuters, 2017    Twitter Facebook Google+ Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Mail Print the author Shoaib Ur Rehman Siddiqui Previous EU lawmakers call for suspension of Turkey accession talks Next Stocks advance on earnings; Canada dollar, Mexico peso weaken on NAFTA news Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The administration is expected to release details of the plan later on Wednesday, he said.The promise of a massive tax cut has been at the core of the post-election rally, which has driven Wall Street's indexes to record highs. However, the rally has stalled of late due to a lack of clarity on Trump's policies and the failure of his healthcare reform bill. "We think the market is pricing in fairly significant tax relief and that means there is real potential for the tax bill to disappoint," said Matthew Peterson, Chief Wealth Strategist at LPL Financial. "Certainly, the market has room to run, provided that the tax plan is credible and likely passed through Congress." At 12:36 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 55.1 points, or 0.26 percent, at 21,051.22. The S&P 500 .SPX was up 5.23 points, or 0.22 percent, at 2,393.84.

The sector got the biggest boost from Thermo Fisher (TMO.N) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW.N), both of which surged on strong results and upbeat forecasts. United Technologies (UTX.N) rose 1.8 percent and provided the biggest boost to the Dow, after reporting a quarterly profit that beat expectations.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday proposed slashing the U.S. tax rate on corporate and pass-through business profits to 15 percent from 35 percent or more. The administration is determined to get the tax reform done by this year, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at press conference. The promise of a massive tax cut has been at the core of the post-election rally, which has driven Wall Street's indexes to record highs. However, the rally has stalled of late due to a lack of clarity on Trump's policies and the failure of his healthcare reform bill. At 13:48 p.m. ET (1748 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was up 38.02 points, or 0.18 percent, at 21,034.14, the S&P 500 was up 5.06 points, or 0.21 percent, at 2,393.67 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 6.52 points, or 0.11 percent, at 6,032.01. Six of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher. Among stocks, United Technologies rose 1.8 percent and provided the biggest boost to the Dow, after reporting a quarterly profit that beat expectations. On the flip side, Boeing shares fell about 1 percent and weighed on the Dow after the planemaker reported a decline in revenue. Procter & Gamble declined 2 percent after reporting lower quarterly profit. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,859 to 1,036, for a 1.79-to-1 ratio on the upside. On the Nasdaq, 1,790 issues rose and 1,005 fell for a 1.78-to-1 ratio favoring advancers. The S&P 500 index showed 77 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 194 new highs and 19 new lows.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed flat after also giving up earlier gains. "The discussion around the tax plan is a positive for the market," said John Conlon, chief investment officer at People's United Wealth Management. But "I don't think the market is excited; I think it takes some pressure off the market, but there are still questions about some of the details." Top White House officials outlined President Donald Trump's tax plan Wednesday, a proposal they said would be the "biggest tax cut" in U.S. history. The proposal slashes the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent. The White House added there will be a "one-time tax" on the trillions of dollars held by corporations overseas. However, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the rate for that tax has yet to be determined. Expectations for lower corporate taxes have been a boon for stocks ever since Trump was elected in November. Still, the Trump White House has failed to provide specifics on what these tax cuts might look like. It's time for the administration to "go big or go home and a 15% corporate tax rate will certainly make that happen," said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group, in a note to clients. "I'll leave it to others to figure out if and how we get there (will obviously be tough) but the implications will have to also be measured by any change in interest rates in response in gauging the impact on corporate earnings and for other obligations," he said. Trump outlined his tax reform vision ahead of a potential government shutdown. Government funding will end Friday unless Congress can agree on at least a temporary funding resolution. "I think some of the hesitancy in the market has to do with the potential government shutdown later this week," said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. "There's no historical precedent" for a market downturn during a government shutdown, he said. "But because the Trump presidency is different from any we've ever had, there's going to be some hesitancy." Meanwhile, earnings season carried on, with PepsiCo, United Technologies, Procter & Gamble and Twitter all posted a better-than-expected profit. Twitter's stock popped about 12 percent after reporting. This earnings season has shown thus far that Corporate America did very well last quarter. Of the 181 S&P 500 components that had reported as of Wednesday, 77 percent had topped earnings expectations while 67 percent beat on the top line, according to data from The Earnings Scout. "Remember though solid 1Q 2017 results only confirm what has already happened in the markets! 1Q 2017 results should not be used to infer what is going to happen," said Nick Raich, CEO of The Earnings Scout, in a note. "For that information, look to the direction of 2Q 2017 EPS estimate revisions." He said that second-quarter earnings growth expectations have fallen every week this earnings season since March 22. There were no major economic data reports released Wednesday, but Wall Street looked ahead to Friday's first-quarter GDP report. "What concerns me is the Fed is raising rates in a modest economy with earnings growing modestly," said Phil Blancato, CEO of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management. "The rate of change in the economy is changing. The consumer is healthy but not necessarily spending money."

The administration is expected to release details of the plan later on Wednesday, he said.The promise of a massive tax cut has been at the core of the post-election rally, which has driven Wall Street's indexes to record highs. However, the rally has stalled of late due to a lack of clarity on Trump's policies and the failure of his healthcare reform bill. "We think the market is pricing in fairly significant tax relief and that means there is real potential for the tax bill to disappoint," said Matthew Peterson, Chief Wealth Strategist at LPL Financial. "Certainly, the market has room to run, provided that the tax plan is credible and likely passed through Congress." At 10:54 a.m. ET (1454 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 39.58 points, or 0.19 percent, at 21,035.7.

The Nasdaq Composite was up 3.79 points, or 0.06 percent, at 6,029.28, easing from an all-time high of 6,037.21. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by a 0.8 percent gain in energy as oil prices rose. Boeing's shares fell 1.5 percent and weighed the most on the Dow after the planemaker reported a decline in revenue.Procter & Gamble's 2 percent decline was also a drag on the index, after the company's quarterly profit fell. Seagate tumbled nearly 17 percent, dragging down shares of rival Western Digital, after issuing disappointing revenue forecast for the current quarter. Among gainers, Edwards Lifesciences surged 14 percent after it reported strong quarterly revenue and raised its full-year earnings forecast. The stock was the top percentage gainer on the S&P 500.Twitter jumped more than 11 percent after reporting a strong rise in monthly active users and a quarterly profit that blew past expectations. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,847 to 923. On the Nasdaq, 1,595 issues rose and 1,021 fell.The S&P 500 index showed 61 52-week highs and two lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 117 highs and 10 lows.

The surge this week in the Dow DJIA, -0.10% which posted the first back-to-back 200+-point gains since the two days following the U.S. election, is being attributed by many to the reduced risk of euro dissolution in the wake of French election results and hopes for corporate tax cuts and a budget deal. But there is a lot more to it than that. Since April 13, when J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +0.19%  kicked off first-quarter earnings reporting season before the market opened, 15 of the Dow’s 30 components have reported results through Tuesday morning, with 11 beating earnings expectations, according to FactSet. That 73% beat rate is above the 5-year average of 68% for S&P 500 index SPX, -0.05%  companies, FactSet said. More important, the shares of the Dow companies that have revealed results have gained a combined total of $20.69 in price since the reports were released through Tuesday, with 10 winners rising a combined $35.87 and five losers falling $15.01. The combined price gains added about 142 points to the Dow, which is a price-weighted index. That would represent about 35% of the Dow’s 404-point gain since earnings season started. Most of those earnings-related gains have come on Tuesday alone. The stocks of the five Dow companies that reported results added a combined 128 points to the Dow’s price, or more than half of the Dow’s 232-point rally. The biggest contributors were shares of Caterpillar Inc. CAT, +0.23% which added 52 points, and McDonald’s Corp. MCD, -0.61% which added about 51 points.

The major averages are adding to the gains posted in the two previous sessions. Currently, the Dow is up 55.98 points or 0.3 percent at 21,052.10, the Nasdaq is up 6.62 points or 0.1 percent at 6,032.11 and the S&P 500 is up 5.63 points or 0.2 percent at 2,394.24. The markets have benefited from recent upward momentum, but traders seem reluctant to make significant moves following the release of a mixed batch of quarterly results. Shares of Twitter (TWTR) are moving sharply higher after the social media giant reported better than expected first quarter results. Restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is also seeing notable strength after reporting first quarter results that exceeded analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Boeing (BA) also reported first quarter earnings that exceeded analyst estimates, although the aerospace giant reported revenues that came in below expectations. Consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (PG) also reported better than expected third quarter earnings on weaker than expected revenues. Shares of U.S. Steel (X) have come under pressure after the steel giant reported a wider than expected first quarter loss on weaker than expected revenues. In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region extended a recent upward move during trading on Wednesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index surged up by 1.1 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index advanced by 0.5 percent. The major European markets also moved to the upside on the day. While the German DAX Index inched up by 0.1 percent, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index and the French CAC 40 Index both edged up by 0.2 percent. In the bond market, treasuries have pulled back near the unchanged line after seeing early strength. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is up by less than a basis point at 2.2329 percent. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Giraffes On The Savannah: Africa's 10 Tallest Skyscrapers The 10 Biggest Imports in the USA Friendly Skies: Best Airlines for Customer Satisfaction Previous Story Next Story More Commentary -Global European Shares Seen Lower On Trump Tax-plan Disappointment Sensex, Nifty Marginally Lower Ahead Of F&O Expiry Asian Markets Mostly Lower Amid Cautious Trades Sensex, Nifty Seen Lower On Weak Asian Cues Renewed Selling Pressure Seen For Thai Stock Market Indonesia Shares May Open Under Pressure Hong Kong Bourse Due For Consolidation Lower Open Called For China Shares Rally Tipped To Stall For Taiwan Stock Market Singapore Stock Market May Run Out Of Steam Win Streak May End For Malaysia Shares South Korea Stock Market Due For Profit Taking Major Averages Close Slightly Lower After Late-Day Pullback - U.S. Commentary European Markets Finish Little Changed Ahead Of ECB Meeting Stocks Seeing Modest Strength In Morning Trading - U.S. Commentary <<Previous        65 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Samsung Q1 Profit Climbs, Sees Higher Earnings Ahead; Stock Up Samsung Q1 Profit Up 46%; Rejects Holding-company Structure Las Vegas Sands Q1 Profit Rises - Update Instagram Reaches 700 Mln Users Worst Business Ideas To Be Immortalized In 'Museum Of Failure' Netflix Enters Chinese Market Through Baidu Sergey Brin Working On Secret Airship Boeing Q1 Profit Tops View, But Revenues Miss; Lifts 2017 Profit View Uber Sees Flying Cars By 2020 Number Of Subway Locations Shrink For First Time Ever Twitter Q1 Adj.

President Donald Trump is proposing to slash the corporate tax rate and offer multinational businesses a steep tax break on overseas profits brought into the United States, officials said late on Tuesday. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC that the plan would cut the business tax rate to 15 percent and that there was fundamental agreement with Congress on tax reform goals. The administration is expected to release details of the plan later on Wednesday, he said. The promise of a massive tax cut has been at the core of the post-election rally, which has driven Wall Street's indexes to record highs. However, the rally has stalled of late due to a lack of clarity on Trump's policies and the failure of his healthcare reform bill. "We think the market is pricing in fairly significant tax relief and that means there is real potential for the tax bill to disappoint," said Matthew Peterson, Chief Wealth Strategist at LPL Financial. "Certainly, the market has room to run, provided that the tax plan is credible and likely passed through Congress." At 10:54 a.m. ET (1454 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 39.58 points, or 0.19 percent, at 21,035.7. The S&P 500 was up 5.35 points, or 0.22 percent, at 2,393.96 - just seven points away from its record high. The Nasdaq Composite was up 3.79 points, or 0.06 percent, at 6,029.28, easing from an all-time high of 6,037.21. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by a 0.8 percent gain in energy as oil prices rose. Boeing's shares fell 1.5 percent and weighed the most on the Dow after the planemaker reported a decline in revenue. Procter & Gamble's 2 percent decline was also a drag on the index, after the company's quarterly profit fell. Seagate tumbled nearly 17 percent, dragging down shares of rival Western Digital, after issuing disappointing revenue forecast for the current quarter. Among gainers, Edwards Lifesciences surged 14 percent after it reported strong quarterly revenue and raised its full-year earnings forecast. The stock was the top percentage gainer on the S&P 500. Twitter jumped more than 11 percent after reporting a strong rise in monthly active users and a quarterly profit that blew past expectations. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,847 to 923. On the Nasdaq, 1,595 issues rose and 1,021 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 61 52-week highs and two lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 117 highs and 10 lows.

Stocks have been bolstered this week by easing anxiety over the future of the eurozone following centrist Emmanuel Macron's strong performance in the first round of the French election Sunday and chatter about the contours of Trump's tax cut plan. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Wednesday the administration plans to slash corporate taxes to 15 percent from 35 percent. More details will be released later in the day. About 15 minutes into trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at 20,998.44, up only slightly. The broad-based S&P 500 slipped a hair to 2,388.30, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index was virtually unchanged at 6,025.93. Dow member Boeing dropped 1.1 percent after reporting that revenues fell 7.3 percent to $21 billion, below the $21.3 billion expected by Wall Street analysts. It was only the second time in 21 quarters the company disappointed expectations. Procter & Gamble lost 2.0 percent as it reported declines in sales and profits Wednesday, saying challenging geopolitical and economic conditions hit consumer demand. Twitter surged 11.1 percent after reporting that monthly active users grew nine percent from the same period a year ago to 328 million.

By BarbaraKollmeyer Markets reporter Tax-plan Wednesday could turn into a make-or-break day for this stock market. Expect investors to zero in on what the White House has to say about corporate taxes—widely expected to be cut to 15%, as will the top income-tax rate. There’s wariness about just how much POTUS can achieve, given the pushback over health care, and there are worries about a potential government shutdown wreaking havoc in the near term. But where the market’s concerned, President Trump has some tailwinds behind him, after the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.10%  tested 21,000 and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.00%  reached 6,000 for the first time ever. On to our call of the day, which spells out what a disappointing tax plan could mean for stocks. Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADS Securities, says after recent weak economic data and mixed corporate results, the fiscal reforms are even more important. “With U.S. equity indexes trading at or near recent highs, investors have put a lot of stock behind today’s announcement, and if Trump fails to provide the specifics of his plan or explain how he intends to pay for it, then a pullback below 20,850 points for the Dow Jones and 2,375 points on the S&P 500 wouldn’t surprise us,” says Anthis. Meanwhile, LGC’s Ipek Ozkardeskaya says the DJIA’s all-time high of 21,162 “could be bettered within this week,” if the White House pleases investors. If not, she sees a move south toward the 50-day moving average of 20,740. There’s no doubt in Michael O’Rourke’s mind which way the dice will fall. The JonesTrading strategist is convinced the tax announcement will be an “unrealistic, massive disappointment.” “It will be hard (likely impossible) for the president to get his own party to approve massive unfinanced corporate tax cuts, let alone the Democrats,” he tells clients. “Many politicians in Washington want to see the president fail. The more he promises and raises expectations, the more likely it is that he will.” O’Rourke reminds us that for every single percentage point reduction in the corporate tax cut, the government has to come up with $120 billion in revenue.

By BarbaraKollmeyer Markets reporter Tax-plan Wednesday could turn into a make-or-break day for this stock market. Expect investors to zero in on what the White House has to say about corporate taxes—widely expected to be cut to 15%, as will the top income-tax rate. There’s wariness about just how much POTUS can achieve, given the pushback over health care, and there are worries about a potential government shutdown wreaking havoc in the near term. But where the market’s concerned, President Trump has some tailwinds behind him, after the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.10%  tested 21,000 and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.00%  reached 6,000 for the first time ever. On to our call of the day, which spells out what a disappointing tax plan could mean for stocks. Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADS Securities, says after recent weak economic data and mixed corporate results, the fiscal reforms are even more important. “With U.S. equity indexes trading at or near recent highs, investors have put a lot of stock behind today’s announcement, and if Trump fails to provide the specifics of his plan or explain how he intends to pay for it, then a pullback below 20,850 points for the Dow Jones and 2,375 points on the S&P 500 wouldn’t surprise us,” says Anthis. Meanwhile, LGC’s Ipek Ozkardeskaya says the DJIA’s all-time high of 21,162 “could be bettered within this week,” if the White House pleases investors. If not, she sees a move south toward the 50-day moving average of 20,740. There’s no doubt in Michael O’Rourke’s mind which way the dice will fall. The JonesTrading strategist is convinced the tax announcement will be an “unrealistic, massive disappointment.” “It will be hard (likely impossible) for the president to get his own party to approve massive unfinanced corporate tax cuts, let alone the Democrats,” he tells clients. “Many politicians in Washington want to see the president fail. The more he promises and raises expectations, the more likely it is that he will.” O’Rourke reminds us that for every single percentage point reduction in the corporate tax cut, the government has to come up with $120 billion in revenue.

His father Darius, was the previous titleholder at 4 foot, 4 inches. “Simon had a vet’s checkup three hours before the flight and was fit as a fiddle,” said the rabbit’s hopping-mad owner, U.K.-based breeder Annette Edwards. The airline cannot seem to get a break. Shares have barely recovered from an overbooking and passenger-dragging PR disaster earlier this month. Unfortunately, the rabbit had a troubled past. https://t.co/2geFXbWrv6— Kashana (@kashanacauley) April 26, 2017 Random reads A former news host at Fox News for 14 years joined a racial discrimination lawsuit against the outlet.

By BarbaraKollmeyer Markets reporter Tax-plan Wednesday could turn into a make-or-break day for this stock market. Expect investors to zero in on what the White House has to say about corporate taxes—widely expected to be cut to 15%, as will the top income-tax rate. There’s wariness about just how much POTUS can achieve, given the pushback over health care, and there are worries about a potential government shutdown wreaking havoc in the near term. But where the market’s concerned, President Trump has some tailwinds behind him, after the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.10%  tested 21,000 and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.00%  reached 6,000 for the first time ever. On to our call of the day, which spells out what a disappointing tax plan could mean for stocks. Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADS Securities, says after recent weak economic data and mixed corporate results, the fiscal reforms are even more important. “With U.S. equity indexes trading at or near recent highs, investors have put a lot of stock behind today’s announcement, and if Trump fails to provide the specifics of his plan or explain how he intends to pay for it, then a pullback below 20,850 points for the Dow Jones and 2,375 points on the S&P 500 wouldn’t surprise us,” says Anthis. Meanwhile, LGC’s Ipek Ozkardeskaya says the DJIA’s all-time high of 21,162 “could be bettered within this week,” if the White House pleases investors. If not, she sees a move south toward the 50-day moving average of 20,740. There’s no doubt in Michael O’Rourke’s mind which way the dice will fall. The JonesTrading strategist is convinced the tax announcement will be an “unrealistic, massive disappointment.” “It will be hard (likely impossible) for the president to get his own party to approve massive unfinanced corporate tax cuts, let alone the Democrats,” he tells clients. “Many politicians in Washington want to see the president fail. The more he promises and raises expectations, the more likely it is that he will.” O’Rourke reminds us that for every single percentage point reduction in the corporate tax cut, the government has to come up with $120 billion in revenue. If you were freaking out about deficits in 2012 but support tax cuts as stimulus now... pic.twitter.com/ePKmo6rfQ0— Dow (@mark_dow) April 25, 2017 Key market gauges New highs? It is looking tough.

His father Darius, was the previous titleholder at 4 foot, 4 inches. “Simon had a vet’s checkup three hours before the flight and was fit as a fiddle,” said the rabbit’s hopping-mad owner, U.K.-based breeder Annette Edwards. The airline cannot seem to get a break. Shares have barely recovered from an overbooking and passenger-dragging PR disaster earlier this month.

Tax plan: President Trump plans to present his new tax plan on Wednesday. Businesses will be interested to see if Trump explicitly pushes for the 15% corporate tax rate he promised during the campaign. Another key question is whether Trump calls for real tax reform or just fleeting tax cuts. The plan is likely to face a couple major hurdles: Tax cuts are expensive, and Trump risks angering deficit hawks if he hasn't found a way to make up for the lost revenue. Democrats are unlikely to vote for the proposal without major concessions. "Stocks may pause on Wednesday as the market waits for the reaction from Congress who actually has to pass the bill," said Kathleen Brooks, the research director at City Index. 2. Boeing earnings: Boeing will release its quarterly earnings before the opening bell on Wednesday. The company said earlier this month that the number of planes it delivered in the first quarter dipped this year compared to 2016. Investors will be looking for any comments on Boeing's efforts to sell airliners to Iran. Relations between Iran and the U.S. have been strained under Trump, who has been critical of the nuclear deal that was signed under the Obama administration. The deal made the Boeing sales possible. 3. Earnings bonanza: A slew of major companies will report their quarterly results on Wednesday. Anthem, Boeing, Dr Pepper Snapple, PepsiCo, Fiat Chrysler and Procter & Gamble are among the firms set to release earnings before the opening bell. PayPal and Amgen will follow after the close. 4. Global market overview: U.S. stock futures were flat early on Wednesday. Most European markets opened lower, as the French election rally began to fade. Asian markets ended the session higher. The Dow Jones industrial average closed 1.1% higher on Tuesday, while the S&P 500 added 0.6%. The Nasdaq increased 0.7% to surpass the 6,000 point milestone.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 26 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Research Report and Overview on Professional Hair Care Products Market 2014-2020 Beauty and personal care industry includes skin care, hair care, oral care, cosmetics, toiletries, and others. Of all the aforementioned segments, demand for hair care products has restored from 2013. Consumers are becoming sophisticated in nature which has led to change in buying patterns for personal care products. Thishas led to introduction of customized products sustaining the assorted need of the consumers based on different cultures, hair types, and regions. Also, rising concerns for hair protection, demand for professional hair care products is expected to increase in the next five to six years. Professional hair care products are predicted to record a growth of around 5% to 6% annually in the near future. Factors such ashair stylist recommendations, efficacy of the products, and increasing penetration of hair care services are expected to bolster the professional hair care products market growth in near future. The professional hair care market is expected to witness growth due to factors such as increased consumer spending on personal care products, growing disposable income of consumers in emerging nations, and increasing penetration of hair salon services across the globe. In addition, changing hair grooming pattern especially among the male consumers is expected to fuel the market growth. However, high pricing coupled with less availability of professional hair care products across the designed distribution channels are restricting the market growth. Although, the professional hair care products market has attained a maturity level in developed countries, introduction of highly specialized products in shampoo and hair colorant category is anticipated to enhance the market growth. Also, in developing countries introduction of products addressing issues of consumers related to grey hair, dandruff and hair loss are expected to fuel the market growth. For instance, in India inclination of consumers towards enhanced hair appearance is a key trend leading to a shift in consumers from conventional products to professional hair care products. Furthermore, increasing product visibility across multi retail outlets aids the market growth during 2015-2020. Request Report Sample@ www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-gb-207 The professional hair care products market is segmented on the basis of product type, and distribution channels. The various professional hair care products are broadly classified as conditioners, shampoos, hair colorants, hair serums, hair masks, hair sprays, and others. Among abovementioned products, the hair colorants category is expected to witness a growth of around 8% to 9% as compared to the other products. The various distribution channels through which the professional hair care products are marketed include spa and salons, web or online shopping stores, supermarkets and hypermarkets, speciality stores, and others. North America is expected to dominate the market during the forecast period, accounting for more than 30% of the market share by 2020. However, Asia pacific is expected to record highest CAGR as compared to other regions.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 26 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman 3 Surprises in Kimberly-Clark Corp’s Quarterly Results Kimberly-Clark (NYSE: KMB) has a relatively stable business thanks to its deep portfolio of consumer brands like Kleenex tissues and Huggies diapers that millions of people use on a daily basis. But that doesn’t mean the company can’t occasionally surprise investors with shifts in its operating trends and changes in the market outlook. With that in mind, here are three important things from this past week’s quarterly report that shareholders likely didn’t see coming. A drop in prices The company posted a 1% decline in organic sales, continuing a disappointing trend around revenue gains. Its expansion pace was a healthy 5% for the 2015 fiscal year, before slowing to a 2% pace last year and falling again to a slightly negative rate to kick off fiscal 2017. Image source: Getty Images. The biggest factor in this latest slump was lower prices. Kimberly-Clark reduced net selling prices by more than a full percentage point, which wiped out the gains produced by the minor uptick in sales volumes. Management blamed spiking competition in the U.S. market for the shift. Organic sales dove by 3% in that segment, „reflecting category softness, competitive activity, and less promotion shipments,” executives explained. Rival Unilever (NYSE: UL) fared better by posting a 1% organic sales drop in the U.S. geography as it gained share despite a shrinking overall industry. Kimberly-Clark, in contrast, couldn’t claim market-share gains and instead had to settle for rising profits. „We delivered earnings growth despite a challenging environment, particularly in North America,” CEO Thomas Falk said in a press release. Costs and currencies Currency exchange rates changes have swung from a having a heavy weight on results to giving a slight boost. In fact, currency shifts increased reported sales by 1% this quarter, after having caused a 4% reduction last year and a whopping 11% hit in 2015. Image source: Getty Images. As a result, management now sees foreign exchange moves having zero effect on sales or profits this year, compared to its prior forecast of a 2% decline in both. However, that surprising gain is being completely offset by rising commodity costs. Kimberly-Clark has seen a few core inputs spike, and so cost inflation is projected to be about $200 million in 2017 compared to a prior estimate of $125 million. There’s no bottom-line effect on earnings between these two trends, which is why the company still projects 2017 profits will weigh in at between $6.20 per share and $6.35 per share, up roughly 5% from the $5.99 per share it posted last year. Lower outlook Kimberly-Clark doesn’t see the weak conditions in the U.S. market improving any time soon. Falk and his team now project overall organic gains coming in at 1.5% at the midpoint of guidance, which is a slight downgrade from their prior forecast of 2%. By comparison, Unilever expects to grow by 4%. If the company doesn’t outperform the latest target, 2017 will mark the second straight year that Kimberly-Clark has endured slowing sales growth, with organic revenue gains slumping from 5% to less than 2% since 2015. Executives are ramping up their cost-cutting plans and will likely consider aggressive portfolio improvements to get sales growth back on track — just as rivals have done in recent years. Unilever, for example, is divesting its spreads business and adding new product lines like Dollar Shave Club. Procter & Gamble  just finished a huge portfolio reboot that saw it remove 100 brands from the portfolio to concentrate on just the fastest-growing, highest-margin franchises. Initiatives like these might be needed as part of a bigger plan by Kimberly-Clark to improve its competitive position in the market now that it is losing share to global rivals as they step up their promotions and innovation strategies. 10 stocks we like better than Kimberly-Clark When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Google parent Alphabet will provide an update that day. The search and ad giant has been in the news recently over concerns about ads appearing on inappropriate YouTube content. Amazon will also report, and we'll be looking to see if the firm can continue to push gross margins higher. Third, we have Microsoft, which has been on a roll recently, with the cloud growing quickly and legacy businesses holding their own. Intel is also due. We're expecting modest growth for the year as data center growth is offset by declines in PC sales. There are plenty of consumer firms reporting, too, including Chipotle, Coca-Cola, Pepsico, Starbucks, and Procter & Gamble. We'll get a sense of the industrial economy from Alcoa, 3M, Boeing, Ford, and GM. In healthcare, Express Scripts, Eli Lilly, and Amgen will report. And finally, oil majors Chevron and Exxon Mobil are due Friday.

News sign-up Global brands connect across cultures News, 26 April 2017 Topics Localisation of international work Global, multinational advertising GLOBAL: Becoming a successful global brand requires an understanding of local cultures, lifestyles and ideologies, according to two industry figures. In a WARC Best Practice paper, How global brands resonate across cultures, Sue Mizera and Alessandra Cotugno, senior executives at Young & Rubicam, observe that the standardisation of brand name, logo, image, packaging and brand positioning simply enables brand recognition in multiple markets. But to be truly successful, they argue, brands need to adapt their communications to reflect local values and culture – no easy task in a "global brand-scape [that] is a minefield of complexity, diversity and cultural nuances". For example, there are regional skews in how people relate to global and local brands. In the East, global brands are seen as daring, high quality and trendy, while local brands are seen as reliable, popular and down to earth. By contrast, global brands in the West are seen as distinctive, leaders, high performance and unique while local brands are seen as best brands, trustworthy, straightforward and obliging. "Not one attribute overlaps," the authors note. Further, different brand values emerge as more important in different countries: Germans like the notion of directness, for example, while Indonesians prefer kindness and South Koreans favour energetic brands. Global brands "immerse themselves not just in the language and habits of a culture but in its value system, vernacular, idioms, humour, customs, beliefs and philosophies," say Mizera and Cotugno, holding up IKEA as an example of a "masterful" practitioner of these arts. Such brands connect to the lifestyle and, bringing "an outsider's caring and concerned perspective", they solve local cultural problems. They are able to present alternative views, take a stand and stimulate debate – witness the award-winning Share the Load campaign in India for Procter & Gamble's Ariel laundry detergent which not only challenged hierarchies of gender and status but doubled sales volumes. A common feature of the most successful global brands, such as Disney, McDonald's and Coca-Cola, the authors observe, is that they "are masters at re-engineering their brands, culture to culture, while never, ever losing their souls". As well as exploring what global brands do, Mizera and Cotugno examine how they do it – by re-aligning their marketing to put global even more in the service of local. "It's vital to dial up and dial down, from central creation to local adaptation and back to central for revisions, thus delivering the brand's DNA, appropriately nuanced, and fostering new ways of working," they say.

Emmanuel Macron avoided a pitfall on his path to the French presidency, largely quieting an angry crowd of factory workers who’d been fired up a couple of hours earlier by his rival Marine Le Pen. The scene in front of the gates of the Whirlpool appliance plant at Amiens in northern France, Macron’s hometown, had the makings of a media ambush, and it ignited what’s likely to be a combative closing stretch of the campaign. The centrist frontrunner was there to meet union officials at the factory, which is slated to close — a difficult but apparently routine event. Instead, it became a media circus when Le Pen unexpectedly showed up. The populist leader, who accuses France’s mainstream politicians of selling out to globalization, posed for photos with workers on the picket line. She blasted Macron for showing “contempt” for their plight by holding his talks behind closed doors. Footage rapidly spread across social media. Less than two hours later, Macron, the 39-year old defender of free trade and the European Union, rejigged his plans and arrived at the factory himself, to be greeted by burning tires and some shouts of “Marine President.” But Macron didn’t budge. For an hour and twenty minutes, he absorbed much of the anger and taunts, vowed to tell the truth about what was possible, and slammed Le Pen for demagoguery. “When she tells you the solution is to turn back globalization, she’s lying,” he said. ‘HE TRIED’ Some in the crowd continued to jeer at Macron for a while, but by the time he left there was no booing. He shook hands with all the workers. At least one of them had been convinced. “When he arrived I was not happy to see him — he came because she came,” said Celia Blagny, a 20-year-old factory employee. “But he spoke to us. I’m not sure he can truly help us. But he tried.” Blagny said she’s no fan of Le Pen, but her views of Macron changed after the encounter: “He was quiet and honest.” She said she may now try to persuade her mother “to go for Macron instead of staying home.” The showdown in the medium-sized industrial town, a scene of battles in both world wars, encapsulates the fight over free trade and European cooperation that’s central to the election. Macron says he’s defending the bulwarks of France’s prosperity over half a century, while Le Pen argues that they’re no longer working for most French people. For Macron, the stakes were high. The political novice and former banker is tipped by polls to win the May 7 runoff handily, by as much as 20 percentage points. But he stumbled at the start of the two-week, head-to-head contest that followed last weekend’s first round of voting. ‘LIKE AN ELITIST’ Macron held a celebratory dinner in Paris for campaign staff, which played perfectly into Le Pen’s effort to paint him as an out-of-touch member of the country’s privileged ruling caste. Today’s scene at the factory had the potential to reinforce that branding. “Le Pen knows the only shot she has at winning is making Macron look like an elitist,” said Antonio Barroso, an analyst at Teneo Research in London. “The irony is she may have handed him the perfect counter-punch and he looks set to dominate the news cycle.” Amiens is part of the Hauts de France region, which has an unemployment rate of about 12 percent, the highest in the country. Le Pen scored almost a third of the vote there in the first round, while Macron tied for second place with far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon. Macron stuck to his free-trade positions during his tour of the region, repeatedly citing a nearby Procter & Gamble factory that exports 90 percent of its output. “If Madame Le Pen is elected, this company closes. And I can mention dozens like it,” he said. Le Pen’s charge that Macron is too cozy with the bosses did resonate with some of the Amiens crowd. “Macron is the worst of free-market politics,” said Clement Pons, a 32-year-old unemployed man. “He’s a globalist who will kill the working class. He makes me want to throw up.” There may be more confrontational scenes in the coming days, as Le Pen seeks to overturn her poll deficit. “War Declared” was Liberation newspaper’s Thursday headline.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1% to 20,975.09, while the S&P 500 fell 0.05% to 2,387.45 and the Nasdaq 100 softened 0.13% to 5,541.09. Trump’s chief economic adviser Gary Cohn and treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed on Wednesday afternoon that the President’s plan would cut the number of federal individual income tax brackets to three from seven, and slash corporate tax rates to 15% from 35%. Trump tweeted on Saturday that his administration was set to make a big announcement on tax mid-week, after telling the Associated Press a day earlier that his proposal would contain a "massive tax cut" for businesses and individuals. During the campaign when Trump floated the tax cut analysts said that it would enlarge the country’s deficit. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said that it is unclear whether any of Trump’s proposals will pass through Congress unmolested, especially as the November 2015 Bipartisan Budget Act, which suspended America’s debt ceiling, lapsed on 15 March. Mould said Trump has a lot less room for manoeuvre than Ronald Reagan, to whom he is regularly compared for his tax-cutting and deregulating zeal, as Trump has taken control at a time when interest rates and inflation are rising, federal debt stands at nearly $20trn, a record high, or 105% of GDP, US stocks look expensive after an eight-year bull run, and US corporations are already paying historically low tax. US companies’ tax bills represented just 7.5% of pre-tax profit and 3.4% of sales in 2016, according to Federal Reserve data. Mould said that a tax cut to 15% would likely add 1.5 percentage points to corporate profit margins, using that 3.4% tax paid-to-sales ratio as the starting point and on a total company sales base of $15.6trn, the equivalent to around $225bn, or 13% of the aggregate post-tax profits made by corporate America in 2016. “This is the profit uplift that the Wall Street lemmings are clearly seeking, but the S&P 500 is already up 11% since Trump’s election, while it remains to be seen whether such a windfall is landed, given likely opposition in Washington and how American corporations’ tax affairs already seem to be run very efficiently,” he said. In corporate news, Twitter surged 7.91% after it posted better-than-expected earnings and revenues with user growth exceeding forecasts. Health insurer Anthem rose 3.81% after it said first-quarter profit rose 44%, while PepsiCo fell 0.73% after it reported a 42% increase in first-quarter profit. Procter and Gamble was down 2.51% after posting disappointing sales due to slow consumer spending, while Hershey fell 0.89% after the chocolate and sweets maker topped profit forecasts, but revenue fell short. Boeing dipped 1.66% after better-than-expected earnings but weaker-than-forecast revenue and United Technologies was up 1.14% after posting a 17.8% rise in quarterly profit.

Roselle Chen reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript U.S. stocks ticked lower as investors worried about President Donald Trump's tax cuts. Trump administration proposed to slash business tax rates by the end of this year. But it offered no specifics on how to pay for it without increasing the deficit. The dip in stocks came after two sessions of markets hitting record highs on upbeat corporate earnings. Chris Ailman, chief investment officer at CalSTRS (SOUNDBITE) CHRIS AILMAN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, CALSTRS (ENGLISH) SAYING: "When the U.S. equity market runs like this, we take advantage of it, create some liquidity, and try and buy into some other when they're down a little bit." Among stocks, United Technologies rose after reporting a quarterly profit that beat expectations. On the flip side, Boeing fell after coming in with a decline in revenue. And also falling, Procter & Gamble, after reporting lower quarterly profit. European stocks got a kick from earnings. The CAC 40 hit a nine-year high building on gains from the recent vote in the presidential election.

The scene in front of the gates of the Whirlpool appliance plant at Amiens in northern France, Macron’s hometown, had the makings of a media ambush, and it ignited what’s likely to be a combative closing stretch of the campaign.The centrist frontrunner was there to meet union officials at the factory, which is slated to close -- a difficult but apparently routine event. Instead, it became a media circus when Le Pen unexpectedly showed up. The populist leader, who accuses France’s mainstream politicians of selling out to globalization, posed for photos with workers on the picket line. She blasted Macron for showing “contempt” for their plight by holding his talks behind closed doors. Footage rapidly spread across social media. Emmanuel Macron arrives at the Whirlpool plant. Photographer: Christophe Morin/Bloomberg Less than two hours later, Macron, the 39-year old defender of free trade and the European Union, rejigged his plans and arrived at the factory himself, to be greeted by burning tires and some shouts of “Marine President.” But Macron didn’t budge. For an hour and twenty minutes, he absorbed much of the anger and taunts, vowed to tell the truth about what was possible, and slammed Le Pen for demagoguery. “When she tells you the solution is to turn back globalization, she’s lying,” he said. ‘He Tried’ Some in the crowd continued to jeer at Macron for a while, but by the time he left there was no booing. He shook hands with all the workers. At least one of them had been convinced. Get the latest on global politics in your inbox, every day. Get our newsletter daily. Sign Up “When he arrived I was not happy to see him -- he came because she came,” said Celia Blagny, a 20-year-old factory employee. “But he spoke to us. I’m not sure he can truly help us. But he tried.” Blagny said she’s no fan of Le Pen, but her views of Macron changed after the encounter: “He was quiet and honest.” She said she may now try to persuade her mother “to go for Macron instead of staying home.” The showdown in the medium-sized industrial town, a scene of battles in both world wars, encapsulates the fight over free trade and European cooperation that’s central to the election. Macron says he’s defending the bulwarks of France’s prosperity over half a century, while Le Pen argues that they’re no longer working for most French people. For Macron, the stakes were high. The political novice and former banker is tipped by polls to win the May 7 runoff handily, by as much as 20 percentage points. But he stumbled at the start of the two-week, head-to-head contest that followed last weekend’s first round of voting. ‘Like an Elitist’ Macron held a celebratory dinner in Paris for campaign staff, which played perfectly into Le Pen’s effort to paint him as an out-of-touch member of the country’s privileged ruling caste. Wednesday’s scene at the factory had the potential to reinforce that branding. Le Pen meets supporters outside the Whirlpool plant. Photographer: Christophe Petit Tesson/EPA “Le Pen knows the only shot she has at winning is making Macron look like an elitist,” said Antonio Barroso, an analyst at Teneo Research in London. “The irony is she may have handed him the perfect counter-punch and he looks set to dominate the news cycle.” Amiens is part of the Hauts de France region, which has an unemployment rate of about 12 percent, the highest in the country. Le Pen scored almost a third of the vote there in the first round, while Macron tied for second place with far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon. Macron stuck to his free-trade positions during his tour of the region, repeatedly citing a nearby Procter & Gamble factory that exports 90 percent of its output. “If Madame Le Pen is elected, this company closes. And I can mention dozens like it,” he said. Le Pen’s charge that Macron is too cozy with the bosses did resonate with some of the Amiens crowd. “Macron is the worst of free-market politics,” said Clement Pons, a 32-year-old unemployed man. “He’s a globalist who will kill the working class. He makes me want to throw up.” There may be more confrontational scenes in the coming days, as Le Pen seeks to overturn her poll deficit. “War Declared” was Liberation newspaper’s Thursday headline.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) (Reuters) - U.S. stocks hovered near record levels on Wednesday ahead of a highly anticipated tax plan, while a flood of quarterly earnings reports kept investors busy. President Donald Trump is proposing to slash the corporate tax rate and offer multinational businesses a steep tax break on overseas profits brought into the United States, officials said late on Tuesday. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC that the business tax rate would be cut to 15 percent under the plan and that there was fundamental agreement with Congress on tax reform goals. The administration is expected to release details of the plan later on Wednesday, he said. The promise of a massive tax cut has been at the core of the post-election rally, which has driven Wall Street’s indexes to record highs. However, the rally has stalled of late due to a lack of clarity on Mr. Trump’s policies and the failure of his healthcare reform bill. “We think the market is pricing in fairly significant tax relief and that means there is real potential for the tax bill to disappoint,” said Matthew Peterson, Chief Wealth Strategist at LPL Financial. “Certainly, the market has room to run, provided that the tax plan is credible and likely passed through Congress.” At 12:36 p.m. ET (1636 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 55.1 points, or 0.26 percent, at 21,051.22. The S&P 500 was up 5.23 points, or 0.22 percent, at 2,393.84. The index had come within just two points of its all-time high of 2,400.98 earlier in the day. The Nasdaq Composite was up 5.59 points, or 0.09 percent, at 6,031.09, easing from a record intraday high of 6,039.28. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by a 0.8 percent rise in healthcare. The sector got the biggest boost from Thermo Fisher and Edwards Lifesciences , both of which surged on strong results and upbeat forecasts. United Technologies rose 1.8 percent and provided the biggest boost to the Dow, after reporting a quarterly profit that beat expectations. On the flip side, Boeing shares fell about 1 percent and weighed on the Dow after the planemaker reported a decline in revenue. Procter & Gamble declined 2 percent after reporting lower quarterly profit. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,860 to 1,004. On the Nasdaq, 1,769 issues rose and 972 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 71 52-week highs and two lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 174 highs and 13 lows.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.10% ended 0.1% lower at 20,975.09, the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.05% finished off 1.16 point, or less than 0.1%, at 2,387.45, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.00% which touched a fresh intraday record of 6,040.89 before retreating, closed little-changed at 6,025.23--holding above its psychologically significant level of 6,000, hit Tuesday. In a news conference Wednesday at 1:30 p.m. Eastern Time, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn produced a one-page outline of the eagerly awaited tax plan, but the lack of details appeared to disappoint investors. The yield on the 10-year Treasury yield [BX:TMUBMUSD10Y]slipped to 2.30%, highlighting a pick up in bidding for haven government bonds. Bond prices and yields move inversely. One bright spot, the Russell 2000 Index RUT, +0.59% a gauge of small-capitalization companies, and those mostly likely to benefit from tax cuts geared to small-business owners, ended at a record at 1,419.43, up 0.6%. Proposals to reduce the corporate tax rate to 15% from 35%, have boosted shares of small-cap stocks, which are up 2.9% for the week, compared with a 1.7% weekly rise for the S&P 500 and 2.1% for the Dow. In corporate action, Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, +1.41% led gains for the Dow, while shares of Procter & Gamble Co. PG, -2.51% topped losses for blue-chips, down 2.5%. Twitter Inc. TWTR, +7.91% also closed up nearly 8%, after reporting better-than-expected quarterly results. Moves for equities come amid a deluge of quarterly results that, so far, have mostly bolstered optimism about the rise in the stock market since Trump's election victory in November.

X European shares edge up as quarterly earnings flood in Ireland’s benchmark index does not follow suit and closes down 0.12% after flat day about 14 hours ago Peter Hamilton A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. US stocks hovered near record levels on Wednesday ahead of a highly anticipated tax plan. Photographer: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg         European stocks started the day on a positive note but calmed down towards the end of trade as earnings season entered full swing. DUBLIN It was another flat day on Ireland’s benchmark index which closed down by 0.12 per cent. Glanbia had the most negative impact on the Iseq 20 and closed down by 2.53 per cent. The company reported first-quarter earnings with growth not as strong as expected in the group’s nutritionals division, according to traders. However, Davy stockbrokers reiterated its “outperform” call on the stock while Goodbody retained its “buy” recommendation. Another company that reported earnings was CRH, which closed up by 0.67 per cent at €33.675. Davy stockbrokers forecast a continuation of acquisition activity in the company, given the strength of its balance sheet. The building materials company had a more modest performance in London where it closed up 0.4 per cent. There were two Irish companies in the top 10 fallers in Europe’s STOXX 600 index: Glanbia and Bank of Ireland. According to traders, the latter has had a good run and its drop on Wednesday by 2.53 per cent wasn’t a terribly significant move for the stock. Independent News and Media continued its positive run and closed up by 0.76 per cent at €0.132. Irish Residential Properties REIT, Hibernia REIT and Green REIT all saw gains between 0.6 and 1.55 per cent on the day but, according to traders, their moves were not connected. LONDON British shares rose on Wednesday as gains for Standard Chartered and other companies reporting well-received results helped offset a pullback in healthcare stocks. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index closed up 0.2 per cent, broadly in line with other European bourses, and rising for the third straight session. Standard Chartered was the biggest gainer, rising 4 per cent after its quarterly profit nearly doubled from a year ago as the bank brought loan losses under control. Fellow lenders Barclays and Lloyds Banking Group both rose about 0.8 per cent. Among those boosted by earnings statements was chemicals company Croda, which rose 3.8 per cent to a record high. Heavyweight drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline fell more than 2 per cent after reporting first-quarter figures, while Shire dropped 0.6 per cent. A big faller among blue-chips was GKN, down 1.8 per cent, after the engineering group warned that the encouraging growth rate achieved to date may not last. EUROPE French luxury group Kering hit a record high on Wednesday after reporting strong sales and European shares hovered near a 20-month peak, supported by a wave of earnings results that largely outperformed market expectations. The pan-European benchmark gained 0.47 per cent in early trading as luxury stocks and financials underpinned gains. Other luxury names across Europe rose on Kering’s momentum, with Moncler and Salvatore Ferragamo top of Italy’s blue-chips, while LVMH climbed earlier in the day but ultimately closed down by 0.76 per cent. Fallers were led by Bic, which plunged 10.26 per cent to a more than two-year low, after its first-quarter net income and sales fell on weak US demand. Credit Suisse, which kicked off much-anticipated results for European banks with a beat and plans for a $4 billion cash call, rose 2.68 per cent. NEW YORK US stocks hovered near record levels on Wednesday ahead of a highly anticipated tax plan, while a flood of quarterly earnings reports kept investors busy. Boeing’s shares fell and weighed the most on the Dow after the planemaker reported a decline in revenue. Procter & Gamble’s decline was also a drag on the index, after the company’s quarterly profit fell. Seagate tumbled, dragging down shares of rival Western Digital, after issuing disappointing revenue forecast for the current quarter. Twitter also jumped after reporting a strong rise in monthly active users and a quarterly profit that blew past expectations. – (Additional reporting: Reuters)       Topics: Salvatore Ferragamo Bank of Ireland Barclays Boeing CRH Credit Suisse Croda GKN GSK Glanbia Hibernia HMDC Independent News Irish Residential Properties Reit Kering LVMH Lloyds of London Media Procter and Gamble Seagate Standard Chartered Group Western Digital Europe Ireland Italy London(GB) New York City United States Read More Saudi Arabia lists largest ever sukuk on Irish Stock exchange European shares pull back from 20-month highs Nasdaq tops 6,000 as strong earnings boost confidence European investors shift focus from politics Euro stalls after rally as Canadian dollar floored by US duties Iseq soars to nine-year high as markets cheer French vote Macron victory in French poll drives European relief rally What markets should conclude from France’s election Euro and stocks dip ahead of tight election in France Business and markets fret ahead of French presidential vote  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Financial Services New lending up at AIB as impaired loans decline by €500m Technology Review: Is the iKettle 2.0 worth the investment?

President Donald Trump is proposing to slash the corporate tax rate and offer multinational businesses a steep tax break on overseas profits brought into the United States, officials said late on Tuesday. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC that business tax rate would be cut to 15 percent under the plan and that there was fundamental agreement with Congress on tax reform goals. The administration is expected to release details of the plan later on Wednesday, he said. The promise of a massive tax cut has been at the core of the post-election rally, which has driven Wall Street's indexes to record highs. However, the rally has stalled of late due to a lack of clarity on Trump's policies and the failure of his healthcare reform bill. "We think the market is pricing in fairly significant tax relief and that means there is real potential for the tax bill to disappoint," said Matthew Peterson, Chief Wealth Strategist at LPL Financial. "Certainly, the market has room to run, provided that the tax plan is credible and likely passed through Congress." At 12:36 p.m. ET (1636 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 55.1 points, or 0.26 percent, at 21,051.22. The S&P 500 was up 5.23 points, or 0.22 percent, at 2,393.84. The index had come within just 2 points of its all-time high of 2,400.98 earlier in the day. The Nasdaq Composite was up 5.59 points, or 0.09 percent, at 6,031.09, easing from a record intraday high of 6,039.28. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by a 0.8 percent rise in healthcare. The sector got the biggest boost from Thermo Fisher and Edwards Lifesciences , both of which surged on strong results and upbeat forecasts. United Technologies rose 1.8 percent and provided the biggest boost to the Dow, after reporting a quarterly profit that beat expectations. On the flip side, Boeing shares fell about 1 percent and weighed on the Dow after the planemaker reported a decline in revenue. Procter & Gamble declined 2 percent after reporting lower quarterly profit. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,860 to 1,004. On the Nasdaq, 1,769 issues rose and 972 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 71 52-week highs and two lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 174 highs and 13 lows.
