ADD TO PORTFOLIO ADD TO WATCHLIST SHARE YOUR OULOOK ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz PEER COMPANIES Good Morning, Dear ETMarkets Reader! Stock markets across the world breathed a sigh of relief on Monday after Emmanuel Macron secured the French presidency; Japan stocks hit a 16-month high, Kospi hit new record; but S&P500 and Nasdaq Composite ended flattish while European stocks closed slightly lower. The domestic market, too, reflected some relief, but is likely to slip into the consolidation mode again on Tuesday if one were to go by signs on the technical charts. Let’s check out what all might matter to Dalal Street through the day: Cues from Singapore mixed At 7 am this morning, Nifty futures were quoting mildly higher on Singapore Stock Exchange, in indications that the market is likely to remain rangebound, Nifty50 formed Bullish Harami The 50-pack index formed a ‘Bullish Harami’ pattern on the daily chart in Monday’s trade, which indicates indecisiveness and that the bears are not getting a grip on the market. Monday’s session was more of a continuation of the consolidation pattern with a minor uptick. An inside bar occurred, as the Nifty50 formed a lower high and higher low. Market experts see no major surge in the domestic equity indices in the coming sessions. HUDCO IPO subscribed 63% on Day 1 The Rs 1,224 crore initial public offering of state-run Housing and Urban Development Corporation (Hudco) kicked off on Monday, with the issue getting bids for over 63 per cent of the issue size on the first day of the bidding process. Data available with NSE showed that the issue had received bids for 129,136,800 shares, compared with 2,04,058,747 shares on the block. Mega merger on the cards? Procter & Gamble Hygiene & Healthcare and Gillette India, the Indian subsidiaries of NYSE-listed Procter & Gamble, announced special dividends, which some perceive as a precursor to the merger of the two companies. Globally, all P&G brands are under one company, except for in India. Traders go for gamma scalping In a situation where declining volatility and range-bound markets have made purchasing or selling plain vanilla options an unattractive proposition, savvy traders are beating the odds by resorting to the gamma scalping strategy. This is done by buying Call or Put options and selling buying underlying stock futures, or through a combination of Call or Put options. IMF says Asia at risk The International Monetary Fund said Asia's economic outlook faces "significant" uncertainty and downside growth risks from any sudden tightening in global financial conditions or rise in protectionist trade policies. The IMF, which in April raised its 2017 Asia-Pacific growth forecast to 5.5 percent from its previous October forecast of 5.4 percent, said loose monetary and fiscal policies across most of the region would underpin domestic demand. Global markets mixed Asian markets were trading mixed on Tuesday morning. Chinese stocks looked weak but Hang Seng and Kospi were ruling higher. European markets turned a bit weak on Monday whole US stocks finishes flattish in overnight trade. The S&P 500 index barely finished in the positive territory, up less than a point, but it was enough to represent a record for the broad-market benchmark at 2,399, after briefly hitting a new intraday record of 2,401 in early trading. The Nasdaq also managed a record at 6,102.66, but finished flat, up 1.90 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 5.34 points, or less than 0.1%, at 21,012.

Instagram eventually apologized, and claimed it had been removed “accidentally.” RUPI KAUR AND PRABH KAUR U.S. Periods Women's Health Tampon Tax Health Let’s begin with the obvious: Every woman in the history of humanity has or had a period. Each month, her uterus sheds its lining, sending blood flowing out through her vagina (unless she’s pregnant, in which case she gets a lengthy reprieve). This process is as natural as eating, drinking and sleeping, and it’s beautiful too: There’s no human race without it. Yet most of us loathe talking about it. When girls first start their periods, they embark on a decades-long journey of silence and dread. Periods hurt. They cause backaches and cramps, not to mention a cloud of emotional ickiness—and this goes on every month, for 30 to 40 years. In public, people discuss periods as often as they discuss diarrhea. Women shove pads or tampons up their sleeves on their way to the bathroom so no one knows it’s their “time of the month.” They get bloodstains on their clothes. They stick wads of toilet paper in their underwear when they’re caught without supplies. Meanwhile, ad campaigns sanitize this bloody mess with scenes of light blue liquids gently cascading onto fluffy white pads while women frolic in form-fitting white jeans. In a 1978 satire for Ms. magazine, feminist pioneer Gloria Steinem answered the question that so many women have asked: “What would happen, for instance, if suddenly, magically, men could menstruate and women could not? The answer is clear—menstruation would become an enviable, boast-worthy, masculine event: Men would brag about how long and how much,” she wrote. Steinem envisioned a world where “men-struation” justifies men’s place pretty much everywhere: in combat, political office, religious leadership positions and medical schools. We’d have “Paul Newman Tampons” and “Muhammad Ali’s Rope-a-Dope Pads” and a new model for compliments: Subscribe to Newsweek from $1 per week “Man, you lookin’ good!” “Yeah, man, I’m on the rag!” Nearly 40 years later, Steinem’s essay still stings because “menstrual equity” has gone almost nowhere. Today, tampons and pads are taxed in most states while adult diapers, Viagra, Rogaine and potato chips are not. Men can walk into any bathroom and access all of the supplies they need to care for themselves: toilet paper, soap, paper towels, even seat covers. Women, however, cannot. In most schools, girls have to trek to the nurse’s office to ask for a pad or tampon, as if menstruating is an illness rather than a natural function. In most public and private places, women are lucky if there’s a cranky machine on the wall charging a few quarters for a pad that’s so uncomfortable you might prefer to use a wad of rough toilet paper instead. No change? You can pay for a parking spot with a credit card, but have you ever seen such technology on a tampon machine in a women’s bathroom? The situation for prison inmates and homeless women is far direr. Even if you do have access to tampons, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not require companies to list the ingredients—yet the average woman has a tampon inside her vagina for more than 100,000 hours over her lifetime. Tampons may contain “residue from chemical herbicides,” says Sharra Vostral, a historian at Purdue University who wrote Under Wraps: A History of Menstrual Hygiene Technology. “We do not really understand the health consequences, because we are not testing for them in relation to tampons.” Close If all this sounds unfair, try getting your period in the developing world. Taboos, poverty, inadequate sanitary facilities, meager health education and an enduring culture of silence create an environment in which girls and women are denied what should be a basic right: clean, affordable menstrual materials and safe, private spaces to care for themselves. At least 500 million girls and women globally lack adequate facilities for managing their periods, according to a 2015 report from UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO). In rural India, one in five girls drops out of school after they start menstruating , according to research by Nielsen and Plan India, and of the 355 million menstruating girls and women in the country, just 12 percent use sanitary napkins. “In today’s world, if there’s nobody dying it’s not on anyone’s agenda,” says Venkatraman Chandra-Mouli, a WHO scientist who’s worked in adolescent health for the past 20 years. “Menstrual problems don’t kill anyone, but for me, they are still an extremely important issue because they affect how girls view themselves, and they affect confidence, and confidence is the key to everything.” For something that has over 5,000 slang terms (shark week, Bloody Mary, red wedding), the period is one of the most ignored human rights issues around the globe—affecting everything from education and economics to the environment and public health—but that’s finally starting to change. In the past year, there have been so many pop culture moments around menstruation that NPR called 2015 “the year of the period,” and Cosmopolitan said it was “the year the period went public.” We’ll never have gender equality if we don’t talk about periods, but 2016 signaled the beginning of something better than talk: It’s becoming the year of menstrual change. There’s a movement—propelled by activists, inventors, politicians, startup founders and everyday people—to strip menstruation of its stigma and ensure that public policy keeps up. For the first time, Americans are talking about gender equality, feminism and social change through women’s periods, which, as Steinem puts it, is “evidence of women taking their place as half the human race.” Mon, a child sex worker in Cambodia, is forced to service customers every day; she only gets time off during her period. Q. Sakamaki/Redux #HappyToBleed Menstruation wasn’t always so taboo. In ancient and matrilineal cultures, it was a mark of honor and power, a sacred time for women to rest and revive their bodies. Today, no one is going to the spa or taking a few days off of work to celebrate her period. Menstruation has been cloaked in shame for centuries, but that silence was broken for a brief moment in 1970 when Dr. Edgar Berman, a member of the Democratic Party’s Committee on National Priorities, suggested that women could not hold office because of their “raging hormonal imbalances.” His comments were directed at U.S. Representative Patsy Mink of Hawaii, who had implored her party to focus on women’s issues. Berman asked people to imagine a “menopausal woman president who had to make the decision of the Bay of Pigs,” or the president of a bank “making a loan under these raging hormonal influences.” Mink ridiculed his “disgusting performance,” forced his resignation—and, for a very brief time, women’s periods had the floor. Then 46 years went by without any change. In January, President Barack Obama may have become the first president to discuss menstruation when 27-year-old YouTube sensation Ingrid Nilsen asked him why tampons and pads are taxed as luxury items in 40 states. Obama was stunned. “I have to tell you, I have no idea why states would tax these as luxury items,” he said. “I suspect it’s because men were making the laws when those taxes were passed.” Nilsen’s interview went viral, as has her frank approach to one of the most whispered-about issues in American culture and politics: menstruation . “Something that affects people every single day the president didn’t know about! And it’s because it’s one of those things that just gets buried,” she says. “That’s a reflection of how women’s bodies are viewed even today by our government and society.” If pop culture is your barometer, periods broke into late-night TV in February when Samantha Bee went on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and riffed on all the ways a female comedian can refer to her “bathing suit area,” as Colbert put it. Bee was just days away from becoming the only woman in late night TV with her show, Full Frontal With Samantha Bee. After reminding Colbert just how much he enjoys talking about the male anatomy (“caucus,” “huevos rancheros,” “Penissippi”), she offered her own list of euphemisms for lady parts, including “Department of the Interior,” “the place where I keep my keys” and “the velour bouncy castle.” Bee’s bit about “hoo-hos” and “ha-has” didn’t come out of nowhere. Over the last year, a steady stream of pop culture moments propelled menstrual equity—aka period feminism, bathroom equality or simply “life,” as Steinem quips to Newsweek—into the mainstream. Musician Kiran Gandhi ran the 2015 London Marathon without a pad or tampon, crossing the finish line with a large red stain between her legs. When artist Rupi Kaur posted a photo of herself on Instagram, fully-clothed and with a stain on her pants and sheets, the image was “accidentally” taken down. Twice. Comedy Central pair Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele schooled men on periods: “What if we told y’all that once a month, half the human race is in pain? And the other half don’t wanna hear shit about it?” Donald Trump must have missed that skit, because he spawned the hashtag #PeriodsAreNotAnInsult when he complained about tough questions from GOP debate moderator Megyn Kelly, saying she had “blood coming out of her wherever.” From awareness-raising hashtag campaigns (#TheHomelessPeriod, #HappyToBleed, #FreeTheTampons) to a Change.org petition to lift the tampon tax to 20-year-old Arushi Dua asking Mark Zuckerberg to launch an “On my period” button on Facebook to help fight menstrual stigmas in India, periods are having a moment. Kiran Gandhi drew headlines in 2015, when she had her period while running the London Marathon. Rather than stopping or trying to cover up the blood running down her leg, Gandhi kept racing, telling critics later, "women's bodies don't exist for public consumption." Kiran Gandhi This movement has been so widespread that Whoopi Goldberg is now launching a line of medical marijuana products to ease menstrual cramps. Women are using their periods to protest Indiana Governor Mike Pence’s extreme anti-abortion legislation, calling, emailing and tweeting him with detailed updates on their daily flow. Jennifer Lawrence answered the ubiquitous “Who are you wearing?” question with a story about menstruation, telling Harper’s Bazaar that she chose her red cutout Dior gown for the 2016 Golden Globes because the show coincided with her period and she wanted something that was “loose at the front…. The other dress was really tight, and I’m not going to suck in my uterus.” @GovPenceIN @periodsforpence Started my cycle today. When will you be by to check my used pads for HB1337 compliance so I know to be home?— Sasha P (@Sasha827) April 6, 2016 It Absorbs the Worry…Then Kills You U.S. consumers spent $3.1 billion on tampons, pads and sanitary panty liners last year, according to Euromonitor, and the global sanitary protection products market reached $30 billion. Y et in the last century, there have only been three significant innovations in the field: disposable sanitary pads, first marketed in the late 19th century and updated with adhesive in 1969; commercial tampons in the 1930s; and menstrual cups, which became popular in the 1980s. “If this isn’t a reflection of how women’s bodies are viewed, I don’t know what is!” says Nilsen. “How could something this important not change over 40 to 50 years?” Before pads and tampons, women folded soft gauze or flannels and pinned them to their undergarments when they had their periods (“on the rag”). All that changed in the 1920s with Kotex sanitary pads, although they were only a cosmetic improvement. “They’d move, shift, chafe. People talked about getting their skin rubbed raw,” says Vostral. “There were big tabs, and you needed an elastic belt. You had to do gymnastics to get them on.” In 1931, a Denver physician named Earle Cleveland Haas invented the modern tampon and cardboard applicator. (He also invented the diaphragm.) As women pursued more physically demanding jobs during World War II, their need for comfortable, discreet, reliable products grew. Between 1937 and 1943, tampons sales increased five-fold, and 25 percent of women regularly used tampons in the early 1940s. Mainstream American culture gradually embraced fem-care products. Women started using tampons more than pads, and feminists heralded the tampon as a liberator. “No one was thinking about safety hazards. They were just grateful to have a product that plugs it up, literally,” says Chris Bobel, president of the Society for Menstrual Cycle Research and an associate professor of women’s and gender studies at the University of Massachusetts Boston. It was only in fringe, arty circles that people were pushing boundaries on tampon etiquette; feminist artist Judy Chicago’s 1971 “Red Flag” captured a grainy, close-up shot of Chicago pulling a bloody tampon out of her vagina. (Many assumed they were looking at a bloody penis, proving her point about period taboos.) In 1975, Procter & Gamble began test-marketing a tea bag-shaped, super-absorbent tampon called Rely (tagline: “It even absorbs the worry”). They were made of synthetic materials, and the key ingredient was carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), a compound that boosted absorption so much that the tampon could theoretically last for an entire period. “I’ve talked to many people anecdotally who said, ‘I loved those tampons!’ It was a fabulous new design,” Vostral says. But others found Rely tampons painful to remove: “They absorbed so much fluid that they ripped the internal vaginal skin when you pulled them out.” Another problem: The teeth at the tip of the plastic applicator sometimes cut women. They were also potentially lethal: CMC and polyester in tampons dried out women’s vaginas, creating the ideal breeding ground for the toxin-producing bacteria Staphylococcus aureus. In 1980, 890 cases of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and 91 percent of them were related to menstruation. Thirty-eight women died. At the time, around 70 percent of American women were using tampons, and while Rely had one-quarter of the market, it was responsible for 75 percent of TSS cases, prompting widespread panic. Other super-absorbent tampon brands were implicated, including Playtex and Tampax, but Rely was the only one recalled in September 1980. All tampon manufacturers faced lawsuits over TSS, but over 1,100 were leveled against P&G. In 1982, the FDA required tampon manufacturers to warn consumers about the link between tampon use and TSS. By June 1983, the CDC had learned about 2,204 cases of TSS. It wasn’t until 1989 that the FDA required manufacturers to standardize tampon absorbency levels and include warnings on tampon boxes. In the 1980s and ’90s, the safety profile of tampons improved and the incidence of TSS plummeted, but there were still 636 cases of menstrual-related TSS between 1987 and 1996, according to the CDC, 36 of them fatal. While CMC was no longer used in tampons, an explosive 1995 Village Voice article revealed a new threat: Dioxin, a carcinogen that’s “toxic to the immune system” and linked to birth defects, had been found in some commercial tampons. The article slammed the FDA for sitting on memos revealing this link and for not testing tampons. Kaur says she created her photo project to demystify the period and make something that is innate "normal" again. Women's health and menstruation have taken center stage in recent years as activists empowered by social media spur conversation. Rupi Kaur and Prabh Kaur In a small victory for activists, the tampon industry reformed some bleaching practices to reduce the dioxin risk to trace levels, but problems remain. The FDA does not require companies to disclose the ingredients in tampons and pads, which means we know more about where our clothes are made than we do about what women put inside their vaginas. The average woman uses about 12,000 tampons in her lifetime, and that’s a conservative estimate, says Philip Tierno, a professor of microbiology at New York University School of Medicine who was among the first to link TSS with the synthetic materials in tampons. “The FDA says dioxin is a trace, but it adds up when you’re talking about decades of use.” Viscose rayon, which is made from sawdust, is still used in tampons. As Tierno puts it, “it turns out to be one of the best of the bad ingredients.” “We don’t have good, reliable data that tells us the things we’re putting inside our body, in the most absorbent part of our body, for days at a time, for 40 years, are safe or not,” says Bobel. “It’s symptomatic of the silence around menstruation.” In 1997, U.S. Representative Carolyn Maloney of New York introduced the Tampon Safety and Research Act (now the Robin Danielson Feminine Hygiene Product Safety Act, named for a woman who died of TSS in 1998) to require the National Institutes of Health to research the health risks associated with menstrual hygiene products, as well as urge the FDA to disclose the list of ingredients in tampons, pads and other period supplies. Since then, she has reintroduced the bill eight times; it’s currently sitting with the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health. “It is very difficult to get a bill passed, especially when it concerns women’s health. The safety of tampons is not something that is on the minds of many members of Congress,” says Maloney, speaking through a spokesperson. “I believe one day we’ll get this legislation passed.” Until then, startups like Lola and Conscious Period offer women what Big Business doesn’t: transparency. Commercial tampons are made of some combination of cotton, rayon and synthetic fibers, but Lola tampons are made from 100 percent natural cotton. “In the absence of real hard, current data, we’d rather put something that we understand in our bodies,” says Jordana Kier, who co-founded the company with Alex Friedman. Since launching last year, Lola has raised $4.2 million and attracted tens of thousands of customers. One box of 18 tampons costs $10 (or two for $18) and can be customized by how many light-, regular- and super-absorbency tampons a customer wants. Conscious Period sells nontoxic, 100 percent organic, hypoallergenic, biodegradable cotton tampons. Cotton is the third-most sprayed crop in the world, co-founder Margo Lang explains, but the organic cotton in Conscious Period’s tampons is free of chemicals, dyes and synthetics. They cost $8.50 for a box of 20, and for each box sold, they give a box of organic pads to a homeless woman. (No, pads aren’t the cheap way out. Homeless women say pads are easier for them to change, can be used longer and pose fewer health risks.) “Not all women are susceptible to TSS, but they have to be aware that it’s a possibility with any tampon. I’d put my money on 100 percent cotton, no synthetics,” says Tierno. “All cotton provides the lowest risk, whether organic or nonorganic, but manufacturers refuse to go to all cotton because they’d have to adjust all their machines.” If you’d rather keep things on the outside, Vancouver, British Columbia–based Lunapads sells menstrual pads, panty liners and underwear for periods, pregnancy and light bladder leakage, as well as the Diva Cup. “Lots of brands are now making products that are organic and all cotton,” says Nilsen. “If they can do it, everyone else can do it too.” ‘Free for All, All the Time’ Across the U.S., you can buy food, doodads and necessities without being taxed: Pop-Tarts in California, BBQ sunflower seeds in Indiana, Mardi Gras beads in Louisiana, Bibles in Maine and coffins in Mississippi. But in these and 35 other states, menstrual products are taxed anywhere from 4 to 10 percent. “The tampon tax is part of an overall economic system in which the dry cleaner charges more for a blouse than a shirt—in which men are assumed to be buying necessities and women are assumed to be buying luxuries,” Steinem says. Of the 10 states that don’t tax tampons, five have no sales tax (Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon) and five have specifically exempted menstrual products (Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey and Pennsylvania). This year, Chicago removed the city’s sales tax on these products. Earlier this month in New York state, the Senate joined the Assembly in unanimously passing legislation to eliminate the tampon tax; once the minor differences in those bills are aligned, the legislation will go to the governor for his signature. In New Jersey, a bill was recently introduced that would add menstrual cramps to the list of qualifying conditions for medical marijuana. Last summer, Canada axed its national goods and services tax on period products, and the U.K. and France, among other countries, are working to reduce or end the tampon tax. 40 of the 50 U.S. states tax menstrual products. Hover over each state to reveal items that are exempted from sales tax in these states. Click to enlarge. Guardian columnist and Feministing founder Jessica Valenti wrote one of the first high-profile critiques of the tax in her 2014 piece “The Case for Free Tampons,” where she charged that “women’s feminine hygiene products should be free for all, all the time.” Horrified conservatives fired back: If women had access to free tampons, what would come next—cars and food? Don’t you want the government out of your uterus? Some have professed concerns about theft (girls will steal all the tampons!), vandalism (girls will stick pads everywhere!) and recouping lost revenues. “These are excuses,” says New York City Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras-Copeland, who introduced a New York City bill aiming to put free tampons and pads in all public school bathrooms, homeless shelters and prisons. “You'll never walk into a bathroom in a public office without toilet paper. You’d be like, ‘What the hell?’… I have yet to hear someone say, ‘Well, what’s the budget on all these [free] condoms?’” California Assembly members Cristina Garcia and Ling Ling Chang introduced a bill in January to exempt women’s menstrual products from sales tax. If it passes, women in that state will have $20 million back in their wallets—the equivalent of just one-hundredth of 1 percent of California’s state budget, says Garcia, who has gone from being mocked as “Miss Flow” and “Miss Maxi” to adding 30 co-authors to the bill, including men and women from both parties. “California is a pretty blue state. When I first introduced the bill, my progressive colleagues shut me down,” she says. “We’re talking about blood, but I can’t even say that out loud because it makes them so uncomfortable and squeamish. The closest I get to the word ‘blood’ is reminding them it’s not a blue liquid…. It’s taken a lot of work and hand-holding.” This year, U.S. Representative Grace Meng of New York persuaded the Federal Emergency Management Agency to allow homeless shelters to buy feminine hygiene products with federal grant funds. She’s also working to ensure women can buy menstrual products with their flexible spending accounts. In Columbus, Ohio, Councilwoman Elizabeth Brown wants to put menstrual products in pools and recreational centers. Michigan, Virginia and Wisconsin are among the other states that have introduced legislation to eliminate the tampon tax. In Utah, an all-male panel voted 8-3 against the proposed Hygiene Tax Act. In Tennessee, a similar bill was rejected. “Anyone who doesn’t think the tampon tax is a problem either isn’t a woman or hasn’t been poor,” says Jennifer Weiss-Wolf, a vice president of the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law and leading writer and advocate for menstrual equity. She’s been an architect of the U.S. policy campaign to squash the tampon tax. As she wrote in the 2015 book Legal Change: Lessons From America’s Social Movements, real, lasting social change requires more than just viral videos: “It is necessary to win in the court of public opinion and to win in a court of law.” The tampon tax is well on its way out. Since the start of 2016, 14 states have introduced tampon tax legislation, and those efforts are still alive in 12 states. “That’s 14 of 40 states—a third! That’s also really fast,” Weiss-Wolf says. “Name another issue in this country that has bipartisan support in such a bold, open way.” The Nike of Menses “I’m wearing the boy shorts!” Miki Agrawal says, standing up and pulling down her form-fitting houndstooth pants to reveal sleek black underwear. We’re sitting in Agrawal’s tiny office at the Center for Social Innovation in downtown Manhattan. Photos of grapefruits hang from the walls and colorful underpants hang from a rack dangling above our heads. They look like they could be the latest style of Calvins, but they’re Thinx, the high-tech, period-proof underwear Agrawal invented with her twin sister, Radha, and their friend Antonia Saint Dunbar. Thinx underwear absorb the blood from a woman’s period so she doesn’t have to wear a pad or tampon (except on her heaviest days, when an extra layer of protection is recommended). Agrawal explains that her patented underwear are anti-microbial, moisture-wicking and leak-proof, keeping women feeling dry, and can absorb up to two tampons’ worth of blood. That means more comfort, fewer tampons and less pollution: “There are over 20 million combined tampon applicators, pads and menstrual products that end up in a landfill every year,” she says. Thinx come in six styles and cost $24 to $38 a pair. They’re washable, reusable and, according to the many journalists who’ve tried them, they work. Thinx donates a portion of every sale to the Uganda-based AfriPads, which teaches women to make and sell reusable pads. Agrawal is also launching Thinx Global Girls Clubs, which will give out subsidized menstrual products and teach health education, self-defense and entrepreneurship. The original THINX ads were rejected as offensive, and the company can’t get on morning TV because people don’t want to hear the word “period” over the airwaves. Thinx Agrawal came up with the idea in 2010, when she met a 12-year-old girl in South Africa. “I asked her why she wasn’t in school, and what she said to me completely changed my life. She said, ‘It’s my week of shame,’” Agrawal recalls. The girl explained that when she gets her period, she stays home from school. “I tried using leaves and mud and plastic bags and old bits of mattresses and old rags,” Agrawal remembers her saying. “None of it worked, and eventually I just stopped going.” Agrawal leans back in her chair and sticks her hand in a bag of popcorn. “There’s a period problem in the first world and a period problem in the developing world. Why no innovation? Why is no one talking about it?” While Thinx and other like-minded startups, like Dear Kate, are giving menstrual products their first real makeover in half a century, prudish mindsets are making it hard to progress past all the blue liquid. When Thinx submitted an ad campaign to New York’s subways—featuring modestly posed models in underwear and tank tops alongside artful images of juicy grapefruits and falling egg yolks—the reviewing agency, Outfront Media, called the images “inappropriate.” Thinx eventually made it to subway walls, yet Agrawal says the company has been r ejected by New York City Taxi TV and elevator bank TVs. “ We can’t be on morning talk shows,” she adds. “They don’t want to say ‘period.’ It’s nuts!” Colombian-born Diana Sierra is waging her own fight for menstrual progress by designing underwear that directly responds to the needs of girls and women in developing countries. A couple of years ago, Sierra left her industrial design job at Panasonic when, surrounded by facial steams and massage machines, she realized she was designing “for the 10 percent of people who can pay for this stuff. Ninety percent of the population are worthy of good products, but they don’t have this income, so they’re not seen as a good market,” she says. In 2014, she launched Be Girl, a design company that creates high-performance menstrual pads and underwear. She got the idea during a United Nations internship in rural Uganda, where she taught locals how to turn arts and crafts into businesses. “I had 11- and 12-year-old girls knocking on the door saying they wanted to be part of the workshop.” A teacher explained why they weren’t in school—they were menstruating. Stunned, Sierra hacked sanitary pads using material from an umbrella and mosquito net. “I come from a developing country, so we’re super-resourceful,” she says. Sierra’s parents were farmers (her father now works in construction, her mother in elder care), but thanks to a scholarship for students from “tough economic backgrounds,” she went to college and got an internship in New York City. She then spent 12 years working at leading global companies like Smart Design, Nike and LG. Sierra knew girls in Uganda used pieces of cloth to absorb their period blood, so she built underwear with a leak-proof mesh pocket that can be filled with cloth or other clean materials. Since last year, BeGirl has distributed over 15,000 pairs of reusable underwear in Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania, Malawi and 10 other countries. Be Girl underwear are as bright and cheerful as Victoria’s Secret intimates, and for each sale, the company donates a pair to a girl in need. “You cannot assume just because someone has low income, someone has low expectations or low aspirations,” she says. “I want to be the Nike of menstrual health…. It’s not just giving a girl a panty or pad. It’s giving knowledge, so she can own her body and make informed decisions.” While sifting through survey results from product pilot tests, Sierra found a dusty page from a girl in Mbola, Tanzania. Answering the question, “What do you like most about the menstrual pads?” the girl wrote that she was “so happy because she knew someone somewhere loved her,” Sierra recalls, “because that person made something so beautiful that she was so proud to be girl.” And so the name of Sierra’s company was born. “Here you have a girl continents away telling you that something as simple as a sanitary pad is giving her...a sense of dignity and pride,” she says. “Being able to run, walk with confidence, be comfortable and clean…. That’s all you want as a designer, that assurance that what you’re doing matters.” Education about menstruation is sorely lacking all over the world, depriving many women of the vital information they need to properly take control of their bodies. Ruth Fremson/The New York Times/Redux The Menstruating Man Organic and all-natural cotton tampons shouldn’t be a first-world privilege, but they are, and the fight against tampon taxes, while worthy, doesn’t matter if tampons aren’t available where you live and your culture shuns menstruation. In many countries, periods are like curses. Girls and women cannot cook, touch the water supply or spend time in places of worship or public areas when they’re menstruating. In Africa, one in 10 girls misses school during her period every month. Seventy percent of girls in India have not heard about menstruation before getting their periods, and four in five girls in East Africa lack access to sanitary pads and related health education. In Nepal, some rural families still follow an ancient tradition called chaupadi, banishing girls and women to sheds when they have their period. “Most girls learn about their periods the day their periods start,” says Chandra-Mouli of the WHO. He recounts a story he hears time after time: “I started having periods at school. Spotting on my clothes. Giggling in class. I didn’t know what was happening. My panties felt wet. My teacher made me wait in the staff room. I thought my insides were rotting. My mother came and wrapped me in a towel, took me home, put me in a bath and said, ‘You’re a woman now. Don’t go out and play with the boys.’” These systemic issues won’t be solved with a pair of high-tech underwear. “I spent time in Uganda, Kenya and India shadowing organizations working to address these issues,” says Bobel of the Society for Menstrual Cycle Research. “They understand there is no silver bullet, but it’s a material solution that funders love, and it’s concrete and scalable. What’s not getting challenged is the actual culture of menstrual secrecy and shame.” If product is the sexy solution, the practical path ahead is also the harder one: “Figure out low-cost, sustainable infrastructure solutions,” says Marni Sommer, an associate professor of sociomedical sciences at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health who’s been studying global menstruation for a decade. “If you can break taboos and start getting info to girls and transform some infrastructure so there are safe, private places to manage without worry about being attacked, embarrassed or dirty, that will make a big difference.” The shaming and isolation of women and girls having their periods are still common practice in many parts of the world, from India to Indiana. Navesh Chitrakar/Reuters A man known as India’s Menstrual Man is chipping away at this problem. Arunachalam Muruganantham grew up in south India, the son of poor handloom weavers. In 1998, soon after marrying his wife, he realized she was using soiled cloths to manage her period. When she explained that she couldn’t afford to buy sanitary pads as well as milk for their family, he decided to do something. For years, he experimented with materials and prototypes. He tried to convince his wife to test his products, then he asked local medical students, but they all refused, so Muruganantham tested the sanitary pads himself. He filled a rubber bladder with animal blood, attached a tube that led into his underwear, and spent five days wearing a pad. “The messy days, the lousy days, that wetness. My God, it’s unbelievable,” he said in his 2012 TEDx Bangalore talk. After six years of research, he built a machine that makes sterilized sanitary napkins—but not before his neighbors thought he’d lost his mind and his wife left him (they’re now back together). Today, he has 2,500 machines in India and a few hundred across 17 other countries. His pads retail for 3 cents a packet, and the machines cost $2,500 each, both below market rates. In 2014, Muruganantham was named one of Time ’s 100 most influential people in the world, and his machines have enabled women to launch their own businesses. As he puts it, “by the women, for the women, to the women.” Swati Bedekar, a scientist from Gujarat, India, bought one of Muruganantham’s machines in 2010 after visiting desert communities and witnessing girls sitting on stones or pots filled with sand to catch the blood from their periods. She wanted to help them, but the women who used her machine complained that the foot pedal led to back pain. So Bedekar tweaked the machine, simplifying the process, altering the design of the pads and adding wings for comfort. Yet there was another barrier: In most Indian cities and villages, there are no regulations for waste disposal, and used sanitary products are often wrapped in paper or some kind of plastic and thrown out with the trash. Stray dogs often rummage through the waste, and some men worry that women might use the pads for black magic. Bedekar’s husband, Shyam, invented a terra-cotta incinerator that looked like a garden pot and could burn used pads discreetly, quickly and without electricity. Today, Bedekar has 40 groups of women using her revamped machine to make and sell 50,000 pads a month under the name Sakhi (it means “friend” in Hindi). Inspired by the Ice Bucket Challenge, a fundraising campaign for Lou Gehrig’s disease that went viral in 2014, Bedekar launched the Hygiene Bucket Challenge, where she asked people to buy a bucket’s worth of Sakhi supplies. With the help of her nonprofit Vatsalya Foundation, she gave 6,000 girls a year’s supply of menstrual products in 2015. While much of the innovation in India focuses on small businesses, ZanaAfrica Foundation provides sanitary pads and reproductive health education to 10,000 girls across Kenya each year. In 2004, Kenya became the first country in the world to eliminate sales tax on menstrual products, but there is still much work to be done. “Menstruation contributes to 1 million adolescent girls in Kenya missing up to six weeks of school each year,” says Gina Reiss-Wilchins, CEO of ZanaAfrica Foundation. “They’re dropping out of school at two times the rate of boys starting at puberty.” In March, the foundation’s social enterprise arm, ZanaAfrica Group, which manufactures menstrual products for girls and women in East Africa, received a four-year $2.6 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to fund a groundbreaking study examining the impact of providing pads along with girl-centered reproductive health information. “If every girl in Kenya finished secondary school, there would be a 46 percent increase in the country’s [GDP] across her lifetime. There are so many barriers: poverty, abuse, child marriage, pregnancy. Getting your period should not be a barrier,” says Reiss-Wilchins. “We are a quiet little revolution.” Request Reprint or Submit Correction Related Stories U.S. Five Women Sue to End New York ‘Tampon Tax’ The lawsuit claims New York state collects $14 million in...

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 8 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Pampers Swaddlers Names Winners of the 2017 Thank You Nurses Awards CINCINNATI–(BUSINESS WIRE)–To celebrate Nurse Appreciation Week, Pampers Swaddlers, the #1 Choice of U.S. Hospitals*, announces the winners of the Thank You Nurses awards. Developed with the Association of Women’s Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN) and the National Association of Neonatal Nurses (NANN), this award honors nurses who go above and beyond through the touches of love they give to babies and their parents across three care categories: Labor & Delivery, Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and Postpartum. Out of more than 3,000 nominations, the stories of Laurie Milliken of Washington Township, NJ, Elizabeth Giambrone of New Orleans, LA, and Billie Warren of Wheat Ridge, CO rose to the top. Laurie Milliken made the selfless decision to give up time with her own family during the holidays and stay well beyond her shift to be by her patient’s side during 17 hours of labor. Billie Warren connected with one new mom who was unable to share in the birth of her baby with her own mother. And, Elizabeth Giambrone helped one family find comfort, and even some laughter, through their baby’s journey with multiple surgeries and 130 days in the NICU. “Their beautiful stories of guiding parents through the onset of their newborn’s delivery and postpartum care were heartfelt, unique and what being a nurse is all about,” said Lori Brittingham, President of the National Association of Neonatal Nurses. “We look forward to honoring these stand-out nurses for all they’ve done for patients with the prestigious recognition of the Thank You Nurses Award at this year’s AWHONN convention,” added AWHONN CEO Lynn Erdman, MN, RN, FAAN. This year’s winners will receive a one-year membership to AWHONN or NANN, including attendance at the respective organization’s annual convention, a $5,000 scholarship, a P&G care package, commemorative plaque and more. AWHONN and Pampers Swaddlers have also awarded three additional scholarships to help minority nurses complete their studies toward a Master of Science in Nursing. Anita MacInnis from Healdsburg, CA, Essence Williams from Crum Lynne, PA and Ludrena Rodriguez from Mililani, HI were recognized for their career accomplishments, superior academic achievements and involvement in AWHONN to help in advancing the nursing field. “Pampers is dedicated to every baby’s happy, healthy development, and has been trusted by nurses since the brand began working closely with hospitals 40 years ago,” said E.

(Photo: Business Wire) Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail May 08, 2017 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--To celebrate Nurse Appreciation Week, Pampers Swaddlers, the #1 Choice of U.S. Hospitals*, announces the winners of the Thank You Nurses awards. Developed with the Association of Women’s Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN) and the National Association of Neonatal Nurses (NANN), this award honors nurses who go above and beyond through the touches of love they give to babies and their parents across three care categories: Labor & Delivery, Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and Postpartum. Out of more than 3,000 nominations, the stories of Laurie Milliken of Washington Township, NJ, Elizabeth Giambrone of New Orleans, LA, and Billie Warren of Wheat Ridge, CO rose to the top. Laurie Milliken made the selfless decision to give up time with her own family during the holidays and stay well beyond her shift to be by her patient’s side during 17 hours of labor. Billie Warren connected with one new mom who was unable to share in the birth of her baby with her own mother. And, Elizabeth Giambrone helped one family find comfort, and even some laughter, through their baby’s journey with multiple surgeries and 130 days in the NICU. “Their beautiful stories of guiding parents through the onset of their newborn’s delivery and postpartum care were heartfelt, unique and what being a nurse is all about,” said Lori Brittingham, President of the National Association of Neonatal Nurses. “We look forward to honoring these stand-out nurses for all they’ve done for patients with the prestigious recognition of the Thank You Nurses Award at this year’s AWHONN convention,” added AWHONN CEO Lynn Erdman, MN, RN, FAAN. This year’s winners will receive a one-year membership to AWHONN or NANN, including attendance at the respective organization’s annual convention, a $5,000 scholarship, a P&G care package, commemorative plaque and more. AWHONN and Pampers Swaddlers have also awarded three additional scholarships to help minority nurses complete their studies toward a Master of Science in Nursing. Anita MacInnis from Healdsburg, CA, Essence Williams from Crum Lynne, PA and Ludrena Rodriguez from Mililani, HI were recognized for their career accomplishments, superior academic achievements and involvement in AWHONN to help in advancing the nursing field. “Pampers is dedicated to every baby’s happy, healthy development, and has been trusted by nurses since the brand began working closely with hospitals 40 years ago,” said E. Yuri Hermida, Vice President, North America Baby Care, P&G. “This long-standing relationship and respect for nurses is why Pampers launched the Thank You Nurses program in 2015 and why we continue to work closely with hospitals and nurses to improve our products.” In 2016, Pampers introduced the new Pampers Preemie Swaddlers Size P-3 diaper, designed in partnership with NICU nurses for the most vulnerable premature babies weighing as little as 1 pound (500 grams).

Nehemiah Manufacturing provides extensive on-the-job training to all employees. Michael Taylor is operations manager with Nehemiah Manufacturing. More than 60% of Nehemiah Manufacturing's workforce have been previously been in prison. By Parija Kavilanz NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Michael Taylor has been promoted seven times in five years at Nehemiah Manufacturing, a Cincinnati company that makes household and person care products. Before the company brought him on, he couldn't land a job anywhere. "Employers would run a background check on me and back out," he said. But at Nehemiah, he's one of at least 60 workers who have one thing in common -- a criminal record. Taylor has battled drug and alcohol addiction and been to rehab more than once. In his 20s, he did prison time for his involvement in a burglary. In a way, that made him just what Dan Meyer, the company's owner, was looking for. Eight years ago, Meyer had an idea: He could combine his 30 years experience in the industry -- he was an executive at Procter & Gamble and had launched and sold two consumer-product startups -- with a social mission. He set up in a 30,000-square-foot building in a neighborhood then struggling with severe unemployment. And the company set out to hire people with felony convictions or experience with addiction. Nehemiah makes products under its own brand names, like Boogie Wipes for kids' noses, and licenses others, including some of Procter & Gamble's Downy and Febreze products. Meyer, who was raised Catholic, named the business after a figure in the Old Testament who helped repair and rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. Today the company has three facilities, all in some of the poorest sections of Cincinnati. The business pulls in $50 million in annual revenue and employs 110 people in all. But Meyer is proudest of what he calls his second-chance employees. "We've given them a chance and found them to be hidden gems and among our most loyal employees," said Meyer. The stigma of a criminal conviction makes finding a job tough. According to the National Employment Law Project, an employment rights advocacy group, the chance of finding work drops as much as 50%. Access to a steady job, though, can reduce the chance of a second offense by 31%, according to a study by the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a public policy think tank. At Nehemiah, these employees are offered temporary jobs first. They start on the factory floor taking products off the conveyor belt and loading them onto pallets. Taylor, 34, went through three weeks of training, then started on the floor at $8.75 an hour. He was promoted to operating a forklift, then to product supervisor, and eventually to operations manager. He makes $70,000 a year and oversees most of the workers at the company. "It's been a long struggle for me after prison," he said. "Everyone treats you like a loser if you've gone to prison. It's a miracle I didn't go back to drugs. Getting a chance at Nehemiah happened at the right time." Felicia Johnson, 42, is a line captain, managing six workers. She supervises product packaging and makes sure the company meets daily production targets. Before this job, she was jobless, often homeless. She found cocaine at a young age, and "my life spiraled out of control," she said. She was arrested more than once on drug charges and separated from her three children. Her turning point came eight years ago, when a drug recovery program connected her with Nehemiah. "I now have job skills, I'm responsible, and I'm a leader," she said. "I've learned my worth." Other companies have seen the value, too. A small manufacturer outside Denver called Mile High WorkShop cranks out pillows, tote bags, cutting boards and ski parts. Each of its 10 employees has a troubled past, including homelessness, drug addiction and jail time. Greyston Bakery, in Yonkers, New York, which makes brownies that go in Ben & Jerry's ice cream, has an "open hire" policy to help people get back on their feet. About 30% of the bakers have been incarcerated, struggled with addiction or had similar issues, the company says. At Nehemiah, about 40 people with troubled backgrounds turn up every month looking for work. "We can't hire them all," Meyer said. He's trying to encourage other businesses in the city to hire them, and he said 22 local companies have done it. "2,500 individuals each year leave our county jail system," Meyer said. "I want to help each one find and keep a job if they want to." TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Deputy Commerce Minister Sontirat Sontijirawong said the Internal Trade Department has been tasked with holding the joint meeting after consumers complained about being charged the same prices for products that are smaller in size or volume. The consumer goods companies and retailers include Saha Group, Unilever Thai Trading Ltd, Colgate-Palmolive Thailand, Procter & Gamble Trading Thailand, Big C Supercenter, Home Product Center Plc (the operator of HomePro stores) and Ek-chai Distribution System (the operator of Tesco Lotus hypermarkets). Mr Sontirat said preliminary inspections had found that certain brands of shower gel and liquid detergents have seen size and volume cuts while being sold at the same prices. "But in talks so far, manufacturers have said their prices remain in the range which was previously communicated to the ministry," he said. More importantly, those products are just on the Commerce Ministry's watch list, not the price control list. The price control list covers essential items for daily use such as food, consumer goods, farm-related products, paper, petroleum and medicine. Consumer goods include detergent, sanitary napkins and toilet paper. The government earlier this year raised the number of products and services on the state price control list to 47, up from 45. Delivery charges for online shopping and counter service were added to the list of expenditures that need special supervision by state officials due to growing usage. The three service items that were already on the list are commercial music copyright usage, storage and warehousing services and agricultural services. The number of products on the price control list will stay unchanged at 42. The price control list covers essential items for daily use such as food, consumer products, farm-related products (fertilisers, pesticides, animal feed, tractors and rice harvesters), construction materials, paper, petroleum and medicines. Listed foods include garlic, paddy, milled rice, corn, eggs, cassava, wheat flour, yoghurt, powdered/fresh milk, sugar, vegetable/animal oil and pork. Consumer products include detergents, sanitary napkins and toilet paper. Businesses making or selling listed products are required to inform the authorities of their production costs and seek approval before any price increases.

By Alyana Alfaro • 05/08/17 4:47pm Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen. Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen has never really broken a sweat running for re-election in the affluent Morris County suburbs that he has represented in Congress for 22 years. The 11th congressional district has the most registered Republicans in New Jersey, 164,000, and of all of Frelinghuysen’s challengers over two decades, it was a ficus tree registered by filmmaker Michael Moore as a gag that got the most attention. But since President Trump’s election in November, there is talk — somewhere between serious possibility and wishful thinking — that the deep-red district could change colors in 2018. Frelinghuysen’s vote last week in favor of a bill that cuts $880 billion from Medicaid and rewrites major parts of the Affordable Care Act will be front and center as opponents make the case against the longtime congressman, a member of the Frelinghuysen political dynasty and an heir to the Procter & Gamble fortune. For Frelinghuysen, the chair of the powerful House Appropriations Committee, the new scrutiny has come primarily from a super PAC called NJ 11th for Change, which has called on him all year to hold an in-person town hall event. On Friday, as Frelinghuysen cast a yes vote for the controversial American Health Care Act, the group held a protest outside his Morristown office. Debra Caplan, a member of NJ 11th for Change’s steering committee, said after years in Congress, Frelinghuysen is now out of touch with his constituents. Although Frelinghuysen calls himself a moderate, his votes have shifted to the right steadily over the past four years, she said. “In the wake of the 2016 election, there are a lot of people who weren’t paying attention to congressional-level politics who are now following it on a vote-by-vote basis,” she said. “The shift in his voting happened a long time ago but what’s different now is that people are paying attention. We have a mismatch between what people in this district want and how he is voting. It doesn’t take much of knowing about that for people to feel kind of betrayed.” In January, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee named the 11th district a target in the 2018 midterms. Last week, the DCCC placed Frelinghuysen on their “Retirement Watch List,” which features Republicans the group says could retire due to the “negative national environment for the Republican Party.” Frelinghuysen initially opposed an earlier draft of the AHCA this year because the Medicaid funding cuts, he said, would have harmed people in his district. But he was scolded by fellow Republicans; some suggested Frelinghuysen should lose the Appropriations gavel if he was going to buck the party leadership on big priorities such as repealing Obamacare. Last week, after several amendments that did not significantly modify the Medicaid funding reductions, Frelinghuysen switched to a yes vote. That made him one of only two New Jersey House members to support the bill, along with Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-3), the primary architect of an amendment that would allow states to set higher rates for coverage for consumers with some pre-existing conditions, among other changes. “Representative Frelinghuysen’s vote for the Republican health care bill further exposed him as a Republican ‘yes man’ out of step with his district,” said Evan Lukaske, a DCCC spokesman. “After opposing the first version of this cruel plan — which would have increased premiums on New Jersey families and kicked 24 million Americans off their healthcare — Frelinghuysen voted for it only after the bill was changed to strip protections for pre-existing conditions. Democrats have already invested in flipping this district, and we’re continuing to ramp up the pressure as Frelinghuysen pushes policies that hurt his constituents.” But, according to Montclair State University political scientist Brigid Harrison, the shift may not be imminent in 2018. “There are two guiding realities,” she said. “The first one is that in any given year on average, 95 percent of all House members win re-election. That is an almost insurmountable obstacle. The other part of that is that New Jersey’s congressional districts tend to be very strongly partisan gerrymandered and 11 is one of those districts.” If Frelinghuysen was truly vulnerable, she said, he might not have voted for the AHCA. “He is going to get a lot of guff, there are going to be protests, it is going to be uncomfortable, his margin of victory will certainly decrease, but the reality is they thought he was safe enough that he would win re-election,” she said. State Assemblyman John McKeon (D-Essex) went to Washington, D.C., last week to meet with DCCC members about a potential challenge to Frelinghuysen. It could be a long shot, but there is precedent for such challenges to be successful, Harrison said. She pointed to congressional races in 1974 and 1994 — both of them “wave elections” in which national politics shifted control of the House, even swinging some districts where incumbents had won previously by comfortable margins. Frelinghuysen’s district has shifted to the left after a 2011 redistricting that brought part of Essex County — including potions of liberal Montclair — into the fold. But it has remained reliably Republican in recent elections. In 2012, Barack Obama lost the district by 5 points. In November, Hillary Clinton lost to Trump by 1 point. A report issued last week by the Cook Political Report identified two New Jersey districts currently represented by Republicans — Leonard Lance (R-7) and MacArthur (R-3) — as moving slightly to the left after the health care vote. But there was no movement for Frelinghuysen, whose seat is designated “likely Republican.” SEE ALSO: Anti-AHCA Protesters Rally as Frelinghuysen Casts Yes Vote New Jersey Politics Observer Delivered to Your Inbox Sign Up Submit Must Reads Observer Politics Entertainment Lifestyle Arts Health Contact About Newsletters Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP We noticed you're using an ad blocker.

News Culture Cityscape Politics History Biking Environment Transit LGBTQ Newsletters Support Us May 8, 2017 at 3:30 pm news From Saudi Arabia to Toronto in Search of a Homeland; “We Love It Here” For Ehab Jaber and his family, immigration to Canada happened very quickly. By Stephen Thomas, and Ehab Jaber My parents were displaced in 1948 when Israel was created. My dad was eight and my mom was four. They grew up as refugees with no citizenship. My dad became a doctor, but non-citizens weren’t allowed to work in Lebanon. So he got a job offer in Dharan, Saudi Arabia. But he needed a passport. So he went to the post office and sent a telegram to the King of Jordan and said, “I’m Palestinian, I’m a refugee, I’m a doctor, I need a passport.” The post office thought he was crazy. But Jordan gave him citizenship by royal decree. I was born in Dharan in 1970. But I’m not a Saudi citizen. From a young age I went to American schools in Saudi Arabia, then I went to the U.S. for high school and university. When I was 14, my dad dropped me off at a boarding school in Massachusetts. After university I was going to do a masters in education, and I started it, but after a few months I decided it wasn’t right for me and I went home. To Saudi Arabia. To my parents. I applied for teaching jobs, but by a fluke, a cousin recommended I apply to a company called Proctor & Gamble, in marketing. I said, sure, whatever. And I got it. My first job with P&G was in Jeddah, on the Red Sea. During that time I realized that although it was comfortable, that place was not where I wanted to spend the rest of my life. Like my parents in Dhahran, I lived in company-subsidized expat compounds, in these beautiful suburban homes, almost for free. But I didn’t live with the Saudi people. I didn’t feel a sense of belonging. I didn’t feel like a citizen. I wasn’t a citizen. I was an expat. I longed to live somewhere I could call my country, where I’d be respected, and would have respect for me, and human rights, and I could buy my own house. Then I got married, and my wife felt the same way. So we applied to Canada. It happened very quickly. Within a year, they sent the paperwork. I had just started working for Coca-Cola, in Cyprus, and my boss connected me with Coca-Cola in Canada. So we moved. That was 1999. It was relatively very easy for us. I had a job with Coca-Cola immediately. My wife enrolled in university at York. We immediately bought a house, a condo in North York. And then we had a son, in 2002. In 2004, my wife and I separated, and she moved back to the Middle East. So I went too, to be close to my son. But after seven years in Dhubai, he and I came back to Canada. And we love it here. I’m very proud to be Canadian and raising my son here. I became a citizen in 2003, and my son has been a citizen since birth.

Filling the skills gap is costly and engaging. FILE PHOTO | NMG  Lack of technical skills and job experience are major problems for many countries across the globe. The problems are felt most by emerging economies which have to rely on expatriates to build capacity, spur economic growth and pioneer new sectors. Companies employing expatriate labour do not do so out of choice, it is an expensive option and often exposes them to criticism. A 2013 World Bank report titled The Job Challenge shows that it has become difficult for most graduates to get jobs within their specific disciplines. Surprisingly, the main issue is not because there are too many graduates chasing few jobs, but because most graduates lack the necessary skills and experience that the job market requires. According to McKinsey, 40 per cent of employers report skills gaps in entry level vacancies, hence showing that this is a significant issue to both employers and the unemployed.  This trend is exacerbated by technological advancements which are rapidly replacing manual jobs, leaving millions of young people unprepared to participate in the 21st-century knowledge economy. So how do employers and job-seekers fill this gap today? Several remedies have been recommended in the past. Here in Kenya, a method that has worked well is the graduate trainee programme where fresh graduates are absorbed into companies. Also Read Opinion & AnalysisDonating to worthy cause will ease the tax burden Opinion & AnalysisEDITORIAL: South Africa must do all to protect every foreigner They are taken through rigorous on the job training after which they are either hired or let to go explore opportunities elsewhere. The model is used by various global companies including Procter and Gamble, PwC and Deloitte. Graduate training programmes act as a means of transferring skills and experience to workforce entrants and allow organisations to attract and identify talent. Securing technically talented and experienced staff in an emerging economy like Kenya can be difficult, particularly in newly established sectors such as the extractives sector. How have companies managed to build and develop talent locally while saving costs on expatriates? One good example of this is mining company Base Titanium. The firm has initiated various programmes to build capacity. Its programmes include a three month internship, an 18-month graduate trainee programme, an apprenticeship programme, community training, and the frontline management programme. The frontline management programme identifies outstanding employees who are trained for higher level technical or management positions. The training covers businesses operations, allowing them to gain insight and experience in and beyond their respective disciplines. This enables them to have a more holistic understanding of the company’s operations, a key requirement for management. I will focus on two of Base Titanium’s training programmes; the apprentice and the community trainee programmes. These represent practical initiatives that benefit Kenya’s youth, local communities and the company. They can also be easily adopted and rolled out across any sector. The Community Technical Training Programme was launched in December 2016 and is fully facilitated by Base Titanium. It focuses on enrolling trainees from local communities and is designed to provide basic life and computer skills, emergency response knowledge, workshop practice, first aid and occupational health and safety training. Trainees specialise in two trades; electrical wiring and arc welders. This training links academic learning to industrial needs. The trainees are later sponsored for the National Industrial Training Authority (Nita) grade exams for national certification. The trainees, about 15 by now, are Form Four graduates who were unable to proceed with their education. Base Titanium, through a partnership with Mombasa Industrial Training Centre (MITC), provides an opportunity for community members to enhance their skills at both institutions after which they sit for Nita exams. If they so wish, the trainees can proceed to the diploma level. This equips them with core skills to enter the job market. It also ensures that Base Titanium has a skilled labour pool should they expand their mining activities. On the other hand, Base Titanium’s diploma apprentices programme takes three years and targets Form Four leavers admitted in a technical training institution. The programme is meant to provide real life, on the job skills transfer during their college period. Apprentices are embedded as employees and assigned to a mentor in a given discipline depending on their course. Each intake comprises of 20 apprentices who learn the requirements of their jobs to eventually work with minimal supervision. Apprentices also attended classes at the Technical University of Mombasa (TUM). Base Titanium works closely with TUM to coordinate training. The programme is endorsed by Nita. In spite of these efforts, a lot still needs to be done to provide necessary skills to youth to ensure that they are ready for the job market. Filling the skills gap is costly and engaging. However, the private sector can impart skills that contribute to Kenya’s economic transformation through partnerships with the government and institutions such as Nita and TUM. advertisement In the Headlines Post boxes, sending letters to cost more By MUTHOKI MUMO  Pakistan overtakes Uganda as top buyer of Kenyan exports By NEVILLE OTUKI  Banks lending to Treasury up by Sh119bn from March By CHARLES MWANIKI  2 minutes ago Mombasa queries SGR land payout for fishers By DANIEL NYASSY  11  hours ago Corporate News Money & Markets Economy & Politics Opinion & Analysis Life & Style Magazines Daily Nation Daily Monitor Mwananchi Digital Editions Nation Media Group About us Contact us Help Privacy Policy Terms

Paid family leave is proven to reduce stress, increase child survival rates, improve chances of successful breastfeeding, and give mothers time to physically recover after having a baby. Yet, America is the only developed country in the world without a national policy, forcing many women to return to work before they are ready. In fact, one in four women return to work less than two weeks after giving birth. ADVERTISEMENT Consider this: just two weeks after giving birth, many women are still bleeding, experiencing physical pain, grappling with the hardships of breastfeeding, and just starting to bond with their babies.   In the absence of a federal policy, U.S. employers have stepped up to establish their own paid family leave programs. As leaders of both political parties begin to explore what a national paid family leave policy could be, they are starting to take a look at these exemplary American employers for guidance. Washington wants to know how paid leave has been good for business, grown market share, helped with retention and recruitment, and balanced the needs of our complex economy. To take part in these crucial conversations, it’s important for the wide variety of U.S. companies with strong policies to elevate their data, share employee stories, and demonstrate how paid family leave is good for their business and communities. By and large, technology giants are regarded as the drivers of the paid family leave movement. When Spotify announced their generous six-month paid parental leave policy in 2015, Chief Human Resources Officer Katarina Berg said the policy was born out of the company culture’s “emphasis on a healthy work/family balance, gender equality and the ability for every parent to spend quality time with the people that matter most in their lives.” Many of these tech companies boast remarkably flexible paid leave programs that accommodate all types of new parents, with leaders like Google and Amazon now providing at least four months of paid leave and even featuring “Ramp Back” programs for new parents easing back into the office with flexible schedules. But outside Silicon Valley — where critics often say paid leave policies are focused on solving for the lack of women in the workforce — there are hundreds of companies of varying scale and industry that provide innovative and flexible paid leave policies. In the financial services sector, Bank of America offers four months of paid maternity, paternity, and adoptive leave for full- and part-time employees, and American Express provides up to five months of paid leave and financial assistance for parents who pursue adoption or surrogacy. Johnson & Johnson, along with Procter & Gamble, provides new mothers at least four months of paid family leave. Procter & Gamble also offers four weeks of paternity leave, garnering them recognition from Fatherly.com as one of America’s best places to work for new dads. When recently rolling out a new policy of ten weeks maternity leave and two weeks paternity leave, Hilton’s Chief Human Resources Officer Matt Schuyler noted that "when our Team Members feel great about where they work, it is reflected in the exceptional experience that they provide to our guests.” Nestlé provides fourteen weeks paid leave to primary caregivers with the option of extending unpaid leave up to six months, and Anheuser-Busch gives sixteen weeks paid to mothers and up to eight weeks for primary caregivers. When launching their new policy in 2015, Paul Bakus, president of Nestlé corporate affairs, said: “Right now, I think many companies are just looking at this as a cost, and they don't have a lot of data to see it from a different vantage point. We'll be looking at whether or not the retention rates have changed over time, which we hope to be a positive outcome, and that success would encourage other companies to pile on and do this.” Energy sector leader Exelon and chemical manufacturer Dow Chemical also give new parent employees paid flexibility, and shipping companies like U-Haul continue to evolve their paid leave policies for salaried and hourly workers. Unions have begun stepping up their employee benefits programs for new parents, with the Iron Workers International Union just announcing a paid leave policy of pre-delivery benefits for six months and post-delivery paid leave up to eight weeks for new mothers. All in all, the tide is turning, and more and more industry leaders are supporting their employees and companies with paid family leave. Thanks to these private sector pioneers, a record 82 percent of Americans now say employers should provide paid leave for mothers following birth or adoption, and 69 percent say fathers should have the same. The reason is simple: these industries are some of the country’s strongest economic contributors. Each of these sectors is highly competitive, and they prioritize attracting and retaining the best talent from each of their fields. As a result, they recognize the need for flexible paid family leave policies and inspire their competitors and up-and-coming players in their industries to do the same. As policymakers take a closer look at what a federal paid leave policy could be, this diverse array of American employers must come together to advise Washington on how to shape this policy. We need the companies that employ the 14 percent of women who have paid maternity leave to show how this benefits business, grows market share, improves the lives of our people, and gives babies a healthy start to life. Leaders of American employers know: to get your voice heard, you must have a seat at the table. It’s time to speak up and prove why paid family leave is good for employees, good for business, and good for the economy.

In an article published in Restaurant Hospitality, he notes that most analytical approaches have been developed and used by academics, making many online resources difficult to decipher. To bridge the gap between academia and everyday business operators, he suggests the following (more detail on each available here): Clean data is essential for successful recommendations. Viewing analytics as a toolbox means using the right tool for the right job. Models should accurately reflect customer behavior. The result should be actions that help your business. Experts are your allies. He concludes with the following advice: “As you think about how analysis can help you get to the answers of your questions, know that there is no one-size-fits-all way to use analytics. Keeping these points in mind can help you ask the right questions and ensure that the analytics presented to you are representative of your business and useful.” Influence of Latinos on Foodservice Increases A recent study by Technomic concludes that Latinos make up 17 percent of the U.S. population and their rising spending power and taste preferences are worth watching – and responding to. “While there is now more opportunity to drive traffic and sales among Latinos, their broadening consideration set will create increased competition for their foodservice dollars,” notes Anne Mills, manager of consumer insights at Technomic. “Keeping abreast of how the Latino population is evolving, and how this impacts their patronage, need states, and preferences will help create menu, product and marketing strategies that effectively resonate with this young consumer base.” Key takeaways from the study include the following: Three in five (62%) Latinos expect their personal financial situation to improve in the next year, with 35% of these consumers saying it will improve slightly. Two in five (41%) of Latinos and 54% of Spanish-dominant Latinos say that they are now more likely to visit restaurants that publicly support Latinos compared to in 2015. About half (49%) of Latinos say loyalty/rewards programs encourage them to visit a specific restaurant over another, up from 42% in 2015. Digital Advertising’s Basic Promise Questioned by Big-Name Advertisers Last year, when Procter & Gamble’s CMO announced that the consumer products giant would be pulling back on ad targeting on Facebook, “the news led some to question the value of digital advertising’s distinguishing characteristic: its capacity to target narrow segments of the population,” writes Kate Kaye in MIT Technology Review. Digital advertising, she notes, continues to climb: eMarketer predicts a continuation of double-digit growth from $83 billion this year (or about 40% of the projected $206 billion that will be spent on all advertising in 2017) to more than $129 billion in 2021. Digital advertising experts cited in the story pointed out mistakes companies make in their online campaigns: 1) narrowly defining target audiences is still valid, but the targets must be chosen correctly (e.g., targeting 18- to 24-year-old men for fitness apparel when their mothers or wives were actually doing the buying); 2) relying too much on targeted ads and cutting back on other, broader-based efforts; and 3) hyper-targeting customers doesn’t always work. She concludes by saying, “Rather than a referendum on all digital targeting, pronouncements by companies like P&G may be a sign of maturity in the online advertising market as it assesses what this strategy can do very well and what it cannot.” How To Determine the ROI of Online Reputation Management In this short, breezy video from WebPunch’s School of Online Reputation Management, Matt Jones takes the viewer through a series of simple calculations to gauge the ROI from a brand’s efforts to maintain a positive image online. While not the definitive answer to the challenges of managing the ROI of reputation management in a world of online reviewers, the video does provide a useful point of view. Based on a study by MOZ that showed one negative search result can result in 21.9% of viewers not wanting to do business with that company, Jones worked with BrandYourself to come up with a few simple formulas to answer the following question: If you know the percentage of average lost customers, how can you extrapolate that and understand its impact on your bottom line?

In addition, Alere filed its Form 10-K for 2015 late and in March 2017, Alere received a notice from the New York Stock Exchange (the „NYSE”) that the Company is not in compliance with the NYSE’s continued listing requirements under the timely filing criteria. In August 2016, Alere filed a complaint against Abbott, seeking to compel Abbott to fulfill its obligations under the terms of the merger agreement.  Later in the year, Abbott announced that it had filed a complaint to terminate its proposed acquisition of Alere based on the substantial loss in Alere’s value following the merger agreement.   With the April 2017 announcement that the companies had agreed to amend the terms of the acquisition, Abbott and Alere are again moving forward. Their press release reported that the transaction is expected to close by the end of the third quarter of 2017, subject to the approval of Alere shareholders and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory approvals. Abbott and Alere also agreed to dismiss their respective lawsuits.  While well short of IVD leader Roche, Kalorama the renewed merger creates space between Abbott and its two rivals Danaher and Siemens Healthineers in the IVD market.      Kalorama Information’s Worldwide Market for In Vitro Diagnostics 2017: IVD Test Volumes and Pricing Analysis has projected test volumes, including share of volumes for all major companies.

Some of those risks and uncertainties are discussed in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Item 1A, Risk Factors, Page 29. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: Unusually high levels of catastrophe losses due to risk concentrations, changes in weather patterns, environmental events, terrorism incidents or other causes Increased frequency and/or severity of claims or development of claims that are unforeseen at the time of policy issuance Inadequate estimates, assumptions or reliance on third-party data used for critical accounting estimates Declines in overall stock market values negatively affecting the company's equity portfolio and book value Domestic and global events resulting in capital market or credit market uncertainty, followed by prolonged periods of economic instability or recession, that lead to: Significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of a particular security or group of securities and impairment of the asset(s) Significant decline in investment income due to reduced or eliminated dividend payouts from a particular security or group of securities Significant rise in losses from surety and director and officer policies written for financial institutions or other insured entities Prolonged low interest rate environment or other factors that limit the company's ability to generate growth in investment income or interest rate fluctuations that result in declining values of fixed-maturity investments, including declines in accounts in which we hold bank-owned life insurance contract assets Recession or other economic conditions resulting in lower demand for insurance products or increased payment delinquencies Difficulties with technology or data security breaches, including cyberattacks, that could negatively affect our ability to conduct business and our relationships with agents, policyholders and others Disruption of the insurance market caused by technology innovations such as driverless cars that could decrease consumer demand for insurance products Delays, inadequate data developed internally or from third parties, or performance inadequacies from ongoing development and implementation of underwriting and pricing methods, including telematics and other usage-based insurance methods, or technology projects and enhancements expected to increase our pricing accuracy, underwriting profit and competitiveness Increased competition that could result in a significant reduction in the company's premium volume Changing consumer insurance-buying habits and consolidation of independent insurance agencies that could alter our competitive advantages Inability to obtain adequate ceded reinsurance on acceptable terms, amount of reinsurance coverage purchased, financial strength of reinsurers and the potential for nonpayment or delay in payment by reinsurers Inability to defer policy acquisition costs for any business segment if pricing and loss trends would lead management to conclude that segment could not achieve sustainable profitability Inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends consistent with current or past levels Events or conditions that could weaken or harm the company's relationships with its independent agencies and hamper opportunities to add new agencies, resulting in limitations on the company's opportunities for growth, such as: Downgrades of the company's financial strength ratings Concerns that doing business with the company is too difficult Perceptions that the company's level of service, particularly claims service, is no longer a distinguishing characteristic in the marketplace Inability or unwillingness to nimbly develop and introduce coverage product updates and innovations that our competitors offer and consumers expect to find in the marketplace Actions of insurance departments, state attorneys general or other regulatory agencies, including a change to a federal system of regulation from a state-based system, that: Impose new obligations on us that increase our expenses or change the assumptions underlying our critical accounting estimates Place the insurance industry under greater regulatory scrutiny or result in new statutes, rules and regulations Restrict our ability to exit or reduce writings of unprofitable coverages or lines of business Add assessments for guaranty funds, other insurance‑related assessments or mandatory reinsurance arrangements; or that impair our ability to recover such assessments through future surcharges or other rate changes Increase our provision for federal income taxes due to changes in tax law Increase our other expenses Limit our ability to set fair, adequate and reasonable rates Place us at a disadvantage in the marketplace Restrict our ability to execute our business model, including the way we compensate agents Adverse outcomes from litigation or administrative proceedings Events or actions, including unauthorized intentional circumvention of controls, that reduce the company's future ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Unforeseen departure of certain executive officers or other key employees due to retirement, health or other causes that could interrupt progress toward important strategic goals or diminish the effectiveness of certain longstanding relationships with insurance agents and others Events, such as an epidemic, natural catastrophe or terrorism, that could hamper our ability to assemble our workforce at our headquarters location Further, the company's insurance businesses are subject to the effects of changing social, global, economic and regulatory environments. Public and regulatory initiatives have included efforts to adversely influence and restrict premium rates, restrict the ability to cancel policies, impose underwriting standards and expand overall regulation. The company also is subject to public and regulatory initiatives that can affect the market value for its common stock, such as measures affecting corporate financial reporting and governance. The ultimate changes and eventual effects, if any, of these initiatives are uncertain.

However, the Street closed the session after being off the day’s high points. Moneycontrol News Driven by a rally in global indices, which cheered the victory of Emmanuel Macron in the French Presidential elections, Indian markets began the week on a positive note. Moreover, a rally in banks, cements and realty aided the upmove. However, some selling pressure was also witnessed, which led to the market ending off the day’s high points. The 30-share Sensex closed up 67.35 points at 29926.15, while the Nifty ended 25.40 points higher at 9310.70. Market breadth, however, was narrow as 1,634 shares advanced against a decline of 1,155 shares declined, while 178 shares were unchanged. Total market turnover was seen at Rs 3.26 lakh crore. Ambuja Cements, Eicher Motors, Asian Paints and Lupin gained the most on both indices, while ITC, HDFC and BPCL lost the most. "Mergers in the cement space and positivity in construction and allied sectors kept markets buoyant. Earlier in the day, French electoral outcome’s positivity was dented weak Chinese data, but oil’s rise and Saudi and Russia’s readiness to extend production cuts could keep US equities northbound,” Anand James, Chief Market Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, said in a statement. On the indices front, the Nifty Bank outperformed during the day’s trade, with ICICI Bank leading the rally. The index closed nearly three-fourth of a percent higher. Meanwhile, midcaps witnessed a stellar performance as the Nifty midcap index ended over half a percent higher. Proctor and Gamble and Motherson Sumi gained during the day’s trade. Experts, however, are now turning cautious of this rally now. “The midcap index is trading at historically high valuations…PE multiples [of this kind] are something that we have never seen before,” Nilesh Shah, MD & CEO of Envision Capital told CNBC-TV18 in an interview.

and positions companies for the future News provided by YourEncore, Inc. 08 May, 2017, 07:45 ET Share this article INDIANAPOLIS, May 8, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Companies are facing a drastic talent drain. Over 10,000 Baby Boomers retire every day. A shortage of 40 million educationally qualified technicians and scientists is forecast by 2020, and 50% of Science and Engineering workers will be eligible for retirement over the same time horizon. The gap between the skills-experience-wisdom of retiring Baby Boomers and that of up-and-coming Millennials is a serious talent vacuum that many employers cite as their #1 challenge in achieving their business objectives. YourEncore®, the leading provider of proven expertise to the life sciences and consumer goods industries, helps companies close this talent gap through their Alumni Advantage™ solution set. This suite of services includes client-specific Alumni Talent Communities, Alumni Knowledge Capture, and Alumni Mentoring programs, all of which can be designed and deployed within 90 days. "YourEncore pioneered the concept of alumni management services nearly 15 years ago with Procter & Gamble, Eli Lilly, and Boeing," said Mike Lewis, Chief Sales & Marketing Officer at YourEncore. "Since then, we have significantly evolved our model, moving from simple management to comprehensive engagement that allows clients to tap into the wisdom and experience of their knowledge workers both before and after they exit the company. Our expanding list of Alumni Advantage clients, including General Mills, Battelle, and others, is a testament to our performance in this space and the growing need for this type of service." YourEncore® Alumni Talent Communities enroll and engage retirees and other former company employees who have decided to join the "gig economy" as a freelancer. This provides a pool of highly experienced, immediately effective talent that is ready, willing, and able to be deployed as needed. In addition, YourEncore Alumni Talent Communities have access to on-going training, collaboration tools, and social events, all designed and delivered to ensure that those within the Community stay engaged and effective. Clients can focus on business requirements and alumni relationships, confident that their program is being run in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations and that back-office functions are being handled efficiently. YourEncore® Alumni Knowledge Capture allows companies to document mission-critical wisdom and the tacit, experiential knowledge that resides in the minds of key company experts … before they walk out the door. YourEncore brings a disciplined approach and unique expertise to this process, which is critical for meaningful and successful execution. YourEncore® Alumni Mentoring brings retirees and current employees together for shared learning, knowledge transfer, and overall development of business acumen and professional gravitas. Many high-potential, early-career Millennials can benefit from mentoring by a Boomer who has "been there, done that." And Boomers report they learn a lot from and enjoy these mentoring relationships, as well. "It was almost ten years ago when we first connected with YourEncore and started to discuss this 'crazy idea' of leveraging external talent and retirees from diverse industries to help accelerate innovation," said Peter Erickson, Executive Vice President, Innovation, Technology, and Quality at General Mills. "I am very grateful to YourEncore for their leadership and tenacity in advancing a new approach across our organization. I have no doubt that we have brought better new products, product renovations, and cost savings to market than we could have done on our own." "Given the seismic shifts taking place in today's workforce, companies need to think differently about how they utilize talent, and individuals need to think differently about how they approach work," said Lewis. "YourEncore is uniquely positioned to provide both groups with the solutions they need to successfully navigate and take advantage of this perfect storm that is today's economy."

News sign-up Patanjali storms to second place in Indian FMCG market News, 08 May 2017 Topics Sales & distribution NEW DELHI: Patanjali Ayurved, India's home-grown FMCG brand, has announced earnings of Rs 10,561 crore for FY17, placing it second only to Hindustan Unilever in revenue and well ahead of its other international FMCG rivals. The company, founded in 2006, has soared to become one of the most powerful brands in India, outpacing multinational competitors which have been active in India for decades. (For more, including how the company is building an alternative brand to international competitors, read WARC's exclusive report: Patanjali Ayurved – the rise and rise of India’s homegrown FMCG giant.) According to the Economic Times, Patanjali's most recent revenue announcement of Rs 10,561 crore (over US$1.6bn) for the financial year to March 31 2017 eclipsed the combined revenue of multinational competitors Colgate-Palmolive, GSK Consumer Healthcare and P&G Hygiene and Healthcare, and catapults the company ahead of Nestle India for FMCG revenue in India. In an exclusive interview with WARC earlier this year, Patanjali's Head of Marketing, Avinash Kumar, was very confident the company would smash revenue targets: "We don't look at the past, we only look at the future. The only threat we fear is complacency, that is our only competition," he said. "We have the bandwidth to be successful across all categories. We have a team of champions. We get the job done." Patanjali's biggest concern, Kumar said, is that it might not be able to keep up with booming demand for its products, particularly in the oral care category. "We have different worries. Our worry is that our customers look for our products and we are not able to service them," he said. The company is now looking to hit Rs 20,000 crore in sales this fiscal year as it plans to double its distribution network to 12,000-strong. With an aggressive pricing strategy and a TV advertising focus, Patanjali has opened up new markets, previously untouched – and they are not worried about the competition. "We don't discuss multinationals or anybody for that matter, and there is a reason behind it," Kumar said in his interview with WARC. "We have decided hum apni line badi karenge, humme doosron ki line chhoti karne mein koi interest nahin. And sabse badi baat hai ki woh pareshan hain, hum pareshan nahin hain! [We have decided that we will strengthen our own line, we have no interest in reducing the line of others. The biggest thing is, they are worried, we aren't!]" Data sourced from Economic Times; additional content by WARC staff Sign up for daily news Latest News Marathon record unites sportswear rivals News Accenture acquires The Monkeys as CX battle heats up News AAPI women: buying power, influence grows News WARC launches 2017 Media Awards News Personalization to push $800bn revenue shift News India's 'scooterisation' gathers pace News Indians strongly prefer personalised ads News Patanjali storms to second place in Indian FMCG market View more News and Opinion More from WARC Patanjali Ayurved: The rise and rise of India's homegrown FMCG giant How India’s FMCG giants are approaching omni-channel and big data How FMCG brands are using online video Get a demo Topics Sales & distribution

The results were released one day before Berkshire’s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffett, 86, and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 93, were to answer five hours of questions from shareholders, journalists and analysts. That meeting is the centerpiece of a festive weekend of events throughout Omaha expected to draw more than 37,000 shareholders. Net income fell to $4.06 billion, or $2,469 per Class A share, from $5.59 billion, or $3,401, a year earlier, when Berkshire had a $1.9 billion gain from its swap of its Procter & Gamble Co stock for the Duracell battery business. Quarterly operating profit, which excludes investment and derivative gains and losses, fell 5 percent to a three-year low of $3.56 billion, or $2,163 per Class A share, from $3.74 billion, or $2,274. Analysts on average expected operating profit of about $2,666 per Class A share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Buffett believes Berkshire’s investment and derivative gains in any given quarter are often meaningless, but accounting rules require Berkshire to report them in its earnings statements. Despite the earnings shortfall, Buffett’s preferred measure of growth for Berkshire, book value per Class A share, or assets minus liabilities, rose 3.5 percent in the quarter to $178,073. The conglomerate also ended the quarter with roughly $96.5 billion of cash, equivalents and Treasury bills, a record sum and enough for one or more major acquisitions. Berkshire has more than 90 operating units in insurance, chemical, energy, food and clothing, railroad and other sectors, and also has large investments in stocks of companies such as Apple Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. Many Berkshire units are selling their wares at discounted prices at the annual meeting, while others offer memorabilia such as “Berky” boxers and bras, talking Warren Buffett dolls, and rubber ducks that look like Buffett and Munger for $5 a pair. Buffett has led Berkshire since 1965. AIG DEAL WEIGHS, BNSF GAINS Berkshire said its insurance businesses swung to a $267 million underwriting loss from a year-earlier profit of $213 million. This reflected higher losses from catastrophes in 2017, including an Australian cyclone in March; unexpectedly high losses related to hurricanes and earthquakes in 2016, and weaker results at the auto insurer Geico and the reinsurer General Re. It also reflected the amortization of deferred charges from Berkshire’s January agreement to take on many long-term risks in American International Group Inc’s property and casualty portfolio, in exchange for $10.2 billion upfront. That payment helped boost float, or the amount of insurance premiums collected before claims are paid and which helps fund Berkshire’s growth, to about $105 billion from $91 billion at the end of 2016. It also helped boost quarterly revenue 25 percent to $65.19 billion. Quarter-to-quarter swings “are about the mix of business and what is coming due, and what is being renewed,” said Cole Smead, portfolio manager at Smead Capital Management in Seattle. “This is not a disaster.” It is unclear whether Berkshire booked losses as Buffett began selling some of its stock in IBM Corp, which it has owned for about six years. Buffett told CNBC on Thursday he sold about one-third of Berkshire’s 81 million share stake in IBM this year, and no longer values the computer services company as highly as before. In other businesses, the BNSF railroad saw profit rise 7 percent to $838 million, helped by higher revenue from fuel surcharges and increased shipments of consumer products. Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a utility unit mostly owned by Berkshire, saw profit rise 14 percent to $501 million, helped by lower pension and maintenance costs at the PacifiCorp electric utility and a better rate structure for natural gas pipeline operator Kern River. In Friday trading, Berkshire Class A shares rose 0.2 percent to $250,000 and its Class B shares rose 0.1 percent to $166.55. The shares are roughly 6 percent below record highs set on March 2.

Laura Payton, Ottawa News Bureau Online Producer @laura_payton Published Monday, May 8, 2017 5:35PM EDT Last Updated Monday, May 8, 2017 6:17PM EDT OTTAWA -- Of all the Harper cabinet ministers who were said to ponder a run for the Conservative leadership, the biggest names didn't end up making a bid. Those that have are less well known. Perhaps the least well-known former cabinet minister is Erin O'Toole, despite impressing many politicos after jumping into the Veterans Affairs file to put out the inferno Julian Fantino left behind. O'Toole's quiet competence helped him cool the raging tempers Fantino incited with his mishandling, including getting caught on camera arguing with veterans with whom he'd cancelled a meeting, and walking away from the wife of an injured veteran who was trying to speak to him following a House committee meeting. The MP for Durham, a riding on the outskirts of the Greater Toronto Area, was first elected in a 2012 byelection to replace another faltering Harper minister, Bev Oda. He's held the riding, which includes his hometown of Bowmanville, ever since. With a father who served in the Ontario legislature, it may not have been a surprise for O'Toole to run for office. His career choices -- military service, Bay Street law -- until then certainly gave him the kind of well-rounded resume politicians can capitalize on. And yet you've likely never heard of him. "We always knew that name-recognition wise, that was really my one weakness. I've only been in politics four years," O'Toole, 44, said in an interview with CTV News, pointing out that time has been scandal-free. "You guys don't cover, 'hey this guy is turning around Veterans' Affairs'," he said. "My challenge was that. The only one with less political experience, Kevin O'Leary, certainly didn't need any name-recognition assistance." ERIN O'TOOLE AT A GLANCE Age: 44 Birthplace: Montreal, Quebec Relationship status: Married to Rebecca; has two children, Mollie and Jack Previous career: Lawyer, military officer Education: Royal Military College, Dalhousie law school Book on his nightstand: Tribe: On homecoming and belonging (by Sebastian Junger) To counter that, O'Toole says he's visited more places and talked to more party members than any other candidate. Much of that visiting has happened on the East Coast, where he says the party must rebuild in order to win in 2019 (it currently holds no seats in Atlantic Canada). It's also a region where O'Toole has lived, serving in Halifax and studying law at Dalhousie University. Prior to law school, he spent 10 years in the military. O'Toole enrolled at the Royal Military College in Kingston, Ont., at age 17 and became a helicopter air navigator in the Air Force. He remained in the reserves for another two years during law school, but left the Canadian Forces upon his return to Ontario. After law school, O'Toole and his wife Rebecca moved to Toronto, where he spent five years as a lawyer with Procter and Gamble Canada. "I like to say I bring the perspective of a kid from Bowmanville... but I understand military service and uniformed service," he said. "And then my economic experience I think is formative for this. So when I see the real impact of a regulation, or of a payroll tax, [it's because] I was part of management teams that looked at these issues." O'Toole's 74-page platform is a blend of both, promising tax cuts and balanced budgets as well as a bigger role for the military. It takes touchstones from the Harper era, like asserting Canadian sovereignty in the North and fighting to reform the UN, and adds property and gun-owner rights, as well as a pledge to let successful apprentices, college and university grads earn $100,000 tax-free in their first three years out of school. O'Toole is one of the leadership candidates emphasizing a focus on the positive, arguing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau doesn't own optimism. He -- like a number of other candidates - is also far more open to interviews than former prime minister Stephen Harper was. While he isn't distancing himself from Harper's policies, he has had to distance himself from a former Harper insider – his close friend, Jenni Byrne. Byrne ran the 2011 and 2015 Conservative election campaigns, and bore the brunt of the criticism over the party's recent loss, including some of the blame for an often nasty campaign. O'Toole's friendship with Byrne is something his competitors have quietly raised as a drawback to his potential leadership. O'Toole says Byrne isn't involved in his campaign, and isn't likely to return to the Hill should he win the leadership. "She's a friend," O'Toole said. "I’m known on the Hill for having respect, I think, on all sides of the House of Commons because I don't buy into treating people poorly. She left politics because it was the time for her to leave politics and she needed to get away from it. I think that was a smart move. " "I'm trying to run a campaign based on my approach, not how we've done things in the past, " he said. The Ontario MP says while he feels he shares Harper's ability to grasp complex issues and drive toward a solution, "the big difference between us is I want to communicate even with people that may be opposed to us." "I want people to know why I think some of these conservative ideas are good for the country... for whatever reason, the [former] prime minister didn't like to do a lot of media," O'Toole said. "I think we have to, to get back into the confidence of that group of Canadians that might have voted for us in [2011] but left us in [2015]."

Crow Holdings-Capital Real Estate will build the 1.2 million-square-foot warehouse campus near the southwest corner of Interstates 20 and 35E in Lancaster. Called I-35 Logistics Crossing, the project will have twin 610,806-square-foot warehouse buildings at the corner of Houston School and Wintergreen roads. Huge I-20 warehouse deal would fill a large new building Ben Doherty with Crow Holdings said the company is "very bullish on the D-FW market, especially Dallas' southern sector, because of strong industrial absorption levels in the region reinforced by continued population growth. "We were pleased with the results of our Mountain Creek project, also located in south Dallas, and welcome the opportunity to continue developing in the market," he said. Southern Dallas County is one of the fastest-growing industrial building markets in the country. Almost 4 million square feet of warehouse projects are under construction in the area along Interstates 20 and 45. Major companies including Quaker Foods, BMW, Procter & Gamble and Ace Hardware have located major distribution centers in southern Dallas County. In addition, logistics firms and transportation hubs make the area attractive for warehousing. Bottling firm leases major warehouse in I-20 corridor in SW Dallas "I-35 Logistics Crossing will provide users direct access to the D-FW region, Union Pacific Intermodal and FedEx Ground facility, as well as other major Texas markets such as Austin and San Antonio," said Cushman & Wakefield's Kurt Griffin, who is leasing the new Crow Holdings warehouse along with Nathan Orbin. "The city of Lancaster is a great place to do business and has a history of supporting industrial tenants through economic incentives, including property tax abatements." Crow Holdings' project is just the latest in a series of major warehouse developments to recently kick off along I-20. Houston-based developer Hines is starting a more than 1 million-square-foot warehouse project south of I-20 on Cleveland Road. With almost 16 million square feet of construction, Dallas is second nationally only to Chicago in total warehouse building, according to a first-quarter report from Cushman & Wakefield Inc.

The ice fields of Ellesmere Island are retreating due to warming temperatures. (Mario Tama/Getty Images) By Todd Stern By Todd Stern May 8 at 9:16 AM Todd Stern was U.S. special envoy for climate change from 2009 to 2016. President Trump is reportedly considering whether to pull the United States out of the Paris climate agreement. That would be a huge mistake, and you don’t have to be a softhearted environmentalist to understand why. Hardheaded analysis based on the interests of national security and U.S. business leads to the inescapable conclusion that remaining in the agreement is in America’s best interest. Start with national security, and listen to what the Pentagon said in its most recent (2014) Quadrennial Defense Review. After noting that climate change will increase sea levels, temperature and severe weather patterns, the review described “the pressures caused by climate change” as “threat multipliers that will aggravate stressors abroad such as poverty, environmental degradation, political instability, and social tensions — conditions that can enable terrorist activity and other forms of violence.” Could the Pentagon reason that climate change is important but the Paris agreement is not? No. Climate change is a global threat that can be countered only by global action, so an international regime is essential. After more than 20 years of trying, world leaders, with U.S. leadership, finally established that regime in Paris — strong, flexible, durable and fair. It would be an act of careless disregard for national security to walk away. As a matter of diplomacy, withdrawing from the Paris agreement would be a stain on the legacies of both the president and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, an act of diplomatic malpractice. Countries large and small, rich and poor, are deeply invested in Paris because they understand the peril of climate change and know the Paris agreement cannot be truly effective without U.S. engagement. They would see withdrawal as a slap in the face, disrespecting their fundamental interests and, in turn, eroding the United States’ diplomatic capital. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) This matters. In diplomacy, as in life, if you tell someone, “to hell with what you care about,” don’t expect open arms when you come calling with your own needs. Finally, if any one country stands to profit from the diplomatic capital the United Sates would waste from withdrawal, it’s China, which would depict itself as the hero willing to lead while the United States goes AWOL. It is unclear whether Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and national security adviser H.R. McMaster have been full-throated, aggressive participants in this debate, but they should be, considering the fateful stakes and their own equities. Now should be a look-in-the-mirror moment for them. They should go to the mat to prevent withdrawal. As for big business, the corporate community, from oil giants to tech firms to industrial behemoths, is strongly in favor of continued U.S. participation. Business support reads like a who’s who of major players, including DuPont, Hewlett-Packard, Apple, BP, General Mills, Google, PG&E, The Hartford, GE, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Microsoft, Johnson & Johnson, Cargill, General Motors, Bank of America, Intel, American Express, AT&T, Monsanto, Procter & Gamble, Nike, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Walmart and NRG Energy. The reasons for this support are clear. Business leaders are fact-based. There is no room for ideological nonsense in the “C-suite.” Whatever their political party, corporate executives get that climate change is real and most are actively planning business strategy to manage its consequences and limit their own emissions. They see Paris as a balanced agreement they can work with. Recognizing that negotiations on guidelines and rules will continue and that their interests on matters such as intellectual property, trade and transparency could be affected, business leaders care — a lot — about having U.S. negotiators at the table to protect those interests. They also value predictability and hate the political gamesmanship of pulling out of Paris. Finally, corporate leaders understand that the transition to clean energy presents one of the biggest economic opportunities of this century, that climate change is a major driver of this transition and that the United States is perfectly positioned to lead it with our unmatched culture of innovation. They also know, conversely, that opting out on climate change will undermine this chance to create jobs and wealth. So my advice to the president is: Listen carefully to the views of your national-security and diplomatic team as well as top business executives. Reach a decision soon, but don’t let anyone tell you that a final decision must be made before the G7 Summit later this month. There is no such deadline; the right decision is better than a hasty one. And keep in mind that — as much as I would be sorry to see any retrenchment — countries can adjust their emissions targets downward. The agreement permits it, and I know because I helped negotiate that flexibility. So don’t pull out — it’s a decision you’d live to regret.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 8 May 2017 by Rahul Jadhav Global Novelty Hair Color Market To Grow At A Remarkable Cagr Of 21.48% During The Period 2017-2021 Summary Orbis Research Presents Global Novelty Hair Color Market 2017-2021 has been prepared based on an in-depth market analysis with inputs from industry experts. Description The Following Companies As The Key Players In The Global Novelty Hair Color Market: L’oréal, Coty, Henkel, And Kao. Other Prominent Vendors in the market are: NEW AVON, Cadiveu Professional, Chatters, Combe, Conair, Estée Lauder, Godrej Consumer Products, Johnson & Johnson, Revlon, Shiseido Company, TONI&GUY, and World Hair Cosmetics (Asia). Commenting on the report, One trend in market is increasing demand for organic ingredients-based hair colors. The demand for plant-derived colors is emerging in the hair color market. Consumers are now moving forward to use the natural and herbal coloring agent for their hair. The usage of natural and herbal color is less harmful than the synthetic color as it is ammonia-free. This emerging demand has motivated the manufacturers to introduce plant-extracted color in their product portfolio. This particular product category of hair color is expected to drive the market growth in the near future.” According to the report, one driver in market is wide product portfolio and product innovation. Hair color products form a major segment of hair care products, which contributed almost 20% to the global hair care market’s revenue in 2016. Hair color products have a wide range of color and color shades. The most popular colors are blonde, brown, black, and red. Many other alternative colors such as green and blue are also available in the market. L’Oréal has the following colors for its L’Oréal Paris hair color products: blonde, bronde, brown, auburn, black, highlights and dip dye, hair lighteners, pastels, platinum, red, and violet. Different companies provide different color shades for their colors. L’Oréal’s popular color shades include Sunflower Blonde, Pure Diamond, Caramel, Hot-Toffee, Sparkling Amber, Havana Brown, Espresso, French Roast, Copper Shimmer, Ruby Fusion, Crushed Garnet, Blowout Burgundy, Chocolate Cherry, Midnight Ruby, and Leather Black. P&G’s Wella Professional has 116 color shades for its product Koleston Perfect. The introduction of hair chalks, a form of hair color that comes in different color shades, has helped consumers to change their hair color more frequently. It also allows them to match their hair color with their lipsticks, nail polish, and accessories. Get a PDF Sample of Global Novelty Hair Color Market Research Report @:http://www.orbisresearch.com/contacts/request-sample/277551 Further, the report states that one challenges in market is side effects of chemicals used in hair colors. Hair color products available in the market are either plant-derived or synthetic. One of the major components of synthetic dyes is PPD, which gives a bright and shiny color. But this component causes skin blistering, burning, and rashes on the human body. Another component of the hair color is ammonia, which is also harmful to humans. High concentration of ammonia can cause asthma. It can easily exacerbate the pre-existing breathing conditions. 4-Aminobiphenyl (4-ABP) is a hair dye by-product that has also been proven to have carcinogenic effects. To address this issue, manufacturers of hair colors are introducing ammonia-free hair color. L’Oréal introduced L’Oréal Paris Prodigy, an ammonia-free hair color. In 2014, Wella Professionals patented a new molecule named ME+, which is used as the replacement of PPD. Wella Professionals launched its permanent hair color Koleston Perfect Innosense, which is the first permanent color that has been approved by the European Centre for Allergy Research Foundation (ECARF). L’Oréal invested 3.4% of their annual expenditure in research and innovation and filed for 501 patents in 2014. The study was conducted using an objective combination of primary and secondary information including inputs from key participants in the industry. The report contains a comprehensive market and vendor landscape in addition to a SWOT analysis of the key vendors.

The bipartisan legislation would provide clear and equal protections under federal law for all Americans in vital areas of life, like employment, access to public spaces, housing, credit, education, jury service, and federally-funded programs. Today, in a majority of U.S. states (31), LGBTQ people remain at risk of being fired, evicted or denied services because of who they are. 'No person's fundamental rights should be determined by which side of a state line they live on,' said HRC President Chad Griffin. 'The Equality Act will once and for all end the unacceptable patchwork of non-discrimination laws across this country that leaves LGBTQ people at risk. Every American should have a fair chance to earn a living, provide for their families, and live their lives without fear of discrimination. And at its core, that's what the Equality Act is all about.' Discrimination is a real and persistent problem for far too many LGBTQ Americans. HRC polling has found that nearly two-thirds of self-identified LGBTQ Americans report experiencing discrimination - including people like Carter Brown, a transgender man from Texas who lost his job after he was outed by his colleagues. Currently, 50 percent of LGBTQ Americans like Mr. Brown live in states where they are at risk of being fired, denied housing, or refused service because of who they are. There is no federal law explicitly protecting LGBTQ people from discrimination, and 31 states still lack fully-inclusive non-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people. Today's announcement included unprecedented support from the business community: 92 major corporations have now joined HRC's Business Coalition for the Equality Act. While the overwhelming majority of America's leading businesses have already started addressing workplace fairness for LGBTQ employees, these major employers know how important the need is for a federal standard that treats all employees the same no matter which state they live in. The slate of companies endorsing the Equality Act have combined operations in all 50 states, headquarters spanning 23 states, and collectively generate $2.6 trillion in revenue. In total, these companies employ more than 5.8 million people across the United States. The overwhelming majority of Americans support full federal equality for LGBTQ people. Polling released last year by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) found that support for a bill like the Equality Act topped 70 percent nationally, including a majority of Democrats, Republicans and Independents. PRRI's groundbreaking survey included 42,000 interviews in 50 states and found majority support for the Equality Act in all 50 states. The Equality Act is co-sponsored by 240 members of Congress. It was first introduced in 2015 by Representative David Cicilline (D-RI) and by Senators Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Cory Booker (D-NJ). Major corporations in the HRC Business Coalition for the Equality Act include Abercrombie & Fitch Co.; Accenture; Adobe Systems Inc.; Advanced Micro Devices Inc.; Airbnb Inc.; Alcoa Inc.; Amazon.com Inc.; American Airlines; American Eagle Outfitters; American Express Global Business Travel; Apple Inc.; Arconic; Automatic Data Processing Inc.; Bank of America; Best Buy Co., Inc.; Biogen; Boehringer Ingelheim USA Corp.; Booz Allen Hamilton Inc.; Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc.; Brown-Forman Corp.; CA Technologies Inc.; Caesars Entertainment Corp.; Capital One Financial Corp.; Cardinal Health Inc.; Cargill Inc.; Chevron Corp.; Choice Hotels International Inc.; Cisco Systems Inc.; The Coca-Cola Co.; Corning Inc.; Cox Enterprises; CVS Health Corp.; Darden Restaurants Inc.; Delhaize America Inc.; Diageo North America; The Dow Chemical Co.; Dropbox Inc.; E.
