Like every corporation ever formed, P&G has to adapt or die, or maybe divide, to survive. More than five years into a turnaround, P&G executives have bet the company’s future on a plan to sell off a bunch of small brands to refocus the business on its 65 top-selling labels, including Pampers diapers and Tide detergent. For the last two years, executives urged investors to be patient while the company cut away more than 100 brands they didn’t want. But now that the company is smaller, it needs to get back to growing again – or risk the wrath of Wall Street. P&G is not alone among major companies that have struggled to grow amid a sluggish world economy since the Great Recession. And some, such as General Electric, Hewlett-Packard, Kraft, Dow and DuPont, have been forced to take even more drastic steps of larger asset sales or breakups. CEOs and boards of directors are obligated to scratch and fight. But options get more limited when growth stalls and competition intensifies amid stagnation. No one wants to become the next Kodak. Investors are waiting for the next several quarters to see if P&G’s changes deliver the promised results: A less sprawling, more focused company whose growth is powered by large brands that are “irresistibly superior” as pledged in April by a top executive. P&G executives say superior products are key to the next phase of their strategy. Cutting back brands was a tactical retreat. But new and improved products are part of their offense to win. By cutting other costs and simplifying the business, P&G can channel more attention and money to its leading brands that will see refreshed offerings that drive sustainable growth. “We’re as impatient as anyone to accelerate top-line growth and get back to our long-term target rates,” CEO David Taylor told Wall Street analysts in November. “But we want to get there and sustain it.” Waiting in the wings if things don’t go according to plan? A New York hedge fund with a track record of pressuring corporations to cut costs, sell assets and split apart has early this year taken a $3.2 billion stake in P&G. Of course, Procter & Gamble has been here before. Alphabet, Amazon top LinkedIn's top companies list Retail bankruptcies are exploding; here are the sectors where it’s happening Campbell Soup misses Wall Street forecasts, cuts sales outlook The current turnaround strategy is from the same playbook that P&G used to rebound spectacularly at the start of the millennium. In 2000, P&G’s sales growth was slowing and the company was reeling from an aborted acquisition to become a big player in the pharmaceutical industry. Then new CEO A.G. Lafley looked at the company’s brand portfolio and decided to slash slow-growing food brands, such as Crisco shortening and Jif peanut butter, and reinvest in its stronger personal care products. Under Lafley’s original tenure as CEO, the company expanded its beauty business, made its largest-ever acquisition (Gillette), and grew organic sales a robust 5% on average from 2000 to 2009. Lafley stepped up P&G’s current turnaround efforts after returning in 2013 following the retirement of CEO Bob McDonald. The big divestitures were Iams pet food, Duracell batteries and a raft of beauty brands, such as CoverGirl makeup, that management deemed slow-growing and a bad fit for the company’s core businesses. Still, P&G is a larger company than it was during its previous turnaround. Company executives have said progress won’t follow a straight line and there will be volatile quarters. Barclays analyst Lauren Lieberman wrote to investors on May 12 that P&G has made "significant progress" with its turnaround efforts, but results were "taking time to materialize." “We believe it will take considerable time for strategic and organizational changes being made to translate into a stabilization of market share and renewed sales growth,” Barclays analyst Lauren Lieberman wrote last month after P&G reported slowing sales in its latest quarter. Besides focusing on P&G’s biggest, most successful brands, the company is using another page from the Lafley playbook: Focus on growth in your biggest markets, too. P&G has also been working to fix its business in China, its second-largest market after the U.S. where it does more than $5 billion in business. In recent years, the company botched its product lineup there offering too many cheap products. While the Chinese economy has cooled, the company miscalculated the still strong demand for upscale products. To address that, P&G executives have high hopes for a new premium diaper being launched in China in August. Some observers bemoan a lack of dazzling innovations in recent years. But a brand new hit product, such as Swiffer or Crest Whitestrips, may not be enough to turn around a $65 billion behemoth like P&G. (Eighteen years after its introduction, Swiffer still hasn’t crossed the $1 billion sales mark. A new hit product won’t quickly generate $1 billion to $2 billion in additional company sales needed to return P&G to Wall Street’s good graces.) Still, P&G has reaped strong sales and market share from recent innovations. Tide Pods has popularized unit-dose washing, which is now a $2 billion business. Always Discreet, a more appealing product than adult diapers, has resonated with female consumers and has increased the category’s growth rate. Sales of Downey Unstoppables are strong. Pampers has grown sales by widening diaper sizes for larger and even the smallest babies. Speaking at the company’s “Analyst Day” event in November, CEO Taylor noted P&G transformed the auto air freshener market over six years after it rolled out Febreze Car, noting the category doubled to $500 million in the U.S., of which P&G now has a 45% share. “How many of you had a Christmas Tree hanging from your rearview mirror? A week later, they didn’t work,” Taylor said. “It illustrates what happens when you come with a product that solves a dilemma.” Selling some of its brands and thousands of job cuts have freed up cash for the company to reinvest. The company has eliminated 34,000 jobs in the last five years through a combination of brand sales and waves of buyouts that started in 2012. P&G has sold or shuttered 17 plants in five years and slashed more than $10 billion in costs over the last five years through jobs and other cuts. But P&G hasn’t reaped all the windfall it hoped from lower costs and a simplified business. The culprit: foreign exchange. Worldwide economic woes and sagging currencies from the Brazilian real to the Japanese yen have effectively wiped out $9 billion in total sales in the past two years. With nearly 60% of its sales outside the U.S., P&G is one of the 20 most vulnerable Fortune 500 companies to foreign exchange. P&G's Taylor has urged shareholder and Wall Street analysts to have faith in the steps the company has taken and urged them to be patient for the changes to sink in. But ordinary and institutional shareholders have been listening to those assurances now for five years from three different CEOs. Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj says P&G’s turnaround is lagging and the company should consider splitting apart. “We would like to see more financial progress… we expect to see over time that the company stops losing share, which accelerates the top-line,” Dibadj wrote to investors last month. “Nonetheless, this may deliver slower progress than a breakup. We continue to encourage the board and management to consider this option seriously.” Representatives of Nelson Peltz’s Trian Fund Management have not disclosed their plans for its $3.2 billion stake in P&G, nor has the firm published one of its famous “white papers” of unsolicited advice on how to maximize shareholder value. But the firm frequently targets down-on-their-luck companies and often suggests cuts and even breakups. In her note earlier this month, Lieberman sensed "a greater sense of urgency" at P&G. While she indicated Trian may work with P&G with suggestions for its turnaround without seeking a company split, but also added sluggish third quarter results don't help. "We do believe Trian thinks the company may not be moving fast enough," Lieberman wrote. Still, P&G’s 180-year-old story is far from over. There are other cards to be played. There are a lot of scenarios that could play out. But the company is now facing pressure like it has never seen. 25 CONNECTTWEET 26 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2qCNQ5g

The shift to digital marketing comes with a lack of reliable outcomes making it harder to forecast sales — bad news for pre-IPO startups and public companies By Tom Foremski for Tom Foremski: IMHO | May 19, 2017 -- 00:04 GMT (17:04 PDT) | Topic: Start-Ups Wall Street hates missed estimates. Photographer: Maciej Bledowski, Getty Images/iStockphoto The lesson for startups from Snap's recent share fall when it reported huge losses was not the lack of profitability -- it was that it missed analyst estimates despite a big jump in marketing spend. The seemingly unstoppable demise of the media industry has forced many companies to be media companies as they try to reach potential customers with their marketing through traditional and social media channels, and across multiple devices. In this fractured media world the old marketing programs don't work the same way while the new marketing programs might not work the same way the next time you try them. When I met Microsoft CMO Grad Conn earlier this year, he told me that everything he knew about marketing he had to re-learn and this is coming from a former Procter & Gamble marketing executive -- P&G marketing is almost a science. Google revamps ads to prioritize mobile, focus on local searches More than 50% of Google search queries now come from mobile devices, while location-related mobile searches are growing 50% faster than all mobile searches. Read More Traditional marketing such as advertising, TV, web seminars, trade shows, etc is less effective because potential customers are spending their time with many other types of media: social, games, Instagram, Twitter, forums, etc. It's a many-media world and company marketing campaigns are getting used to the fact that each type of media has to be approached in its own way which adds complexity. The fickle nature of online trends means that marketing needs to be vigilant and responsive on a near real-time basis. Microsoft employs more than 150 social media product managers for such tasks. ""You have to be constantly learning," says Conn. Constantly learning because things are constantly changing. Most CMOs would rather manage a process rather than be engaged in the process through leadership by example, Conn is an exception. This constant change in online trends means that the results of marketing programs cannot be used to a reliably forecast sales. With traditional marketing programs for example: P&G knows what each $1m spent in TV ads will generate in product sales. But what will $1m in marketing across a many-media landscape generate? Is it better to spend it on podcast sponsorships or maybe public relations? Foggy marketing... It's a fog as Sean Maloney, Intel's former CMO once told me when he spoke about the new types of challenges thrown up by this many-media landscape which because of Intel's global reach he had to figure out country by country. Intel currently has a marketing budget of over $2 billion showing the scale of this problem. When the marketing gets tough the tough get going: CMO job tenure continues to fall (3.5 years compared with CEOs 7.2 years). It's the toughest job in the C-suite. For IPO: Predictability trumps profitability... Predictability in revenues is the biggest challenge to tech IPOs -- not profitability as Snap found to its cost. All pre-IPO companies face the same scaling challenge: they have to demonstrate how invested capital equals predictable growth. Young tech companies know that revenues are lumpy and have tried to do away with estimates. When Google went public it said it would not issue any financial guidance -- but that didn't work. Pre-IPO statements such as Snap's warning about the difficulty in forecasting revenues didn't work either -- investors have their own risk assessment based on many factors. If companies don't offer guidance the consensus estimates could be way out of line and so would its effect on the share price. Missed estimates... Large companies face the same problems. A few recent headlines: IBM posts first revenue miss in five quarters, shares tumble Sramana Mitra Blog | SAP Continues to Soar, Despite Earnings Miss Johnson & Johnson misses estimates after $17B in revenue. Intel, Microsoft miss estimates, but growth businesses remain strong Cisco revenue forecast disappoints; says to cut 1,100 more jobs | Reuters Will AT&T Inc. (T) Stock Be Derailed By Its Earnings Fallout? | InvestorPlace Apple lower on revenues miss Twillio and other tech companies revise estimates Procter & Gamble sales disappoint... It is not fair to blame marketing unpredictability for making every company's financial estimates unreliable -- but it certainly does nothing to help improve accuracy. Online ads continue to fail in effectiveness and performance metrics are proliferating and confusing. In such an environment it is not surprising that marketing costs are rising says Gartner. As digital marketing spend overtakes traditional channels we should see: a rise in the number of missed financial estimates across all companies; stock volatility during earnings season will be more common; and the tech IPO pipeline will continue to struggle with successful launches. And there is no easy solution (tracking is not selling).

Old Navy increased like-for-like sales by 8% as millennials, those who became adults in the current century, lapped up the brand. Banana Republic and Gap outlets had a harder time with like-for-like sales dropping by 4% at both chains. Net sales for the first quarter were flat at US$3.4bn though they rose 2% on a like-for-like basis.

MENU Economy Business Politics and Policy Technology Reflections Arts, Culture & Society Anything But Books Entertainment & Variety Sports All News Authors Search Arts, Culture & Society Can you sell detachment and merchandise at the same stall? Karthik Venkatesh May 19, 2017, 17:32IST share this article The spiritual guru comes from a long line of non-materialistic sanyasis of yore, who espoused detachment and introspection. How do we reconcile the enlightenment role of the guru with the mediation function his modern-day avatars appear to be playing? The construction of Isha Foundation's 112-foot-tall statue of Adiyogi is under legal scrutiny over allegations that it does not comply with required environmental and building norms. The e-commerce site — sattvastore.com — is slickly designed and features a wider variety of merchandise ranging from CDs and books to puja accessories and apparel. Among the more interesting things featured in the website are an ‘anti-radiation’ chip which is apparently the result of ‘20 years of research and practical applications’ and claims to be a ‘radiation protector’ from mobile phones. Other interesting products are a board game based on the Mahabharatha, a ‘Vajrasan’ chair and a ‘smart’ pen that claims to teach children Sanskrit. The website, belonging to the Art of Living Foundation headed by Sri Sri Ravishankar, is an odd amalgam of Amazon and a more contemporary Ramanand Sagar. The e-commerce hub of the Isha Foundation headed by Jaggi Vasudev is similar to the Art of Living's, but it has the added advantage of the Sadhguru's mystique, complemented by the Adiyogi statue, shades, SUVs and faux Texan accent. The merchandise featured is eerily similar to the Art of Living site, albeit branded differently. It features a variety of foods, puja items and items of clothing and earrings that are ostensibly replicas of what the guru wears.   At a different point on this same spectrum is the Patanjali brand that belongs to Baba Ramdev, perhaps the most business-like of the lot. It is more on-the-ground than the others and has become wildly popular. Its run-ins with marketing laws notwithstanding, Patanjali has taken on the much-hyped might of Unilever and P&G, injured them seriously in one fell David-like swoop and captured the imagination of many. Besides these big players, other minor gurus too hawk their wares in websites and kirana stores. All of them have benefited from the fact that the ‘guru’ in question is closely associated with the products. It has lent these businesses a halo that, to an extent, overrides the ruthlessness that one has come to associate with business. It’s a puzzling phenomenon, this ‘business of gurudom’. In the traditional Hindu categorisation of an individual’s life-stages, the Sanyas ashrama was the last in a sequence of four. Preceded by the Brahmacharya, Grihastha and Vaanaprastha ashramas, the Sanyas ashrama was the final stop in the life of the Hindu upper-caste male. Sanyasis were supposed to cut themselves off from the world, focus entirely on spiritual matters and have no connection with worldly affairs. All of the gurus mentioned in this piece, and many who aren't, cultivate the sanyasi persona very consciously. By their own telling, they are detached from worldly affairs. And yet here they are peddling fancy clothing, toothpaste and the like. Is the detached persona, then, more an act than a true state of being? This is a seemingly irreconcilable contradiction worth thinking about. These items which are up for sale are by default are tied to messages of spirituality, detachment and healthy living that the gurus preach. But, what is the spiritual message that one could derive from a food item, a fancy pen or an item of clothing? How is one to reconcile toothpaste and spirituality or a ‘healthy’ food item and detachment? In their defence, perhaps these items are merely an adjunct. Perhaps they are a way of generating funds for the various social welfare projects these organisations also run, such as educational institutions, health-care facilities, environmental projects et al. But in my view, this phenomenon needs to be understood in its entirety.   The gurus of yore drew followers by shunning comfort and luxury. The gurus of today whisper the solace-giving message of ‘It’s alright’ into the troubled devotee’s ears and thereby mediate his guilt at worldly attachment. Firstly, the guru himself (sometimes herself) needs to be decoded. It would not be incorrect to say that what the gurus are offering is a spiritual Disneyland of sorts. This Disneyland performs a mediating function and, to an extent, also assists in a cultural reclamation project of sorts. Just as one enters Disneyland convinced (or at least hoping) that spending a few hours there will help reclaim one’s childhood (read happiness), people are entering these spiritual Disneylands in the hope of deriving ‘spiritual solace’ (read happiness) of a sort and thereby attempting reconciliation with the ruthless world they claim to be trapped in. This mediation is critical. Connecting with a ‘guru’ will help you reclaim a lost innocence and thereby maybe even absolve you in some convoluted way of accountability for your actions. It is almost as if the guru is indirectly telling you to continue eating whatever it is you are eating, and simply take a dose of spiritual antacid periodically to keep indigestion at bay. Guilt (over possessing material attachments) is more than a serious worry for many. To these fears, the guru is able to successfully convince many that he (or she) is the solution. By giving to the guru, one is "doing one’s duty" and thereby is allowed self-indulgence otherwise. The rule of compensation or expiation is at work here. One could perhaps understand this by understanding the gurus in the light of some of their own products. Take, for instance, the anti-radiation chip. It’s supposed to be an armour of sorts. It does not tell you to cut down on cell-phone usage to ‘protect’ yourself. It offers you the luxury of usage without damage. The guru is an armour too. He (or she) is the armour the devotee dons to protect himself from the world at large. The guru is also the medium, the shoulder, perhaps even the protector. The guru’s is the presence that eliminates the guilt. The ‘smart pen’ that teaches Sanskrit is an embodiment of the guru too. Harnessing hoary tradition and packaging it in digestible capsules is what the guru does in his preaching. The smart pen uses technology to ‘bring back’ the ancient which also happens to be sacred to many. The clothing and earring replicas allow you to own a ‘piece’ of the guru and hence perform the function of connection. Spiritual solace, protection, conservation and connection are what the devotee desires and what he gets. The mediator in all cases is the guru. ‘Inhabiting’ Guruland for a while every so often by attending a prayer meeting, a cultural mela or the like is an important ‘connecting’ mechanism. It is akin to a weekend getaway.   The collective draws you in and one loses all sense of the self. In that process, perhaps some experience a high of sorts. A high that one could even experience when one does the breathing exercises, chants the mantra or whatever it is that one has to do to ‘belong’ to the cult. Lastly, there is also the ‘cocking the snook’ angle. The gurus keep exalted company. Politicians and filmstars flock to their side and they seem to have an social stature that affords them and their organisations greater leeway within society. Events held by the organisations go on even if there are concerns over their compliance with environmental norms and impact on biodiversity. All of this counts for something in the follower’s eyes. He sees it as worthy of admiration, constitutional law be damned. The products themselves count for very little in the overall scheme of things. They are just a faint attempt at cashing in on the adulation that surrounds the guru though sometimes their success (as in the case of Patanjali to an extent) overtakes the guru. It is really the guru who is the overriding presence. Clearly, sanyas in present-day practice has less to do with detachment and more to do with mediation. The gurus of yore drew followers by shunning comfort and luxury. The gurus of today whisper the solace-giving message of ‘It’s alright’ into the troubled devotee’s ears and thereby mediate his guilt at worldly attachment and render him battle-ready for the big, bad world. And for this, a fat middleman’s fee (aka donations, contribution etc.) changes hands. Everyone is making money and having a good time, so why can’t they? Is that a good bottom-line?

CONTRIBUTED PHOTO Filipina campaigners bowed to superior opposition on Thursday, failing to advance beyond the women’s team and individual all-around qualifying round at the start of the 7th Asian Seniors Artistic Gymnastics Championships at the Nimibutr Gymnasium in Bangkok, Thailand. The Nationals were left reeling in the onslaught of powerhouses China, North Korea and Japan, which dominated the day’s events, underscoring their gap with the best in the continent and the work that needs to be done before the Malaysia Southeast Asian Games in August. For a while, their hopes were up when Filipina-American Kaitln de Guzman surprisingly topped the floor exercise with a score of 12.20 points after the first subdivision or bracket in the trip supported by the Philippine Sports Commission. In the end however, De Guzman, the daughter of former SEA Games gold medalist Cintamoni de Guzman, plunged deeper in the rankings and eventually fell by the wayside as the Chinese, North Koreans and Japanese took to the floor. Liu Tingting captured the individual all-around gold medal, anchoring the mighty Chinese to the team gold and a sweep of the tournament’s first two mints up for grabs. Only the top eight finishers, with a maximum of two gymnasts per country, in the all-around event will advance to the individual apparatus finals scheduled for Saturday and Sunday. Apparently rattled in her first outing for the Philippines, De Guzman was uncharacteristically sloppy in her pet event, the uneven bars, garnering 11.45 points, far below the 14.20 points she scored in the Procter and Gamble National Championships in St. Louis, Missouri held in June last year. Her P&G tournament score was even better than Chinese individual all-around champion Liu’s top-scoring 13.45 points in the uneven bars here. The Fil-Am’s tally then was good for No. 11 overall among the 33 entries throughout the US in the competition meant for elite American gymnasts eyeing a spot on Team USA. Although holding dual citizenship, De Guzman has decided to compete for her mother’s home country in international competitions. The elder De Guzman won a gold medal on the same apparatus in the 1995 Southeast Asian Games held in Chiang Mai, Thailand. “I would rather forget that score. It wasn’t me,” the younger De Guzman said, shrugging her shoulders when interviewed. Still, the national team rookie had the best score among the PH bets with a total tally of 45.60 points, counting her output in the vault and balance beam events, followed by Singapore SEA Games veteran Cristina Onofre (44.45) and Erin Evangelista (41.20). National coach Jasmin Ortega admitted that her wards still had much to work on in their bid to improve on their bronze-medal finish in the team in the Singapore SEA Games two years ago. “This is basically a new squad and we really wanted to measure ourselves against our Southeast Asian rivals,” Ortega said. “We need to make some adjustments but we still have enough time before Malaysia.” The Malaysians sent a warning signal to their regional rivals that they would be a force to reckon with on their home ground, finishing fourth overall in the team event with 142.750 points. Singapore SEAG double gold medalist Farah Ann Abdul Hadi ranked No. 12 overall while teammate Tan Ing Yueh, who took the uneven bars gold in 2015, ranked even higher at No. 12. Share.

The revenue contribution of disposable diapers in the region will increase approximately 44% by 2022     Baby Diaper Market - Industry Analysis, Market Share , Size and Growth Forecast   Spread the Word Listed Under Tags: • Baby Diapers Market • Baby Diapers • Diapers Market Industry: • Business Location: • Bangalore - Karnataka - India Subject: • ReportsBANGALORE, India - May 19, 2017 - PRLog -- Beige Market Intelligence has announced the publication of its latest market research report titled the Global Baby Diapers Market – Strategic Assessment and Forecast 2017–2022. The report provides a detailed study of the worldwide baby diapers market and forecasts the market size in various regions such as APAC, Europe, Latin America, MEA, and North America.  It provides the detailed market size by products in each region. Baby Diapers Market in APAC APAC is one of the fastest growing diaper markets. In terms of consumption, APAC is the leading market with annual consumption of 97.40 billion units in 2016. Key countries in APAC such as  India, China, Korea, and Indonesia are witnessing increase in population, rise in purchasing power, improvement in healthcare standards, which is leading to the decline in the infant mortality rate. Also, the demographic shift from rural to urban area is pushing the demand for nappies in these countries. The growing population in these regions offers manufacturers an opportunity to expand their market base. Local companies along with established global brands will witness a high competition in these regions to capture the newly developing diapers market. Key vendors such as P&G, Kimberly-Clark have set up their manufacturing units in APAC countries due to huge potential in the region.

Single-use Disposable Baby Diapers Market in APAC The APAC diapers market is dominated by single-use disposable nappies and is expected to dominate the market during the forecasted period. There is hardly any awareness or demand for other types of diapers such as swim, training, or bio-degradable. These nappies are 4–5X expensive than single-use disposable nappies, hence cost-conscious consumers in APAC do not prefer expensive nappies as a viable option. The single-use disposable baby diapers market in APAC, which contributed approximately 43% revenue in 2016, will dominate the market in the coming years and its contribution will increase further to approximately 44% by 2022, say analysts at Beige Market Intelligence. In the developing countries in APAC such as India, China, Vietnam, and Indonesia, the demand for disposable nappies is increasing at a rapid rate with increasing birth rates and growing awareness about baby hygiene. Additionally, the disposable income in these regions is increasing, and efforts of manufacturers to introduce low cost baby nappies in the region have led to increase in the popularity of disposable diapers.

Ibraheem Abbas pushes the boundaries of Arab culture in the 21st century. (Photos by Amina Al-Jeffery) Abbas’ first novel, “HWJN”, is about a 90-year-old jinn. 3 photos Novelist Ibraheem Abbas is a pioneer in a genre that is more than a century old. Taking the best elements of science fiction popularized in the West by such greats as Ray Bradbury’s “The Martian Chronicles” to anything by Arthur C. Clarke, Abbas has added a Saudi twist with his own stories by conflating Arab mythology and SciFi. Abbas is a rare breed in Saudi Arabia. In addition to mixing sci-fi, fantasy and adolescent adventure, he is also a creative director and filmmaker. He co-founded Yatakhayalon (The League of Arabic SciFiers), a publishing house, and hopes to enrich the Kingdom by encouraging an Arabic sci-fi culture. Sitting with Abbas, one feels he is a unique sort of blend between a moderate and ideologue, both in his writing and as a person. The common denominator in each of his pieces is his singular ability to blend Arab history with a futuristic punch. He graduated with a bachelor’s degree in computer engineering, being the closest to his aspired field of graphic and 3-D design. He also worked in marketing at Procter & Gamble. Springing from one field to another, seeking a position where his talent could be exercised and prosper, Abbas was eventually rescued by the burgeoning Saudi advertising industry during the time in which he found the title “creative director.” Certainly working as a creative director provided an outlet for Abbas’ fertile imagination, but it was writing fantasy and SciFi that fulfilled him. His first novel, “HWJN,” is the story of forbidden love between a 90-year-old supernatural jinn, who experiences his first interactions with the human dimension through a relationship with a young woman. The novel is told from the perspective of the supernatural creatures and cleverly conveys their standpoint on humans. (In Islam, jinn are extraterrestrial, invisible creatures believed to have been made from “smokeless fire by God.”) In writing “HWJN,” Abbas had no intention of publishing the story. It was merely a medium where he could channel his “personal creative journey” in which he allowed his notions to roam free. But when he ultimately decided to publish “HWJN,” Abbas and his partner, Yasser Bahjatt, hit a brick wall. Publishers didn’t want it. It was too fantastical for Arab tastes. As a result, they were compelled to launch Yatakhayloon where it was successfully published. Thereafter, “HWJN”, according to Wired Magazine, fueled “rumors, particularly from parents, that it was promoting sorcery and devil-worship” among the youth. As the book received more attention, religious authorities were reluctant to see “HWJN” on Saudi bookshelves for the same reason. Nevertheless, the book hit the top of Saudi Arabia’s best-seller list in 2013. Readers were quick to latch onto Abbas’ stories hoping it would establish a dialogue between Western and Arabic sci-fi. After gaining positive recognition internationally, the January 2014 New York Review of Science Fiction said, “It’s a great YA (young adults) novel... one which would go down very well with a Western YA readership.” Not all Western sci-fi readers shared the same enthusiasm and some skeptical Saudis had difficulty accepting other aspects of the story. It was thought to have presented a view of women that would be deemed patronizing to Western readers. Arab-English book reviewer Ian Campbell said: “The ending is deeply problematic from a liberal Western viewpoint.” Having said that, Abbas acknowledges the fact that this very detail “sneaks into another kind of patronizing expectation that a book can only be good if it reflects our prejudices. This is a book that we SciFi readers in the West can learn from.” Subsequent to success the of “HWJN,” Abbas was encouraged to write Hunak. In lieu of writing sequels, as is often a convention in a second-book release, Abbas seamlessly ties the knot with his third book, “Binyameen.” His latest piece, “The Hypnotized Ones,” is a narrative of three Arabic historical figures, each possessing their own pronounced characteristics that are the direct antithesis of the others. He carefully refrains from burdening his writing with philosophical meanings. His distinctive style is the product of employing limited resources to spark inquisition in the minds of his audience. He says his objective is to deliver “entertainment,” plain and simple. “Sometimes, yes, some of my readers discover strong messages I had not even intended on,” Abbas said. Abbas tells Arab News that creating a “fun” experience for people is what prompts him to write. Furthermore, he wants to encourage open-mindedness in his readers’ minds and challenge engineered societal conformities. Abbas possesses a fiery passion for sci-fi. He thrives a little on pushing boundaries. Promoting a genre that is more or less ignored in this region, he pares away everything pertaining to the mere shadow of orthodoxy. He advises young talents to pivot their predominant and transient aspirations of reaching fame to finding fulfillment in doing what they love to do. He believes that young Saudis answer to, and perform better, in competitive networks. He suggests that more platforms, where they can showcase their work, would generate more Saudi talent and produce higher quality work. Abbas notes that as young Saudi talent rises, impediments they face grow proportionally. They become subject to the abrasive censuring of a society whose principal concern is the way in which the next person perceives them. Measured by the unregulated and variable interpretations of the “norms,” individuals construct a meager and feigned attempt at creative art, he believes. “A false and enforced perfection,” Abbas observes. The very act of molding art to please conflicting ideologies in society will undoubtedly render the product watered down. Often Abbas feels that myriad Saudi dreams have died at confronting the question, “What will other people think of me?” He believes that being raised by parents who anchored tolerance in their home contributed to his experimental nature. In a large family, however, where undivided attention is scarce, Abbas said he learned “to create my own atmosphere, and invent my own toys, my own fun.” Abbas is realizing his plans of converting “HWJN” into a movie. He has faith it will be a quantum leap in the sci-fi genre and will excite a succession of productions in the region. — Email: [email protected] Novelist Ibraheem Abbas is a pioneer in a genre that is more than a century old.

He thrives a little on pushing boundaries. Promoting a genre that is more or less ignored in this region, he pares away everything pertaining to the mere shadow of orthodoxy. He advises young talents to pivot their predominant and transient aspirations of reaching fame to finding fulfillment in doing what they love to do. He believes that young Saudis answer to, and perform better, in competitive networks. He suggests that more platforms, where they can showcase their work, would generate more Saudi talent and produce higher quality work. Abbas notes that as young Saudi talent rises, impediments they face grow proportionally. They become subject to the abrasive censuring of a society whose principal concern is the way in which the next person perceives them. Measured by the unregulated and variable interpretations of the “norms,” individuals construct a meager and feigned attempt at creative art, he believes. “A false and enforced perfection,” Abbas observes. The very act of molding art to please conflicting ideologies in society will undoubtedly render the product watered down. Often Abbas feels that myriad Saudi dreams have died at confronting the question, “What will other people think of me?” He believes that being raised by parents who anchored tolerance in their home contributed to his experimental nature. In a large family, however, where undivided attention is scarce, Abbas said he learned “to create my own atmosphere, and invent my own toys, my own fun.” Abbas is realizing his plans of converting “HWJN” into a movie. He has faith it will be a quantum leap in the sci-fi genre and will excite a succession of productions in the region. — Email: [email protected] Comments View the discussion thread.

Kuala Lumpur Kepong Berhad, Oleon & Wilmar International News provided by Research and Markets 19 May, 2017, 15:15 ET Share this article DUBLIN, May 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Global Glycerol Market 2017-2021" report to their offering. The global glycerol market to grow at a CAGR of 8.73% during the period 2017-2021. The report, Global Glycerol Market 2017-2021, has been prepared based on an in-depth market analysis with inputs from industry experts. The report covers the market landscape and its growth prospects over the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market. One trend in market is growth of personal care industry. Glycerol is extensively used as a thickening agent, emulsifier, lubricant, and humectant in cosmetic and personal care applications. Consumers in developed as well as developing countries such as the US, the UK, Australia, Canada, France, China, India, Saudi Arabia, and Germany spend heavily on cosmetics. So, the consumption of cosmetic products is high in these countries, which is attributed to the high disposable income. According to the report, one driver in market is growing production of biodiesel. Globally, there is a growing interest in alternate fuels on account of the uncertainty in global fuel prices, energy security, and the continuous rise in emission levels. There is a demand for fuels that reduce the carbon emission levels and have commercial possibilities. The gradual depletion of fossil fuel reserves has given rise to renewable biofuels. The R&D efforts worldwide have led to the use of biofuels, which are gradually moving to large-scale commercialization because their performance is similar to gasoline and diesel. Biofuel blends are now being used in regular vehicles with little or no modification to the engines, which is encouraging the use of blended fuels in vehicles. Biofuels produce lesser greenhouse gas emissions in comparison to conventional fuels depending on the blend. Biofuels also reduce the amount of sulfur and hydrocarbon emissions in the air.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman $1+ Billion Bioprinting Market: Global Materials, Equipment and Applications Report 2017-2027 /EIN News/ — Dublin, May 19, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Research and Markets has announced the addition of the „Bioprinting Markets: Materials, Equipment and Applications – 2017 to 2027” report to their offering. The analysis suggests that by 2027, bioprinting applications will generate over $1 billion in revenue, accompanied by a healthy market in specialist bioprinting hardware and materials. The report believes that the potential for the bioprinting sector has increased considerably in the past couple of years. What we are seeing is that (1) bioprinters themselves have technologically matured and (2) they have also become more accessible in terms of cost to a wider target of users — low-cost desktop bioprinters are available at below $20,000. Meanwhile, bioprinting is experiencing a rapid transformation from basic research in academic laboratories to an emerging industry due to its near-term potential in areas such as drug discovery, personalized medicine, regenerative medicine, cosmetics testing, medical devices and food manufacturing. While printing complete organs still seems a long way off, revenues from bioprinting are already being generated from these more immediate applications. This report explores the commercial implications of bioprinting in depth and includes: – Ten-year forecasts of bioprinting materials, hardware and applications markets. Materials are broken out by type and forecasted hardware is presented by both unit sales and in revenue terms, with breakouts by process technology and price point. Revenues for bioprinting applications are segmented by the type of application – specifically, drug discovery, cosmetics testing, medical devices and tissue regeneration. – Highly granular information about current pricing of both bioprinters and printing materials for bioprinting applications. In addition, the report provides detailed information on which companies and institutions are using bioprinters today and which printers they are using. – An assessment of the product/market strategies of emerging and established firms in the bioprinting space. While many of the firms pioneering this space are well-funded and innovative start-ups, bioprinting is also attracting the attention of some of the largest multinationals in big pharma and cosmetics, for example. Astellas Pharma, Bristol-Meyers Squibb, Merck, Novartis, Procter and Gamble, Roche and others all have bioprinting programs, as do some of the large research facilities in the world, such as the National Institutes of Health in the US. Meanwhile, bioprinting continues to be a favorite target of venture capital firms. – A full discussion of the latest developments in droplet and extrusion bio printer and what they mean both technically and from a business perspective. Also included is an analysis of the very diverse market for bioprinted materials. Emerging bioinks, include combinations of polymers, ceramics, cells, cell aggregates, peptides, growth factors, hydrogels, scaffold components, and other materials.

Rodney Frelinghuysen, left. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Rep. Rodney Frelinhuysen’s (R-11) controversial yes vote on the American Health Care Act and a fundraising letter he sent targeting one of his constituents have shifted the dynamics of his district ahead of the 2018 midterms, according to an analysis by the Cook Political Report released Friday. Cook moved the 11th District one notch to the left, a notable change due to the district’s history as a Republican stronghold in past elections. In 2000, Frelinghuysen’s seat was considered so safe for Republicans that Frelinghuysen’s most high-profile competitor was a ficus tree registered as a gag by filmmaker Michael Moore. Frelinghuysen’s district went from “likely Republican” to “lean Republican” for the 2018 race, Cook said. Cook took notice of a recent episode in which Frelinghuysen targeted one of his constituents. In March, Frelinghuysen sent a letter to a Lakewood Bank director targeting one of their employees, Saily Avelenda, who was criticizing him in the press as part of the activist group NJ 11th for Change. Frelinghuysen called Avelenda a “ringleader” of the group in a fundraising appeal to Joseph O’Dowd, a Lakewood Bank director who has donated $2,300 to the congressman over the years. Avelenda was questioned about her remarks in the press and ended up resigning. Cook also mentioned shifting demographics in the 11th District, which became a slightly schizophrenic mixture of the deep-red Morris County suburbs and ultra-liberal Montclair after redistricting in 2011. But political experts said the district, which has the largest number of Republicans in New Jersey, 160,000, is gerrymandered in a way to protect the Republican incumbent. A wave election in which voters across the country swing to the Democrats would be the only real shot to flip the district, some say. “The well-educated district is trending rapidly away from the GOP, Frelinghuysen voted in favor of the AHCA, and he’s drawn a female challenger with an impressive resume, former Navy pilot and federal prosecutor Mikie Sherrill,” the Cook report said. In addition to Sherrill, Assemblyman John McKeon (D-Essex) is also eyeing a run. One challenge for Frelinghuysen, according to Cook, is that his competitor likely will be well-funded for the first time since 1992. As chairman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee and as a scion of the Procter and Gamble fortune, Frelinghuysen, a member of one of New Jersey’s oldest political dynasties, should have little trouble building up his own campaign account. “Between his vote for the Republican repeal bill, which would gut protections for pre-existing conditions, increase premiums and kick millions off their healthcare, and his unethical harassment of his own constituent, Frelinghuysen is ripe for replacement,” Evan Lukaske, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said in a statement. But, according to Nation Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Chris Martin, the report does not indicate an imminent shift in the 2018 election. “If arbitrary beltway prognostication translated into electoral results, Hillary Clinton would be president today,” Martin said. “Congressman Frelinghuysen has a long, proven record of getting results for the 11th district.” The AHCA vote also shifted the dynamics in other New Jersey districts that have been reliably Republican in past elections, according to the Cook Political Report. Following a successful vote in the House earlier this month, Cook shifted Rep. Leonard Lance (R-7) and Rep. Tom MacArthur’s (R-3) districts slightly leftward.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Grey Announces UNICEF Partnership And The Formation Of The UNICEF + Grey Global Kids Council NEW YORK, May 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Building on a long tradition of pro bono work to better the world, for its 100th year anniversary, Grey has partnered with UNICEF to help improve the lives of children around the world. Together they will create the UNICEF + Grey Global Kids Council for mentorship and marketing initiatives and, more immediately, a back-to-school pro bono campaign, launching in the fall. The UNICEF + Grey Global Kids Council is a nod to Grey’s longstanding Global Creative Council that comes together each year to discuss work. The kids version will comprise young people from six countries across six continents – the USA, The Netherlands, South Africa, Brazil, India and Turkey – paired with Grey global offices as they are trained in the fundamentals of marketing, offering them knowledge and resources to create meaningful change and rally around children’s causes in their countries, in preparation for World Children’s Day on November 20, 2017. „Grey has always been an agency that values diversity of experiences and ideas using our colorful minds for the greater good, and we are honored to formalize a partnership with UNICEF to continue that tradition,” said Grey’s Global President, Michael Houston. „Diversity is borderless, and knows no bounds, and it’s this philosophy that we hope to instill in these children – empowering them to make an impact on the world as their unique perceptions and perspectives will help to achieve both local and global insights to problems facing youth today, and ideas for how to solve them.” To highlight and support UNICEF’s work to ensure that every child has access to education, Grey will create a back-to-school pro bono campaign launching in late summer. The campaign will aim to educate and fundraise for UNICEF’s programs to put children first. This integrated marketing movement will combine the organization’s channels and resources with Grey’s creative expertise around a key moment for many families. „This partnership speaks to some of the core ideas that UNICEF USA has worked to support for more than 70 years – kids helping their peers around the world and empowering the next generation of global citizens – along with shared ideals around creative problem solving and using global reach to support local communities,” said Caryl Stern, President and CEO, UNICEF USA. „This new partnership model allows kids the valuable opportunity to improve their lives and shape their futures – we can’t wait to see the results.” About Grey     Grey is the advertising network of Grey Group, which is led by James R. Heekin III, Chairman and CEO. Grey Group ranks among the largest global communications companies. Its parent company is WPP (NASDAQ : WPPGY).  Under the banner of „Grey Famously Effective Since 1917,” the agency serves a blue-chip roster of many of the world’s best known companies: Procter & Gamble, GlaxoSmithKline, Kellogg’s, Pfizer, Canon, NFL, Boehringer Ingelheim, Marriott Hotels & Resorts, Nestlé, Papa John’s and T.J. Maxx. Grey was named ADWEEK’s „Global Agency of the Year” for 2015. (www.grey.com) About UNICEF UNICEF promotes the rights and wellbeing of every child, in everything we do. Together with our partners, we work in 190 countries and territories to translate that commitment into practical action, focusing special effort on reaching the most vulnerable and excluded children, to the benefit of all children, everywhere.
