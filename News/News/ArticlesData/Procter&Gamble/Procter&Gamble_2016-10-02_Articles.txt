It’s a huge mistake’ Leon co-founder John Vincent started out at Procter & Gamble, before moving to global consulting firm, Bain and Company Credit: Jon Cartwright/Leon Anna Isaac 3 October 2016 • 6:00pm John Vincent, Leon's co-founder and chief executive, talks to Anna Isaac about his business background, what motivates him, and the pros and cons of leaving the EU. What’s your business background? I’m a child of the 1980s from north London. Growing up there, it was all about commerce; I had lots of Asian, Greek and Turkish friends. Many of my school friends’ parents had set up small businesses. It was a very entrepreneurial environment. You also had people such as Richard Branson, who one looked at and thought: “They have fun lives.” At university I set up an entertainment production company – power distribution, bands, DJs and so on. This was the early years of dance music in 1989. It was a great way to marry business and fun. Then I started out at Procter & Gamble (P&G). My job was to take a box of products around different chemists, restock their supplies and reorder. It was character building, but it wasn’t interesting. And there was one thing I hated about working at P&G: the advertising process. Step one involved creating the fear factor, which was a bit like saying: “Isn’t it awful when your friend comes around and your kitchen is dirty?” I didn’t want to create fear or encourage shame. I left to join [global consulting firm] Bain and Company, where I worked for seven years. I worked on taking businesses apart, and then putting them back together. You learned to understand strategy, finance and operations. I was in the machine at P&G, but at Bain, I was on the outside, working as a consultant to the board or chief executive for companies in a range of industries. How did Leon get started? I decided that I had spent too much time dreaming about it. It was time to go and do my own thing. So I sat down with a colleague of mine at the time, Henry Dimbleby, and we decided to write down five business ideas each. Good fast food was common on both lists. Henry had a vision of doing it in bowls. I had a vision of doing it more like McDonald’s. Eventually we decided to go down the McDonald’s route. The idea was simple: “If God did fast food.” That dictated everything: where we would be on the high street; the format of the kitchen; the freshness and flavour of the ingredients; and the fact that employees smile because they want to. We started out on Carnaby Street, London, right in the thick of the competition. We were next to a Starbucks and a Pret. We were lucky, because we hit upon something people really wanted – good fast food. What’s your inspiration? There’s a great book called Mastery by George Leonard, and another called The Great Work of Your Life, by Stephen Cope. What they both say between them is that happiness and fulfillment comes from becoming really good at something, honing it, mastering it, and then giving up the fruits. Lots of people come into business for money. It’s a huge mistake. If that’s your focus, then you will fall off balance. If you’re able to master something and encourage your team to master it too, you’re on the right path. You need positivity and purpose.   There are people on superyachts, such as Sir Philip Green. Do you think he’s happy, when he’s being hounded by the press because of pensions? Some people pursue money at all costs and it catches up with them in a very biblical, Shakespearian way.   The stereotypes of what makes a businessperson: CCTV at a big house in Surrey, and driving a Maserati. That’s not true happiness. We need to break down this concept of the union and workers over here – and the fat cats over there. We all should want to delight in communities and achievement. What are your views on Brexit? It could bring a lot of opportunities. It’s already bringing a much greater sense of accountability and self-responsibility in the UK. But I have concerns about being able to hire and retain staff. The impact [of the referendum result] on the team was that they were very upset. They felt – in many cases – that it was a signal that they [as immigrants] were not welcome. They were worried about being able to stay. A huge part of what my staff enjoy is the fact that there’s a real cultural richness among employees at Leon. I don’t want to compromise that. It’s a very Mediterranean brand. I want to be able to employ people who can project and understand that – people from Italy, the south of France and so on. We still don’t know – and the government won’t tell us – what the immigration situation is going to be. Since Brexit our ability to recruit has been weakened. We’re now struggling to hire enough people when we open a new store. Why have you sought to diversify, with cookbooks, cookware and so on, alongside fast food? It’s about brand definition. Our mission is to make it easier for everyone to eat and live well. Things such as sharing recipes, helping out with school food, offering cookware and so on, is all part of that. But focus, for businesses, is always paramount. Growth comes from focus and repeatability, and to do that you need a clear mission. Someone else setting up a restaurant perhaps shouldn’t do the same thing as we have at Leon; it’s about what’s right for them. It’s about their passion. They might say they’re a restauranter and a tech master, in which case they should follow that route. Go with your capabilities and your mission.

PHOTO | FILE  In Summary The Procter & Gamble product, having spoofed itself for years with advice on how to become more “mantastic,” posts to its 2.6 million Facebook followers a steady stream of video games, prize entries, and advertisements as short as two seconds. Advertisement New York. Almost 80 years old, the deodorant Old Spice is learning new tricks for finding customers in the era of smartphones and social media. The Procter & Gamble product, having spoofed itself for years with advice on how to become more “mantastic,” posts to its 2.6 million Facebook followers a steady stream of video games, prize entries, and advertisements as short as two seconds. Creating “thumb-stopping” content is the goal, and marketers are doing everything they can to achieve it. That includes using neuroscience to study which visual and audio cues offer the best bet to grabbing and keeping an impatient smartphone user’s attention. Estimates show that the average person looks at his or her smartphone as much as 150 times a day. The attention is there, but it’s just not long-lived. “You get the three-second audition,” said Frank Amorese, media director at Heineken USA. “If you are relying on the 14th or 15th second to do the heavy lifting of the ad, it’s not going to work.” Advertisers are in a dizzying race to connect with customers as new mobile-borne social media platforms emerge and evolve. “The landscape changes every six months,” Amorese said. “It’s changing at an increasingly fast rate.” Digital ad spending is projected to reach $72.1 billion in 2016, growing at a rate of 21 per cent and now comprising almost 37 per cent of the overall market, according to eMarketer. Social media accounts for $15.4 billion of this. Heineken has doubled its spending on digital ads to 30 per cent over the last five years. The dominance of smaller mobile devices has heightened the challenge of capturing the attention of potential shoppers. Ads must be tailored depending on whether they are being seen on a widescreen television, a tablet or a smartphone and must not demand too much time if a consumer is merely glancing at a feed and not planning on a lengthy stay. “We have to really identify how do consumers engage with every single platform and then what is the creative experience we need to give them,” said P&G chief brand officer Marc Pritchard at the four-day Advertising Week conference in New York this week. “But it also has to look like one brand because people have 5,000 ads coming at them every day and that’s 10 times what it was just 10 years ago.” Anna Fieler, chief marketing officer at PopSugar, a women’s shopping and content site, said marketers are devising benchmarks like “sharing velocity” to monitor resonance. “Shareability is the gold standard of how engaged people are,” she said. “People like it so much that they want to share it with someone else.” Not all Ads place the brand front and center. Frito-Lay, which spends about 40 per cent of its advertising budget on digital media, offers tips on its Facebook feed on professional mentoring and networking, in addition to the usual fare of ads that aim to excite and amuse. “People are using social media to build their (personal) brand,” said Jeff Klein, vice president of brands and portfolio marketing. Sometimes Frito-Lay just “takes a little bit of a back seat.” Much of the buzz at the Advertising Week conference was the wildfire growth of video streaming and broadcast of live events. Facebook vice president Will Platt-Higgins predicted video could comprise 80 per cent of all smartphone content by 2020. “You’ve got the perfect marriage of basically a supercomputer, which is in your pocket, plus super powerful wifi, plus a video composer and a high-definition camera,” he said. “All of that together creates the perfect storm for all of us to upload videos like crazy and that’s what’s happening.” (AFP) advertisement In The Headlines 7  hours ago Student loan beneficiaries in for more shock, surprise Higher education loan beneficiaries were in for more surprises yesterday, with some  claiming 5  hours ago Congestion at rapid transit bus stations raises concern City commuters will have to contend with congestion at rapid transit bus stations for much longer News Tanzania seeks ICC reforms   6  hours ago News JPM signs contentious Media Bill into law   6  hours ago International Prince William warns of looming threat of extinction   1 day ago International Fake US election news outshone real on Facebook: report   1 day ago Advertisement Political Reforms WARAH: Making angels out of Africa’s rogue leaders Opinion/Editorial FROM THE PUBLIC EDITOR'S DESK: Scribes’ dilemma: to be or not to be objective Opinion/Editorial WHAT OTHERS SAY: Is Kenya really exceptional in E.Africa?

COTY, +0.38% including the transfer of its global fine fragrances, salon professional, cosmetics and retail hair color businesses, along with select hair styling brands (collectively referred to as “P&G Specialty Beauty Brands”). On September 30, 2016, P&G completed a split-off transaction whereby P&G provided its shareholders with the opportunity to exchange their shares of P&G common stock for Galleria Co. common stock. Effective October 1, 2016, Galleria Co. merged with a subsidiary of Coty and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Coty, whereby Galleria Co. common stock was converted to common stock of Coty Inc. "The completion of this transaction is a key step in our journey to return P&G results to a balance of strong top-line growth, bottom-line growth and cash generation," said David S. Taylor, P&G Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “This effectively completes the major work we undertook two years ago to streamline and strengthen our product portfolio. We are now focused on 10 product categories and about 65 brands where P&G has leading market positions and where product technologies deliver performance differences that matter most to consumers.” “I'm pleased with the timely, efficient and effective transition of these businesses. I want to share my personal thanks to all the employees who have transitioned to Coty,” Taylor added. “They showed amazing dedication during a period of uncertainty—demonstrating time and time again the strong character of P&G people. I thank them for everything they did during the transition and for all their years with P&G and wish them an exciting future with Coty.” As part of the transaction, P&G retired 105.0 million shares of P&G stock, behind the exchange of 409.7 million shares of Galleria Co., which converted into common shares of Coty. At P&G’s closing stock price on Friday, September 30 of $89.75, these shares represent value of $9.4 billion. In addition, Galleria Co. assumed approximately $1.9 billion of debt in the transaction, the proceeds of which were subsequently distributed to P&G prior to the consummation of the split/merger. The combination of the stock retirement and debt proceeds results in a total value of approximately $11.4 billion. Goldman, Sachs & Co. acted as financial advisor, Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP acted as tax counsel, and Jones Day acted as legal counsel to P&G.

Is Losing to the Competition Where P&G falls short against its consumer goods rivals right now. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Oct 2, 2016 at 3:15PM Image source: Procter & Gamble. Procter & Gamble's (NYSE:PG) latest business trends haven't given investors much to cheer about. Organic sales growth slowed for the second straight year in fiscal year 2016, and the consumer goods giant lost market share in four of its five main product categories while holding steady in just one -- its fabric care and home care division. Part of P&G's poor growth can be blamed on a weak selling environment and economic struggles in some of its geographies. Yet the company is also trailing competitors in a head-to-head match up in these important ways. Volume gains The biggest standout when comparing P&G to rivals is its volume figures. Consumer giants typically aim for organic growth that's led by volume gains, or at least includes a healthy mix of volume and pricing upticks that together produce higher sales. Unilever (NYSE:UL) is a great example as it has managed 2.2% improved volume over the past six months that powered organic growth of nearly 5%. In contrast, P&G's volume shrunk by 1% in the 12 months ended this past June, and so the company had to rely exclusively on higher prices to deliver its modest 1% overall organic growth uptick. The good news for shareholders is that a rebound could be in the cards. Volume figures rose last quarter across all of P&G's product divisions, at an average of 2%. That result was still well below Kimberly-Clark's (NYSE:KMB) 4% volume jump, but it does close the gap somewhat. Innovation Innovation is critical to P&G's business since it needs to constantly update existing brands (new and improved) while launching the occasional game-changing product (e.g., Febreze, Swiffer) to stay ahead of rivals. "Winning with consumers around the world and against our best competitors requires innovation," executives explain in the 10-K. "Innovation has always been, and continues to be, P&G's lifeblood." The company has struggled in this area recently. Sure, products like Pampers Swaddlers diapers, Gillette Fusion razors, and Tide Pods detergent are doing well. But P&G hasn't introduced a new hit brand worth over $1 billion in annual sales in more than a decade. Image source: P&G. By contrast, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is on an innovative roll lately. The healthcare titan got one-quarter of its sales last year from products that it introduced in just the past five years, which is a testament to an innovation strategy that's backed by $9 billion of annual spending on research and development -- up 10% since 2013. Compare that to Procter & Gamble's R&D commitment that has held steady at $2 billion in each of the last three years. Value focus By its own admission, P&G hasn't done an especially good job at catering to the value niche of many of its competitive markets. In razors, for example, the company is enjoying strong growth with premium Gillette Fusion products, but at the same time has lost share from price-based competitors like Unilever's Dollar Shave Club. "We need to do more work on the lower end of the portfolio," Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller told investors in a conference call. That weakness has also left P&G vulnerable to store brands that are offered directly from retailers. Wal-Mart recently credited its private label products for helping produce strong growth in its laundry and home care aisles. The same negative dynamic could quickly shift online, where e-commerce giant Amazon.com is eyeing a few of P&G's strongest categories, diapers, and laundry detergent, with its own private label brands. P&G's brand shedding initiative should boost sales growth and profitability. BT: Before Tax. Image source: P&G. P&G executives are taking steps to close the gap against competitors on all these metrics. The company's portfolio reboot initiative, for one, is likely to boost overall volume growth. And major cost cuts should help it compete better on pricing. In fact, progress on these goals recently gave management the confidence to project the first annual uptick in organic sales growth in years. Yet the 2% gain it is forecasting for fiscal year 2017 would still put P&G behind most of its global rivals. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos has no position in any stocks mentioned.

This has already proven good in the short term, but could be even better in the long term. Seth McNew (TMFMcNew) Oct 3, 2016 at 6:03PM Image source: Procter & Gamble. Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) officially completed the sale of 41 beauty brands to competitor Coty (NYSE:COTY) on Sept. 30, a deal that has been inked since summer 2015. The deal had far more investor interest than was anticipated, and P&G stock hit an all-time high of $90 per share on that day. Here's why the deal was a success in the short term, but looks even better in the long term. The final sale Image source: CoverGirl.com. The $11.4 billion deal was a stock swap between the two companies in which P&G investors were allowed to choose if they wanted to tender all or part of their shares into the new company, called Galleria, that will later convert to shares of Coty stock. In the swap, P&G sold off most of its fragrances, salon, cosmetics, and hair-color businesses, including big-name brands like CoverGirl and Clairol. Coty will also take over eight P&G factories and around 10,000 workers, as well as about $2 billion in debt. P&G needed its shareholders to offer up about 100 million shares for conversion, and to make sure it reached that goal, priced the offer at a 7% discount of what the Coty shares were selling for that day. Shareholders combined offered more than 691 million P&G shares for the requested tender -- far more than expected or needed. Now that the sale is complete, P&G will accept the tender offer of about 105 million shares for a total value (including the debt portion) of $11.4 billion. Why the beauty segment was on the chopping block At one point, P&G owned nearly 170 brands. To spur faster earnings growth, management initiated regrowth strategy in 2014 with one overarching goal -- streamlining operations to focus only on the brands with the highest earnings value. Many brands have already been sold off, including some big names like Duracell batteries, which went to Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) earlier this year.  The chart below shows how each of P&G's five segments performed in fiscal year 2016, which ended June 30. P&G's beauty segment was one of its worst-performing areas by sales and organic volume. With this huge sale of brands to Coty, the beauty segment, which was the company's third largest, will become its smallest. By divesting much of this segment, P&G will be able to redirect its efforts, as well as the cash from the deal, to focus on its more successful brands.  Segment Brand Example Total Sales  (FY 2016) Total Sales Growth (YOY) Organic Volume Growth (YOY) Net Earnings Growth From Continuing Operations (YOY) Beauty CoverGirl, Olay $11.5 billion (9%) (2%) (9%) Grooming Gillette $6.8 billion (8%) (2%) (13%) Healthcare Oral-B $7.3 billion (5%) (2%) 7% Fabric and home Tide $20.7 billion (7%) 1% 5% Baby, feminine, and family Pampers $18.5 billion (9% ) (2%) (10%) Data source: P&G fiscal 2016 earnings report. FY = fiscal year. YOY = year over year. Reason to bet on P&G? "Now looking forward, we continue to focus on large opportunities that should be within our control," said Chief Financial Officer Jon R. Moeller in the 2016 year-end earnings call, adding, "executing what is the largest transformation in our company's history: reaccelerating top line growth with strengthened category business models. ... This transformation is aimed at delivering balanced top and bottom line growth and leadership value creation."  So far, P&G's strategy seems to be working, and could get much better from here. Sales for the fiscal year 2016, which ended June 30, dropped from $70 billion to $65 billion as some brands were discontinued, but net income increased 50% year over year. For fiscal year 2017, P&G management has forecast organic sales to grow around 2% companywide, and for earnings per share to grow around 50%. Much of that increase is due to the sale of the 41 brands to Coty. However, with plans for another $10 billion in cost cuts over the next five years, and focusing only on the highest-performing segments, P&G should be able to drive earnings growth for years to come.  Seth McNew has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Reprints Reprints Katy Perry's New Katy Kat Collection Mascara & Matte Lipstick ad Credit: Covergirl/P&G Most Popular Now that Procter & Gamble Co. has divested a big chunk of its beauty business to Coty, the deal appears to leave WPP's Grey in the middle of a somewhat uncomfortable conflict. Grey continues to handle P&G's Pantene hair care, and also handles the CoverGirl, Clairol, Wella retail and some fragrance brands that went to Coty under a spinoff-merger transaction completed today. While there's relatively little competitive overlap between the P&G brands Coty has gotten and the Pantene brand P&G is keeping, there is some. P&G's Pantene and Coty's Wella and Clairol all sell shampoo and conditioner, the latter technically only through professional and salon channels, though diversion means they sometimes end up on shelves of the same retailers carrying Pantene. It's enough proximity to trigger a conflict under P&G's policy, which generally prohibits businesses that compete with or potentially could compete with P&G brands from being handled within the same agency network, though in some cases it's possible to segment the work in different offices of the same agency. With both businesses being global, the latter may be difficult. "We've been in discussions with the agencies for the past several months on how to work through the conflicts, and we're confident we'll be able to achieve the needed separation for competitive considerations," a P&G spokeswoman said in a statement. She added that P&G doesn't expect an immediate change and will "work with the agencies over the course of several additional months on any actions needed to ensure a smooth transition." It's less clear if the deal creates any conflict issues under Coty policy. A spokeswoman for Coty said in an email: "We intend to work closely with Grey following the completion of the merger to address any potential conflict, ensure respect of appropriate business conduct principles and ensure a smooth transition." A spokesman for Grey referred calls to P&G and Coty. The media side was less complicated. Publicis Groupe's Starcom Mediavest Group retained the North American media business of the P&G brands heading to Coty following P&G's review last year, though the rest of the P&G business went to other agencies. And Publicis' ZenithOptimedia Group also won a Coty global media review last year. Last month, Publicis Groupe announced the Coty business would be consolidated with Zenith globally. Coty also has an in-house digital and content agency, Beamly, acquired last year, but there's no indication it plans to shift any creative work there from Grey. While the former P&G brands have changed hands, there are familiar faces running the business at Coty too, including longtime P&G executive Esi Eggleston Bracey, named president-Coty consumer beauty last year.

Ten years ago, Pantene created the Pantene Beautiful Lengths program, which strives to create free, real-hair wigs for women who have lost their hair due to cancer treatment. With the help of charitable men, women and children, the Pantene Beautiful Lengths program has created more than 46,000 wigs to-date. Most recently, the Pantene Beautiful Lengths Fund was created for those who want to support the program, but are unable to donate their hair. “We’re so thankful that so many people have supported the Pantene Beautiful Lengths program for 10 years, and are grateful to Walgreens for their gracious donation to help create these wigs. Women have a very special relationship with their hair—it plays a huge role in defining who they are as individuals,” says Jodi Allen, Vice President of P&G Hair Care & Color for North America Pantene. “This program has inspired so many to make selfless donations over the years, and it’s because of them, that women who have lost their hair due to cancer treatments are able to feel more like themselves every day.” Get Involved Pantene Beautiful Lengths and Walgreens encourage everyone to contribute to the Pantene Beautiful Lengths Fund. Contributions made to the Fund go directly to helping create free, real-hair wigs for women battling cancer. Visit www.gcfdn.org/pantene for more details. You can also find more information and Pantene products at your local Walgreens. Share your donation on social media and encourage your friends and family to participate by using #BeautifulLengths, tagging @Pantene and @Walgreens. About Pantene Beautiful Lengths and the Pantene Beautiful Lengths Fund Since its creation in 2006, Pantene Beautiful Lengths has provided the funds to create more than 46,000 free, real-hair wigs which are distributed through select American Cancer Society wig banks across the country. The Pantene Beautiful Lengths Fund works with the non-profit organization The Greater Cincinnati Foundation, which accepts monetary donations, allowing anyone to support the Pantene Beautiful Lengths program. Many of the women helped say that putting on a wig makes them feel like themselves again during the toughest fight of their lives and when people across the country donate to Pantene Beautiful Lengths, they are helping make that happen.

(NYSE: PG) announced that it had transferred its specialty beauty business to Coty Inc. (NYSE: COTY) in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction. Assets transferred include its global fine fragrances, salon professional, cosmetics and retail hair color businesses, as well as select hair styling brands. Procter & Gamble Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer David S. Taylor said: The completion of this transaction is a key step in our journey to return P&G results to a balance of strong top-line growth, bottom-line growth and cash generation. This effectively completes the major work we undertook two years ago to streamline and strengthen our product portfolio. We are now focused on 10 product categories and about 65 brands where P&G has leading market positions and where product technologies deliver performance differences that matter most to consumers. As part of the transaction, the company retired 105.0 million shares of its stock. At the closing share price on Friday, September 30, of $89.75, that was worth some $9.4 billion. Many on Wall Street feel that the new focus on a slimmed down product portfolio will help spur earnings growth and return the company to its long-time premium consumer staples multiple. Some analyst estimates for the next two years are 2% above current Wall Street expectations, and the company posted solid earnings in the most recent quarter. In addition, 24/7 Wall St. recently noted that Procter & Gamble remains one of the Dividend Aristocrats; that is, S&P 500 companies with a history of raising their dividends for 25 years or more. The company most recently hiked its dividend in April 2016, which marked the 60th consecutive year that the consumer products giant had increased its dividend. The company actually has been paying a dividend for 126 consecutive years, since its incorporation in 1890. Also note that the number of Procter & Gamble shares short surged about 186% in early September, though that was not quite enough to lift it into the top 10 most shorted stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The 81.26 million shares short as of the most recent settlement date represented 3.1% of the total float. As mentioned, Procter & Gamble shares closed most recently at $89.75. The dividend yield is 2.9% and the market cap is nearly $240 billion. The stock has a consensus price target of about $93 and a 52-week range of $72.50 to $90.22. Investors might want to take note that this high is an all-time high.

AFP 03 October 2016 - 14:57 print comments Ever-changing mobile landscape © (Shutterstock.com) NEW YORK - Almost 80 years old, the deodorant Old Spice is learning new tricks for finding customers in the era of smartphones and social media. The Procter & Gamble product, having spoofed itself for years with advice on how to become more "mantastic," posts to its 2.6 million Facebook followers a steady stream of video games, prize entries, and advertisements as short as two seconds. Creating "thumb-stopping" content is the goal, and marketers are doing everything they can to achieve it. That includes using neuroscience to study which visual and audio cues offer the best bet to grabbing and keeping an impatient smartphone user's attention. Estimates show that the average person looks at his or her smartphone as much as 150 times a day. The attention is there, but it's just not long-lived. "You get the three-second audition," said Frank Amorese, media director at Heineken USA. "If you are relying on the 14th or 15th second to do the heavy lifting of the ad, it's not going to work." Ever-changing mobile landscape Advertisers are in a dizzying race to connect with customers as new mobile-borne social media platforms emerge and evolve. "The landscape changes every six months," Amorese said. "It's changing at an increasingly fast rate." Digital ad spending is projected to reach $72.1 billion in 2016, growing at a rate of 21 percent and now comprising almost 37 percent of the overall market, according to eMarketer. Social media accounts for $15.4 billion of this. Heineken has doubled its spending on digital ads to 30 percent over the last five years. The dominance of smaller mobile devices has heightened the challenge of capturing the attention of potential shoppers. Ads must be tailored depending on whether they are being seen on a widescreen television, a tablet or a smartphone and must not demand too much time if a consumer is merely glancing at a feed and not planning on a lengthy stay. "We have to really identify how do consumers engage with every single platform and then what is the creative experience we need to give them," said P&G chief brand officer Marc Pritchard at the four-day Advertising Week conference in New York this week. "But it also has to look like one brand because people have 5,000 ads coming at them every day and that's 10 times what it was just 10 years ago." Measuring 'sharing velocity' Anna Fieler, chief marketing officer at PopSugar, a women's shopping and content site, said marketers are devising benchmarks like "sharing velocity" to monitor resonance. "Shareability is the gold standard of how engaged people are," she said. "People like it so much that they want to share it with someone else." Not all Ads place the brand front and center. Frito-Lay, which spends about 40 percent of its advertising budget on digital media, offers tips on its Facebook feed on professional mentoring and networking, in addition to the usual fare of ads that aim to excite and amuse. "People are using social media to build their (personal) brand," said Jeff Klein, vice president of brands and  portfolio marketing. Sometimes Frito-Lay just "takes a little bit of a back seat." 'Upload videos like crazy' Much of the buzz at the Advertising Week  conference was the wildfire growth of video streaming and broadcast of live events. Facebook vice president Will Platt-Higgins predicted video could comprise 80 percent of all smartphone content by 2020. "You've got the perfect marriage of basically a supercomputer, which is in your pocket, plus super powerful wifi, plus a video composer and a high-definition camera," he said. "All of that together creates the perfect storm for all of us to upload videos like crazy and that's what's happening." The growth of video also opens up new opportunity  for rivals like Twitter, which has lagged Facebook in terms of building profits from ads. Twitter posted 18 percent growth in advertising revenue last quarter spurred by video. It is betting that marketers will see more upside in plans for live events in pro football and other sports. Video "is the number one ad format for us now and it barely existed a year ago," said Matt Derella, vice president of global revenue and operations at Twitter. "It's risen extremely fast and it's driven by consumer behavior."

Commenting, Pane said, “It is my great privilege to take over the reins of leadership at such a transformational moment. Today marks a new chapter in Coty’s rich heritage. With this merger, we have brought together a powerful portfolio of much loved beauty brands and some of the world’s most talented people in beauty and consumer goods. I believe this combination, together with our distinctive entrepreneurial culture, focused and lean operating structure, and efficient earnings model, will enable Coty to be a challenger in the beauty industry. We aim to relentlessly pursue superior products and solutions, build brands that inspire and enable consumers to celebrate and liberate their own individual beauty.” Bart Becht, Chairman of Coty’s Board of Directors, said, “Coty is now better positioned as we aim to become, over time, a global industry leader by being a clear challenger in beauty, delighting our consumers and creating long term shareholder value. I am confident that we now have a much improved team, structure and culture to make the vision of this merger a reality. I look forward to continuing to work with the new leadership team in my role as Chairman to drive Coty to in-market success and profitable growth.” Consumer-Centric Organizational Structure, with Iconic Brands Coty is organized into three divisions: Coty Consumer Beauty, Coty Luxury and Coty Professional Beauty, each focused on their respective categories and channels, with a lean structure that enables faster decision making, focused investments and better communication with customers and consumers. Coty Consumer Beauty is focused on color cosmetics, retail hair coloring and styling products, body care and mass fragrances, with the intent of providing consumers with innovative products primarily in the mass retail channel. Its iconic brand portfolio includes Adidas, Bourjois, Clairol, COVERGIRL, David Beckham, Katy Perry, Max Factor, Rimmel, Sally Hansen and Wella. Coty Luxury is focused on expanding Coty’s leadership position in prestige fragrances and emerging position in skincare, in the Luxury Beauty market across all regions and luxury channels, including travel retail. Its fragrances include such well-known brands as Marc Jacobs, Calvin Klein, Chloé, Gucci, Hugo Boss, Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, Alexander McQueen, Davidoff and Miu Miu, amongst others, and skincare brands include Lancaster and philosophy. Coty Professional Beauty is focused on servicing salon owners and professionals in both hair and nail care, covering all key salon segments and salon client needs. The professional-focused brands include Clairol Professional, Nioxin, OPI, Sebastian Professional, System Professional and Wella Professionals. Financial Benefits of Transaction Coty aims to achieve a best-in-class profit margin and cash flow conversion model in an industry with attractive growth dynamics and modest private label penetration. Coty expects to achieve total cost savings of approximately $750 [1] , million or 16% [1] of acquired revenues, through the transaction composed of: initial synergies, reflecting P&G costs that will not transfer, of approximately $350 million; and incremental cost synergies, to be recognized over four years, of approximately $400 million, achieved through a range of efficiency opportunities that the combination of the two businesses create. The merger synergies are expected to enhance Coty’s already strong margins, cash flow generation and earnings power. Including anticipated synergies, Coty expects the P&G Specialty Beauty Business merger to: Add approximately 500 to 600 basis points to Coty’s stand-alone adjusted operating profit margins over a four-year period, resulting in margins of approximately 19.6% which would make Coty a margin leader relative to its Beauty peers. Drive a pro forma increase to Coty’s fiscal year 2016 adjusted earnings per share base of approximately $0.48, including the assumed four year implementation of full run-rate synergies. Generate close to $1 billion in free cash flow by year two. Financing At the close of the transaction, Coty will assume approximately $1.9 billion of debt of the P&G Specialty Beauty Business. On a combined basis, the business at close is expected to have moderate pro forma debt leverage of approximately 3.5x net debt / Adjusted EBITDA, providing ample cash flow for the enhanced annual dividend of $0.50 per share, while preserving strategic flexibility. Outlook for Fiscal 2017 As previously communicated, Coty anticipates that the first half revenue trend will be below prior year results and the results for the combined company, as Coty continues to make strategic choices to build a better business, including rationalizing wholesale distribution, and as resources which normally work on the business have been working on closing the transaction and the future of the combined company. Coty remains committed to return the Coty business back to growth in the second six month period and is targeting to strengthen Coty’s growth rate in the following fiscal years. Coty Heritage Coty has a unique and long standing heritage of entrepreneurs, upon which the culture of the new Coty is being modeled. François Coty started his fragrance business more than 100 years ago by making perfume accessible to the general public for the first time and creating the modern fragrance category. Eugene Rimmel brought the world the first non-toxic mascara, Max Factor coined the term “make-up,” Sally Hansen pioneered nail care and Wella was the first professional hairdressing company. All of these entrepreneurs will form the inspiration for the new Coty company to bring new innovative beauty products to consumers and drive shareholder value over time. Advisors Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC served as lead financial advisor to Coty. Barclays, J.P. Morgan and BofA Merrill Lynch also acted as financial advisors, with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP serving as legal counsel, McDermott Will & Emery LLP serving as tax and U.S. antitrust counsel and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer serving as non-U.S. antitrust counsel. ---//--- Note to editors – About Camillo Pane: Camillo Pane is a global consumer goods veteran and a proven leader with a strong track record for delivering business performance.

More information about potential risks and uncertainties that could affect Coty’s business and financial results is included under “Risk Factors” and “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Coty’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, and under “Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements”, “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of P&G Beauty Brands” in Coty’s Registration Statement on Form S-4 filed on April 22, 2016, including any amendments thereto, and other periodic reports Coty may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. Coty assumes no responsibility to update forward-looking statements made herein or otherwise, except as required by law. Non-GAAP Measures In this document, Coty presents adjusted operating profit margin, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe better enable management and investors to analyze and compare the underlying business results from period to period. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Coty does not provide reconciliations of such forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation, including adjustments that could be made for restructuring, integration and acquisition-related expenses, amortization expenses, adjustments to inventory, and other charges reflected in our reconciliation of historic numbers, the amount of which, based on historical experience, could be significant.

According to an industry study done by the video intelligence company Vidooly, Hindustan Unilever (HUL) is India's most viewed Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) brand on YouTube. HUL emerged as the leading FMCG brand with over 238 million views on video sharing platforms such as YouTube. The study by Vidooly was conducted across five leading FMCG brands in India. The brands were HUL, Proctor & Gamble (P&G), Nestle India, ITC, and the Godrej Group. HUL (238.7 million views) is closely followed by P&G with 238.05 million views across YouTube. Nestle India comes third with an average of 74 million views across social media. ITC and the Godrej Group take the fourth and fifth spot with 23 million views and 18 million views online respectively. Talking about the research, Nishant Radia, CMO and co-founder of Vidooly, says, "YouTube is the largest video platform in the world. Most FMCG brands not only host their ad campaigns on their YouTube channel, but also use YouTube as a strategic platform to engage with their consumer base. Younger audiences are increasingly consuming video content on YouTube, hence, FMCG brands are directing a major chunk of their digital ad spends to YouTube with engaging and original content." Within HUL's portfolio, Lakme had the highest number of views, while Gillette has the highest number of views in P&G's portfolio. In terms of number of views, Nescafe, Yippee, and Godrej Cinthol followed in that order. Indians spent over 4,00,000 hours watching YouTube ads this year according to a statement by Google. And, with cheaper data plans and wider availability of 4G ready smartphones, more people are consuming video content on their smartphones. 85SHARES Follow afaqs!

Finance Search Sat, Nov 19, 2016, 3:38 AM AEDT - Australia Markets closed Advertising on mobile: it's all about 'stopping the thumb'By John Biers | AFP – Sun, Oct 2, 2016 4:36 AM AEDT Recommend 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print Related Content View Photo Advertisers are in a dizzying race to connect with customers as new mobile-borne social media platforms emerge and evolve Almost 80 years old, the deodorant Old Spice is learning new tricks for finding customers in the era of smartphones and social media. The Procter & Gamble product, having spoofed itself for years with advice on how to become more "mantastic," posts to its 2.6 million Facebook followers a steady stream of video games, prize entries, and advertisements as short as two seconds. Creating "thumb-stopping" content is the goal, and marketers are doing everything they can to achieve it. That includes using neuroscience to study which visual and audio cues offer the best bet to grabbing and keeping an impatient smartphone user's attention. Estimates show that the average person looks at his or her smartphone as much as 150 times a day. The attention is there, but it's just not long-lived. "You get the three-second audition," said Frank Amorese, media director at Heineken USA. "If you are relying on the 14th or 15th second to do the heavy lifting of the ad, it's not going to work." - Ever-changing mobile landscape - Advertisers are in a dizzying race to connect with customers as new mobile-borne social media platforms emerge and evolve. "The landscape changes every six months," Amorese said. "It's changing at an increasingly fast rate." Digital ad spending is projected to reach $72.1 billion in 2016, growing at a rate of 21 percent and now comprising almost 37 percent of the overall market, according to eMarketer. Social media accounts for $15.4 billion of this. Heineken has doubled its spending on digital ads to 30 percent over the last five years. The dominance of smaller mobile devices has heightened the challenge of capturing the attention of potential shoppers. Ads must be tailored depending on whether they are being seen on a widescreen television, a tablet or a smartphone and must not demand too much time if a consumer is merely glancing at a feed and not planning on a lengthy stay. "We have to really identify how do consumers engage with every single platform and then what is the creative experience we need to give them," said P&G chief brand officer Marc Pritchard at the four-day Advertising Week conference in New York this week. "But it also has to look like one brand because people have 5,000 ads coming at them every day and that's 10 times what it was just 10 years ago." - Measuring 'sharing velocity' - Anna Fieler, chief marketing officer at PopSugar, a women's shopping and content site, said marketers are devising benchmarks like "sharing velocity" to monitor resonance. "Shareability is the gold standard of how engaged people are," she said. "People like it so much that they want to share it with someone else." Not all Ads place the brand front and center. Frito-Lay, which spends about 40 percent of its advertising budget on digital media, offers tips on its Facebook feed on professional mentoring and networking, in addition to the usual fare of ads that aim to excite and amuse. "People are using social media to build their (personal) brand," said Jeff Klein, vice president of brands and portfolio marketing. Sometimes Frito-Lay just "takes a little bit of a back seat." - 'Upload videos like crazy' - Much of the buzz at the Advertising Week conference was the wildfire growth of video streaming and broadcast of live events. Facebook vice president Will Platt-Higgins predicted video could comprise 80 percent of all smartphone content by 2020. "You've got the perfect marriage of basically a supercomputer, which is in your pocket, plus super powerful wifi, plus a video composer and a high-definition camera," he said. "All of that together creates the perfect storm for all of us to upload videos like crazy and that's what's happening." The growth of video also opens up new opportunity for rivals like Twitter, which has lagged Facebook in terms of building profits from ads. Twitter posted 18 percent growth in advertising revenue last quarter spurred by video. It is betting that marketers will see more upside in plans for live events in pro football and other sports. Video "is the number one ad format for us now and it barely existed a year ago," said Matt Derella, vice president of global revenue and operations at Twitter.

Leisure Home LBoard ‘We can’t stop Umno members, who belong to NGOs, taking part’ Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Advertising on mobile: it’s all about ‘stopping the thumb’ AFP | October 2, 2016 Creating "thumb-stopping" content is the goal, and marketers are doing everything they can to achieve it. NEW YORK: Almost 80 years old, the deodorant Old Spice is learning new tricks for finding customers in the era of smartphones and social media. The Procter & Gamble product, having spoofed itself for years with advice on how to become more “mantastic,” posts to its 2.6 million Facebook followers a steady stream of video games, prize entries, and advertisements as short as two seconds. Creating “thumb-stopping” content is the goal, and marketers are doing everything they can to achieve it. That includes using neuroscience to study which visual and audio cues offer the best bet to grabbing and keeping an impatient smartphone user’s attention. Estimates show that the average person looks at his or her smartphone as much as 150 times a day. The attention is there, but it’s just not long-lived. “You get the three-second audition,” said Frank Amorese, media director at Heineken USA. “If you are relying on the 14th or 15th second to do the heavy lifting of the ad, it’s not going to work.” Ever-changing mobile landscape Advertisers are in a dizzying race to connect with customers as new mobile-borne social media platforms emerge and evolve. “The landscape changes every six months,” Amorese said. “It’s changing at an increasingly fast rate.” Digital ad spending is projected to reach $72.1 billion in 2016, growing at a rate of 21 percent and now comprising almost 37 percent of the overall market, according to eMarketer. Social media accounts for $15.4 billion of this. Heineken has doubled its spending on digital ads to 30 percent over the last five years. The dominance of smaller mobile devices has heightened the challenge of capturing the attention of potential shoppers. Ads must be tailored depending on whether they are being seen on a widescreen television, a tablet or a smartphone and must not demand too much time if a consumer is merely glancing at a feed and not planning on a lengthy stay. “We have to really identify how do consumers engage with every single platform and then what is the creative experience we need to give them,” said P&G chief brand officer Marc Pritchard at the four-day Advertising Week conference in New York this week. “But it also has to look like one brand because people have 5,000 ads coming at them every day and that’s 10 times what it was just 10 years ago.” Measuring ‘sharing velocity’ Anna Fieler, chief marketing officer at PopSugar, a women’s shopping and content site, said marketers are devising benchmarks like “sharing velocity” to monitor resonance. “Shareability is the gold standard of how engaged people are,” she said. “People like it so much that they want to share it with someone else.” Not all Ads place the brand front and center. Frito-Lay, which spends about 40 percent of its advertising budget on digital media, offers tips on its Facebook feed on professional mentoring and networking, in addition to the usual fare of ads that aim to excite and amuse. “People are using social media to build their (personal) brand,” said Jeff Klein, vice president of brands and portfolio marketing. Sometimes Frito-Lay just “takes a little bit of a back seat.” ‘Upload videos like crazy’ Much of the buzz at the Advertising Week conference was the wildfire growth of video streaming and broadcast of live events. Facebook vice president Will Platt-Higgins predicted video could comprise 80 percent of all smartphone content by 2020. “You’ve got the perfect marriage of basically a supercomputer, which is in your pocket, plus super powerful wifi, plus a video composer and a high-definition camera,” he said. “All of that together creates the perfect storm for all of us to upload videos like crazy and that’s what’s happening.” The growth of video also opens up new opportunity for rivals like Twitter, which has lagged Facebook in terms of building profits from ads. Twitter posted 18 percent growth in advertising revenue last quarter spurred by video. It is betting that marketers will see more upside in plans for live events in pro football and other sports. Video “is the number one ad format for us now and it barely existed a year ago,” said Matt Derella, vice president of global revenue and operations at Twitter. “It’s risen extremely fast and it’s driven by consumer behavior.” Comments Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story.

The attention is there, but it’s just not long-lived. “You get the three-second audition,” said Frank Amorese, media director at Heineken USA. “If you are relying on the 14th or 15th second to do the heavy lifting of the ad, it’s not going to work.” Ever-changing mobile landscape Advertisers are in a dizzying race to connect with customers as new mobile-borne social media platforms emerge and evolve. “The landscape changes every six months,” Amorese said. “It’s changing at an increasingly fast rate.” Digital ad spending is projected to reach US$72.1 billion (RM297.4 billion) in 2016, growing at a rate of 21 per cent and now comprising almost 37 per cent of the overall market, according to eMarketer. Social media accounts for US$15.4 billion of this.  Heineken has doubled its spending on digital ads to 30 per cent over the last five years. The dominance of smaller mobile devices has heightened the challenge of capturing the attention of potential shoppers. Ads must be tailored depending on whether they are being seen on a widescreen television, a tablet or a smartphone and must not demand too much time if a consumer is merely glancing at a feed and not planning on a lengthy stay. “We have to really identify how do consumers engage with every single platform and then what is the creative experience we need to give them,” said P& G chief brand officer Marc Pritchard at the four-day Advertising Week conference in New York this week. “But it also has to look like one brand because people have 5,000 ads coming at them every day and that’s 10 times what it was just 10 years ago.” Measuring ‘sharing velocity’ Anna Fieler, chief marketing officer at PopSugar, a women’s shopping and content site, said marketers are devising benchmarks like “sharing velocity” to monitor resonance. “Shareability is the gold standard of how engaged people are,” she said. “People like it so much that they want to share it with someone else.” Not all Ads place the brand front and centre. Frito-Lay, which spends about 40 per cent of its advertising budget on digital media, offers tips on its Facebook feed on professional mentoring and networking, in addition to the usual fare of ads that aim to excite and amuse. “People are using social media to build their (personal) brand,” said Jeff Klein, vice president of brands and  portfolio marketing. Sometimes Frito-Lay just “takes a little bit of a back seat.” ‘Upload videos like crazy’ Much of the buzz at the Advertising Week  conference was the wildfire growth of video streaming and broadcast of live events.  Facebook vice president Will Platt-Higgins predicted video could comprise 80 per cent of all smartphone content by 2020. “You’ve got the perfect marriage of basically a supercomputer, which is in your pocket, plus super powerful wifi, plus a video composer and a high-definition camera,” he said.  “All of that together creates the perfect storm for all of us to upload videos like crazy and that’s what’s happening.” The growth of video also opens up new opportunity for rivals like Twitter, which has lagged Facebook in terms of building profits from ads.  Twitter posted 18 per cent growth in advertising revenue last quarter spurred by video. It is betting that marketers will see more upside in plans for live events in pro football and other sports. Video “is the number one ad format for us now and it barely existed a year ago,” said Matt Derella, vice president of global revenue and operations at Twitter. “It’s risen extremely fast and it’s driven by consumer behaviour.” ― AFP                 MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Facebook fake news writer on how he possibly influenced the US election How Twitter, Instagram and Facebook are stepping up measures to fight online abuse (VIDEO) Soar above the planet’s most spectacular sights with Google Earth VR (VIDEO) Pushing the limits of science at the first Cyborg Olympics (VIDEO) Twitter CEO apologises for allowing white supremacist ad Sony’s PS3 celebrates 10-year anniversary WhatsApp joins rivals from Snapchat to WeChat in video calls Facebook accidentally declares some users dead, including founder Zuckerberg Tinder launches transgender-inclusive update, allowing users to select personalised gender identity (VIDEO) Best smartphones for holiday 2016 Most Watched Now Week Britney Spears, TInashe get down for a ‘Slumber Party’ (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) A Tribe Called Quest spit fire in ‘We the People’ (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Bloomberg Video: Resurrecting Jaguar’s legendary XKSS supercar Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Reuters Video: Thailand sinks boats to tackle illegal fishing Related Articles Snapchat has 60 million daily users in world’s biggest ad market Facebook admits it gave advertisers inflated video view metrics (VIDEO) How Snapchat helped ad buyers get over their fear of a ghost Childless women to marketers: We buy things too Meet the Mill Blackbird, a revolution in car advertising (VIDEO) Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

An Institute for Supply Management report showed its index of national factory activity rose to 51.5 in September, up from 49.4 in August. A reading above 50 signals expansion. The September reading exceeded expectations from economists in separate Bloomberg and Reuters polls. Wall Street fell. In 2.06pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index also declined 0.3 percent. In 1.54pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.5 percent. The Dow moved lower as declines in shares of Travelers and those of Procter & Gamble, last down 1.5 percent and 1.4 percent respectively, outweighed gains in shares of DuPont and those of United Technologies, recently up 2 percent and 0.6 percent respectively. US Treasuries dropped, pushing yields on the 10-year note two basis points higher to 1.62 percent. Investors are focused on this week’s US jobs data, especially Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report. “Markets are warming up to the idea that the Fed is going to hike rates,” John Canally, chief economic strategist at LPL Financial in Boston, told Bloomberg. Meanwhile, shares of Cabela's jumped, trading 14.7 percent higher at US$63.00 as of 2.04pm in New York, after the company said it agreed to be acquired by Bass Pro Shops in a deal valued at about US$5.5 billion. Bass Pro Shops will pay US$65.50 a share in cash, Cabela’s said. The US-listed shares of Deutsche Bank slid 2.1 percent in afternoon trade as the German lender seeks to negotiate a settlement over the sale of residential mortgage securities with the Department of Justice. A number of Deutsche Bank executives are due to be in the US this week in part for the International Monetary Fund’s annual meeting in Washington. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with an advance of 0.1 percent. France’s CAC 40 Index edged 0.1 percent higher, and the UK’s FTSE 100 Index climbed 1.2 percent. German markets were closed for a holiday. While UK stocks rose, the pound slid after Prime Minister Theresa May said she'll start the two-year process to take the UK out of the European Union, or Brexit, by the end of March. “Europe feels a little cautious,” said Chris Beauchamp, a market analyst at IG in London, told Bloomberg. “The market is taking cues from any newsflow around banks, and the problem was that there wasn’t really anything concrete over the weekend. That means panic could still spike again and German stocks are ripe for some weakness [on Tuesday]. The FTSE 100 is in its own world with the lower pound, which might provide a useful dynamic going into the last quarter.” (BusinessDesk) © Scoop Media BusinessDesk Independent, Trustworthy New Zealand Business News The Wellington-based BusinessDesk team led by former Bloomberg Asian top editor Jonathan Underhill and Qantas Award-winning journalist and commentator Pattrick Smellie provides a daily news feed for a serious business audience.

While UK stocks rose, the pound slid after Prime Minister Theresa May said she’ll start the two-year process to take the UK out of the European Union, or Brexit, by the end of March. “Europe feels a little cautious,” said Chris Beauchamp, a market analyst at IG in London, told Bloomberg. “The market is taking cues from any newsflow around banks, and the problem was that there wasn’t really anything concrete over the weekend. That means panic could still spike again and German stocks are ripe for some weakness [on Tuesday]. The FTSE 100 is in its own world with the lower pound, which might provide a useful dynamic going into the last quarter.” (BusinessDesk) Content Sourced from scoop.co.nz Original url  Print This Post Tweet     Blogroll China Economic Scan Compare house prices Deposit Rates Direct Broking – NZX & ASX Trading & Prices Findata – Market Data Good Returns Herald Business Interest.co.nz – Interest Rates News & Views National Business Review Property Talk Sharechat Stuff Business Value Cruncher – NZX Latest Business news Sentence sends message to keep housing market honest South Island highways update – 7:00pm Friday 18 November Kaikoura Emergency Access Road remains closed MTF lifts full-year sales, underlying profit falls MARKET CLOSE: NZ shares rise, led by Auckland Airport Ports of Auckland does deal with KiwiRail NZ dollar dips below 70 US cents, as market adjusts to Trump Tenon shareholders approve sale of US business Four Square Raglan to the rescue with much needed water Kaibosh evacuated but trucking on Kaikoura earthquake – Expert reaction 8 Once ‘Bad’ Russia is Now ‘Good’ as PM Flip Flops Again Earthquake and tsunami, genes, and spin off to science MPI boosts surveillance around Kaikoura coast Kiwis rally in support of Vodafone boost Text Links Recent Comments Lan: Unbelievable that a WEST AUSTR... jackp: Murray, when Key is involved t...

The S&P 500 healthcare index fell 0.7 percent, the most among the 10 major S&P indexes that were lower, due to declines in Pfizer and Merck. Consumer staples fell 0.59 percent, dragged down by Procter & Gamble and PepsiCo. The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) from the Institute of Supply Management is expected to show that factory activity expanded in September after having contracted in August. Investors are also on the lookout for news from Deutsche Bank, which is working to reach a settlement with U.S. authorities who have demanded a fine of up to $14 billion from the bank for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities. While the bank's Frankfurt-listed stock was not trading due to a public holiday, its U.S.-listed shares were down 1.2 percent at $12.96 on Monday. The travails of Germany's biggest lender has unsettled investors who are now awaiting third-quarter corporate earnings and the upcoming U.S. presidential election. "It looks like a quiet start to the day and that's not surprising," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Equity Capital Markets in New York. "It's a back-end loaded week with jobs numbers on Friday, but if we get a positive read on ISM manufacturing, we could say that August was a blip and that will be constructive for the markets today." A report on monthly hiring activity on Friday will be assessed by investors as it will play a big role in the Federal Reserve's decision on raising interest rates this year. At 9:37 a.m. ET (1337 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 79.3 points, or 0.43 percent, at 18,228.85. The S&P 500 was down 7.33 points, or 0.34 percent, at 2,160.94 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 8.31 points, or 0.16 percent, at 5,303.69. Tesla shares rose 2.3 percent to $208.82 after the electric carmaker said third-quarter deliveries rose by 70 percent to 24,500 cars. Janus Capital soared 17 percent after the asset manager said it had agreed to an all-share $6 billion merger with London-listed rival Henderson Global. Cabela's surged 14.5 percent to $62.90 after the company said it would be acquired by Bass Pro Shops in a deal valued at about $5.5 billion. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,585 to 1,038. On the Nasdaq, 1,343 issues fell and 936 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed two new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 23 new highs and seven new lows.

Awards AToMiC Awards Shopper Innovation Awards Strategy   Home Calendar Awards Magazine Screening Room Careers Categories Branding Media Retail Youth Research Innovation Industry Moves Shopper Marketing Home » Agencies, Branding » Why agencies compete on price Former Cadbury marketer and current CASSIES editor John Bradley on how to solve the price war problem. By Strategy Staff October 2, 2016 One thing I hear frequently from senior agency leaders these days is how clients are constantly demanding more service for lower fees (usually in a tone that implies said clients are nothing more than ungrateful, mentally challenged, penny pinching wretches). Perhaps not unnaturally, given my client background, I take a different view. I think such behaviour is inevitable given that the market for ad agencies bears all the hallmarks of one that competes almost entirely on price. Price competition is not an aberration in markets; it’s the default competition mechanism unless strategies are employed to avoid it. We clients have wrestled with this beast for more than a century. One route is to have a commonly agreed upon pricing mechanism. This is what kept ad agency fees out of price competition for most of the 20th century, with compensation at a fixed percentage of media spend, and it’s a mechanism that keeps realtors in BMWs to this day. But there is a vulnerability: players losing market share can also lose their nerve. When that dam burst during the 1990s, price competition took hold. Procter & Gamble’s and Lever Bros.’ response to having more than 400 price-cutting competing firms to deal with in the early 20th century U.S. soap market was to buy most of them up. This approach is somewhat reminiscent of that employed more recently by WPP, Omnicom, Publicis and Interpublic. However, it did – and still does – create a new problem: what to do with the vast brand portfolios that result? The agency world has largely taken the route that Lever took: benign internal competition. But that never really solves the price war problem, which can remain rampant between the larger groupings. The only truly effective, enduring and legal solution to competing on price came from the P&G market statistics department, where it became apparent to then-president Neil McElroy that the Camay brand was losing sales – not to Lever Bros., but to P&G’s own Ivory soap. His solution – brand management – led quickly to the price war-avoiding Holy Grail of segmentation. By targeting Camay at one cleansing need and Ivory at another, both could happily occupy different price points. Prior to this, all soaps had targeted every cleansing need, leaving price as the decider – a bit like all agencies targeting every client. At first glance, it seems this segmentation can’t work in the agency world. Position yourself as the agency specializing in auto accounts and, thanks to client conflict concerns, you will only ever have one account. However, you can regain pricing control by deciding the part of the customer proposition you will be the best at, protecting you from price competition with the customers who most value that attribute. Thus, L’Oréal and Estée Lauder compete by specializing in different components of the cosmetics offer: L’Oréal is unbeatable on science, while Estée Lauder is unbeatable on service. Can this work in the agency world? Yes, it can, but it’s currently found mostly within small, young agencies. Such agencies, due to the background and expertise of the founder(s), tend to have a unique approach to, and be uncommonly good at, a certain part of the job, be it planning, brand turnarounds, digital or whatever. If you as a client desperately seek that attribute, then, within reason, you will pay their price. Maintaining that expertise as the agency grows is the banana skin. Agencies don’t grow organically, they grow in big leaps: win a big account and you have to recruit 50 people pronto. Making the areas of uniqueness part of the DNA of the agency is next to impossible when talent is almost always imported en masse. Should that pitfall be avoided, the founders cashing out invariably signals the beginning of the end. A necessary component of any successful segmentation strategy is having the nerve to not try to be good at everything; it didn’t work for Ivory soap and it doesn’t work now. Unless you can identify areas you are not going to focus on, and demonstrate why you are the best at what you will focus on, you don’t have a strategy and will keep dropping your shorts on price. John Bradley is a former VP, marketing for Cadbury. He’s now an author and judging coordinator for the CASSIES.

While the bank's Frankfurt-listed stock was not trading due to a public holiday, its U.S.-listed shares were down 1.2 percent at $12.96 on Monday. The travails of Germany's biggest lender has unsettled investors who are now awaiting third-quarter corporate earnings and the upcoming U.S. presidential election. "It looks like a quiet start to the day and that's not surprising," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Equity Capital Markets in New York. "It's a back-end loaded week with jobs numbers on Friday, but if we get a positive read on ISM manufacturing, we could say that August was a blip and that will be constructive for the markets today." A report on monthly hiring activity on Friday will be assessed by investors as it will play a big role in the Federal Reserve's decision on raising interest rates this year. At 9:37 a.m. ET (1337 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 79.3 points, or 0.43 percent, at 18,228.85. The S&P 500 was down 7.33 points, or 0.34 percent, at 2,160.94 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 8.31 points, or 0.16 percent, at 5,303.69. Tesla shares rose 2.3 percent to $208.82 after the electric carmaker said third-quarter deliveries rose by 70 percent to 24,500 cars. Janus Capital soared 17 percent after the asset manager said it had agreed to an all-share $6 billion merger with London-listed rival Henderson Global. Cabela's surged 14.5 percent to $62.90 after the company said it would be acquired by Bass Pro Shops in a deal valued at about $5.5 billion. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,585 to 1,038. On the Nasdaq, 1,343 issues fell and 936 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed two new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 23 new highs and seven new lows.

October 3 2016 at 11:29am By Saritha Rai AFP Jeff Bezos. File picture: Win McNamee Bengaluru - When Jeff Bezos donned a bandhgala jacket two years ago and posed for photographs in India, he wasn't just promoting Amazon.com’s year-old business in the country. The web retailer's chief executive officer was also putting his reputation on the line to break into the emerging e-commerce market. Now, with 80 million products for sale, 120 000-plus merchants and more than two dozen warehouses, Bezos's protégé Amit Agarwal is aiming to make Amazon the country's top online store by sales ahead of the Diwali shopping season. Known as the “festival of lights”, the run-up to the celebration is India's biggest retail event, when consumers buy everything from clothes and electronics to jewellery and cars. Indians will spend as much as $1.7 billion online during Diwali this year, according to RedSeer Consulting. Flipkart, India's top web retailer, and local rival Snapdeal, are well aware that they're facing a critical test this year amid Amazon's onslaught. All three are flooding newspapers, billboards and TV shows with ads and are offering discounts for Diwali, which now makes up a third of annual e-commerce sales. At stake is the future of India's online shopping market, as well as Amazon's global expansion plans, which had faltered after it failed to conquer China. “This season could decide who'll be the ultimate winner,” said Haresh Chawla, a Mumbai-based partner at private equity firm India Value Fund Advisors and an angel investor. “The loser will get unnerved and the victor can build internal confidence and rally the troops for the bigger game.” Reaching consumers in India has never been easy - just ask Unilever NV or Procter & Gamble, which spent decades making inroads into the market. There are 22 official languages, and consumption habits differ from place to place. On top of that, there are supply chain inefficiencies, high real estate costs, lack of skilled workers, along with poor infrastructure and labyrinthine regulations. Even so, the prospect of becoming the main web store in a country of 1.25 billion people who are just learning how to shop online is tantalising. RedSeer Consultancy estimates that annual online sales will be $80 billion to $100 billion by 2020 from the current estimate of about $13 billion. “Barely 2 percent of the population shops online,” said Mrigank Gutgutia, who covers consumer internet trends at the Bangalore-based researcher. “It is still only the tip of the India e-commerce iceberg.” Merrill Lynch estimates that Amazon may sell as much as $81 billion in merchandise by 2025, up from $3.7 billion last year. Becoming India's top web retailer would be a vindication for Amazon. In China, the only other market with more than a billion people, the company has little to show after a dozen years, thanks to the dominance of Alibaba Group Holding and other local web retailers. “The biggest opportunity and the biggest challenges are both in India,” said Agarwal, chief of Amazon India. “It's going to be a great Diwali.” After graduating from Stanford University, the 42-year-old spent part of his career at Amazon's Seattle headquarters as Bezos's technical shadow, a coveted position at the company that grooms future leaders by giving them a front-row view of how the business is run. To expand inventory, Amazon has been recruiting sellers at breakneck speed. The web retailer has deployed an army of white-and-orange Chai Carts with emissaries who teach sellers how to list inventory and handle returns over cups of milky chai tea. Another service, called Feet-on-Street, sends people on motorbikes to help merchants photograph and market their wares. Another big task will be moving beyond India's eight big urban areas and into smaller towns and cities. “There could be a protest on the streets, potholes on the road, labor challenges, warehouses in different regions with varied rules, goods trucks passing through state checkpoints - and after all this, the package still has to arrive at the customers’ doorstep overnight if not within hours,” Agarwal said. One key goal for Amazon - its tagline for Diwali is tyohar bade dilwala (the festival with a big heart) - is to lure dormant shoppers and first-time buyers. There are important trends working in Amazon's favour. Exploding smartphone use offers the promise of bringing online commerce to hundreds of millions of buyers and sellers. All of these efforts in India cost money; in June, Amazon said it will invest an additional $3 billion in India on top of an already allocated $2 billion. “An open funding tap could help Amazon offer discounts and bleed out some of its rivals,” said RedSeer's Gutgutia. For Flipkart and Snapdeal, the upcoming Diwali season will determine their ability to stay in the game. For smaller e-commerce startups, survival is at stake. Many, like AskmeBazaar - which advertised aggressively during Diwali last year - shut down before they could make it to this one. Flipkart, the current market leader with more than 100 million registered users, is getting ready. Amazon's top rival in India is in advanced discussions with Wal-Mart Stores to sell a minority stake to the US retailer for as much as $1 billion. The Indian web retailer is adding 10 000 temp workers to handle last-mile logistics, and is offering financing plans to put expensive purchases within customers' reach. Flipkart's tagline this year is ab itne me itnaaa milega: now you'll get so much for so little. Delhi-based Snapdeal, whose backers include Alibaba and Softbank Group, re-branded itself ahead of the shopping season, with a red box logo (its pitch: unbox zindagi, or unbox life). Consumers like Nivedita Raju, are already noticing the difference. The Bangalore-based government official, who buys DVDs, herbs and knickknacks online, said that when she was looking for a computer title that was out-of-stock on Amazon, the web retailer had it printed and dispatched within 10 days. “It’s a very different level of customer service than Indians have been used to,” she said.

News VA chief sees Congress letting politics slow veteran reforms Tom PhilpottContact ReporterMilitary Update Privacy Policy "I was confirmed 97-to-0," says VA Secretary Bob McDonald, recalling the Senate vote in July 2014 on his nomination to lead 360,000 VA employees and an aging infrastructure in delivering health care, disability and education benefits, and a host of other services, to millions of veterans. "And what I sensed was an appetite for, an urging for, somebody with experience transforming large organizations to do that," adds the retired chief executive officer and board chairman of Proctor & Gamble Co. "While I have seen that, I have seen it sporadically. And right now, perhaps because of the elections upcoming, we're seeing a hiatus in that kind of thinking." In an hour-long interview in his office overlooking the White House, McDonald expands on the surprisingly sharp critique of Congress he delivered a week earlier while testifying on recommendations of the congressionally chartered Commission on Care. McDonald is upset to see fiscal 2016 expiring with Congress having failed to pass up to two dozen pieces of legislation he labels "essential" for continuing to transform VA to better serve veterans — with faster access to quality health care outside VA, breaking a disgraceful logjam of disability claim appeals, shelving archaic statutes that handcuff staff, and more. The enthusiasm he felt on Capitol Hill two years ago came amid a patient wait-time scandal that alarmed veterans and demoralized the Veterans Health Administration. It also spurred Congress, nearing a long election-year recess, to swiftly negotiate and pass a flawed Veterans Choice Act, hailed with false promises that would confuse and anger veterans. McDonald, a top industry executive but also a West Point graduate and former Army Ranger, not only was volunteering to clean up a mess but to transform the entire department, its legacy practices and systems, into a high-performance organization that would put customers — veterans — first. The transformation is well underway, McDonald says, but it won't progress at the speed and breadth veterans deserve unless Congress helps. VA needs legislation to streamline and consolidate six separate community-based care programs that VA still must run in addition to the Choice program. It needs authority to repair a broken claims appeal system that has veterans waiting three years for a decision; to lift unnecessary limits on physician work hours; to extend VA authorities to maintain services, such as transportation to facilities in rural areas and for vocational rehabilitation, and to fix provider agreements with long-term care facilities so the hassle of dealing with VA don't keep enticing these facilities to turn out vets. These are highlights of a 100 proposals sent to Congress with the VA budget in February, most of which haven't been voted on by both the House and Senate to become law, McDonald says, despite the continuous pro-veteran rhetoric heard from Republicans holding majorities in both chambers. McDonald notes that in May the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee with bipartisan support cleared an omnibus bill, the Veterans First Act, packed with reforms. Yet no floor vote has been scheduled. A senator or two, it seems, has a hold on the bill, upset over how it would be funded or over how it would keep VA in control of access to non-VA health providers. Despite that disappointment, McDonald suggests he's worked well with the Senate committee and chairman Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.). The House, meanwhile, has passed many separate veteran bills that VA doesn't view as critical. Recently it voted for the appeals process reforms VA wants, but linked it to tougher accountability measure that the administration opposes. The disputed provisions would relax employee job protections so that, at VA alone, staff could be fired or demoted more easily for wrongdoing or poor performance than is possible in other agencies. Many bills get passed "as demonstrations of a particular ideology [without] bipartisan support," says McDonald. "As a result, it's all about legislative jujitsu of can you get the president to agree to something he doesn't want to agree to, by attaching something good to it." McDonald says he realized soon after becoming secretary that veterans' issues, even priority reforms strongly backed by veteran service organizations, are not free these days of the bitter partisanship that has made Congresses increasingly dysfunctional. "I perceived that relatively early on," he says, "particularly when there was this spirit of 'gotcha!' If you say the wrong word, the political opposition tries to exploit it in order to embarrass the administration. It wasn't something I was familiar with in business." His harshest critics are Republicans on the House Veterans Affairs Committee. Its chairman, Rep. Jeff Miller (Fla.), led lengthy investigations into the patient wait-time scandal and launched many other examinations of VA waste, fraud and abuse since taking the committee gavel in 2011. His staff pumps out a steady stream of press releases focusing on VA corruption. Miller says McDonald failed in his promise to establish "a climate of accountability" across VA workforce despite his claims of 3,750 staff firings. McDonald doesn't mention Miller by name for this column, but he's the presumed target of some pointed remarks. "You've got to make a decision in life," the secretary says. "Are you always going to be pointing out problems, which is easy to do, or are you going to be part of the solution? It's a cop-out to be what I call an 'against' leader. You know, 'I can negotiate a better deal' or 'you've improved access [to health care] but not enough.' It's always easy to criticize what someone else has done. But that's not going to improve things for veterans." I asked if, in his opinion, some Republicans don't want this administration to be able to claim more victories on behalf of veterans. McDonald replies, "Maybe that's the issue. Maybe that's the issue." He says he hasn't made that charge to committee leaders. "But one thing I did say is we've got to stop using veterans as political pawns. Veterans are getting very upset about standing behind candidates, being thanked for their service, but then not getting part of the sacred covenant Abraham Lincoln talked about in his Second Inaugural address." If the priority is party politics, McDonald finds irony in the quest, because he was a Republican when nominated, a donor even to prominent GOP candidates from his home state of Ohio, including John Boehner. "Now I say my political party is the Veterans' Party," McDonald says. Send comments to Military Update, P.O.

Saritha Rai @SarithaRai More stories by Saritha Rai October 2, 2016 — 5:00 PM EDT October 2, 2016 — 5:00 PM EDT Amazon to Spend $5 Billion to Dominate India E-Commerce When Jeff Bezos donned a bandhgala jacket two years ago and posed for photographs in India, he wasn't just promoting Amazon.com Inc.'s year-old business in the country. The web retailer's chief executive officer was also putting his reputation on the line to break into the emerging e-commerce market. Jeff Bezos visits Bangalore in September 2014. Photographer: Manjunath Kiran/AFP via Getty Images Now, with 80 million products for sale, 120,000-plus merchants and more than two dozen warehouses, Bezos's protégé Amit Agarwal is aiming to make Amazon the country's top online store by sales ahead of the Diwali shopping season. Known as the "festival of lights," the run-up to the celebration is India's biggest retail event, when consumers buy everything from clothes and electronics to jewelry and cars. Indians will spend as much as $1.7 billion online during Diwali this year, according to RedSeer Consulting. Flipkart Ltd., India's top web retailer, and local rival Snapdeal, are well aware that they're facing a critical test this year amid Amazon's onslaught. All three are flooding newspapers, billboards and TV shows with ads and are offering discounts for Diwali, which now makes up a third of annual e-commerce sales. At stake is the future of India's online shopping market, as well as Amazon's global expansion plans, which had faltered after it failed to conquer China. "This season could decide who'll be the ultimate winner," said Haresh Chawla, a Mumbai-based partner at private equity firm India Value Fund Advisors and an angel investor. "The loser will get unnerved and the victor can build internal confidence and rally the troops for the bigger game." Reaching consumers in India has never been easy—just ask Unilever NV or Procter & Gamble Co., which spent decades making inroads into the market. There are 22 official languages, and consumption habits differ from place to place. On top of that, there are supply chain inefficiencies, high real estate costs, lack of skilled workers, along with poor infrastructure and labyrinthine regulations.  Even so, the prospect of becoming the main web store in a country of 1.25 billion people who are just learning how to shop online is tantalizing. RedSeer Consultancy Pvt. estimates that annual online sales will be $80 billion to $100 billion by 2020 from the current estimate of about $13 billion. "Barely 2 percent of the population shops online," said Mrigank Gutgutia, who covers consumer internet trends at the Bangalore-based researcher. "It is still only the tip of the India e-commerce iceberg." Merrill Lynch estimates that Amazon may sell as much as $81 billion in merchandise by 2025, up from $3.7 billion last year. Becoming India's top web retailer would be a vindication for Amazon. In China, the only other market with more than a billion people, the company has little to show after a dozen years, thanks to the dominance of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and other local web retailers. "The biggest opportunity and the biggest challenges are both in India," said Agarwal, chief of Amazon India. "It's going to be a great Diwali." Amit Agarwal.  Photographer: Namas Bhojani/Bloomberg After graduating from Stanford University, the 42-year-old spent part of his career at Amazon's Seattle headquarters as Bezos's technical shadow, a coveted position at the company that grooms future leaders by giving them a front-row view of how the business is run. To expand inventory, Amazon has been recruiting sellers at breakneck speed. The web retailer has deployed an army of white-and-orange Chai Carts with emissaries who teach sellers how to list inventory and handle returns over cups of milky chai tea. Another service, called Feet-on-Street, sends people on motorbikes to help merchants photograph and market their wares. Another big task will be moving beyond India's eight big urban areas and into smaller towns and cities. "There could be a protest on the streets, potholes on the road, labor challenges, warehouses in different regions with varied rules, goods trucks passing through state checkpoints—and after all this, the package still has to arrive at the customers’ doorstep overnight if not within hours," Agarwal said. One key goal for Amazon—its tagline for Diwali is tyohar bade dilwala (the festival with a big heart)—is to lure dormant shoppers and first-time buyers. There are important trends working in Amazon's favor. Exploding smartphone use offers the promise of bringing online commerce to hundreds of millions of buyers and sellers. An Amazon pick up point in New Delhi. Photographer: Mint/Hindustan Times via Getty Images All of these efforts in India cost money; in June, Amazon said it will invest an additional $3 billion in India on top of an already allocated $2 billion. "An open funding tap could help Amazon offer discounts and bleed out some of its rivals," said RedSeer's Gutgutia. For Flipkart and Snapdeal, the upcoming Diwali season will determine their ability to stay in the game. For smaller e-commerce startups, survival is at stake. Many, like AskmeBazaar—which advertised aggressively during Diwali last year—shut down before they could make it to this one.

Amazon's top rival in India is in advanced discussions with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to sell a minority stake to the U.S. retailer for as much as $1 billion. The Indian web retailer is adding 10,000 temp workers to handle last-mile logistics, and is offering financing plans to put expensive purchases within customers' reach. Flipkart's tagline this year is ab itne me itnaaa milega: now you'll get so much for so little. Delhi-based Snapdeal, whose backers include Alibaba and Softbank Group Corp., re-branded itself ahead of the shopping season, with a red box logo (its pitch: unbox zindagi, or unbox life).  Consumers like Nivedita Raju, are already noticing the difference. The Bangalore-based government official, who buys DVDs, herbs and knickknacks online, said that when she was looking for a computer title that was out-of-stock on Amazon, the web retailer had it printed and dispatched within 10 days. "It’s a very different level of customer service than Indians have been used to," she said. A shopper carries boxes of toys on his head in Mumbai two days before Diwali.

She recently earned the National Outstanding DAR Service for Veterans Award, the highest veterans service award the group bestows. Kathleen M. Zinskie found a way to combine her love of history and heritage with her longing to serve. A member of the Pennsylvania State Society Daughters of the American Revolution over the past seven years, Mrs. Zinskie dedicates her life to give back to those who served. “I got into (PSSDAR) for the history, but I stayed for the service,” the Olyphant resident said on a recent afternoon. “We do so much.” As the group’s chairwoman, Mrs. Zinskie, works with veterans’ hospitals and homes around the state to improve the quality of life for the facilities’ inhabitants. She also developed a project to dedicate local Revolutionary War soldiers’ graves and collaborated with a local sewing and crocheting group to donate lap blankets to local veterans’ establishments, among other outreach programs for those who served. In June, Mrs. Zinskie earned the highest veterans service award PSSDAR bestows: the National Outstanding DAR Service for Veterans Award. “I started out by going down to Gino (J.) Merli (Veterans’ Center) and saying, ‘What do you need?’” Mrs. Zinskie said. “From there, I learned what the wants were and met the residents. I wanted to help any way I could.” Between 2014 and 2015, Mrs. Zinskie oragnized efforts to deliver 300 comfort bags to women veterans at six veterans’ homes and eight veterans’ hospitals throughout the state. The bags contained note cards, novels, pens, nail files, combs and brushes. A donation from Proctor & Gamble also secured toilet paper, paper towels, napkins, shampoo, conditioner, feminine hygiene products, air fresheners and other body and home products the facilities needed. Her fellow members helped her in each part of the project, from coordinating donations to storing products, sometimes in her Olyphant home, to hand-delivering the bags to the veterans. The veterans’ deep appreciation and gratitude overwhelms Mrs. Zinskie the most. While she delivered some comfort bags, she met a woman who worked as a clerk in New Jersey during World War II that left Mrs. Zinskie with a lasting impression about the importance of giving back to veterans. “(The woman) was upset, and she said, ‘I wish I was born a man, because I could have made a difference,’” Mrs. Zinskie recalled. “(Women veterans) don’t believe they deserve to be called ‘veterans.’ I will never forget her saying that to me. “Everybody played a part. I think of it like the Butterfly Effect: take her out of the equation, and something else may have happened. She did make a difference.” Mrs. Zinskie champions for recognition for those who served, and that, combined with her lifelong love of history, sparked her interest in joining the DAR. She always held a deep interest in the past, often visiting historical places and landmarks instead of amusement parks and beaches with her husband, Harry, and their three children, Christina, Jessica and Nick. “My daughter was in school, and the teacher asked the class to raise their hand if they went to this monument or this historic site, and my daughter put her hand up for almost all of them,” Mrs. Zinskie said, laughing. “I can’t help it. I just love, love history.” Mrs. Zinskie’s interest in the past prompted her to find out more about her ancestors. In her research, she found lots of information about her family’s origins, but, most importantly, she realized people during those times didn’t have to serve in battle to be a part of the American Revolution. “Anyone who paid taxes or owned property, they contributed,” said Mrs. Zinskie, who confirmed 15 patriots in her bloodline through ancestry research. “You didn’t necessarily have to have fought. There were lots of people who were donating and supporting the cause to start the country.” Mrs. Zinskie always has volunteering on her mind. Even leisurely activities, like cross-stitch, become a vehicle for her to help others. Mrs. Zinskie auctions off the pieces she makes at DAR events and donates all of the proceeds to her cause. She cross-stitched all 300 bags she donated during the comfort project. Mrs. Zinskie insists she couldn’t go through with service projects or give back like she has without the help of her fellow DAR members. She said she is fortunate enough to work part-time with her husband so she can dedicate time to service projects if her fellow members can’t. “I can pick up for the time constraints, and someone would do it for me if I couldn’t,” she said. “We’re all women, and we all have a common goal: we want to serve.” Contact the writer: gmazur@timesshamrock.com, @gmazurTT on Twitter.

Sections Deseret NewsOpinion Opinion Mel S. Lavitt: Facebook deal a lost opportunity for the state and local communities By Mel S. Lavitt For the Deseret News Published: Oct. 2, 2016 12:10 a.m. Updated: Oct. 1, 2016 7:52 p.m. 4 Comments One thing that makes Utah great is our win-win attitude and sincere desire to find common ground on challenging issues. Because of this, Utahns solve problems few other states can. From taking a compassionate approach to immigration to forging an elegant solution balancing LGBTQ rights and religious freedom, we have continually demonstrated our ability to engage in civil discourse on divisive issues and emerge with policies that unify. Utah is unique and successful because we collaborate to find solutions. However, sometimes despite our efforts, differences are unable to be reconciled. The recruitment of Facebook to the state is a recent example. It is my hope that its failure is merely the exception to Utah’s reigning rule of partnership. I was born and raised in Denver and spent most of my career in investment banking in New York City and San Francisco. My family and I first came here in 1976 to ski and, like so many other transplants, ended up adopting Utah as our home. I currently serve as chairman of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development (GOED) Board. This position has provided a great opportunity to champion Utah as a wonderful place to live, work and raise a family. I have watched the state facilitate effective processes that bring companies and communities together to create win-win opportunities for economic prosperity. There are too many economic successes to name them all, but to mention a few: Box Elder County being selected in 2007 as the home of Procter and Gamble’s first new expansion plant in the United States in decades, aerospace manufacturer Syberjet expanding in Cedar City, and the well-known success story of Goldman Sachs in Salt Lake City. While these projects are in various corners of the state and represent different industries, there’s one thing they have in common: the companies have flourished in Utah because of strong collaboration among the state, local governments, companies and communities that host them. As it has in the past with other large capital expenditure projects, GOED played a role in trying to attract Facebook to the state. We did so because we have seen firsthand the follow-on investment and job creation that can occur when an enterprise data center locates here. This approach paid significant dividends in past projects. For example, Oracle and eBay both solidified their relationships with the state through early data center investments. Those relationships later led to large-scale employment centers and economic development in surrounding communities. We hoped we could replicate that model with Facebook. When it became apparent there was discord between the city and county over the local incentive deal terms, terms that were being negotiated independent of state involvement, we brought both parties to the table to attempt to find a win-win solution for the project. We believed we were making progress with Salt Lake County and West Jordan City, and were disappointed when Salt Lake County and West Jordan City could not find a way to narrow the gap between their respective viewpoints. Also, the back and forth that found its way into the press unnecessarily politicized the situation and complicated further negotiations with the company. This negativity impeded our efforts to seek a compromise and eroded the company’s confidence in the state and in our local governments. So instead of a win-win, we have ended up with a lose-lose all around. The Facebook negotiation was the first breakdown of this kind that I have witnessed, and I see it as a lost opportunity for the state and our local communities. It could also have a negative effect on future recruitments. Now that the dust has settled, where do we go from here? Our process of collaborating to find constructive solutions has worked in the past. And with a few tweaks, GOED believes it will work in the future. We will help local communities define, refine, and execute on their economic development goals, and ensure there is more transparency with the public. We will work to ensure local governments and the state are better harmonized in our joint recruitment efforts. We will work with our legislative colleagues to ensure local incentives are more appropriately aligned with state incentives, which are always post-performance, and that incentives in all forms respect the Utah taxpayer. We will seek out opportunities and projects that provide a strategic benefit to the state, and hope we can empower our local communities to better partner and communicate so good projects end in good deals. That is the Utah way. Bottom line: Utah is still No. 1 in my book, and with all of us working together it will remain so in the future. Mel S. Lavitt is board chairman of the Utah Governor’s Office of Economic Development. 4 Comments Like that? Read this.

Major indexes have bounced between gains and losses in the past few days, with investors nervous about the outcome of a tight race for the White House ahead of the Nov. 8 election. Big banks extended recent declines as investors worried about the stability of Deutsche Bank and also Wells Fargo & Co's handling of sales abuses. U.S-listed shares of Deutsche slipped 0.85 percent as hopes faded of a swift deal with U.S. authorities over a multi-billion dollar penalty for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities.

About 5.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, well below the 7.1 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data. S&P 500 companies on average are expected to posts a 0.5 percent dip in third-quarter earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data. That would mark a fifth straight quarter of year-over-year earnings declines, in large part due to weak oil prices. Tesla Motors jumped 4.74 percent after the electric carmaker said third-quarter deliveries rose by 70 percent to 24,500 cars. Cabela's surged 15.02 percent after the retailer said it would be acquired by Bass Pro Shops in a deal valued at about $5.5 billion.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: The fourth quarter got off to a weak start for U.S. stock investors on Monday, with financials, consumer staples and utilities pulling the S&P 500 lower. Major indexes have bounced between gains and losses in the past few days, with investors nervous about the outcome of a tight race for the White House ahead of the Nov. 8 election. Big banks extended recent declines as investors worried about the stability of Deutsche Bank and also Wells Fargo & Co's handling of sales abuses. U.S-listed shares of Deutsche slipped 0.85 percent as hopes faded of a swift deal with U.S. authorities over a multi-billion dollar penalty for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities. "The feeling is there will be a negotiation lowering that penalty but it's certainly a bit of an overhang on the overall market," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. The S&P 500 financial index declined 0.43 percent as Wells Fargo slid 1.02 percent to its lowest since December 2013. Also weighing on investor sentiment was a plan announced by Britain on Sunday to start its separation from the European Union by March. With yields on U.S. Treasury bonds up following stronger-than-expected U.S. manufacturing data for September, the interest-rate sensitive utility sector fell 1.35 percent. The consumer staples index declined 0.6 percent, with Procter & Gamble falling 1.21 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.3 percent to end the session at 18,253.85 points and the S&P 500 lost 0.33 percent to 2,161.2. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.21 percent to 5,300.87 points. About 5.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, well below the 7.1 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data. S&P 500 companies on average are expected to posts a 0.5 percent dip in third-quarter earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data. That would mark a fifth straight quarter of year-over-year earnings declines, in large part due to weak oil prices. Tesla Motors jumped 4.74 percent after the electric carmaker said third-quarter deliveries rose by 70 percent to 24,500 cars. Cabela's surged 15.02 percent after the retailer said it would be acquired by Bass Pro Shops in a deal valued at about US$5.5 billion. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.40-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.40-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 77 new highs and 32 new lows.

In a 15-second spot, Burgess scoots into the scene to tell a woman doing laundry to “Unstop right there.” He explains that he’s about to “pop a cap of mmm-fresh in that washer” which will provide a fresh scent which lasts up to 12 weeks. That feels almost as long as unskippable online spots, he adds, with a knowing look at the camera. While the brief spot is unable to live up to the actor’s comedic potential, it still provides more entertainment value than you’d expect from the category. There’s also a full-length version which stretches on for over a minute. If there’s a looseness to the extended version, that’s because Grey New York and Downy let Burgess improvise some of his lines, including an unexpected Shakespeare reference. Just don’t ask him to fold clothes. “Tituss was free to add a lot of his own improvisations to the work, Grey associate creative director Katie Jensen explained to Adweek. “He added the entire section of what we’ll call ‘Downy Hamlet.'” Credits: Advertiser: P&G/Unstopables Agency: Grey New York Chief Creative Officer, Grey New York: Andreas Dahlqvist Executive Creative Director, Grey New York: Lisa Topol Executive Creative Director, Grey New York: Derek Barnes ACD/Art Director, Grey New York: Katie Jensen ACD/Copywriter, Grey New York: Ani Munoz Strategy Director, Grey New York: Justine Feron Strategist, Grey New York: Toni Dawkins EVP/Global Account Director, Grey New York: Caroline Winterton SVP/Global Account Director, Grey New York: Stephanie O’Donnell VP/Account Director, Grey New York: Kelly Norris Account Executive, Grey New York: David Slifer Assistant Account Executive, Grey New York, Alana Goldstein Production Company: Townhouse Townhouse President: Bennett McCarroll Townhouse Head of Integrated Production: James McPherson Townhouse Exec.

Reuters Published Monday, Oct. 03, 2016 4:20PM EDT Last updated Monday, Oct. 03, 2016 5:18PM EDT Comments AA Canada’s main stock index fell on Monday, as major gold miners lost ground and heavyweight banks also pulled back as the federal government tightened mortgage and tax rules in a bid to cool the housing market. The most influential stocks weighing on the index included Goldcorp Inc which fell 4.5 per cent to C$20.68 after it temporarily shut down its Peñasquito gold mine in Mexico due to a week-long blockade by a trucking contractor. Barrick Gold Corp, which is dealing with its own forced shutdown of operations at a mine in Argentina, lost 1.9 per cent to C$22.78. The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, lost 1.8 per cent. “Apart from the trials and tribulations of the giant gold companies which are mostly Canadian, the mining companies are experiencing a growing arrival of free cash flows,” said Michael Smedley, chief portfolio manager at Morgan Meighen & Associates. The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index closed down 36.82 points, or 0.25 per cent, at 14,689.04. Seven of the index’s 10 main groups ended in negative territory. The financials group slipped 0.2 per cent, as Ottawa said it will close a tax loophole and introduce a stress test to insured mortgage lending. Investors were also more cautious as Britain set a March deadline to start its withdrawal from the European Union and worries over Deutsche Bank continued to swirl. Royal Bank of Canada fell 0.4 per cent to C$80.95 and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce lost 0.7 per cent to C$101.01. Shares in fashion retailer Aritzia Inc settled at C$17.71 in their market debut, after they were priced at C$16 last week. The energy sector gained 0.6 per cent as Brent settled above $50 a barrel for the first time since August and U.S. crude hit three-month highs, after Iran exhorted the need for other oil producers to join OPEC in supporting the market. Shares in Spectral Medical Inc slumped 85 per cent to 24 Canadian cents after it said its experimental treatment for sepsis – a common, often deadly complication of infection – failed a late-stage study, stymieing the company’s plans to bring to market the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved device for the condition. Wall St dips in slow start to fourth quarter The fourth quarter got off to a weak start for U.S. stock investors on Monday, with financials, consumer staples and utilities pulling the S&P 500 lower. Major indexes have bounced between gains and losses in the past few days, with investors nervous about the outcome of a tight race for the White House ahead of the Nov. 8 election. Big banks extended recent declines as investors worried about the stability of Deutsche Bank and also Wells Fargo & Co’s handling of sales abuses. U.S-listed shares of Deutsche slipped 0.85 per cent as hopes faded of a swift deal with U.S. authorities over a multi-billion dollar penalty for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities. “The feeling is there will be a negotiation lowering that penalty but it’s certainly a bit of an overhang on the overall market,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. The S&P 500 financial index declined 0.43 per cent as Wells Fargo slid 1.02 per cent to its lowest since December 2013. Also weighing on investor sentiment was a plan announced by Britain on Sunday to start its separation from the European Union by March. With yields on U.S. Treasury bonds up following stronger-than-expected U.S. manufacturing data for September, the interest-rate sensitive utility sector fell 1.35 per cent. The consumer staples index declined 0.6 per cent, with Procter & Gamble falling 1.21 per cent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.3 per cent to end the session at 18,253.85 points and the S&P 500 lost 0.33 per cent to 2,161.2. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.21 per cent to 5,300.87 points. About 5.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, well below the 7.1 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data. S&P 500 companies on average are expected to posts a 0.5 per cent dip in third-quarter earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data. That would mark a fifth straight quarter of year-over-year earnings declines, in large part due to weak oil prices. Tesla Motors jumped 4.74 per cent after the electric carmaker said third-quarter deliveries rose by 70 per cent to 24,500 cars. Cabela’s surged 15.02 per cent after the retailer said it would be acquired by Bass Pro Shops in a deal valued at about $5.5-billion. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.40-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.40-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 77 new highs and 32 new lows.

She will become chief creative officer at the latter agency as of December 1. In a statement, Mother founding partner and creative chairman Paul Malmstrom said: “We feel Corinna belongs here at Mother. She has a magical mix of talent, ambition, and soulfulness With her, we’ll continue to bring even greater expressions of creativity to our clients.” CEO Peter Ravailhe added: “With her relentless pursuit of excellence, in craft and creativity, Corinna will add incredible value to the brands we love to work with, and to Mother as a whole.” An Ogilvy representative declined to comment on Falusi’s departure, but a source close to the agency told us it has begun seeking her successor and that it will search both internally and externally for its next creative leader. Prior to today’s announcement, Mother New York hired three new creatives to work across its client roster with a focus on the Target and Stella Artois accounts. Falusi started her agency career at her native Germany’s Jung Von Matt before moving to StrawberryFrog, where she spent nearly a decade in Amsterdam and New York and worked on accounts ranging from P&G to Frito Lay. She joined Ogilvy in 2012, and last January the WPP shop promoted her to replace former CCO Calle Sjoenell, who left two summers ago to run Lowe Brindfors in Sweden. While serving as chief creative officer over the past year-plus, Falusi continued to run the Coca-Cola and IKEA accounts while also “driv[ing] the creative vision of the New York agency.” The release does not elaborate on specific reasons for her departure, but we did acquire the internal email announcement that went out to all New York Ogilvy staff on Friday via North American CCO Steve Simpson and New York CEO Lou Aversano. It reads: CORINNA FALUSI Four years ago, Corinna Falusi joined Ogilvy. From her very first day, Corinna began to pour all of her passion and energy into the work and into her relationships with all of us. And she continued to do this every day, without fail. Today, one thousand six hundred and fourteen days later, we regret to announce that Corinna has decided to leave us to take on new and different challenges. We can feel sad about this—nobody who worked with her can help it—but the most important thing to do is thank her: for her work, her mentorship and her partnership, which she gave to us fully for over four years, every single day. We will miss Corinna’s special spirit and point of view, but we are lucky to have incredible and passionate creative leaders. Kristy, Alfonso, and Teddy will be gathering the creative department together to discuss our path forward.

Ogg October 3, 2016 10:50 am EST Print Email Tweet It is no secret at all that investors love dividends. Companies raising dividends continuously are even more sought after than those just paying the same old dividend year in and year out. It is frequently mentioned that roughly half of all total returns through time come from dividends. As the third quarter has given way to the fourth quarter of 2016, the reality is that this bull market is seven and a half years old. Valuations are relatively high in the broad market, and there is growing evidence that some companies may not be able to keep raising dividends endlessly. In an effort to make sure investors do not go after the wrong dividend-paying companies, 24/7 Wall St. has reviewed many dividends. We have found seven Dow Jones Industrial Average companies and identified 14 S&P 500 companies that have raised dividends for 25 years or more that can likely keep raising their dividends. After looking at the big picture, there are actually four Dow member companies that have increased their dividends for 50 consecutive years. Being a Dividend Aristocrat means that a company has hiked dividends for 25 years straight. Perhaps companies that have hiked their dividend for 50 years or more should be called the Dividend Deities. Here are four Dow stocks that have raised their dividends for 50 years or more, and that also appear to be able to keep raising their dividends in the years ahead. 3M Co. (NYSE: MMM) has a lot more going for it than the Post-It note, and it has raised dividends for roughly two decades longer than it has been selling the Post-It note. The conglomerate has a dividend yield of about 2.5%, but its 99-straight-year dividend history has seen an increase to annual dividend for 57 consecutive years. Despite years of hiking, 3M only recently has become more aggressive on dividends. To prove the point, 19 of the 30 Dow stocks outyield the conglomerate. Shares of 3M last closed at $175.33, with a consensus analyst price target of $181.73 and a 52-week trading range of $134.64 to $182.27. The company has a total market cap of $106 billion. For some time Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO) has been diversifying away from sugary drinks, and that goes far beyond diet sodas with artificial sweeteners. It has large water operations, as well as sports and specialty beverages, now. The beverage giant yields 3.3% and it has paid a dividend for longer than most of us have lived. Its consecutive time frame is 54 years with dividend hikes — with plenty of room for hikes ahead. Coca-Cola also pays the eighth highest yields of the 30 Dow stocks. Its shares recently closed at $42.31. The consensus price target is $47.17, and the 52-week range is $40.43 to $47.13. Coca-Cola’s market cap is $181 billion. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) is sort of like Old Faithful in that it just keeps spewing money into the air for investors each year. Perhaps there is something to be said for sticking with a mantra of being in health care products and pharmaceuticals and in consumer products at the same time. The yield is now 2.7%. The company has a 54 consecutive years of hikes, but its position among the 30 Dow dividends is just number 17. Johnson & Johnson shares last closed at $118.00, within a 52-week range of $92.58 to $126.07. The consensus price target is $126.61. The market cap is $322 billion. Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) may have been restructuring its consumer products portfolio for a while (just finalized a Coty deal), but it has so far never buckled under the competitive and ever-changing landscape of retail. It has paid a dividend for 126 consecutive years now, but 2016 marked the 60th consecutive year that it has increased that dividend. The current yield is 3.0%m which ranks as the 12th highest dividend of the 30 Dow stocks. Shares of Procter & Gamble recently closed at $89.37, in a 52-week range of $72.50 to $90.22. The market cap is $237 billion. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   While other dividend aristocrats might or might not be able to pay ever higher dividends year in and year out, there are many other companies close behind these four Dow stocks. Some of these other soon-to-be Dividend Deities are not Dow stocks but the likes of Target, PepsiCo, Sysco Foods, Kimberly-Clark, Consolidated Edison, Becton Dickinson, and ADP — as well as Dow component McDonald’s. They have all paid out higher and higher dividends for 40 consecutive years or more. By Jon C.

"I think the market is still looking for inspiration. Non of the news we've gotten have been terribly encouraging," said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank. "Some sort of corrective action, given the [high] valuations wouldn't be surprising and would be healthy for the market." The Dow Jones industrial average fell 104.40 points at session lows before closing about 55 points lower, with Travelers Companies and UnitedHealth Group contributing the most losses. "The auto sales data were not great," said Chuck Self, CIO at iSectors. "The manufacturing data were not great, either. They're higher, but not running away. I think a lot of this has to do with rally we had Friday." The S&P 500 fell 0.3 percent, with real estate falling 1.8 percent to lead decliners. "Things seem to be quiet at the moment. October is usually a rough month for stocks. i guess we're getting a bit of a kickback from Friday, said Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial Service. The Nasdaq composite slid 0.21 percent. "For me, it could be the return of overbought conditions on Friday. We had a pretty strong session on Friday and that supports a pullback today," said Katie Stockton, chief technical strategist at BTIG. She added, however, that overall short-term momentum remains strong, and that the S&P could break above its all-time intraday high of 2,193.81. "It's a minor level because it hasn't been tested that much. Technical levels are stronger the more you test them," Stockton said. Stocks ended the third quarter on a high note on Friday, rising around 1 percent. Getty Images Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. In economic news, the September Markit Manufacturing PMI came in at 51.5, a three-month low. "U.S. manufacturers signalled another moderate upturn in both production volumes and incoming new work during September, but the latest survey indicated a further loss of growth momentum from July's recent peak," Markit said. The ISM Manufacturing index for September came in at 51.5, up from 49.4 in the previous month. Construction spending fell 0.7 percent in August, with analysts expecting a 0.2 percent increase. "The market, I think, is becoming more accepting of the fact that [Federal Reserve Chair] Janet Yellen wants to raise interest rates in December," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. "But you need the market to be underpinned by growth." "The ISM number came above consensus, and that's positive," she said. Also, Nissan reported its U.S. auto sales rose 4.9 percent in September, beating expectations. Ford reported a sales fall of 8 percent, still better than the expected 8.5 percent. Toyota sales, meanwhile, missed estimates, rising 1.5 percent. General Motors sales fell 0.6 percent, less than expected. Other vehicle sales for September will be released throughout the day. Crude prices rose broadly, with U.S. oil futures settling 1.2 percent higher at $48.81 per barrel, supported by a planned production cut by exporter group OPEC, although analysts cautioned a stubborn supply overhang could temper a longer-lasting rally. Brent prices broke above $50, hitting their highest level since August. The OPEC deal is expected to take effect in November. "If we get a production cut, even if it's small, or even a production freeze, that's the best news we've gotten over the past two years," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. Overseas, European stocks closed mostly flat as investors kept an eye on Deutsche Bank and the U.K. process to leave the European Union. On Friday, U.S. equities had closed sharply higher amid a report that Deutsche Bank was near a settlement with the Justice Department. However, U.S.-listed shares traded 1.9 percent lower Monday with no official deal being announced between Deutsche Bank and the DOJ. British Prime Minister Theresa May said Sunday she'd start the Brexit process in the early part of 2017, a process which is expected to take about two years to complete. The British pound fell about 1 percent against the dollar on Monday, trading at $1.285. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar rose 0.24 percent, with the euro near $1.121 and the yen around 101.61. U.S. Treasurys were mostly lower, with the two-year note yield at 0.794 percent and the benchmark 10-year note yield around 1.6187 percent.

Allied Market Research Logo     Facebook Twitter Pinterest Allied Market Research Logo PORTLAND, Oregon, October 3, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- A new report published by Allied Market Research, titled, "Personal Care Electrical Appliances Market: Global Opportunity Analysis and Industry Forecast, 2014-2022", projects that the world personal care electrical appliances market is expected to reach $28,007 million by 2022. The hair care appliances segment is estimated to dominate this market throughout 2016 - 2022. North America accounted for around two-fifths share of the market in 2015.      (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20140911/647229 ) Summary Personal Care Electrical Appliances Market can be accessed on the website at https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/personal-care-electrical-appliances-market   Growth in ageing population, improving economic conditions, increasing awareness regarding personal grooming, inclination towards automation, and growing online sales are factors that drive the market growth. In addition, growing urban population and increasing demand from untapped markets such as Asia-Pacific and LAMEA are anticipated to further drive the demand for the personal care electrical appliances market. However, lack of durability and high cost of the products limit the market growth. The hair care appliances segment accounted for over two-fifths of the global personal care electrical appliances market in 2015, owing to the influence of western lifestyle on the population of developing and untapped regions. The hair straightener sub-segment was the leading revenue contributor to the global hair care appliances market in 2014, accounting for more than 43% share, and is further expected to dominate the market throughout the forecast period, growing at a CAGR of 7.1% from 2016 to 2022. The hair stylers segment is the fastest growing market, registering a CAGR of 10.0% from 2016 to 2022. This is attributed to growing inclination of women towards styled hair rather than straightening. Trimmer was the leading revenue contributor to the global hair removal appliances segment owing to its established market status and historical trend of trimmed beard. Epilators and shavers together contributed around 47% share in 2014 and would grow at a CAGR of 10.2% and 10.8% respectively during the forecast period. Epilators have a different mode of action as that of shavers. They do not remove the hair from surface, rather pluck off hair strands from their roots. This gives a permanent solution as compared to shaving. Therefore, men use shavers for facial hair, whereas women prefer epilators. The availability of substitute products, such as hair removal creams, and others act as replacements for epilators; thereby, limiting their growth. Consumers shift from creams and other hair removal methods to epilators is expected to be gradual in untapped markets of the Asia-Pacific and LAMEA regions. Electric toothbrush is the primary product under the oral care appliance segment that dominates the market. Plaque removers are electric toothbrushes with a rotatory brush head especially made to remove plaque. Plaque removers have gained importance among people with periodontal issues, while the device is not common among buyers. In 2014, powered toothbrush was the leading revenue generator in the oral care segment, and is projected to dominate the market throughout the analysis period. Personal care electrical appliances are used by both men and women. Female buyers have a higher share in hair care products, whereas males dominate the shavers market. The female customers segment is expected to outpace the male customers segment in the near future. However, the male customers segment would generate a notable revenue by 2022 growing at a CAGR of 8.6% during the forecast period. According to Deepankar Bose, Research Manager, Consumer Goods at AMR, "The world personal care electrical appliances market is anticipated to witness steady demand in developed regions on account of early adoption of premium lifestyle and awareness regarding personal grooming. However, individuals in developing regions are inclined towards hair care technology such as stylers and straighteners, which would further fuel the demand." The small domestic equipment market is the parent market for personal care electrical appliances, and the prevailing trend in this business area has a similar impact on the personal care market. The global market for personal care electrical personal care appliances has witnessed steady growth, and is expected to maintain this trend throughout the forecast period. The Asia-Pacific, Middle East, and Africa are expected to exhibit incremental growth during the forecast period due to growing awareness and rising disposable income. Brazil, Russia, India, and China (BRIC) are the countries with the highest growth potential during the forecast period. As per the present market scenario, North America generated the highest revenue in 2014, accounting for around two-fifths of the market value, and is expected to dominate the market throughout the analysis period.

The hair care appliances segment is estimated to dominate this market throughout 2016 - 2022. North America accounted for around two-fifths share of the market in 2015.      (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20140911/647229 ) Summary Personal Care Electrical Appliances Market can be accessed on the website at https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/personal-care-ele c trical-appliances-market   Growth in ageing population, improving economic conditions, increasing awareness regarding personal grooming, inclination towards automation, and growing online sales are factors that drive the market growth. In addition, growing urban population and increasing demand from untapped markets such as Asia-Pacific and LAMEA are anticipated to further drive the demand for the personal care electrical appliances market. However, lack of durability and high cost of the products limit the market growth. The hair care appliances segment accounted for over two-fifths of the global personal care electrical appliances market in 2015, owing to the influence of western lifestyle on the population of developing and untapped regions. The hair straightener sub-segment was the leading revenue contributor to the global hair care appliances market in 2014, accounting for more than 43% share, and is further expected to dominate the market throughout the forecast period, growing at a CAGR of 7.1% from 2016 to 2022. The hair stylers segment is the fastest growing market, registering a CAGR of 10.0% from 2016 to 2022. This is attributed to growing inclination of women towards styled hair rather than straightening. Trimmer was the leading revenue contributor to the global hair removal appliances segment owing to its established market status and historical trend of trimmed beard. Epilators and shavers together contributed around 47% share in 2014 and would grow at a CAGR of 10.2% and 10.8% respectively during the forecast period. Epilators have a different mode of action as that of shavers. They do not remove the hair from surface, rather pluck off hair strands from their roots. This gives a permanent solution as compared to shaving. Therefore, men use shavers for facial hair, whereas women prefer epilators. The availability of substitute products, such as hair removal creams, and others act as replacements for epilators; thereby, limiting their growth. Consumers shift from creams and other hair removal methods to epilators is expected to be gradual in untapped markets of the Asia-Pacific and LAMEA regions. Electric toothbrush is the primary product under the oral care appliance segment that dominates the market. Plaque removers are electric toothbrushes with a rotatory brush head especially made to remove plaque. Plaque removers have gained importance among people with periodontal issues, while the device is not common among buyers. In 2014, powered toothbrush was the leading revenue generator in the oral care segment, and is projected to dominate the market throughout the analysis period. Personal care electrical appliances are used by both men and women. Female buyers have a higher share in hair care products, whereas males dominate the shavers market. The female customers segment is expected to outpace the male customers segment in the near future. However, the male customers segment would generate a notable revenue by 2022 growing at a CAGR of 8.6% during the forecast period. According to Deepankar Bose, Research Manager, Consumer Goods at AMR, "The world personal care electrical appliances market is anticipated to witness steady demand in developed regions on account of early adoption of premium lifestyle and awareness regarding personal grooming. However, individuals in developing regions are inclined towards hair care technology such as stylers and straighteners, which would further fuel the demand." The small domestic equipment market is the parent market for personal care electrical appliances, and the prevailing trend in this business area has a similar impact on the personal care market. The global market for personal care electrical personal care appliances has witnessed steady growth, and is expected to maintain this trend throughout the forecast period. The Asia-Pacific, Middle East, and Africa are expected to exhibit incremental growth during the forecast period due to growing awareness and rising disposable income. Brazil, Russia, India, and China (BRIC) are the countries with the highest growth potential during the forecast period. As per the present market scenario, North America generated the highest revenue in 2014, accounting for around two-fifths of the market value, and is expected to dominate the market throughout the analysis period. Asia-Pacific is projected to be the fastest growing market registering a CAGR of 13.4% from 2016 to 2022.

Published on October 03, 2016. Credit: Mobile Marketing Association Marketers should spend more on mobile: Just ask the Mobile Marketing Association. That claim is no surprise coming from the industry's trade group, and might even provoke eye rolls. But there's a key reason to believe the MMA, backed by its cross-device Smart Mobile Cross Marketing Effectiveness (SMoX) research, as the group's CEO, Greg Stuart, sees it: His board is made up of nearly two-thirds marketers -- including executives of Coca-Cola Co. and Unilever -- who have closely supervised and participated in the work. Unilever, whose Magnum ice cream brand is the focus of the latest SMoX study, is putting credence in the results and putting them to use, said Luis Di Como, Unilever senior VP-global media, who sits on the MMA board. "We have advertisers. We have mobile players. We have Facebook as well," said Mr. Di Como. "We have a good industry representation." Related Stories Mobile Data Marketplace Creates Direct Path From App to Dollars Google's Attack on Mobile Interstitials Provokes That Familiar Mix of Applause and Fear 'Campaign' Is a Dirty Word in Mobile Creativity MMA research has been vetted independently by the Advertising Research Foundation, Mr. Stuart noted. And its studies have been conducted with large panels of between 500,000 and 1 million consumers under the supervision of well-regarded marketing analytics firm Marketing Evolution. The eight published SMoX studies to date, conducted since 2014 with such marketers as Walmart, Coca-Cola, Mastercard and AT&T, concluded that all the marketers would have fared better -- either selling more products or converting more customers -- by increasing mobile media's share of their media budgets to the 15%-to-20% range from 5% to 9%, Mr. Stuart said. Somewhat ironically, the one mobile player in that group -- AT&T -- had the lowest mobile share of spending going into its study, he said. "Mobile is priced at half its value," Mr. Stuart said, based on the sales or conversion impact per dollar spent. That's not to say the gains will hold up if marketers pile their whole budgets into mobile. Marketing Evolution CEO Rex Briggs has pointed out in numerous interviews and presentations that optimal spending on mobile tends to top out at much lower levels than other media, because it doesn't take as much frequency to make an impact as other media. Saturation point Mr. Stuart said a mobile video ad only needs to hit its target three times to reach "total saturation," versus a frequency of 12 to 15 for cable TV. While it's not entirely clear why similar video advertising works and wears out faster in mobile than cable, it does raise questions about whether what counts as an impression is really equal between the media, and whether, for all the concern about digital viewability, concern should perhaps be greater about TV viewability. Of course, comparing mobile and TV is also complicated by the relative complexity of mobile. Where TV spending comes largely on 15- and 30-second ads, mobile encompasses display, video, native and search with parameters that include place and time. Part of SMoX has been looking at optimizing budgets not just by total weight, but also by type of mobile creative and targeting variables. Mobile Delivered About Twice the Impact Per Dollar Versus Other Media AT&T: Awareness of Moto X Phone Mobile: 1.9 Average: 1.0 Gold Peak Tea: Awareness of Gold Peak Tea Mobile: 4.8 Average: 1.0 Mastercard: Image: Use of MC when traveling Mobile: 1.7 Average: 1.0 Walmart: Sales in Store at Walmart Mobile: 2.0 Average: 1.0 Unilever, Magnum: Sales Mobile: 1.1 Average: 1.0 Coca-Cola (Brazil): Sales Mobile: 3.0 Average: 1.0 Coca-Cola (China): Sales Mobile: 2.0 Average: 1.0 Coca-Cola (U.K.): Sales Mobile: 2.0 Average: 1.0 Source: SMoX: A Few Key Insights, September 2016. Photos courtesy of Coca-Cola, Unilever, Walmart, Mastercard and AT&T. Optimizing by total mobile weight increased campaign performance -- either sales or other branding and conversion metrics -- by 4% to 12% (not counting a puzzling outlier from Coca-Cola in Brazil where sales rose a whopping 60%). But optimizing around creative type, location or other factors such as weather increased campaign impact 7% to 25%. The impact in one unpublished study from Subway was even higher, Mr. Stuart said. Mobile ads that the fast-feeder ran between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. had a whopping 14 times more sales impact than those run the rest of the day, he said. For Mr. Di Como, the key takeaway from the SMoX study of Unilever's Magnum ice cream brand was that "context boosts content," he said. The study looked at small and large bannerads and 15- and 30-second mobile video displayed mostly in apps from April to September 2015, using weather, location and time-based targeting. The study found increasing mobile's share of the media mix to 15% from the single digits would increase overall campaign profit performance 9%, and optimizing the creative and targeting within mobile would mean 17% of the media budget in mobile, with a 13% increase in profit versus the unoptimized mix. Using weather-based targeting to only serve the ice cream ads when the temperature was 80 degrees or higher increased aided awareness of the ad by 14% and profit ROI on investment by 50%. The study also found larger banners worked better than smaller ones, and that while mobile video was as effective as cable TV per impression, cable TV was 2.5 times more expensive. In video, 15-second ads proved 27% more effective than 30-second ones. Rich-media surprise But the most effective format actually was rich-media display -- a format that's fallen out of favor with many advertisers in recent years as they turned to video, often repurposed from their TV ads. Rich-media ads had four times the ROI of the campaign overall. While weather and location are clearly major factors for ice cream, Mr. Di Como said the study has implications for other brands as well. Hellmann's, for example, has found ads that run from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. are most effective, because that's when people are deciding what recipes they're going to use that evening. Mobile may still not be the biggest piece of most brands' budgets, but it is "at the center of our communication plans," Mr. Di Como said. "Our mantra is no mobile, no meeting," so that any media or creative provider has to include it in the conversation. But is it possible to get too targeted? Procter & Gamble Global Brand Officer Marc Pritchard recently said the company had done just that with Facebook and pulled back to more broad-reach plans on the social network. "Facebook provides all different ranges of targeting capabilities, from mass reach to hypertargeting, and we use both," Mr. Di Como said. Despite the power of weather and geolocation, along with personalized ads for Magnum, he said, the brand also has found it needs broader-reach mobile advertising to maximize its results. A recent ARF study found a considerable amount of digital and mobile advertising wasted by overkill -- basically serving the same ad to the same people to the point of diminishing or even negative returns. The relatively low cost and fast wearout makes that risk particularly acute in mobile. But Mr. Di Como believes the ability to use frequency caps in mobile buys in order to prevent oversaturating people -- a capability that Google said at Advertising Week it is introducing across devices -- actually makes it better than TV. "You can use frequency caps in the digital environment," he said, "where you can't do that in the traditional TV environment." Realistically, mobile and digital change so fast that the half-life of any research can be short. Only a few years ago, Unilever was focused on campaigns that were "social by design" to get organic, i.e., unpaid, reach. "We were one of the first ones to find there was a decay on that model," Mr. Di Como said. That came largely because of changes in Facebook's algorithm for serving brands' posts to followers. It puts a lot more emphasis on paying for mobile rather than maximizing free reach. At the same time, as Unilever spends more money on mobile, getting measurement right gets more important. So with Facebook in particular, Mr. Di Como said, "We were the first one to push to have third-party verification." So when Facebook announced recently that its own metrics had overstated average time spent viewing videos in recent years, Unilever wasn't surprised, because it had been getting its own viewership data from Moat, he said. "We have been working with Moat and Facebook in an open and supportive way," Mr. Di Como said, "to understand all of these viewability standards."

Meanwhile, activity in China's manufacturing sector expanded again in September, data released on 1 October 2016 showed. The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stood at 50.4 in September, identical with the previous month's level, the National Bureau of Statistics said. The non-manufacturing PMI rose to 53.7 from 53.5 in August.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) made the announcement after market hours on Friday, 30 September 2016. Meanwhile, India's manufacturing upturn was sustained in September, as a further increase in order books underpinned growth of output and purchasing activity, a survey showed today, 3 October 2016. That said, rates of expansion eased in all cases. One area of strength was external demand, with firms noting the strongest rise in new export orders since July 2015. Both input costs and output charges increased at quicker rates. Posting above the crucial 50 threshold for the ninth consecutive month, the seasonally adjusted Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 52.1 in September from 52.6 in August.

John Kasich talks about the presidential campaign, the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and other topics during the daily news briefing at the White House in Washington, Sept. 16, following a meeting with the president in the Oval Office. (Carolyn Kaster, Associated Press) Print Email Thomas Suddes, cleveland.com By Thomas Suddes, cleveland.com The Plain Dealer Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 02, 2016 at 5:04 AM, updated October 02, 2016 at 7:01 PM comments And Clinton fans wonder why Hillary and Bill Clinton's slicing and dicing of the English language ticks people off. John Kasich won't be on next month's ballot, but might want to be on 2020's. So, arguably, Ohio's Republican governor is continuing to run for president. August: John Kasich is getting the band back together in New Hampshire, perhaps with an eye on 2020 Kasich, whose term as governor will end in January 2019, is positioning himself as the adult in the room. Nationally, he's been making all the right moves as to Republican movers and shakers: big manufacturers and U.S.-based traders. Oh, and on Sept. 16 Kasich told NBC's Chuck Todd, "It's very, very likely I will not" vote for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. "The chances are minuscule," Kasich said. In mid-September, Kasich went to the White House (as a visitor) to join Democratic President Barack Obama in asking Congress to approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The partnership is a huge trade deal among the United States and 11 other nations (not including China). Kasich wants to help Obama pass Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal And on Sept. 15, The Wall Street Journal published a Kasich op-ed, "A vote against trade is a vote against growth." In contrast, Trump opposes the TPP. So does Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. One of her campaign's websites proclaims, "Hillary Clinton opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, period." But the word "now" seems to be missing from the Clinton campaign's statement: For, as Trump charged during Monday's debate, Clinton did say in 2012 — albeit, before the TPP had been finalized — that the TPP "sets the gold standard in trade agreements." (And Clinton fans wonder why Hillary and Bill Clinton's slicing and dicing of the English language ticks people off.) Also last week, Kasich joined former Defense Secretary Robert Gates (who served in Obama's Cabinet as well as George W. Bush's) in a Columbus foreign policy forum presented by an outfit called the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition. Among the coalition's chairman's caucus members ("most dedicated supporters") are Cincinnati's Procter & Gamble (one of Ohio's Fortune 500 companies), the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, Coca-Cola, Google, Microsoft and Walmart. John Kasich, Robert Gates pick at presidential candidates' foreign policy stances The coalition said that in 2015, "Ohio exported $50.7 billion in goods and services overseas, and trade supported more than one in five local jobs." The coalition, in case you're wondering, supports "strategic investments to elevate development and diplomacy and defense" — that is, trade.  On energy policy, Kasich has demonstrated Statehouse responsibility. For example, he said he would veto any bill that kills the benchmarks for solar and wind power that Ohio electricity producers must meet. The benchmarks are now frozen, but the freeze expires Dec. 31.  State Sen. William Seitz, a suburban Cincinnati Republican, is expected to massage a pending bill so it would replace the existing law's energy mandates and standards, which would otherwise kick in again Jan. 1. The General Assembly first approved the standards in 2008, virtually unanimously. For now, it's unclear whether there's enough support in the Ohio Senate and House for weakening the energy standards. But the Senate, controlled by Republicans continuously since January 1985, isn't exactly considered forward-thinking. On energy standards, Kasich is forward-thinking, as he was in expanding Medicaid, despite grandstanding yelps from the usual Capitol Square mossbacks.  In January 2021, on Inauguration Day for whoever's elected president in 2020, Kasich will be 68; Clinton 73; Trump 74. So there's nothing fantastical about what Kasich's doing.  RNC Chairman Reince Priebus says GOP could bar John Kasich from another presidential run Whether Clinton wins next month (at this writing, she's leading Trump in the RealClear Politics poll average), or Trump wins, voters will likely be in the market for change in 2020. That's why Kasich will keep on keeping on, making sure the GOP's power brokers see his resume, know his face — and remember his name.

Published on October 03, 2016. Reprints Reprints Corinna Falusi. Credit: Mother Most Popular Mother New York has hired Ogilvy & Mather New York Chief Creative Officer Corinna Falusi as CCO and partner, effective Dec 1. Paul Malmstrom, founding partner and CCO at Mother New York, is shifting to the role of creative chairman. Ms. Falusi, who was promoted from executive creative director to New York CCO at Ogilvy in January 2015, will be responsible for all creative at Mother New York. Mr. Malmstrom will still play a creative role at the agency, but his new post will allow him to have more flexibility and select specific projects to focus on, according to a Mother New York spokesperson. During her time at Ogilvy New York, Ms. Falusi worked on big-name accounts including Coke Zero, Coca-Cola, Amex OPEN, Tiffany and Ikea. "We feel Corinna belongs here at Mother," Mr. Malmstrom said in a statement. "She has a magical mix of talent, ambition, and soulfulness. With her, we'll continue to bring even greater expressions of creativity to our clients." Prior to Ogilvy, Ms. Falusi worked at smaller creative shops StrawberryFrog, in Amsterdam as well as New York, and Jung Von Matt in Hamburg. There she helped work on a portfolio including brands such as New Balance, Frito-Lay, Heineken, P&G's Pampers, Audi, BMW and MTV. "It has been a joy having Corinna lead our creative department for the past year," an Ogilvy & Mather spokeswoman said. "We wish her all the best on her next chapter at Mother." Last September, former professional rugby player Peter Ravailhe joined Mother New York as CEO, succeeding Andrew Deitchman, who left to pursue an opportunity with a media and retail concept.

Reprints Reprints 20161003_Last Word_martech Credit: Kelsey Dake Most Popular Here's a neat party trick if we're ever in the same room and you want to see my eyes roll all the way into the back of my head and my entire body shut down as if I were some sort of robot that's just been unplugged. Turn to our glossary on page 16. See those words? Just start using any of them and I'm done for. To be fair, if you're a creative and you start using some of your made-up creative words like ideate, or you turn concept into a verb, I'll shut down, too. But I'm a creativist at heart. (See, I can make up words, too. Creationist was already taken.) I like smart branding campaigns. I think companies still have to cast a wide net to reach a wide target to convince people beyond power users to sample their wares. Hell, I like seeing a good 30-second spot—as rare as those are—plopped into the middle of my broadcast or cable TV. But I also get the quest for extremely precise targeting, the desire for automation and that basic need to feel like you're spending your marketing dollars on something that delivers concrete results. It's just that marketing tech works so hard to be boring. Part of me wants to make some clever analogy along the lines that obsessing over marketing tech is like obsessing over whether your TV picture is delivered by tubes or diodes. But the analogy doesn't hold up. And it's just wrongheaded: based partly on my resistance to technology taking over everything and partly on the fact that it's all just so damn confusing. As a writer, even I can admit that sometimes words fail. And you can pile up all the right words in just the right order and the workings of programmatic and marketing tech don't become any clearer. Even after you strip away all the acronyms and the jargon. And please don't point to the Lumascape. The Lumascape is not helpful, unless further confusing the issue is considered helpful. Hey. We took all the companies working in the space and put their names and logos on a piece of paper. Now do you get it? No. Hell, it wasn't until Rubicon Project's Jay Sears came to the office and drew pictures and flowcharts for us that it started to seep into my thick skull. It doesn't exactly get the blood racing. But it is fascinating in its own way. And it's something we'll be covering more and more, because it's also important. At the heart of all this, of course, is data. Despite what latter-day Don Drapers will tell you, marketing's always been data-obsessed. And while we've gotten better and better at collecting and storing data, the issue now is what to do with it, how to sift through it and use it and, just as important, how to keep it safe. And this needs to be done in a calm, collected manner without trying to instill fear or confusion in the hearts of marketers. That's another reason I don't like the Lumascape. I feel like there's an implied message that you should be totally overwhelmed by the topic and go running to the nearest consultant for help. "There's so much noise around ad tech, martech," Neustar CEO Lisa Hook recently told me when she and CMO Steven Wolfe Pereira stopped by Ad Age HQ. I'd asked her about the Lumascape, all those companies making up an entire universe. "They're products or product fragments," she said, adding that that isn't necessarily a bad thing. "It's a green-field environment. Let a thousand flowers bloom." But she does see that universe shrinking. "In three or four years I don't really see anybody talking about martech or ad tech." Yes, the money is still flowing into marketing tech. In a recent Wall Street Journal piece, Jack Marshall noted that PitchBook data showed that venture capital investment for martech companies reached over $1.2 billion last year and is expected to surpass that this year. But, Marshall pointed out, "For many marketing and ad tech companies, the goal is to ultimately sell to a larger player." Hook, who's got a legal background, a thing for good grammar and a sly sense of humor, didn't even use the phrase martech until I brought it up, causing her to roll her eyes. "We hate the descriptor," she said. She sees her own company as in the information-services space. Which is not a surprise considering it sits on so much of it. The company got its start managing the North American Numbering Plan—in other words, all the phone numbers on the continent. It's also the registry operator for .biz and .us, among others. And it provides DNS services. And after a string of acquisitions in the early 2000s, it moved into marketing and security services, everything from fraud protection to targeting to data onboarding and analytics. "At some point, we realized marketing is going to absolutely need to know who they're talking to." For a creativist like myself, it all sounds vaguely scary. You think about all the data out there and all the companies moving it around, where do you even start? How many pieces do you need to stitch together? "To be successful as a marketer today, I have to run an IT department, and I'm going to be so distracted," said Hook. "It's like a Rube Goldberg machine for marketing. It's crazy." The smart marketer isn't going to get bogged down in those details. As P&G CMO Marc Pritchard said to agencies earlier this year, "Frankly, your complexity should not be our problem, so we want you to make that complexity invisible." Ultimately that's going to apply to tech vendors as well. Hook agrees. "Tech is a component, it's a tool that you use to get the answer. … How do you create the machine that's super elegant, you hit the button and the answer comes out?" When it comes to marketing tech, she says, "Boring is good. Boring delivers." The goal of any successful martech or adtech or information services company, she says, should be to make it all seem easy so that marketers can go back to worrying about campaigns and creativity and strategy. Maybe it's just me, but I find that kind of talk sort of exciting.

John Dickerman, head of the Washington DC office for the CBI, was speaking on a visit to the North East where he met with firms in the region to update them on the trading climate between the UK and the US. He said the famed “special relationship” built on shared history, language and the rule of law was still intact, but that those bonds needed attention in the wake of the UK’s vote to leave the European Union . Tensions surrounding the US presidential election , with both candidates looking to protect American jobs, and the failure to agreed the TTIP trade deal, also showed the fragile nature of trade links between the two countries. Those issues make it more important than ever for North East companies to look for export opportunities in the US, but Mr Dickerman said too many firms targeted places like New York and Los Angeles and ignored the chances to do business in smaller regional centres. He said: “It may seem like a simple market to invest in because of the shared law and language links but in reality it’s 50 different markets. “Make sure you have the right location picked out, make sure you have the right partners in that location and understand that if one week you invest in California, it doesn’t mean that next week you can open an office in New York as well. “Making sure you look at location is very important. The notion of regional centres is as important in the US as it is in the UK. We would have the tendency to call some of these places secondary markets in the US, but they’re not secondary, they’re just smaller than the established markets. Cities like Denver, for example, of Portland Oregon, or Seattle. There are fantastic opportunities and, talking practically, there are huge tax breaks too and it can be much easier to get your goods to market.” In a bulletin to members earlier this year, the CBI highlighted the extensive nature of trade links between Britain and America, pointing out that UK firms were investing in every state while many US firms, such as Procter & Gamble, were major players in regions like the North East. But the bulletin said that “there is so much work to be done to make it easier for British and American businesses to invest in each other’s economies, trade with one another, and move across each other’s borders.” Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Business Newsletter Follow @EveningChron Subscribe to our Business newsletterEnter emailSubscribe Comments Show more comments More On European Union US presidential elections Politics business all Most Read Most Recent Eldon SquareRed's True Barbecue creates 80 jobs at £1.2m Newcastle restaurant The firm is making final preparations for its 165-cover restaurant at intu Eldon Square's Grey's Quarter MetroCentreStationery brand Staples is to disappear after struggling business is sold The chain, which has stores at the Metrocentre and on Teesside, has been bought by restructuring firm that also owns HMV NewburnNewcastle technology firm True Potential makes UK growth list for three years running True Potential and fellow Newcastle firm Performance Horizon are only North East entries on the Deloitte Technology Fast 50 Newcastle City CentreNew four-star Maldron Hotel set to open in Newcastle city centre This will be the first Maldron Hotel to open in the UK, as part of the Newgate Street redevelopment Newcastle City CentreTen-storey Newcastle student scheme to go back before planners Nixon Homes has submitted new plans for a student block on St James' Boulevard in Newcastle city centre CramlingtonTommee Tippee respond to 300 help offers in search of 'little blue cup' The Cramlington firm's social media team are set to reveal how many special cups have been found for autistic Ben Carter Eldon SquareRed's True Barbecue creates 80 jobs at £1.2m Newcastle restaurant The firm is making final preparations for its 165-cover restaurant at intu Eldon Square's Grey's Quarter Newcastle City CentreTen-storey Newcastle student scheme to go back before planners Nixon Homes has submitted new plans for a student block on St James' Boulevard in Newcastle city centre The Co-operativeCo-op extends support to British farming with pledge to double local suppliers The Co-op small business charter has been welcomed by Farming Minister George Eustice and the NFU NewburnNewcastle technology firm True Potential makes UK growth list for three years running True Potential and fellow Newcastle firm Performance Horizon are only North East entries on the Deloitte Technology Fast 50 Most Read Most Recent Newcastle United FCNewcastle United news LIVE: Rafa Benitez's press conference at 1pm - here's everything he said All the latest from the Newcastle United camp as Rafa Benitez gets his troops ready for Elland Road and speaks to the media ahead of it Newbiggin-by-the-seaTeenager 'extremely distressed' after stranger rape in Newbiggin-by-the-Sea The 14-year-old was walking down a back lane when her attacker grabbed her from behind and sexually assaulted her North TynesideTwo new Metro stations could be built to cope with thousands of proposed homes North Tyneside Council's Local Plan includes proposals for new stations to serve Murton Gap and Killingworth Moor NorthumberlandRoad blocked by an overturned lorry which shed its load has reopened The A697, near to Powburn, Northumberland, was closed for nine hours after a lorry overturned on Friday morning BykerByker care home bleach tablet death: inquest is set to take place in New Year Safeguarding meeting to come at Balmoral Court in Newcastle following resident's tragic death in August NorthumberlandRoad blocked by an overturned lorry which shed its load has reopened The A697, near to Powburn, Northumberland, was closed for nine hours after a lorry overturned on Friday morning NHSHospital parking: What rules do North East hospitals have and who can park for free?

In Sri Lanka to commence the initiative and run some of Interbrand’s most respected processes – including Brand Strength and Role of Brand – is Ashish Mishra, Managing Director, Interbrand India, and his senior strategy and client team. Sri Lankan brand consultancy Michel Nugawela Designs will partner Interbrand for the duration of the programme and leverage its brand engagement processes that drive high performance brand cultures. Established in 1974 and an opinion leader in the field of value-based brand management, Interbrand was the first brand consultancy to recognize the significance of a brand as a business asset and introduce the brand valuation concept. With a network of over 33 offices in 27 countries, Interbrand’s combination of rigorous strategy, analytics, and world-class design enables it to assist clients in creating and managing brand value effectively, across all touchpoints, in all market dynamics. Its annual Best Global Brands report, the definitive guide to the world’s 100 most valuable brands and now in its 17th year, valuates each brand’s financial performance, role, and strength through a five-step Economic Value Added methodology which is also the first of its kind to be ISO certified. Interbrand recently launched the inaugural Interbrand Breakthrough Brands report, in partnership with Facebook, Ready Set Rocket, and the New York Stock Exchange. The report is unique in that it examines emerging companies that are brand-led – organizations that have both unique business models and strong brands. The report complements Interbrand’s Best Global Brands report by putting a spotlight on emerging brands – especially those that are affecting change and embodying growth. Interbrand’s portfolio of services include research and analytics to gain deep understanding of unmet needs and opportunities related to brands, customers or markets; strategy that defines the purpose, identity, and role of brands to create differentiation and value for businesses; the creation and integration of products, services, behaviours, communications, and environments that build holistic experiences that connect people and brands in unique ways; and strategic planning, technology platforms, and internal engagement that bring a brand experience to market and strengthen internal marketing and brand management capabilities. Interbrand’s impressive portfolio of clients include brand leaders in every industry, category and segment including HSBC, American Express, Credit Suisse, Barclays, Swiss Re, Allstate, and Bank of America in financial services; GE, Shell, IBM, KPMG and Godrej in diversified sectors; FedEx, UPS, DHL, British Airways, KLM, Thai, Iberia, Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines and Maersk in logistics and transportation; Unilever, P&G, Nestle, Kraft, Nivea, Knorr and Wrigley in CPG/FMCG; FIFA, Rugby Football Union, Ryder Cup, USGA and Sochi Olympics in sport branding; Gucci, Prada, Rolls Royce, Cartier, Piaget, Hugo Boss, Bulgari and Remy Martin in the luxury segment; as well as cities, regions and nations such as Edinburgh, Johannesburg, Monitoba, South Korea, Holland and Chile. Interbrand also created the first Korean Top 100 brand, Samsung, by introducing the brand value concept to the conglomerate and propelling it to the 7th most valuable brand ranking in the Best Global Brands table, worth over $45bn in 2015.    Hits: 209     Send to Friend               Breaking News Await Breaking News Last Updated Nov 17 2016 | 09:18 pm ...   Featured News Microsoft defines technological... 2016-11-17 Read More   Learning Medicine from Maneka... 2016-11-17 Read More   Mahinda urged to take over SLPF 2016-11-17 Read More   The Island 35 Anniversary 2016-11-18 Read More         ARCHIVES RELATED LINKS Friday, 18th November 2016 [Current Issue] Thursday, 17th November 2016 Wednesday, 16th November 2016 Tuesday, 15th November 2016 Monday, 14th November 2016 Sunday, 13th November 2016 More Archives World Clock Currency Rates Weather     UPALI NEWSPAPERS (PVT) LTD Copyright © Upali Newspapers (Pvt) Ltd.
