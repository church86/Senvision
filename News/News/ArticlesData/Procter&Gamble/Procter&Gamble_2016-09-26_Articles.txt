( ) Print Email Stephen Koff, cleveland.com By Stephen Koff, cleveland.com The Plain Dealer Follow on Twitter on September 27, 2016 at 1:29 PM, updated September 28, 2016 at 9:33 AM comments WASHINGTON -- Some of Ohio's most prominent companies, including Procter & Gamble, Timken and Invacare, told President Barack Obama's administration today that regulations intended to crack down on corporate tax loopholes will harm businesses instead. The 47 companies' concern is a set of rules designed to keep corporations from shifting their ownership to lower-tax countries in a set of unusual transactions, with a smaller foreign company buying a larger U.S.-based one. This is known as a corporate inversion, and companies that have inverted include Mentor-based Steris and Cleveland-based Eaton Corp., both now part of once-smaller companies based in, respectively, Great Britain and Ireland. These and other companies that already operated internationally justify their moves as making sense for strategic global-business reasons. But the Obama administration and other critics note that inversions result in shifting corporate profits to headquarters in countries with lower tax rates. The inversion may change little if anything in U.S. operations. Even though they're now based abroad, the corporations can still get U.S. government contracts, for example. But a foreign headquarters saves the company money on income taxes -- or, as critics see it, costs the United States tax revenue. Moving offshore? Here, have another contract. In April, the Treasury Department released rules and proposals to clamp down. The clampdown, however, could create more harm than good, say the Ohio businesses, in a letter to Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew. The letter was signed by, among others, Procter & Gamble, Timken, Invacare, Steris, Whirlpool, Cardinal Health, Forest City Realty Trust, and Ohio-based operations of Nestle, Anheuser-Bush, Miller Coors and the Kraft Heinz Company.  Most of these companies are headquartered in the United States and have not announced plans to change that. The problem is that the proposed regulations would affect any company with cross-border operations, regardless of whether it inverted, according to the Organization for International Investment, another critic of the proposal. The proposed regulations "go far beyond Treasury's stated intent to curtail abusive transactions," the letter from the Ohio companies said. "If the regulations were to become final in their current form, they would significantly impede the ability of our businesses to invest and create jobs in Ohio." What Obama wants to do: Part of what Treasury rolled out in April used existing authority to restrict tax savings for so-called serial inverters -- companies that inverted overseas and then, within three years, became part of yet another inversion scheme with another U.S.-based company. Without the tax savings, the companies would lose an incentive to merge. The announcement served to kill a planned merger by U.S.-based Pfizer, a pharmaceutical maker, with Allergan, which is based in Ireland as a result of earlier mergers. Another part of the restrictions -- the one addressed specifically by the Ohio companies -- is not yet final. It would restrict a technique used to shift debt from a foreign operation to a U.S.-based affiliate. This gives the appearance that the U.S. operation has lower earnings (because of the debt), reducing its U.S tax obligation. The Obama administration wants to restrict this practice -- called earnings stripping -- unless the debt is actually used to finance U.S. business operations. The change would recharacterize certain debt instruments as equity -- also known as stock. This would then affect the tax deductions of interest payments on the debt, some of which might have to be treated as dividends instead. The IRS would make the determinations. Why the companies object: If the IRS interjects itself in decisions about what is and isn't legitimate debt, the Ohio companies contend, it will result in unfounded and possibly unfair decisions. The main points of the companies' complaint: "The proposed regulations will complicate, and in some cases eliminate, our companies' ability to self-finance our job growth and could obstruct access to capital." "The broad language of the regulations creates uncertainty resulting in serious hesitation to make long-term commitments in an already challenging business environment. The regulations would inflict significant costs on our businesses, with no direct or indirect benefit to consumers, by mandating new and extensive tracking, documentation and compliance requirements." "Finally, the subjective nature of the regulations and the new bifurcation authority given to the IRS would all-but ensure compliance issues and increased controversy." What happens next: Complaints from businesses have rolled in, and some of the Ohio companies already signed comments sent to Treasury. A date for finalizing the regulations has not been announced but is likely soon. The Business Roundtable and other leading corporate groups have already said they expect the regulations to be challenged in court if they are finalized as proposed. Today's letter simply lays down another marker from the business community. How politics enter the picture: The letter was prepared and circulated well before Monday night's presidential debate. But the topic of corporate taxes and loopholes became fodder in the debate as Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton said she supported efforts to bring back "money that's stranded overseas." Republican Donald Trump said lower corporate tax rates would solve the problem. "I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses," Trump said. At 35 percent, this country's federal corporate tax rate is the world's highest. But analysts point out that many companies use tax strategies and deductions to avoid paying that rate. That's a point used by both sides, one that wants to curtail the use of loopholes and the other that says a lower, more equitable rate would eliminate the need for tax gamesmanship. Trump's remarks -- and the Ohio businesses' letter -- goes to a point made repeatedly by other Republicans including U.S. Sen. Rob Portman. Portman, who also faces an election in November, says Congress needs to rework the corporate tax code in a comprehensive way rather than tackling it a piece at a time. Portman's office today played a role in making sure the businesses' letter got out to the press. "This letter is just another sign that one-off solutions to combat inversions and foreign acquisitions are not the answer to cure our broken tax code," Portman said in a statement. "These new, complex rules will make our already burdensome tax laws even more complicated, and, as the letter states, will make it harder for businesses to grown and create jobs here at home." The answer, Portman said, is "comprehensive international tax reform that lets businesses invest and create jobs here in the United States."

About Us Our People Advertising News Sports Shows Weather Outdoors West Virginia P&G plant flooded with applicants wvmetronews.com A recent flyover shows how much progress has been made on the P&G site. Share Article By Brad McElhinny in News | September 27, 2016 at 11:02AM CHARLESTON, W.Va. — Procter & Gamble’s new plant in the Eastern Panhandle has drawn 1,100 applicants already — so many the company had to shut down its application portal for a few months last spring. “We were getting so much traction that we couldn’t keep up with the demand,” said P&G spokesman Jeff LeRoy. The application portal is back open, and Procter & Gamble has hired its first 18 plant technicians for the $500 million Tabler Station facility that will eventually produce products like Bounce fabric enhancers, shampoos and body wash. “It’s more applicants than we expected at this point,” LeRoy said. “We were getting overwhelmed early on. We didn’t expect it to be so fast. We’re extremely pleased. That was one of the reasons that attracted us to this area of West Virginia.” Eventually, Procter & Gamble expects to employ 700 full-time workers at the facility, which is about four miles south of Martinsburg. “This moment is what it’s all about,” said Keith Burdette, executive director of the state Development Office. “All the work that goes into recruiting a company and bringing a project to fruition –  it’s all about the moment when we get to see hard working West Virginians begin careers that will support their families for generations to come. And P&G is one of the best companies to work for in the world. The impact it’s going to have on this state is huge, and it starts now.” Of the first 18 employees, a dozen are already Eastern Panhandle residents, two are from other places in West Virginia, and the others are from Maryland and Virginia. “Of the 18, a quarter are veterans, several are women. It’s a diverse group,” LeRoy said. Those 18 have already started preparing for their work at P&G. “They’re in a training program now,” LeRoy said. “We expect to continue to accept applications now through the plant opening next fall and beyond.” LeRoy said P&G looks for standouts among 5 “buckets of skills”: mechanical skills or aptitude, electrical skills or aptitude, people with experience in manufacturing and production, making and packing operations and people with experience in equipment and machinery operations. “We’re looking for not only people who have skills in certain areas, but who demonstrate a range of expertise,” LeRoy said. “We’re looking for people who show interest personally too. If somebody is really into mechanical applications, we find that they do that in their personal life as well.” Jobseekers must begin with the P&G’s website portal, which starts with an online application and then moves on to an online skills assessment before potentially progressing to an in-person interview. “It’s not ‘Do you know a friend?’ or ‘Your cousin works at P&G.’ You have to go through that portal,” LeRoy said. LeRoy suggested that applicants who need to improve their skills should enroll at Blue Ridge Community and Technical College, which has a partnership with P&G. “We expect as we go forward to hire more people out of Blue Ridge,” LeRoy said. “If someone doesn’t have the skills or they’re concerned they might not, I would recommend them to Blue Ridge.” This is just the second new plant Procter & Gamble has built since 1971. It’s expected to open in 2017. “We’re just at the beginning of this journey,” LeRoy said.

According to a recent survey by Marketing Week, 26 percent of marketers report there are no people from ethnic minorities in their team, while 27 percent said there were no lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender people and 51 percent that their departments lacked people with physical or mental disabilities.   Yet Procter & Gamble’s European brand boss Sophie Blum insists diversity is a “game changer” and key to her own company’s business success.   Speaking specifically about gender diversity after her talk at the Dmexco ad tech conference in Germany recently, she cites figures showing that P&G recruits a 50/50 gender balance, while 45 percent of its managers are female and women make up 40 percent of its board, according to Marketing Week.   She suggests diversity is not something new and that it has required a “long-lasting investment in culture” to achieve.   “Diversity is a measure, inclusion is a skill. The skill requires culture and it’s a topic for everyone. It is about creating this balance,” she told Marketing Week.   “Leveraging diversity on background, gender, ethnicity is a recipe for happiness and unleashing the potential of the personal and professional life. Since I joined P&G, [diversity] was very anchored in the business strategy and it is proven that diversity delivers better results.”   Read about her thoughts on marketing’s diversity problem and more in the full article here.

The study finds that women fall behind early and face ever-greater challenges the more senior they become. Women are less likely to receive the first critical promotion to manager—so far fewer end up on the path to leadership—and they are less likely to be hired into more senior positions. As a result, the higher you look in companies, the fewer women you see. "When women are stuck, corporate America is stuck," said Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook COO and founder of LeanIn.Org. "We know that diverse teams perform better and inclusive workplaces are better for all employees, so we all have strong incentives to get this right." The Women in the Workplace 2016 report is part of an ongoing partnership between McKinsey & Company and LeanIn.Org to give companies the information they need to promote female leadership and foster gender equality in the workplace. The study is based on pipeline data and information on human resources practices from 132 companies that employ more than 4.6 million people, including Visa, MetLife, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Procter & Gamble, Facebook, and General Motors. In addition, more than 34,000 employees completed a survey designed to explore their experiences regarding gender, opportunity, career, and work-life issues. The study builds on the Women in the Workplace 2015 report and a baseline study of sixty companies conducted by McKinsey & Company in 2012. "To accelerate progress on gender parity, we first must understand what is holding women back," said Dominic Barton, global managing partner of McKinsey & Company. "This study seeks to do exactly that. It provides companies with both industry benchmarks and data on their own talent pipeline and employees' work experiences. These insights will help companies drive bolder and more effective solutions." Contrary to conventional wisdom, this year's study found that women negotiate for promotions and raises as often as men, but face pushback when they do. They are far more likely than men who negotiate to receive feedback that they are "intimidating," "too aggressive," or "bossy." Women also receive informal feedback less frequently than men—despite asking for it as often—and have less access to senior-level sponsors. So not surprisingly, women are almost three times more likely than men to think their gender will make it harder to get a raise, promotion, or chance to get ahead. The study found that, compared to white women, women of color face the most barriers and experience the steepest drop-offs with seniority despite having higher aspirations for becoming a top executive. Women of color also report they get less access to opportunities and see a workplace that is less fair and inclusive. They are 9% less likely to say they've received a challenging new assignment, 21% less likely to think the best opportunities go to the most deserving employees, and 10% less likely to feel comfortable being themselves as work. Although company commitment to gender diversity is at an all-time high, companies are struggling to put their commitment into practice. Less than half of employees say their company is doing what it takes to improve diversity, and many employees do not see gender diversity as a personal priority. The report identifies concrete steps companies can take to advance their gender diversity efforts. They can make a stronger case for gender diversity, explaining why it matters and how it benefits everyone. They can also ensure their hiring, promotion, and performance review polices are fair, and invest in training so employees know the steps they can take to promote gender diversity. And they can place more emphasis on accountability and set gender targets so it's easier to track and make progress. The complete Women in the Workplace 2016 report, including detailed findings and recommendations, is available at womenintheworkplace.com. From the website, organizations can download the report and sign up to participate in this ongoing research. QUOTES FROM PARTICIPATING CEOS Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co."At JPMorgan Chase, we foster a diverse and inclusive workplace where everyone can thrive. We believe it's not only the smart thing to do, it's the right thing to do and it's also good for business. We've implemented a number of initiatives aimed at helping make sure women advance and achieve their career goals at our company. This study will help us continue to build on the momentum we've attained." Charles Scharf, CEO of Visa"At Visa, advancing diversity and inclusion is a strategic imperative. Data from this Women in the Workplace study has reaffirmed the reality that there is still a lot more work to be done in both investing in and advancing women in the workplace. Dialogue is critical, along with swift action. As one of several initiatives we have in place to advance this discussion, Visa recently joined a consortium that brings together companies who are as committed as we are to addressing the issues around equal pay to ensure the right questions are being asked." David Taylor, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Procter & Gamble"We aspire to create a better world for everyone—a world free of gender bias with equal representation and an equal voice for women and men. This begins inside our own company, where we're striving for equal representation for women and men at all levels and building an inclusive culture where everyone can contribute to their full potential. We seek insights that can shed light and inspire action to achieve gender equality—inside our workplace and more broadly in the world." KEY FINDINGS For every 100 women promoted to manager, 130 men are promotedPromotion rates for women lag behind those of men, and the disparity is the largest at the first step up to manager. As a result, far fewer women end up on the path to leadership. Very few women are in line to become CEOBy the time women reach the SVP level, they hold just 20% of line roles, and line roles lead more directly to the C-suite: In 2015, 90% of new CEOs in the S&P 500 were promoted or hired from line roles. Women experience an uneven playing fieldWomen get less access to the people and opportunities that advance careers and are disadvantaged in many of their daily interactions. These inequities appear to take a toll on women: They are less likely to think they have equal opportunities for growth and development—and more likely to think their gender will play a role in missing out on a raise, promotion, or chance to get ahead. Women of color have higher leadership aspirations, but face more barriers Compared to white women, women of color have higher aspirations to become a top executive but get less access to opportunities for growth and advancement. They also see a workplace that is less fair and inclusive. In all cases, Black women appear to be the most disadvantaged. Women are negotiating as often as men—but face pushback when they do Women who negotiate for a promotion or compensation increase are 30% more likely than men who negotiate to receive feedback that they are "bossy," "too aggressive," or "intimidating." Women get less access to senior leadersWomen and men both view sponsorship by senior leaders as essential for success. Yet women report fewer substantive interactions with senior leaders than their male counterparts do—and this gap widens as women and men advance. Women ask for feedback as often as men—but are less likely to receive itDespite asking for informal feedback as often as men do, women report they receive it less frequently. Moreover, there appears to be a disconnect in the way managers convey difficult feedback. Most managers say they rarely hesitate to give difficult feedback to both women and men, but women report they receive it less frequently.   Women are less interested in becoming top executives—and see the pros and cons of senior leadership differentlyOnly 40% of women are interested in becoming top executives, compared to 56% of men. Women and men worry equally about work-life balance and company politics. However, women with and without children are more likely to say they don't want the pressure, and women who want a top job anticipate a steeper path than men who do. Companies are highly committed to gender diversity, but struggling to put it into practiceLess than half of employees think their company is doing what it takes to improve gender diversity. In addition, less than a third of employees say senior leaders regularly communicate the importance of gender diversity and are held accountable for making progress. There are steps companies can take to promote gender equalityAlthough there's no "one size fits all" solution, the report identifies steps companies can take to advance gender equality: make a compelling case for gender diversity; ensure hiring, promotions, and reviews are fair; invest in more employee training; and focus on accountability and results.

IMAGE: Big challenge for Girish Singhania to train unemployed youth . Photographs, kind courtesy: Edubridge     When Girish Singhania, 33, was working with Procter & Gamble (P&G), he noticed a wide gap in what the company needed for its sales force in rural areas. There were hundreds of unemployed youth willing to work for the company, but they were not suitable as they had no soft skills or training. Even if they found suitable persons for the job, retaining them was a huge challenge. Singhania, an Indian Institute of Management Bangalore (IIM-B), alumnus, worked with P&G for two years before moving to investment banking in Edelweiss in Mumbai, but the idea and his experience stayed with him. His job at Edelweiss required him to talk to investors in various countries and discussions with them made him see that they were looking for investment opportunities in the education sector. The second year of his work at Edelweiss made him travel to almost 100 villages across India in four states (in connection with some offerings from Edelweiss). In October 2009, Singhania – then 25 - decided to set up EduBridge, a company that would be socially relevant but would also make money. Operations started in July 2010. The idea was to train the unemployed youth in semi -urban and rural areas and train them well. IMAGE: Average salaries are typically Rs 10,000 a month for students.     The model The training is for entry-level service-sector jobs, which typically last one to three months, after which 300-350 recruiters hire them. The cost of the training - which is between Rs 10,000 and Rs 15,000 - is paid partly by the student and partly by government-funded skill development programmes or companies’ corproate social responsibility schemes. It focuses on spoken English, computer basics, soft skills, and personality development. Then, there is a module that trains them for specific jobs. They are placed at call centres, food and coffee chains, hospitality (hotels and restaurants) and banking. Average salaries are typically Rs 10,000 a month for students whose average family income is Rs 6,500 a month. Funding and future plans In the initial years, the company raised debt funding (Rs 3.5 crore) from National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) in 2011 and it raised equity funding through Acumen in 2012. The company has been profitable three years in a row since 2013-14 although the numbers are not public. Six months ago, the first big breakthrough came in funding when it raised $2.5 million (global funding companies like Insitor and Acumen have both invested). The money has helped Singhania invest in technology and grow faster. It is adding 25 new employees and four-five centres every month. The goal is to reach 100 centres by December 2016 with a total employee strength of 500. Doing it differently EduBridge is not the only company in this space. It is competing with large players such as Teamlease, ILFS, NIIT, etc, but Acumen India head Ajit Mahadevan says the problem with companies in the ed-tech space is that as they scale, their quality suffers. EduBridge has scaled very slowly. In the first five years, the company had 20 centres. It is only in the past year and a half - and after its latest round of funding - that it is growing at a much faster pace. By the year-end, it expects to touch 100 centres and will have 500 employees on board, several of whom are graduates of IIMs and Indian School of Business, Hyderabad. Second, the company has managed to keep a strict check on quality by keeping all its 150 trainers on the rolls. “We use our franchises only for infrastructure and their ability to mobilise the unemployed youth at the centre,” explains Singhania, arguing that keeping the training entirely under their control ensures quality. This is unlike many competitors who outsource trainers.  A third factor that distinguishes EduBridge is that it works almost as hard to retain its trainees as in training them. For every hundred people trained, only around 50 stay on the job. Realising this, the company started a helpline for its trainees – especially those who leave the jobs but at a later stage want to join again. Singhania says the training they give now works just as much on “mind sets as skill sets” since retaining those trained is critical. NSDC’s Jaikant Singh, head for partnerships and state engagement, says he sees no comparison between EduBridge and its present rivals. “Comparing EduBridge to ILFS or Teamlease is like comparing Aam Aadmi Party to Bharatiya Janata Party or Congress, which have been around for a long time.” He says unlike others who do training along with “whatever else they do”, EduBridge’s bread and butter is training.  EXPERT TAKE: V Gayathri It’s been a consistent journey for EduBridge, going by its achievements in training and placement in different sectors. The leadership team is quite focused on making a social impact combined with profitability that can be sustained. Though they have been cautious, it’s time for them to speed up and explore the growing market in the business-to-government segment, particularly with the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana and the Skill India Mission. This will strengthen EduBridge’s presence in the market through a variety of training programmes linked with employment. To grow further, it is also important that it execute the projects with utmost quality and meet standards such as The National Skills Qualification Framework. Another challenge it needs to overcome is that its training results in appropriate placement and the candidates become its ambassadors to spread the positive results. And, instead of limiting to entry level skill-based training, it can also explore other sources of revenue by addressing the needs for higher order skills meant for career progression. I’m confident its model can be scaled to accommodate the emerging needs from the industry and the job market. V Gayathri, chief executive officer, LabourNet Services India Pvt. Ltd. FACT BOX Number of centres: 75 in 14 states  Numbers trained in 2015: 30,000  Cost of training: Rs 10,000-15,000  Duration of training: 1 to 3 months  Total employees: 330 Trainees’ placements:  IT/ITeS (Data entry operator and call centre agents) – Serco, Tata Business Support Solutions, Hinduja Global, etc  Retail:  Shoppers Stop, The Mobile Store, Arvind Brands, Westside, etc  Banks: HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, etc  NBFCs: HDB Financials, Fullerton, Mahindra Finance, DHFL, etc  Hospitality: Café Coffee Day, KFC and so on  Others – Paytm Anjuli Bhargava.

The MMA Marketing Attribution Think Tank (MATT) is backed by 24 of the trade body's members, including Allstate, Bank of America, 1-800Flowers.com, Procter & Gamble, The Coca-Cola Company and Unilever. Its first initiative will be to look at multi-touch attribution (MTA) – the "Holy Grail" for the industry. "It likely is the biggest thing mobile marketers will ever take on," Greg Stuart, CEO of the MMA, said in describing MATT's mission. "We need to rethink what we're doing with the billions of dollars that we are spending on behalf of shareholders to invest in building a business or a brand. And we do not have the tools to do that today. "So we are going to seek to give marketers better measurements, better tools, and, most importantly, the confidence to apply some of these next-generation measurement tools, in effect connecting marketing to business outcomes. Because that is what has been missing." Many marketers, Stuart continued, lack the knowledge and experience to make sense of the current landscape, not least because there are a huge number of vendors offering many different modeling solutions. The 20 providers assessed in detail by the MMA, for instance, used 25 separate techniques. In response, MATT's goal will be to "help marketers to select the right partner for them to work with, the right MTA provider, and apply that with confidence to their business," Stuart explained. As further support for this objective, the MMA found that the marketers already using MTA gave it a -35 Net Promoter Score, a figure that Stuart compared with the -10 registered by budget motel chain Motel 6. "So we have a lot of work to do," he stated. "We're really going to dig in and pull apart this whole category, and really look at the whole landscape — find areas where we can provide clarity, find ways where we can do validation, find ways where we can test lift, find ways where we can write standards to give you the confidence to go and do this." MATT's aims to bring together the many providers to find a better way forward for clients were welcomed by Sanjay Gupta, EVP/marketing, innovation and corporate relations at insurer Allstate, one of the backers of the project. "The truth is we can all benefit from better tool sets," he said. "It still doesn't make it equal from a marketing standpoint, because what works for me may not work for my competitor. "So we will try to build edges, but I don't think too many marketers believe the tool set itself will give them an edge."

Thinkstock Advertisement While many efforts to boost women in business focus on meager numbers in the boardroom and executive suite, a new study shows female workers are at a disadvantage from the first rung of their career ladder. For every 100 women who get promoted from an entry-level position to manager, 130 men advance, according to the study released Tuesday by  LeanIn.org and McKinsey & Co. Women lag behind men at every step, but the gap is largest at the critical point when they first could move into leadership. “Women are hitting the glass ceiling earlier than people realize,” said Rachel Thomas, president of LeanIn, a group founded by Facebook Inc. Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. “Men are off to the races and women are starting to see hurdles right out of the gate.” The study looked at employee pipelines at 132 companies, including General Motors Co., Visa Inc., Procter & Gamble Co. and Morgan Stanley. It also surveyed 34,000 employees. Popular Now 12 Key Strategies to Achieving a Work-Life Balance Five Rules for Selecting the Best KPIs to Drive Operational Improvement Top 10 Manufacturing Countries in 2020 Women asked for promotions or raises slightly more frequently than men, and were more likely to be labeled “bossy” or “aggressive” when they did, the study found. Women also got less access to senior leaders than men, less advice on how to improve their work and fewer high-profile assignments. “Those things start to add up,” Thomas said. “Women progress more slowly, and the higher you look, the fewer women you see.” HR Nudge One reason may be that as they move up, many women shift from line roles, where they’re responsible for a profit-and-loss statement, to staff positions, such as human resources or information technology. Those jobs are less likely to lead to the CEO suite. It could be that women are nudged into those careers, Thomas said, or that they lack role models in line positions. Women make up less than 5% of the CEOs of the 500 largest U.S. public companies, according to Catalyst, an advocacy group for female executives. The disparities are most pronounced for women of color, who make up 20% of the U.S. population but just 3% of C-suite positions. While 78% of companies reported that gender diversity was a top 10 priority for their CEO, up from about 56% in 2012, only 55% said racial diversity was a high priority. But there is some cause for optimism, Thomas said. The study showed a slight increase in the percentage of women at each level compared with a year ago.  Another factor holding women back was partners who failed to share the burden of housework and child rearing, the study said. Among women who share housework equally with their partners, 43% aspired to senior executive jobs. Only 34% of those who did most of the housework wanted the same, the study said.

And you have the data to support this, right? Log In or Register to post comments Lone Star on Sep 28, 2016 This is a difficult topic and I applaud the studies and efforts to understand what is happening so all of us can grasp the challenge and work together to ensure everyone has a fair chance to compete. However, I have always struggled with the concept that complete and total equality between people regardless of gender or race actually exists. That notion excludes the fact that we all regardless of gender or race, have different strengths, weaknesses and motivations that manifest themselves as talent, faults, or availability. This fact of life consequently results in our how we define success and how we achieve success. With over 30 years in the corporate world, I have seen very capable women make a well thought out and deliberate decision not to move up the corporate ladder so that they could focus on raising their family. Likewise, I have met and worked with other women who have made the decision to compete and move into high level positions and have done extremely well. Bottom line is my experience tells me many (probably not all) companies truly have no glass ceiling and genuinely want more diversity at the top of their company. Unfortunately gender or race specific talent can be hard to find for reasons no statistical study based on demographics will ever explain.

The owners hope to open as soon as the April 3, the Cincinnati Reds' Opening Day, but no later than May 1. The 50,000-square-foot building at the corner of Mitchell and Spring Grove is the former P&G Mitchell Lab. Historically, the site was used to house trolley cars, according to Taft's Ale House head brewer and partner Kevin Moreland. His partners in both locations are Dave Kassling and Dave Williams. The owners said they're still working through final design plans for the site, which is located about 10 minutes north of the current location in Over-the-Rhine. But the project has the same designer as that original space, so  "there will definitely be similarities to the design of Taft's Ale House, while maintaining the industrial feel," Kassling said. "There's a total 'wow' factor when you walk into Taft's Ale House. We want to create a 'wow' factor that hasn't been seen at a production brewery." But don't expect the new site to be a carbon copy of the original, which opened on Opening Day 2015. "They will definitely be distinctly different experiences," Kassling said. That includes what will be on tap, as the Brewpourium may offer beers that aren't available in Over-the-Rhine. Also unlike at Taft's Ale House, where food is a major focus, Taft's Brewing Company doesn't have a kitchen on site. Kassling said they're still exploring options for how they might make food available to customers there. The owners declined to say exactly how much beer the new location will produce but said that it will allow the company to meet local demand and expand elsewhere in the region, things it currently can't do. Moreland said Taft's Ale House beer is already in about 170 locations in cans or on draft, but the production facility will allow them to grow that number as well as to can more beers. Which beer the new facility will produce first is still up in the air: The owners are letting Taft's Ale House visitors vote. Kassling and Moreland said the second location is all about long-term growth. "Assuming we're going to continue to grow and expand the way we want to, the space will be able to accommodate our growth for a long time coming," Kassling said. 759 CONNECTTWEET 4 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2dhzoph

(REUTERS/Marcelo del Pozo) Share Written by Oliver Staley September 27, 2016 It’s 2016 and opportunities for women in the workplace have improved, right? Think again. A new report from McKinsey & Co. and Lean In, the organization founded by Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg, shows that women are still struggling to advance. For every 100 women promoted past entry level positions, 130 men are promoted. Women are less likely to receive challenging assignments, participate in meetings and have access to senior leaders. And the pipeline of promotion shows women are being passed over at every stage (men and women are dropping out of the workplace at equal rates, so the numbers can’t be blamed on attrition): To compile its study, McKinsey used data from 132 US companies, representing 4.6 million workers at companies like Visa, General Motors and Proctor & Gamble. It also conducted a survey of 34,000 employees to get a more nuanced view of their experiences at work. The survey revealed that more women then men asked for a raise, 29% to 27%, but that in response, 30% of women were told that they were being “bossy,” “aggressive,” or “intimidating,” compared to 23% of men. Women also say they receive less feedback from managers than men. While 46% of men say they receive difficult feedback, only 36% of women do. Managers say the biggest reason they fail to give women feedback is a fear of being mean or hurtful. The results are even starker for women of color, who reported seeing fewer opportunities than white women across the board. There’s an increasing body of evidence that gender equity is achieved not by creating what appear to be gender neutral policies, but by companies actively working to make sure their procedures are free of bias and give women equal opportunities. Employers should rethink how they advertise positions, how they screen resumes and how they interview to ensure they’re free of unconscious bias, says Iris Bohnet, a behavioral economist at Harvard, in her book What Works. Notably, less than half of the companies McKinsey examined require diverse slates of candidates for hiring and promotion, and only 56% review job descriptions to ensure they’re free of biased language. One easy procedure to weed out biases in hiring is using blind resume reviews—removing names and other details from resumes that indicate gender and race—but only 4% of companies say they do that. If the study reveals how much work is left to be done to create gender equality in the workplace, the good news is that so much of that work is not complicated or difficult, and many firms are already doing it.

Reprints Reprints Most Popular The Mobile Marketing Association (MMA) has assembled a think tank backed by more than 20 major marketers to fix what may be marketing's biggest problem: figuring out what really drives media success or failure. Credit: Mobile Marketing Association The MMA Marketing Attribution Think Tank (MATT) will "rethink the world of marketing measurement and attribution," according to the group. It's backed by executives from Procter & Gamble Co., Unilever, Nestle, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola Co., J.P. Morgan Chase, American Express, Mastercard, Bank of America, Samsung, T-Mobile, Hilton, Choice Hotels and 1-800-Flowers, among others. The group planned to introduce the initiative during its SM2 Innovation Conference in New York on Tuesday. The first initiative of MATT focuses on "multi-touch attribution" (MTA)which seeks to sort through the many factors that contribute to purchase decisions rather than simply attributing them to the last thing consumers did or saw before buying something. Over the past six months, the MMA has conducted a comprehensive look into the providers and market dynamics in MTA in partnership with the Marketing Science Institute and Joel Rubinson, former Advertising Research Foundation chief research officer and now president of Rubinson Partners. The review found many brands don't use MTA because of difficulty evaluating offerings from vendors, giving the approach a negative 35 Net Promoter score that reflects a lack of confidence. In a breakfast outlining the initiative Tuesday morning, MMA CEO Greg Stuart said the Net Promoter score for Motel 6 was a relatively good minus 10, well ahead of the score for MTA firms. "So you'd really rather stay at Motel 6 than deal with multi-touch attribution?" he said, jokingly.

Many companies have pursued solutions on their own, he said. "But I think having the MMA bring multiple companies together to find the optimal way is extremely helpful." The project brings together numerous competitors, some of whom have traditionally felt they have a proprietary edge in analytics, to find industry solutions. "The truth is we can all benefit from better tool sets," Mr. Gupta said. "It still doesn't make it equal from a marketing standpoint, because what works for me may not work for my competitor. So we will try to build edges, but I don't think too many marketers believe the tool set itself will give them an edge." The effort is unlikely to quickly produce a single silver bullet to slay all the industry's analytics woes, Mr. Gupta said. "It's a complex problem, not one where six months later there will be an 'Aha!' moment. But it's much needed."

Hilary Says: Are Expensive Beauty Products Always Better? 01.09.2016 at 11:58 am By Hilary Rodriguez-Taiwo 8 Comments When it comes to cosmetics, expensive doesn’t always mean better. The truth is that there are good and bad products in all price categories. It’s all about the formulation not price. It’s quite interesting to find out which companies really own your favourite brands. It can also help you save money. For example, L’Oreal owns: Lancome YSL Beauty Body Shop Giorgio Armani Beauty Kiehls Urban Decay Garnier Maybelline NYX Estee Lauder owns: Bobbi Brown Clinique GlamGlow Jo Malone Crème De La Mer MAC Smash Box Tom Ford Beauty There are other global cosmetic companies that have so many cosmetics brands under their wings like Coty, Unilever, and Procter & Gamble etc. If you look at the ingredients list on products made by the same company, you’ll find that some cheaper brands use the same ingredients as the more expensive ones. Let’s have a look at Lancôme Advanced Genifique Youth Activating Serum and L’oreal Youth Code Serum Intense. It is quite common for L’Oreal and Lancôme to offer similar products whose only significant differences are price (L’Oreal owns Lancôme). Lancôme Advanced Genifique Youth Activating Serum 1.0 Oz/30ml – $78 “A powerful youth activating serum that reveals youthful radiance and smoother skin in just 7 days. Drop by drop, this potent serum boosts youthful radiance, restoring smoother, more radiant skin you can see and feel in just 7 days” Ingredients: Water, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Glycerin, Alcohol Denat., Dimethicone, Hydroxyethylpiperazine Ethane Sulfonic Acid, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Adenosine, Faex Extract/Yeast Extract/Extrait De Levure, Peg-20 Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate, Peg-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Salicyloyl Phytosphingosine, Ammonium Polyacryldimethyltauramide/Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium Edta, Octyldodecanol, Citronellol, Fragrance. L’Oreal Youth Code Serum Intense 1.0 Oz/30ml – $25 “Restore fresh glow. Boost Hydration. Rapidly diminish first lines…..Skin looks rested, smoother and youthfully luminous” Ingredients: Water, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Glycerin, Alcohol Denat, Dimethicone, Hydroxyethylpiperazine Ethane Sulfonic Acid, PEG-20 Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Salicyloyl Phytosphingosine, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Adenosine, Ammonium Polyacryldimethyltauramide / Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Disodium Edta, Caprylyl Glycol, Citric Acid, Xanthan Gum, N-Hydroxysuccinimide, Chrysin, Octyldodecanol, Sodium Benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Limonene, Fragrance Both serums have these ingredients in common: Water, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Glycerin, Alcohol Denat., Dimethicone, Hydroxyethylpiperazine Ethane Sulfonic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, PEG-20 Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate, Adenosine, Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Benzoate, Disodium Edta, Citric Acid, Octyldodecanol, Fragrance. The most important ingredients in both serums are exactly the same. So both serums will do pretty much the same thing. The important ingredients are: Bifida Ferment Lysate, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate and Dimethicone. The rest of the formula is mostly preservatives, stabilizers, and fragrance. Let’s talk about these ingredients. Bifida Ferment Lysate It is a type of gram-positive bacteria found in the digestive system. According to L’Oreal, it can repair DNA, improve the skin’s barrier function and hydration but there is no research to prove that it has any anti-aging or gene-stimulating effect when applied on the skin. Glycerin & Sodium Hyaluronate They are both humectants. Humectants draw water from the environment into the skin to keep it hydrated. Dimethicone This is a silicone emollient, which can make fine lines, and wrinkles look smaller by filling them in. These results are only temporary, once the serum comes off, the wrinkles will still be there. Most anti-aging serums have dimethicone in them. In Conclusion Lancome Genifique costs three times as much as L’Oreal Youth Code but they will do exactly the same thing. Both serums can temporarily reduce the appearance of fine lines/wrinkles but they will not eliminate them. It’s quite odd that they have alcohol in both serums at high percentages, as alcohol is known to be drying, irritating and cause free-radical damage. If you have dry and sensitive skin, I wont advice you to use any of these products. The truth is that cosmetics companies want you to believe that they have the answer to fine lines and wrinkles. “Just put this cream on and the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles will be visibly reduced!” Technically – that statement is true. However, the message that consumers get from this claim is different than the words that are written and marketers know this. If you moisturize your skin, the fine lines and wrinkles will plump up and they will appear to fill in. Also, thanks to brightening pigments or silicones that smooth out the surface of the skin so that it reflects light better, these products can really reduce the appearance of wrinkles. Appearance is the key word here. The claim simply means that the product makes wrinkles look less obvious, not that it gets rid of them. It also means if you use this product (and continue to use it) your wrinkles will look better.  Unfortunately there is no lotion, serum, cream, or oil that can reverse the effects of age and gravity on our bodies.

The Real Oma September 1, 2016 at 12:43 pm I can tell you for a fact that expensive is not always better. I have used some pricey products on my brown skin and i have also used very cheap ones, and what i have learnt is that only 4 things matter most to my skin – exfoliation (a firm sponge/loofah is enough), a moisturizer with enough oil (i add a bit of bio oil and olive oil, just recently started adding coconut oil, so soon to ditch the bio oil), drinking a lot of water, and eating healthy. My current moisturizer is St Ives Mineral Therapy and i bought it last for 2100, before the recession it was 1,300, and it even retailed for 950 when i started with it. And i have really good skin, in fact, just this morning i got two compliments on its radiance. So, no, expensive does not mean better – genes, nutrition and general skin care, are the more important points. Signed, Oma with the good skin :)) Love this! 19 Reply Anon September 1, 2016 at 4:03 pm Buying expensive beauty products is like buying designer apparel. You are really buying the name. Expensive beauty products contain the most carcinogenic substances and are not good for sensitive skin. Even the ones that state they are good for sensitive skin are not good for spot prone skin. Quite a few of them contain micro beads and there’s a recent ban on micro beads. Some of them contain egg shells, ostrich shells and some other shells which some people find irritable (they cause break outs.). It’s best not to trip over them. Love this! 15 Reply Dr Ebele Ugochukwu September 1, 2016 at 9:06 pm very interesting article; a topic I had been considering doing myself. when I was formulating my skin care range, I was on a tour of factories in Taiwan; I noticed that the production lines were the same for most companies and it is only twds the end that they diverge into different lines for the final packaging and sealing. I was shocked to learn that most of products of these cosmetic companies we patronize all come from the same factory and sometimes with the same formulations only different packaging. when I thought about it, I realized it actually made sense, two different companies with products containing shear butter will use the same shear butter only possibly in different quantities. most formulations are similar so its just a matter of finding one that suits you and it will not necessarily be the expensive one; you are always paying for the brand name when buying expensive things; as a consummate shopaholic, I long since realized this. @the real Oma, I was proud to read your post, you really know what you are talking about. exfoliation is very key for good skin so also is drinking a lot of water. Check out my skin care line S.Studio skin care. its very well formulated and very affordable; wont cost more than what your are paying now, I promise you it will take your skin game to the next level. Love this! 9 Reply Sarah September 2, 2016 at 6:22 am Wow. You own Sleek Studio. Awesome. Love this! 7 Reply seyi September 1, 2016 at 11:04 pm Thank you for this informative and depressing article. Loolz Love this! 8 Reply Heav September 8, 2016 at 1:51 pm Nice and informative article. Can you recommend a good anti wrinkle preventive cream for me? I live in the uk. I know I can’t stop the inevitable but I will like to slow or control it. Am just 30 but age is telling on my face. Love this! 4 Reply Hilary Rodriguez-Taiwo September 10, 2016 at 11:50 am Hi Heav, one thing i always tell people is that your skin grows from the inside out. There’s not alot you can do from the outside in. Drink loads of water, eat foods with antioxidants (there are so many, check online), cut down your sugar intake, exercise too. Free radicals are one of the things that damage and wrinkle our skin, they are everywhere so antioxidants will help fight them. Keeping the skin hydrated is very important, it helps the skin function the way it should and makes it look plump so wrinkles are less visible. You can get a serum with retinol or a good humectant like Hyaluronic Acid. The serum i use is the Radha Beauty Vitamin C serum, it also has Vitamin E and Hyaluronic Acid, i combine it with the Radha Beauty Retinol Moisturizer; it works for me. Love this! 3 Reply Heav September 26, 2016 at 3:42 pm Tnanks. Apologies for the late reply.

This creates a strong stimulus among market traders and investors to either sell or buy (acquire of offload) their stock/s, which result in heavier trading volume, and usually strong momentum for the stock as well.

How Chase Made the Perfect High for Credit Card Junkies Bloomberg 9/26/2016 Sam Grobart @samgrobart Click to expand Replay Video New figures show bad news for Wells Fargo Embattled bank Wells Fargo announced this week that new account openings fell by 44 percent in the month October and new credit card applications have fallen by over 50 percent. New figures released show that foot traffic to branches is also down, with "branch banker interactions" down 22 percent from 2015. The figures come in the wake of a sales practice scandal that triggered multiple lawsuits, an enormous $185 million fine and the resignation of the company's longtime CEO John Stumpf.

One of the buildings in that park is basically windowless; you might mistake it for a warehouse or, if you were feeling exotic, a data center. The only thing that’s remarkable about the structure, signaling there’s something of great value inside, is an imposing floor-to-ceiling metal turnstile in a guarded vestibule. This building is a modern-day mint. It’s where JPMorgan Chase, the largest issuer of credit cards in the U.S., manufactures around 60 percent of the 95 million cards it issues each year. The company requires visitors to keep its exact location secret. For more than 15 years, the facility has hummed along, embossing numbers onto plastic cards and stuffing them into envelopes. During that time, only three things have really disrupted BAU, Chase-ese for “business as usual”: the Target data breach of 2014, which required the factory to quickly reissue millions of cards; the industrywide 2015 switch from magnetic-stripe cards to ones that include microchips; and in August the frenzied demand for the company’s newest offering—the Chase Sapphire Reserve. Ned Lindsey, Chase’s managing director of customer fulfillment, runs the Ohio plant and a sister facility in Texas. On Aug. 24, Lindsey noticed something strange—card requests were coming in at an extremely high rate, all for the Reserve. “We were seeing demand that was eight- to tenfold more than what we expected,” he says. Lindsey, it seems, doesn’t read credit card blogs. Since July, a fever had been building on social media among points-and-miles obsessives aware that Chase was preparing a premium card—one that would sit above its already-popular Sapphire Preferred, and offer rewards to match. Almost a month before Chase introduced Reserve, the community discovered the card’s perks through some leaked information: a sign-up bonus of 100,000 points, triple points on travel and dining, airport lounge memberships, and credits that offset a $450 annual fee, among other goodies. Of course, like its Sapphire Preferred brethren, the card would have a weighty metal core that creates what is known in the trade as “plunk factor.” © Finlay MacKay for Bloomberg Businessweek Plasticheads got the vapors. “When I first heard the details,” wrote Brian Kelly, aka The Points Guy, probably the most influential card blogger, “I had to sit down, because it sounded way too good to be true.” The Sapphire Reserve, wrote another, Ben Schlappig, is “beyond a no-brainer, possibly the most compelling card we’ve ever seen.” On Reddit, a user shared that Chase had accidentally published a Reserve application link, and thousands of applications poured in before the page was deactivated. By the official launch date of Aug. 23, anticipation had built to the point that the Chase site was bumrushed by a horde of deal-seekers. In Ohio, Lindsey brought in extra staff and added shifts. “We had to have a backup plan to the backup plan,” he says. The plant ran hot for about three weeks. During that time, Chase burned through its inventory of metal cards—a stock that was supposed to last 10 to 12 months. (The company declined to say how many Preferred or Reserve cards it’s issued.) To continue to sate the appetite for the Sapphire Reserve, Chase had to switch to standard plastic cards as placeholders. The bank says it’s now sent out as many plastic cards as metal—two years’ worth of cards, gone in less than a month. When the first cards were shipped, some customers posted “unboxing” videos on YouTube, reverently exhibiting terms-and-conditions pamphlets to the camera. The videos have garnered more than 60,000 views; the Reddit thread has 10,000 comments. The hype usually reserved for a new iPhone was now being applied to a high-interest line of credit. And until mid-September, Chase hadn’t spent a dime on advertising. Chase is not the first issuer to offer a big-annual-fee-but-mucho-points card. American Express and Citibank have been playing in that part of the market for years. But Chase has entered at the right time—when a growing community of enthusiasts will do the company’s marketing online for free—and with the right card, one that assiduously checks every box the modern credit card deal-hunter cares about. None of this happened by accident. The process to create new credit cards is little different from the research Procter & Gamble does to develop a new laundry detergent or Honda does to develop a new crossover SUV. A credit card is a means of payment and the extension of a loan, but it’s also a collection of perks and points that confer experiences and status upon its user, as well as an object people typically touch several times a day. In a country with more than half a billion credit cards already in circulation, it’s not a given that any new combination of attributes will work. Chase had already learned a thing or two about how to make a card more than a card. The Sapphire Preferred, introduced in 2009 with a $95 annual fee, was the reigning “It card” before Reserve came along. One especially devoted cardholder is Bryan Denman, a 35-year-old New York creative director, who has taken advantage of Preferred’s perks to treat his girlfriend to Chase-sponsored private dinners at the restaurants Craft, Rebelle, and Le Bernardin, as well as to get good seats at venues like Madison Square Garden. Denman recognizes that loyalty to a credit card is unusual. “Everyone’s brought up to distrust their credit card company,” he says. “You don’t want to be on the phone with them; why would you want to spend the night with them?” But his experiences with Chase have conferred upon Denman the zeal of a convert. “I am a complete fanboy,” he says. “I’m telling everyone to get this card.” He’s not alone. “When I go to dinner, there might be three cards that get thrown down. They’re all Chase Sapphire.” At Chase, finding the Bryan Denmans of the marketplace is a task led by Gordon Smith. When he’s not restoring classic sports cars—like a 1969 Jaguar E-Type from England, where he grew up—he’s in charge of the company’s card and consumer-banking divisions. Having previously headed up the U.S. card business for American Express, Smith joined Chase in 2007. When he got there, he saw that the bank’s card business was little more than a consumer-finance operation. In that context, he says, “a customer doesn’t think about themselves really as having the credit card. They think about themselves as having the loan.” This wasn’t where Smith wanted his credit card division to be. A card that people think of as only a loan is not a card customers have a relationship with, much less a card they want to use all the time. “They could keep the card itself in a shoebox, not necessarily in their wallet,” says Smith. At the same time, the marketplace was going through an upheaval. The financial crisis led banks to step back from offering plastic to anyone with a pulse, and many Americans drastically cut their credit card bills. The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act of 2009 placed numerous restrictions on how issuers could penalize or otherwise dun their members for exorbitant fees, erasing billions from the low end of the market. Cards for more affluent consumers were a safer bet. The right kind of card in this environment would have to be, as they say in the credit card industry, “top of wallet”—something you use frequently as your preferred method of payment. The reason has to do with the fact that card issuers can make money in two ways: interest and fees or interchange. The recession and the CARD Act made the interest-and-fees strategy a much harder proposition. “It was clear that revolving-credit cards were not going to be the moneymaker they once were,” says David Robertson, the publisher of the Nilson Report, an industry newsletter. Interchange became the way to go. Someone who uses his card all day, every day, for everything from a cup of Starbucks to a new Rolex Submariner, is allowing his issuer to collect a small fee on every transaction. That fee—the interchange—is higher for premium cards such as Chase’s Sapphires. The fee is higher still when the card is used at a luxury retailer, which is more likely with a high-end card. And since the fee is something charged to the merchant, not the shopper, it saves banks from incurring more consumer wrath. For all these reasons, Chase decided to pursue a premium strategy. But a premium credit card would have to be something different in 2009 than when they first came about in the 1980s and ’90s. That market was effectively established and defined by American Express, which had launched cards like the Platinum in 1984 and the black Centurion card in 1999. Its top-shelf cards came with hefty annual fees ($450 and $2,500, respectively) but also a complement of perks and services that, it was suggested, could almost change the laws of nature to meet your needs. Dedicated concierges could secure last-minute reservations at popular restaurants; Centurion cardholders could be greeted at international airports and whisked through customs and immigration. In the throes of the Great Recession, Chase judged that luxury would have to be cloaked in understated virtue, not sybaritic excess. The modern affluent customer was more Joni Mitchell than Joan Collins: more casual, more discreet—millionaires with minivans. To attract that kind of customer, a new credit card would have to offer a sense of being a sound financial choice. One way for Chase to do that would be to lower the annual fee from hundreds of dollars to $95. “When you look at where you’re going to price something, on a per-unit basis it can be very profitable obviously with a high price, but you’re going to find a much smaller group of people who will find the product attractive,” says Chase’s Smith. “How do we price it in such a way that it would be economically viable for us, but the customer will look at it and say, ‘You know what? I have to pay a fee, but that’s good value.’ "That value can also be emphasized by a robust rewards program. The dirty little open secret of those older elite cards was that, for all their swagger and status, they were actually pretty lousy at rewarding their users. “With the American Express Platinum, you get one point per dollar on all purchases other than travel purchases from American Express’s travel agent,” says Jason Steele, a writer for CompareCards.com. “Yet with less expensive annual fees, there are cards that could get two times or three times for every dollar you spend.” Keeping track of miles and points used to be the domain of road-warrior obsessives, who could debate the relative merits of rewards programs with Talmudic specificity, but collecting and using rewards has gotten decidedly more mainstream. Credit card review sites—many of which earn commissions on driving leads to issuers’ websites—act like an accelerant when a new card catches fire. They rank high in Google searches and dominate discussion boards. ThePointsGuy, the site Kelly runs, now has close to 3 million unique visitors every month, which makes it about as heavily trafficked as Bleacher Report, the popular sports site. Many points-granting cards rely on a complex system of rotating bonus categories. The Citi Dividend card, for example, gives 5 percent cash back on Hilton hotel rooms and car rentals in the current quarter; in October, the offer shifts to Best Buy and department store purchases. With Sapphire, Chase opted for simplicity. “What these customers tell us,” says Pam Codispoti, the president of Chase’s branded cards division, “is that rewards matter, but while we want them to be very valuable, we actually don’t want to do a whole lot of work to understand the rules and regulations around them.” Chase introduced the Sapphire Preferred card in 2009 with double points in two large categories: dining and travel. The card also allowed users to transfer their points to a broad range of frequent-flier programs (at the cost of undercutting its existing range of co-branded cards with United Airlines). The moderate fee, generous points, and partner network got the Sapphire Preferred noticed, and as consumer spending began to rebound after the recession, it came to be regularly cited on card-enthusiast sites as one of the all-around best. Chase’s emphasis on value dovetails with the psychology of what the company refers to as the “new affluent”: a segment of the population that is well-to-do but still in its prime earning years. For them, it’s more important to be savvy than fancy. More Kirkland vodka from Costco, less Stolichnaya Elit. “You feel smart with this card,” says Kelly, describing the image of the first Sapphire card. “You’re ‘in the know.’ You’re not flashy.” The design of Chase’s Sapphire Preferred card, which has now been extended to the Reserve, has been a surprisingly powerful asset. Sapphire cards are nearly featureless on the front, with little more than a chip, the cardholder’s name, and some discreet branding. The numbers are flush on the back, but what always gets remarked upon is the card’s weight. With a metal core sandwiched between two pieces of plastic, the Sapphire Preferred has noticeably more heft than a regular, all-plastic card. Chase won’t say what materials are used, but Lindsey, the plant director, says the form factor costs “5 to 10 times as much as a standard card”; chip-enabled cards cost around $2 to make. “I have the Chase Sapphire Preferred, and virtually nothing gives me more pleasure when I pay and the cashier notices how gorgeous that card is,” says Sean McQuay, the credit card expert at NerdWallet, a personal-finance site. (He has since gotten a Reserve; “the sign-up bonus was too good to ignore,” he says.) “Chase has basically realized that the weight raises customers’ dopamine levels. Being able to get into my brain every single time I swipe my card—there’s literally nothing better a marketer could want.” Chase’s neurotransmitter strategy has had a positive effect on its bottom line: In 2007, the bank’s card-services division reported net income of $2.9 billion; in 2015, that figure was $3.9 billion. As the Sapphire Preferred became a success, Smith assembled new teams at Chase to determine what kind of card would appeal to an even wealthier slice of consumers. The market seemed ready: Both Citi and Amex had cut some perks from their high-end cards, such as airport-lounge access and free rounds of golf, disappointing some cardholders. Perhaps they’d be interested in a new card? From the beginning, though, it was clear that the new, upmarket card would share the Sapphire name, which was a new step for the company. “What Chase had done largely before is come out with completely new names” for new cards, says Smith. “So all that brand equity that you built up was effectively gone.” With Sapphire, Smith is trying to develop a platform. Always the car enthusiast, he thinks of Sapphire Preferred as Chase’s BMW 3 Series, and the Sapphire Reserve as the larger, more luxurious 5 Series. “We wanted Sapphire to stand for the things that it always stood for but give us the space to keep growing and evolving it,” he says, “so that the brand name of Sapphire would still resonate with customers and stay relevant.” Smith knows enough about cars to know that above the BMW 3 Series and 5 Series is the flagship 7 Series. While Chase hasn’t said whether it intends to move even further upmarket, it would not be at all surprising if the bank followed Sapphire Preferred and Reserve with, say, Sapphire Premier. That would be a pure play to the affluent, no “mass” required. Already, competitors such as Barclays have launched new cards like the Gold Luxury Card, which comes with a $1,000 annual fee but is actually less rewarding than the Sapphire Reserve. At the top of the heap is American Express’s Centurion, which commands exorbitant fees ($7,500 as an initiation fee, followed by a $2,500 annual fee) for those lucky enough to be invited to join. If Reserve sustains its momentum, a move into more rarefied incomes may be next. “I think a number of issuers think that Amex is ready to be run down,” says the Nilson Report’s Robertson. Fortunately for Chase, it’s getting new cardholders while they’re young—to a surprising degree. When it was originally conceived, Reserve was expected to attract a slightly older customer, but Chase says the majority of applicants have been millennials. Kelly thinks Sapphire has transcended the surly bonds of personal finance. “They’ve built a lifestyle brand out of it,” he says. Perhaps that’s Chase’s greatest accomplishment: It has managed to make Sapphire a modern, desirable credit card for people who would otherwise not care about their credit card. “They’ve managed to take something from being a stupid card you carry in your wallet,” says Denman, “to a part of your identity, like the clothes you wear.” —With Ben Steverman Go to MSN Home More in Money The most dangerous states in America 24/7 Wall St. 15 of the biggest business disasters of all time Lovemoney 12 leaders who took $1 salaries Money What Trump's win could mean for older Americans CBS News 30 things you should never buy without a coupon GOBankingRates 6 brand mascots that actually existed in real life Business Insider AdChoices AdChoices Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

Story Continued Below Monday’s first presidential debate hit a lot of the key tax issues in this year’s campaign, from GOP nominee Donald Trump hitting Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for raising taxes, Clinton hitting back that Trump’s relying on tired trickle-down philosophies — and, of course, that moment when Trump appeared to suggest that he doesn’t really pay income taxes. The Pro teams fact-checked a number of tax issues, but let’s start with those tax returns. After the debate, Trump told CNN that he wasn’t suggesting during the debate that he didn’t pay the Treasury. “I didn’t say that at all,” Trump said. “I do hate the way our government spends money.” (POLITICO's Sarah Wheaton goes into why people might have gotten that impression.) But then there's this: Hope Hicks, a Trump spokeswoman, told The Wall Street Journal that Trump was only referring to the years that it's already been confirmed that he didn't pay any income tax. As for actual tax policy, there were questions about how much money U.S. companies hold offshore (Trump overstated it), among other things. But big picture: Trump plugged his tax cuts, while Clinton was proudly behind her tax hikes on the rich. And that’s really not all that different from 2012, when President Barack Obama openly campaigned on tax hikes for the wealthy. That year’s GOP nominee, Mitt Romney, was calling for revenue-neutral tax reform, though there were questions about whether his plan could actually pull that off. SERIOUSLY, IT’S ONLY TUESDAY. It’s also been 426 years since Pope Urban VII died. The good news was he got to be pope. The bad news was he was only pope for less than two weeks before dying, the shortest tenure of all time. What’s going on out there? Email: bbecker@politico.com, teckert@politico.com, bfaler@politico.com, kodonnell@politico.com. Twitter: @berniebecker3, @tobyeckert, @brian_faler, @katyodonnell_ , @POLITICOPro and @Morning_Tax. CATS AND DOGS, DANCING TOGETHER: The liberal Citizens for Tax Justice released its own projections for Trump’s new tax plan on Monday, finding that 44 percent of the tax cuts would go to the top 1 percent and that the plan would cost anywhere from $4.8 trillion to $6.4 trillion over a decade. Bob McIntyre of CTJ said the price tag on the newest Trump plan might be trimmed, but it’s still “in the same spirit” as the original, $10 trillion-over-a-decade proposal. Interestingly enough, the conservative Tax Foundation came to similar conclusions (as pointed out by their own staffers) — at least when it came their score that didn’t try to account for economic growth. TRUMP AND CHILD CARE, CONT’D: Well, that paper asserting that Trump’s plan would hike taxes on families consisting of around 25 million parents and 15 million children — under a conservative estimate — certainly gained some more traction on Monday. Trump’s team has ridiculed the paper from Lily Batchelder of New York University, a former Democratic tax aide in both the Senate and the White House. But the Tax Foundation’s Kyle Pomerleau also said on Twitter on Monday that — following some back-of-the-envelope calculations — Batchelder’s conclusions looked reasonable. (The Trump campaign certainly has not been shy in plugging the Foundation’s findings on other parts of its tax plan.) And Harry Stein of the Center for American Progress digs down a little deeper on the numbers, noting the Trump camp’s own examples of how his plan would give a $93 tax cut to certain married couples with two children making $50,000 a year and a $1,083 tax cut to a married couple with two children making $75,000 a year. A single parent under similar circumstances, Stein maintains, would see a $340 tax increase when making $50,000 a year and a $1,140 tax increase at $75,000 in annual income. SCORE ONE FOR SCHUMER AND GRASSLEY: The IRS officially announced that four private debt collectors — two in New York and one apiece in California and Iowa — will start seeking certain overdue tax debts in spring 2017, as our Toby Eckert reports. Perhaps not surprisingly, Sens. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) are big fans of the use of the debt collectors, which was inserted into last year’s highway bill. The IRS’s union, the national taxpayer advocate and other Democratic lawmakers are among the opponents of the change, noting that previous attempts to use private companies has turned out to be a money loser for the government. But Toby also notes there’s a particular concern about private debt collectors that the IRS didn’t have to worry about as much the last time — identity theft. The agency said Monday it would send multiple notices to taxpayers who are having their cases turned over to a collection agency, after warning for years against phone scams that can lead to return fraud. INTERESTING: Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey, a Democratic tax writer, is planning to introduce legislation that would be similar to the House GOP’s plan to tax imports, but not exports, according to Tax Analysts’ Dylan Moroses. Getting Democrats to buy in to key parts of their tax plan could be a boon to the GOP, especially as top lawmakers insist they’ll push for a tax reform vote in 2017. That said — one Democratic bill does not a movement make. FIRST LOOK: The lobbying over the Treasury Department’s earnings stripping regulations has migrated to the states as well. Dozens of Ohio companies and business groups — including Procter & Gamble, based in Cincinnati, and the discount retail chain Big Lots, headquartered in Columbus — are sending Treasury Secretary Jack Lew a letter today that says the proposed Section 385 rules are already hurting business in the Buckeye State. “The proposed regulations will complicate, and in some cases eliminate, our companies’ ability to self-finance our job growth and could obstruct access to capital,” the businesses and groups wrote. “The broad language of the regulations creates uncertainty resulting in serious hesitation to make long-term commitments in an already challenging business environment.” Rep. Pat Tiberi of Ohio, a senior Republican at House Ways and Means, piled on, too. “At some point, the administration will need to start listening to these substantial and serious concerns from businesses in my state and across the country,” he said. FIRST LOOK, PART DEUX: The Alliance for Competitive Taxation, one of several corporate coalitions pushing for tax reform, is piggybacking on last night's debate to stress the need to bring down both the effective and statutory corporate tax rate. The group cites a PricewaterhouseCoopers study that found that the effective tax rate here “was between 26 percent and 114 percent higher than the average for the comparison countries.” WE GOT 51! The Brewers Association announced Monday that it’s got a majority of the Senate behind the Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act, as Pro Agriculture’s Catherine Boudreau reports. A majority of both chambers has now signed on to the measure, which would cut the excise tax on beer for smaller brewers, with the support in the Senate especially bipartisan — 26 Republicans and 25 Democrats. That includes a couple of former Senate Finance chairmen (Grassley and Ron Wyden) and the Senate Democrats’ next leader (Schumer). But as supporters of other measures can tell the craft brewers, having most of Congress with you doesn’t mean that your bill is going to get passed quickly. DRIP, DRIP, DRIP: The Washington Post’s David Fahrenthold is out with a new scoop on the Trump Foundation — apparently, the GOP nominee directed that at least $2.3 million worth of payments owed to him instead go to his foundation. That’s all well and fine, but Trump would still likely owe taxes on that money. His campaign told the Post that Trump paid taxes on a $400,000 portion of the $2.3 million, but declined comment on the rest. INTERNATIONAL UPDATE — UP CREEK, NO PADDLE: Apple’s not exactly lacking for money, yet still has a rather shoestring operation when it comes to lobbying in Europe — something The Wall Street Journal reports didn’t help the tech titan fend off that record $14.6 billion fine and won’t help with any appeal. Apple, the Journal notes, spent just around $1 million (900,000 euros) on lobbying the European Union last year, and has no full-time lobbyists on the continent. (That’s about a quarter of what companies like Google and Microsoft spent.) And here’s the upshot about how that might have influenced the European Commission’s decision that Apple’s tax agreements with Ireland constituted illegal state aid: “Apple was unsuccessful in gathering information over the last two years from the commission about the evolving theory the EU was resting its case on, said people familiar with the matter.” Related: Pascal Saint-Amans, who led the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Initiative, said Apple won’t necessarily be a precedent in Europe. FIGURING OUT FATCA: One of President Barack Obama’s signature achievements on battling tax evasion — the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act — has some holes that have left the financial sector worried with just months left in Obama’s tenure, Bloomberg BNA reports. The issue: More than 100 governments have signed pacts with the federal government, known as intergovernmental agreements (IGAs), that facilitate the sharing of information on Americans’ bank accounts with the IRS. But 49 countries haven’t finalized their agreements yet. Those pacts have either been signed or are being treated as in effect, but banks are still worried about moving forward with so many IGAs short of completely done. “A lot of financial institutions are nervous about what they'll do if countries get dropped off the list of IGAs,” said one expert. “They're exploring what they can do in a worst-case scenario.” STATE NEWS — ABOUT THAT TOBACCO TAX: This much is very clear about the upcoming California budget measure on tobacco — it would increase the price of a pack of cigarettes by $2, and tax e-cigarettes, as Kaiser Health News notes. What’s not so clear: Where will that money go? “It is estimated that up to $1 billion each year would go to ‘improved payments’ for Medi-Cal health care services — which proponents say will be parsed out democratically. But opponents say the health care funding is part of a ‘special interest tax grab.’” QUICK LINKS — Mylan understated its pretax EpiPen profits. — Treasury Secretary Jack Lew offers some tax exchange help to Argentina.

But it’s typically not accepted in North American recycling programs, which means that flexible packaging usually ends up in landfills. Considering the market for food and beverage flexible packaging is expected to exceed $83 billion by 2020, that’s a lot of plastic waste. New research from Resource Recycling Systems (RSS), however, shows flexible packaging can be captured in single-stream materials recovery facilities (MRF) with automated sorting technologies in use today. This could create a new stream of recovered materials while improving the quality of other recycling streams. The research was commissioned by Materials Recovery for the Future (MRFF), a collaborative of brand owners, manufacturers and packaging industry organizations that want to improve recycling and increase recovery rates for flexible film and packaging options. MRFF members include Amcor, Dow Chemical, LyondellBasell, Nestlé Purina PetCare and Nestlé USA, PepsiCo, Plum Organics, Procter & Gamble, SC Johnson, Sealed Air and Target as well as the Association for Postconsumer Plastic Recyclers, the Flexible Packaging Association, SPI: The Plastics Industry Trade Association and the American Chemistry Council. “Flexible packaging has many positive attributes — highly efficient, great product protection, and low environmental impact. However, recovery has been one of its weak points,” said Brad Rodgers, foods packaging research and development director for discovery and sustainability at PepsiCo, in a statement. “This study is shedding light on pathways that can be deployed to improve flexible packaging end-of-life options.” This first phase of the MRFF research program included baseline testing, equipment testing, and a series of recovery facility trials to test existing sortation technologies commonly used in MRFs, such as screens and optical scanners. RRS developed the test methodology and conducted the research trials. Subsequent research will focus on further refinements to sorting technology, economic feasibility, assessing end-use markets for the material, and developing a recovery facility demonstration project. The research follows MRFF member Dow’s launch of a new RecycleReady Technology that allows polyethylene-based barrier packaging to be recycled as part of existing grocery store drop-off recycling programs.

Just about every year at this time, I offer ratings — buy, neutral or sell — on the largest U.S. stocks. These giants aren't my meat and potatoes. My real sweet spot is in small- and mid-cap stocks. But I rate the behemoths because I know a lot of readers are interested; these stocks are widely owned. Apple Inc. (AAPL, $607 billion) is the largest U.S. stock by a mile. The company is highly profitable and has a mountain of cash. But the iPhone, its flagship product, may be slowing a little. Avoid. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT, $448 billion) is still a great company, but growth and profitability aren't as impressive as in the glory days. I recommended it in 2010-2013, but now I think its price is too high. Avoid. Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN, $382 billion) is a stock about which I've been consistently skeptical. I've been wrong, as sales and the stock price have soared. But all my experience tells me that paying 200 times earnings for a stock is insane. Avoid. Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM, $346 billion) is king of the energy business, which has been a troubled realm since mid-2014. The troubles aren't over, but I think the tide is slowly turning. Buy. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ, $325 billion) is a broadly diversified health-care company with a business model I admire. It's not especially popular with Wall Street's analysts today, but its profit margin has been expanding. Buy. Facebook Inc. (FB, $297 billion), one of the four popular “FANG” stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google), boasts rapid earnings growth as ad sales improve. It's popular with analysts, but I dislike it at 61 times recent earnings. Avoid. Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, $270 billion) is the proud parent of Google. I admire its innovations, its talent pool and its acquisitions. But valuations (31 times recent earnings, almost 7 times sales) keep me on the sidelines. Neutral. General Electric Co. (GE, $268 billion) has been reemphasizing its industrial roots. A year ago, I said I wanted to see how this strategy played out for the next 12 months. Results are mixed, so I want to wait longer. Neutral. AT&T Inc. (T, $254 billion) sports a 4.6 percent dividend yield. I like it for income-oriented investor. Buy. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) has shown only mediocre growth and profitability of late, but I have faith in the ability of CEO Jamie Diamond. Buy. Procter & Gamble Co. (PG, $234 billion) is a household word, but its 10-year revenue and earnings growth rates are near 1 percent. People are paying 24 times earnings for a stock that's solid but not growing much. Avoid. Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC, $231 billion) has the same problem all banks have. It's hard to earn a good spread on lending when interest rates are low. I think things will improve, but slowly. Neutral. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT, $224 billion) remains a leader in low-price retailing, but competitors have copied many of its innovations such as detailed computerized tracking of sales and inventory. Avoid. Verizon Communications (VZ, $214 billion) made a good move in my opinion by buying Internet portals AOL and Yahoo. However, I view it as inferior to AT&T in labor relations and balance-sheet strength. Avoid. Pfizer Inc. (PFE, $208 billion) is a stock I own for my more conservative clients, but I am getting nervous as the price has climbed to 30 times earnings. Neutral. Chevron Corp. (CVX, $187 billion) should gradually strengthen with the energy industry, like its big brother Exxon Mobil. I believe it is doing a better job in exploration than most. Buy. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B, $186 billion) looks like a bargain to me at 14 times earnings. It's run by investment genius Warren Buffett. No one can replace him, but he's clearly been working hard on succession planning.Buy. Coca-Cola Co. (KO, $184 billion) continues to show high profitability but little growth. People are starting to cut back on soda, and profit margins aren't as high on most other beverages. Avoid. Intel Corp. (INTC, $176 billion), the largest player in semiconductor chips for personal computers, has suffered as people move to smartphones and away from PCs. I think the stock will be a buy sometime, but not yet. Avoid. Merck & Co., like Pfizer, is a stock I've often owned for clients. But at present, with the stock at 35 times earnings, my enthusiasm is weak. Neutral. Past Results This is the 13th column I've written rating the biggest stocks. Overall, results for the first 12 columns have been respectable. My Buys returned an average of 12 percent in 12 months, my Neutrals 11.3 percent and my Avoids 9.3 percent. Last year, however, I had enough egg on my face to make a king-sized omelet. Led by Amazon.com, the stocks I said to avoid scored a 24.7 percent return, while my Buy-rated stocks managed only 4.8 percent.

By Julie Edgar Sept. 26, 2016 -- Krista Calderon first bought Wen hair products more than a year ago, believing that using something billed as “natural” would be better for her hair. At first, she noticed that her eyebrows lost their shape and figured that the person who waxed them had messed up. Then she noticed that her leg hair was patchy. Five months into using two of Wen’s cleansing conditioners, she called the company to ask why she seemed to be losing hair. She was told she wasn’t using the products properly. By December -- 8 months after she started using them -- she saw that the part in her hair was widening. Around the same time, Calderon read an article on her Facebook page about complaints against Wen and “put two and two together,” she says. The experience left her with crippling anxiety. “I didn’t want to go out from January 2016 until recently. I really became a recluse,” says Calderon, 26, who lives in Southern California. She estimates that from April to December 2015, she spent $300 on the Wen products, which are often advertised in late-night infomercials and in online ads. The cleansing conditioners sell for about $25 and up. She’s since thrown them out, slowly regaining her emotional footing along with her hair. Calderon is among tens of thousands of Wen by Chaz Dean Cleansing Conditioner users who had a similar experience. The company, based in Santa Monica, CA, has received more than 21,000 complaints about the products. But spokesman Joe Hixson denies they are the cause of the hair loss, breakage, and scalp irritation described by users. The company has proposed paying $26.2 million to settle a class-action lawsuit against it. Hixon says the settlement is not an admission of guilt. It would pay out about $25 apiece to most of the plaintiffs, he says. It would also require the company to include a caution on the label. Wen continues selling the conditioner and its other products, highlighting what some say is a lack of federal oversight of the $62 billion cosmetics industry. Continued The FDA doesn’t have the authority to recall the products on its own or to test a product for safety until someone complains. That’s what it did in 2014, after receiving 127 complaints about Wen cleansing conditioners -- the highest it had ever received about a hair cleaning product. The FDA sent a warning letter to the company and investigated its manufacturing sites. It issued an alert in July about the cleansing conditioners while it continues looking into what, if anything, led to hair loss and breakage. Should the FDA’s investigation find that something in the Wen products caused the reaction, the most the agency can do is ask the company to voluntarily pull them from shelves. Given a heightened awareness of the health risks that ordinary beauty products and cosmetics may pose, Congress has stepped in with proposals to boost the FDA’s authority. Lawmakers have introduced two bills pushing for more regulation of cosmetics: the Safe Cosmetics Modernization Act, introduced by Rep. Pete Sessions, R-TX, and the bipartisan Personal Care Products Safety Act, co-sponsored by Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Susan Collins (R-ME). The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee held a hearing on the Feinstein-Collins bill on Sept. 22; it won’t be put to a vote until 2017. Both bills would require companies to register with the FDA, submit product ingredient lists, notify the FDA of any reports of serious side effects, and authorize the FDA to prohibit the sale of products that have been found to cause serious health risks. The Feinstein-Collins bill would also require larger cosmetics manufacturers to pay a fee based on annual revenues. Feinstein says that the Wen case highlights why the bill is needed. “With increasing evidence that certain ingredients are linked to a range of health concerns, ranging from reproductive disorders to cancer, it’s critical that we update the 80-year-old law designed to ensure personal care products are safe,” Feinstein wrote in an email. The Personal Care Products Council, a lobbyist for the industry that represents companies like Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson, has announced its support of the proposal, along with the Environmental Working Group and a handful of medical associations. Continued “We believe that well-crafted, science-based reforms will enhance our industry’s ability to innovate and further strengthen consumer confidence and trust in the products they use every day,” John Hurson, executive vice president for government affairs for the council, wrote in a media statement. The Feinstein-Collins bill also mandates that the FDA test at least five ingredients in the products for safety. Every year, they would have to test different ingredients. In the first year after it passes, they include formaldehyde; propyl paraben; diazolidinyl urea; lead acetate; and quaternium-15. They are preservatives and antimicrobials found in products ranging from shaving cream to moisturizers. Ingredients like parabens are endocrine-disrupting and can affect reproduction and organ development, says Heather Patisaul, PhD, a biology professor at North Carolina State University. She is a spokeswoman for the 18,000-member Endocrine Society, which supports the Feinstein-Collins bill. There is also evidence that some of the chemicals, like formaldehyde, may raise the chance of getting cancer. Patisaul acknowledges that age, sensitivity, and length of exposure to an ingredient affect how a person might react. Millions of people use creams, balms, and hair products every day, and don’t have health problems. “When we’re thinking of how chemicals are affecting people, we need to consider how they affect sensitive individuals,” she says. “We’re not trying to demonize all chemicals, but to find a small subset that is the most problematic.” Law professor and former FDA attorney Patricia Zettler says that in the decades since the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act was enacted, we know far more about the things we put on and in our bodies. “It makes sense to consider whether the regulatory system we have is what we want,” she says. Cost, though, is an issue, as is a lack of consensus on the safety of the chemicals that help our moisturizers stay fresher and smell better longer. “Part of the issue with cosmetics may be that we just don’t have scientific certainty about ingredients, so one thing to consider is, do we want labels or better information and research about the impact of ingredients and cosmetics? What do we want out of policy?” Zettler says. Continued Calderon, the former Wen hair products user, supports more transparency among cosmetics manufacturers. Simply using a hair product turned her life upside-down, she says. She stopped volunteering at a local health center and dropped out of a college class that required her to speak in public. “Everybody thought I was losing my mind,” she says. “In a sense, I was. I feel like gradually losing your hair is a little worse than losing it in clumps.” WebMD Health News Reviewed by Brunilda Nazario, MD on September 23, 2016 Sources SOURCES: Krista Calderon. FDA.

"Evolution is essential to remain relevant and thrive, and we're constantly evolving our business, building on an already strong foundation to deliver good growth — growth that's profitable, responsible and sustainable — for the long term," said Chairman and CEO Benno Dorer. "From our origins in disinfecting as a bleach company to our recent acquisition of digestive health company Renew Life, Clorox offers a broad portfolio of brands that make a difference in the health and wellness of people's lives. This report also showcases how we've evolved to create meaningful value for all our stakeholders." The report details the company's progress against its 2020 Strategy, which encompasses financial and corporate responsibility performance, in areas such as innovation, technology, employee engagement, diversity, environmental sustainability and community support. The report's feature story on health and wellness shows how the company's portfolio includes brands that encourage a better diet, enhance skin care, and help create healthier surroundings in homes and businesses. A companion video, featuring a conversation with Dorer, provides further insight into the company's health and wellness journey. The company's 2016 fiscal year financial results include the following: $5.8 billion in net sales $398 million in cash dividends 36 percent total shareholder return, third in the company's peer group [1] 3 percent incremental sales from product innovation These key nonfinancial metrics are among those highlighted in the report: 87 percent employee engagement, which is one point higher than last year, eight points higher than levels at global fast-moving consumer goods companies [2] and about three points higher than companies combining superior financial performance and human resources practices. [3] A recordable incident rate of 0.61 — a measure of workplace safety that is superior to world-class norms. [4] Diversity in corporate governance, including 50 percent minority independent board members, 30 percent female independent board members and 31 percent female Clorox Executive Committee members. Environmental sustainability improvements marked by cumulative reductions in greenhouse gas emissions (17 percent), solid waste to landfill (25 percent), energy consumption (14 percent) and water consumption (14 percent) since 2011 [5] and cumulative product sustainability improvements to 31 percent of the company's portfolio of products. Nearly $17 million in community impact from foundation cash grants, employee volunteerism [6] , U.S. cause marketing contributions and U.S. corporate product donations. As part of Clorox's efforts to continually enhance the rigor of its corporate responsibility reporting, an independent accounting firm provided review-level assurance for 14 key nonfinancial metrics. These performance indicators are shown with an "A" symbol throughout the report. Clorox followed the Global Reporting Initiative G4 Guidelines, which provide a recommended framework and indicators for reporting. The company's report features a corporate responsibility materiality overview, including a matrix, which highlights the company's 17 priorities in this area. Incorporated into the GRI Index is the company's Communication of Progress, which describes the company's actions in implementing the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact. In October 2015, the company became a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, the world's largest organization bringing together companies, nongovernmental organizations, governments and other stakeholders to advance the most important global sustainability issues.  The 2016 integrated annual report is available online at annualreport.thecloroxcompany.com.

Peer companies — an average of 16 consumer packaged goods companies, excluding Clorox — used for benchmarking purposes. [2] The Willis Towers Watson global fast-moving consumer goods norm consists of over 162,000 employees from 59 companies. This norm is comprised of a weighted average of employee survey results from a cross-section of organizations who produce fast-moving consumer goods. The data are derived from recent client studies and a representative sample of employee data collected through general workforce attitude studies conducted by Towers Watson. The norm is updated annually. [3] The Willis Towers Watson global high-performance norm is based on responses from 145,000 employees at 28 companies. Companies qualify for the norm by meeting two criteria: 1) superior financial performance, defined by net profit margin and/or return on invested capital that exceeds industry averages; and 2) superior human resources practices, defined by employee opinion scores near the top among the most financially successful companies surveyed by Willis Towers Watson. [4] Based on corporate benchmarking by Clorox, we consider a recordable incident rate, or RIR, of 1.0 or less to be world-class. Our FY16 RIR of 0.61 means that for every 100 Clorox employees, we averaged less than one reportable incident during this past year. According to the latest available data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average RIR for goods-producing manufacturing companies is 3.8. The criteria used to determine RIR follows U.S. Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration guidelines and is applied globally. [5] CY 2015 vs. CY 2011 per case of product sold.

Less than 5 percent of these hours are by employees outside the U.S., but all are calculated using the U.S. average rate.   Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160923/411416 Logo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160913/407107LOGO Video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I90kfDVyRE   To view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/evolve-this-clorox-2016-integrated-annual-report-highlights-fiscal-year-progress-against-2020-strategy-and-more-than-a-century-of-evolution-in-health-and-wellness-300333576.html SOURCE The Clorox Company Copyright (C) 2016 PR Newswire.

To support Ad Age and the industry we cover please either: SUBSCRIBE or WHITELIST US In an Ad Blocking Battle, Whose Side Is Google On? By George Slefo. Published on September 26, 2016. Reprints Reprints Most Popular Ad blocking looks increasingly like the marketing industry's forever war, with plenty of damage done but little resolved. Publishers are experimenting with keeping out visitors who run ad blocking software, for example, only to see their tech inadvertently turn away "innocent" people. The makers of Adblock Plus initially fought Facebook's countermeasures by wiping out not just ads, but other posts too. And now even Adblock Plus wants to sell ads, news that only deepened the cynicism among its users. But along with the intrusive pop-ups and tracking cookies that drive people to block ads, the web is marked by an unusual concentration of power at just two companies: Google and Facebook. Many participants in the internet economy are nervous about the duopoly's ability to set the terms online. Now what they—especially Google—do next could potentially steer the outcome of this conflict for better or for worse. Adblock Plus has actually had a good thing going with Google until now, charging it and other major players to participate in its Acceptable Ads program. Adblock Plus, a for-profit enterprise, says it takes a 30% cut for letting those ads through. (Smaller publishers take part for free.) Although it's unclear how much money Google is kicking in, it's bound to be covering a big chunk of the bills for Eyeo, the maker of Adblock Plus. Then earlier this month, Adblock Plus bungled the announcement of its plan to create its own ad exchange through a partnership with a company called ComboTag. Dubbed the Acceptable Ads Platform, initial reports said Google and AppNexus would supply ads to it, news that left marketers with their mouths open. "This launch was riddled with hyperbole," said Brian Kane, co-founder and chief operating officer at Sourcepoint, a company that helps publishers figure out how to counter ad blockers. "It was surprising that they would name AppNexus and Google as partners, but the truth is AppNexus and Google did have a relationship with ComboTag. If they hadn't gone public with it, my guess is AppNexus and Google would have continued to do business with ComboTag." As it happened, AppNexus cut ties with both ComboTag and Adblock Plus, adding that it holds the existing Acceptable Ads toll booths "in low regard." Google distanced itself too, saying it was parting ways with ComboTag and wouldn't have anything to do with an Adblock Plus ad exchange. "It's an uncomfortable development for us," Sridhar Ramaswamy, senior VP of ads and commerce at Google, told a gaggle of reporters at the Dmexco conference in Cologne, Germany. "We have no involvement in their program and this is not a business we want to be part of." But the debacle drew attention to the involvement Google does have with Adblock Plus. In fact, Google is likely Adblock Plus' largest, most lucrative customer. Paying Eyeo allows Google's keyword search ads to survive the filters of Adblock Plus, one of the most popular ad blocking systems available. The sums involved are not small. EMarketer estimates Google will capture $47.57 billion in search ad revenue in 2016, representing 55% of the search ad market worldwide. The web's other great power, Facebook, has been less amenable to ad blockers' agenda. The social media powerhouse has lately been trying to foil Adblock Plus by making it hard for the software to tell ads apart from the rest of its content. It took the opportunity to call out the pay-for-passage system that keeps Eyeo running. "Some ad blocking companies accept money in exchange for showing ads that they previously blocked—a practice that is at best confusing to people and that reduces the funding needed to support the journalism and other free services we enjoy on the web," Andrew Bosworth, VP of ads and business platforms at Facebook, wrote in a blog post. "Rather than paying ad blocking companies to unblock the ads we show—as some of these companies have invited us to do in the past—we're putting control in people's hands with our updated ad preferences and our other advertising controls," he added. The fight soon became half arms race, half PR battle, with Adblock Plus quickly announcing a workaround and Facebook retorting that the "fix" erased users' content along with ads. Facebook seems to have gotten the better of the ad blockers for now, but that's not likely to be the end of it. "This is not the way we think is the most constructive because Facebook's approach critically leaves out one group and that's the user," said Adblock Plus spokesman Ben Williams. Meanwhile, just days after Adblock Plus kicked the hornet's nest anew with its ad-selling scheme, Google came out to say it had teamed with Procter & Gamble, Unilever, The Washington Post, the 4A's agency association and others to form the Coalition for Better Ads. Its collective goal is to monitor the quality of ads with a system now in development at the Interactive Advertising Bureau's Tech Lab. Only ads that make it through the coalition's filter will appear on the websites of participating companies. If Google and others decide that they've cleaned up web advertising enough, will the temptation grow to quit paying into Adblock Plus and its Acceptable Ads? With neither Facebook's nor Google's financial support, funding for Adblock Plus would look very different, to say the least. Eyeo's business model has separately come under increased legal scrutiny in the company's homeland of Germany. In June, Cologne's higher court sided with Axel Springer, saying that Adblock Plus can obstruct ads, but can't charge the publishing giant to let its ads appear. Mr. Williams said potential pressure on Acceptable Ads revenue was not a main motivation for the plan to sell ads, and that losing one paying partner, even Google, wouldn't be devastating. "I would not classify this as a 'let's prepare' type of thing," he said. "That wasn't part of the decision-making process at all." "I want to be really clear," Mr. Williams added. "We are a company. We're not a nonprofit and we're not trying to be. So of course profit is one of our motivations. And I think that gets lost in the discussion. We have to pay our employees and I'm not sorry about that. But at the end of the day, I do think it is possible to do something that is beneficial and can serve a greater good, but that also makes money."

Blame higher grocery prices on regulations Kristin Mullins 4:33 p.m. EDT September 27, 2016 Kristin Mullins (Photo: Provided) Kristin Mullins is president and CEO of the Ohio Grocers Association, which represents nearly 400 grocers, wholesalers, brokers and associate members.  Consider a box of Frosted Flakes. At grocers large and small throughout Ohio, it costs about $3.50 for the basic family staple. Included in that price is any number of costs, ranging from growing the corn to manufacturing the box to transporting the product to stores. As is more often becoming the case, however, those prices on everyday staples are reflecting the heavy cost of regulatory compliance. From food producers to retailers, the cost of complying with unnecessary, burdensome state and federal regulations is eating an increasingly large portion of the already razor-thin margins for which our members – from Kroger to your local corner market – operate. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, President Obama is set to leave office as one of the most prolific regulators in history, as the federal government has issued 600 major regulations since 2009, impacting family-run grocers to large-scale manufacturers. And it’s about to get even worse. Enter the U.S. Treasury Department and its proposed regulations targeting corporate inversions – the rare practice in which a U.S. company purchases a smaller, foreign-based company to lower its tax burden. If this regulation – commonly referred to as Section 385 – were drafted in a narrow manner to target the actual abuses they were meant to address, it wouldn’t be a concern to Ohio’s grocers and the hard-working families we serve. But Treasury came up with a regulatory scheme that’s so broad it will alter day-to-day business operations and negatively impact every facet of our nation’s economy. Consider, for example, cash pooling – the basic process by which many businesses manage their day-to-day expenses. Just as a family pools together incomes and resources into a central account to pay for grocery bills or a mortgage, for example, companies with multiple locations and operations do the same, just on a larger scale. This broadly used tool, which has nothing to do with tax avoidance, enables companies to best allocate resources internally. Under Section 385, the government would decide how a business should best manage its internal operations as this basic cash management practice would essentially be banned, upending years of well-supported effective practice. But under Treasury’s new rule, this basic cash management practice – one that has nothing to do with taxes or inversions – would essentially be banned, upending years of well-supported, efficient practices. What’s more, implementing these regulations will result in unnecessary complexity and incredible cost for domestic businesses. In fact, Kroger chairman and CEO Rodney McMullen wrote in a July letter to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew that “The Kroger Co. may find itself in situation where we have to put in place burdensome documentation” – documentation that would be very costly for a company that operates on “very narrow margins.” With companies spending more on unnecessary regulatory compliance, that’s valuable capital that could’ve been invested in expanding a store or hiring more baggers at the check-out register, for example. McMullen isn’t alone as other Ohio leaders, including Procter & Gamble’s David Taylor, also wrote in a separate letter that the proposed Section 385 regulations would “disrupt ordinary business transactions” and “further reduce the competitive position of U.S. businesses.” Ultimately, the proposed Section 385 rules merely address the symptom rather than cure the disease that is America’s complex and uncompetitive tax code. Rather than bury job creators in more pages of regulations, the Obama administration should put the brakes on this dangerous proposal so Treasury can revise the regulation without placing heavy burdens on domestic job creators. 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 6 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2dAGclZ TOP VIDEOS Watch Google Home struggle to answer queries 1:34 Cole Swindell has ‘You Should be Here’ moment on CMA Awards red carpet 2:01 Cole Swindell talks about is favorite 30 seconds while on CMA Awards red carpet! 1:01 RaeLynn’s reaction to watching old clips from ‘The Voice’ is priceless! 0:50 What’s it like to be inducted into Country Music Hall of Fame?

(Mark Blinch For The Globe and Mail) Executive search specialist Tanya van Biesen has been named executive director of Catalyst Canada. (Mark Blinch For The Globe and Mail) Catalyst’s new executive director sees wealth of ‘untapped’ talent in Canada Add to ... Janet McFarland The Globe and Mail Published Tuesday, Sep. 27, 2016 12:06PM EDT Last updated Tuesday, Sep. 27, 2016 12:46PM EDT Comments Print / License AA The new head of women’s advocacy group Catalyst Canada says two decades of work searching for executives to fill senior roles in Canada has convinced her there is no shortage of talented women for top jobs, and has left her impatient with holdouts who continue to argue they can’t find qualified candidates. Executive search specialist Tanya van Biesen has been named executive director of Catalyst Canada, and said she knows plenty of talented women to fill senior roles without requiring companies to compromise quality. “I worked with clients every day on the difficulty of attracting talent, and I think there is such an untapped opportunity in this country and other countries around using the full weight of the work force,” Ms. van Biesen said in an interview. “If we as a society could just figure out how to better define the contributions people could make at the board level of the executive level, I think we could tap into such a large talent base.” Ms. van Biesen has worked at search firm Spencer Stuart since 2005, most recently co-leading the financial services practice at the firm, focusing on searches for directors, CEOs and general management-level executives. She also led the search firm’s Canadian diversity practice, helping companies hire chief diversity officers or find diverse slates of candidates for other roles. Ms. van Biesen will begin her new role at Catalyst next week, replacing former executive director Alex Johnston, who left in February to become vice-president of strategy and public affairs at the CBC. Catalyst advocates for women in senior roles, sponsors research and works directly with individual companies developing diversity strategies. Ms. van Biesen said she has been a strong supporter of new “comply or explain” rules in Canada, requiring companies to report annually on whether they have diversity policies or targets for women. But she said she has seen many companies use “easy outs” to explain why they have no policies while continuing to have no women in senior roles. “This is not a zero-sum game – this is not a woman gets a job so man doesn’t,” she said. “This is about building on the prosperity of this country… It’s about growing the pie, it’s not about me getting a piece and you not getting a piece. I’d be the wrong person for this job if I didn’t believe there is a pie to grow here.” She argues the discussion about advancing women has to shift from whether or why companies need more women in senior roles toward practical advice on how they can find and advance them. “I think the question is not so much ‘why’ any more but how – how do we break down the barriers and how do we access the talent pool?” she said. Catalyst CEO Deborah Gillis, who heads the New York-based organization, said Ms. van Biesen’s experience at the most senior levels of Corporate Canada means she “understands the competitive talent environment and the challenges facing women today.” “Her ability to work with others to inspire change will be a tremendous asset to the organization and our supporters as we continue to expand in Canada,” Ms. Gillis said in a statement. Ms. van Biesen began her career at Procter & Gamble, working in Toronto and Calgary in sales roles, and later worked at search firm TMP Worldwide Inc. and its predecessors in Canada before joining Spencer Stuart. She holds an MBA from the University of Toronto and a bachelor of commerce degree from Queen’s University. She is currently the Toronto chapter representative of the WomenCorporateDirectors Foundation, a global membership organization for female board directors.

(AP Photo/NBC, Virginia Sherwood) comments Don't be surprised if elements of "Peter Pan" show up in the commercial breaks during NBC's live Thursday telecast of the famous 1904 play. Walmart, which ran ads during NBC's live broadcast of "The Sound of Music" last year that used songs from the play to make a marketing point, will again serve as lead sponsor of the live event, and will use commercials that echo the action that just took place in the play just before the production cuts to advertising. All five of the spots will also feature Tinkerbell (or, at least, the version of the character being used in the NBC production). Walmart will have the heaviest presence in what is a sold-out program, said Dan Lovinger, executive vice president of entertainment ad sales at NBCUniversal. "I think that the industry, and certainly America, is really falling in love with concepts like this," he said. "It's a great family event. It gives people the opportunity during the holidays to sit down together to watch a show that everyone can be comfortable with." Set to air live at 8 p.m. on Thursday, December 4, NBC's "Peter Pan" production shows the network doubling down on a gambit that worked well last year - and is gaining traction across the TV-scape. Just as Discovery Channel's recent broadcasts of daredevil Nik Wallenda walking a tightrope over Chicago and in the vicinity of the Grand Canyon have lured viewers, so too has the prospect of seeing up-and-coming celebrities hold forth in the title role of NBC's theatrical events. Allison Williams will play Peter Pan while Christopher Walken will play Captain Hook. The network's live broadcast of "The Sound of Music" attracted more than 18 million viewers. NBC has already unveiled plans to mount a live production of "The Music Man" in 2015. Demand for the show has been high, as more advertisers demonstrate a craving to link to the growing number of live events TV networks are testing to lure bigger crowds. NBC sought more than $350,000 for a 30-second spot in the show, Lovinger said, confirming a previous report in Variety. He declined to name other advertisers in the event, but said the show had support from the restaurant, electronics, movie-studio and wireless categories. In five Walmart ads slated to run at specific moments during the program, viewers will see actress Melissa Joan Hart and her actual family in scenes that play off "Peter Pan" moments while also showcasing products available at Walmart. Hart is currently involved in Walmart's holiday campaign. In the first of the spots produced by NBCUniversal, Hart will read a bedtime story to her family as they talk about pajamas (available, as it might happen, for purchase at the large retailer. In a second, the family will play with a Tinkerbell toy and Hart will show her family a "Lost Boys" tree hour lit up in the backyard. In a third, Hart's sons play in the tree house while shouting "Wendy." In a fourth, Hart's family sits around the dinner table preparing to make homemade cookies. In the fifth, and last, Hart reads "Peter Pan" to her kids and talks to them about growing up. NBC was not able to say whether all the Walmart ads will run immediately after the broadcast cuts to an ad break - where they would have the most relevance - or deeper in the mix of promotions that run in each commercial interruption. The concept sounds easier to put into practice than the idea Walmart used during its 2013 sponsorship of "The Sound of Music." As part of that effort, NBC produced a series of spots featuring the Brooks family of Gardner, Kansas, which has 12 children. The clan was spotted at various points in the broadcast doing activities to the strains of the popular tunes from the play. Each spot appeared after the song being featured had been sung in the show. NBCUniversal actually did a four-day talent search for the family that eventually appeared in the ads, which were also produced by the company without the use of an ad agency. Mediavest, an ad-buying firm that is part of France's Publicis Groupe, helped Walmart negotiate the price and placement of its "Peter Pan" campaign. Marketers have shown new interest in crafting commercials for very specific occasions, a reflection, perhaps, of a desire to emulate the content that drew viewers in the first place, instead of interrupting the experience. "Clients in general are getting more and more creative and more demanding to create content that's relevant and resonates with not only our viewers but their consumers," said Lovinger. NBC and Walmart have a history of teaming up for family fare. In 2010, the retailer and Procter & Gamble joined with NBC to create a TV movie, "Secrets of the Mountain," that aimed to offer an alternative to what the advertisers viewed as an increase in risqué fare on the boob tube. After "Mountain" ran in April, a similar effort, "The Jensen Project," aired in July of that year. Broadcasts of the films featured both ads from each company as well as placements of their products and logos in the content itself. Walmart has been spotted sponsoring other pieces of family fare this week. Last night, the retailer had two different commercials run during ABC's "Toy Story That Time Forgot." © 2014 Variety Media, LLC, a subsidiary of Penske Business Media; Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC     More On: Tribune Content Agency Walmart Peter Pan Live!
