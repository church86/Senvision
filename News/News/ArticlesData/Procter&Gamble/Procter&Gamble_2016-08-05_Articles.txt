Chitra Narayanan   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet Salt of the earth: Wrestler Babita Kumari in the ‘Namak ke Waastey’ campaign Salt of the earth: Boxer Shiva Thapa in the ‘Namak ke Waastey’ campaign If brands appear less vocal this time going into the Olympics, there are other factors at play than the troubles plaguing Brazil For brands looking to associate themselves with the Olympics, Rio 2016 is admittedly one of the riskiest Games to sponsor. Brazil is in the midst of a political crisis and a recession, haunted by the Zika virus, and to top it all the Russian doping scandal threatens to play spoilsport. Particularly in contrast to the London 2012 Games, where brands created quite a buzz, Rio feels like a subdued party. But don’t blame it on Rio alone. In India, at least, even brands that traditionally team up with big-ticket sports events find that activations around Olympics make little sense as traditionally the Games have low viewership at home. This time, the time difference - India is 8-1/2 hours ahead of Brazil - is a spoiler too. Also, gone are the days when brands geared up months ahead of D-day. Today, even at the global level, activations start much later - although P&G kicked off its Rio campaign 100 days ahead of the opening ceremony. Also, this time around, many companies are strategically choosing digital and social media, which require far less time and monies to flag off. Legacy connections When you look at the official sponsors of the Games, there are no surprises. It’s the old-economy warhorses - Coca-Cola, Atos, Bridgestone, Dow, GE, McDonald’s, Omega, Panasonic, P&G, Samsung, Toyota and Visa - that are supporting the games. Where are the world’s most valuable brands: the new economy giants such as Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Amazon, Uber? Brand strategist Ambi Parameswaran has a theory about this. He points out that if sponsorship costs X million dollars, the brand will have to be ready to spend 2X million dollars in promoting the association to get a positive rub-off. As he explains, “When it comes to leverage, legacy brands with retail presence and physical product space have a big advantage. They have a lot more ‘owned media’ so to speak. The new-age digital brands like Amazon, Airbnb or Uber are yet to get a handle on how to do this.” Having said that, of course, Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Airbnb are all there at the Game of Gods in a big way. Airbnb is already creating a huge buzz as the official ‘hospitality’ supplier to Rio, pipping big hotel chains. Microsoft is an official supplier too. Facebook’s content stream is exploding in innovative ways as it takes its 1.65 billion users to the Games. History has shown that brands can extract mileage from the event even without being a sponsor. In order to be top Olympic partner, brands like P&G, Coke and McDonald’s spend upward of $1 billion and, yet, Nike -- which is not a sponsor, although it is an official supplier -- usually walks away from the Games with as much brand recall. Coca-Cola goes for gold Quite a few of the Olympic sponsors have got off the starting blocks already. P&G, which scored a mega hit at London with its ‘Thank You Mum’ campaign, is continuing with it, bringing moms back at Rio; Big Mac is putting kids centrestage, sending 200 children from around the world to the Rio Olympics village, where it will have a dedicated eatery; Samsung has a heartwarming anthem on international unity featuring its Galaxy S7 edge and some top global athletes, even though in India its Olympic Ratna programme is glaring in its absence. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola, one of the oldest partners of the Olympics (it has been a sponsor since 1928), is staying loyal to the Games and aiming for gold at Rio. #That’sGold is the Coke campaign theme at Rio. India will stick to the theme, but mainly through digital activations. “We will be executing the #That’sGold creative idea in India by primarily leveraging the social and digital media space,” says a Coke spokesperson. A small group of employees of Coca-Cola India and its bottling companies are being sent to Rio to experience and narrate their own gold stories and share them. Coca-Cola India will also celebrate achievements of Indian Olympians at Rio, their wins and their regimen through stories on social media. Nimesh Shah, head maven at social media agency Windchimes, feels the right strategy in India is to go solely digital. “The cost of on-ground activation is very high, and given that the attention on the Olympics is limited, it may not pay off. Whereas with social and digital media, you can activate quickly and inexpensively,” he says. Blood, sweat and salt Even if the global sponsors are fairly low key in their India efforts, local brands like Tata Salt have stepped up and are going full sprint with the Olympics hype. The fact that this year India is sending its largest-ever contingent is spurring Tata Salt. Says Sagar Boke, Head-Marketing, Tata Chemicals Ltd (Consumer Products Business), “We believe that at this year’s Olympics, what really matters is the fact that India is sending its largest contingent ever in its history and that it is up to us as a nation to encourage their participation rather than focussing on winning at the Olympics.” Tata Salt’s Namak ke Waastey campaign is using digital, social media, radio, TV as well as on-ground activations. From the Great Indian Run spread over six States, to limited-edition Olympics packs that will reach out to over 7 crore households and urging consumers to give a missed call to record their wishes to support the Indian Olympics contingent, the brand has lots planned. And even before our sporting heroes make it to the victory podium, Tata Salt has a one billion victory selfie campaign all planned out too!

(NYSE: PG) reported fourth-quarter and fiscal-year 2016 results before markets opened Tuesday. For the quarter, the consumer products maker posted adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.79 on revenues of $16.1 billion. In the same period a year ago, the company reported EPS of $0.93 on revenues of $16.55 billion. Fourth-quarter results also compare to the Thomson Reuters consensus estimates for EPS of $0.74 and $15.83 billion in revenues. For the full year, P&G posted adjusted diluted EPS of $3.67 on revenues of $65.3 billion, compared with 2015 EPS of $3.76 and revenues of $76.28 billion. Consensus estimates called for EPS of $3.64 on sales of $65.06 billion. On a currency neutral basis, P&G’s quarterly adjusted EPS declined by 8% and rose by 7% for the full year. P&G’s guidance for its 2017 fiscal year tabs organic sales growth of 2%, but just 1% when taking into account currency exchange estimates and “minor brand divestitures.” Core (adjusted) earnings are forecast to rise by mid-single digits compared with fiscal 2016 and GAAP earnings are forecast to rise by 45% to 55% including a $0.10 per share charge for restructuring costs and an undetermined benefit from the sale of 41 beauty brands to Coty. Consensus estimates call for first-quarter fiscal 2017 EPS of $1.00 on revenues of $16.51 billion. For the full year, the estimate for EPS is $3.96 and revenues are pegged at $65.95 billion. CEO David Taylor said: Looking forward, we’re committed to continued productivity improvement and cost savings that provide the fuel for innovation and investments needed to accelerate and sustain faster top-line growth. We expect fiscal 2017 to mark another significant step toward our goal of balanced growth and value creation and total shareholder return in the top third of our competitive peer group. The company lowered its cost of goods sold by 5% year over year in the fourth quarter and by 11% compared with 2015. That was enough to report gross profits for the quarter flat with a year ago and down by 4% for the full year. P&G’s shares traded up about 0.7% in Tuesday’s premarket session, at $87.04 in a 52-week range of $65.02 to $86.89. Thomson Reuters had a consensus 12-month price target of $86.47 before the report.

The maker of Tide detergent, Charmin toilet paper and Pantene shampoo said its sales declined for its fiscal fourth quarter, hurt by unfavorable currency exchange rates.

Olympic athletes lend P&G advertising muscle Alexander Coolidge , acoolidge@enquirer.com 10:16 p.m. EDT August 5, 2016 U.S. gymnast Simone Biles is featured in P&G's Tide Pods advertising. (Photo: Provided) As athletes from around the world battle for Olympic glory in Rio de Janeiro this month, they will also compete for the hearts – and wallets – of consumers. Procter & Gamble, the world's largest advertiser, is using its sponsorship of the summer games and athletes to barrage consumers with messages on TV airwaves and social media in dozens of countries. The Olympics begin Friday and run through Aug. 21. Analysts say the Olympics inspire spectators with displays of triumph, endurance, teamwork, strength and agility. Cincinnati-based consumer products giant P&G wants to maximize its visibility and association with winning athletes to capture some of that goodwill. "What P&G tries to do is create an emotional bond between a consumer and their brand – why else would a consumer pay so much for laundry detergent?" Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj said. With customers in 180 countries around the globe, P&G isn't limiting itself to rooting for its home team – a third of the company's sales come from the United States. But industry tracker Euromonitor says retail sales of the company's products are robust in several countries including Olympics host country Brazil. The torrent of ads comes after two stormy years of P&G overhauling its advertising spending. Procter has slashed a third of its spending with marketing agencies and severed ties with 40 percent of firms doing work for it. The company has plowed the savings back into increasing of advertising its top brands and pushing deeper into digital and social media messaging. "They want to spend more money on actual advertising the consumer sees and less on agencies," Barclays analyst Lauren Lieberman said.  (Photo: Provided) Brazil Annual retail sales estimate of P&G products: $4.1 billion Brands: Familiar labels like Always, Olay and Pantene are sold in addition to others including Prestobarba disposable razors and Hipoglos baby skin care cream. Athlete: Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior, or Neymar Jr., 24 Sport: Soccer Participating in: Gillette's "Perfect Isn’t Pretty," which depicts the less glamorous side of sports with grueling training regimens, early mornings and family tension. The ad cuts between team practices and features domestic scenes with Neymar and his crying infant son. The ad also features U.S. decathlete Ashton Eaton, Chinese swimmer Ning Zetao and British cyclist Andy Tennant.  (Photo: Provided) China Est. sales: $10.4 billion Athlete: Zhao Lina, 24 Sport: Soccer Participating in: Always/Whisper's Keep Playing #LikeAGirl, which encourages girls to stay in sports to maintain confidence. The ads don't depict any professional athletes, but rather the concerns of girls on the cusp of puberty intercut with scenes of them competing in sports. Zhao has shattered stereotypes in China where soccer has long been considered a man's sport. The campaign also includes U.S. soccer player Alex Morgan and U.K. cyclist Laura Trott. Brands: Both Ariel and Tide premium laundry detergents are sold in China while Rejoice is a blockbuster shampoo brand on par with Head & Shoulders. SK-II is now P&G's first brand developed outside the United States to reach $1 billion in annual sales.  (Photo: Provided) Japan Est. sales: $3.4 billion Brands: Pampers diapers and Gillette razors are mainstays, but Joy is a laundry detergent alongside Ariel and Lenor, a fabric softener brand. Athlete: Kei Nishikori, 26 Sport: Tennis Participating in: P&G's "Thank You, Mom" campaign. One of the reasons P&G chose Nishikori was his strong relationship with his mother and family. Ads featuring Nishikori will be appearing in TV and digital throughout Japan leading up to and during the Games.  (Photo: Provided) United Kingdom Est. sales: $5 billion Brands: Bold is a top laundry brand as well as Ariel, while Fairy is the detergent for your dishwasher and Flash is a household cleaner. Athlete: Jessica Ennis-Hill, 30 Sport: Track and field Participating in: "Thank You, Mum" campaign – offering her duel perspective as both a daughter, but also a mother herself. Her son Reggie is two years old. Ennis-Hill appears in ads that encourage mothers to celebrate their little one's champion moves. USA Est. sales: $32.5 billion Brands: The home market sells most of P&G's remaining 65 brands from 10 core product categories and is the traditional launching pad for new product innovations. Athlete: Simone Biles, 19 Sport: Gymnast Participating in: Tide Pods' Small Powerful Tide spot, which touts the brand's mighty cleaning power in a compact unit dose. The ad features the 4-foot-8-inch tall athlete delivering a powerful impact as she navigates her day: shaking the judges' table after nailing a landing during a floor routine; throwing a bouquet of flowers into an audience with a little too much force and accidently knocking over a row of lockers with a door slam. 5 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2aK5F7X TOP VIDEOS Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 22 17:46 Joe Deters asks for retrial of Ray Tensing, seeks change of venue 3:07 Black Friday secrets the stores don't want you to know 1:01 Finding home: A 12-year-old boy's search in the midst of war 6:41 Bills-Bengals postgame wrap 3:10 Bengals vs. Bills Week 11 predictions 6:02 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 15. 20:46 Supermoon rises over Cincinnati 0:55 Bengals vs. Giants wrap-up 3:15 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29 Jeff Ruby: 'I sense there is not going to be justice' for the DuBose family 2:18 Deters on Tensing crying on the stand: ‘The place to be upset... was after you just blew someone's brains out' 26:55 Defense makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 41:26 Prosecution makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 26:35 Tensing: 'Oh my God, he's going to run me over, he's going to kill me' 12:03 Use-of-force expert: 'The actions of Ray Tensing were justified' 0:50 Which stores are opening, closing Thanksgiving Day 0:34 \u0022I can't wait to see Tensing on the stand\u0022 0:55 Cincinnati Police Criminalist: Tensing 'seemed nervous or afraid' 2:59

(Photo: Al Behrman, AP) Procter & Gamble may be looking at a growth "tool" that hasn't been part of the company's vocabulary in recent years: acquisitions. Nearly done with a flurry of divestitures aimed at refocusing on core consumer product brands, CEO David Taylor told The Cincinnati Enquirer and Wall Street analysts acquisitions might be an avenue to speed sales growth. Taylor's declaration isn't just idle chatter. P&G's cash on hand is at its highest level in more than a decade. The company also predicts only modest sales and profit growth in 2017. P&G hasn't made a significant acquisition since it bought Ambi Pur air freshener brand from Sara Lee for $468 million in 2009. Critics in the investment community for years panned P&G's efforts to integrate Gillette after a $57 billion takeover in 2006. Taylor pledged to be picky, but said P&G won't be "encumbered" by the past. He said P&G recently considered a deal, but declined to reveal more information about it. "We looked at one last year," Taylor said. "We haven't been very aggressive on this front because of the portfolio cleanup, but acquisitions are a tool. We haven't shut our eyes to opportunities." After two years of selling or exiting 105 laggard brands, P&G has more than $13.3 billion of cash and securities on its balance sheet. That's approaching enough money to buy Macy's outright without borrowing. Taylor said P&G got "over aggressive" in the past with acquisitions that got the company into lines of business that were ultimately a distraction. P&G's separation from 41 beauty brands that will ultimately land with New York-based Coty is one of several recent deals that unloads brands acquired in previous shopping sprees. The Coty deal includes Wella hair color, which P&G bought in 2003 for $5.8 billion. This spring, P&G sold the Duracell battery brand it acquired as part of the Gillette deal. Taylor said future P&G acquisitions should be "strategic" and spur growth within the company's 10 consumer product categories, from baby care to grooming. The company's investment focus will be on adding businesses that fill in categories where it already competes. As P&G is nearly finished in its recent brand-shedding drive, Taylor said the company is reinvesting sale proceeds into innovation and advertising to jumpstart sales growth. The company focuses on a metric called "organic sales," which is sales excluding impacts from foreign exchange and mergers and acquisitions. Taylor said P&G has improved its performance, but not yet where it wants to be. "We want to be at the rate of market growth plus a little extra," Taylor said, adding overall growth is 3% in the markets where P&G competes. Taylor said P&G has made progress turning around operations in China, its second-largest market behind the United States. Taylor and company officials admit they misread the China market not producing enough premium-tier products for its booming middle-class consumers. Organic sales in China slid 5 percent in the last fiscal year. "That market got significantly off-track and we didn't take advantage of premium opportunities," Taylor said, adding new product offerings in the pipeline there will address that mistake. 147 CONNECTTWEET 39 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2aIZkJS

Neto dobit kompanije je u kvartalu zaključno sa 30. junom iznosila dvije milijarde dolara, što je za 274 odsto više u odnosu na isti period prošle godine, prenosi agencija Frans pres. Prihodi su, međutim, pali za tri odsto, na 16,1 milijardu dolara. Kod svih pet kategorija robe široke potrošnje "Prokter i Gembl" je registrovao rast prometa, kada se izuzmu valutni efekti. Međutim, kada se uključe valutni efekti, promet je smanjen za tri odsto. "Četvrti kvartal je bio još jedan period napretka. Gledajući u budućnost, posvećeni smo daljem unapređivanju produktivnosti i uštedi troškova, što nam pruža podstrek za inovacije i investicije neophodne za ubrzanje i održavanje bržeg rasta", izjavio je generalni direktor kompanije Dejvid Tejlor. U čitavoj protekloj fiskalnoj godini, P&G je imao neto dobit od 10,5 milijardi dolara, što je za 49 odsto više u odnosu na godinu dana ranije. Promet u fiskalnoj 2016. godini je iznosio 65,3 milijarde dolara, što je za osam odsto manje u odnosu na fiskalnu 2015. godinu.

The story behind one of Cincy's biggest startup exits Anne Saker , asaker@enquirer.com 1:11 p.m. EDT August 8, 2016 Buy Photo Jessica Yeager works in the laboratory at Assurex Health in Mason. Assurex, one of the most promising startups in the region, was sold Wednesday for a total of $410 million. (Photo: Enquirer file)Buy Photo At the beginning of this year, Assurex Health stood in an enviable position for a relatively young biotechnology company. Its product, a genetic test for people suffering from mental health disorders, was slowly gaining acceptance. The enthusiastic sales force was growing. Venture capital was plentiful. But top Assurex Health executives including President and Chief Executive Virginia Drosos and its board of directors pondered a fundamental question – how should they manage the company's future growth. They could keep the company private, issue stock or seek a buyer. The answer arrived in the spring, Drosos said, in the form of Myriad Genetics. Myriad Genetics is a Salt Lake City-based company that developed the now-common genetic tests for breast or ovarian cancer. Drosos said she previously met company President and CEO Mark Capone at industry conferences, but conversations about a deal became serious this year. “I would say we started dating in the spring, when we asked each other out and began to explore a bit more with intention the idea that our two companies would come together,” said Drosos, a former executive of the Procter & Gamble Co., who joined Assurex Health three years ago. Assurex Health and Myriad Genetics signed a deal Wednesday, and Capone told industry analysts that the purchase was the biggest in Myriad Genetics’ history. The sale price is $225 million with another $185 million to come when performance-based milestones are met. Capone told analysts Assurex Health will easily meet the targets for that additional payout. Assurex Health, now 10 years old, got its initial funding from the local investment group Queen City Angels, and later from CincyTech, the local seed stage startup investor. CincyTech Managing Director Mike Venerable said Wednesday’s deal for Assurex Health was the largest ever for one of CincyTech's portfolio company. “Obviously, we’ll see a very nice return on this,” Venerable said. When asked to be more specific, he replied, “Nope.” CincyTech is supporting 34 other startups in the area, and Venerable said he hopes the Assurex Health deal can be a benchmark for them. “It’s a good outcome for all stakeholders. We expect other companies in our portfolio to best that. That’s what they should think about.” Assurex Health grew out of research at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center and the Mayo Clinic. Its singular product is the GeneSight test, which analyzes 12 genes that influence mental health and 55 psychoactive drugs that treat a spectrum of mental-health disorders including depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. That covers about 95 percent of the drugs treating mental health disorders available now. The test result is a scoresheet of which drugs could best treat a patient. The test, Assurex Health promises, cuts down or even eliminates the usual merry-go-round of trying drug after drug after drug, with decreasing effectiveness in each medication change. In the past two years, the Department of Veterans Affairs and Medicare have been paying for the test. But private health insurers have been wary, and Drosos said a big appeal of the Myriad Genetics deal is the Utah company’s pull with insurers. “Absolutely,” Drosos said. “That is one of the key areas where they have capabilities that we can immediately leverage. They have tremendous relationships with commercial payors, and I think we can bring those things together and make more progress faster.” The GeneSight test costs about $2,000, although Assurex Health has been charging the federal government about $400 to get the test into more doctors’ toolkits. On the conference call with investors Wednesday, Capone said Assurex Health made about $60 million last year. When more private insurers start paying for the test, he said, Assurex Health can start charging the full price. But insurers would see savings in the long run when they would no longer have to pay for treatments that aren't likely to work for patients. Officials at Cincinnati Children's Hospital are taking pride in the Assurex Health sale. Jennifer Dauer, the medical center's senior vice president for strategy and growth said the deal "provides the potential to reach more mental health  patients and families with this important technology. And it motivates us to continue to work hard to bring more discoveries, therapies and solutions to patients and families." Assurex Health is in Mason, with offices in the Mason Community Center and its laboratory in the basement of Mason City Hall. Capone flew to Mason Thursday to meet with Assurex Health officials and employees. The company had planned to spend $15 million to build a new headquarters on a 30-acre site on Innovation Way, near the Western Row Road exit of Interstate 71. That project is on hold, for now, Drosos said. “We were looking to be able to stay in Mason,” Drosos said, “and we wanted to be part of a company that wanted to grow us, not part of a company that was acquiring us for synergy or just the technology, but really respected what we have been able to accomplish and help us grow even faster.” 55 CONNECTTWEET 91 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2aJhNpK TOP VIDEOS Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 22 17:46 Joe Deters asks for retrial of Ray Tensing, seeks change of venue 3:07 Black Friday secrets the stores don't want you to know 1:01 Finding home: A 12-year-old boy's search in the midst of war 6:41 Bills-Bengals postgame wrap 3:10 Bengals vs. Bills Week 11 predictions 6:02 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 15. 20:46 Supermoon rises over Cincinnati 0:55 Bengals vs. Giants wrap-up 3:15 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29 Jeff Ruby: 'I sense there is not going to be justice' for the DuBose family 2:18 Deters on Tensing crying on the stand: ‘The place to be upset... was after you just blew someone's brains out' 26:55 Defense makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 41:26 Prosecution makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 26:35 Tensing: 'Oh my God, he's going to run me over, he's going to kill me' 12:03 Use-of-force expert: 'The actions of Ray Tensing were justified' 0:50 Which stores are opening, closing Thanksgiving Day 0:34 \u0022I can't wait to see Tensing on the stand\u0022 0:55 Cincinnati Police Criminalist: Tensing 'seemed nervous or afraid' 2:59

(Photo: Enquirer file/Meg Vogel)Buy Photo A minor-league soccer team is two-thirds through its rookie season when it starts talking openly about seeking bigger pastures. Ambitious. The team is spectacularly successful. It sets league attendance records. That’s nice, but only a start. Its leaders cozy up to power brokers at the proverbial next level, suggesting they take a good, long look. Audacious. The high-ups from the bigger league actually take note of the upstart, and not disapprovingly. “Keep in touch, kid. You’ve got a shot.’’ Cincinnati? CINCINNATI.COM Buckle up, FC Cincinnati fans I don’t care if Futbol Club Cincinnati ever spends a minute playing Major League Soccer. FCC could remain in the United Soccer League from now until forever (or until the U.S. men win the World Cup, whichever comes first), and that would be OK. What’s greatest about the local side’s wooing of the MLS isn’t the possibility of moving up in class, though after two-thirds of one season of existence, that’s impressive. It’s what it represents. It’s bold. It’s visionary. It takes our town’s sometimes shaky belief in itself and slams it into a trash can. “We think we’re on the front of something special,’’ says team president and general manager Jeff Berding. “We feel strongly Cincinnati shouldn’t be left on the sidelines. Someday we’ll hopefully look back at this and be glad we didn’t lose out to other cities.’’ Buy Photo  (Photo: The Enquirer/Meg Vogel) They’ve hired a consultant. Mark McCullers is the former president of the Columbus Crew, an MLS member. McCullers offers this, when reminded it’s been barely a year since the local Futbol Club started playing: “But what a year, right? It hasn’t just been good, it’s been USL-best by a long shot. The market is credible. It’s a pro sports market. It has the culture of a pro sports town. You have a strong youth soccer community, good market demographics.’’ CINCINNATI.COM MLS should heed FC Cincinnati fever Then McCullers says this: “It’s a place that 24-34-year-olds want to live.’’ It is, isn’t it? It took a generation or so for that to be true. But the scary and fabulous truth is: We’re hip. Cincinnati is cool. FC Cincinnati is a living, growing manifestation of that. CINCINNATI.COM The cool, the class of futbol in Cincinnati Those who do the hiring at P&G, GE Aviation and Kroger must be doing back-flips. The key to any small city’s success is the young minds it’s able to hire and retain. Creative types. Eager, optimistic, smart kids who want to come to work here, or who’ve grown up here and want to stay. FC Cincinnati has bisected our town at a sweet spot in time. Millennials live, work and play Downtown. They’ve grown up loving soccer. They’ve adopted FCC. They’re bringing the rest of us along with them. McCullers says ownership is key. “The proper brains’’ is how he puts it. The Lindners didn’t get rich spending foolishly. Whether it was diligent research, keen instincts or blind luck – all three, most likely – they have tapped into a mother lode of potential. They’d like to see how far they can take it. “The Lindners are credible, they’re major-league, they fit well at the MLS ownership table,’’ McCullers says. A franchise fee of up to $200 million has been suggested. That’s a filter, insiders say, to identify the serious. A charge of $125 million is closer to reality. Berding says ownership would pay that. The soccer-only stadium isn’t a big issue, says Berding. He cites the franchises in Seattle and New England that play in NFL stadiums, and the new franchise in Atlanta, which will share a new stadium with the Falcons. Says McCullers of Nippert Stadium, “They could play MLS there tomorrow.’’ Berding hopes to get MLS officials to a game there before the year is out. Berding is also quick to say “Our immediate future is the USL and we are very comfortable with that,’’ he says. MLS expansion isn’t likely until 2020, he says. It could be an overreach. As a reader suggested to me, “I don’t see the local soccer-loving public demanding MLS so much as a good time with a winning team.’’ That could be true. Or it could be limiting. Regardless, McCullers says, “It’s hard not to have Cincinnati in the (MLS) discussion now.’’ Ownership is banking that the value of an MLS franchise will appreciate significantly over the next several years at least. As Berding puts it, “A changing sports culture has made soccer a very important sport. Twelve years ago, soccer was behind women’s figure skating in terms of public interest.’’ Those with big money invested can sweat those details. The rest of us bask in the intangibles. Pro soccer is fashionable, Cincinnati’s pro soccer market is exploding, thus Cincinnati is fashionable. And we’ve only just begun. 362 CONNECTTWEET 22 LINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORE TOP VIDEOS Dodgers great Ralph Branca dies at 90 1:15 Top five college football games to watch in Week 13 2:20 Achieving the Dream - Charles Woodson 3:40 Statistical oddities from the NBA's first month 1:52 Why the Los Angeles Clippers are rolling 1:36 Notre Dame to vacate football wins from 2012 and 2013 1:15 Bruce Arena replaces Jurgen Klinsmann as USMNT coach 1:07 Celeb Pick 'Em with Miles Teller 3:25 How the NFL playoff picture looks after Week 11 1:37 NBA weekend in review: Clippers continue to roll 1:40 Doug Baldwin speaks out on community policing 3:32 Jurgen Klinsmann fired as USMNT coach 0:48 Week 11 NFL hot reads: Redskins building solid foundation 2:36 Jimmie Johnson wins record-tying seventh Sprint Cup title 1:00 Week 12 Amway Coaches Poll 1:14 NFL players must battle altitude and pollution in Mexico City 2:41 Numbers to know for the Chase for the Sprint Cup 1:23 Who is the favorite to win the Sprint Cup title? 1:08 What to watch for in Sprint Cup race at Homestead 1:27 Lorenzo's Locks: Week 11 NFL picks 1:59 Punting tips and dance moves with Marquette King 1:00 Reflecting on Tony Stewart's legacy in NASCAR 2:52 A timeline of Johnny Manziel’s troubled history 2:02 Fighters square off at UFC Fight Night 100 faceoffs 1:14 Mets pitcher Jeurys Familia pleads not guilty to domestic violence charge 0:50

(Video: Jayne W. Orenstein/The Washington Post/Photo: Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post) When women’s gymnastics overhauled its scoring system ahead of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, the sport that had once been all about clean execution added a new focus: risk. Eight years later, there’s one gymnast who has mastered the art of execution and whose degrees of difficulty have made her the world’s best: Simone Biles. [Meet Simone Biles, who is about to turn Olympic gymnastics upside down] The gymnastics world Biles inhabits looks very different than when the “perfect 10″ made Nadia Comaneci a household name in 1976. Two scores are now tallied to create an overall score for the gymnast. The “A” score measures the difficulty of the routine and the “B” score deducts points based on mistakes. With final scores ranging from 13 to 15 and medal-winning scores rising above 16. The tougher the routine, the higher the potential score. There’s an obvious reward for the gymnasts who choose more difficult routines. During the individual all-around competition at the 2012 London Olympics, the average score for gymnasts choosing a degree of difficulty between 5.5 and 6 was 14. For those whose degree of difficulty exceeded 6.5, the average score was 15.6. But the worst score for the tougher routine was 15.1 compared with the best score of 15.2 in the less-difficult routine. In other words: go big or go home. Because Biles consistently chooses tougher routines, The Post’s Liz Clarke writes that “barring a rare misstep, she’ll be untouchable on vault, floor and beam.”   On the vault she performs the Amanar, which earned her a 6.4 degree of difficulty — it typically carries a difficulty score of 6.3 — and a 9.9 execution score at the 2015 U.S. championships for a total of 16.3 points, narrowly beating out McKayla Maroney’s routine at the 2012 Summer Games (16.2) for highest score all-time under the new scoring format. And now that it looks like Biles will upgrade her second vault to the Cheng, a move she showed off at the 2016 Pacific Rim Championships, which is usually worth a degree of difficulty of 6.4. If a back injury doesn’t force Russian Maria Paseka from the Rio Games, she might be the biggest threat to Biles. During the 2012 Games, Paseka — who beat Biles on vault at the 2015 world championships — won bronze with difficulty ratings of 6.5 and 5.6 in her first and second vault, respectively in the final round. North Korea’s Hong Un Jong, the 2008 Olympic champion and 2014 world champion on vault, could also be a threat. In fact, Biles upgraded her second vault to a Cheng to keep pace with Hong, who used it to beat Biles in previous years. Not to be outdone, Hong has been practicing a move that has never been executed in competition by a female gymnast: the triple-twisting Yurchenko, which is the Amanar plus an extra half twist. According to NBC’s Julia Fincher, Hong has submitted the triple-twisting Yurchenko at the 2013, 2014 and 2015 world championships, but never performed it in competition. If she can pull it off, not only would it reward her with a 6.8 difficulty rating, higher than Biles’s Amanar, it would become known as the Hong vault. But the vault is Biles’s weakest event — she took two silver medals and one bronze on vault at the last three world championships — and is the only apparatus on which she didn’t dominate at those competitions. According to Slate’s Dvora Meyers, Biles “attacks her skills with vigor, especially her dismount series,” on beam, often ending with a dismount so difficult that judges are likely to forgive minor imperfections. Russia’s Aliya Mustafina, the 2010 world all-around champion, had a more difficult beam and bar routine in the 2016 Russian Cup than Biles did at the P&G Championships, but she was edged by Biles on vault and floor for a higher total difficulty score. On floor, Biles has no equal. Her signature move, aptly known as “the Biles,” is one that few, if any, gymnasts dare to perform. “She flips backward with a straight body two times, and on the second flip, she does a half turn and she lands forward,” her coach, Aimee Boorman, explained to ABC News. “So she’s going backwards. She’s like arched backwards, and she flips and then starts her second flip. And before she finishes the second flip, she turns her body.” At the P&G Championship, Biles had a 6.8 difficulty on floor in both the preliminary and final rounds. Her closest competition that day was Aly Raisman with difficulty scores of 6.7 and 6.6, respectively, in the prelims and finals. No other competitor was higher than 6.5, and nine of the 14 women in the event had at least one floor routine with a difficulty rating of less than 6. In other words, if you want to beat Biles at the Olympics, you have to create one of the most difficult routines you can think of in addition to executing it at an elite level. Since her international competition debut in 2013 — she didn’t meet the minimum-age requirements for the 2012 Summer Games  — Biles has won 14 medals at the world championships, including 10 golds, and became the first woman since 1974 to win four consecutive all-around titles at U.S. nationals. She is also the first woman to be the all-around world champion three years in a row. Next up for Biles: hoping to make history as the first woman to win five gold medals in a single Games. And based on the difficulty of her routines, she’s got a good shot. sports fancy-stats Get the top Olympics news by email Major news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox as it happens. post_newsletter333 magnet-olympics2016 true endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.

First off, women CIOs at Intel Corp. are hardly a novelty. Tolliver succeeds Kim Stevenson, who served as the company's CIO for the past four years and who on Monday became COO of Intel's client and internet of things (IoT) businesses and systems architecture (CISA) group, its biggest revenue-generating division. The woman CIO thing at Intel doesn't stop there. Back in 2012, Stevenson took over the Intel CIO role from Diane Bryant, who went on to manage the company's data center group and in April was promoted from that group's general manager to its executive vice president. It's true the Intel CIO position wasn't filled by another woman from within the company. But the fact that Tolliver comes from the outside actually reinforces the argument that the high-profile hire is perhaps less about gender and more about business. Since taking over at Intel in 2013, CEO Brian Krzanich has broken from the company tradition of promoting from within to look outside for new talent. Notable recruits include Chief Marketing Officer Steven Fund, formerly at Staples and before that at Procter & Gamble; and CISA's president, Venkata "Murthy" Renduchintala, poached from Qualcomm a year ago and increasingly viewed as Intel's second in command. "Krzanich believes Intel needs to be re-energized through a number of avenues, one of which is that his senior staff represents a diversity of views from within and outside the company," said analyst Mark Hung, who covers wireless and IoT technologies for Gartner. "[Tolliver's] hiring definitely exemplifies that trend," he said. The icing on the women-in-high-tech-places news this week? Tolliver's CIO position at Dow Chemical was also filled by a woman: Dow IT veteran Melanie Kalmar. Glass ceilings breaking? Nah. Backward slide by women in tech To see the IT executive appointments at Intel and Dow as some sign that the notorious IT gender gap is rapidly closing would be, as many industry observers pointed out to me, a grave mistake. Not only do women remain grossly underrepresented in IT executive ranks, but the number of women preparing for such jobs is actually declining. Gartner, for example, based on its 2015 CIO Survey, estimated that just 14% of CIOs worldwide are women and pointed out that the figure has remained stagnant for the past 10 years. The 2016 Harvey Nash/KPMG CIO Survey put the current number of women in senior IT leadership roles even lower -- at just 9%, albeit up 3% from a year ago. In addition, young women are fleeing, not embracing, the computer sciences. In the past 30 years, the percentage of women graduates in computer sciences has declined from its peak in 1984 at 37% to just 18% today, according to Gartner. "It has gone down every year," said Debra Logan, a Gartner fellow who earned a master's degree in computer science in the mid-1980s and is puzzled by the trend. "Is it something that we choose, or is it something imposed from the outside, or both?" In any case, the CIO cohort remains notably monolithic, she said, especially in the U.S. and Western Europe, where the vast majority of CIOs are white men between the ages of 40 and 55. "There is not age diversity or gender diversity or racial diversity," said Logan, who is among a small contingent at Gartner now focused on the issue of IT diversity in the workforce. There's another point to be made about the Intel CIO appointment and the presence of women in executive IT roles, namely that the company is among the most committed in the technology industry to achieving diversity in the workforce. In 2014, Intel announced a $300 million diversity initiative "to accelerate diversity and inclusion" at Intel and across its network of suppliers. The company recently announced that it ended 2015 with 17.6% female representation in leadership, a 14.3% increase from 2014. The number of senior principal female engineers and fellows rose in 2015 to 21, up from 12 in 2014. And even those achievements come with an asterisk: As noted in a recent piece on Intel's diversity program by Davey Alba, Intel's goal of full representation of women among the company's technical workers is based on "market availability, or the percentage of women in the U.S. labor market overall who have the skills to fill available technical jobs" -- by Intel's estimation, 22.7%. By that measure, the 20.1% of Intel's technical jobs held by woman in 2015 -- a 5.8% increase over 2014 -- is approaching that goal. There is a skills gap. Never mind diversity, what about gender equality? The rather bleak outlook for women in IT is not lost on Carolyn Leighton, president and chairwoman of Women in Technology International (WITI). Leighton founded WITI in 1989 after working as a consultant with women technologists in California's Silicon Valley and hearing about some of their workplace frustrations. The organization -- which bills itself as the leading trade association for technology women, with chapters worldwide -- boasts some 2 million members. She shares Logan's puzzlement about the trend of women in technology. "In the last year, I've heard more stories [about women's experiences in Silicon Valley] similar to the very beginning when I started WITI than I had heard in years, and it was pretty upsetting and discouraging," she said. "There seems to be progress in terms of getting more women into C-level positions; on the other hand, there seems to be little organizational transformation going on in companies." Pressed, Leighton recounted one story of a Harvard-educated entrepreneur who, with one successful company already under her belt and looking for funding for a second startup, was grilled by Silicon Valley venture capital investors on when she was planning on getting pregnant. "I haven't quite figured out why this seems to be occurring." And, while a multimillion-dollar diversity program like Intel's is certainly laudable in its goal of making the tech industry more representative of the population, Leighton is among those who are deeply skeptical and, frankly, dismayed by the industry's habit of lumping women -- who, after all, represent 50% of the population and without whom none of the Silicon Valley male hotshots would exist -- into so-called diversity programs. "They are making policy around diversity and compliance, rather than as a business initiative and, in my opinion, missing an opportunity to recognize women as serious business contributors," Leighton said. "Most smart, well-educated, talented women find it offensive and insulting." Couple that approach with policies that give bonuses to managers for hiring women, she added, and "women walk into an environment where they're already doomed because the men are angry, and some are going to do everything they can to make sure they fail." Gartner's Logan concurred on the negative perception of diversity programs. "Particularly in America, that stuff rubs us the wrong way. Moreover, diversity, at that level, happens way too late," she said, pointing to the decline in women computer science graduates. "I don't want anyone to perceive me as anything other than 100% capable and competent to do the job, and these diversity programs don't seem to operate that way," she said. As for solutions, well, there are some interesting ideas afoot: Many companies are replacing diversity programs with inclusion programs, and there is talk of making institutional changes designed to support women with families. But that's a column for another day. In the meantime, who can tell what having a female as commander in chief could do for women in tech? CIO news roundup for the week of Aug. 1 The Intel CIO appointment wasn't the only tech news this week. Here's what else grabbed headlines: Bitcoin intrusion. Hong Kong-based Bitfinex, one of the world's largest bitcoin exchanges, suspended trading, withdrawals and deposits after it discovered hackers stole 119,756 bitcoins worth approximately $65 million from users' accounts. "We are currently in an ongoing process of restoring limited functionality in a secure environment, with full functionality coming afterwards in progressive stages," Bitfinex announced on the company's official blog. The security breach comes two months after Bitfinex was ordered to pay a $75,000 fine by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and is the biggest bitcoin hack since the 2014 hack of Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox. Hacks like these have highlighted the potential security issues related to the digital currency. HPE cloud reorganization. Bill Hilf, senior vice president and general manager of the Hewlett Packard Enterprise cloud business, is leaving HPE, the company announced in a blog post Monday. Helion OpenStack and Helion CloudSystem teams are being moved to the enterprise group, and they will be part of the newly created software-defined and cloud group. "By bringing these assets together, we create a single organization tasked with a common mission -- to provide best-in-class solutions that enable developers and operators to deploy their applications across traditional and cloud infrastructures, simply and effortlessly," Antonio Neri, executive vice president and general manager of the Hewlett Packard Enterprise group, said in the post. Two other executives, Manish Goel, the head of HPE's storage business, and Robert Vrij, managing director of sales for the Americas, are also exiting the company. The reorg follows the June announcement that HPE CTO Martin Fink is retiring. Amazon leads public cloud storage. Amazon Web Services, which generated $2.9 billion in second-quarter earnings, rules the infrastructure-as-a-service market, according to Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Public Cloud Storage Services, Worldwide report. AWS has the most extensive and well-integrated public cloud storage offerings, the report stated. "Amazon S3 [Simple Storage Service] is 1.6 times as large as all the other object storage services in this Magic Quadrant combined, as measured by amount of data stored," according to the report. Microsoft Azure is AWS' closest competitor, the report stated. Google, IBM, Rackspace, Alibaba, Oracle and AT&T also made the Gartner list. Gartner predicted that by 2019, at least one-fourth of these vendors will have exited the cloud storage market. Uber drives to map the world. In a move to minimize its dependence on Google Maps, San Francisco-based ride-sharing company Uber is investing in a $500 million project to map the world's roads, the Financial Times reported Sunday. "The street imagery captured by our mapping cars will help us improve core elements of the Uber experience, like ideal pick-up and drop-off points and the best routes for riders and drivers," said Brian McClendon, vice president of Uber's Advanced Technologies Center, in a statement. The Uber mapping cars are already on U.S. and Mexico roads. In other Uber news, chief executive Travis Kalanick said Monday that the company's China unit, Uber China, will merge with its Chinese rival Didi Chuxing in an attempt to cut losses.

Add My Comment Cancel   [-] iThinker2 - 10 Aug 2016 12:52 PM So, to reach the diversity goals is actually hiring and promotion of anyone other than a white male.  Who cares about ability and performance?  How do the women who have sons feel about this? Add My Comment Cancel   [-] RoyMMira - 10 Aug 2016 1:49 PM Linda, you're missing the forest for the trees.   The absolute majority of decisions made when  hiring and promoting are based on who is the best candidate to give more money into the pocket of who's hiring.   In the majority of these high management selection decisions, what matters is the "money creation" potential that the  hired or promoted person brings to the top , not prejudice against women or the so called "minorities" (which by the way are now quickly becoming the majority in this country, following the expected Nature's march towards reducing peaks and troughs of excellence all over the world).   If there has been inequality of race/gender representation  at high management and leadership within the past 10,000 years of humanity history,  it is in general due to Nature's unequal distribution of genes defining the traits that pool in onto selected or self made  leaders...   I am not one that could be at the  top command of hierarchies, but I'm not naïve  enough to immediately conclude that my limitations must be caused by discrimination.    Nature is what it is,  and distributes various physical and mental traits according to the environment and  gene pools,  which is to say, a lot of random variables are in the play.    But even random distributions have a defining probability function and over thousand of years, means and deviations appear for each region and racial groups which are not quite equal.   Of course they greatly overlap, but still, in sampling these slightly different distributions over longer periods of time, different results will appear for gender and race components at the hierarchy top.  Whoever you see more prevalent at the top, must be what is bringing more success to the endeavor.   Else, they'd be gone... or will in short term.    It may probably be why, you and me, are not in the chairman's room... Add My Comment Cancel   [-] RoyMMira - 10 Aug 2016 2:00 PM Great reply,  iThinker2 !  Managed to summarize what I could not in my full page that got rejected... Add My Comment Cancel   [-] iThinker2 - 10 Aug 2016 4:11 PM It is simple math.  When you look at the percentages in each category, the one that is too big is the white male category. To reach goals, one must reduce or not add to that category. Why are the categories by race? That is the problem.  Add My Comment Cancel   [-] abuell - 10 Aug 2016 1:35 PM Not even close to closed. Better than it has been in the past, maybe, but even that is questionable. Just the fact that someone feels the need to write an article about a woman CIO demonstrates that it's still considered an unusual and noteworthy thing. No one would write the same article about a male CIO.  Add My Comment Cancel   -ADS BY GOOGLE Latest TechTarget resources Compliance Health IT Cloud Computing Mobile Computing Data Center SearchCompliance Mitigating insider threats remains a major cyber concern Expert panelists at the Cambridge Cyber Summit briefed the audience on some of the steps that organizations should implement for ...

 Berkshire Hathaway earnings miss by $108 per share Akin Oyedele Aug. 5, 2016, 4:24 PM 4,977 facebook linkedin twitter email print Chip Somodevilla / Getty Berkshire Hathaway reported second-quarter earnings that showed a jump in net income and a miss on operating earnings per share. On Friday, the company headed by Warren Buffett reported operating earnings per share of $2,803 ($2,911 expected, according to Bloomberg) and net income of $5 billion, which rose 25% year-on-year. This year, Berkshire closed a deal to buy Procter & Gamble's Duracell, and entered an agreement to acquire Precision Castparts to add to its investments. Those transactions came as key businesses including BNSF Railway faced a slowdown in manufacturing and shipments. Berkshire's Class A shares closed up 1.4%, or $3,180, at $218,010 apiece on Friday.

"Following" : "Follow"}} August 05, 2016 10:46am   Comments Share: Related FRPT Freshpet's Biggest Challenge May Be That No One's Heard Of It The Market In 5 Minutes: More Twitter Rumors, Disappointing Employment Data Baird is bullish on the shares of Freshpet Inc (NASDAQ: FRPT) after its Q2 results show that velocity metrics heading in the right direction. "[W]e see further acceleration across 2H16 as new products hit shelves. While GM trends bear monitoring, FRPT still appears poised to deliver a material acceleration in EBITDA growth across 2H16 (helped in part by logistics savings)," analyst Peter Benedict wrote in a note. Velocity growth (as measured by weekly sales/average store) for the second quarter improved to 4.5 percent from first quarter 1.4 percent. Management continues to expect FY16 sales of greater than $137 million and FRPT-defined EBITDA greater than $18.5 million. Baird believes Freshpet is positioned to be one of the most compelling long-duration consumer growth stories in the market. It sees significant revenue and market share growth over time as brand awareness improves and retail distribution points continue to expand. Further, the company has named Billy Cyr (former CEO of Sunny Delight and Procter & Gamble executive) CEO effective early-September 2016. The analyst expects the veteran to bring "incremental relationships, operational discipline, and analytical rigor to the organization." "With valuation lagging CPG peers (~12x FY17E EBITDA vs. peers at ~16x), key drivers of our long-term thesis intact (disruptive/trend-right product, ample distribution growth runway, significant profit growth opportunity), and an industry veteran poised to join as CEO, we remain Outperform-rated with a $10 price target," Benedict noted. At time of writing, sahres of Freshpet surged 30.39 percent to $10.77.

Despite the controversy facing the Rio Olympics, 54% of American Millennial women plan to tune in. This survey reveals everything from the sports these women are most looking forward to watching, to their thoughts on the controversies surrounding the games, and the Team USA Olympians they follow on social media. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) and NBCUniversal can expect a record-setting year with the Rio Olympics beating the 2012 London Olympics as the most-watched event in US history. Despite the decline in live TV viewing amongst Gen Y, 75% of Millennial women plan to watch the Olympics on TV. A surprising 18% of Millennial women will be watching the Olympics through live streaming on NBCOlympics.com, while a staggering 75% will be tuning into the games on TV. The biggest motivation for them is supporting Team USA (51%), followed by their love of watching live sports (46%), wanting to be in-the-know since it's a major world event (37%), watching the opening and closing ceremonies (33%), the easy-to-follow programming of the event (19%), and supporting their favorite athletes (18%). When it comes to live programming, 71% of Millennial women plan to watch more live events than previous Olympic seasons because the USA and Rio are in similar time zones. This would seem to indicate that the unprecedented number of hours NBC has allocated for live programming will not go to waste. Not surprisingly, the most popular time frame for women in the Eastern time zone to tune in is 7-10PM (73%), as compared to 4-7PM for Central (64%), Mountain (63%) and Pacific time zones (54%). They plan to watch the Olympics a few times each week (45%). Only 7% indicated that they'd watch every single sporting event, while 30% plan to watch daily, and 18% plan to watch a few times throughout the whole event. Millennial women prefer TV over Social Media to stay updated on the games. When it comes to keeping up with the Olympics, Millennial women are bucking the current social-media-focused trends for traditional TV viewing -- 68% of them plan on staying up-to-date on the Olympics through television as compared to social media (63%), friends and family (33%), news websites (25%), the official NBCOlympics.com website (19%), radio (13%), and newspaper (7%). Interestingly, only 10% of them plan on using the official Olympics app to stay updated on the games -- a surprise given the popularity of app platforms among women in this highly connected generation. Facebook (67%) is still the winning social media platform for Millennial women to stay updated, followed by Instagram (51%), Twitter (41%), Snapchat (37%), YouTube (31%), Google+ (8%), Reddit (6%), and Periscope (3%). Surprisingly, 43% of Millennial women don't follow any athletes on social media. Of those who do follow sports stars, Michael Phelps (15%) is the most followed Team USA Olympian, gymnast Gabby Douglas comes in second (14%), and Serena Williams (13%), Ryan Lochte (7%), Kevin Durant (7%), Alex Morgan (6%), Aly Raisman (5%), Missy Franklin (5%), and Jordan Spieth (4%) also claim a Millennial following. Despite the buzz around Simone Biles -- currently lauded as perhaps the greatest gymnast of all time -- only 2% of Millennial women follow her on social media. That might change as soon as she rises to Olympic fame this August. Millennial women are optimistic: They predict Team USA will bring home 101 - 110 Olympic medals even though forecasts suggest we'll rake in 98 medals this year. After being shown Team USA's past Olympic medal counts (2012:104 medals)(2008:110 medals)(2004:103 medals) and being asked to guess the number of medals they think that we'd win this year, Millennial women guessed that we'd hit a similar range of medal count as in 2012. However, researchers from Rheinisch-Westfälisches Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung predict that USA will win 98 medals1 this year. Notably, artistic gymnastics (50%) ranks first among the top ten Olympic sports that Millennial women are most excited to watch. Swimming (44%) is unabashedly the runner-up, followed by rhythmic gymnastics (39%), diving (34%), trampoline gymnastics (30%), beach volleyball (26%), volleyball (19%), basketball (16%), synchronized swimming (14%), and football (13%). 88% of Millennial women reveal that they're more likely to watch sports that Team USA is competitive in and 61% of them are more interested in watching female athletes compete in certain sports more than others. China is viewed hands-down as the USA's biggest Olympic rival (55%). Despite the ban on Russia's track and field team from competing in the Olympics, they are still seen as a force to be reckoned with (49%). Other countries Millennial women view as formidable rivals include Germany (35%), Japan (29%), Great Britain (20%), France (15%), Australia (13%), South Korea (11%) and Italy (10%). 94% of millennial women think that Olympic athletes dope. With all the headlines that Rio has been making in recent months, we asked Millennial women what they thought of the most current and controversial issues surrounding the Olympics. While 57% of them were concerned about the super bacteria and sewage found in bodies of water where water sporting events will be held, 56% are concerned about safety at the Olympics, and 61% agree with the ban on the Russian Track and Field team from competing in the Olympics after failing doping tests. 48% of Millennial women were concerned about the Zika virus in Rio. Even more startlingly, 94% of Millennial women think that Olympic athletes dope. Of this group of Millennial women, 30% of them think that 1-19% of Olympic athletes dope, 34% of them think that 20-39% of athletes dope, 19% of them think that 40-59% athletes dope, 7% of them think that 60- 79% athletes dope, 1% of them think that 80-99% athletes dope, and 2% of them think that 100% athletes dope in the Olympics. Millennial women don't remember worldwide Olympics and Team USA sponsors very well. When given a list of brands, Millennial women were asked to identify the brands that they were absolutely sure are worldwide sponsors of the Olympics and Team USA. While Coca-Cola (59%), McDonald's (44%), Visa (26%), P&G (15%), and Samsung (15%) were the top five most recalled brand sponsors, women didn't fare as well recalling General Electric (4%), Bridgestone (2%), Omega (2%), Panasonic (2%), Dow (1%), and Atos (1%) as sponsors. In terms of brand endorsements, it's helpful to note that Millennial women are most likely to buy sports apparel (57%) if they saw an athlete wearing it. In that context, other products that they are more likely to buy include sports shoes (42%), sports drinks (37%), water bottles (29%), branded sports apparel e.g. Team USA jersey (25%), sports equipment (21%), and sports bags (13%). Looking forward to the 2024 Summer Olympics, almost half of Millennial women would like the games to return to the US. Of the four candidate cities bidding to host the 2024 Summer Olympics, Millennial women want the event to be held at Los Angeles in USA the most (44%), followed by Rome in Italy (19%), Paris in France (11%), and Budapest in Hungary (8%). 19% of them were indifferent. These are some of the key findings from an Influenster survey conducted from June 21-28th, 2016, with a total of 3,992 surveys completed involving a sample of 3,992 Millennial women across all ages (19-27:60%)(28-35:40%) with heavy social media usage (on 2+ social media channels:99%). Average age of respondent: 25. Minority reach: 39%. The survey was conducted online in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia.

classic | mobile Home | Subscribe | Contact   Nick Denbow's Industrial Internet report: The future for IoT Technews Industry Guide - Industrial Internet of Things 2016 There is a new trend evident in the presentations at conferences and corporate presentations, such as those organised by automation suppliers like Emerson and Yokogawa. Apart from the information about their new products, and new applications of their systems enabling better automation, these conference organisers also now offer a presentation from a ‘Trend-watcher’ or ‘Futurist’. Inevitably basing their arguments on the way technology has grown, in relation to computing power, mobile phones, and the Internet, these presentations try to explain the IoT (Internet Of Things) of today – to then discuss what the IoT will really provide, and what will be accepted as normal, in 10 years’ time. Trendwatcher Richard van Hooijdonk. Richard van Hooijdonk, a ‘Trendwatcher’ For the Yokogawa European conference, their Trendwatcher was Richard van Hooijdonk, from the Netherlands. A well-known radio lecturer, Richard is also a lecturer at the Nyenrode & Erasmus University (maybe they made a new subject area for him?). Entitled ‘Trends 2030’, his presentation linked the IoT with the growth of robots; with wearable and injected (into the body) electronics; with ‘Big Data’; with 4D printing and with cybercrime. Van Hooijdonk backs up what he says with his actions, at least enough to make us stop and think. He has had an RFID code implanted into his arm, which not only establishes his body with an IP address, but also provides the access code to the electronic lock on his apartment, so that he is recognised and the door is unlocked when he turns the doorknob. The unit also is programmed with the number for his Bitcoin account. While admitting that the injection process was not painless, his whole approach was that such technology will become smaller and cheaper, with future volume application. So the injections will be less painful, at least! Personal sensors vs robot automation Probably everyone in the audience understood and could relate to different parts of Richard’s view of the major future developments likely. Certainly I could understand the function of some wearable electronic systems that monitor heart rate, temperature and blood pressure, etc. But I lost the plot when this device was also bio-chemically analysing data from an internal pill or pills that circulate around and analyse the blood and other fluids, to look for symptoms or diseases that need treatment, and then automatically call the doctor! However, I could relate to the emphasis placed on robot automation, which particularly included advanced drones that can now use optical imaging to identify sections of fields or crops which need spraying with insecticide or seeds or fertiliser etc: the drones are self-programmed to fly over the field in a regular search pattern. Automated and self-checking robots for window cleaning, lawnmowers, carpet cleaning and floor polishing, litter picking and hoovering are all about to take over such manual jobs. Robotics will then take over other duties, like planting out seedlings and watering individual pots in garden centres. In the kitchen the fridge will know when it has run out of specific items like eggs, milk and butter, and order them automatically from the grocer, on a schedule. Relating this to IoT In terms of automation, the IoT offers the interlinking between multiple devices like pieces of home equipment. For example: the alarm clock rings, after having consulted your schedule, weather and traffic reports, to decide when you need to be awake: the curtains open, or alternately the lights are switched on, the bath is filled and the coffee pot or kettle switched on to brew a drink. But these actions may not have to be programmed, the devices themselves, and other sensors, will have been fed into a big ‘consequences’ database in the cloud somewhere, that uses pattern recognition to learn repeated sequences, and can then take over and run these sequences automatically. This ‘Big Data’ processing facility, using pattern recognition, creating artificial intelligence that can process all this data, is a necessary adjunct to the simple sensors – we can’t look at all that mass of information ourselves. Such data processing can be seen in a small way already, when the supermarkets collect your purchase pattern information, and uses this to predict when you will buy these same goods again. If you do not buy them when the computer thinks you should, it can send you a reminder, or even a special offer, to tempt you back to the store. Alternatively, look for a price for a flight on-line: suddenly adverts for that flight appear on every web page you access, and alongside your emails that mention keywords like ‘holiday’. Futurist Jack Uldrich. Jack Uldrich, a ‘futurist’ The Emerson European User Group conference on the other hand, brought Jack Uldrich over from the USA. Jack started life as a naval intelligence officer, and developed an ability to talk American almost as fast as my brain can translate the words being used. He now describes himself as a Futurist, and consults for many major investment groups, plus is a regular guest on CNN and CNBC. In his website (jackuldrich.com) he presents a paper describing the 10 ways IoT will 'Open up a Future of Opportunity'. Uldrich sees the alarm clock wake-up routine quoted above as the simplest use of IoT. A more comprehensive view is that sensors in your pyjamas, mattress, home lighting systems and the kitchen, monitor everything from your diet to your sleep pattern, and tell you to modify your behaviour to improve your lifestyle. For example, tell you to reduce the caffeine intake after 6pm, and tell your bedroom lights to get brighter as soon as you come out of REM sleep – whatever that is! I leave you to read the rest of the paper: but Uldrich takes IoT with Big Data as just one of the major triggers for change. The other factors he lists are social media, robotics, biotechnology, nanotechnology, AI and renewable energy, which will all coalesce to focus on the intelligent automation of our lives. New opportunities Uldrich sees some major business entrepreneurs emerging as a result of the technology changes around us already, identifying Spacex in satellite launchers – the re-useable ones that now land on ocean barges. Others include Tesla’s new designs of electric cars, and their plans to develop a 0,5 million units a year production facility for the required car batteries by 2020; GE producing 3D printed aero-engine parts (such as turbine blades) by 2020; and Deloitte recently moving into an office building in Amsterdam that can use IoT sensors to reduce energy consumption by 85%. Van Hooijdonk also pointed to disruptive new ideas overturning established markets, mentioning Uber in taxi services; BnB in renting holiday houses; Spotify in music; and Netflix in taking over the video rental market digitally. These Trendwatchers/Futurists do have a place in business. In fact, Van Hooijdonk teaches companies how to anticipate and deal with major changes that might disrupt their business, by creating their own internal disruption team. In this way, they may avoid the fate of Kodak, Blockbuster and Proctor & Gamble. There are obviously many profitable careers opening up in presenting trendwatching lectures, some forecasting IoT scenarios for the future. But what about the IoT? Gartner, a leading information technology research and advisory company, forecasts that 6,4 billion ‘things’ will be connected to the Internet by end 2016, up 30% from 2015, and that this number will reach 20 billion by 2020. These devices will generate a market for service spending of USD235 billion in 2016, so this spend will be approaching USD1000 billion worldwide by 2020. Admittedly, only around a third of these connections will be in business operations, two thirds will be in consumer areas. But the major market demand will be for services, where businesses employ external providers to design, install and operate their IoT systems. In reality, this means processing the information available using Big Data techniques, to allow the client to get on with his own business, yet benefit from new technology. “IoT services are the real driver of value in IoT, and increasing attention is being focused on new services by end-user organisations and vendors,” said Jim Tully, vice president and analyst at Gartner. So the attention Gartner speaks of can already be seen coming from the major automation suppliers, who are offering 24/7 services to analyse the data available from industrial Internet-based sensors, or from plant sensors connected over a VPN link via the Internet. The GE, Emerson and Yokogawa companies of this world see their customers using their products, but that these products have far more capability than the customer can absorb, so they need to be the supplier who provides the expansion and development services. Otherwise, someone else will jump in and pinch the client’s attention, and the work. So we already have GE supporting their aero-engines with wear and condition monitoring systems, then extending this to their compressors and pumps on LNG liquefaction plants, with teams of GE people monitoring and reporting back to their clients. These teams might only be in three or four places around the world, all linked by the Internet, but they can control their maintenance staff on site. These guys are directed to the machine or plant area that needs attention: and the whole contract is no longer measured in man hour charges, but in percentages of the plant output capability, when the equipment availability is maintained above X%. Similarly we see automation companies developing comparable contracts, where they use the IoT inputs to enable plant performance improvements, so that a South African plant (for instance) benefits from operational experience learned from a similarly linked up Canadian plant: and the payment is a proportion of the performance improvement. There are opportunities also for specialists to develop expertise in their own specific areas, e.g. for machine manufacturers to link all their own machines worldwide, and be the leaders in offering the most efficient, reliable widget production machinery: but eventually these will be linked into a major supplier of widget production and business services. The IoT benefit will come from collaboration and learning, matching patterns and experience and from knowledge gained elsewhere: it needs AI, which could be ‘Artificial Intelligence’ – or may be ‘Automated Intelligence’ – and it will come from Big Data, from multiple small sensors, interconnections, and collaboration!

Labor shortage solution: Adding women Fatima Hussein , fhussein@enquirer.com 12:42 p.m. EDT August 5, 2016 Buy Photo Barb Smith, president of Journey Steel, is photographed in front of the construction site at 8th and Sycamore in downtown Cincinnati. (Photo: The Enquirer/Carrie Cochran)Buy Photo Barb Smith knows the difficulties women face entering construction fields. Smith, the CEO of Roselawn steel fabrication company Journey Steel, has spent nearly three decades working for local companies before founding her own firm in 2009. For about the same amount of time, she has heard from critics of her skills, intellect or ability to manage large projects. "I was always told women and blacks couldn't specialize in engineering, but I always knew I was destined to be an engineer," Smith said, recalling her childhood. "My father always told me I had to work harder, faster and better than everyone around me.'" That determination worked for Smith and for women like her, being underrepresented in male-dominated industries from construction and manufacturing to computer science and engineering is nothing new. However, there's a big problem today that may push for those numbers to change – a growing labor shortage exacerbated by a fast-growing skills gap. The jobs in Greater Cincinnati with the greatest need for workers: construction, truck driving and the manufacturing also happen to be among the most heavily male-dominated positions, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Nontraditional or male-dominated occupations are those in which women represent 25 percent or less of the total number of workers employed, the federal agency said. Nationally, women fill about 3 percent of construction and extraction jobs and 4 percent of installation, repair and maintenance jobs and 15 percent of transportation jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Conversely, women fill jobs in the personal care, healthcare and educational occupations at clips of at least 73 percent. Labor economists say if more women were to land jobs in male-dominated fields, it could help narrow the gender pay gap, raise the earning power of women and increase economic development. However, longstanding issues like discrimination in the workplace, poor scheduling for working mothers and unsupportive family members have an impact on steering women away from sustaining long careers in fields such as engineering or construction. "We need to start looking at this from the perspective of, how can we be friendly to all employees, for the sake of improving the economy," said Janice Urbanik, a labor economist and executive director of the initiative that's managed by the United Way of Greater Cincinnati. There is hope. Officials from local group Partners for a Competitive Workforce say more girls are interested in pursuing and STEM – science, technology, engineering and mathematics – jobs in the future. It will likely take more than a few good women to keep the economy rolling, economists say. Breaking through barriers, even at the top As a black female chief executive working in the steel and construction industries, Smith doesn't have to think back very far to recall the last time she faced discrimination regarding her gender or race. "It happens to this day – even trying to get certified as a minority-owned business I was discriminated against," said Smith, whose firm employs about eight full-time workers and several part-timers depending on the size of a job. "I couldn't believe it when the person certifying me couldn't believe I was in charge. It makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up." Changing attitudes and debunking stereotypes among men is something Smith will continue working on. But another thing that has to change to engage more women – changing perceptions about the fields themselves. Buy Photo  (Photo: The Enquirer/Meg Vogel) "From an employer standpoint, there's a real shortage of workers to fill open positions," Urbanik said. "If women self-select out of those fields, or are told those fields are not for them, it reduces the talent pool by at least half." According to the Journal of Educational Research and Evaluation, young women choosing their careers have major concerns about whether male-dominated careers allow for balancing career and family. As a result, women may steer themselves away from certain occupations despite having the ability and ambition. Despite arguments that female-dominated fields such as teaching and nursing account for pay differences, a Cornell University study found that when women enter fields in greater numbers, their pay still falls when working jobs previously filled by men. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated women earn about 83 cents on average for every dollar earned by men, but that gap can vary widely depending on the occupation. The federal agency said women in construction jobs earned about 91 cents for every dollar, but was at 57 percent in the legal profession. Family members can also place hardship on women for their career choices. In an informal survey Partners for a Competitive Workforce recently completed, at least 30 percent of women eligible for job training in a male-dominated field experienced physical or emotional harassment or intimidation from loved ones as a result of their decision. "It's serious enough that we're commissioning a formal study on the topic," Urbanik said. ​​What is being done to fill the gap?  (Photo: Provided) Icy Williams, president of Atmos 360, a manufacturing firm with 45 employees in Greenhills, said employers should be more deliberate about finding female workers. Williams, a former Procter & Gamble manager, said the only way to get more women in the field is to talk about issues that make people uncomfortable. "We need to find ways in the business world, predominantly the white male-dominated business world, on how do we get a discussion going on around the real value that diversity brings and the impact that it is still having on us all," Williams said. Increasingly, companies are developing programs to encourage women and girls to enter STEM-related fields. Recently, employees at Norwood construction firm TriVersity participated in Rosie’s Girls, a program that introduces girls to STEM-related careers while building self-esteem and physical confidence in addition to interpersonal cooperation and leadership skills. CINCINNATI.COM Construction camp gives girls skills, grit Since 2008, more than 150 girls have learned carpentry, architecture, information technology and various other skills at the hands-on summer trades program offered by the YWCA of Greater Cincinnati and the National Association of Women in Construction. For women already in the workforce, the Raise the Floor program at Gateway Community and Technical College offers 12 months of training to obtain manufacturing skills certifications. Women who participate and complete the program can apply for a manufacturing job after just four months, according to the program's website. The program also helps with locating transportation and accessing childcare as well as job placement and career services. 284 CONNECTTWEET 38 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2aJoNmw TOP VIDEOS Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 22 17:46 Joe Deters asks for retrial of Ray Tensing, seeks change of venue 3:07 Black Friday secrets the stores don't want you to know 1:01 Finding home: A 12-year-old boy's search in the midst of war 6:41 Bills-Bengals postgame wrap 3:10 Bengals vs. Bills Week 11 predictions 6:02 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 15. 20:46 Supermoon rises over Cincinnati 0:55 Bengals vs. Giants wrap-up 3:15 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29 Jeff Ruby: 'I sense there is not going to be justice' for the DuBose family 2:18 Deters on Tensing crying on the stand: ‘The place to be upset... was after you just blew someone's brains out' 26:55 Defense makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 41:26 Prosecution makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 26:35 Tensing: 'Oh my God, he's going to run me over, he's going to kill me' 12:03 Use-of-force expert: 'The actions of Ray Tensing were justified' 0:50 Which stores are opening, closing Thanksgiving Day 0:34 \u0022I can't wait to see Tensing on the stand\u0022 0:55 Cincinnati Police Criminalist: Tensing 'seemed nervous or afraid' 2:59

Facebook Giveaways Contest Rules Photos Contact Select Page S&P 500 y Nasdaq tocan máximos históricos y Dow Jones sube más de 150 puntos Posted by Online News Editor | Aug 5, 2016 BOLSA WALL STREET Nueva York, 5 ago (EFE).- Wall Street ampliaba las ganancias y a media sesión dos de sus principales indicadores, el selectivo S&P 500 y el índice compuesto del mercado Nasdaq, se situaban en máximos históricos, mientras que el Dow Jones subía más de 150 puntos. El S&P 500 subía a esta hora un 0,82 % hasta 2.182,05 puntos, por encima de su último récord histórico fijado en 2.175,03 enteros, mientras que el Nasdaq progresaba un 1,14 % hasta 5.225,23 unidades, también por encima de su máximo histórico de 5.218,86 unidades. Por su parte, el Dow Jones de Industriales avanzaba hacia mitad de la jornada un 0,89 % (162,99 puntos) y se ubicaba en 18.515,04 unidades, cada vez más cerca de su récord histórico fijado en 18.595,03 unidades. Hacia el ecuador de la jornada los operadores en el parqué neoyorquino seguían apostando decididamente por las compras impulsados por el buen sabor de boca que dejó en Estados Unidos el informe oficial de empleo publicado por el Departamento de Trabajo. La tasa de desempleo se mantuvo en julio en el 4,9 %, con una fuerte creación de 255.000 nuevos puestos de trabajo que superó ampliamente las expectativas de los analistas, que como el mes anterior volvieron a quedarse cortos en sus previsiones. Los datos reafirman el buen momento del mercado laboral, que ha creado más de diez millones de empleos desde el fin de la recesión en 2009, y refuerza los argumentos para que la Reserva Federal (Fed) suba los tipos de interés más pronto que tarde. Casi todos los sectores cotizaban al alza, como el financiero (1,32 %), el tecnológico (1,09 %), el industrial (0,93 %), el energético (0,55 %) o materias primas (0,22 %), mientras bajaba el de empresas de servicios públicos (-0,62 %) o el sanitario (0,26 %). La farmacéutica Merck lideraba las ganancias entre la inmensa mayoría de los treinta valores del el Dow Jones, con una fuerte subida del 7,52 %, por delante de JPMorgan (2,46 %), American Express (2,43 %), Goldman Sachs (2,08 %) o Nike (1,81 %). También subían más de un punto porcentual Apple (1,65 %), Intel (1,30 %), Caterpillar (1,15 %) o Microsoft (1,00 %) mientras que al otro lado de la tabla solo bajaban Verizon (-0,46 %), Chevron (-0,19 %) y Procter & Gamble (-0,02 %). En otros mercados, el petróleo de Texas bajaba a 41,57 dólares, el oro retrocedía a 1.344,7 dólares la onza, la rentabilidad de la deuda pública a diez años avanzaba al 1,566 % y el dólar ganaba terreno frente al euro, que se cambiaba a 1,1082 dólares.

Por su parte, el Dow Jones de Industriales avanzaba hacia mitad de la jornada un 0,89 % (162,99 puntos) y se ubicaba en 18.515,04 unidades, cada vez más cerca de su récord histórico fijado en 18.595,03 unidades. Hacia el ecuador de la jornada los operadores en el parqué neoyorquino seguían apostando decididamente por las compras impulsados por el buen sabor de boca que dejó en Estados Unidos el informe oficial de empleo publicado por el Departamento de Trabajo. La tasa de desempleo se mantuvo en julio en el 4,9 %, con una fuerte creación de 255.000 nuevos puestos de trabajo que superó ampliamente las expectativas de los analistas, que como el mes anterior volvieron a quedarse cortos en sus previsiones. Los datos reafirman el buen momento del mercado laboral, que ha creado más de diez millones de empleos desde el fin de la recesión en 2009, y refuerza los argumentos para que la Reserva Federal (Fed) suba los tipos de interés más pronto que tarde. Casi todos los sectores cotizaban al alza, como el financiero (1,32 %), el tecnológico (1,09 %), el industrial (0,93 %), el energético (0,55 %) o materias primas (0,22 %), mientras bajaba el de empresas de servicios públicos (-0,62 %) o el sanitario (-0,26 %). La farmacéutica Merck lideraba las ganancias entre la inmensa mayoría de los 30 valores del el Dow Jones, con una fuerte subida del 7,52 %, por delante de JPMorgan (2,46 %), American Express (2,43 %), Goldman Sachs (2,08 %) o Nike (1,81 %). También subían más de un punto porcentual Apple (1,65 %), Intel (1,30 %), Caterpillar (1,15 %) o Microsoft (1,00 %), mientras que al otro lado de la tabla solo bajaban Verizon (-0,46 %), Chevron (-0,19 %) y Procter & Gamble (-0,02 %). En otros mercados, el petróleo de Texas bajaba a 41,57 dólares, el oro retrocedía a 1.344,7 dólares la onza, la rentabilidad de la deuda pública a diez años avanzaba al 1,566 % y el dólar ganaba terreno frente al euro, que se cambiaba a 1,1082 dólares.
