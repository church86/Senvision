Returns to Growth The consumer-goods titan delivered organic sales growth across all of its major business divisions. Joe Tenebruso (TMFGuardian) Oct 27, 2016 at 4:46PM Image source: Procter & Gamble. Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) reported fiscal 2017 first-quarter results on Oct. 25. The owner of brands such as Gillette razors and Crest toothpaste enjoyed a rebound in sales growth, as well as solid profit and cash flow generation. What happened with Procter & Gamble this quarter? Organic sales -- which exclude the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions, and divestitures -- rose 3%. The growth was broad-based, with organic sales increasing in all five of P&G's business segments. And, importantly, P&G's sales growth was driven mostly by higher shipment volumes, rather than price increases, which signifies increasing demand for P&G's products. Foreign currency movements did, however, weigh on Procter & Gamble's results. These currency fluctuations reduced sales by 3 percentage points, which is why P&G's reported revenue was essentially flat year over year at $16.5 billion. Profitability also continues to improve. On a currency-neutral basis, "core" (a measure that adjusts for restructuring and other non-recurring charges) gross margin and operating profit margin increased 130 basis points and 120 basis points, respectively, mainly due to productivity cost savings. That helped constant-currency core earnings per share, which rose 12% to $1.10. "Our first quarter results mark a good start to the fiscal year," said Chairman and CEO David Taylor in a press release. "We delivered broad-based organic sales growth improvement across product categories and markets, as well as strong cost savings." Cash flow and capital returns Importantly, Procter & Gamble's cash flow generation remains strong, with first-quarter operating cash flow exceeding $3 billion and free cash flow surpassing $2.3 billion. The company remains committed to passing this cash on to shareholders, as demonstrated by the $1 billion of share repurchases and $1.9 billion in dividend payments that P&G conducted during the quarter. Looking forward Procter & Gamble reiterated its full-year fiscal 2017 guidance, including all-in sales growth of approximately 1%. Organic sales are still expected to increase 2%, with foreign exchange and minor-brand divestitures projected to reduce sales by 1%. Procter & Gamble also maintained its outlook for "mid-single digits" core earnings-per-share growth, compared to fiscal 2016 core EPS, of $3.67. "Earlier this month, we completed the last major step in P&G's portfolio transformation with the Beauty Brands divestiture to Coty Inc.," added Taylor. "We are now focusing all our efforts on 10 large, structurally attractive categories where P&G holds leading positions. We're pleased with the progress we're making, but there is still more work to do to get back to the levels of balanced top- and bottom-line growth and cash generation that will consistently put P&G shareholder value creation among the best in our industry." That top-line growth will be vital if Procter & Gamble is to deliver market-beating returns to investors going forward, as cost-cutting can only go so far. Management's commitment to funneling cost savings into increased marketing and innovation-focused investments should help in that regard, as should P&G's more streamlined brand and organizational structure. Still, sales growth will remain an uphill challenge for P&G due to tepid global growth in the packaged consumer goods industry as a whole, as well as increasing competition, particularly in the e-commerce space. As such, Procter & Gamble, with its 3% dividend yield, is likely a better choice for those seeking a relatively stable income-producing investment, rather than for those looking for growth.

Management Wants You to Know Executives recently opened up about why growth was so solid last quarter and the major challenges ahead that P&G is facing. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Oct 27, 2016 at 11:17AM Image source: Getty Images. No business is too large or too widely followed to surprise investors from time to time. Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), the $240 billion consumer goods giant, jumped higher this week after posting strong revenue growth to kick off its new fiscal year. Organic sales improved by 3% to mark the company's best result on that metric in over two years. After the earnings announcement, CFO Jon Moeller held a conference call with analysts to chat about the market-moving results. Here are some key investor takeaways from that discussion. Building momentum Organic sales grew in each region and in nine of the 10 largest markets. P&G managed several important wins this quarter. Growth improved overall to a 3% pace from 2% last quarter and 1% in the previous quarter. Those gains were broad based, as they included improvements across all markets and every product category. The U.S. was an especially strong geography at 3% growth. The fabric care division, anchored by Tide detergent, turned in the best individual showing at 5% gain. P&G didn't need to rely on price hikes to get those higher revenue results, either. It enjoyed strong volume growth even as rival Unilever saw its sales volumes turn lower. Soft spots We still have work remaining in some categories and markets to get our brands back to market levels of growth. There were plenty of stumbles this quarter, though. P&G lost share in two of its largest categories, hair care and baby care. It also took a step backwards in China, Russia, and the U.K., which it described as a "challenging and highly promotional market." The challenges aren't getting easier from here. Moeller said P&G is seeing geopolitical and economic volatility in areas like Egypt, Nigeria, Argentina, and the Philippines, all while competitors keep targeting its most profitable niches. P&G lost market share overall last year, and that trend could continue over the current fiscal year, even if the declines are slightly smaller. The portfolio we want This marks the completion of the most significant portfolio transformation in P&G's history. With its multibillion-dollar sale of beauty brands to Coty, P&G effectively finished its portfolio redesign. The company now owns about 100 fewer franchises, and so should be much easier to manage. Image source: P&G. There should be significant financial payoffs from the transformation as well. The brands that are left are growing at about 1 percentage point faster and with profit margins that are 2 percentage points higher than the company average. P&G chose these because the company has structural advantages with them such as dominant market share and favorable relationships with retailers. Cost savings We're driving productivity improvement up-and-down the income statement, and across the balance sheet. You might think that, after years of slicing billions of dollars out of its cost structure, P&G would have already picked all the low-hanging fruit in terms of shedding expenses. However, if anything, the company sees more opportunity ahead to boost productivity. After saving $1.4 billion per year in cost of goods in each of the last five fiscal years, management believes it can save as much as $2 billion per year through fiscal 2021. PG cost of goods sold (TTM) data by YCharts. The funds are being plowed back into initiatives that support long-term growth, including research and development, marketing, and trial-building programs. Cash is coming Fiscal 2017 will be a year of significant value returned to share owners. Thanks to its incredible cash efficiency, there's routinely plenty of money left over for investors even after executives make prudent investments in the business. This year, that math is kicked into overdrive, though, as the company raised billions of excess funds from its portfolio-shedding initiative. Management plans to spend $7 billion on dividends and nearly $15 billion on stock buybacks. Put it all together and P&G will send $22 billion to shareholders this year. That's up dramatically from its recent $15 billion annual average and enough to qualify as one of the biggest capital return plans on the market.

"Ultimately it's about winning the consumer value equation, it's working with our customers and working very hard to create and build categories as the key driver of growth, because if we do that, it's a very sustainable strategy," P&G Chairman and CEO David Taylor told CNBC. Taylor took the helm at P&G, best known for brands like Tide detergent and Pampers diapers, one year ago. The company has streamlined its portfolio in an effort to return to growth, but Taylor told CNBC in an interview that new products are also helping to drive the firm's turnaround. "If you go back 10 years ago, car air fresheners was a very small, quiet category. We introduced something called Febreze car, and it is now a quarter-billion-dollar business that's growing nicely." P&G's efforts to offer innovative new products is how, Taylor said, the firm will win market share in the U.S. and abroad. "I believe very much that it will come down ultimately to innovation that builds categories, and if we do our job better than others, we'll get a little bit of share growth. I don't subscribe to the zero sum game that says it's only about whether we can take from someone else." show chapters <p>P&amp;G CEO: Our growth brands</p> <p>Procter &amp; Gamble CEO David Taylor talks to CNBC&#039;s Sara Eisen about transformation at P&amp;G.</p> P&G CEO: Our growth brands    Thursday, 27 Oct 2016 | 5:38 AM ET | 02:25 Despite growth in all of P&G's product categories, beauty is not doing as well as the others. Taylor attributes some of that to changing consumer behaviors. Gillette is one of P&G's brands that has suffered, as facial hair has become more trendy. "There is a societal trend in many countries of more facial hair, and that's not great for Gillette. Although we also play in both wet and dry. We have Braun and we have Gillette, so there's a lot of trimming jobs to be done and we've got products to deal with that," Taylor explained. Other categories are seeing massive growth. The consumer product giant's Always discreet brand of adult diapers is its fastest growing product, and Taylor said the brand has allowed P&G to reach a whole new demographic.

How Mature Are We in Engaging Customers in New Ways? CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT Oct 27, 2016 Peter Manos, Market Strategist | T&D World Magazine EMAIL Tweet Comments 1 One measure of interest is available in some cold hard numbers-- the level of revenue from electricity sales by retail power marketers. Another measure of interest is the ongoing growth in Distributed Energy Resources (DERs). Advertisement How mature are we, as an industry, when it comes to our efforts to engage with customers in new ways?  One measure of interest is available in some cold hard numbers-- the level of revenue from electricity sales by retail power marketers.  While the associated number of customers is still relatively low, the electric revenue of retail power marketers in the last fully reported year now exceeds of the total for municipal or cooperative utilities, per the chart below, derived from EIA data: Another measure of interest is the ongoing growth in Distributed Energy Resources (DERs).  DER trends matter because they are in the process of changing our world—nothing less.  Several key needs come to the forefront: We need to elevate and share the insights and struggles of those who are actually doing real work enabling integration of DERs on the grid; We need to provide actionable analyses and views that help inform our path forward, with a reliable foundation, one that aligns the horizontal of what’s next with the vertical of our ideals; We need a foundation that stays balanced.  One as tech-savvy as it is market savvy.  One that will make as much sense from an engineering economics perspective as from a policy, customer-centric, and regulatory one. Consider this fact: More is spent annually in the U.S. on advertising 10 popular personal care brands ($1.9 billion) than what is spent by all U.S. electric utilities, combined, on advertising. Proctor & Gamble’s overall advertising budget, shown below, has been averaging between 7.7% and 8.1% of the company’s recent annual revenue, which has ranged between $89 billion and $102 billion over the last four years.   How does P&G’s spending 8% of revenue on advertising compare to electric utility rates of ad spend?  The average utility spends 20 times less! Yes. The 201 utilities reporting to FERC last year showed total electric revenue of $271 billion yet their total advertising spend was just $1 billion: We can adjust these results and create a rough estimate based on the distribution of utilities in the U.S. overall, per the recent EIA data summarized below: The 201 large utilities reporting to FERC represent 69% of total U.S. electric sales revenue.  A sampling of meeting minutes and reports from a number of munis and cooperative utility reports shows similar levels of advertisement related spending.  In addition, the same analysis for historic data from FERC between 1996 and 2013 shows little change. The muni and coop spend, along with indirect advertising through fees to national or regional organizations as well as sales and customer related expenses that may indirectly involve some goodwill being created, could perhaps double or even quadruple these figures, but even if we made these figures ten times larger, they’d still be ten times too small to do much—we are talking about addressing 100 million electric utility customers, and annually, the debate is not about whether we should double or triple the current one dollar per customer, but whether multiplying by ten or twenty will do. The complexities of retail markets involve a share of risk which some large IOUs may have been wise to steer away from, while others in more favorable markets may have managed well by working through subsidiaries that have been embracing it.   Consider the size of some of the big players in the Retail Power Marketer segment.  Each of the following eleven Retail Power Marketers reported more than $1 billion in U.S. electric sales revenue to EIA last year: Retail Power Marketers Reporting More than $1 billion in Annual U.S. Sales: Constellation NewEnergy TXU Energy Retail Direct Energy Business Reliant Energy Retail Services First Energy Solutions Corporation Just Energy Suez Energy Resources North America Noble Americas Energy Solutions Direct Energy Constellation Energy Services Ambit Energy Holdings Consolidated Edison Solutions How do such companies compare when it comes to their spend on advertising?  While it is not an apples-to-apples comparison, and not all such companies are publicly traded, data from the Annual Report of one of them (Just Energy—per page 91 of this link) showed a 19% spend on Sales and Marketing in its FY 2015 ($225 million out of a $3.8 billion revenue figure). Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Discuss this Article 1 William G Jackson Jr on Oct 28, 2016 It would seem reasonable that utility advertising budgets would be significantly less than that of multi-national companies. Also, including customer service type expenses, like promotion of website services should also be considered. An excellent article that actually supports the customer-smart use of revenues by utilities. reply Log In or Register to post comments Post new comment Name: Sign In or register to use your TDWorld ID Email: Your comment: * Advertisement Related Articles BGE Engages Customers Wholesale Markets Meet Demand Response Ontario Implements Demand Response Demand-Response Efforts Grow A New Breed of Cooperative Connect Advertisement Latest News Nov 17, 2016 Humor T&D World Magazine Crossed Wires: Rural Circuits 1 Check in with Hinterland Electric's mobile command....More Nov 16, 2016 User Submitted Content Grid Optimization What is the Most Frequent Cause of Outages? 2 The most important metric in the power industry is the percentage of time we keep the lights on....More Nov 16, 2016 News TVA to Sell Bellefonte Nuclear Plant Nuclear Development has entered into a contract to purchase the partially completed Bellefonte Nuclear Plant from the Tennessee Valley Authority...More Nov 16, 2016 News ABB and Aibel to Partner on Offshore Wind Connections ABB and Aibel have announced a partnership to deliver offshore wind integration solutions....More Latest on T&D How™ Oct 13, 2016 Education T&D World Magazine Where Can You Go with T&D HOW Videos?

Big names, big checks behind Cincy school levy Hannah Sparling , hsparling@enquirer.com 5:17 p.m. EDT October 28, 2016 Buy Photo Hope Johnston-Holm of Pleasant Ridge gathers campaign signs at the Issue 44 campaign headquarters in Walnut Hills. (Photo: The Enquirer/Kareem Elgazzar)Buy Photo Scroll to the bottom of this story to read the finance reports.  If the Cincinnati Public Schools/Cincinnati Preschool Promise levy fails this Election Day, it won’t be for lack of big-name backing. Nor for lack of big checks. Recent campaign finance reports show the Issue 44 team has raised about $1.26 million to make its pitch to voters. That’s more than 10 times as much as the last successful new-money campaign for CPS in 2008. Donations then to the main campaign committee totaled around $117,000, according to board of elections records. There are seven Hamilton County school levies on the ballot this election, and the other six campaigns are working with just over $5,000 to just over $31,000 each. That’s not necessarily apples-to-apples, because big-city schools generally tend to play with more – more students, more money, bigger campaigns. But, it demonstrates how other school campaigns are faring this year. Issue 44 campaign director Brewster Rhoads said the amount raised depicts the breadth of support behind the levy. People believe in CPS schools, Rhoads said – as evidenced by growing enrollment – and they believe in preschool. It's a chance to cut child poverty and increase the number of qualified, ready-to-work graduates, Rhoads said. It’s a chance to spend more on education now but less on incarceration later. “You have a chance to make dramatic and rapid progress,” he said. “It’s exciting. … But we don’t take anybody’s vote for granted. We’re just working our tails off.” It is a $48 million a year, five-year levy. If it passes, it will cost homeowners in the CPS district an extra $278 a year for each $100,000 of home value. Worthy of note in the financial filing: The biggest donation is a $200,000 check from the United Way of Greater Cincinnati Foundation. The United Way has deep ties to the levy, though; if it passes, United Way will be in charge of forming a new nonprofit to oversee the $15 million a year preschool expansion.  The Greater Cincinnati Foundation gave $125,000 and Cincinnati Children's Hospital gave $30,000.  The report is peppered with local businesses. Procter & Gamble gave $175,000, for example. Kroger Co. and Cintas Corp. gave $30,000 each. And Fifth Third Bancorp, Western & Southern Financial Group and PNC Financial Services Group each chipped in $50,000. There are a lot of powerful Cincinnatians on the list. Frances Pepper, the wife of retired P&G chairman John Pepper, donated $25,000. Reds owner Robert Castellini and the Castellini Co. LLC donated $25,000. Councilman Chris Seelbach gave $44. The business community clearly wants this levy to pass, evidenced by its big, lucrative push. But there are still opponents: those who do not think CPS is doing a good job with the funds it already has, those who worry about pass-on costs to the same poor families this levy is supposed to help and those who, quite simply, do not want higher taxes. Board of elections records only go back six years, but in 2002, CPS ran a bond issue that failed, Rhoads said, and the budget for that was about $750,000. So, adjusting for inflation, the $1.26 million raised this year is not a crazy amount. The 2008 victory was during a presidential primary rather than a general election. Voter turnout will be much higher this time around, and that is likely good for the Issue 44 team. But, Rhoads said, it also means more people to reach with their message – more door-to-door canvassing, more rallies, more yard-signs, more phone banking. And that, he said, means more money. 5 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2eUKAKP TOP VIDEOS La Salle wins regional championship 0:55 911 call: I'm being attacked by bear; I'm going to die 1:05 Joe Deters: \u0022I didn't believe the tears for a second\u0022 2:47 Are deals better on Black Friday or Cyber Monday? 1:00 Bengals vs. Bills Week 11 predictions 6:02 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 15. 20:46 Supermoon rises over Cincinnati 0:55 Bengals vs. Giants wrap-up 3:15 Student at UC Tensing forum: 'It's time for war' 0:45 Sam DuBose sister: 'This, to me, is murder' 1:30 Protests in Cincinnati after Ray Tensing mistrial 1:09 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Mistrial declared in Ray Tensing case 3:46 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Most touching ways soldiers reunited with their family 1:17 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29 Jeff Ruby: 'I sense there is not going to be justice' for the DuBose family 2:18 Deters on Tensing crying on the stand: ‘The place to be upset... was after you just blew someone's brains out' 26:55 Defense makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 41:26 Prosecution makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 26:35 Donald Trump's unlikely path to presidency 2:01 More Stories What are the questions Tensing jurors asked during deliberations?

He added, "Many of the best success stories of P&G is innovation that identified a need ... provided a better way to do something that allowed the category to grow. ... In many different segments premium and super premium items, if they delight the consumer, will cause the consumer to invest more in that category." He also discussed: Taking over as CEO a year ago. Health and beauty products. China and emerging markets. Importance of free trade. Advertising on social media. Prior to becoming CEO, Taylor was group president of P&G's Global Beauty, Grooming and Health Care sectors, which included leading brands such as Crest, Head & Shoulders and Olay.

TBWA\ Africa kicks ‘Disruption’ up a notch. Alliance Media partners with Botswana for 50th. This week’s BIG move: TBWA\Durban sweetens up with acquisition of SUGAR The Agency In a sweet deal that has seen it double its digital capability overnight, TBWA\Durban acquired SUGAR The Agency (SUGAR), a smaller operation in KwaZulu-Natal’s capital city that has positioned itself as a significant player in the digital space over the past six years. Sean Donovan, TBWA\Durban managing director, says acquiring SUGAR was aimed at increasing TBWA\Durban’s digital capacity, allowing it to become more media agnostic. “We have been building our digital capability organically over the past few years. By getting the SUGAR team on board, we were able to increase our digital team twofold from about 12 to 25 people.” Warren Haviside, former partner and executive creative director of SUGAR and now head of the TBWA\Durban digital team, says SUGAR was originally established in 2010 as a through-the-line agency to offer clients fresh ideas and quick turnaround times. “Our size meant we were agile enough to stake our claim in the digital space when digital campaigns became more sought-after.” The entire SUGAR team and its portfolio of clients such as Jägermeister SA, Jägermeister Pan-Africa, Corona Beer, AFGRI, Bidvest Insurance, Ignite Charcoal, Stella Artois, Calgro Developments, Xpanda Security and R&B Timbers, amongst others, has moved to TBWA\Durban’s offices. Who’s moved where Themba Nobanda appointed client service director for Dentsu Aegis Network SSA  Dentsu Aegis Network has announced the appointment of Themba Nobanda, as client service director for Dentsu Aegis Network Sub-Saharan Africa. Nobanda joins the company after successfully setting up and running his own business in the golf industry called Golf4Fun. His business has seen over 1000 people being introduced to golf after 24 months of operation. With over 10 years’ experience in the marketing industry, he is a seasoned ex Diageo and P&G client in the region and has worked across sub Saharan Africa. Under his leadership at Diageo, Uganda Spirits Brands were rated Best Business Plan in Africa in 2014 and created a World Record of 1000 Bottles of Johnnie Walker Sold in one event (Forbes Celebration Dinner). Ahmed Tilly joints FCB Joburg in powerful new creative partnership FCB Joburg has taken a strategic decision to further bolster its creative product by bringing the highly respected and awarded Ahmed Tilly into the agency to partner executive creative director, Jonathan Deeb, in a joint chief creative officer leadership team. Making the announcement, FCB Africa’s Group CEO and group chief creative officer, Brett Morris, said the decision was on the back of FCB Joburg’s outstanding growth, having more than doubled in size over the past three years. Tilly, co-founder and ECD of Black River FC and previously creative director at The Jupiter Drawing Room Cape Town and TBWA, would be joining forces with Deeb to further enhance the agency’s creative product. “This formidable new partnership will be responsible for the overarching creative vision of the agency, driving transformation and developing young talent. Welcome, Ahmed,” said Morris. Fahmida Miller appointed Al Jazeera’s East Africa correspondent Fahmida Miller joined Al Jazeera in 2015, originally working out of the network’s Johannesburg bureau. She’s covered major stories across Africa, from the Libyan revolution to death of Nelson Mandela, but is equally at home presenting current affairs and lifestyles programmes. She’s interviewed the likes of Rwandan president Paul Kagame and former South African president Thabo Mbeki, and covered stories like the student protests in South Africa and the ongoing drought in the region. Miller previously worked at CCTV Africa, eNCA, SABC, and Kaya FM. Who’s won what  Influencer Relations: Clockwork Media partners with Webfluential Clockwork Media is set to help brands edge just a little closer to their audiences through its recently announced partnership with Webfluential, a platform connecting brands to online influencers. The partnership with Webfluential will allow Clockwork to better serve its portfolio of clients by giving them access to powerful influencer marketing. “We’ve always been focused on producing great content and pushing it through the right channels to achieve a desired result,” says Tom Manners, MD of Clockwork Media. “At the same time, we’re passionate about introducing and embracing new technology within the agency. It’s obvious that influencer marketing has become a major force within the marketing mix globally. As the world of communications continues to evolve it makes sense that agencies evolve with it.” Webfluential, another proudly South African tech start-up, has seen massive global growth since launching in 2013, and now boasts some of the world’s top businesses as clients, including Coca-Cola, Vodacom, Shell and P&G. The platform allows brand marketers to search for relevant influencers with the perfect audience for their products to boost their online reach. MobiMedia ups the game! Mobile marketing agency, MobiMedia, a division of the Ole! Media Group, has been appointed the exclusive mobile content partner for Africa for Cartoon Network’s Games portal. In addition, MobiMedia has also acquired the rights to animated video content geared towards younger mobile users from its global gaming partner with whom the company has also signed a sole distribution license. Under its Planet Games platform, MobiMedia is able to offer literally thousands of mobile games, apps, images, ringtones, and more, to over 20 000 different smartphone, feature and tablet devices to suit a number of different operating systems, including a range of over 100 HTML5 games.  The offering also includes 22 Cartoon Network games that have never been published before, marking a first for South Africa. Penny Siopis named ACT Lifetime Achievement winner Visual artist Penny Siopis was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award for her contribution to the arts at the 19th annual Arts & Culture Trust (ACT) Awards, held at Sun International’s The Maslow Hotel in Johannesburg on Friday, 21 October. Since 1975, Siopis has been exhibiting both locally and internationally. She says she is thrilled to have received this Award. “It is a wonderful recognition of my creative work, as an artist, but also a teacher.” Currently an Associate Professor in Fine Arts at UCT’s Michaelis School of Fine Art and the chairperson of the department’s governing committee, Siopis’ advice to young artists is to be committed to their beliefs but also be open to the world around them. “Take risks. Be resilient. Don’t be afraid to show your vulnerabilities,” she says. Who’s making moves Emlo introduces PR programme for interns The public relations industry is in need of new, and young, blood if it wants to keep up with the always changing trends in the world of communication. Being such a fast-paced industry it is often difficult for young graduates to secure their first job due to a lack of work experience. A PR internship programme will help solve this challenge.  “With South Africa’s unemployment rate sitting at 26,6% (Stats SA, July 2016) the responsibility to give students an opportunity to gain practical, industry-related experience lies with business owners,” says Marisa Louw, founder and managing director of Emlo. Although the agency is still in its infancy, Louw’s passion for developing young talent has led to the inception of the PR internship programme that will help students gain first-hand experience of the world of PR in an environment that is busy enough to help them grow as young PR professionals but not yet as fast-paced as the more established agencies in which they often feel overwhelmed. Undergraduates and graduates who would like to pursue a career in public relations are welcome to forward their CVs a to marisa@emlopr.co.za to apply for the PR internship programme.  Emlo is a member of the Public Relations Consultants’ Chapter (PRCC) and being a student member of the Public Relations Institute of Southern Africa (PRISA) will be an advantage for applicants. BBC Worldwide channels listed in Loeries official ranking. BBC Worldwide’s entertainment channels have been named as one of the top 20 brands in the prestigious Loeries Official Rankings 2016. The recognition is based on the local creative work that the brand has implemented in South Africa over the last 12 months to reach out to local audiences and introduce new viewers to the BBC’s award winning portfolio of content. It follows the news that the marketing team has won its first Gold and Bronze Loerie awards for its work on BBC Lifestyle’s Great South African Bake Off and BBC Brit’s Top Gear. It marks a year since the new global brands were launched to the South African market. Since then, the full channel portfolio on DStv featuring news, entertainment and lifestyle programming, has gone from strength to strength. BBC Worldwide opened its African office in Johannesburg in January 2015, and in August 2015 hired its first in-country senior marketing manager, Shireez Latief who has successfully introduced a South African voice to its marketing strategy. Mbeki & Rupert to address SA’s 2016 Sunday Times Top 100 Companies Awards Former South African president, Thabo Mbeki, has been confirmed to deliver the keynote address at the prestigious Sunday Times Top 100 Companies awards event next month, where Dr Johann Rupert – chairman of Swiss-based luxury-goods company Richemont and South Africa-based Remgro – will accept the Sunday Times Top 100 Companies Lifetime Achievement Award in recognition of his contribution to the country’s economy. Previous winners of the Sunday Times Top 100 Companies Lifetime Achievement Award include Dr Christo Wiese, Bobby Godsell, Brian Joffe, Nelson Mandela, Allan Gray, Stephen Koseff, Richard Maponya, Bill Venter, Nthato Motlana, Donald Gordon, Sam Motsuenyane, Koos Bekker, Raymond Ackerman and Anton Rupert. The Sunday Times Top 100 Companies tracks the best-performing businesses on the JSE, acknowledging those with the highest shareholder returns over the past five years. Labstore celebrates second anniversary of SA launch Labstore South Africa, local office of Y&R Advertising’s digitally-led retail and shopper marketing network, is celebrating the second anniversary of its launch in South Africa – and the Labstorians are taking stock of their challenges and triumphs against the backdrop of an ever-evolving local shopper marketing landscape. The shopper marketing business unit of Y&R South Africa has not only reeled in new business (with six major client wins spanning across 22 separate brands), but has built a formidable shopper marketing team over the last two years. In July 2016, it was also announced that Labstore SA would form the shopper marketing leg of the newly formed VML and Y&R Africa Group entity, together with Y&R South Africa and digital specialist, NATIVE VML. “Becoming the shopper specialist nestled within such a powerful and globally rooted Group is a significant milestone for us,” says Carolyn White, MD of Labstore South Africa and Africa. “It signals an industry shift in the sense that shopper marketing is no longer seen as just the in-store activation space, nor ideation in shopper channels only. Shopper-led strategic insights into consumer behaviour and the need for multi-channel solutions that connects brands and experiences, are becoming paramount,” she explains. TBWA\ Africa kicks ‘Disruption’ up a notch Only businesses with strong fundamentals, a consistent approach and gutsy resilience have been able to weather the particularly tough business environment in sub-Saharan Africa over the past 12 months, and they are going to have to maintain a robust constitution for the foreseeable future, says TBWA’s Director of Africa Operations, Graham Cruikshanks. He says breaking through the negative sentiment of a difficult 2015 and 2016 has been challenging for all businesses in Africa, but TBWA’s decision to re-boot its proprietary Disruption® tool across its Africa network in 2015 paid dividends. “The move saw offices transformed and processes modified. There is a palpable sense that Disruption® is more deeply embedded throughout our business than ever before.” Speaking ahead of TBWA\ Africa’s annual Africa Conference, Cruikshanks says the group intends to kick Disruption® up a notch when it hosts its 2016 conference in Windhoek at the end of the month. “This is in line with TBWA\’s global 21st century ambition to use Disruption® as the engine to drive growth by attracting 21st century brands. This year’s conference will see Cruikshanks and his team share global updates as well as TBWA’s own Disruption® Roadmap for the business and how it translates for Africa. Alliance Media partners with Botswana for 50th Botswana celebrates its 50th year of independence this month and Alliance Media, who has been operating in Botswana for 18 years of this period, is joining in the celebrations. The Alliance Media office in Gaborone has been a strong contributor to the country in creating employment, adding to the economy and providing innovative Out Of Home (OOH) media to the country’s many advertisers. Alliance Media holds the exclusive advertising rights at the Sir Seretse Khama International airport, where it is has donated a billboard to Botswana to commemorate this Jubilee occasion. “Alliance Media is proud to acknowledge the 50 year mark of Botswana’s independence and is pleased to donate this premium advertising site to the country for the month.” says Greg Benatar, sales and marketing director.     Related Articles: Media moves: SPARK Media launches programmatic division, new CTIO for MTN SA, win for Irvine Partners News briefs: News24’s #BeautifulNews, Bookmarks deadline extended, PAMRO 2017, Kaya’s summer campaign Media moves: Primedia launches digital audio advertising, Craig Nicholson joins The SpaceStation Kenya: Emerging from the storms Ghana: Rapidly expanding with changing mindsets Want to continue this conversation on The Media Online platforms?

W+K will be tasked with developing integrated marketing promoting all Duracell brands, including digital, social, TV, experiential and design initiatives. Its first work for Duracell is expected some time in early 2017. “At Duracell, we strive to make world-class advertising and we are looking forward to partnering with W+K NY,” Duracell vice president of marketing Ramon Velutini said in a statement. “They have a proven track record of fueling iconic brands and we are excited to see what we can to together.” “Duracell is a great American brand. They make a trusted product that’s part of people’s everyday lives, and they have a real appetite for breakthrough work that will resonate in culture,” added W+K New York executive creative director Karl Lieberman. “All of this adds up to an ideal partner for us. We’re looking forward to helping to build the brand and sell some batteries.” According to Kantar Media, the brand spent around $30 million on measured media in 2015 and $11 million during the first half of this year. The latter figure is up from spending over the same period in 2015, but spending appears to be down from 2014, when the brand reportedly spent $50 million. W+K takes over for MDC Partners’ Anomaly, which won the account following a 2014 review. Anomaly’s recent work for the brand includes a Rogue One-themed holiday spot launched earlier this month, which follows a similar “Battle For Christmas Morning” effort released last year ahead of the release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Anomaly announced earlier this month that it was not participating in the review, which followed Berkshire Hathaway’s acquisition of Duracell from P&G. Anomaly sent us the following statement from CEO Carl Johnson: “In the week where we have been fortunate to win Best in Show at the ANA Multicultural Excellence Awards for our work on Duracell and also having just released our second high-profile Duracell/Star Wars Holiday campaign, we are announcing our parting of the ways with the company. Back in Spring, several weeks after completing the acquisition of Duracell from P&G, and following the departures of the previous Global CEO, and the General Manager of Duracell, North America, new owners, Berkshire Hathaway, decided to review all aspects of the business including their marketing agencies. This is 100 percent their right. It is also 100 percent our right to choose not to participate in the process; which is what we decided to do in this instance. Whilst ending our role as AOR at the end of June, in the spirit of partnership and professionalism, we agreed to continue working through to the end of the year, solely focusing on the completion of the Star Wars Holiday campaign which we have now successfully launched. We love the Duracell brand and are very proud of our work we made together over the years. We wish the new owners well and will be moving onto the many new opportunities in front of us.” That doesn’t exactly explain why they sat it out, but last week Johnson told Campaign that Duracell’s new leadership no longer had “shared ambition and shared values” in common with Anomaly. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Most Popular Berkshire Hathaway's Duracell has named Wieden & Kennedy, New York, as agency of record, the company said in a statement. Credit: Duracell The move comes around seven months after the brand moved to Berkshire from Procter & Gamble Co. But it may have more to do with a change in marketing leadership on the brand. Former Duracell VP-marketing Jeff Jarrett left this summer to become chief marketing officer of housewares marketer Everyware Global. Ramon Velutini, who had been a brand manager on Duracell at P&G and marketing director once the brand went to Berkshire, succeeded him. Wieden arrives on the scene only two years after Anomaly took the account from its long-time incumbent Acme Idea Co. following a review. And it comes amid renewed creative focus on the category, following rival Energizer parting with longtime agency TBWA/Chiat Day last year and naming Camp & King as its lead shop earlier this year. Energizer launched a new campaign with a redesigned, slimmer bunny in September. In a statement, Anomaly Global CEO Carl Johnson said Anomaly chose not to participate in the review that Wieden won, and said the agency change came following a review of all aspects of the Duracell business by Berkshire Hathaway that followed the departures of the brand's prior global CEO and general manager of Duracell North America. Anomaly actually ended its AOR role at the end of June, he said. "This is 100% their right," Mr. Johnson said. "It is also 100% our right to choose not to participate in the process." He noted that the news comes within a week of Anomaly winning a Best of Show at the ANA Multicultural Excellence Awards and releasing its second high-profile Duracell/Star Wars holiday campaign. "We love the Duracell brand and are very proud of our work we made together over the years," Mr. Johnson said. "We wish the new owners well and will be moving onto the many new opportunities in front of us." Duracell spent $25 million on measured media last year, according to the Advertising Age Datacenter, down 19% from the year earlier.

"They have a proven track record of fueling iconic brands, and we are excited to see what we can do together." Wieden New York Exec Creative Director Karl Lieberman said, "Duracell is a great American brand. They make a trusted product that's part of people's everyday lives, and they have a real appetite for breakthrough work that will resonate in culture. All of this adds up to an ideal partner for us. We're looking forward to helping build the brand and sell some batteries." The battery business – at least the part that Duracell and Energizer compete in – has been in long-term decline as device trends moved toward things that take different types of batteries. That led P&G to divest the brand, and Energizer to split off its faster-growing Edgewell personal-care business in recent years. But the category has had a bit of a resurgence since those deals were first announced in late 2014, with sales up 0.6% to $2.8 billion for the 52 weeks ended Oct. 8, according to Nielsen data from Deutsche Bank. That doesn't include the faster-growing e-commerce channel. Energizer has been doing particularly well, with growth accelerating since its new advertising went live. Sales were up 13.6% and market share up 2.7 percentage points for the four weeks ended Oct. 8. ~ ~ ~ CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story said Mr. Velutini had been a marketing director at P&G. He became marketing director just after the brand went to Berkshire Hathaway in March. The story was also updated with a statement from Anomaly Global CEO Carl Johnson.

By Ray Fittipaldo/Pittsburgh Post-Gazette It started with some twerking in the season opener and ended with a player suspension in what figures to be the most important game of the regular season. In between, As The Steelers Turned played on. There was the curious timing of a complaint about hard practices following a convincing home victory that brought the record to 4-1. And there was the weekly Antonio Brown dress code/touchdown celebration drama. The first half of the season might as well have been sponsored by Procter and Gamble. Am I the only one who wants this show cancelled? The drama-filled season started when Brown drew a flag for twerking following a touchdown in the season-opening victory in Washington. For the next several weeks Brown was asked more about penalties and fines for touchdown celebrations than anything having to do with the wins the Steelers were stacking. Brown twerked again against the Chiefs, was fined again and asked the same questions again. Was he putting himself before the team? Would he stop celebrating touchdowns? Why not just change it up and hand the ball to the official after you score? Brown’s response to the final one? “No, I’m going to do what I want.” If that quote doesn’t sum up what Brown is all about I don’t know what does. When Brown wasn’t getting asked about twerking in the first half of the season he was inviting questions about violating the NFL’s dress code nearly every week. During the game with the Jets an official told Tomlin Brown wouldn’t be able to continue in the game if he didn’t take off his Muhammad Ali tribute shoes. Tomlin had to tell Brown to remove the shoes and change into new ones in the middle of the game. Even when the team’s captains try to do something they believe is leading they end up causing some drama. Ben Roethlisberger no doubt was speaking for others when he brought up the practice regimen. But the only thing that knocked practice-gate off the airwaves of local talk radio was a humiliating road loss to the Dolphins. Last week, defensive captain Cam Hewayrd said “It was just like we quit” following the 27-16 loss to the Patriots. It’s a rare step for a captain of a professional sports team to suggest his teammates quit, and his coaches had to awkwardly answer questions about it the next day.  But at least Roethlisberger and Heyward had their hearts in the right place. They were trying to lead.  As for Brown? Who knows what his motives are?  Tomlin should take a cue from the other championship coach in town. He should tell his players what Mike Sullivan told the Penguins upon his hiring: “Just play.” Onto this week’s picks. I finally had some good karma with my best week yet. We’re 16 games above .500 through seven weeks.

After almost two years of litigation, Seventh Generation reportedly agreed to pay a $4.5 million settlement over allegations that it deceptively marketed, labeled, and promoted its cleaning and personal care products as ‘natural.’ The case, which was settled before it went to trial at courts in California and New York, stemmed in part from the fact that Seventh Generation admitted in a document on its website that it used synthetic ingredients in several products. Those substances include glycerin, sodium citrate and sodium hydroxide. The plaintiffs who filed the lawsuit alleged that by describing its products as “natural,” the company deceived customers into paying a premium for goods such as dish soap, surface cleaners and laundry detergent. This summer, the Vermont-based company unsuccessfully argued for the cases to be dismissed. When those attempts failed, the company agreed to pay a settlement after a year of negotiations. Seventh Generation also said it would remove labels such as ‘all natural’ and ‘100 percent natural’ from its packaging. It will also clarify how it defines terms such as ‘hypoallergenic’ and ‘nontoxic.’ Plaintiffs suing the company claim the use of chemicals such as methylisothiazolinone and benzisothiazolinone, which are antimicrobial preservatives, further confused customers. Clearly wanting to sweep this controversy under the carpet, at press time Seventh Generation made no mention of the settlement by press release. Seventh Generation’s competitors have challenged the veracity of its products’ safety for years. In 2010, the consumer packaged goods (CPG) giant Procter & Gamble accused the company of making false claims that its products lacked any harmful ingredients and were completely natural. As a result, Seventh Generation removed a video, which also asserted that P&G’s brands posed risks to consumers, from its website. Ironically, Seventh’s Generation’s enduring success has proven to become one of many thorns in P&G’s side as investors become increasingly worried about the Cincinnati-based company’s financial performance. As Bloomberg reported this month, companies including Tom’s of Maine, Method Home and the Honest Co. – all of which were nailed for ‘natural’ claims – contributed to P&G’s recent woes as more consumers want more sustainable products. Many of these smaller companies’ products are now mainstream and readily available in retailers such as Target, Walmart and Costco. Meanwhile, Unilever has proven adept at identifying niche companies that can add value to its portfolio. Starting with Dollar Shave Club, the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate is on a spending spree that included an interest in the Honest Co. before its September announcement that it would acquire Seventh Generation. Hence the eventual decision for Seventh Generation to settle its litigation in order to maximize its going price, which was reportedly an estimated $700 million. Seventh Generation joins a long list of companies targeted for making ‘natural’ claims that many consumer groups find nebulous. Six years ago, Unilever’s Ben & Jerry’s agreed to remove ‘natural’ from its colorful and cartoonish ice cream cartons. PepsiCo, another example of a multinational buying more niche and healthy brands, removed ‘all natural’ from its Naked Juice bottles after mounting complaints. This roster also includes the likes of Trader Joe’s, which was called out for listing ingredients such as evaporated cane juice (fancy speak for sugar) on its private-label food products. The lesson for all companies here is that any and all claims about their ingredients’ safety and origin must be watertight – or else these brands risk becoming ensnared in a social media frenzy or, even worse, costly litigation. To do otherwise ignores market realities. After all, products such as those labeled ‘organic‘ began to thrive not because of proven science, but because of exaggerated worries over conventional products. On that point, claims about so-called “dangerous” ingredients, such as methylisothiazolinone, are made by organizations such as the Environmental Working Group (which currently urges visitors to its site to first consider making a donation) are not made to protect consumers. And their fundraising models are often dependent on appealing to consumers’ worst fears. In turn, those worries fuel donations that allow this cycle to continue. Meanwhile, many consumers are still confused and do not know which brands to trust. CPG companies must decide whether they want to make exhaustive claims that their products are safe, or just eliminate them entirely. So, if you are still puzzled over whether you should buy cleaning products from the likes of Seventh Generation or those branded by P&G or Colgate-Palmolive, there is a middle ground: Clean your house with a 5 percent white vinegar solution. Unless, of course, you are gluten intolerant.

I can send you photos of my 3 year old’s scarred body from her allergy to Methylisothiazolinone. She was patch tested and biopsied and suffered greatly for over a year. The main culprits were baby wipes and detergent that were made by seventh generation. It is dangerous. Many people suffer. And people can become sensitized to it so we all have the capability of getting this allergy because the high percentage of the ingredient that is in soaps, paints, glue and detergents.

The Paris appeal court confirmed a 2014 conviction of 13 sanitary product manufacturers, reducing the fine slighly but still leaving at a record level. The companies - Colgate-Palmolive, Henkel, Reckitt Benckiser, Sara Lee, SC Johnson and Bolton Solitaire, Laboratoires Vendôme, Gillette, Beiersdorf, Vania, Unilever, Procter & Gamble and L'Oréal - "coordinated their commercial policy towards supermarkets between 2003 and 2006,, in particular on price rises," the court ruled, confirming an earlier judgement. It reduced the fine slightly from 951.1 million euros to 948.9 million euros but the figure is still a record.

Featured links to other websites Huge price-fixing fine is upheld October 28, 2016 THE Court of Appeal has upheld a record-breaking fine for price-fixing imposed on 13 of the worlds largest consumer companies. The court ruled that the near-1bn fine handed out to multinationals Colgate-Palmolive, Henkel, Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Reckitt Benckiser, Sara Lee, SC Johnson and Bolton Solitaire, Laboratoires Vendôme, Gillette, L'Oreal, Beiersdorf and Vania, should stand, though it did reduce the amount slightly from 951.1million to 948.9million. In December 2014, industry regulator the Autorité de la Concurrence had imposed sanctions totalling 345.2m in relation to price-fixing on cleaning products and a further 605.9m for price-fixing on personal hygiene products. It is the largest total fine the Autorité de la Concurrence has ever imposed. The previous highest was a 534m penalty imposed on mobile phone operators in 2005. The prices of popular brands in France were fixed, the regulator said - including Vanish stain remover, Palmolive washing-up liquid, Sanex and Petit Marseillais shower gels, shampoos including Head & Shoulders, and Colgate toothpaste, along with well-known brands of mouthwash, deodorant, shaving cream and razors. The regulator said that between 2003 and 2006, executives from the companies met 'regularly and secretly to coordinate their commercial policies and discuss their pricing policies'.

Josey High School junior Ladavious Sorrells, a participant in Textron Specialized Vehicles’ Reaching Potential through Manufacturing (RPM) program, assembles a speed control unit at the RPM campus Thursday Officials with Textron Specialized Vehicles and the Richmond County Board of Education cut a ribbon commemorating the opening of the Reaching Potential through Manufacturing campus. As an abused child, Kimberly Pritchett's focus wasn't on high school. Neither was Dayton Tritt's — his parents were drug addicts. Travon Anderson didn't think he would go back to school after getting expelled for fighting. And Leonka Carter missed so many classes because of leukemia, she thought graduation was out of reach. But all four Richmond County high schoolers, and 71 other at-risk students, are not only back on the path to completing their high school diplomas, but are earning money and learning skills that could land them high-paying manufacturing jobs. That's thanks to Textron Specialized Vehicles' newly created Reaching Potential through Manufacturing initiative, a school-to-work program known as RPM. It lets students put in eight-hour shifts at a special campus on Mike Padgett Highway to catch up on their studies, develop a work ethic and – possibly – get a chance to become a full-time Textron employee. Textron Specialized Vehicles President Kevin Holleran said the partnership with the Richmond County Board of Education aims to reduce the county's dropout rate and create a pipeline of potential employees, which the company needs to staff its growing local operations. In February, the maker of E-Z-GO, Cushman and Tug brand products acquired Augusta's former Procter & Gamble plant to expand production of its Bad Boy off-road vehicle line. And earlier this month it announced it would relocate its Charlotte, N.C.-based Jacobsen business to Augusta. Five years ago Textron employed 600 in Augusta. It expects to have 1,200 employees by the end of next year, Holleran said. "To continue that growth we must have a viable, well-educated and prepared workforce to be the engine behind our manufacturing," he said. "To have that workforce we felt we must build it. ... Our schools need our help, that's why we created RPM." The program was launched in August at the start of the regular school year, but its public unveiling was postponed until Thursday. RPM is modeled on a similar initiative created a decade ago by Carrollton, Ga.-based Southwire Co. RPM students feed Textron's four production lines with more than 130 parts – everything from brake cables to solenoids. Three lines are in the main E-Z-GO golf car factory on Marvin Griffin Road and one is in the former P&G plant, which produces the Bad Boy "Stampede" 4X4 off-road vehicle. "These student's aren't just bolting together parts," Plant Manager Heather Meyer said. "They're involved in every facet of this plant's operation. We expect these students to be leaders in running this plant. If this plant doesn't run well, then our other facilities are not going to run efficiently." The campus operates from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., as the four-hour classroom/four-hour manufacturing schedule allows for overlap. Lunches and dinners are transported to the campus from Butler High School, and each shift is staffed by three teachers. RPM Principal Jason Moore, formerly of Cross Creek High School, said the RPM students' days are essentially two hours longer than their traditional high school counterparts. "They're definitely putting in the work," he said. Holleran said the company has invested "more than $1 million" to turn the nearly 50,000-square-foot site – a former surplus warehouse co-owned by Richmond County and the school board – into classroom and manufacturing space. Richmond County School Superintendent Angela Pringle thanked Textron and its partners for the investment and for recognizing that "students do not always follow the same path to success." "Initially I coined the program a game-changing program," she said. "I've now come to know that this project is actually life-changing. And it's not just life-changing for the students involved in the program, it's life-changing for the students' families and the extended families."

Hindustan Unilever (HUL), the country's largest consumer goods company, is eyeing new product categories in a quest for more growth. At an analysts' conference call on Wednesday, the company indicated it would introduce the Dollar Shave Club razor brand into India at an "opportune time". It has already extended the presence of its Dove brand into the baby skin care category, with bars, lotions and wet wipes. While a schedule for introduction of the Dollar Shave Club was not indicated, most analysts expect HUL to do so in the next six to eight months. It already has a presence in the overall Rs 5,000-crore male grooming market in India, with brands such as Fair & Lovely Men, Pond's for Men and Axe. A razor brand was a key missing link and will pit HUL directly against Procter & Gamble's Gillette, leader in the Rs 2,000-crore shaving category, a sub-segment of the overall male grooming market. As a category, male grooming has been growing at 20-25 annually and is expected to maintain this pace as more men aspire to look good. Dollar Shave was acquired by parent Unilever this July in a $1-billion acquisition, its second-largest American purchase after its $3.7-bn buying of beauty major Alberto Culver in 2011. Unilever had introduced one of Alberto Culver's popular brands, Tresemme, into India within two years of acquisition. It is now a key part of HUL's hair care portfolio, with annual sale of Rs 150-200 crore, say analysts. When announcing the September quarter results on Wednesday, Managing Director Sanjiv Mehta had said hair care growth was led by Dove and Tresemme, despite personal care as a whole being affected by the performance of soaps. And, that Dove's extension into the baby category was the right time to do so, as it had in the past decade established itself as a trustworthy brand, having entered the categories of body care, skin care, hair care and deodorants. Dove's extension into the baby category will imply a direct collision with Johnson & Johnson, the market leader.

Its share price popped 6 percent in the most recent settlement period. Short sellers bailed on the former king of the hill in early October. In the most recent short interest settlement period, Sprint Corp (NYSE: S) regained its title as the most shorted stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Even though the number of its shares short dwindled by more than 6 million between September 30 and October 14, the previous king of the hill, Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG) saw an even sharper drop in shares sold short -- more than 67 percent! Kansas-based telecommunications giant Sprint saw the number of its shares short shrink 3.8 percent to more than 161.07 million shares in the first half of the month. That was still a whopping 25.4 percent of the total float. At the most recently average daily volume, it would take about nine days to cover all short positions. During the period, Sprint was among companies that benefited from the recent launch of the latest iPhones. The share price ended the two-week short interest period about 6 percent higher, while the S&P 500 was down less than 2 percent. The stock now is up about 74 percent since the beginning of the year.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Oct 27, 2016 at 12:19PM Boasting over 400 brands in its portfolio, Unilever (NYSE:UL) carries thousands of different products across its varying businesses, all sold in varying sizes and types of packaging in countries all over the world. With an estimated two billion people using Unilever products each day, it becomes clear just how complex the company's operations can be. In this video from Industry Focus: Consumer Goods, the cast discusses how Unilever is working to control the impact of proliferating product variations on its business. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 12, 2016. Vincent Shen: I think it's important to point out that with every item that a company offers essentially, that has costs and investments associated with it. Think the storage of your completed product and the materials needed to create it, packaging, your supplier relationships, the marketing of your offerings, and also disposal in some cases for some products or SKUs that have gone obsolete. So every dollar a company spends toward one SKU that would have been better spent on another will potentially result in a reduction in the top or bottom line. Or both. So, I think for publicly traded companies, it's fair to say that investors and shareholders place a high value on also the predictability and accurate guidance from management. I think you had mentioned earlier a little bit about forecasts; if you have an overabundance of offerings and SKUs, I think it becomes increasingly difficult to essentially forecast out your expected sales and that can reduce profitability if discounting, for example, is needed to reduce stock or you have to send additional stocks to suppliers because items sold out unexpectedly. And let's jump directly into one of our two companies. Let's start with Unilever. No. 3 consumer-goods product company by revenue, behind Procter & Gamble and Nestle. Can you tell us a little bit about their efforts and how they've approached SKU rationalization? Asit Sharma: Sure. So, our supertrend for today is this idea of shrinking SKUs or SKU rationalization and why it's a supertrend and why Unilever is such a great example. We, in our last episode, separated the idea of just a trend from the idea of supertrend by saying if many corporations are out there jumping on this trend and they're both big and small, that is a great indication we're seeing a supertrend. Unilever fits right in because they're one of the biggest, baddest consumer goods companies on the planet. They have hundreds of brands and literally thousands and thousands of SKUs, and they practice what Vince has mentioned a couple times: SKU rationalization. Let's quickly define that term if you're not familiar with it. It's a really simple concept. SKU rationalization is when you use data and analytics to pare down those underperforming SKUs and then you transfer your resources into the SKUs which are getting market share. So we're going to use this term a lot, and it's a great way to sound really smart if you're talking to other investors; you can talk about SKU rationalization and your favorite companies. Unilever's multiyear goal is to reduce their SKU by 20%. When you visualize a company which is in hundreds of countries around the globe dealing with local markets, you can imagine the complexity of their operation. So for a company like this to decide to reduce SKUs ... well, let me stop here. Last week we talked about Nike, which I also call "nyke," SKUs are often pronounced as "skews," so if you hear me start saying "skews," same thing. But this multiyear goal sprung from management's realization that if we undertake this investment, we may reduce revenue somewhat but we're going to have more profitable products. I'd like to talk about one case study. This is something that happened several years ago, when Unilever's U.K. and Irish units combined into one group. When they got together, this was around 2008 to 2009, and they performed an analysis of their SKUs and they found that 60% of product variance contributed just 5% of their sales, but that made up 20% of inventory. And Vince, I know you had also seen that case study. What are your thoughts about that? That really opened my eyes to why a company should jump in and perform SKU rationalization. Shen: Yeah, those numbers -- notably the 5% of sales and the 20% of inventory -- is unbelievable. This case that you mentioned, I think it was from 2008 to 2009, but even as recently as 2014 Unilever still had about 50,000 SKUs in its portfolio. So it's a monumental task. You know, keeping track of that, managing that, and the fact that, as we'll get into more detail, about how the company and specifically the U.K. and Irish units kind of approached this issue. Really, the results you'll see have had a very direct impact on their financial performance. Asit Sharma has no position in any stocks mentioned. Vincent Shen has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink club catalyst From start-up to ‘scaled up’ NIMISH DWIVEDI BUSINESS DIRECTOR CARDS AND PAYMENTS VP BANK-FE CREDIT   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet Gangster/shutterstock.com ‘Got funding’, ‘valuation’ et al are passe. How about saying start-ups are those that sustained the show? There is no denying that India’s e-commerce start-up “ecosystem” has come a long way. From a time when the only source of funding available to start-ups was the capital that passionate founders had to put together from friends and family, the situation has changed so dramatically that today funds chase ideas. Indian start-ups have acquired valuations which make them bigger than manufacturing companies that have been listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange for decades. But a serious moment of self-reflection happened for this sector during the first half of 2016, besides dismaying tales of employees getting downsized or ventures going belly up. And while there has been a fair amount of focus on the financial indicators by which start-ups need to be assessed post that moment, there has not been much talk about their current brand attributes versus desired brand attributes to make this a vibrant and vital sector of the economy.Forget ‘Funding’ The first brand attribute that needs to be recast is ‘Funding.’ In a gold-rush like mentality, many investors will put in money in half-baked ideas, hoping for an exit. Take the tiny example amongst many funded start-ups, of TinyOwl, the food ordering app which got $16 million of Series B funding after an initial $4 million in Series A. Even an esteemed publication like Techcrunch announced this funding with the following additional information conveying TinyOwl’s potential — “India’s food ordering space is just one market booming in response to the growth of smartphones and mobile internet access in the county. An IDC report found India the fastest growing smartphone market in Asia — over 23 million smartphones were shipped in Q3 2014, according to the firm, which represented an 82 per cent growth on one year previously.” We all know how the TinyOwl story ended. This attribute of “Got Funding” where the amount of funding obtained defines the buzz around a start-up needs to be totally recast into the attribute of “Sustained and Scaled start-ups.” The biggest brand attribute that needs to be built for the start-up ecosystem is to make an example of start-ups that have sustained and scaled over three or may be five years. After all, the failure rate of start-ups is 90 per cent and if we add the factor of inability to scale, then that rate may go beyond 95 per cent. India needs to know stories of start-ups that have not just sustained but also scaled significantly beyond three to five years by building a solid business. And it is these sustaining start-ups that need to be encouraged to go to campuses as they can not only provide a learning ground for freshers but also allow these freshers to channelise their change-the-world ideas.Let’s drop ‘valuation’ The second brand attribute that needs to be recast is “Valuation”. This “valuation” attribute needs to change into the attribute of “Unique or Well Adapted Proposition.” For decades, the cornerstone of success in India for global giants like Colgate Palmolive, Unilever, Procter and Gamble and Cadbury’s has been their ability to adapt their core propositions and make them relevant both in terms of product formulation and packaging. Think Sunsilk Sachets to Colgate Tooth Powder and the unique messaging adaptation of their core brand values. Who can forget the “Kuch Khaas Hain” campaign from Cadbury’s attempting to take chocolate consumption away from being just children-centric to young adults and doing it with a very Indian tone. Now think of the adapted propositions in the e-commerce space. Most of them are just blind clones from other markets. If we look at the 9 unicorns in India which have a valuation of $1 billion, then one realises that only Paytm, Inmobi, Zomato, Mu Sigma and Ola stand out in terms of “unique or well-adapted propositions.” Inmobi and Mu Sigma are absolutely unique in the mobile advertising and analytics space while Paytm has adapted the concept of digital wallets for Indian markets. Ola has done the same for cab hailing and Zomato for restaurant listing and reviews. Others are mere clones of Amazon, ebay, Craigslist or many such global companies. That creates vulnerability for these unicorns, given India's distinct market dynamics and consumer preferences but also provides a window for them to adapt and innovate.Beware discounts The other attribute that has got associated with today's start ups is “Deep Discounting.” The only aspect that draws customers to these e-commerce sites is discounts. And when the funding dries up, the discounts disappear, the valuation plunges and the vicious cycle of lay-offs and closures begins. The attribute that this needs to be converted into is “Customer Experience.” Even if the start-up has a brilliant, game changing idea, if the execution and linked customer experience do not match up, then the start-up will not sustain. For all B2C e-commerce brands, the reference shifts to Amazon. But Amazon has been investing for years in never-before customer engagement algorithms to provide an unprecedented shopping experience at one end and in creating an incredible logistical infrastructure to deliver ahead of customer expectations at the other end. Speaking to Amazon’s physical growth, Jeff Bezos said in a rare interview that much of Amazon’s profit goes directly back into development projects aimed to take Amazon even closer to its customers. Fulfilment centres geared around ultra-quick online-to-doorstep delivery and pick-up services are one such investment Bezos considers an important link between online and offline convenience. Today, apps in India and sites claim food delivery in 30 minutes in India’s crowded cities but except for putting pressure on a poor delivery boy on a bike, there is no clarity on what they are doing differently to support this claim. Stories of such start-ups need to move away from this unsubstantiated claim and focus on whether they have done anything at all differently to deliver on such promises. Also, there is very little media focus on assessing the customer experience and satisfaction of e-commerce start-ups that have got lots of funding or have unprecedented valuations. From site experience to delivery to call centre to complaint handling, there are serious customer expectations that these start-ups need to deliver upon. Horror stories abound of unmet promises, wrong delivery of items, non-delivery and no shows and what not. There needs to be a benchmark measure of customer experience across all e-commerce start-ups that media covering the start-up sector needs to focus on. At present, media coverage is centred around making celebrities of start-up founders simply because they have secured $5 million of funding or achieved a valuation in someone's estimate of 500 million. Nothing on the user experience and the service standards of these entities. Start-ups that achieve these will not only continue to attract talent from India's top tier institutions but will never have to defer or rescind offers. And they will never be short of funding or valuations because the game changing ideas and technologies from these freshers will always help them stay a step ahead of competition.

Here are three foreign stocks investors should consider buying right now. Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Oct 27, 2016 at 10:32AM Image source: Getty Images. Though investing in foreign stocks brings with it some additional risks, finding the top international stocks to buy is also a great way to find and profit from opportunities many investors overlook. Case in point, Nestle (NASDAQOTH:NSRGY), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), and MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) are some of the best foreign businesses operating today, making these names some of the top international stocks to buy today. DEO data by YCharts. Nestle: the international dividend aristocrat Nestle is a classic "boring is beautiful" kind of company, and its ability to consistently execute its straightforward business model makes it a fantastic stock for international investors who aren't seeking something highly exotic. Today, Nestle stands as the world's largest food company; it owns over 2,000 brands and 20 brands that generate over $1 billion in annual sales. Much like U.S.-based consumer staples giants Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark, Nestle manufactures and sells a wide range of goods that consumers consistently buy regardless of the state of the economy. Given its massive size, the company's global distribution system also serves as a powerful competitive advantage, enabling it to easily adapt to trends more quickly than smaller competitors. Though the company dates back to 1875, Nestle's enviable streak of consecutive annual dividend increases started nearly a century later. Since 1959, the company has grown its annual cash payouts, easily qualifying the stock as a Dividend Aristocrat. Its 3.1% dividend yield combines with this track record to make Nestle one of the more alluring dividend growth stocks among international companies on the market today. Baidu: a generational Chinese growth stock Baidu remains one of my favorite international stocks -- I personally own it -- as well as a longtime recommendation in the Fool's premium services. Plainly stated, Baidu lies at the epicenter of several of the most important technology growth markets in the world's most populous country. Known as the "Google of China," Baidu operates what is by far the most dominant search engine in China. As one measure of market share, Baidu is estimated to have generated over 80% of all search engine advertising revenue in 2015; recall that Google is officially blocked in China. Despite historic spending to drive deeper into new growth markets, the outsized profitability of Baidu's search operations still managed to produce 15% operating margins in its most recent quarters.  Still catering to a relatively small percentage of its potential advertising audience, the growth potential of Baidu's core search operations are enough to justify owning this international stock. However, Baidu's aggressive push deeper into new online services like food deliveries and more, its Google-esque development of self-driving car technology, and its deep investments into nascent technology verticals like artificial intelligence each offer massive potential payoffs for investors. The state of the Chinese economy and intense competition from other large Chinese tech companies can indeed weigh on its volatile shares, but over the long term, Baidu offers international investors one of the most appealing growth profiles anywhere in the market. MercadoLibre: Latin America's e-commerce growth stock Much like Baidu, MercadoLibre has successfully applied a proven online business model -- e-commerce in this case -- and built a dominant regional franchise around it. Since it's easy to understand, think of MercadoLibre as the "Amazon or eBay of Latin America." The company operates the continent's largest e-commerce platform, spanning 13 countries and 550 million people. What's more, its impressive recent financial performance demonstrates what makes this international growth stock such an attractive option for investors today. In its most recent quarter, MercadoLibre saw its revenue increase 29% in U.S. dollar terms, and the volume of total units sold rose 45%. Perhaps more importantly, MercadoLibre continues to establish its ancillary payments and shipping services that leading e-commerce businesses like Amazon have leveraged as competitive advantages so successfully in recent years. MercadoLibre's PayPal-esque service MercadoPago saw the number of transactions it processed rise 76% in the company's most recent quarter; its current penetration among MercadoLibre users today stands at 75%. Similarly, the shipment volume in the company's fulfillment services operation also doubled from the year prior.   In virtually every sense, MercadoLibre appears to be firing on all cylinders. Despite that success, MercadoLibre's full-year 2015 sales of $651 million accounted for just 1.5% of Latin America's estimated $40.9 billion in e-commerce sales, a number expected to double by 2019. MercadoLibre will certainly face volatility in its business, particularly given the region's long-standing history of foreign currency turmoil. Competitors like Amazon also figure to move deeper into the continent. However, with its brand credibility and customer-centric suite of offerings, MercadoLibre, like Nestle and Baidu, still stands as one of the best international stocks for long-term investors.

What students look for in employers According to the survey results, 60 % of respondents indicated career growth as one of the main factors of employer attractiveness in 2015. Besides career perspectives, students are interested in salary level, international experience, opportunities for personal and professional development and work schedule. It is worth mentioning that only 14% of students noted official employment relations (supplemented with contract) as an important employer choice criterion Where students want to work This year the survey participants independently named more than 170 companies as preferred employers to work for. Based on the survey results, the most attractive employers in 2015 were (in alphabetical order): Azercell, Azersun Holding, BP, Gilan Holding, Ministry of Labor and Social Protection, Procter & Gamble, Pasha Holding, Schlumberger, SOCAR and one of the Big 4 audit companies. It is not surprising that these are mostly large and well-known international and Azerbaijani companies, as employer attractiveness among young candidates significantly depends on their awareness about its corporate and product brands Where students get information about employers The vast majority of respondents receive information about employers from Internet sources (70%) including news from the Internet (51%), social networks (49%), ads on the internet (25%) and job portals (23%). It may be noticed, that news from the Internet and social networks are more efficient communication channels for reaching out to students than corporate websites or job portals. Difficulties that students deal with during a job search The results of the survey show that the majority of students (39%) did not have any difficulties while searching for a job or during the recruitment process. At the same time, the students who had certain difficulties most often named miscommunication with the companies as the main challenge in recruitment process (in particular, unclear candidate selection process, limited information about the company and job opportunities, unclear communications). This may be an important message to recruitment functions of the companies targeting talent in the local labor market, as the success of employer branding and recruitment strategy strongly relies on the effectiveness of communications. What students think of relocation More than 70% of students are ready to relocate abroad for employment purposes. Given a chance, 54% of them would relocate within a year and 13% - within 3 years respectively. On the other hand, a third of all students do not consider relocating abroad in the short and mid-term perspective. These results once again show that majority of the students consider the opportunities for gaining international experience as an appealing factor while choosing an employer. About the survey The Best Employer Survey is conducted by EY in Azerbaijan since 2016. The main goal of the survey is to analyze the preferences of students in choosing an employer. According to EY’s methodology, respondents are asked to independently name up to three employers in order of their attractiveness. Participants of the survey also indicate factors of employer’s attractiveness and sources of information about them, as well as answer some other questions, which help to determine the major trends on the labor market. The People Advisory Services practice at EY Azerbaijan conducts surveys to assess employer image among employees, contractors and business partners and provides consulting services on the development of employer value proposition as well as other HR related matters.

In which companies do professionals choose to work and why? The Best Employer Survey 2015 conducted by EY shows that career growth is a key factor in an employer’s attractiveness for professional candidates. Over 1,400 respondents with experience in various industries took part in the survey. According to the survey, key employer choice criteria for professional candidates include opportunities for career growth (77%), as well as personal and professional development (68%). Besides these, professional candidates most frequently pay attention to corporate culture, prospects of gaining international experience, and the salary level. The key differences between the preferences of professional candidates and students included their approach to fringe benefits, which seem to be more important for professional candidates (mentioned by 34% of respondents) than they are for students (14%). Where candidates want to work Candidates named over 200 companies that they considered to be the best employers in Azerbaijan. The majority of the companies mentioned were from the FMCG, professional services and telecommunications industries. According to the professional candidates, the most attractive employers are (in alphabetical order): Azercell, BP, McKinsey & Company, PASHA Bank, PASHA Holding, PMD Group, SAIPEM, SOCAR, and some of the Big 4 companies. Where candidates get information about employers The most popular source of information about employers according to professionals is Internet resources (71%). Among these, the majority of candidates named job portals and social networks as the ones most frequently used (both sources were mentioned by 46% of respondents). Besides Internet resources, professional candidates often mentioned personal and business contacts as important sources of information. Almost 40% of respondents indicated that they got information about employers from their friends and relatives, while 20% mentioned business contacts. In addition, every third respondent received information from traditional mass media sources. Difficulties that candidates face during their job search According to the survey, the majority of candidates (46%) have not faced any difficulties in the process of job search. However, similarly to students, the professional candidates named lack of information about selection processes and employment opportunities among the key challenges, as well as miscommunication with companies. The fact that these problems were stated by both audiences (students and professional candidates) may prove that companies need to pay more attention to how they communicate their employer value proposition. What professional candidates think of relocation Almost 80% of professional candidates stated that they would like to work overseas. Contrary to students, only 16% of professional candidates are ready to relocate within the next year, whereas the majority (46%) would consider such an opportunity within the upcoming three years. The remaining 38% of respondents would not consider relocating abroad in the short to mid-term.

Introduces Business Advisory Board and Celebrates Recent Listing by Opening Toronto Stock Exchange November 2 WINNIPEG, MB--(Marketwired - October 27, 2016) - 3D Signatures Inc. (TSX VENTURE: DXD) (the "Company" or "3DS") is pleased to introduce the following internationally renowned senior biotech executives as members of the Company's Business Advisory Board. Jonathan Goodman, Director & CEO, Knight Therapeutics Inc. Mr. Goodman is the founder and CEO of Knight Therapeutics Inc. (TSX: GUD) ("Knight" or "Knight Therapeutics"), a specialty pharmaceutical company headquartered in Quebec, Canada. Knight was established by Mr. Goodman in 2014, and has a current market cap of approximately $1.2 billion. Prior to Knight, Mr. Goodman was a co-founder, President and CEO of Paladin Labs Inc. ("Paladin Labs") which was acquired by Endo International plc (TSX: ENL) in February 2014 for $3.2 billion. Mr. Goodman was formerly a consultant with Bain & Company and also worked in brand management for Procter & Gamble. Mr. Goodman holds a B.A. from McGill University (Great Distinction) and the London School of Economics (1st Class Honours). Additionally, he holds an LL.B. and an M.B.A. from McGill University. Bringing proven international success with Paladin Labs and Knight Therapeutics, 3DS will greatly benefit from Mr. Goodman's entrepreneurial experience and global networks, both in the pharmaceutical industry and in healthcare capital markets. Knight Therapeutics is a strategic investor in 3DS. Dr. Heiner Dreismann, Past President and CEO, Roche Molecular Systems Dr. Dreismann is a seasoned executive with more than 24 years of experience in the healthcare industry, and is regarded as a pioneer in the early adoption of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, one of the most ubiquitous technologies in molecular biology and genetics research today. He had a successful career at the Roche Group from 1985 to 2006 where he held several senior positions, including President and CEO, Roche Molecular Systems, Head of Global Business Development, Roche Diagnostics, and Member of Roche's Global Diagnostic Executive Committee. At the time of his departure, Dr. Dreismann had grown Roche Molecular Systems to approximately $1.2 billion USD in annual revenue. He currently serves on the boards of several public and private health care companies. Dr. Dreismann earned a MSc degree in biology and his Ph.D in microbiology/molecular biology (summa cum laude) from Westfaelische Wilhelms University (The University of Munster) in Germany. Dr. Dreismann brings proven strategic vision and world-class diagnostics expertise to 3DS. The Company expects to benefit greatly from his substantial commercial networks and unparalleled global perspective on the medical diagnostics market. John Lindsay, Founder, SciPartners Mr. Lindsay began his career at Millipore Corporation, Merck KGaA, and quickly advanced to become the youngest Vice President in the history of the company. He was promoted to Executive Vice President of several divisions, including the Analytical Group and Milligen Biosearch Divisions. In 2000, he founded SciPartners, with the objective of building a platform for development of early stage European and North American firms. His focus is the life sciences market, and over the past 14 years he has successfully built up sales and marketing that led to rapid growth and increased revenues for many companies, and the acquisition of ProXeon by ThermoFisher as well as the acquisition of Halo Genomics by Agilent. Mr. Lindsay's history of repeated commercial success, working with major healthcare companies, as well as small and emerging life sciences companies, will greatly aid 3DS as it endeavors to become a leading diagnostic and prognostic company for cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Comments from 3DS Chairman "In a very short time, we have built an exceptional Business Advisory Board," said John Swift, Chairman, 3DS. "This speaks to the strength of our technology and to the magnitude of our business opportunity. As the Company advances its first-in-class minimally invasive tests for major diseases such as prostate cancer and Alzheimer's disease, independent guidance from the Business Advisory Board will be of tremendous assistance in making the right decisions at the right time." 3DS Opens Toronto Stock Exchange To celebrate the recent September 13, 2016 listing on TSX Venture Exchange (TSXV), members of 3DS' senior management and directors will open trading at Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) on Wednesday, November 2 at 9:30 a.m. EDT.

Of course, colors, patterns and silhouettes evolve over time. But overall, these industries continue to send messages to women (and arguably, men) that they must conform to a certain ideal. During the 1990s and early 2000s, the fashion and beauty industries arguably became even more reactionary. Runway shows featured thinner and thinner models, and digital technologies presented models with a look and body that, frankly, is impossible for any “normal” person to obtain. The use of models who looked emaciated in part led to the rise of the “fat acceptance” movement as more women became exhausted by large corporations dictating how they should look and feel. But the evidence suggests the norms of what is beautiful — and, quite frankly, who is allowed to feel beautiful and fabulous — are changing. And companies are beginning to take notice. One such watershed moment is CoverGirl’s recent decision to hire its first male brand ambassador. Earlier this month the 55-year-old cosmetics brand, now a subsidiary of Procter & Gamble, hired 17-year-old James Charles, a high school senior who lives in upstate New York’s Hudson Valley. The popular YouTuber and Instagram celebrity has parlayed his glam social media presence into a gig that allows him to work with the likes of Katy Perry. It’s a rapid ascent for Charles. Just last month, he became a mini-sensation on Twitter by showing how he brought a ring light to his senior picture shoot to help his cheekbones stand out. And now, only a few weeks later, he is associated with a brand that has showcased a long list of Hollywood and fashion icons, including Christie Brinkley, Rihanna, Drew Barrymore and Sofia Vergara. In a recent interview with the New York Times, Charles succinctly explained how his signing on with CoverGirl symbolizes what is going on in the world of fashion and beauty, especially for men. No, his penchant and passion for hair and make up is not some “gender-bender” experimentation. Men like Charles are not dabbling with what it is like to be a woman: They are simply dictating what it means to express themselves on their own terms. And no, despite the enduring popularity of “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” Charles’ interest has nothing to do with drag performing. In his words, he’s just a “boy in make-up,” unlike a drag performer, who is a man parodying and performing as a if he were a woman. The fact is that more men are stepping out of what has traditionally been their comfort zone and refuse to apologize for the fashion choices they make. One of the greatest examples is NBA star Russell Westbrook, whose fashion choices are undeniably hot while he rewrites what it means to dress like a “jock.” Fashion designers such as Rick Owens and Nicopanda are challenging what is menswear — catcalls of “androgyny,” “effeminate” or “flamboyant” be damned. Much of Gucci’s latest menswear line made waves at fashion shows on both sides of the Atlantic for its patterns, cuts and fabric choices. And more celebrities, including Jaden Smith and Kanye West, have not been shy about wearing mini-skirts. Even David Beckham has been spotted in a sarong. In the end, more of us have become part of a less rigid society. We’re more individualistic and are not shy about pushing conventional boundaries. Fashion and beauty companies have no choice but to accept, and even celebrate, these trends – or else they risk becoming irrelevant.

Minyanville Why the Turn in Consumer Staples Could be Real By Scutify Oct 26, 2016 10:47 pm PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. Consumer Staples stocks, those of companies whose products you use every day like Procter & Gamble and Clorox had a solid run higher from the 2009 low. They continued to rise almost uninterrupted until the beginning of 2015. That is when they changed character to a sideways consolidation. They dipped in August when the market swooned and then quickly recovered to the consolidation zone where they churned until February. After February though they started higher again. They reached a peak in July and then started a pullback. No mere consolidation this time. the pullback has lasted almost 4 months at this point. But the last couple of days may be showing signs that the worst is over and Consumer Staples are ready to move higher. The first thing to note is that the ETF that tracks Consumer Staples ($XLP) had found support at the 200 day SMA to start September. It gave up that support at the beginning of October and it became resistance, with additional horizontal resistance at 52.50. The pullback now found support at a 50% retracement of the last move higher. The ETF jumped up from that that Tuesday and is sitting just beneath the 200 day SMA. As it does the RSI has tuned up and is moving over the mid line. The MACD has also crossed up and is rising. There are 3 things to watch to confirm if the Consumer Staples are ready for another run to the upside. First is continuation of the RSI over 60 into the bullish zone. The second is the MACD moving up into positive territory. The third and most important is the price moving up over 54. Until then it is a good start.

Knowing whether your fund manager has his or her own skin in the game tells you a lot about the incentives they have. INVESTOR CLINIC What if my broker goes bust? … and other reader questions Add to ... John Heinzl The Globe and Mail Published Friday, Oct. 28, 2016 5:30PM EDT Last updated Friday, Oct. 28, 2016 5:35PM EDT Comments Print / License AA What sort of protection for your funds do you get from a non-bank online broker (such as Qtrade or Questrade) compared to a bank-owned online broker (such as BMO InvestorLine or RBC Direct Investing) if the broker should go belly up? All investment dealers (including the ones you mentioned) that are members of the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada are also automatically members of the Canadian Investor Protection Fund. CIPF covers property – including cash and securities – that is lost because of an investment firm’s insolvency. However, CIPF does not cover losses that arise because of bad investment advice, fraud or a drop in an investment’s value. Coverage is generally up to $1-million for all non-registered and tax-free savings accounts combined; $1-million for all registered retirement accounts; and $1-million for registered education savings plans. More information – and a list of CIPF members – is available at cipf.ca. How does an exchange-traded fund or stock open at a higher (or lower) price than it closed at the night before? This has always puzzled me. Market prices are determined by the “bid” (what a potential buyer is willing to pay) and “ask” (what a potential seller is willing to accept). As bids and asks change throughout the day, so too does the price at which a stock trades. It’s largely the same for ETFs, whose prices are determined by the value of their underlying securities. Lots of things can happen between the time the stock market closes and when it opens the next day – such as economic, earnings or political news – that cause bid and ask prices to change. As a result, the opening price of a stock or ETF is rarely the same as the previous day’s closing price. I see in your Strategy Lab model dividend portfolio that you own Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Procter & Gamble (PG). They are very good individual stocks but would you consider, say, the Vanguard Large-Cap ETF that includes them? My reason for asking is that I am a pretty bad stock picker. If you don’t have the time or expertise to choose individual stocks then by all means consider an ETF. Just make sure you pick an ETF with low management expense ratio and a straightforward investing approach so you’ll know exactly what you are buying. The Vanguard Large Cap ETF (VV) fits the bill: It has an expense ratio of 0.08 per cent and holds more than 600 of the largest U.S. companies. Alternatively, you may wish to consider an S&P 500 index ETF or a large-cap U.S. dividend ETF. These ETFs will all have a fair amount of overlap in their holdings. Some Canadian investors prefer to buy currency-hedged U.S. ETFs but there are pros and cons to hedging, as I’ve discussed previously (tgam.ca/EQOO). You have mentioned that you generally try to keep your U.S.-listed stocks to less than 10 per cent of your portfolio. Why 10 per cent? That’s just my way of controlling my currency risk – the number is not carved in stone. Other people may have a higher – or lower – tolerance for currency volatility. Certainly, with the Canadian dollar plunging from more than $1 (U.S.) in early 2013 to its current level of about 75 cents, the more U.S. dollar exposure you had, the better your returns were. Now, however, I’m not as eager to stick my neck out currency-wise for the simple reason that a recovery in the Canadian dollar would pose a headwind. It’s worth pointing out, however, that many Canadian-listed companies – such as utilities, banks and insurers – have extensive U.S. or foreign holdings, so even a portfolio of strictly Canadian-listed stocks will have some U.S. dollar exposure. My daughter is now in a position to start investing in stocks but has no knowledge or understanding of markets. Could you suggest a good book or two that she could read that would be of assistance and give her some basic information to get started? I’m going to draw on the collective wisdom of Globe and Mail readers for this one. If you’ve come across a great introductory investing book (or website, YouTube channel or other resource), tell me about it in an e-mail and I’ll publish some of your tips in a future column.

(Photo: Provided/ Steven Chau for Techstars) The relationship between local startups and corporations is putting Cincinnati on the map as a destination city for entrepreneurial enterprise. The city hosted Techstar's largest annual conference "FounderCon" earlier this month, which brought more than 1,000 investors, entrepreneurs and corporate executives together to network. Techstars is a global ecosystem that helps entrepreneurs build their business and bring new technologies to market through a network of accelerators that extends across 15 cities and five countries. It focuses on building "up and coming" places, like Cincinnati. Techstars partner Ari Newman said the growing entrepreneurial mindset of large corporations and their support and engagement with startups in Cincinnati makes it unique. That relationship is raising the profile of this city's startup scene in terms of technology and innovation. CINCINNATI.COM Cincy startup scene sees biggest growth in the nation for 2016 Cincinnati is making the case that corporations should engage with and invest in startups. Why? Because startups are nimble and they can solve problems faster and cheaper than the corporate machine. Dave Drach, vice president of partnership at Techstars, said startups are the only place for corporations to tap into the disruptive chance that is necessary for them to be viable in the future. Cincinnati has the structure for big corporations and small enterprises to work together rather than against each other. "When that communication gap between the two is bridged, you start to see the innovation flow inside the corporations and success flow back to entrepreneurs in terms of their company's growth and that supports the entire ecosystem." He said tapping into startups can be a replacement for the research and development that was classically done inside a corporation and the innovation should be done externally. Startups are the key to corporate innovation Mark Finn, global transformation advisor at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said large corporations need to embrace the digitization of their businesses and business models. Consumers are demanding a digital experience, which is creating a lot of opportunities for new services and products to be brought to market. Techstars companies and corporations network at Techstar's annual conference FounderCon 2016 in Cincinnati.  (Photo: Provided/Steven Chau for Techstars) "It's critical to be engaged in the startup ecosystem for visibility into what's going on," Finn said. "And to learn how companies are bringing things to market with new models." Otherwise, he said, the corporations will wake up one day and realize they are irrelevant. That's where startups come in. "You have the scale and distribution, but you can't innovate as quickly as you can outside," Finn said. "That's what's driving this movement." Valerie Sheppard, comptroller and treasurer of Procter & Gamble, said working with startups and venture capitalists can provide solutions to business problems "that we might not otherwise see inside our four walls." The financial benefit comes from getting new innovation into their business and flowing that through to the consumers they serve. She said the company is also an investor in Cintrifuse and expects that to return a profit. Working with an early stage company does present some risks because they may not be around in a year or two. Finn said the big questions are "Is this a partner I can invest the resources in to work with longer term; and if it falls over, will it damage the brand?" A corporation such as PricewaterhouseCoopers that has more than 220,000 employees and does about $36 billion in revenue has a lot to lose. He said working with companies that have been filtered through Techstars is a way to mitigate that. "You have to balance that out with the risk of not innovating and not moving forward," Finn said. That corporate engagement can also spur growth for a startup. "The biggest thing an early stage company needs is customers and revenue and proof their solution is valuable in the market, which a corporation can offer them," Newman said. The startup can use early product market data to sell other customers, raise money and create more opportunities. Techstars companies and corporations network at Techstar's annual conference FounderCon 2016 in Cincinnati.  (Photo: Provided/ Steven Chau for Techstars) The success from those partnerships are a biproduct of events like FounderCon, Newman said. And they strengthen the economic development of the region. Techstar companies, investors and corporate representatives were matched and had more than 380 meetings with each other over two days at the conference. That is valuable because investors get to see high-quality, pre-vetted early stage companies in one place and the companies make their pitch to up to 10 people in one day, which usually takes months. Newman said in order for a startup community to thrive and grow, it takes participation from everyone that is vested in that community’s success. That includes angel investors, institutional funds, entrepreneurs, mentors and the city. "Everyone has to come together to elevate the activity and tell the story of why it’s a great community," Newman said. "Maybe FounderCon is a tipping point... that will put investors and companies in front of each other because we want to see them get funded." 93 CONNECTTWEET 49 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2eEcWuA TOP VIDEOS Bengals vs. Bills Week 11 predictions 6:02 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 15. 20:46 Supermoon rises over Cincinnati 0:55 Bengals vs. Giants wrap-up 3:15 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29 Jeff Ruby: 'I sense there is not going to be justice' for the DuBose family 2:18 Deters on Tensing crying on the stand: ‘The place to be upset... was after you just blew someone's brains out' 26:55 Defense makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 41:26 Prosecution makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 26:35 Tensing: 'Oh my God, he's going to run me over, he's going to kill me' 12:03 Use-of-force expert: 'The actions of Ray Tensing were justified' 0:50 Which stores are opening, closing Thanksgiving Day 0:34 \u0022I can't wait to see Tensing on the stand\u0022 0:55 Cincinnati Police Criminalist: Tensing 'seemed nervous or afraid' 2:59 Crime lab: No evidence on Tensing’s boots that he was dragged 4:07 Alternate juror in Ray Tensing trial has been dismissed 1:24 Born in Cincinnati, celebrated around the world: An anthem that unites us 3:39 Inside Prep Sports 360: Colerain Football prepares for playoffs 5:05 JP Macura looks ahead to the season 2:24 Entrepreneurs & Startups State awards millions to Cincy startup groups Kate Murphy Cincinnati saw strong startup growth in 2015, index shows Fatima Hussein NBC News profiles Cincinnati's Mortar program Bowdeya Tweh CompleteSet joins Techstars startup accelerator Bowdeya Tweh NKY startups to attend global entrepreneurship summit Fatima Hussein Small biz gets big showcase at XU Bowdeya Tweh This story is part of Entrepreneurs & Startups State awards millions to Cincy startup groups Cincinnati saw strong startup growth in 2015, index shows NBC News profiles Cincinnati's Mortar program

Chief Executive Officer John Hendrickson says an activist investor’s proposal to sell off the drugmaker’s generics unit, which last year generated 20 percent of its $5.35 billion in revenue, isn’t as simple as it sounds. “It ties into everything we do -- the production, the supply, the shipping, the materials, the bottles, the caps,” he said Thursday in an interview at the company’s Allegan, Michigan, operating headquarters. “We share plants” with the consumer health business.   Hendrickson, 53, is reviewing Perrigo’s portfolio as he settles into his seventh month on the job. Already he’s is under pressure from the activist investor, Starboard Value LP, which  disclosed last month that it held a 4.6 percent stake. The hedge fund criticized the company for mistakes made since the drugmaker rebuffed Mylan NV’s takeover bid almost a year ago and urged it to consider a sale of its prescription medicine unit as well as a royalty interest in multiple sclerosis therapy Tysabri. Hendrickson, who’s trying to boost Perrigo shares that have plummeted 55 percent since their April 2015 peak, hasn’t decided whether generics will remain. Pricing pressures that have made the business challenging in the past two years aren’t likely to get easier, he acknowledged. Yet he also likes the business because generics are profitable.  “Do we have to get it bigger to survive? Can we compete?” he asked. “Those are the challenges.” Activist Investor Hendrickson declined to comment on Starboard’s demands, though he said company executives met with the fund managers, as they would with any stockholder.  “We’ve had those conversations, but it’s been the same sort of discussions that we’ve had with the broad base of our shareholder group.” Speaking Thursday on Bloomberg TV, Starboard’s Jeff Smith said, “We have had discussions as it relates to the prescription business, and whether that really does fit or does not fit. We do want to understand the operational elements. Our view is that it is something that probably could be separated and create value for shareholders.” Smith later said, “I don’t think they are over-levered, but I do think there is an opportunity to be able to take down some of the debt.” Hendrickson said his review of the company’s operations inevitably overlaps with Starboard’s take. He’s also acknowledged that Tysabri isn’t part of its core business. He doesn’t agree with everything in Starboard’s letter, but “there wasn’t an ‘Oh wow, we didn’t think about looking at that one.’” He also said Perrigo has enough cash to meet its $5.5 billion in debt obligations. Over-the-Counter Drugs Perrigo, which keeps a legal address far from small-town Allegan, in Dublin, is the world’s largest producer of over-the-counter drugs and mostly makes store-brand versions of cold and allergy medicines. From 2009 to 2014 it more than doubled annual revenue to $4.17 billion. Its $13 billion market valuation has dropped from $23.3 billion two years ago but dwarfs the $1.5 billion it was worth in 2006, when Joe Papa became CEO. Hendrickson began his career at Procter & Gamble and joined Perrigo in 1989. He rose through the ranks, running operations and supply chain for eight years before becoming president late last year. When he walks through the company’s plants on its 2-million-square-foot campus, he greets workers by their first names, bumps fists to say hello and can explain the manufacturing process in as much detail as a white-coated engineer. Serial Acquirer The company was a acquisition machine under Papa, gobbling up at least a dozen companies. From March 2009 to April 2015, the shares soared 10-fold. In 2013, the company acquired Elan Corp. for $8.6 billion, gaining a lower tax rate and the Tysabri revenue. A $4.5 billion acquisition of Omega Pharma NV in 2014 allowed Perrigo to expand its international presence and grow its over-the-counter sales in Europe. Still, Hendrickson has no plans to resurrect Perrigo’s reputation as a serial buyer.  “My vision is we have a lot of good operating solid parts,” he said. “We’re a good business. We’ve got to focus on operating them, delivering value from all of those parts, making sure they’re clicking with high precision across the board.” Speaking in the company’s boardroom, Hendrickson said he’s interested in buying companies that align with its existing divisions and likely cost about $1 billion or less. Perrigo isn’t planning to “buy the next $10 billion thing” and plans to leave or downsize in some European markets, not expand into new ones. He’s also running Omega differently, better integrating it into the business. In his first week, he replaced two top managers in Europe. “It’s going to take a lot of work to get it to perform the way we have it set up in the U.S.,” which generates higher profit margins. Doesn’t Blame Papa In August, Perrigo lowered its full-year sales guidance as the company struggled, sending its stock plummeting. Hendrickson said at the time that Perrigo would set “realistic” forecasts, though he said Thursday that Papa isn’t responsible for its current condition.  “I personally don’t blame Joe for where we’re at. There’s been a lot of circumstantial changes that have impacted it,” he said. He said that the reduced 2016 guidance includes a drop in operating income of about $250 million because of price erosion in generics. “I don’t know where to get that $250 million of earnings overnight,” he said. “There’s not this slam dunk that says boy, now you’re there.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Oct 27, 2016 at 7:32PM For several years running, Unilever (NYSE:UL) has conducted a global rationalization of its many brands and products under the general assumption that reducing complexity can boost profits. In this segment from Industry Focus: Consumer Goods, Motley Fool analyst Vincent Shen is joined by senior Fool.com contributor Asit Sharma to discuss what this undertaking looks like on the manufacturing side and the impact SKU reduction can have on the supply chain. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 12, 2016. Asit Sharma: One of the ways that Unilever and other companies benefit once they trim those SKUs is that their manufacturing setups become more profitable. So again, some learning today -- companies have what are called manufacturing lines. That is, when you go into a plant you can imagine that not every product has its own manufacturing line, else we would have factories taking up most of the square footage on Earth. But similar products lines and manufacturing setup is a process of preparing several products to run through lines either individually or ganged up together. So if you can take, to use an example, a package of cereal and reduce the sizes of those boxes or the numbers of sizes that you offer, that is, then you can make that one manufacturing setup, which is there to produce those boxes, more profitable. And those of you who are familiar with manufacturing will understand that the company itself may have part of the manufacturing process, but every multinational conglomerate has to work with a series of smaller suppliers and they have their own manufacturing setups to produce one product. So you can see this trimming of SKUs reducing the complexity of the operation, and this is a big thing that industry people talk about. It's not just shrinking or reduction, it's the reduction of complexity, and Unilever is really bent on doing that. Vincent Shen: Yeah, I think ... let me just jump in there really quick. The thing that really surprised me is when they talk about this project, the fact that the amount of work that they had to do with their partners. It wasn't just this internal process that the right managers in departments could implement unilaterally. They had to work with their marketing teams that had previously invested resources and time into certain projects, excuse me, and products and SKUs. And then also their retailers, for example, you know the companies that they distribute their products to are concerned about making sure their shelf space is the way they want it to be. And that the products that Unilever is providing them -- you know a huge supplier, I'm sure, for a lot of these retailers -- that basically they can still optimize their shelf space, what they keep in stock, in their stores based on these changes. And some of them very radical that Unilever was making. Sharma: That's an excellent point. We're going to talk about our second company, Procter & Gamble, in a moment, but P&G's CEO recently made that point on an analyst call, and he said that when they talk with their retail partners, that's one of the major things that CEOs of their retail partners are telling them is, "Hey, reduce this complexity." And you know, we're in a political season. Elections are coming up next month, and one of the things we can extrapolate from what you just said, Vince, is that this can be a really political process. You can imagine if a marketing team has worked two years on an innovation and another management part of the company looks at this product that marketing team has pushed forth and realizes that logistically it's very hard to produce, and you have teams tussling over whether a product stays or goes. And the companies which are successful at SKU rationalization understand that they, at the end of the line, are responsible to shareholders, to earnings per share. So they have to make some tough decisions, and this often means reducing suppliers. I'm going to give you another eye-opening statistic. We talked about Unilever reducing SKU count by as much as 20% as a multiyear goal. The company also wants to reduce the number of its suppliers by 35%. And these two goals are related; it may be a little scary to have a revenue concentration with a huge corporation like Unilever or a smaller sub-manufacturer and understand they are looking, not just to trim the SKUs, but to trim the number of people they work with. But again, this serves shareholders' interests, it reduces complexity, and reducing complexity reduces costs, which boosts net income at the end of the day.

Rudd: Stocks the best investment to increase wealth Lauren Rudd, For USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin 9:37 a.m. CDT October 27, 2016 Lauren Rudd (Photo: Submitted ) 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE “When this old world starts a getting me down...,” (James Taylor, 1998) While a variety of scary ghosts and goblins will soon be knocking on your door asking for treats, none will appear to be scarier than Wall Street. Or to view James Taylor’s words from an investment perspective, the Street’s merciless volatility is getting you down. As both an economist and Wall Street analyst, I am increasingly concerned over the continued decimation of investor confidence brought about by an unadulterated fear of the markets. Do not despair, I have an answer you might find extremely useful in today’s capricious investment climate. However, let me preface what follows with the mantra that stocks are and always have been the best investment for increasing your wealth. The key questions of course are what to buy and when. The last point is easy, anytime. Therefore, the only remaining issue is which companies do you invest in? Here is a short-cut. I am reminded to bring it up every year because it is part of my teaching curriculum. Suppose for a moment you had a list of about 284 solid, high quality, dividend paying companies that have withstood the test of time, would that help? Such help is available by means of the Mergent Handbook of Dividend Achievers and it remains, in my opinion, the single most useful tool for individual investors. I was once asked the question that if you took away my computer systems, access to the Internet, my telephone and only allowed me the use of one item with which to select investment candidates, what would it be? This book would be my answer. In fact, at one time I was quoted on the back cover making just that statement. No, I do not have, and never have had, any financial ties to Mergent, although as a matter of complete disclosure they do offer my students a student discount. The book profiles those companies that have increased their regular annual cash dividend for a minimum of 10 consecutive years. Less than 10 percent of all listed dividend paying companies make the Dividend Achievers list. If a company misses a year, it is off the list and must again increase dividends for 10 consecutive years to be added back on. Mergent is not content to simply list the stellar dividend performers. Rather it takes the list and proceeds to slice and dice it in a variety of ways. For example, it ranks the entire list by total return based on 1, 3 and 5 year increments. It lists the top 20 companies in 12 different categories such as total assets, return on assets, return on equity and dividend yield. Yet, the various lists comprise only about 50 pages of the book. The remaining pages are devoted to a detailed description of each company, including 6 years of annual financial data along with the two most recent quarters and a chart of stock prices covering a 10-year period. I have been using and writing about the Handbook for over 24 years and I believe it to be one of the few remaining bargains in the arena of independent investment research. Moreover, you do not need any form of assistance to benefit from what Mergent has put together. Some of the companies discussed in this column were initially brought to my attention via the Handbook. If you are interested in knowing which company has the longest record for increasing its dividend every year, it is a two-way tie. American States Water and Procter & Gamble have been increasing their dividends for 62 consecutive years. And you say you cannot figure out what to invest in. What do I not like about the book? First, Mergent has become quite commercial with what used to be a relatively inexpensive investment tool. While not prohibitive, the price is also not what I would call inexpensive. The other point is relatively minor but annoying. The print is rather small. This is a result of having to incorporate as much data as possible in a relative small space. Personally, being a bit long in tooth I keep a magnifying glass nearby, just in case. If you would like to obtain a single copy or a subscription, contact Mergent at 1-800-342-5647. Mention I sent you to them and maybe they will offer you a discount. Lauren Rudd is a financial writer and columnist. You can write to him at LVERudd@aol.com.

The incumbent Republicans said they have kept spending down and are proud of the county's AAA-bond rating.  All four candidates running for a seat on the county freeholder board had a chance to tout their accomplishments and lay out their views at a debate Wednesday night sponsored by the Monmouth County League of Women's Voters.  No matter what the topic discussed, the two Democratic candidates, Matthew Doherty and Sue Fulton, seemed to find a way to bring the discussion back to taxes.  "Taxes in Monmouth County are out of control, we all know that," Doherty said. "It's time to put a lid on it."   Doherty, who is the mayor in Belmar, said taxes in the borough haven't gone up in six years.  DiMaso instead pointed to the county budget and explained how it's dropped from $491 million in 2011 to $469 million this year — a $22 million savings, she said. "We did cut taxes $4.5 million last year," she said. "The year before we raised them somewhat because we have a AAA-bond rating — one of 33 in the country and the only one in New Jersey. We have that bond rating because of the way we handle our finances."  More importantly, Freeholder Director Tom Arnone said, is capital expenditures in the country are down more than $50 million. He also noted the shared services agreement between 52 towns in the county "It's something that we're very proud of," he said. "It's very unique. It's very much looked at across the state."  Democratic candidate Sue Fulton said her experience as a businesswoman will help her take a "sharper pencil" to eliminate duplication and areas of waste in the county budget.  "Our opponents are proud of keeping the budget level, but it needs to be cut," Fulton said.  Doherty, 43, and Fulton, 57, of Asbury Park, are vying to become the first Democrats elected to the Republican-controlled Board of Chosen Freeholders since Amy Mallet of Fair Haven was elected in 2008. That was the same year Democrats took control of the board for the first time in 23 years. Doherty is currently serving his second term as mayor of Belmar. Before that, he served on the borough's council for two terms. Fulton was part of the first U.S. Military Academy at West Point class to admit women before she became a captain. After the military, she went on to have a 25-year career in the private sector, serving as a manager with companies like Procter & Gamble and Merck.  If elected, Republicans would still hold control of the freeholder board.  Arnone and DiMaso, the deputy director, are hoping to get elected for a third and second term, respectively.  Prior to the freeholder debate, Monmouth County Sheriff Shaun Golden, the incumbent, sparred against Democrat Jeff Cantor, a Marlboro councilman and U.S. Army colonel. Both candidates agreed that the two most important issues facing the county are fighting the heroin and opioid problem and keeping the residents safe from terrorism.  Golden said his office has taken a "multi-prong approach" to fighting the heroin epidemic, which includes educating residents and beefing up enforcement. The sheriff said the county has done more to teach students and residents about prescription drugs, including implementing a prescription drug drop off box. The department has also added six K-9 dogs in his time as sheriff, Golden said.  Cantor said he is looking to put together a task force that includes physicians, pharmacists, addicts, treatment specialist, clinical outreach coordinators and law enforcement officers.  "I will not take my eye off the ball when it comes to addressing the heroin crisis," he said.  Alex Napoliello may be reached at anapoliello@njadvancemedia.com.

But the omnipresent social network is resonating with some serious brands, such as car manufacturers, credit card firms and the usual marketing giants in the shape of P&G and Unilever, although unsurprisingly, apart from high PPC spender Booking.com, there are no other travel brands in either of their respective top ten advertising clients (unless you count Walt Disney). Facebook clearly has a long way to go before it makes a significant challenge to the dominant position of its rival down the road in Silicon Valley, but this infographic from e-Intelligence has some great data to illustrate where the pair currently reside in the online advertising ecosystem:   Previous Article Next Article   About the Writer :: Kevin May Kevin is senior editor and a co-founder at Tnooz. He was previously editor of UK-based magazine Travolution and web editor of Media Week UK from 2003 to 2005. He has worked in regional newspapers (Essex Enquirer) and started his career at the Police Gazette at New Scotland Yard in London. He has a degree in criminology, a postgraduate diploma in magazine journalism and publishes his first book - a biography about Depeche Mode - in late-2016.   Tags booking.com facebook Google PPC search engine optimisation SEO Comments Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

As far as ROI is concerned, I personally believe Google is much better then Facebook but Kevin, the reason advertisers still spend on Google and Facebook even with low ROI is they look for long term revenues. Its not one time conversion, once a customer forever a customer thats the way these businesses spend money on advertising Reply 4 years ago   John Pope Very nice InfoGraphic, e-Intelligence & Tnooz. 🙂 Duly (Ever)noted. Key take-away: $1 spent on Google Adwords = $2 Average Revenue for Advertisers $1 spent on Facebook Ads = $3 Average Revenue for Advertisers Therefore, advertising through each channel, on average across all industry segments, delivers a 50% Cost of Sale (CPA) on Google and 33% Cost of Sale (CPA) on Facebook. If that’s actually the case, why does any business utilise either channel, considering the terribly poor ROI? Or have both companies just been that effective in “pulling the wool” over the collective global advertiser’s eyes? Something smells rotten in Denmark – thoughts, anybody? Reply 4 years ago   John Pope @Kevin, It would be great if you could get any of your Google or Facebook contacts to comment on the ROI metric highlighted above. 🙂 A return on ad spend can’t possibly be that bad… or can it? I understand that it’s in both companies’ interests to not be very efficient or effective when delivering audiences to advertisers, but these results are surely too BAD to be true. Are they not? It’s amazing that an advertising platform – Google – that fails approximately 98% of the time is considered THE industry benchmark in our rapidly growing and “efficient” digital economy. Considering their failure rate, is there any wonder how they generated more than $43B in ad revenue last year? I reckon it has to be considered the greatest “confidence game” ever conceived of, and executed, in commercial history – certainly, the most scalable. 😉 Reply 4 years ago   Bridget Holland What’s an average Cost of Sale percentage on advertising overall? I know so many companies who have spent money on newspaper, magazine, radio, TV and not see a good return. I’m not convinced Google and FB are any worse than the rest! How many businesses never got a cent from the Yellow Pages, even before the internet? Also I wouldn’t get too worked up about averages. There are many badly targeted, badly set up campaigns which are never going to make a cent (eg in a recent instance, Google set up a campaign for a local business and didn’t get the location targeting pinned down / use out-of-location negative keywords). Then there are really tightly targeted and managed campaigns (eg careful keyword selection and dynamic landing pages to convert) which will deliver much lower cost of sale percentages. Blame as much with the advertisers as with the advertising channels.

This year, CGT’s annual Tech Trends Report, produced with Gartner, reveals a slight increase to 2.1 percent, up from 1.8 percent in 2014. It may not seem like much of an increase, but new challenges have led to exciting advances in technology for companies to explore. Digital consumers are the primary change agent, compounded by economic changes and shifting demographics.    This webinar will focus on the significant forces driving change and the initiatives that consumer goods imperatives are now exploring to stay competitive.   This interactive discussion will be led by Ed Porter, Consumer Products Research Analyst at Gartner, who will be joined by Andy Walter, Retired VP of IT & Shares Services at Procter & Gamble and Jeff McDaniel of RSi. Ed will review the results of this year’s research and have an open discussion with the panelists.   Moderator: Kara Romanow, Executive Editor, CGT   Speakers: Ed Porter, Consumer Products Research Director, Gartner Andy Walter, VP of IT & Shares Services, Retired, Procter & Gamble Jeff McDaniel, VP Customer Success, Retail Solutions Inc.

This philosophy has also led to staffing changes, including a round of downsizing in the New York office this week. “We have been very vocal and transparent about the exciting transformation underway at Publicis North America,” a spokesperson wrote today in a statement. “This includes making strong moves to continue to better serve our clients. Our New York headquarters office has been leading the way, and with the recent string of new business wins and creative accolades, continues to position for the future. Approximately 3% of our staff is affected.” We began hearing rumors of pending layoffs in September along with varied estimates of how many staffers would be affected. Publicis New York’s new Clive Wilkinson Architects office has no assigned desks, but it does reportedly employ more than 1,000 people, meaning that the 3% number applies to at least 30 individuals. According to our tipsters, the announcements began on Wednesday with more changes allegedly to come. Publicis declined to elaborate beyond the above statement. The primary motivation behind Publicis’ recent moves, which also saw the departure of global chief revenue officer Laura Desmond yesterday, is savings. Last week, the holding company reported that third quarter revenues grew by only 0.2% organically, and observers attributed this slowdown to last year’s loss of several massive media accounts including, most prominently, P&G. That said, Publicis has recently won several pieces of new business including Walmart and USAA. In both of those cases, the Groupe applied the “Power of One” approach and won via “umbrella” units that included Saatchi & Saatchi and several other agencies within the Publicis family. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

The Exelon Corp. subsidiary will build an 8.5-megawatt biomass-fueled generator, lighting and boilers, transformers and controls for a landfill gas electricity generator as well as centralized monitoring of electricity generation and distribution efforts at the Albany, Georgia-based Marine Corps Logistics Base, Constellation said Thursday. Construction is scheduled to be completed by 2018. DCO Energy will provide engineering, procurement and construction services under the project while Schneider Electric will install the system controls. The 3,600-acre logistics base consists of nearly 400 facilities and Marine Corps-operated utility systems such as a 61-mile electrical distribution, 19-mile natural gas distribution, 87-mile storm water, wastewater and potable water lines. “Constellation is proud to support the U.S. Marine Corps’ energy and environmental goals and MCLB Albany’s efforts toward achieving net-zero energy use,” said Gary Fromer, senior vice president of Constellation’s distributed energy business. The Marine Corps, Constellation, NAVFAC, Procter & Gamble, Georgia Power, the Georgia Public Service Commission and the Albany-Dougherty Payroll Development Authority worked together for five years to plan the MCLB Albany’s energy project.
