Leo Burnett and Citizen Relations launched a new spot for Mr. Clean starring actor Kellan Lutz of the Twilight series and The Legend of Hercules. Don’t worry, we had to Google him too. The spot, which arrives on the heels of Leo Burnett reviving the Mr. Clean jingle for the brand, features Lutz in a mock audition for the Mr. Clean role. A casting director comments that it’s a big departure from “the whole teen hearthrob thing” and he explains that he’s been looking for something different. His qualifications for the role? He washes his car after every use, polishes his Teen Choice Awards every single day and has “never had a dirty thought” in his entire life. After initially struggling to adapt to the new character, he impresses the casting director…until she finds out something “too dirty for Mr. Clean.” After the spot’s attempts at meta humor fall flat, it ends with Lutz inviting viewers to try out for the role themselves, directing them to TheNextMrClean.com. In addition to the full-length version online, which stretches the premise well past its breaking point, there’s also a 60-second broadcast version. “This is the second in our series of efforts to go back to our roots,” Kevin Wenzel, associate brand director for Procter and Gamble North America, explained to Adweek. “The first was the new modern version of our jingle television spot, which we launched July 1. It was a well-known jingle that was used to launch the brand. We used it for decades, and it was brought into a more modern context.”  “We will still have our iconic Mr. Clean, but this will be a chance to let a consumer have a little bit of fun and let us have a little bit of fun as well,” Wenzel clarified. “That next Mr. Clean will be helping us generate content, including appearing in a calendar which we’ll be showing online.” The brand will be poring over audition tapes submitted online from today through October 7, as well as hosting a pair of casting sessions in New York and Los Angles, before announcing the contest’s $20,000 winner in mid-October.

Andrés Cardenal (TMFacardenal) Sep 7, 2016 at 9:47AM Image source: Getty Images. Dividend aristocrats are a select group of high-quality dividend stocks. Among other requirements, a company must have increased its dividends for 25 consecutive years or more to be considered a dividend aristocrat. Past performance is no guarantee of future results, but a solid track record of dividend payments can say a lot about the health of a business. On the other hand, many dividend aristocrats have been delivering lackluster dividend growth lately. This includes widely popular dividend stocks such as Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), AT&T (NYSE:T), and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), which are raising their dividends at anemic rates.  The retail giant is asleep On Feb. 18, Wal-Mart announced its most recent dividend increase, raising dividends by $0.01 per share, from $0.49 to $0.50 quarterly. This was the third consecutive year in which Wal-Mart increased payments by only $0.01, so lackluster dividend growth is becoming a trend for the discount retailer. The retail industry is aggressively competitive, and things are tougher than ever for brick-and-mortar operators because of increasing pressure from online players in the past several years. Wal-Mart is actively investing in people and technology to expand its online presence, and the company recently announced the acquisition of Jet.com for $3.3 billion to gain ground in e-commerce. Management is doing the right thing by putting the company's long-term strategic position above current profit margins. However, investments for online growth are taking a toll on profit margins, and consolidated operating income excluding the sale of Chinese e-commerce marketplace Yihaodian declined 7.2% last quarter. The stock is paying a dividend yield of 2.7% at current prices, a premium over an average dividend yield of 2.3% for companies in the S&P 500 index. In addition, Wal-Mart has a conservatively low dividend payout ratio of around 46% versus earnings forecasts for the current year, so dividend sustainability is not in question. However, as long as earnings remain under pressure, chances are that Wal-Mart will continue raising its dividends at a modest rate over the middle term.  Connectivity problems AT&T stock is paying an attractive dividend yield of 4.7% at current prices. On the other hand, the company has raised dividends by only $0.01 annually since 2009. These minuscule dividend increases are barely enough for AT&T to retain its status as a dividend aristocrat, but the company is really not offering much in terms of dividend growth. The telecom business is going through massive challenges since internet and related technologies are reducing communications costs across the board, which is putting considerable pressure on different industry operators. AT&T acquired DirecTV in 2015, and the company is now the biggest provider of pay TV services around the world. However, the pay-TV industry is also facing a major threat because of cord-cutting and the online streaming revolution, so AT&T is on the wrong side of major technological trends in its two main businesses. Wall Street analysts are on average estimating that AT&T will produce $2.86 in earnings per share during the current year. This puts the dividend yield at nearly 67% versus earnings expectations. Unless the company can materially accelerate earnings growth over the middle term, this doesn't allow much room for rapid dividend increases going forward. A business in transition Procter & Gamble made a series of mistakes over the past several years. The company entered too many markets, and product innovation didn't work out as expected. This produced a stagnation in revenue growth at the consumer-staples giant.  In order to jump-start performance, the company is transforming itself into a nimbler and more flexible organization. Procter & Gamble has sold nearly 100 underperforming brands over the past couple of years, and the company is embarked on an ambitious cost savings program. In cost of goods sold alone, Procter & Gamble has achieved over $7 billion cumulative savings since 2012. This transformation will probably be a good thing for investors in Procter & Gamble over the long term, but dividend growth has materially decelerated lately. The company raised dividends by 1% in 2016, a considerable slowdown from 3% dividend growth in 2015 and 7% in 2014. The dividend payout ratio is in the area of 70% versus earnings estimates for 2016, so the company will need to improve earnings growth if it's going to revitalize dividend payments in the future. The dividend yield is above average, though, in the area of 3.05%. The Foolish bottom line Don't get me wrong: Dividend aristocrats such as Wal-Mart, AT&T, and Procter & Gamble are solid and dependable dividend stocks, and they're good candidates for investors looking for defensive plays and current income. On the other hand, those looking for vigorous dividend growth should focus on younger companies with superior potential for expansion over the coming years.

The conference focused on understanding consumer shopping trends and discussing the future of online grocery, and resulted in insightful thought-sharing by the industry’s big-name, digital pioneers. In attendance were some of North America’s largest grocery retailers, including Albertsons, Giant Eagle and Wakefern, as well as representatives from top CPG brands including Pepsico, P&G, The Hershey Company and General Mills. Conversations revolved around untapped opportunities for grocers and CPG brands to come together to develop a sustainable eCommerce presence for the industry. Throughout the event, common threads in dialogue focused on the evolving ways to engage with consumers, best practices for leveraging emerging digital channels and the importance of collaboration within the industry.

Discussions also focused on how grocers and brands can ensure an eCommerce channel is built to scale; and, how the two groups should work together to craft innovative omnichannel experiences for their customers. “It was thrilling for MyWebGrocer to have top industry leaders participate in groundbreaking thought-sharing regarding the future success of the online grocery industry,” said Eric Healy, President of MyWebGrocer. “Our team enjoyed spending time with our customers in person, and listening to their ambitions for the marketplace.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Pet Wants Launches in East Cincinnati Pet Wants Launches in East Cincinnati Posted on September 8, 2016 by Benzinga Full Feed in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer The company originally founded in OTR now delivers to eastern Cincinnati thanks to new franchisee Pam Brisley. Cincinnati, OH (PRWEB) September 08, 2016 When Pam Brisley feeds her dogs, she wants to make sure Carmela and Rosco are getting kibble that’s nutritious and fresh. That’s why she switched her pups to Pet Wants. Now Brisley is excited to announce that she has opened her own Pet Wants business to deliver that quality food to pet families in the eastern Cincinnati region. Pet Wants’ carefully developed proprietary pet food is slow-cooked with fresh, all-natural ingredients. The company has their distributor make the dog and cat food in small batches once per month so every kibble is guaranteed to be fresh and packed with nutrition. Pet Wants East Cincinnati is a franchise of the Pet Wants Franchising Systems and the mobile service delivers to Blue Ash, Camp Dennison, Evendale, Landen, Loveland, Maineville, Milford, Montgomery, Morrow, Newtown, and Terrace Park. “I’ve been drawn to animals since I was a young child. My maternal grandparents were farmers, and my paternal grandparents were huge dog lovers. So, on both sides, I was always surrounded by animals. That experience taught me about proper care and, when I met with the Pet Wants team, I was impressed by the mission to offer fresh, natural, locally-sourced dog and cat food, and their goal to educate consumers on how critical good nutrition is to drive superior pet health,” Brisley said. I thought I knew a fair amount about pet nutrition until I, myself, was educated by the Pet Wants team. I’ve learned a great deal about what pets need to thrive, and can’t wait to share that information with my customers.     “I had never imagined myself owning a business – let alone it being something with animals – and I’m thrilled to bring this service to the East side of Cincinnati. I’m proud to share what makes Pet Wants the unique, stand-out brand it is in the market today,” she added. Prior to opening Pet Wants East Cincinnati, Brisley spent her career in the corporate arena, most recently at Procter & Gamble where she spent 17 years working across Consumer & Market Knowledge, Communications and Quality Assurance. She’s also an active volunteer with the Cincinnati Pet Food Pantry, which provides supplemental pet food to lower income families once per month, and drives for local dog rescue transports every week. Brisley lives in Walnut Hills with her dog, Carmela Soprano, a 5.5 YO Olde English Bulldog, and new rescue, Rosco P. Coltrane, a young Basset/German Shorthaired Pointer mix. “When most people buy pet food, they are just grabbing a bag off the shelf based on packaging or a TV commercial they saw. Pet Wants offers a more personal touch. I want to be a resource for pet families. I want them to know that, whether they end up going with Pet Wants or not, I am here to talk about our food, pet nutrition and health and any other pet-related concerns on their minds. That, combined with our quality food and convenient free delivery service, is what really sets us apart,” Brisley said. In addition to being made fresh monthly, Pet Wants only sources the best salmon, chicken, lamb, brown rice and other ingredients available. There’s no sugar added, no fillers and no animal by-products. And, since Pet Wants never uses corn, wheat, soy or dyes, the food is a great fit for pets with allergies. Pet Wants originally launched in Cincinnati in 2010. Owned by Michele Hobbs, the business was built to provide proprietary crafted, fresh, slow-cooked, all-natural pet food delivered to customers through a retail store and a convenient home-delivery service. Hobbs, now the company founder, turned the business into a franchise in 2015 with the help of Franchise Funding Group, an investment and franchise-development company designed to help entrepreneurs scale their companies nationally as franchise systems. To order Pet Wants food for your favorite companion or to learn about the company, call (513)751-PETS(7387), email PBrisley@PetWants.com, visit http://www.PetWantsCincyEast.com and like Pet Wants Cincy East on Facebook. Also keep an eye out for future Pet Wants “Pup Up” events in the East Cincinnati area! About Pet Wants: Pet Wants was started by Michele Hobbs out of love for her pets and frustration. Veterinarians were unable to help relieve her dog’s painful skin allergies. After doing much research, Michele discovered the national dog food brand she trusted was not fresh, not all natural, and lacked sufficient nutrition…and when pet food sits in warehouses and store shelves for months and months… it loses even more nutritional value. She was committed to developing a better solution for all dogs and cats. Their food is exclusively crafted… fresh, healthy, slow-cooked and all natural with no sugar added, no fillers and no animal by-products. They source only the best salmon, chicken, lamb, brown rice, and other ingredients. Fresh ingredients make for better food… and better health for pets. And since they never use corn, wheat, soy or dyes, the common pet health problems associated with these ingredients are no longer worries. Their fresh food is conveniently delivered to the customer within weeks of production, not months. Roughly half of Pet Wants products are sold through their store and half through their convenient, home-delivery program. You can learn more at http://www.PetWants.com.

Lowdown: NFL Splits Auto Sponsors as Ford Joins Hyundai in Three-Year Deal Published on September 07, 2016. Ford is now the official truck of the NFL: Ford's Mark Laneve, NFL Hall of Famer Anthony Munoz and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell Credit: The Ford Motor Company The Lowdown is Ad Age's weekly look at news nuggets from across the world of marketing, including trends, campaign tidbits, executive comings and goings and more. Hyundai's reign as the NFL's only automotive sponsor ended today when Ford announced a three-year deal as the official truck of the NFL. Hyundai's four-year deal began last year when the Korean brand replaced General Motors, which had sponsored the NFL since 2001. Splitting categories into two like this is unique, but not unprecedented in professional sports. For instance, the Los Angeles Rams recently announced a deal to make Corona its official imported beer, while Bud Light is expected to remain as the team's domestic beer sponsor. Hyundai's fleet is dominated by cars. While it sells crossovers and SUVs, it does not sell trucks, making the NFL's deal with Ford a little less threatening. "There is not a lot of overlap between a Hyundai Santa Fe customer and a Ford F-150 customer. If there was, that is where it might get a little bit problematic," said Jim Andrews, senior VP-marketing for sponsorship consultancy IEG. A Hyundai spokesman said the automaker has known there would be a truck sponsor since day one. "Like Hyundai, Ford recognizes the value in being an NFL sponsor and reaching the millions of passionate fans who are gearing up for the start of the season tomorrow," the spokesman said. "We are extremely pleased with how our sponsorship has unfolded so far and have some exciting plans for year two. As the official car, SUV and luxury car of the NFL, we have exclusivity in the categories where Hyundai sells vehicles." Ford's deal includes a "Built Ford Tough Offensive Line of the Week award." Ford also plans to run a "Built Ford Tough Tailgate Tour." Stated Ford: "These experiences will give consumers access to their own Built Ford Tough Tailgates on demand on game day, as well as hard-to-get game tickets." Could the deal also mean Ford might advertise in the Super Bowl? The spokeswoman said there is "nothing to share on Super Bowl yet." Turning to brand mascot news … Mr. Clean usually has been an animated figure during his 57 years on TV, which helps limit SAG-AFTRA payments and keeps him out of trouble after hours, but the Procter & Gamble Co. brand, fresh off reviving the iconic jingle, is going out on a limb by issuing an open casting call for a live-action Mr. Clean to appear in a limited-edition 2017 calendar. A teaser video featuring Twilight star Kellan Lutz failing his audition directs would-be applicants to details at TheNextMrClean.com. "We found Mr. Clean has such a strong heritage and we hadn't necessarily been taking best advantage of that," said Kevin Wenzel, associate brand director. "Phase one was revitalizing the jingle, which has gotten off to a phenomenal start." Sales have accelerated in the seven weeks since the new jingle in three languages came out, and Mr. Wenzel hopes for a similar boost from publicity surrounding a new Mr. Clean. While the gig, which comes with a $20,000 prize, initially just includes the calendar appearance, he said it could ultimately work into other advertising or public appearances. Where does mayonnaise come from? Unilever is trying to answer that with two video spots that included a live-stream from a real Hellmann's Canola Farm in Canada. Launched in Canada, it's the first North American work for Unilever from Cubocc New York, an offshoot of a Brazilian agency and part of Interpublic's Flagcx "creative disruption network," which bills itself as a "post advertising agency." The agency was also responsible last year for Axe's "Romeo Remix" in Brazil, a modern remake of the Romeo and Juliet story with thousands of versions served to people programmatically based on such things as their taste in music or movie genres. A week after abandoning its plan to buy Hershey, Mondelez International is making chocolate plans on its own. On Wednesday, Mondelez said it will pursue a major expansion into the U.S. chocolate market. Those plans include marketing an Oreo Milka chocolate bar in the United States, a product that's already a hit for the company elsewhere. Oreo Milka 300g Bar Credit: Mondelez International Mondelez already sells the Milka with Oreo product in about 20 markets, including Germany. And It is branded as Cadbury Dairy Milk with Oreo in big Cadbury markets such as the U.K. and Australia. "With our strong brands and global expertise in chocolate, we see enormous potential to grow our U.S. business and expand the category," Chief Growth Officer Tim Cofer said in a statement. Other U.S. plans include expanding its higher-end Green & Blacks line. Mondelez is currently a distant 8th in the U.S. chocolate confectionery market with 1.7% market share, well below leader Hershey's 31.6% share, according to Euromonitor International. Globally, Mondelez ranks second behind Mars, with 13.6% market share. JC Penney plus-size clothing collection Credit: JC Penney In advance of New York Fashion Week, which begins Thursday, JC Penney hosted its own runway show on Tuesday outside its Manhattan store. The live-streaming event, which highlighted looks from the retailer's new plus-size clothing collection from "Project Runway" winner Ashley Nell Tipton, was open to the public and included a "braid bar" hair-styling outpost, photo booth with a cardboard cutout of Ms. Tipton, and "bold lip" salon for passersby. The Plano, Texas-based retailer also debuted a three-part video series about the collection in late August. After a decade as CEO, Hormel's Jeffrey Ettinger plans to retire from that role on Oct. 30. Mr. Ettinger will remain chairman of the board, while Hormel President and Chief Operating Officer James Snee will become the Spam maker's next CEO as of Oct. 31. Mr. Ettinger, with Hormel since 1989 and CEO since 2006, helped the company grow in part through a series of acquisitions, including this year's purchase of the Justin's brand. He was the eighth leader to oversee Hormel's longstanding relationship with BBDO. In 2013, Mr. Ettinger spoke highly of BBDO Minneapolis when the marketer and agency won the gold in Ad Age's first agency-client-marriage contest. Contributing: E.J.

Mumbai: Mindshare, the Group M agency, managed to secure the agency of the year title at the 16th edition of The EMVIES Awards on Friday. The agency has picked this title eight times in the last 16 years, winning the top spot from 2008-2016, with the exception of one year—2014, when it lost the title to sister agency, Maxus. The agency took home a total of one Grand Emvie (the only one awarded on Friday evening), eight gold, eight silver and 15 bronze metals. “The awards are a direct result of the effort and hard work put in by each and everyone in the team. We at Mindshare believe in recognizing our employees’ skills and commitment, which is further driven to a level of aspiration that leads to rewarding experiences such as the Emvies. Winning these awards by such a large margin is not only a testimony to our accomplishments so far, but also significantly adds to the quality of service we intend to deliver. Creating ground-breaking innovations and strategies has been Mindshare’s forte and this has kept us at the forefront in the industry,” said Prasanth Kumar, CEO South Asia, Mindshare alluding to the agency’s total score of 395 points. Mindshare was followed by Lodestar UM, which amassed a total of 135 points, with six gold, three silver and three bronze metals. Maxus, also a GroupM company, shared the second place with a score of 135 points including four gold, five silver and five bronze metals. Hindustan Unilever Ltd took home the client of the year award, followed by Pepsico India Holdings Ltd in the second place and Procter & Gamble India Ltd in the third place. Mindshare took home the only Grand Emvie awarded on Friday night for their work for Pepsico India, under the best integrated campaign category for consumer products. The campaign, titled ‘Crash the Pepsi IPL’, was an initiative where the brand invited consumers to create ads for the product and share it. The five best entries were then picked by consumers themselves. The initiative received over 2,600 entries, 900 of which were shortlisted. This pool was further filtered down to 33 finalists, of which five ads were judged winners. The agency also picked up numerous awards for their work for HUL’s Brooke Bond Red Label tea brand, the six pack band—India’s first transgender band, among others. The idea, which was created jointly by the brand team at HUL, Mindshare and Y-Films, picked up six gold, one silver and two bronze metals. The golds were won for best innovation in—branded content, digital social media, radio and digital multiple platform, best media strategy—consumer products and the best use of Bollywood celebrity. Incidentally, this campaign also won India a Glass Lions Grand Prix at the 63rd International Festival of Creativity in Cannes. The Glass Lion category was introduced to celebrate culture-shifting creativity that positively impacts gender inequality, imbalance and injustice. “I must first of all congratulate our clients who push us to keep raising the bar year after year. Clients who believe in innovation and back our teams to take risks are the ones who win and in turn help us win,” said C.V.L. Srinivas, CEO, GroupM South Asia. Lodestar UM won four gold awards for their inspiring work for the Door Step School, a non-governmental organization that was established with the aim of addressing literacy in marginalised sections of society. The campaign saw them naming no-name alleys and narrow lanes in the slums after children who had done well academically or had risen above their circumstances to achieve something. This was used as a way to motivate the children to stay in school and do better, as well as create role models for others to follow. “While this project was difficult to execute as it involved obtaining permissions from the civic authorities, educational department, political parties, local corporators, among others, it was a unique and innovative initiative to celebrate these symbols of societal change. It was to about inspiring them to continue their education and do something they could be proud of,” said Dhruv Jha, GM, IPG Mediabrands. The agency also won two golds for their work for Salaam Bombay Foundation, wherein they created future resumes for three little girls who each aspired to become a lawyer, chartered accountant and an engineer. The agency got human resources (HR) and recruitment firms on board and sent out the resumes to potential employers were surprised to find a little girl, with her future resume. They appealed to companies urging them to help so they could complete their education and actually go on and pick the career of their dreams. The EMVIES Awards, conducted by The Advertising Club (TAC India), recognises outstanding work done by media agencies. With over 29% increase in agency participation, the awards have further grown in impact and inclusivity, said a statement from the industry body. The 2016 awards were adjudged by an eminent jury of 225 media and marketing professionals through judging sessions held in Mumbai and Delhi. “In today’s day and age of extensive media exposure, the greatest challenge is to create clutter breaking communication that is impactful, optimal and delivers the brand message. As always this year too at the EMVIES we have seen works by media agencies that have not only been pioneering and engaging but also helped change mindsets and helped drive resonance for the brand,” said Punitha Arumugam, chairperson, EMVIES committee.

Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) got a much-needed shot in the arm in after-hours trading on Tuesday, when it was announced that Pershing Square Capital Management has purchased 9.9% of the burrito chain. Chipotle's stock is "undervalued and is an attractive investment," says Pershing. Pershing Square is one of the best known hedge funds in the world thanks to its founder Bill Ackman. The billionaire investor has assumed an increasingly activist bent over the past few years, most recently stirring a shake-up at consumer-products giant Procter & Gamble that ended in the ouster of its chairman and CEO. He's also been publicly active in attacking Herbalife, calling the multilevel-marketing company a Ponzi scheme and shorting its stock. And earlier this year, Ackman testified before Congress concerning his investment in Valeant Pharmaceuticals, which has drawn fire for raising the price of prescription drugs. By the sounds of it, Ackman's intentions toward Chipotle are friendly, as Pershing Square's regulatory filing announcing the stake compliments both Chipotle and its leaders: "[Chipotle] is a leading fast casual restaurant company that [Pershing Square] believes has a strong brand, differentiated offering, enormous growth opportunity, and visionary leadership." At the same time, Pershing is clear that it intends to engage with Chipotle's leadership: "[Pershing] intends to engage in discussions with [Chipotle] and [Chipotle's] management and board of directors, other stockholders [...] and other interested parties that may relate to the governance and board composition, business, operations, cost structure, management, assets, capitalization, financial condition, strategic plans, and the future of [Chipotle]." It's impossible to say what this means for Chipotle, though I'd be hesitant to assume that Ackman's presence will augur in any type of substantive change in direction for the restaurant chain, which is already capably managed. A more likely outcome is it will just improve investor sentiment toward Chipotle's stock, which of course would be much appreciated. Shares of Chipotle have struggled since a series of foodborne-illness outbreaks at the end of last year caused its sales to fall sharply. In the first quarter of this year, same-store sales at locations open at least a year dropped 29.7%. They improved in the second quarter but were still off by 23.6%. The effect on Chipotle's share price has been significant. After reaching $750 a share in 2015, they fell to as low as $384 last month. Before Pershing's announcement, they were at $414 per share -- down 45% from last year's high. Thus, while the surge in after=hours trading following today's news will only make up a little of this deficit and the gains may be fleeting, it's safe to say that Chipotle investors will take what they can get right about now.

Referred to as the maximum earning potential (MEP), the highest international package offered this year stood at $153,568 against $110,284 a year ago. The highest domestic package, however, fell 10 per cent, according to the audited placement report released by IIM-A on Wednesday. The final placements at IIM-A, held in February this year, saw 383 PGP students along with 46 PGP-ABM (postgraduate programme in agribusiness management) and 67 PGPX (postgraduate programme for management executives) students seeking placements. MEP is the sum total guaranteed cash component, maximum possible-linked variable pay and all other components of salary that are a part of the offer. This can include long-term compensation such as provident fund and other perks as well. Since IIM-A began getting its placement reports audited by a third party like CRISIL and now Brickwork Ratings under the Indian Placement Reporting Standards (IPRS), which looks at standardising placement data, including salary and non-salary information. According to the latest IPRS report, domestic MEP at IIM-A fell from Rs 53 lakh (Rs 5.3 million) during final placements last year to Rs 48 lakh in 2016. Average domestic and international MEP, however, saw reversal of trends where the former rose eight per cent over the previous year while the latter fell 7.7 per cent. During the 2016 final placements held in February at IIM-A, the average domestic MEP stood at Rs 22 lakh against Rs 20 lakh (Rs 2 million) last year, while international average MEP was $73,580 compared to $79,738 in the previous year. Around 110 firms had participated in the final placements for the 2016 batch at IIM-A. In terms of sector-wise recruitments, consulting continued to lead the pack, followed by banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), online services and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), among others. The consulting sector, led by recruiters such as Accenture Strategy, Alvarez & Marsal, A T Kearney, Bain & Co, McKinsey & Co and The Boston Consulting Group recruited 108 students this year against 97 last year. Recruiters in the BFSI, FMCG and e-commerce sectors included the likes of Axis Bank, Bharti AXA, YES Bank, Hindustan Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Amazon, and Flipkart, among others. After making offers, Flipkart had later deferred the joining dates of candidates to as late as December. This triggered a scathing response by IIM-A, which however later softened its stance. Before the final placements, 108 pre-placement offers were also accepted by PGP students at IIM-A. IIM-A’s one-year programme for executives (PGPX) saw the highest and average international MEP fall by 38.26 per cent and 16.33 per cent, respectively. While international MEP fell from last year's $207,581 to $128,160 this year, the average fell from $147,119 to $120,80 for the same period. Domestic MEP for PGPX, too, fell 10.8 per cent, down from Rs 54.6 lakh last year to Rs 43.7 lakh (Rs 4.37 million) this year while the average domestic MEP rose negligibly by 1.18 per cent from Rs 28.8 lakh (Rs 2.9 million) last year to Rs 29.1 lakh this year.

ASU researcher applauds federal rule on antibacterial soaps Gavin Maxwell, Cronkite News 3:59 p.m. MST September 7, 2016 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday issued its ruling on the safety and effectiveness of soaps and washes containing certain antibacterial chemicals. (Photo courtesy of Adriano Gadini via pixibay) (Photo: Adriana Gadini via Creative Commons) PHOENIX – Arizona State University researcher Rolf Halden has been warning the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of the dangers of ingredients found in antibacterial soaps for more than a decade. His research focuses on how man-made pollutants found in personal-care products seep into our natural resources and eventually, our bodies. He said the FDA has been slow to react to the recommendations of environmental scientists, but the agency has finally taken action. On Sept. 2, the FDA issued its ruling on the safety and effectiveness of soaps and washes containing certain antibacterial chemicals. The ruling effectively bans 19 chemical compounds from the popular over-the-counter products. Halden, the director of the Center for Environmental Security at the Biodesign Institute, called it a “public health victory.” “It took over 40 years,” Halden said. “I applaud the FDA for finally ruling on it and ignoring industry lobbying.” Harmful ingredients The FDA’s announcement states that companies can no longer market antibacterial washes containing these ingredients because manufacturers failed to demonstrate that the chemicals are safe for long-term daily use and more effective than regular soap and water in preventing illness. The FDA explained that some research shows long-term exposure to these ingredients, such as triclosan and triclocarban — the most common of the 19 chemicals used — can be harmful to public health. AZCENTRAL Food and Drug Administration bans sale of most antibacterial soap, saying it's pointless, potentially harmful Hand-wash products containing these chemicals go down drains and into water treatment plants, where a considerable amount ends up in our groundwater supply, according to Halden’s research. The chemicals re-enter homes in drinking and bath water. In 2004, Halden and a team of researchers discovered triclocarban pollution in metropolitan areas across the nation. “(Triclosan and triclocarban) are amongst the most abundant man-made pollutants. They are present everywhere, in our drinking water, urine, blood, breast milk and in newborns,” Halden said. The prevalence of these toxins across the U.S. is due to their popularity amongst manufacturers. They have been popular additives to products for more than 40 years. “Right now, the market consists of over 2,100 products and the vast majority of which do contain one of the 19 active ingredients,” said Andrea Fischer, a spokeswoman for the FDA. Cancer among risks  Potential health risks include bacterial resistance, hormonal imbalances and increased chance of cancer, according to Halden’s research. Fischer said the FDA’s ruling sends a message that the potential health consequences of these ingredients outweigh the benefits. However, some manufacturers claim these ingredients help to kill more bacteria than regular soap. These companies have not been able to produce enough scientific evidence to convince the FDA of their claims, Fischer said. Meanwhile, some manufacturers are ahead of the FDA’s new regulation. She said two major manufacturers, Proctor & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson, announced on their websites that they would phase out triclosan in their antibacterial products prior to Friday’s ruling. All manufacturers have one year to comply with the FDA’s new regulation. FDA officials said they hope the rule will curtail the level of toxins across the country. “I certainly can say we detect (the 19 chemicals) wherever we look, and that includes here in Arizona. This ruling will have a local effect in limiting pollutants,” Halden said. “This is something that we are going to monitor to see what the effect of the ban is.” For now, the FDA recommends keeping it simple and sticking to your old school soap and water. 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://azc.cc/2c8g9y8 TOP VIDEOS Zoo's gorilla barrier didn't meet standards when Harambe died 0:47 People formed a human ladder to rescue an man from a river in China 0:36 Marilyn Monroe's iconic dress sell for $4.8 million 1:05 Twitter expected to field offers to buy social media network this week 1:32 Black police group unhappy with political endorsements 0:32 Emu loose on I-10 in Arizona 0:12 First look: Sky Harbor Terminal 3 upgrades 1:23 Halloween 2016 By The Numbers 0:50 Octopus hunts one of the world's most venomous fish 0:35 Kent Somers, Bob McManaman discuss news from Cardinals camp on Friday 2:12 You Can Sleep In Dracula's Coffin Thanks To Airbnb 1:09 Five things that matter to Millennials in the election 1:52 Half-zebra, half-donkey is 100% adorable 0:27 Punchlines: Disenchanted yet? 4:54 Mexico City cartoon exhibit depicts Donald Trump as a Nazi 2:04 Former Jets player killed in crash 0:37 Glenn Beck praises Michelle Obama's speech as incredibly effective 1:15 4 dead when truck plunged off San Diego bridge into crowd below 0:43 What to watch for in Sprint Cup race at Kansas Speedway 1:56 Several women say Trump inappropriately touched them 0:50 Energy-saving tips 1:45 Sustainable building at ASU 2:10 Sedona house destroyed 1:36 Dad's heartfelt Facebook post inspires flood of support from strangers 0:54 Teen Marine surprises his mom after six months away 0:37 Accused school shooter charged with murder, attempted murder 4:29 A Phoenix resident is suing a Pappadeaux restaurant 0:49 Pottermore will tell you what your Patronus is 0:41 5 most memorable Ryder Cup moments 1:11 Trump campaign touts donation windfall after the debate 1:08 This beer is supposed to taste like a burger 1:02 The Republic editorial board's 2016 presidential endorsement 1:07 Pepe the Frog declared a hate symbol by Anti-Defamation League 0:30 More Stories Red table, blue table: Talking turkey at post-election Thanksgiving dinner Nov. 18, 2016, 6:02 a.m. Montini: Is Arpaio off the hook?

This research report titled 'Global Advertising Market 2016-2020' provides an in-depth analysis of the market in terms of revenue and emerging market trends. This market research report also includes an up to date analysis and forecasts for various market segments and all geographical regions. Social media advertising is on the rise, making it mandatory for major vendors to have a significant online presence. Engaging the customers and measuring the performance of an ad is easy on social media. Advertisers, thus, regularly monitor the performance of social media advertisements to justify the company's investment and request an additional budget for ad-spending. Request a sample report: http://www.technavio.com/request-a-sample?report=53018 Technavio's sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. The report categorizes the global advertising market into four major segments based on medium of advertising. They are: TV advertising Digital advertising Print advertising Out-of-home (OOH) advertising Ask an analyst: http://www.technavio.com/content/ask-analyst?report=53018 Have a question about this market? Ask Technavio's lead analysts a question and they will have your answer within 24 hours. Global TV advertising market The global TV advertising market is expected to reach USD 281 billion by 2020, growing at a CAGR of more than 4% during the forecast period. TV ads are the largest segment of the global ad spending market. They are the most viewed, influential, and favored advertising media in the world. TV advertising reaches mass audiences, and thus will continue to be the dominant advertising segment, despite the growing popularity of digital platforms. "One of the major trends in the market is TV ads with digital touch points. In this, the TV ads include the address of their digital presence in the content so that the viewers can know more about the campaign and product," says Ujjwal Doshi, a lead analyst at Technavio for publishing and advertising research. Including a digital touch point in the TV ad increases its effectiveness by 16%. With online purchases growing at a higher rate than in-store purchases, marketers see this as an opportunity to boost the effectiveness of TV commercials. Advertising is a premium source of revenue for TV broadcasters. TV channels need to increase their market share among viewers to attract companies to advertise on their channels. This is predominant in new TV channels who will have to engage their target audience before advertising revenue takes effect. Global digital advertising market The global digital advertising is expected to reach USD 280 billion by 2020, growing at a CAGR of close to 11% during the forecast period. Digital media is transforming the advertising industry. It is currently the fastest growing marketing technique, and will continue to grow during the forecast period. Earlier, only large corporations opted for digital marketing. However, many start-ups and SMEs have started adopting the digital marketing technique due to the affordability of the platforms. One of the prime factors for the growth of the market is that digital platforms allow user interaction. Moreover, the customer engagement rate and success of these digital campaigns are relatively higher than other marketing strategies. "Digital advertising campaigns also help to acquire new clients and customers. Posts and updates from companies on social media provide them with business insights and the latest news on product launches. Digital platforms like social media are, thus, rapidly becoming important venues for effectively engaging with the target audience," says Ujjwal. Digital advertising, however, is a long-term strategy. ROI can take anywhere between several months to a couple of years before a company benefits from the increased customer loyalty and sales. This factor also makes it difficult for the companies to quantify ROI or forecast profits. Global print advertising market The corporate sector has reduced their print ad spending, which has further resulted in newspaper companies facing budget constraints. Subscription and renewals too have dwindled significantly. However, print advertising does offer several advantages. One of the major advantages is that it sets a standard for advertising in the market. Print advertising holds a niche in the market as very few vendors can afford it. With region specific newspapers, print advertising can also target specific audience effectively. Advertising in newspapers and magazines require large investment of time, personnel, and money. The cost of a print ad can be significantly reduced if the same content is used in multiple advertising mediums. Ad-spend in the print media is rapidly declining. It accounts for approximately 21% of total advertising expenditure. As of 2015, the global print advertising was valued at close to USD 126 billion. It is expected to reach USD 135 billion by 2020, growing at a CAGR of more than 1% during the forecast period. Global OOH advertising market The global OOH advertising is expected to exceed USD 48 billion by 2020, growing at a CAGR of more than 4% during the forecast period. OOH is one of the oldest advertising mediums, which was deemed as inflexible because of its physical nature and its inability to hit the target. However, in the last 10 years, the medium has become more flexible with technological advances such as increasing adoption of digital outdoor advertising with the ability to interact and engage with customers. Among all the different types of advertising, OOH is the only medium which has complete reach over the target audience. With an increasing number of people spending more time out of their homes, OOH media delivers the brand's message continually across consumers of various demographics in their daily routine. One of the major factors influencing the effectiveness of an OOH advertising campaign is its placement. It varies from that of a billboard on the road to the placement of an ad during the break at Super Bowl stadium. Another challenge is the low amount of ad-spent on OOH media for the amount of time individuals spend outdoors. An individual is exposed to outdoor advertising nearly 24% of the time, but only about 7% of the total advertising expenditure is dedicated to this segment. However, during the forecast period, the disparity between time spent and ad-spend for outdoor advertising is expected to reduce. The top vendors highlighted by Technavio's media & entertainment research analysts in this report are: American Express Ford Pfizer P&G Verizon Browse Related Reports: Global Internet Advertisement Market 2016-2020 Global Advertising Display Market 2016-2020 Global Programmatic Advertising Spending Market 2016-2020 Do you need a report on a market in a specific geographical cluster or country but can't find what you're looking for?

Among the various regional markets, the market in Asia Pacific accounted for 41.0% volume share in 2015. In terms of value, the global baby diaper market is anticipated to expand at a CAGR of 4.1% during the forecast period and is expected to be valued at US$ 70.4 Bn by 2024 end. Among all product type segments in the baby diaper industry, disposable diapers are projected to be the fastest-growing segment over the forecast period (2016-2024). This segment accounts for approximately 49.0% of the global volume of diapers consumed; attributed to the availability of improved raw materials and technological advancements in markets in various regions across the globe. In Asia Pacific, disposable segment accounted for majority market share of 42.5% in 2015. Revenue contribution of this segment to the APEJ baby diaper market is expected to increase at a CAGR of 6.0% from 2016 to 2024. In North America, a market share of the cloth diaper segment is anticipated to fall from 11.2% in 2015 to 10.8% in 2024. This is due to the introduction of new baby diaper products with more efficient absorbency as compared to that of cloth diapers. In terms of value, the disposable segment in the Europe baby diaper market accounted for 49.4% share in 2015. Demand for baby diapers in countries in this region is primarily driven by increasing number of private labels and increasing the focus on raw material suppliers towards developing biodegradable materials. Download and View Report Table of Content, Figures, and Tables: http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/market-research/baby-diaper-market/toc Primary factors driving growth of the global baby diaper market include increasing promotion and advertising of various baby diaper brands and improved raw materials, and technological advancements. In addition, growing affluence and increased per capita spending on personal hygiene products and increasing birth rates in developing countries are other factors expected to drive growth of the global baby diaper market over the forecast period. Demand for baby diaper across the globe is growing steadily and can be attributed to the various associated benefits such as ensuring increased hygiene and low risk of skin damage. One of the major restraints for a growth of the global baby diaper market is a significantly slow rate of degradation of baby diapers. Diapers rank among the third-largest consumer item to be disposed of in landfills and represent 30% of non-biodegradable waste volumes. Moreover, disposable diapers contain dioxin, which is an extremely toxic by-product of the paper-bleaching process. This factor is anticipated to restrain the growth of the global baby diaper market over the forecast period.

Not doing so could mean a drop in stock prices, a decrease in revenue or worse — bankruptcy or even death. Just take a look at some of the brands that used to be on top but have taken a beating over the years (does the name “Blockbuster” sound familiar?). Fortunately, many of the prosperous and best brands you’ve grown to love have undergone transformations to reinvent themselves and secure your loyalty. Here’s a look at a handful of companies that maintained longevity and their bottom line by rebranding or reinventing themselves. 1. Netflix Today’s younger generation probably doesn’t remember that in the late ’90s to the early 2000s, “Netflix and chill” wasn’t as easy as firing up the laptop, logging into a Netflix account and picking a movie or TV show to binge watch. Instead, Netflix was kind of like an online Blockbuster, more or less. In 1998, Netflix launched the first DVD rental and sales site with Netflix.com. One year later, the company debuted its subscription service, which allowed movie buffs to rent unlimited DVD rentals for a low monthly cost and receive them by mail. It wasn’t until 2007 that Netflix transitioned into online streaming — and it was a smart move. Finally, viewers of all ages would have access to some of their favorite shows and movies, as well as original Netflix content. In fact, in 2013, Netflix nabbed 31 primetime Emmy nominations for its original shows like “House of Cards” and “Orange Is the New Black.” Although the company has received some angry outcries from customers over the years because of changes in pricing, the company has experienced financial success over the long term. For example, Netflix stock was trading at $3.80 at the beginning of 2007. On Sept. 1, 2016, the stock closed at $97.38. These days, it’s safe to say Netflix is considered one of the coolest stocks to invest in. And although the company didn’t grow its subscriber base as much as it wanted to in second-quarter 2016, Netflix did grow its members by 1.7 million. 2. IBM Sure, some might argue that investing in IBM would be a mistake because its revenue has fallen in previous quarters, reported NASDAQ in July. However, NASDAQ also reports the company is “amid a transformation process” and might actually be a good buy. And if there’s only one thing you’ll learn about IBM’s history, it’s that this company knows a thing or two about reinventing itself and keeping pace with ever-evolving technology. Since debuting as the Computing – Tabulating – Recording Company more than 100 years ago, IBM has undergone major transformations. Back then, C-T-R would manufacture and sell various machinery such as commercial scales, industrial time recorders, meat and cheese slicers, and more. And, it wasn’t until 1924 that C-T-R became the International Business Machines Corporation, although it has operated under the name since 1917 in Canada. Fast-forward a few decades to the ’50s and ’60s after Thomas J. Watson Jr. became CEO and “led IBM’s transformation from a medium-sized maker of tabulating equipment and typewriters into a computer industry leader,” according to IBM’s website. In 1964, the company created System/360, which essentially made it possible for machines in a product line to work with each other, making a huge impact in the business world. Less than 20 years later, in 1981, the IBM Personal Computer (IBM 5150) arrived. Although it wasn’t the first-ever PC, people began buying these computers to use in their daily lives. However, the ’80s and early ’90s were rough for the company. According to its website, “IBM was thrown into turmoil by back-to-back revolutions.” The company didn’t properly prepare for the PC revolution, reported NPR in 2011. With the focus on “desktop and personal productivity” instead of business applications, IBM suffered annual net losses that reached the billions — a record of $8 billion in 1993. The company had two options: reinvent or die. So, IBM shifted its focus to IT and consulting, according to NPR. Still, the company has plans to further reinvent itself. In her 2015 chairman’s letter, CEO Ginni Rometty wrote, “Today, IBM is much more than a ‘hardware, software, services’  company. IBM is now emerging as a cognitive solutions and cloud platform company.” Thanks to its transformation, IBM reported its analytics, cloud, mobile, social and security strategic imperative grew by 26 percent and contributed $29 billion in revenue in 2015. 3. Amazon More than 20 years ago, Amazon was a much different company. It’s hard to believe this go-to online retailer that sells everything you could possibly think of — from TVs and computers to groceries and household items — started off as an online book retailer. In 1995, CEO Jeff Bezos sold his first book on Amazon.com, which itself has changed drastically since the mid-90s. Back then, the website contained a lot of blue, hyperlinked text — quite different from the colorful photos and organized categories you’ll see on the site today. But Amazon’s design was practical; the company’s main mission was to sell books, after all. Author Brad Stone — who wrote the book “The Everything Store” about Amazon and Bezos — told NPR in 2013 he thinks Bezos started off selling books because it was “a good place to start: [Books are] small, they ship easily in the mail, the selection that the internet enables was a great strategic advantage over the traditional chain booksellers of the time like Barnes & Noble and Borders.” Indeed, buying books on Amazon was — and still is — easy and even preferable to going to a physical bookstore for many people. Although Amazon experienced success with its book-selling strategy, Bezos reinvented Amazon to sell more than just books. See: 10 Things You Didn’t Know Amazon Can Do for You In 1996, the retailer introduced an affiliate program — known as the Amazon Associates Program — which helped the company expand its reach, reports CBS News. And after announcing its IPO in 1997, Amazon introduced “one-click shopping” and began offering different products and services in various categories: music, DVD/video, home improvement, software, video games, gift ideas, kitchen, and so on. These days, the company is making big money. According to its second-quarter financial results report, net sales hit $30.4 billion — a 31 percent increase compared to second-quarter 2015. Forbes also named Amazon as one of the world’s most innovative companies of 2016. 4. Old Spice Old Spice is no longer associated with “old” or “colonial” men, thanks to successful rebranding attempts. The product — which debuted in 1937 as Early American Old Spice for women and then in 1938 as Old Spice for men — is now a popular men’s grooming brand. But it wasn’t always that way. After experiencing decades of success, Old Spice began to lose sales as competition increased and because it suffered from “an outdated brand image,” found a 2014 case study by the University of Southern California. In June 1990, Procter & Gamble — which owns tons of brands, from Pampers to Gillette — bought Old Spice from the Shulton Company. P&G attempted to rebrand the product, but it wasn’t until Old Spice launched its “Swagger” Campaign in 2008 that it started attracting the younger demographic it needed to compete with other brands, such as Axe, according to the study. Old Spice’s real moment of reinvention, however, came two years later. In 2010, former NFL player Isaiah Mustafa starred in Old Spice’s “The Man Your Man Could Smell Like” campaign. You might remember it: Standing in front of a running shower with nothing but a towel on, Mustafa tells female viewers, “Hello, ladies. Look at your man, now back to me. Now back at your man, now back to me. Sadly, he isn’t me,” and suggests that if their men switch to Old Spice, they could smell like him. When the ad debuted on YouTube during Super Bowl weekend, it became a viral hit. It was simply funny. According to an undated P&G fact sheet that addresses the initial campaign and its sequel “Smell Like a Man, Man,” Old Spice received a 2,700 percent increase in Twitter followers, an 800 percent increase in Facebook fan interaction, a 300 percent increase to the Old Spice website and around 105 million YouTube views. The campaign made an impact on sales as well, though the fact sheet didn’t provide any exact figures. AdWeek, however, reported in July 2010 that overall sales for Old Spice body wash products jumped 107 percent in the last month after two new TV spots and online response videos debuted.

McDonald’s In 2001, the book “Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal” released — and it didn’t have that many nice things to say about fast food giant McDonald’s. In a New York Times book review, Rob Walker wrote, “The aim of his book … is to force [the author’s] readers to stop and consider the consequences of McDonald’s and its ilk having become inescapable features of the American (and, increasingly, global) landscape — to contemplate ‘the dark side of the all-American meal.”’ Although it’s hard to tell if the book’s release directly — or indirectly — hurt McDonald’s reputation and brand in a monetary way, the Wall Street Journal did report in 2003 the restaurant posted its first quarterly loss in 38 years as a publicly traded company. However, the WSJ article said the closing of hundreds of restaurants, restructuring costs and other factors attributed to the huge loss. Nonetheless, McDonald’s food offerings have changed over the years to accommodate the healthy eater. McDonald’s currently offers plenty of healthy options, including salads, low-fat and fat-free milk, fruit and more. Plus, the fast food joint continues to make its nutritional facts available for everyone. No longer is McDonald’s only seen as the go-to place to grab a Big Mac loaded with 500-plus calories; its image is more health-conscious. In addition, McDonald’s has taken steps to reinvent the fast food world by offering “All Day Breakfast” and its McPick 2 menu. According to its second-quarter 2016 results, McDonald’s experienced its “fourth-consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales across all business segments.” And according to Forbes, the fast food giant has a market value of more than $100 billion. 6. Lego Lego has been around since 1932 and for years has been a hallmark toy in many children’s lives. At one point in 2014, Lego even became the top toy company in the world, surpassing Mattel’s Barbie doll, reported the Wall Street Journal at the time. But the Danish toy company wasn’t always a star performer. According to a 2015 Fast Company article titled “How Lego Became the Apple of Toys,” the company was reportedly on the brink of bankruptcy more than 10 years ago. The growth of video games and the internet threatened the toy company, which might’ve been considered as “old-fashioned” in the face of new, innovative toys and games, reports Fast Company. In reaction, Lego reportedly made a few mistakes. However, by cutting costs, improving processes and managing cash flow, the company was on its way to bouncing back. In 2011 came a Lego line called Lego Friends, which helps the brand appeal to young girls and combat the stereotype that only boys can play with the building blocks. But jump ahead to 2014, when “The Lego Movie” hit theaters. The movie and its products really helped Lego get the revenue boost it needed to overshadow Mattel in 2014, according to WSJ. Thanks to innovative products and a successful movie, Lego is now more than just a toy — it’s a cool franchise. According to BoxOfficeMojo, “The Lego Movie” film has grossed more than $460 million worldwide. And according to the company’s 2015 annual report, as reported by Bloomberg, net income reached 9.2 billion Danish kroner in 2015 — the equivalent of $1.34 billion and an increase of about 31 percent. 7. Apple It’s hard to imagine that in late the ’90s, Apple was on the verge of bankruptcy — but it was, reports Business Insider. Fortunately for the company, one of Apple’s biggest competitors — Microsoft — put on the Superman cape and rescued Apple from its collapse by forking over millions of dollars in 1997. According to Bloomberg, Microsoft’s $150 million investment helped Apple get the money it needed to change the technology space. In fact, it might be fair to say that thanks to Microsoft, Apple is now one of the world’s most valuable and innovative brands. After all, Forbes puts Apple’s brand value at $154.1 billion. In comparison, Apple was worth less than $3 billion when Microsoft invested in the company, reports Bloomberg. But give Apple some credit for its success; the company reinvented itself as more than just a Mac maker. Its handheld devices — from iPods to iPhones to iPads — have brought the company to an entirely new level. Apple’s ability to reinvent itself, and truly the product place, can easily explain why it’s consistently considered one of today’s best brands. Apple loyalists are always wondering, “What’s next?” Perhaps that’s why investors, including the famous Warren Buffett, continue to invest in this hot brand.

[steve p2008/Flickr] Print Comments2 DISCLAIMER: All opinions in this column reflect the views of the author(s), not of EurActiv.com PLC. Across Europe, consumers are choosing renewable electricity and are doing so on a large scale. It’s time to recognise this demand for renewable energy by reporting on national consumption, and not only production, of renewables, writes Jared Braslawsky. Jared Braslawsky is secretary-general of Renewable Energy Certificate System (RECS) International. He is a leading expert in the market for guarantees of origin and other electricity tracking instruments. He recently launched the International REC Standard Foundation, which implements and standardises attribute tracking systems around the globe. Dual reporting of renewable electricity can support consumer choice, showing the impact of collective action – and is in line with EU ambitions to empower consumers. According to the European Commission, citizens are at the core of the EU’s most ambitious energy strategy to date, the Energy Union. Today, there is legislation in place that requires national governments to report national figures of renewable energy production. Mandatory reporting of national consumption figures would ensure consumers are also part of the national statistics. This is the first step towards placing the energy consumer in the driver’s seat. If we expect the consumer to play a larger role in the energy transition we must also acknowledge their decision to purchase renewable electricity, and not only measure the production of renewables as we do now. Historically, electricity producers have been centralised, state-owned, top-down entities. The consumer had no choice of supplier, or of the source of their household electricity supply. The legacy of this traditional mode of energy production means that the energy sector is today the only sector where we are measuring the production – and not the consumption – of a commodity. Take electric vehicles for example: to measure real progress on the ground, we count how many electric vehicles are on the road in Norway, not how many are being produced in Germany. Across Europe, consumers are actively choosing renewable electricity and are doing so on a large scale. Last year European consumers made the conscious effort to purchase renewables for more than 550 TWh of electricity, equivalent to roughly 20% of all electricity consumption in Europe. If we include electricity that is not eligible for private consumption – such as German production that receives the feed-in tariff and is consumed equally by all German electricity end-users – nearly 770 TWh of citizen-led renewables was consumed in Europe. Many businesses are already voluntarily reporting their CO2 emissions from electricity usage as part of calculating their annual carbon footprint. One reporting agency alone, CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), had more than 5,500 companies voluntarily reporting their emissions in 2015 – accounting for nearly 17% of global emissions. Linked initiative RE100 supports companies in achieving a public goal to procure 100% of their electricity from renewable sources of energy, and includes global players such as Google, IKEA, Philips, Microsoft, Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble. The demand for renewable energy from these companies and millions of households around Europe is not currently recognised in any European statistics. Shouldn’t we recognise this positive choice for renewable energy in national reporting? CDP companies report CO2 emissions from electricity usage based upon a national/regional production mix (location-based accounting) and a company-specific consumption mix (market-based accounting), a method developed by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. This voluntary dual reporting ensures companies are responsible – for both where they consume electricity, but also, what market choices they make for their company’s electricity consumption. Dual reporting would be similar for national governments: report the national production of renewables and report the national consumption of renewables. Already member states measure national renewables production through the guarantee of origin (GO) instrument defined in the Renewable Energy Directive (Article 15). GOs are electronic certificates issued to renewable energy producers for every 1 MWh of energy produced. The electronic document is used to guarantee to the consumer that the energy delivered is produced from renewable sources. Once the energy is sold, the GO is then cancelled to avoid double counting. Collaboration over the last fifteen years between national regulators, market players, stakeholders and consumers has resulted in a robust and reliable GO system. The European market for renewable energy, documented with GOs, increased by 26.5% in 2014 compared to 2013. In 2014, the demand surpassed 300 TWh for certificates adherent to the European Energy Certificate System (EECS) standard, held by the Association of Issuing Bodies (AIB). This is nearly one tenth of all electricity demand in Europe (approximately 3,300 TWh) and one third of all electricity from renewable sources in Europe (approximately 900 TWh). In 2015, for the first time, an increase in cancellations of GOs, (and therefore of renewable energy demand) together with the decrease in issuing volumes, created a shortage of supply. This scarcity of supply marks a turning point in the development of guarantees of origin, setting the market in a good state for 2016 and the years to come. With limited exceptions, guarantees of origin are issued by members of the Association of Issuing Bodies (AIB) – mostly transmission system operators, electricity regulators and energy market operators. Measuring consumption of renewables based on GOs is therefore relatively simple to implement, and will highlight the increasing demand from consumers and businesses for renewable energy. The European Commission is currently preparing proposals for a new renewable energy directive (REDII) for the period 2020-2030, with a draft anticipated before the end of 2016. It’s not too late to include a dual reporting obligation in the new directive to support the citizens and businesses that are driving the European energy transition and show that collective action can make big changes.

Now we have a case that all consumers are paying this difference in the price. Also renewable electricity are extremely unreliable.

At 14:20 IST, the Sensex was up 25.85 points or 0.09% at 29,003.87. The Nifty was currently down 2.15 points or 0.02% at 8,940.85. The Sensex was currently trading a tad above the psychologically important 29,000 mark. The barometer index has alternately moved above and below that level in intraday trade so far. The market breadth indicating the overall health of the market was positive. On BSE, 1,436 shares rose and 1,174 shares declined. A total of 164 shares were unchanged. The BSE Mid-Cap index was currently up 0.11%. The BSE Small-Cap index was currently up 0.62%. Both these indices outperformed the Sensex. Meanwhile, data released by the stock exchanges showed that foreign funds made substantial purchases of Indian stocks yesterday, 6 September 2016. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought shares worth a net Rs 1438.72 crore yesterday, 6 September 2016, as per provisional data released by the stock exchanges. In overseas stock markets, European stocks were trading higher as investors digested weaker US data which lowered the chances of the US Federal Reserve hiking interest rates later this month. Asian stocks were trading on a mixed note. US stocks closed higher yesterday, 6 September 2016, after surprisingly weak US services sector activity data lowered the chances a Federal Reserve will hike rates this month. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) yesterday, 6 September 2016, said its non-manufacturing purchasing manager index (PMI) index fell to six-year low of 51.4 in August from 55.5 in July. FMCG stocks rose. Godrej Consumer Products (up 3.21%), Colgate-Palmolive (India) (up 1.47%), Britannia Industries (up 0.98%), GlaxoSmithkline Consumer Healthcare (up 0.39%), Marico (up 0.07%), Tata Global Beverages (up 0.88%), Jyothy Laboratories (up 0.93%), Bajaj Corp (up 0.86%) rose. Hindustan Unilever (down 0.72%), Dabur India (down 0.7%), Nestle India (down 0.96%), Procter & Gamble Hygiene and Health Care (down 0.66%) fell. Bharat Heavy Electricals (Bhel) surged on high volume after the company reported strong Q1 result during market hours today, 7 September 2016. The stock jumped 13.52% to Rs 157.05. Bhel's net profit surged 54.21% to Rs 77.77 crore on 20.84% growth in total income to Rs 5871.78 crore in Q1 June 2016 over Q1 June 2015. On BSE, so far 60.79 lakh shares were traded in the counter as against average daily volume of 8.03 lakh shares in the past one quarter. Bhel's order backlog stood at Rs 1.08 lakh crore as on 30 June 2016. Seperately, Bhel said that India Ratings and Research has downgraded its Long-Term Issuer rating to 'IND AA+' from 'IND AAA'. The announcement was made during trading hours today, 7 September 2016. Bhel said that India Ratings and Research has, simultaneously, removed all ratings from Rating Watch Negative (RWN) and a Negative Outlook has been assigned to all Long-term ratings. The removal of RWN follows the completion of the ongoing evaluation of Bhel's key business parameters. According to statement issued by India Ratings and Research, decline in Bhel's revenue for the period from FY 2013 to FY 2016, slow moving projects in the company's order book, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margins turning negative and high debtors days led to downgrade of the company's ratings.

Find out how addiction and substance abuse impact your community Health FDA bans soaps claiming to contain antibacterial properties Selima Hussain Washing your hands with soap and water is one of the best ways to stop the spread of germs. Privacy Policy You may want to think twice before buying soap that claims to kill 99.9 percent of bacteria. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration Friday banned soaps with certain “antibacterial” or “antimicrobial” properties, saying there is not enough proof to show the claims are actually true. The organization also barred companies from marketing soaps containing one or more of 19 active ingredients – most commonly, triclosan and triclocarbon. “Consumers may think antibacterial washes are more effective at preventing the spread of germs, but we have no scientific evidence that they are any better than plain soap and water,” Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. The FDA first proposed a rule back in 2013, after finding that long-term exposure to active ingredients in antibacterial soaps could lead to health problems such as bacterial resistance and hormonal issues. The agency prompted manufacturers to send data and clinical studies proving these antibacterial washes were significantly better than non-antibacterial washes in terms of reducing infection. In the three years following, the FDA received either no evidence or insufficient evidence to back up the health claims. Now, manufacturers will have one year to remove products marketed with these active ingredients. Some companies, like Proctor & Gamble, have already started removing the chemicals from soap products. The FDA’s rule doesn’t apply to hand sanitizer or wipes. When soap isn’t available, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend using sanitizer containing at least 60 percent alcohol to stop the spread of germs.   Sticking with good, old-fashioned soap and water, however, is one of the FDA’s main recommendations.    “Washing with plain soap and running water remains one of the most important steps consumers can take to avoid getting sick and to prevent spreading germs to others,” the statement said.

As Indonesia seeks ways to grow its economy, product exports are one way to build cash reserves, create jobs and lift more of its 250 million citizens out of poverty. But environmental groups say industries such as pulp, rubber and palm oil cause a bevy of challenges, from human rights abuses to environmental degradation. The result could be irreversible damage from deforestation that also threatens Indonesia’s most profitable sectors. Widespread fires, often lit to dry peatlands, are exacerbating this problem. It is easy for companies to say no to deforestation – the implementation of such plans, however, has often proven to become a difficult task. Greenpeace, one of the NGOs that says it is aggressively tackling this crisis, worked with other stakeholders to come up with a long-term solution to Indonesia’s growing deforestation problem. The environmental activist group worked with other nonprofits, consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies and Indonesia’s largest commodity producers to develop the High Carbon Stock Approach (HCS). The HCS Approach is a methodology incorporating a wide array of scientific data to identify the world’s most valuable forests. With its current focus on Indonesia, HCS Approach practitioners can identify forests that are highly valuable and therefore should be designated for protection. On the other hand, areas that may have degraded over time — and demonstrate low carbon or biodiversity values — can be primed for development in order to harvest commodity crops. The result is a tool for companies that are keen to enact change in their supply chains, but struggle to identify lands and companies with ties to deforestation. Companies can access HCS data to make sure they aren’t using raw materials, such as palm oil, that come from dubious sources. And despite its name, the HCS Approach is not just about carbon. HCS data can also give an idea about a forest’s biodiversity and vegetation density, as well as land-source planning and land rights tied to these regions. Companies that struggle with human rights abuses within their supply chains, for example, can tap into this data to ensure land use occurs within free, prior and informed consent protocols (FPIC) that grant local communities the right to vet companies and grant access to their ancestral lands. Supporters of the HCS Approach include companies against which Greenpeace has long campaigned. And they say the methodology is scientifically credible, transparent, and can halt species loss and land rights abuses. CPG companies involved with the HCS Approach include P&G and Unilever. They are joined by palm oil producers Wilmar, Musim Mas and Agropalma. Asia Pulp and Paper (APP) is one large Indonesian company that worked to develop the HCS Approach, along with Greenpeace, the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Rainforest Alliance. For APP, which is responsible for a supply chain that covers 2.6 million hectares (10,000 square miles), much of its involvement with the HCS Approach is about developing a legal framework. The company has held some of its concessions for nearly 30 years, but land rights cases can arise at any time, leaving the company and its suppliers scrambling to find solutions. HCS data offers a tool by which companies like APP can compromise with local communities while preventing wayward suppliers and contractors from harvesting forests illegally. This data can also help provide local governments, which usually lack the resources to enforce laws, with the information they need to prevent illegal logging and tree-felling. The threats to Indonesia’s forests are still daunting, but the HCS Approach is an example of how technology and “big data” can help solve this problem and allow stakeholders to work together. Aida Greenbury, managing director of Sustainability at APP, is cautiously optimistic, as she explained to an audience at this week’s IUCN Congress in Honolulu. “It might be a long shot,” she said, “but those of us in the private sector can use these resources we now have at hand to work with governments to protect these forests.” Image credit: Leon Kaye Disclosure: Asia Pulp and Paper (APP) is funding Leon Kaye’s trip to Hawaii to cover the IUCN Congress.

Sport Other Sports Rio Paralympics 2016: Captaining Team GB will be pinnacle after a punch ended my Premier dream, says Jack Rutter Matt Watts Wednesday 7 September 2016 09:29 BST Battling back: Jack Rutter kickstarting the P&G Sainsbury's campaign to raise money for the British Paralympic Association Paralympic footballer Jack Rutter today said captaining Team GB's Cerebral Palsy side would be the pinnacle of a seven-year battle back to the top of the game after an assault wrecked his dreams of becoming a professional. The 25-year-old said leading the seven-a-side team out in the opener against Brazil at the Paralympic Games in Rio would be the proudest moment of his career.  In 2009 Rutter, then 18, was punched during a night out in Gloucester in an unprovoked attack which left him with brain damage and deaf in one ear.  It happened a month before he was due to be given a professional contract by then Premier League club Birmingham City, wrecking his future. The midfielder said he then went through the "darkest times" of his life as he dropped to the bottom tiers of non-league football as his injuries stopped him being the player he once was. But Rutter said he was inspired after being offered a route back through Cerebral Palsy football.  Having seen the Team GB side play at London 2012 he was called by the head of disability football at the FA, Jeff Davies, who told him he had heard his story and he could have a trial. Rutter became England captain and played at the world championships but the Paralympic Games were his ultimate focus.  He told the Standard: "Captaining the team at the Paralympics will easily be the proudest moment of my career. "I feel like the adversity and pain I suffered during those dark times is the strength I feel now.  To go out and captain Great Britain in the first game, the opening game against Brazil, will put all that bad stuff to bed and that for me will be the best feeling in the world." Rutter, who plays for Lydney Town in the ninth tier of English football, said he hoped his story would be an inspiration to others who face adversity.  He spoke as he kick-started a campaign which will see donations from P&G products sold at Sainsbury's help raise money for the British Paralympic Association.  One P&G product will equal one donation until September 20.

Sport Other Sports Rio Paralympics 2016: Anne Dickins: I beat seasickness to become a paracanoeist Athlete tells of therapy journey to prepare for contest in Rio  Matt Watts Wednesday 7 September 2016 09:21 BST Contender: Paralympics GB athlete Anne Dickins Paracanoeist Anne Dickins today told of her journey from a lifelong avoidance of boats due to severe seasickness to going for gold in Rio. The 47-year-old former endurance cyclist will be favourite for the KL3 200m race in Brazil in the culmination of an incredible journey after injury ended her career on a bike. During a break in a 24-hour race in 2011, the athlete laid down with her pump and multi-tool still in her back pocket. She ruptured a disc in her back and injured nerves in her leg which left her disabled and forced her to give up cycling. A chance meeting with a GB paracanoe coach while volunteering at London 2012 saw her invited to try out for the sport. Since then she has won both European and world titles. But one of her main fears about finding a new career in a canoe was her severe seasickness which saw her avoid boats her whole life. She told the Standard she had a desensitisation programme normally saved for fighter pilots to cure motion sickness: "I had lots of specialists, lots of investigations, lots of treatments. Before I started this journey to Rio I'd never been in a canoe. But this was all part of the challenge I wanted." She said of becoming a Paralympic athlete: "If I can inspire someone to take up a sport, that's what it's all about." Ms Dickins spoke as she took part in a campaign which sees donations from P&G products sold at Sainsbury's to help fund British Paralympic Association athletes. One product = one donation, until September 20. See stores for details.
