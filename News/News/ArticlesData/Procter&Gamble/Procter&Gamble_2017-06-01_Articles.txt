Данное решение было зафиксировано в соглашении, подписанном 1 июня, в рамках Петербургского международного экономического форума (ПМЭФ-2017) между компанией и губернатором региона Алексеем Дюминым. Об этом говорится в пресс-релизе, поступившем в редакцию «Ленты.ру». В сообщении отмечается, что инвестиции пойдут на модернизацию и увеличение объемов российского производства продукции P&G в Новомосковске, создание новых рабочих мест и расширение сотрудничества с местными поставщиками. В рамках модернизации завода компания вложит средства в развитие новых экологически чистых технологий, применение которых позволит сделать производство полностью безотходным в течение двух лет. Как отмечают в компании, с 2010 года завод в Новомосковске сократил потребление электроэнергии и воды, а также выбросы в атмосферу на 20 процентов. Кроме того, на производстве завод использует около 80 процентов вторичной бумаги для производства упаковки для стиральных порошков. Реализация объявленной инвестиционной программы рассчитана на ближайшие два года для наращивания локализации производства в трех крупнейших категориях: средства по уходу за домом, средства по уходу за тканями и средства по уходу за детьми. В 2016 году P&G инвестировала один миллиард рублей в развитие производственного центра бренда Gillette в Санкт-Петербурге.

Go to Search More news Stimulating demand in the Russian consumer market Business & Economy ► SPIEF-2017 June 02, 6:14 UTC+3 Share 1 pages in this article KEY CONCLUSIONS: Market players expect recovery of demand after a long decline “Consumer spending in Russia is still not back to the level it was in 2014, however, there is some expectation that it might be some increase now in 2017, maybe a 1–2% increase in consumer spending mostly from a little higher oil price, increase in agriculture and also more trade with China,” said Pal Erik Sjatil, Managing Partner for EEMA, McKinsey & Company.  “The retail market has passed a certain period <...> of purification, and it appears that banks updated their product portfolios and resumed consumer lending,” said Ruben Aganbegyan, Chairman of the Supervisory Board, Bank Otkritie Financial Corporation; Member of the Board of Directors, Otkritie Holding. “I am a little bit more optimistic. <...> The economy is improving. <...> The stable exchange rate is helping in achieving [this]. <...> [People] are adjusting to the new reality,” said Silviu Popovich, President, PepsiCo Russia, Ukraine and CIS. Russia’s consumers are becoming more demanding “A class of professional consumers, or “prosumers”, is emerging in Russia. <...> Consumers really want to be informed and educated, want to know what they wear, what they eat, what they buy for their children <...> Only 11% of consumers are ready to sacrifice <...> quality, according to the Russian Public Opinion Research Centre (VCIOM),” said Maxim Protasov, Head, Russian Quality System. “The consumer behaviour has changed. Even today, on my products, 75% of consumers are looking at their mobile phone when they’re purchasing a detergent or a diaper,” said Sotirios Marinidis, Vice President Eastern Europe and Central Asia, P&G. “Buyers have become more price-sensitive,” Vladimir Chirakhov, General Director, Detsky Mir Group. CHALLENGES: Business is facing stronger competition with ever-shrinking profits "Margins of the players have been more squeezed mostly due to devaluation, which has led to the increase in the cost of goods sold," said Pal Erik Sjatil. "Competition within the industry has grown significantly stronger. This is certainly due to the lower purchasing power, and we all see what a dramatic impact it has on the market,' said Igor Shekhterman. "Unfortunately, we do not see many positive trends in the segment of goods for children. As a matter of fact, the market growth is close to zero," said Vladimir Chirakhov. "Many players have demonstrated either feeble or negative year-on-year growth", said Igor Shekhterman, CEO, Х5 Retail Group N.V. SOLUTIONS: Focus on innovation, new technologies and diversification "The increase in e-payments is an important trade driver in its own right. <...> Convenience of payments and transactions greatly boosts the demand. <...> Convenience, innovation and changes in the consumer behaviour are currently the key drivers in the payments industry, which also contribute to the overall demand growth," said Ekaterina Petelina, General Director, Visa Payment System LLC. "If people find it easier to shop in the proximity stores, they will do it more often and readily <...> We need to develop different retail formats <...> and encourage the consumers to spend their money by creating accessible infrastructure," said Viktor Evtukhov, State Secretary, Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation. Improvements in management quality, lower costs and investments in infrastructure "Import substitution gave us a fresh start and led to lower prices, including for meat and dairy products. Further growth is still an option, <...> if we start investing in logistics infrastructure," said Igor Shekhterman. "We tend to focus more on promotions and use aggressive pricing. <...> At the end of the day, that will result in lower margins <...>, hence, the management primarily focuses on the internal corporate processes trying to find a way to rebuild the company," said Vladimir Chirakhov.   {{item.group_date}} {{item.suffix?", "+item.suffix:""}} Show more Share Top News June 02, 9:17 Russian PM signs decree on lifting some restrictions on Turkish food supplies June 02, 9:17 June 02, 8:04 World leaders condemn Trump’s decision to withdraw from Paris climate accord June 02, 8:04 June 01, 18:52 Putin describes Trump as a straightforward and frank man June 01, 18:52 June 01, 18:03 Russia fears Syria's dismemberment — Putin June 01, 18:03 In other media Реклама Photo 12 The 2017 World Car of the Year and its rivals at the New York Auto Show 15 How Russians conquered the Arctic in vintage photos 13 Futuristic supercars at the Geneva Motor Show Infographics Russia's gas pipelines to Europe by 2018 Gas agreement signed by Russia, Ukraine and the EU Altai gas pipeline Economical sanctions against Russia Most read Now Today This week 1 US sends B-52 bombers, 800 pilots to NATO drills near Russian borders — media 2 Russia's Gazprom Neft discusses new projects in Iraqi Kurdistan territory 3 Putin describes Trump as a straightforward and frank man 4 Best warships and submarines of Russia's Northern fleet 5 Russian PM signs decree on lifting some restrictions on Turkish food supplies 6 World leaders condemn Trump’s decision to withdraw from Paris climate accord 7 Partners in Nord Stream 2 to profit from interest payments on lending — Wintershall’s CEO 1 Russia fears Syria's dismemberment — Putin 2 Putin describes Trump as a straightforward and frank man 3 Putin says Russia has to respond to other countries’ military potential buildup 4 Putin emphasizes that Sweden's entry to NATO would jeopardize ties with Moscow 5 Russian Aerospace Force eliminates 80 militants trying to move to Palmyra from Raqqa 6 Russia ready to supply advanced S-400 air defense missile systems to Turkey 7 New MC-21 jet: Russia’s first step on aircraft market 1 Moscow concerned over US threats against Syria’s armed forces 2 Russia’s cutting-edge fighter jet to enter service this year 3 Russian cruise missiles hit terrorist targets near Palmyra 4 Moscow mayor says Monday's hurricane 'unprecedented' 5 MC-21 airliner makes first test flight — source 6 Russian anti-submarine destroyer enters English Channel 7 Lavrov slams Macron's 'media propaganda' remarks as post-Obama policy aftereffect TOP STORIES CONFLICT IN SYRIA RUSSIA'S DEFENSE INDUSTRY OIL& GAS INDUSTRY SPACE PROGRAMS Реклама News Russian Politics & Diplomacy World Business & Economy Military & Defense Science & Space Society & Culture Sport Press Review Sections Tags Media Press Releases Infographics About us TASS TODAY AGENCY NEWS TASS HISTORY MANAGEMENT CONTACTS Services TASS-PHOTO TASS-ONLINE TASS Beta-version.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Research Report and Overview on BRICS Disposable Hygiene Products Market 2016-2026 by FMI Global Study Valley Cottage, NY — (SBWIRE) — 06/01/2017 — The disposable hygiene products market is witnessing an annual growth of nearly 6-7% due to increased consumer spending on personal care products globally. In addition, the demand for improvised comfort, performance and efficient absorbent hygiene products is expected to drive demand for disposable hygiene products in the near future. Concerns for safety, convenience and hygiene are identified as key factors affecting growth of disposable hygiene products market. Furthermore, rising consumption of products such as sanitary pads, wipes, baby products and others across the globe is anticipated to drive demand for disposable hygiene products market in near future. Among the developing economies, increasing population and manufacture of such products in countries such as India and China and low penetration of these products is expected to open opportunities for growth of the market in BRICS. Moreover, industry-sophistication is expected to fuel the demand for disposable hygiene products in Brazil. Apart from increasing population in BRICS, economic development particularly in countries such as China and India is a key factor contributing towards substantial growth of disposable hygiene products market in the region. Furthermore, increasing disposable income, rising expenditure or consumer spending on personal hygiene and increasing hygiene concerns are expected to fuel demand for disposable hygiene products over the next five to six years. Also, increasing Internet penetration is a prime factor supporting wide distribution of these products to tech-savvy consumers in BRICS via the medium of online retailing. Internet penetration is expected to enhance distribution of these products, leading to increased consumption and brand visibility among consumers in BRICS. Request Report Sample@ http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-br-107 Although hygiene concerns rank high among consumers in the BRICS region, low awareness among people in rural areas coupled with low adoption of products in regular operations could hamper growth of the market. However, some international companies are focused on advertising campaigns along with the government awareness campaigns regarding hygiene. Although hygiene concerns in BRICS region is high, low awareness among people in rural areas coupled with low adoption of products on a regular basis is expected to restrict market growth. Moreover, cost reduction coupled with efficient packaging of the disposable hygiene products is concern for companies operating in this market. As a result, a few international companies are focusing on advertising campaigns along with product portfolio expansion through opening of new manufacturing units. For instance, Unicharm Corporation, Procter & Gamble India and Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget SCA (publ.) among others, have opened new manufacturing units for hygiene products in India. For instance, Unicharm Corporation invested US $ 39.2 million to set up a manufacturing facility with the objective to develop baby care, pet care and feminine care products in India. The disposable hygiene products market is segmented on the basis of product type and material used in products. The various disposable hygiene products include nappies, diapers, toilet paper, wipes, sanitary protection, kitchen towels, paper tableware, cotton pads and buds. These products are classified according to age-group since product usage differs accordingly. On the basis of age-group, the market has been segmented into adult care, feminine care and baby care. The materials used in these products are broadly classified as woven or non-woven, which depends on the acceptability of the product as well as age-group for which they are designed. Among all the product categories, the sanitary pads and baby products are collectively expected to be a promising area in the BRICS disposable hygiene products market. Among all the BRICS countries, India and China are expected to witness an increase in demand for disposable hygiene products, followed by Brazil and Russia. Request For TOC@ http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/toc/rep-br-107 Investments by local players for disposable hygiene products are increasing rapidly, which is expected to lead towards a strong competitive database. This in turn is predicted to enhance the competitiveness among local as well as international players, leading to substantial investments in this market in future. Prominent players in this market include Dispowear Sterite Company, Kimberley Clark Corporation, Disposable Hygiene Products Ltd., BOSTIK SA, BAHP, UNICHARM Corporation, Procter & Gamble Company, Unicharm Corporation, Kao Corporation and Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget SCA (publ).

About Future Resources Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / CGT Reveals Finalists for 2017 CMO of the Year Award CGT Reveals Finalists for 2017 CMO of the Year Award Posted on June 1, 2017 by Benzinga Full Feed in Press Releases Leadership is an overused word, and is often misused. We like this definition. Presented at the 2017 Consumer Goods Sales & Marketing Summit, the fourth annual award honors the unique and powerful role of today’s marketing leaders in the increasingly competitive consumer goods industry. Randolph, New Jersey (PRWEB) June 01, 2017 Consumer Goods Technology (CGT) will present its fourth annual CMO of the Year award during a special ceremony on June 6th at the 2017 Consumer Goods Sales & Marketing Summit in New York City. This one of-a-kind award will be given to the Chief Marketing Officer who has made the largest demonstrable impact on his/her consumer goods organization through the implementation and successful use of new marketing strategies, technologies and/or processes. The nominations have been open since January 2017, submitted by members of the consumer goods community. Narrowing the nominations down to four deserving individuals, CGT has presented them to its esteemed Editorial and Research Advisory Boards for voting. Here are this year's finalists for CMO of the Year: David Kroll, MillerCoors David Kroll is responsible for leading the company’s efforts in brand marketing, innovation, insights, media, and sports and event marketing. Previously, Kroll was vice president of innovation for MillerCoors. Prior to joining MillerCoors in 2012, Kroll spent more than 20 years in marketing and operations, driving profitable growth for some of the world's most recognized brands, which included a range of leadership positions with Dyson, Alberto Culver (Unilever), Wrigley, P&G and Cargill. He initiated a global media review that concluded in early 2017 already bringing a greater focus and consistency to the marketing plan. His team took on responsibility for the Blue Moon and Leinenkugel brands last fall. Unique recent efforts have included a tie-in with Uber that offered Chicago Cubs and White Sox fans free rides home from the teams' 2017 season openers. Peter McGuinness, Chobani McGuinness was a "CMO of the Year" finalist last year, but what makes him worth additional recognition is what happened in 2016: Chobani stopped being simply "America’s No. 1-selling Greek Yogurt brand" and became "America's No. 2-selling yogurt brand," having completed an impressive 9-year rise to the top of the category. As Chief Marketing & Brand Officer since 2013, McGuinness has helped build a truly authentic brand that resonates deeply with younger, more socially conscious consumers. A recently launched "Believe in Food" branding campaign promotes the community values that are a core component of the brand's (and company's) positioning. Social channels (not to mention social issues) and other non-traditional media were critical to Chobani's early development and are still a key component of the strategy. Chobani recently was recognized by Fast Company as one of the top 10 most innovative companies in the world and was recently featured on 60 Minutes. Marie Gulin-Merle, L’Oréal USA Marie Gulin-Merle was named Chief Marketing Officer for L’Oréal USA in June 2014. Her team almost immediately began working with General Assembly to create a "GMAT for Digital" training program to get L’Oréal’s marketers up to speed on best practices for data, search engine optimization, mobile marketing, social media and content creation. In ranking her as the 13th "Most Innovative CMO" last December, Business Insider said Gulin-Merle has turned L’Oréal USA into a "digital powerhouse" through a "first-adopter approach to new platforms and ad formats." Efforts have included a Snapchat campaign for Maybelline during New York Fashion Week, becoming the first beauty advertiser on Pinterest, and creating a virtual reality hairstylist education program for its Matrix brand. This summer, the company will launch a bot on Facebook Messenger with Kiehls. Keith Weed, Unilever Weed has served as Chief Marketing and Communications Officer since 2010. He created and leads the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan to proactively pioneer ways of integrating sustainability into the business. Weed takes an informed, pragmatic approach to media planning that focuses on "connecting with people where they're spending their time," and he stresses that "the biggest thing that drives engagement is the quality of the creative," not the marketing vehicle. While a strong proponent of new technologies, he takes a more strategic view on activation ("If it's 85% optimized for mobile [but] 110% optimized for my brand, that's great.") Recent activity has included an AI-driven "Chef Wendy" text-messaging service for Knorr, a Beacon-based in-store program run through foodie and shopper apps such as Epicurious and CheckPoints Maille, and a Smartlabel app to provide product transparency. CGT presents several awards through the year to the members of the consumer goods community.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Diapers Market – Indian Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast 2017 – 2021 Diapers are broadly categorized into two types i.e. disposable diapers and cloth diapers. Disposable diapers constitute the largest market PUNE, INDIA, June 1, 2017 /EINPresswire.com/ — India Diapers Market In India, of late, hygiene industry is experiencing an unprecedented growth as hygiene products are being adopted into the lifestyle of the masses. With the increased awareness and increasing purchasing power, customers are fast shifting from cloth nappies to baby diapers. Consumers today are looking for baby diapering solutions that go beyond the basic benefits of dryness and go the extra mile to incorporate value-adding features such as softness and caring for their baby’s delicate skin. Indians give birth to around 27 million babies each year, yet the penetration rate of baby diapers remains at less than two percent. Request a sample report @ https://www.wiseguyreports.com/sample-request/744750-india-diapers-market-outlook-2021 According to “India Diaper Market Outlook, 2021”, India’s diaper market was growing with a CAGR of 22.23% over past five years. In 2014, the market for baby diapers in urban India grew with a CAGR of 19.99% whereas in rural India the growth was much higher than urban. On the basis of age, the report categorizes the India diaper market into baby diapers and adult diapers. Baby diapers constitute the leading category in the market. During the forecast horizon, adult diapers market is expected to grow significantly due to the increasing healthcare standards in the country. However, social and economic constraints of using adult diapers are hampering the market growth. P&G’s Pampers dominates the overall diaper industry, followed by Huggies and Mamy Poko. P&G’s lack of innovation and focus on higher margins amid aggressive strategies adopted by its competitors to increase their market share is expected to decrease brand’s market share in future. Japanese firm Unicharm, which sells Mamy Poko diapers, overtook Kimberly Clark in baby diaper segment nearly two years ago. In baby diaper segment, Pampers, Mamy Poko and Huggies constitute more than 85% of the market by value whereas in adult diaper segment, Nobel Hygiene and Actifit dominate the industry heavily. Diapers are broadly categorized into two types i.e. disposable diapers and cloth diapers. Disposable diapers constitute the largest market share and are seeing increasing investments by manufacturers in their research and development. In the last few years modern cloth diapers have become a fast moving trend worldwide for families looking for a natural modern way to diaper their babies. Sales of cloth diapers were 140 lakh units in 2014 and are expected to climb up in the forecast period, owing to environmental benefits. Other type of diapers includes swim pants and training pants which has a marginal market share in India.

'Customer Satisfaction' Says It All Ask Dr. Gary S. Goodman, President of Customersatisfaction.com, Where The Value Is In His URL, and Peter F. Drucker Will Tell You!     cnbcfreqflyr   Spread the Word Listed Under Tags: * Keynote Speaker * Customer Satisfaction * Surveys Industry: * Business Location: * Los Angeles - California - USLOS ANGELES - June 1, 2017 - PRLog -- Ask Dr. Gary S. Goodman, President of Customersatisfaction.com, where the value is in his URL, and you'll hear some interesting answers. "Well, for one thing it is really a kingmaker," he says. Pointing to his frequent expert appearances on CNBC and in the media, and to his many book contracts and speaking engagements, he says "Customersatisfaction.com has positioned me quite nicely as a spokesperson and thought leader." He adds: "If you are simply Mary Smith with The Smith Agency, you may have a lot to say and should be listened to. But you're not as likely to be interviewed, quoted, and taken seriously as I am," Goodman points out. "When I call the President of a company such as JD Power and announce I am President of Customersatisfaction.com, instantly, there's respect. I'm a peer, and that's invaluable," Goodman claims. Goodman has owned the URL for about 15 years, but he says he hasn't exploited its true value. "Speaking of JD Power, it is a wonderful brand, hard-won through generations. But what business are they really in? They're in the customer satisfaction measurement business, and their URLs should emphasize this." Likewise, Goodman says any brand that stands behind its brand, whether it's a FedEx, Proctor & Gamble, Apple, or Adobe, should assert its "special commitment to customer satisfaction" through such a URL. Goodman freely credits this view to his teacher and colleague, famed management guru Peter F. Drucker. "Drucker was fond of challenging CEOs with the question, 'What business are you REALLY in?' " "If you get to the bedrock truth, all businesses are in the customer satisfaction business," Goodman says with zeal. Goodman echoes what Drucker said: "The entire purpose of a business is to create and satisfy a customer." What about other URLs that tout customer "care" or customer "experience" or even customer "service." Are those worth investing in? "Not so much," says Goodman. "These are emphasizing process and not results. People don't care about what you're doing, the so-called quality you're putting in; they care about the outcomes, the quality they're getting from it." "Signaling your commitment to achieve customer satisfaction through your URL "Is simply smart business," Goodman says. Is he interested in selling? "Like any great asset, it is always seeking a higher and better use" he smiles. Dr. Gary S. Goodman is the best-selling author of some 20 books and audiobooks including Monitoring, Measuring & Managing Customer Service, Please Don't Shoot The Messenger, Reach Out & Sell Someone, and Selling Skills For The Non-Salesperson. He teaches at UCLA and U.C. Berkeley, and his consulting client list is vast, containing many of the best and brightest companies in the world.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print The lobbyists who got White House ethics waivers By Theodoric Meyer 06/01/2017 02:09 PM EDT With David Beavers, Daniel Lippman and Aubree Eliza Weaver. FOUR FORMER LOBBYISTS GOT ETHICS WAIVERS FOR WHITE HOUSE WORK: The White House disclosed the ethics waivers it has issued last night, including waivers exempting four former lobbyists now working in the administration from President Donald Trump’s executive order preventing them from working on issues they had recently lobbied on. One is “Trump energy policy adviser Michael Catanzaro, a former lobbyist for the oil and gas industry,” POLITICO’s Josh Gerstein reports. “He was given approval to work on ‘energy and environmental policy issues’ including the Clean Power Plan, the Waters of the United States rule and other environmental regulations.” Story Continued Below — “Tax policy adviser Shahira Knight, a former Fidelity executive, was approved to deal with tax, retirement and financial services issues even though she'd previously lobbied on those topics. ‘The National Economic Council has been tasked with addressing issues relating to tax, retirement and financial services. The Administration has an interest in you working on matters in those areas due to your expertise and prior experience,’ the waiver reads.” — “White House economic aide Andrew Olmem was cleared to work on a variety of finance-related issues despite his lobbying for several big insurance companies and banks” as a lobbyist for Venable. “Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff, Joshua Pitcock, also got a waiver. He'd worked as a lobbyist for the state of Indiana on various issues, but was given approval to deal with Indiana state officials in his current job and to work on issues he'd lobbied on for the state, including refugee policy, opioid abuse, trade and education policy and wide variety of other areas.” The waivers are only for those staffers working in the White House; waivers issued for staffers in executive branch agencies have yet to be disclosed. Full story. BALLARD PARTNERS ADDS A PARTNER: “Ballard Partners has hired Rebecca Benn as a partner at the firm’s office in Washington,” POLITICO Florida’s Christine Sexton reports. The firm, led by Brian Ballard, a top fundraising lieutenant to Trump during the campaign, opened a Washington office after Trump won and has signed more than two dozen federal clients this year. “Benn was most recently the director of federal affairs for CSX Transportation, where she was responsible for all government relations initiatives impacting automation, safety, environmental regulation and security. She had previously served as a staffer on the Appropriations Committee for the U.S. Senate.” Full story. FORMER JOLLY STAFFER JOINS MERCURY: J.D. White, the former chief of staff to former Rep. David Jolly (R-Fla.), is joining Mercury’s Florida team, POLITICO Florida’s Matt Dixon reports. “Mercury's Florida operation is comprised of the state's top strategists across party lines,” Ashley Walker, a Mercury partner, said in a statement. “JD's public policy expertise, as well as his political experience will be an asset to our work here in Florida and globally." Jolly lost to Democrat Charlie Crist last year. Full story. Good afternoon, and welcome to PI. Switching jobs? Sign a new client? Get in touch: tmeyer@politico.com.

PARIS PRESSURE: Some of the most prominent companies in the country are trying to pressure Trump into remaining in the Paris climate change agreement as he is reportedly preparing to pull out of it. More than two dozen firms — including Apple, Facebook, Google, Intel, Microsoft and Morgan Stanley — put their names on an open letter to Trump that ran this morning as a full-page ad in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. Elon Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX chief executive, threatened to stop advising Trump if he quit the climate pact. And Apple CEO Tim Cook and Musk both called the White House on Wednesday to try to press Trump to change his mind, according to The Wall Street Journal. — But it’s unclear how aggressively the companies that have signed onto open letters (a previous one that ran in newspapers last month included signatures from the chief executives of Bank of America, Disney, General Electric, Goldman Sachs and Procter & Gamble, among others) have been pushing the administration behind the scenes. National Grid, which signed one of the letters, urged the White House to remain in the deal in private meetings with administration officials, according to a spokeswoman. But Levi Strauss & Co., which also signed, hasn’t done so. The company “felt we contributed more by adding to the public groundswell of business support for U.S. leadership in the Paris Climate Agreement than we did with private calls,” Andrea Hicklin, a Levi’s spokeswoman, wrote in an email. ELSEWHERE IN CORPORATE ACTIVISM: FWD.us, the immigration policy advocacy group led started by Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, is partnering with Verizon, Airbnb, Snapchat, Square and other companies to celebrate June as Immigrant Heritage Month, along with a number of Democratic and Republican governors and other officials. THE URBAN PROFILE: “After masterminding President Donald Trump’s crucial 2016 election victory in Pennsylvania, [Dave Urban] has quickly emerged as one of Washington’s most influential lobbyists,” Bloomberg News’ Ben Brody reports. “Urban’s firm, American Continental Group, has already registered 18 new clients this year — six times as many as a year ago — bringing in at least $550,000 in the first three months of 2017.” — “Urban, 53, would seem to fit squarely into what Trump has derided as Washington’s ‘swamp,’ a place where lobbyists earn six- or seven-figure incomes by cajoling former government colleagues on behalf of big business. Yet his name has also surfaced as a possible addition to the White House personnel roster if Trump decides to shake up staffing. … Urban has an ‘unparalleled network of people,’ said Bill Morley, the chief executive officer of the Altrius Group who counts Pfizer Inc. among his lobbying clients. ‘He’s got those relationships all around town.’” Full story. QUOTE OF THE DAY: “Thinking of canceling my alarm service,” Tony Podesta wrote in an email to The New York Times’ Katie Rogers for a story on Barack and Michelle Obama buying the Kalorama home they’d been renting. Podesta lives two doors down from the Obamas. TRUMP ISN’T CAUSING A LOBBYING BOOM (AT LEAST NOT YET): “With a unified Republican government in Washington, lobbyists hoped that 2017 would offer a long-awaited opportunity to push big proposals through Congress — but records do not indicate any large uptick in clients during the early months of the Trump administration,” Roll Call’s Sean McMinn and Kate Ackley report. “Unlike the beginning of Barack Obama’s presidency, lobbying registrations made available by the secretary of the Senate show almost no change from previous years in the number of clients lobbyists started working with early this year. … Lobbyists took on 3,433 clients in 2009 in the months after Obama won his first presidential election — more than double the amount after President Donald Trump won.” Full story. HERALD GROUP ADDS FOUR: The Herald Group is adding four to its public affairs team. Krista Cupp and Sabrina Schaeffer are joining as vice presidents, Maggie Sherouse will be a director and Liam Sullivan will be a senior associate. Cupp previously worked for the National Rifle Association’s Institute for Legislative Action. Schaeffer was previously the executive director of the Independent Women’s Forum. Sherouse previously worked for Edelman and Sullivan comes from Sage Communications. NEW DETAILS ON PRICE’S POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: Then-Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) pressed Australian officials during a trip to the country last year for a provision that would help American pharmaceutical firms if the Trans-Pacific Partnership became a reality, three weeks after buying up to $90,000 in pharmaceutical stocks, ProPublica’s Robert Faturechi reports. “Price’s lobbying abroad, which has not previously been reported, is another example of how his work in Congress could have benefitted his investment portfolio. He traded hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of shares in health-related companies while taking action on legislation and regulations affecting the industry.” Full story. CHECK IT OUT: POLITICO Europe has launched a new U.K. Election Tracker app for iPhones. JOBS REPORT: — The Property Casualty Insurance Association of America has added Mona Dooley and Kyle Glenn as assistant vice presidents for federal government relations and Margaret Labno as vice president for tax and accounting policy. Dooley was previously a senior legislative assistant to Rep. Pete King (R-N.Y.). Glenn was previously deputy chief of staff to Rep. Dennis Ross (R-Fla.). Labno was previously assistant vice president for tax at Zurich North America. — Red Banyan has added Kenny Ames as director of client relations. He was previously director of business development for Fireside21. — Former Vice President Joe Biden “has hired Greg Schultz, his political director during his second term as vice president, as the executive director of” his new PAC, American Possibilities, POLITICO’s Edward-Isaac Dovere reports. Biden is biding (sorry) his time as he considers a 2020 presidential run. — The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights is adding three staffers as Vanita Gupta starts her tenure as the group’s new president and chief executive. Kristine Lucius, a veteran of the Senate Judiciary Committee, will be executive vice president for policy. Seema Nanda, who was previously chief of staff to Labor Secretary Tom Perez, will be executive vice president and chief operating officer. And Ashley Allison, who previously worked for Valerie Jarrett in the White House Office of Public Engagement, will be a senior adviser. — Kathleen Kingscott, IBM Research’s vice president for strategic partnerships, has been named the new co-chairwoman of the Task Force on American Innovation, a nonpartisan coalition that supports funding for scientific research.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Surfactants Market Driven by Rising Demand for Personal Care Products, Industrial Cleaners,By 2023 Surfactants Market The global surfactants market is fragmented to a considerable degree and features several players with a significant share. Some of the leading players in the global surfactants market are BASF SE, The Dow Chemical Company, Archer Daniels Midland Company, Galaxy Surfactants Limited, Huntsman Corporation, Clariant International Ltd., Evonik Industries AG, P&G Chemicals, Lonza Group Ltd., and Akzo Nobel NV. The steady urbanization across the world is likely to ensure steady demand from several of the leading application segments of the global surfactants market, leading to the market retaining its fragmented competitive landscape in the coming years. Region-specific players could also make a significant market on the global surfactants market in the coming years, as the demand dynamics of the surfactants market are often region-specific. According to Transparency Market Research (TMR), the global surfactants market is expected to reach a valuation of US$28.8 bn by 2023. The market is likely to exhibit a steady 4.20% CAGR between 2015 and 2023. Browse Market Research Report @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/surfactants-market.html Anionic Surfactants to Retain Dominance in Global Surfactants Market The global surfactants market is bifurcated into the major segments of cationic and anionic surfactants on the basis of product type. Of these, anionic surfactants are expected to be the dominant segment in the global surfactants market in the coming years. Anionic surfactants find large-scale use in industrial detergents and cleaners, which has been a key factor in their rising demand. Nevertheless, cationic surfactants are also likely to witness steady demand over the coming years, leading to the product breakdown of the global surfactants market remaining largely unchanged over the forecast period. Non-ionic and amphoteric surfactants are likely to occupy a relatively minor position in the global surfactants market in the coming years. Geographically, the global surfactants market is segmented into Asia Pacific, North America, Latin America, Europe, and the Middle East and Africa. Of these, Asia Pacific is expected to retain its current position as the leading regional contributor to the global surfactants market in the coming years. The rising demand for surfactants from emerging countries such as India, China, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand is a key factor driving the Asia Pacific surfactants market. Fill the form for an exclusive sample of this report @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Nevertheless, The North America surfactants market is also likely to make steady progress over the coming years. The firmly established presence of several leading players in the global surfactants industry in North America is a key factor responsible for the strong growth prospects of the region’s surfactants market. Consistent demand from the industrial sector is likely to help the North America surfactants market’s growth over the forecast period. Apart from these two leaders, Latin America and the Middle East are also likely to make a considerable contribution to the global surfactants market’s growth in the coming years thanks to the rapid urbanization in several countries in these regions. Rising Demand for Personal Care Products Crucial for Global Surfactants Market The global surfactants market is driven primarily by the booming global personal care products sector. Consumers across the world are becoming increasingly conscious about their appearance as well as persona hygiene, leading to rising demand for a variety of personal care products. The demand for skin care and hair care products has also been driven by the rising pollution levels across the world, which is likely to remain a key factor indirectly linked to the global surfactants market. The rapid urbanization in developing economies has also boosted the demand for household detergents, which already hold a leading share in the surfactants market in developed regions. As a result, household detergents are likely to remain the leading application segment of the global surfactants market. On the other hand, the global surfactants market could face a significant roadblock in the form of the steady shift in regulatory frameworks. Some surfactants have been shown to have an adverse effect on human health as well as the environment, which could restrict their demand in regions with strict regulatory frameworks concerning the use of solvent-based detergents.

Matthew Frankel (TMFMathGuy) Jun 1, 2017 at 8:43AM With the stock market hovering near all-time highs, it can be a smart idea to think a little defensively in your portfolio. However, that doesn't mean you need to give up your growth potential if the market keeps rising. Blue chip dividend stocks have historically performed better than their non-dividend counterparts during tough times, and many have outperformed the overall market over long time periods. With that in mind, here are five of the largest dividend payers in the market, all of which pay out more than $5 billion per year to shareholders and could make excellent additions to your portfolio now. Company Recent Stock Price Dividend Yield Annual Dividends Paid ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) $81.55 3.8% $12.9 billion AT&T (NYSE:T) $38.12 5.1% $12.0 billion Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) $52.41 2.9% $7.6 billion Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) $87.25 3.2% $7.2 billion International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) $152.49 3.9% $5.6 billion Data source: CNBC and author's calculations. Stock prices, dividend yields, and annualized dividend rates are current as of May 29, 2017. Annual dividends paid are calculated by multiplying the current quarterly dividend rate by four, and then multiplying by the number of outstanding shares. 1. ExxonMobil Integrated oil giant ExxonMobil is one of the largest companies in the world, so it should be no surprise that it's also one of the biggest dividend payers. One major reason to like Exxon is for the diversification of its business. The company has operations in offshore and onshore oil drilling, chemicals, refining, and more. And while much of Exxon's revenue suffers when oil prices fall, some areas of the business actually tend to do better. For example, as my Foolish colleague Reuben Gregg Brewer pointed out, 2015 was a terrible year for Exxon's drilling operations, but the company's refining business more than doubled its profits. As far as the dividend goes, Exxon is a member of the Dividend Aristocrats index, having raised its dividend for 34 consecutive years, and pays 3.8% as of this writing. Considering the company's financial strength and profitability, the streak shouldn't be in jeopardy anytime soon. Image source: Getty Images. 2. AT&T Telecom giant AT&T is a favorite stock among dividend-seeking investors, and for good reason -- its 5.1% yield is among the best you'll find from such a stable company. And like Exxon, AT&T has a streak of consecutive dividend increases that exceeds three decades. There are a few good reasons to like AT&T over the long term. For one thing, AT&T has a pending acquisition of Time Warner. That will add all of the latter's content, helping AT&T to keep building a moat around its business, and allowing it to continue to bundle more and more services together -- potentially capturing market share from rivals such as Verizon and Sprint. 3. Wells Fargo Wells Fargo has significantly underperformed the rest of the banking sector over the past nine months or so, as a result of the now-infamous "fake accounts" scandal. This was certainly a major misstep by the bank, and the fallout from the scandal is obvious. The bank's non-interest income has fallen significantly, expenses are up, and the bank's normally strong efficiency ratio has suffered. Having said that, I believe that the effects of the scandal will be temporary. Wells Fargo remains one of the most well-run banks in the world, in terms of risk management, efficiency of operations, and profitability. The bank has consistently delivered better returns on equity and assets than its rivals, while maintaining a relatively low-risk asset portfolio. 4. Procter & Gamble Consumer product giant Procter & Gamble's strength lies in its vast portfolio of well-known brand names, including Gillette, Pampers, Tide, and Downy, just to name a few. To be clear, there certainly are some challenges facing Procter & Gamble going forward. For example, discounted and subscription-based razor competitors such as Dollar Shave Club have cost the Gillette brand market share in recent years. However, the long-term outlook is still strong for P&G shareholders. The company has proactively shed non-core brands to focus on its biggest winners, and has done an excellent job of controlling costs and boosting margins. Finally, Procter & Gamble has one of the longest streaks of consecutive dividend increases in the market at 60 years and counting. 5. International Business Machines It was recently disclosed that Warren Buffett had unloaded about 30% of Berkshire Hathaway's massive stake in International Business Machines, better known as IBM. Buffett said that the company was facing strong competition, and therefore he had valued its stock "somewhat downward." However, don't be too quick to abandon IBM -- Buffett still owns more than 50 million shares of the tech giant, and the central reasons Buffett bought IBM in the first place still apply. For one thing, IBM still has great relationships with large organizations, which not only provide stability to its revenue, but also give the company a strong base on which to grow with new product developments. The business also has "stickiness," meaning that it would cost its customers a lot of money to choose a new provider for the integrated solutions (hardware, software, and services) that IBM provides.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman MIT Sloan School of Management welcomes inaugural Asia School of Business class to Cambridge campus; Students meet with former governor of Malaysia’s central bank CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June 1, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ — As a part of a six-week program in the United States, the inaugural MBA class of the Asia School of Business (ASB), located in Malaysia and established in collaboration with MIT Sloan School of Management, is visiting the Sloan campus for one month where they will enroll in courses taught by the top-ranked School’s faculty. The ASB students will visit companies in the Boston area and learn about MIT’s innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem. Their arrival was marked by a visit with Dr. Zeti Akhtar Aziz, the former governor of Bank Negara Malaysia, the nation’s central bank, who is Co-Chair of the ASB Board of Governors. The ASB, which was established in 2015 through collaboration between MIT Sloan and Bank Negara Malaysia, launched its inaugural MBA program in August 2016. The students’ visit exemplifies the ASB’s practice-oriented approach to management, which is one of the hallmarks of MIT Sloan. Through semester long Action Learning projects, students apply business management theories in a broad range of real-world organizational and institutional settings.  During the first year of its 20-month long program, the ASB students embarked on a transformative journey to Malaysia, Timor-Leste, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, India, and Mexico. They have worked on action learning projects with companies such as Citibank, Prudential, MasterCard, Boeing, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, PwC, AirAsia, Morgan Stanley, Google, and Microsoft.  The entire class, accompanied by ASB faculty and staff, kicked off a six-week journey across the U.S. last month, which started with a two-week trek to explore the entrepreneurial environment in Silicon Valley, the public sector in Washington D.C. and the vibrant business scene in New York. The trek has culminated in the four weeks of intense courses at MIT Sloan, being taught by resident MIT Sloan and MIT faculty.  Charles Fine, founding President and Dean of ASB and the Chrysler LGO Professor of Management and Engineering Systems at MIT Sloan, says, „Just as MIT transformed Cambridge, Massachusetts from an industrial zone into a vibrant destination for high tech, bio tech, disruptive entrepreneurship, and world-class academia, ASB aims to do the same in the region. We simply want to turbocharge the ecosystem.” Loredana Padurean, Associate Dean at ASB, and International Faculty Fellow at MIT Sloan, adds, „Action Learning is at the core of the curriculum, and is the ASB’s differentiating factor. Our students spend, on average, four weeks each semester working on-site with different companies on live projects across South East Asia. They can immediately apply what they’ve learned into those businesses.” The ASB MBA cohort is comprised of 47 talented and unconventional students from 26 industries, six continents and 13 countries: Malaysia, the U.S., Russia, the Philippines, Mexico, Brazil, Nigeria, Cote D’Ivoire, South Africa, India, Pakistan, Australia, and Peru. Commenting on the upcoming coursework at MIT Sloan, Katherine Taylor Robinson, 24, ASB MBA ’18, from New Orleans, says: „Coming here has allowed me to reflect on how my perspective has changed because of the ASB: I’m more globally-aware and introspective than ever before. I have already started applying my learning at MIT Sloan to issues such as the refugee crisis and economic development. As part of my visit to MIT Sloan, I’ve met with former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, and Jim Womack, the father of lean manufacturing.” Crystal Cha, 27, ASB MBA ’18, from Malaysia, adds: „I am grateful to have had such an immersive learning experience at MIT Sloan. The visit was the turning point in my MBA journey. Different subjects such as corporate finance and entrepreneurship have started to click into place. I was also able to reflect on the early stages of my career, and see, clearly, how I could have approached situations from a different perspective.”  S.P. Kothari, the Gordon Y Billard Professor of Accounting and Finance at MIT Sloan, who has taught the ASB students and serves on the ASB Board of Governors, shares his enthusiasm and confidence in the quality of the ASB students. „The students excelled in their enthusiasm, communication, class participation skills, and attitude. The diversity of ethnic and geo-political backgrounds is impressive. The overall intelligence and leadership potential is among the best I have seen in my 30 years of teaching MBA students in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world,” he says. Dr. Aziz’s vision is to build a school that is Asian in focus and global in its population of students, staff, faculty, and its impact. „As Asia becomes more integrated with the rest of the world, there is increased interest for a greater understanding of Asia—the economies, the businesses and the people of the region,” she says. „The establishment of the ASB is based on our conviction that the next generation of talent needs to recognize and understand the dynamics and dimensions of this phenomenon.” The inaugural ASB student class’ arrival in Cambridge is a successful extension of the relationship between MIT Sloan and the ASB communities. These exchanges aim to increase MIT Sloan’s knowledge of ASEAN, and deepen its ties with the worldwide academic community. „We are all excited to be part of something new,” says Ponce Ernest Samaniego, 27, ASB MBA ’18, who is from the Philippines. „Together, we are building a top business school, and a legacy. We are changing Asia—one of the fastest-growing and most exciting regions in the world.” The MIT Sloan School of Management is where smart, independent leaders come together to solve problems, create new organizations, and improve the world.

governor of Malaysia's central bank Month-long visit illustrates ASB's practice-oriented approach to management and ties with MIT Sloan community News provided by MIT Sloan School of Management 01 Jun, 2017, 07:30 ET Share this article CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June 1, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- As a part of a six-week program in the United States, the inaugural MBA class of the Asia School of Business (ASB), located in Malaysia and established in collaboration with MIT Sloan School of Management, is visiting the Sloan campus for one month where they will enroll in courses taught by the top-ranked School's faculty. The ASB students will visit companies in the Boston area and learn about MIT's innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem. Their arrival was marked by a visit with Dr. Zeti Akhtar Aziz, the former governor of Bank Negara Malaysia, the nation's central bank, who is Co-Chair of the ASB Board of Governors. The ASB, which was established in 2015 through collaboration between MIT Sloan and Bank Negara Malaysia, launched its inaugural MBA program in August 2016. The students' visit exemplifies the ASB's practice-oriented approach to management, which is one of the hallmarks of MIT Sloan. Through semester long Action Learning projects, students apply business management theories in a broad range of real-world organizational and institutional settings.  During the first year of its 20-month long program, the ASB students embarked on a transformative journey to Malaysia, Timor-Leste, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, India, and Mexico. They have worked on action learning projects with companies such as Citibank, Prudential, MasterCard, Boeing, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, PwC, AirAsia, Morgan Stanley, Google, and Microsoft.  The entire class, accompanied by ASB faculty and staff, kicked off a six-week journey across the U.S. last month, which started with a two-week trek to explore the entrepreneurial environment in Silicon Valley, the public sector in Washington D.C. and the vibrant business scene in New York. The trek has culminated in the four weeks of intense courses at MIT Sloan, being taught by resident MIT Sloan and MIT faculty.  Charles Fine, founding President and Dean of ASB and the Chrysler LGO Professor of Management and Engineering Systems at MIT Sloan, says, "Just as MIT transformed Cambridge, Massachusetts from an industrial zone into a vibrant destination for high tech, bio tech, disruptive entrepreneurship, and world-class academia, ASB aims to do the same in the region. We simply want to turbocharge the ecosystem." Loredana Padurean, Associate Dean at ASB, and International Faculty Fellow at MIT Sloan, adds, "Action Learning is at the core of the curriculum, and is the ASB's differentiating factor. Our students spend, on average, four weeks each semester working on-site with different companies on live projects across South East Asia. They can immediately apply what they've learned into those businesses." The ASB MBA cohort is comprised of 47 talented and unconventional students from 26 industries, six continents and 13 countries: Malaysia, the U.S., Russia, the Philippines, Mexico, Brazil, Nigeria, Cote D'Ivoire, South Africa, India, Pakistan, Australia, and Peru. Commenting on the upcoming coursework at MIT Sloan, Katherine Taylor Robinson, 24, ASB MBA '18, from New Orleans, says: "Coming here has allowed me to reflect on how my perspective has changed because of the ASB: I'm more globally-aware and introspective than ever before. I have already started applying my learning at MIT Sloan to issues such as the refugee crisis and economic development. As part of my visit to MIT Sloan, I've met with former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, and Jim Womack, the father of lean manufacturing." Crystal Cha, 27, ASB MBA '18, from Malaysia, adds: "I am grateful to have had such an immersive learning experience at MIT Sloan. The visit was the turning point in my MBA journey. Different subjects such as corporate finance and entrepreneurship have started to click into place. I was also able to reflect on the early stages of my career, and see, clearly, how I could have approached situations from a different perspective."  S.P. Kothari, the Gordon Y Billard Professor of Accounting and Finance at MIT Sloan, who has taught the ASB students and serves on the ASB Board of Governors, shares his enthusiasm and confidence in the quality of the ASB students. "The students excelled in their enthusiasm, communication, class participation skills, and attitude. The diversity of ethnic and geo-political backgrounds is impressive. The overall intelligence and leadership potential is among the best I have seen in my 30 years of teaching MBA students in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world," he says. Dr. Aziz's vision is to build a school that is Asian in focus and global in its population of students, staff, faculty, and its impact. "As Asia becomes more integrated with the rest of the world, there is increased interest for a greater understanding of Asia—the economies, the businesses and the people of the region," she says. "The establishment of the ASB is based on our conviction that the next generation of talent needs to recognize and understand the dynamics and dimensions of this phenomenon." The inaugural ASB student class' arrival in Cambridge is a successful extension of the relationship between MIT Sloan and the ASB communities. These exchanges aim to increase MIT Sloan's knowledge of ASEAN, and deepen its ties with the worldwide academic community. "We are all excited to be part of something new," says Ponce Ernest Samaniego, 27, ASB MBA '18, who is from the Philippines. "Together, we are building a top business school, and a legacy. We are changing Asia—one of the fastest-growing and most exciting regions in the world." The MIT Sloan School of Management is where smart, independent leaders come together to solve problems, create new organizations, and improve the world. Learn more at http://mitsloan.mit.edu/.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Admap Prize Winners Announced LONDON, June 1, 2017 – (ACN Newswire) – The winners of WARC’s annual global Admap Prize 2017, an essay contest that encourages and rewards individual excellence in strategic thinking in brand communications, are revealed. Based on the topic ‚How Should TV and Social Media Be Used to Maximum Effect?’ entrants were asked to address the current re-evaluation by many brands on how traditional media and new media fit together in the marketing landscape. Colin Grimshaw, editor of Admap, organiser of the prize says: „We are delighted with the response to this year’s Admap contest, now in its sixth year. We were impressed by the volume and quality of the essays submitted based on the topic motivated by P&G’s famous declaration last year of an about-face in its marketing strategy, which has prompted many brands into re-thinking their ad budgets.” Mandy Pooler, chief marketing officer for Kantar, sponsor of the Admap Prize, comments: „It is established that multichannel campaigns are more effective than single-channel, yet how brands marry TV and social continues to be a challenge. Knowledge of exactly how people consume media and subsequently act is key to the solution.” Judged by a panel of the industry’s foremost thought leaders, seven winning authors were selected offering widely different solutions. Commenting on this year’s essays, judge Gemma Craven, SVP, Director Social & Mobile of McCann New York says: „The Admap Prize topic is one of the primary challenges facing our industry today. The essays were thought-provoking, diverse and very well researched. There were different opinions on how TV and social should work together, but the clear message was that we spend much time on short-term, knee-jerk approaches to creating buzz and much less time on building long-term success via well-structured programmes.” Winning Gold and a $5,000 prize cheque, Thomas Henry, Senior Strategist at Mother New York, USA, in his top award-winning essay titled ‚Why we’re all wasting our time’, comes down forcefully on the side of TV over social for long-term brand growth. Admap Prize judge Jason Burby, President of Americas at POSSIBLE says: „Whether you believe that TV is the core and future of all marketing, the Gold Award-winning essay tells a compelling story about marketers over-focusing on short-term wins at the expense of considering long-term brand growth. It reminds us that no matter the channel, we as marketers must be focusing on the long-term impact, and that a combination of TV and digital channels leads to improved performance and impact.” The six other winners of the Admap Prize 2017 are: Silver Award: Kyle Findlay of Kantar Innovation, South Africa, for ‚Holistic strategies require a bird’s eye view’ Bronze Award: Matthew Turner, United Kingdom, for ‚Social is the solution to marketing’s esprit de l’escalier moments’ Bronze Award: Charlie Ebdy of Vizeum, United Kingdom, for ‚Screen Wipe: Why social media is slowly killing TV and how it could help transform advertising for the better’ Three Judges’ Commended Awards are awarded to: Gareth Price of The Social Partners, United Kingdom, for ‚Bridging the gap between activation and fame’; Jon Reay of e3 Media, United Kingdom, for ‚Standalone TV ads are nothing than creative indulgence’; and Satish Pai, India, for ‚The tipping points’. The winners will be presented with their awards at an Admap event in Cannes on Wednesday 21 June during which members of the Admap jury and senior industry experts will discuss burning issues around the marriage of TV and social and debate over short-term and long-term marketing strategy, To attend this free event, register at http://content.warc.com/register-for-warcs-session-in-cannes-admap-prize-2017-event. All award-winning essays are published in the June edition of Admap magazine and at www.warc.com/AdmapPrize.prize.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 June 2017 by wiseguyreports Diapers Market – Indian Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast 2017 – 2021 In India, of late, hygiene industry is experiencing an unprecedented growth as hygiene products are being adopted into the lifestyle of the masses. With the increased awareness and increasing purchasing power, customers are fast shifting from cloth nappies to baby diapers. Consumers today are looking for baby diapering solutions that go beyond the basic benefits of dryness and go the extra mile to incorporate value-adding features such as softness and caring for their baby’s delicate skin. Indians give birth to around 27 million babies each year, yet the penetration rate of baby diapers remains at less than two percent. Request a sample report @ https://www.wiseguyreports.com/sample-request/744750-india-diapers-market-outlook-2021 According to “India Diaper Market Outlook, 2021”, India’s diaper market was growing with a CAGR of 22.23% over past five years. In 2014, the market for baby diapers in urban India grew with a CAGR of 19.99% whereas in rural India the growth was much higher than urban. On the basis of age, the report categorizes the India diaper market into baby diapers and adult diapers. Baby diapers constitute the leading category in the market. During the forecast horizon, adult diapers market is expected to grow significantly due to the increasing healthcare standards in the country. However, social and economic constraints of using adult diapers are hampering the market growth. P&G’s Pampers dominates the overall diaper industry, followed by Huggies and Mamy Poko. P&G’s lack of innovation and focus on higher margins amid aggressive strategies adopted by its competitors to increase their market share is expected to decrease brand’s market share in future. Japanese firm Unicharm, which sells Mamy Poko diapers, overtook Kimberly Clark in baby diaper segment nearly two years ago. In baby diaper segment, Pampers, Mamy Poko and Huggies constitute more than 85% of the market by value whereas in adult diaper segment, Nobel Hygiene and Actifit dominate the industry heavily. Diapers are broadly categorized into two types i.e. disposable diapers and cloth diapers. Disposable diapers constitute the largest market share and are seeing increasing investments by manufacturers in their research and development. In the last few years modern cloth diapers have become a fast moving trend worldwide for families looking for a natural modern way to diaper their babies. Sales of cloth diapers were 140 lakh units in 2014 and are expected to climb up in the forecast period, owing to environmental benefits. Other type of diapers includes swim pants and training pants which has a marginal market share in India.

My local friends were using something else; they were all on Grab. Outside Southeast Asia, very few might have heard of Grab. But a lot of ink has been spilled in the region about the fight between the two car-hailing companies and how they have been able to prosper simultaneously. The world’s most valuable start-up and valued at US$68 billion, Uber has a war chest dwarfing that of Singapore-based Grab, which only amounts to US$4 billion. With Uber selling off its China operation to Didi Chuxing in August last year, Southeast Asia has become the next must-win battle. Curiously enough, Grab has claimed more than 95 per cent of the market share in places including Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines. This is strange. In our increasingly connected economy, scale matters. Big companies often enjoy vast profits. McKinsey, a global consultancy, estimates that 10 per cent of the world’s public companies generate 80 per cent of all profits. So how do we explain that the tiny Grab has managed to ward off Uber for so long, with no sign of being upstaged any time soon? Among business school academics, the so-called network effect is a common explanation for the rise of Uber, Airbnb and Alibaba Group Holding. In each of these cases, the company took on the role of a two-sided marketplace, facilitating sellers on the supply side and buyers on the demand side to exchange goods or services. The value of such a platform depends in large part on the number of users on either side of the exchange. The deeper the market, that is, the more people use something, the more inherently attractive the platform becomes, leading even more people to use it. Consider for a moment any dating website from OkCupid to Tinder to Match.com. Men are drawn towards them because there is a huge supply of women, with a good match more likely to result, and vice versa. Because of this network effect, users are willing to pay more for access to a bigger network and so a company’s profits improve when its user base grows. Scale begets scale. With little to differentiate products fundamentally – think Uber against Lyft or iMessage against WhatsApp – competition is often reduced to a game of “grow fast or die”. That is why Facebook is obsessed with growth. That is also why when SnapChat went public in March this year, the number of daily active users became the single most important metric for potential investors. The more people hang out on Facebook or SnapChat reading news and playing games, the more willing big brands like Coca-Cola or Procter & Gamble are to buy ads there. Once a platform reaches a certain size, its dominance was thought to be hard to unseat. But it turns out size is more of a consequence than the direct source of greatness. To be truly successful, any platform must achieve what is known in Silicon Valley as the product/market fit. And what fits well in one country can fare badly in another. Twelve years ago, eBay, with global revenues of more than US$2 billion, entered China. In a defensive move, Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba swiftly set up Taobao. Taobao prevailed. “When we were fighting with eBay, we listed 10 things that eBay was doing in China and that we did 100 per cent differently,” David Wei, former group executive vice-president for Alibaba’s e-commerce business, explained in an interview with CNN on how his company forced eBay to back out of China. “For example, they charge a listing fee, we don’t. The ranking orders of eBay are based on the auction base, which means the products that have been on there for the longest time will be on top. But in the retail model, you should put the freshest on top. “EBay also stops people from talking to each other because it’s an auction model, but in China we launched instant messenger encouraging people to talk to each other. The top 10 things eBay was doing, we completely changed in China. Their winning recipes in the US actually became the poison killing their business in China.” The larger story is also that eBay’s target customers, namely small-time manufacturers that wished to export their wares to America, did not yet have access to the internet. Alibaba founder Jack Ma Yun understood this all too well. He assembled a huge sales force that fanned out across the country, teaching merchants how to get wired. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post. But this is not just about China. (Though one would be tempted to draw such a conclusion when reading the similar tale of Baidu, Huawei Technologies and Tencent Holdings’ WeChat). Grab, for one, has exploited the same dynamics to its full advantage, but only in Southeast Asia. Anthony Tan, co-founder and chief executive of GrabTaxi, saw the imperative to understand, appreciate and build regional distinctions into a product. In the Philippines, for example, eight major dialects are spoken. When someone calls Grab’s customer service, they would speak in the local dialect. “We understood the taxi driver’s need for daily income. We understood that a lot of people really use cash. We respect the hyper local culture in places we operate,” Tan said. The lack of trust and scanty safety records also plague the taxi industry in Asia. To help, riders can retrieve drivers’ police records through the app and can share routes and number plates with friends and family. In Indonesia where road congestion is endemic, GrabBike offers rides on motorcycles. Gathering GPS data as tens of thousands of motorcyclists navigate copious back roads and side streets to avoid traffic, Grab’s route-planning suggestion has surpassed even Google Maps. All of this suggests that Silicon Valley behemoths, which sail out from the West Coast and think like an imperial armada to establish beachheads on every other continent, have been dangerously misled. Yes, the world may have made flat by the internet, but a start-up like Grab can still thrive.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Laxatives Market Research Report: Technological breakthroughs, Value chain and stakeholder analysis by 2024 Laxatives Market Laxatives are supplements used to loosen the stools in order to increase bowel movements. These are used in order to treat constipation. They are used to treat the passage of small amounts of hard and dry stools. Laxatives are generally taken three times a week. They are preferred as medication when remedies such as increase in fiber diet, drinking plenty of water and regular exercise have not helped to cure constipation. Occasional constipation is often treated without laxatives. Laxatives are available as OTC drugs without the need of prescriptions. Although laxatives are present in the market for a longer period of time there is insufficient evidence available about the efficacy of laxatives over each other. Adults usually don’t require prescription for consumption of laxatives as they are easily available as OTC drugs. In children laxatives are only advised to be taken through prescription. The nature of laxatives depends on whether it degenerates the nerves in the intestine or dulling the natural response that will stimulate the peristalsis movement. The laxative market can be segmented according to the route of administration, types of laxatives, by type of product, distribution channel and geography. According to route of administration the market is segmented is into oral and rectal. According to the types of laxatives the market is segmented into bulk forming laxatives, osmotic laxatives, stimulant laxatives and stool softener laxatives. Bulk forming laxatives show their effect after 12-24 hours of administration, osmotic laxatives such as lactulose show their effect after 2-3 days of administration, stimulant laxatives usually work within 6-12 hours of administration and stool softener laxatives work within 12 to 72 hours of administration. According to type of product the laxatives are segmented according to dosage form such as tablets, capsules, powder, suppositories, liquids and gels According to distribution channel the market is segmented into retail pharmacies, hospital pharmacies, drug store and online pharmacies. Geographically, the laxatives market can be segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Middle East and Africa. Constipation has become one of the major problems amongst the majority population due to sedentary life style. Sedentary life style includes unhealthy eating habits, less hours of sleep, irregular meal timings and lack of exercise which causes gastric imbalance which can further lead to constipation. This is the major driving factor for the growth of laxative market in the forecast period. Obesity is also a major factor responsible for constipation, hence rising obese cases are one the major reason for the growth of laxative market. Few of the restraints in the laxative market can be due to the side effects of laxatives which are bloating, flatulence, abdominal cramps, feeling sick and dehydration. The side effects caused are generally not taken into more consideration as the constipation itself is a troublesome condition. Use of laxatives as in treatment of obesity has also been one of the restraining factor for the laxative market.

Photo: Wee Teck Hian mail print View all comments Tweet By Siau Ming En - siaumingen@mediacorp.com.sg - Published: 4:00 AM, June 2, 2017 Updated: 6:26 AM, June 2, 2017 SINGAPORE — Services to persons with intellectual disabilities can often be provided in fragments, but things may change now that Mr Tony Tan See-Boon, former chief of social enterprise NTUC Link, is heading the Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore (Minds). He also intends to build on the voluntary welfare organisation’s services and expand them, including hiring more staff members, in order to reach out to more persons with intellectual disabilities. Mr Tan, 53, officially joined Minds on May 22 as its chief executive officer (CEO), taking over from Mr Keh Eng Song, 62, who retired after a 10-year stint there. RelatedNews Singapore A ‘worthwhile endeavour’, thanks to input from wife June 2 Speaking to TODAY, Mr Tan noted that while the current services provided to persons with intellectual disabilities might be necessary for those who have different needs at various points in their lives, others need a more “whole-person” approach to help them transit into different stages of their lives. “Everything that we do — our assessments, our intervention, our educational and training programme — must, in a way, be mutually reinforcing and also build on each other, almost like building a scaffolding,” he explained. While it seems “conceptually obvious” to provide continuous help to its clients — and there are already services in place — Minds can provide more vocational training in its schools to help its clients ease into the workforce upon graduation. “Schools are very important, but there is no point going through school to get some qualification,” he said. “What we need to do is to build in a lot of the vocational aspects, so that in the early times in school, we already have the good assessment tools to see (the person’s potential and) work towards that.” While Minds already serves a broad swathe of its target community, Mr Tan also hopes to expand the organisation’s capabilities and services to help more children who are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders, for instance. The father of two sons aged 23 and 21 took a pay cut in accepting his new role, but he said the new position felt like a “natural progression” from his previous job. “NTUC Enterprises was a very good transition into that space, and I feel like in my next career phase, a social service organisation like Minds would be so much more purposeful and meaningful,” he added. Mr Tan spent seven-and-a-half years at NTUC Link, helping to build its Plus! customer rewards programme, which serves about 90 per cent of the households here. Before that, he was with multinational corporation Procter & Gamble and American healthcare company Bausch & Lomb Corp. Given that Minds is a large organisation offering a wide range of services, he hopes that his leadership experience in complex organisations, as well as his management skills in working with stakeholders such as government agencies and corporations, will come in useful. Minds employs about 700 people and serves some 2,400 clients aged seven to 70 years old. Under its umbrella are special education schools, employment development centres, training and development centres, and a caregivers support centre, among others. During Mr Keh’s time, Minds set up more day-activity centres and a community group home in Bukit Merah, where some of its more independent clients are able to live in public housing flats. mail print View all comments Tweet Recommended For You   More Stories For You The Most Singapore READ COMMENTED “Good progress” made in containing oil spillage after recent collisions “Bedding-in” period of several months to be expected for DTL2: Khaw ‘Zero tolerance’ for religious preaching that fans violence: Shanmugam ‘You have made Singapore very proud today’: PM Lee to Yip Pin Xiu ‘Wrecked dorm’ videos an isolated incident: SCDF ‘Singaporeans owe a profound debt of gratitude to E W Barker’ ‘Guardian angels’ watch over autistic teen in public Yaacob rules himself out of Presidential Election Woman who used Lee Kuan Yew’s name to cheat others charged Warmer days in June as Singapore enters Southwest Monsoon season Wake up to a better you URA releases three sites that can yield 1,955 homes United Airlines announces direct flights between Singapore and Los Angeles Two men arrested for causing public alarm after leaving bags unattended at MRT station Two charged with wrecking Upper Serangoon porridge eatery Inside Today World Trump takes battle over travel ban to nation’s highest court Trump dismays, angers allies by abandoning global climate pact Fight against ‘internal terrorism’ biggest hurdle for Malaysia Afghan police fire into air to disperse demonstrators in Kabul: witnesses At least 36 dead in attack on Philippines casino: official Business World stocks hit record high as upbeat data boosts confidence Pennsylvania pipeline fight could upend international oil flows Strong U.S. job growth expected in May; wage rise seen moderate Oil prices slide amid glut concerns, U.S. withdrawal from climate deal Waymo working on self-driving trucks Sports Changes long overdue: FAS affiliates Barcelona’s new coach takes aim at Madrid Lee Wung Yew, Mark Chay appointed Team Singapore deputy CDMs for SEA Games Venus Williams lets slip on Serena’s baby secret Slurring, unsteady Tiger Woods shown in police video Entertainment Once-censored, Cubans now rock to the Beatles at Havana tribute concert Al Gore’s Inconvenient Truth sequel to include Trump’s exit from Paris Accord Actor who posted about Ah Boys to Men 4 audition questioned by cops Wonder Woman sets out on her quest to transform Hollywood Ariana Grande to return to Manchester for star-studded benefit gig About TODAY Apps RSS Sitemap Syndication Contact Us Advertise with Us Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy About MediaCorp Copyright 2017 © Mediacorp Press Ltd.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai speaks during a Google product launch event in San Francisco last fall. Credit: Michael Short/Bloomberg Google's Chrome browser will soon come with preinstalled technology that will block the most annoying ads currently marring the web experience, the company confirmed on Thursday. Publishers will be able to understand how they will be affected through a tool Google is dubbing "The Ad Experience Report." It will basically score a publisher's site and inform them which of their ads are "annoying experiences." At the same time, Chrome will give publishers the option to force a choice on people running their own ad blocking software: whitelist the site so its non-annoying ads can display or pay a small fee to access the content ad-free. The moves, which had been anticipated since word got out in April but hadn't been previously confirmed by Google, will impact the entire advertising ecosystem because Chrome is the most popular web browser for both desktop and mobile. "We've all known for a while that the ad experience is a real problem, and that it's confused and angered users," Sridhar Ramaswamy, senior VP of ads and commerce at Google, told Ad Age. "We realized solutions like ad blockers punish everybody, including publishers who develop great content and are thoughtful about the ad experience they put on their site." Google isn't calling its technology an ad blocker, instead classifying it as a "filter" that removes the ads that consumers hate most. These include popups, ads that flash quickly, change colors or force people to wait 10 seconds before accessing content on a publisher's page. The effort to install such software on Chrome is a result of work by the Coalition for Better Ads, whose members include Google, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, WPP's GroupM, Facebook, Thomson Reuters, The Washington Post as well as the Interactive Advertising Bureau and the Association of National Advertisers. In an effort to develop a Better Ads Standard and slow the spread of ad-blocking software, the Coalition set out to determine which ad formats were most at fault. It paid some 25,000 study participants in the U.S. and Europe to rate 104 different ad experiences on desktop and mobile. Chrome's "filter" is informed partly by the results. The industry is particularly eager to keep ad blocking from taking off on mobile devices, where it has a 1% adoption rate, the way it already has on desktop computers, where the figure is 18%, according to Mary Meeker's 2017 Internet Trends report. "We think getting ads right is really, really important to the future for the internet. We love the sources of information that makes the internet great," Ramaswamy said. "What's scary is ad blocking has been a big problem on desktop and has been a big problem for the last few years." "Hopefully leading to a much better, much stable ecosystem for everybody," he added. "We are very excited about what we're announcing and doing here." The option for publishers to charge for ad-free access is called Funding Choices. "We want to provide consumers with choice," Scott Spencer, director of product management at Google, told Ad Age. "The publisher will get compensated either way and it will help explain to the consumer the value of advertising." Users who opt to shell out to avoid ads will pay with their Google Play account, Spencer said. Google said it expects to roll out the features in early 2018.

More than three million American workers and counting now earn a living in the clean energy sector. The international clean energy market is worth an astounding $1.4 trillion a year. Delivering on the promise of the Paris climate agreement would unlock an estimated $19 trillion in economic growth globally. By pulling out of the Paris Agreement, President Trump just told those three million American workers he doesn’t care about their jobs. He’s invited signatories to levy carbon tariffs on U.S. goods shipped overseas – a step the European Union and other countries are now considering. And he has signaled he’s willing leave America on sidelines (alongside Syria and Nicaragua, the only other countries not part of the Paris Agreement) while other countries take leadership on climate and clean energy – and reap the economic rewards that come with it. China, for instance, is investing at least $360 billion on renewable energy in the next three years. Already the world’s biggest producer of solar energy, China is now home to five of the six largest solar panel manufacturing firms. Two years ago, it overtook the United States as the largest market for electric vehicles.  In turn, China has created millions of clean energy jobs, helping lead to an annual economic growth rate of nearly seven percent. American businesses don’t want to play second fiddle to China or any other country. That’s why more than 1,100 companies signed a statement backing the Paris Agreement and low-carbon policies. It’s why more than 30 CEOs from Goldman Sachs to Dow Chemical Company to Procter & Gamble took out a full-page ad calling for continued U.S. participation in the Paris Agreement. And it’s why, while President Trump was at the G-7 meetings in Italy last week, more than 365 business leaders and investors from large, medium and small businesses signed yet another letter imploring President Trump not to take away business opportunities by pulling our country out of the Paris Agreement. Plain and simple, American companies know the Paris climate agreement is good for business. It’s a chance to ensure America leads in a thriving new energy sector, instead of falling behind competitors. Unfortunately, President Trump didn’t listen to business leaders, his Secretary of State, or other clear voices of reason who advised him that pulling out of Paris will hurt our international relations, our economy and our environment. Now it’s up to others to fill the void he’s left. Congress can start by not agreeing to the drastic and draconian cuts President Trump has proposed for the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) – cuts that would eliminate the highly successful Energy Star efficiency program, DOE’s energy R&D programs, and slash funding for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects across America. States must continue to find ways to lead where Washington is failing us. While President Trump was pulling out of Paris, the California legislature pushed forward plans to get 100 percent of the state’s power from renewables. Other states are making similar moves because they know jobs, investments and a cleaner air and water come with it. And business leaders must continue to lead by example by expanding their own sustainability efforts, demanding more clean energy for their factories and offices and making it known in Congress, in the states and on the international stage, that they support action on climate and clean energy. Even if our president continues to ignore them. Mindy Lubber is CEO and president of Ceres, a nonprofit sustainability advocacy organization working with the most influential investors and companies to build leadership and drive solutions throughout the economy. Bob Keefe is executive director of E2, a national nonpartisan group of business owners, investors and others who advocate for policies that are good for the economy and good for the environment.

India withdraws 500 and 1,000 rupee notes in effort to fight corruption Read more Analysts said the 6.1% GDP growth figure for the January to March quarter – compared with China’s 6.9% – reflected a general economic slowdown in the south Asian giant, compounded by the shock demonetisation of 500 and 1,000 rupee banknotes, worth approximately £6 and £12. The move led to months of acute cash shortages across India that hit the country’s manufacturing and construction sectors particularly hard, the former recording slower growth than in the same period last year. The construction sector contracted by 3.7%. The cash recall was intended to hasten the country’s transition towards a formal economy and close down the booming economy of untaxed cash transactions, which aid corruption, the funding of terrorist groups and keeps counterfeit notes in circulation. It was also expected to unearth stashes of untaxed wealth in a country where just 1% pay income tax. India’s Reserve Bank is yet to say how much “black money” was deposited in banks but early indications suggest it was less than expected. India's small businesses facing 'apocalypse' amid biggest financial experiment in history Read more Gurchuran Das, an economic commentator, said the lagging growth was well below the rate India required to create enough jobs to match the number of new entrants to the workforce, estimated to be roughly 1 million people a month. “It shows that demonetisation was a big mistake,” he said. “What this has done is put us back about six months. We should have been inching towards 8% annual growth, but have ended up around 7.1%. “We’ve really got to be at 9% growth to create the jobs we need,” he said. “Already we were having problems creating those jobs, but demonetisation has exacerbated it by a couple of quarters.” He said the economy had bounced back after cash shortages eased in January and the country was likely reach 8% growth in the next three to four years, a prediction shared by the global ratings agency Moody’s. India's banknote ban: how Modi botched the policy yet kept his political capital Read more Arvind Subramanian, India’s chief economist, said the reduction in growth was “quite expected” after demonetisation, and that the replenishment of cash stocks and the monsoon period would help the economy rebound. Growth in India has been slowing since the middle of 2016, according to HSBC, but Das said the country’s economy was generally wellmanaged. “The inflation rate is the lowest it’s been in five years, the fiscal deficit has come down, and India has in fact become the largest destination for foreign investment in the world,” the former CEO of Procter & Gamble India said. He added that the key to creating high-productivity jobs in the formal sector was expanding India’s share of global exports, currently around 1.7%. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Prime Minister Narendra Modi arriving in St Petersburg on Wednesday. Photograph: Tass/Barcroft Images India is preparing to introduce a national goods and services tax in July that is expected to make the country a more attractive destination for foreign investment, cut red tape for business and increase trade between states. But Moody’s has warned the country needs to further reduce debt levels if it hopes to boost its international credit rating, currently just above junk status. Although the implementation of demonetisation was seen as botched by some, the policy is thought to have been a political coup for the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. In March, he decisively won an election in India’s largest state that was seen as a referendum on the scheme.

Dollar General Corporation Reports First Quarter 2017 Financial Results Net Sales Increased 6.5%; Same-Store Sales Increased 0.7% Diluted Earnings Per Share of $1.02, Including Approximately $0.01 Charge for the Early Retirement of Long-Term Obligations $160 Million of Capital Returned to Shareholders in the Quarter Company Confirms Fiscal Year 2017 Diluted EPS Guidance; Updates Other Guidance Board of Directors Declares Second Quarter 2017 Dividend June 01, 2017 06:55 AM Eastern Daylight Time GOODLETTSVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dollar General Corporation (NYSE: DG) today reported financial results for its 2017 first quarter (13 weeks) ended May 5, 2017. “For the first quarter of 2017, I am pleased with our earnings results which reflect solid management of the business in a difficult retail environment as we overcame our most challenging comparisons from the prior year. Our same-store sales improved as we moved past the delay in income tax refunds and the timing shift of the later Easter holiday. We continue to execute on our focused strategy and implement our operating initiatives which we believe will improve customer traffic and transactions,” said Todd Vasos, Dollar General’s chief executive officer. First Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights Net sales increased 6.5 percent to $5.61 billion in the 2017 first quarter compared to $5.27 billion in the 2016 first quarter. Same-store sales in the 2017 first quarter increased 0.7 percent over the 2016 first quarter primarily due to an increase in average transaction amount, partially offset by a decline in traffic. Same-store sales were driven by positive results in the consumables and apparel categories, partially offset by negative results in the home and seasonal categories. The net sales increase was also positively affected by sales from new stores, partially offset by sales from closed stores. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 30.3 percent in the 2017 first quarter compared to 30.6 percent in the 2016 first quarter, a decrease of 34 basis points. The gross profit rate decrease was primarily attributable to higher markdowns, primarily for inventory clearance and promotional activities, a greater proportion of sales of consumables, which tend to have a lower gross profit rate as compared to non-consumables, and the mix within consumables. Partially offsetting these items were higher initial inventory markups. Selling, general and administrative expense (“SG&A”), as a percentage of net sales was 21.8 percent in the 2017 first quarter compared to 21.5 percent in the 2016 first quarter, an increase of 34 basis points as a percentage of net sales. The SG&A increase was primarily attributable to increased labor costs, primarily as a result of the Company’s investment in store manager compensation, and occupancy costs, which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales. Partially offsetting these costs were a reduction in advertising costs and lower waste management costs resulting from the Company’s recycling efforts. The Company’s net income and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) for the 2017 first quarter were $279 million and $1.02, respectively, compared to net income and diluted EPS of $295 million and $1.03, respectively, in the 2016 first quarter. Diluted EPS for the 2017 first quarter includes a charge of approximately $0.01 related to the early retirement of long-term obligations. The effective income tax rate in the 2017 first quarter was 37.2 percent compared to 35.4 percent in the 2016 first quarter. The effective income tax rate was higher in the 2017 first quarter due primarily to the recognition of a tax benefit of approximately $9.0 million or $0.03 per diluted share in the 2016 quarter associated with stock-based compensation that did not reoccur in the 2017 quarter. Merchandise Inventories As of May 5, 2017, total merchandise inventories, at cost, were $3.30 billion compared to $3.07 billion as of April 29, 2016, an increase of 0.5 percent on a per-store basis. Capital Expenditures Total additions to property and equipment in the 2017 first quarter were $144 million, including: $54 million for distribution and transportation-related capital expenditures; $50 million for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; and $35 million related to new leased stores, primarily for leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment. During the 2017 first quarter, the Company opened 293 new stores and remodeled or relocated 301 stores. Share Repurchases The Company repurchased $89 million, or 1.3 million shares, under its share repurchase program in the first quarter of 2017, at an average price of $70.86 per share. Since December 2011 through the end of the first quarter of 2017, the Company has repurchased 75.6 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $4.7 billion, at an average price of $61.57 per share. The total remaining authorization for future repurchases was approximately $845 million at the end of the 2017 first quarter. The authorization has no expiration date. Dividend On May 31, 2017, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per share on the Company’s common stock. The second quarter dividend will be payable on July 25, 2017 to shareholders of record at the close of business on July 11, 2017. Acquisition In April 2017, the Federal Trade Commission approved the Company’s proposed purchase of 322 store locations in 36 states from a small-box multi-price point retailer. The transaction is expected to close during June 2017, subject to customary closing conditions. The store sites are anticipated to be converted to the Dollar General banner by the end of November 2017. The acquisition of these sites is expected to be incremental to the Company’s 2017 new store growth by approximately 290 new stores over the prior guidance of 1,000 new stores for fiscal 2017. The Company anticipates sales from the acquired sites to impact fiscal 2017 (as defined below in “Financial Outlook”) net sales by approximately 100 basis points. The Company anticipates the acquisition will be modestly accretive to EPS for the fiscal year. An estimated $0.02 per diluted share charge is forecasted in the second quarter primarily related to lease termination costs for a small number of overlapping store locations, as well as ancillary costs related to the pending store locations. No assurances can be given that the transaction will be closed or will be closed within the expected timeframe or that the store sites will be converted to the Dollar General banner within the timeframe anticipated. Any failure to close the transaction or a delay in such closing or in the conversion of the store sites to the Dollar General banner would impact the financial estimates and store count outlined above. Financial Outlook For the 52-week fiscal year ending February 2, 2018 (“fiscal 2017”), and including the anticipated closing of the transaction discussed above under “Acquisition,” GAAP diluted EPS is forecasted to remain consistent with the prior guidance range of $4.25 to $4.50. Assuming such transaction is consummated as planned and the store sites are converted to the Dollar General banner on the expected timeframe, as detailed above, the Company’s net sales are forecasted to increase by approximately five to seven percent as compared with the prior guidance range of four to six percent and capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 are expected to be in the range of $715 million to $765 million as compared with the prior guidance range of $650 million to $700 million. The Company’s same-store sales growth is unchanged from the prior guidance range of slightly positive to an increase of two percent. Share repurchases for fiscal 2017 continue to be forecasted to be approximately $450 million. For fiscal 2017, assuming the closing of the acquisition as discussed above, the Company plans to open approximately 1,290 new stores in addition to remodeling or relocating 760 stores and to reduce the Company’s total projects for remodels and relocations by 140 to allow for organizational capacity to execute the incremental new store growth anticipated to result from the pending acquisition.

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking information, including statements regarding the Company’s outlook, plans and intentions, including, but not limited to, statements made within the quotations of Mr. Vasos and in the sections entitled “Acquisition” and “Financial Outlook”. A reader can identify forward-looking statements because they are not limited to historical fact or they use words such as “outlook,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “expect,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “confident,” “opportunities,” “goal,” “prospect,” “positioned,” “intend,” “committed,” “continue,” “looking ahead,” “going forward,” “focused on,” or “will likely result,” and similar expressions that concern the Company’s strategy, plans, intentions or beliefs about future occurrences or results. These matters involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual performance of the Company to differ materially from that which the Company expected. Many of these statements are derived from the Company’s operating budgets and forecasts as of the date of this release, which are based on many detailed assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable.

And no single individual, company or government can bring about the scale of change needed. But everyone — from governments to businesses and civil society — has a stake in building a sustainable future. Together, we can deliver solutions on a global scale. For the past eight years, the federal government has been squarely in the vanguard of clean-energy policy and action on climate change. But today, the political landscape in Washington is shifting. And just as the current administration considers rolling back much of the recent progress on these crucial issues, the private sector is taking up the mantle of climate leadership. At first blush, businesses may seem an unlikely candidate for this new role. But increasingly, businesses are recognizing the bottom line value of a low-carbon economy. For them, sustainability is an opportunity to generate economic value and advance lasting solutions to one of society’s greatest common challenges. As America’s engine of innovation, businesses are particularly well-suited for this task. Throughout our nation’s history, leaders of industry have been the driving force behind the advent of new technologies and practices, changing not just the way we do business, but our very way of life. Now they are tapping into that same wellspring of ingenuity to address the threat of climate change. And for those on the leading edge, investments in sustainability are already yielding dividends. Nearly half of American Fortune 500 companies have set climate targets. Last year alone, their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated $3.7 billion in savings. As businesses of all sizes establish climate targets, many are becoming more ambitious with their goals. Around the world, more than 200 companies have set targets aligned with the best available climate science. Globally, 95 companies have committed to power their operations with 100 percent renewable energy, compared to only a handful of companies just a few years ago. Some companies are expanding their efforts to reduce GHG emissions and waste by shifting the focus to their supply chains (which on average account for four times more emissions than a company’s direct operations). Walmart, for example, recently launched Project Gigaton, a groundbreaking endeavor that aims to reduce one gigaton (one billion tons) of emissions from their global supply chain by 2030. Apple also continues to pursue bold commitments. Apple’s global facilities are now at 96 percent renewable energy, including 100 percent renewable energy for their data centers around the world, and they are driving clean energy adoption in their supply chain to address manufacturing emissions. Apple is also partnering with the nonprofit sector to tackle the critical issues of deforestation and forest degradation – responsible for an estimated 15 percent of all global GHG emissions. Through a five-year project, Apple and WWF are helping China—the world’s largest producer and consumer of paper products—reduce its environmental footprint by producing paper products from responsibly managed forests within its own borders. A major goal of the project is for 1 million acres of forest land to be certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) or under improved forest management. We are well on our way to reaching the goal. Approximately 320,000 acres of forest land are in the final stage of receiving FSC certification and eight companies have committed to improving the management of 450,000 acres of forest land. Apple, with partners like us, is now protecting or creating enough responsibly managed forest to cover all of the virgin fiber needed for their packaging. P&G is tackling climate change through an integrated approach that includes setting science-based targets, an ambitious renewable energy goal of 30 percent by 2020 and 100 percent long-term. They are also increasing energy efficiencies across their 100 manufacturing sites globally, which has resulted in $500 million in savings since 2010. And, they recently encouraged the American consumer to adopt energy-saving laundry habits through the Sustainable Laundry Pledge. Apple, P&G, and Walmart are not alone. Savvy business leaders across a wide range of industries are steaming full speed ahead toward the low carbon horizon. And more are joining their ranks every year. But our greatest challenges still lay ahead. And we need more leaders to heed the clarion call to action. When businesses like Apple, P&G, and Walmart make large-scale investments in the renewable energy space, it sends a powerful signal to their peers. And as more businesses engage in collective initiatives, they find it easier to lift up proven solutions and take them to scale. While these companies scale up their targets, many are also becoming more vocal in their support for local, state, national, and international policies—including the historic Paris Agreement—in order to accelerate America’s transition to a low-carbon economy and to make the U.S. more competitive in the world economy. Long-term growth requires long-term vision. Now more than ever, America’s business leaders see the value of making sustainability business as usual. And that is reason for optimism.

"We are writing to express our strong support for the United States remaining in the Paris Climate Agreement," it said. "President Trump, stay in Paris and negotiate a better deal that creates jobs," according to the commercial that is also available on YouTube. The advertisement was signed by the heads of 3M, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Proctor & Gamble, General Electric, Johnson & Johnson, The Dow Chemical Company, Tesla, Citigroup and The Disney Company. The Paris Agreement, which was spearheaded by former President Barack Obama and signed by 195 countries in April 2016, aims to fight climate change by reducing carbon emissions and limiting global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius. During his election campaign, however, Trump called global warming "a hoax" and promised to scrap the agreement and return jobs to the coal industry that is often an easy target for environmentalists. "I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!," Trump said via Twitter on Wednesday.
