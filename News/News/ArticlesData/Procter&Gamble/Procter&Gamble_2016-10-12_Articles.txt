From the paring down of the freedom of religion to the freedom of worship to the basket of deplorables, Hillary Clinton’s comments were certainly clues of her campaign’s disdain for those whose faith is important in their lives. Those clues were confirmed this week in a scandal involving two chiefs of the campaign. Proving that Donald Trump’s mouth isn’t the only liability in this race, Clinton’s Communications Director, Jennifer Palmiere, has gotten the campaign in plenty of hot water with her 2011 email exchange with equally prejudiced John Halpin from the Center for American Progress. The messages (which also included Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta) surfaced in the latest WikiLeaks dump, giving undecided voters plenty to think about before November 8. Halpin kicked off the insult-fest with a nod to the CEO of Fox News, Rupert Murdoch, a Catholic who — shock of shocks — raised his children Catholic. “Ken Auletta’s latest piece on Murdoch in the New Yorker starts off with the aside that both Murdoch and Robert Thompson, managing editor of the WSJ, are raising their kids Catholic. Friggin' Murdoch baptized his kids in Jordan where John the Baptist baptized Jesus,” he wrote to Palmiere and Podesta. Going on, he added, “Many of the most powerful elements of the conservative movement are all Catholic (many converts) from the SC and think tanks to the media and social groups. It’s an amazing bastardization of the faith. They must be attracted to the systematic thought and severely backwards gender relations and must be totally unaware of Christian democracy.” They’re probably Catholic, Hillary’s Communications Director chimed in, because they think it’s “the most socially acceptable politically conservative religion.” Then, taking a swipe at Protestants, she said, “Their rich friends wouldn’t understand if they became evangelicals.” The comments are revealing because they show that Hillary Clinton’s attack on Bible-believing Christians (when she called them a “basket of deplorables,” in front of an LGBTQ crowd) were consistent with the broader campaign’s contempt for conservative Christians. Even more telling, she not only smeared those who believe in biblical morality as deplorable, she also said they were “irredeemable” (which was a bit ironic, considering that redemption is the crux of the Christian faith). Unfortunately, this is just par for the intolerant course in the Clinton campaign, which has just as much contempt for Christians' beliefs on issues like abortion, religious liberty, marriage, gender identity, and sexuality. A staunch supporter of the culture of death, Planned Parenthood, abortion mandates, same-sex marriage, transgender rights, and more, Hillary has been offending the Christian faith that she claims to hold for the last 30 years. And it’s clear that her staff is cut from the same cloth. What’s even more infuriating is that the campaign will go to the mat to protect American Muslims, but when it comes to conservative Catholics and evangelicals, Clinton — like most liberals — thinks that’s an acceptable form of discrimination. As I told Megyn Kelly [Tuesday] night on Fox News (video below), this should be troubling to anyone who wants to live by their faith. Clinton and her staff honestly believe that people who actually want to live by their faith are backwater people. The elitists see religion as a glorified social club — but if you want to live your life according to Scripture, they hold you in disdain. And talk about a double standard! The Left is demanding Donald Trump’s head for his deplorable comments about women, but they give Clinton’s campaign a pass for abusing the world’s largest religion! Imagine if the GOP’s team had said what Halpin and Palmiere did. They’d be in the streets with pitchforks! Trump alluded as much at a rally today, where he blasted his opponent for harboring such animosity in her camp. “The new e-mails also show members of the Clinton team attacking Catholic and Evangelicals… viciously. That will not be tolerated by the voters… This is hatred from Hillary Clinton… I tell you what, can you imagine me if any of this pertained to me? Front page headlines.” Let this be a lesson to any Christian who thought Hillary Clinton may be a viable option to Donald Trump. Her campaign doesn’t respect your faith — and it sure doesn’t respect your right to practice it. Originally published here. Procter Doesn’t Gamble in North Carolina Consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (P&G) is hardly immune to pressure from LGBT (“lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender”) activists. It has boasted to its shareholders about treating “sexual orientation” and “gender identity and expression” as protected categories and about receiving a perfect score on the pro-LGBT Human Rights Campaign’s “Corporate Equality Index.” It has even endorsed “U.S. federal legislation that would prohibit workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity” (presumably, the dangerous so-called “Equality Act”). However, this week its shareholders drew the line at joining the corporate witch hunt against states that have passed modest legislation to protect religious liberty, privacy, and safety. P&G’s shareholders soundly rejected a proposal offered by NorthStar Asset Management, a small investment group headed by Julie Goodridge (lead plaintiff in the lawsuit, Goodridge v. Dept. of Public Health, that first brought same-sex “marriage” to Massachusetts). NorthStar criticized varied bills adopted this year by Mississippi (forbidding government discrimination against religious views), Tennessee (protecting conscience rights of counselors and therapists), and North Carolina (protecting bathrooms in government buildings), and requested that P&G prepare a report “detailing the known and potential risks and costs to the Company” from such laws. Justin Danhof of the National Center for Public Policy opposed the measure at the shareholders' meeting, pointing out false claims in the NorthStar proposal, and noting that the issues involved are largely irrelevant to P&G’s business. Danhof said that the proposals could damage the company’s brand and “harm the company’s bottom line while helping no one.” (Interestingly, NorthStar itself apparently engages in sex discrimination — hiring only women!) P&G’s Board of Directors concluded the proposal was worded too “broadly and vaguely,” and the proposed report “is unnecessary and would not provide meaningful information.” Shareholders agreed, with only six percent of the shares outstanding voting in favor of this attack upon state laws. Corporations should stay neutral in the culture wars; and certainly should not ally themselves with those attacking religious liberty. Originally published here. Bad Company: CA Takes Baby Body Parts Dealers to Task On Tuesday, the District Attorney of Orange County, California, filed a lawsuit against several medical research companies alleging they illegally profited off the sale of baby body parts or “fetal tissue.” According to the Orange County Register, the suit alleges that these companies are “illegally profiting off the sale of fetal tissue donated from abortion providers.” While the law allows firms to have their expenses covered for supplying “fetal tissue,” they cannot profit off it. However, the Orange County DA “alleges that DaVinci Biosciences and its sister company DV Biologics advertised and sold hundreds of units of fetal tissue and stem cells to research facilities around the world, collecting tens of thousands of dollars in revenue.” If proven, this is both atrocious and illegal. Interestingly, as the Center for Medical Progress (CMP) points out, the targets of the suit are “Planned Parenthood of Orange & San Bernardino Counties' longtime baby body parts business partners [and] sister companies.” It turns out that what’s atrocious may have occurred here. In a scheme taking place over the course of eight years, according to CMP, “Planned Parenthood supplied aborted baby hearts, lungs, brains, and intestines to DV Biologics, which DV Biologics then resold for profit. In exchange for merely providing access to aborted baby body parts, Planned Parenthood received kickback contributions from DaVinci Biosciences over the course of their eight-year contract.” It’s no surprise that DaVinci Biosciences and DV Biologics also profited from the sale of baby body parts as did its competitors StemExpress and Advanced Bioscience Resources (ABR), two such companies that were under investigation by the Select Panel on Infant Lives. The Select Panel already revealed in its interim report how StemExpress and ABR have profited from the sale of baby body parts, as evidenced by receipts, invoices, order forms, purchase orders, internal emails, and sales spreadsheets. One thing’s for sure — this case will shed light on some important issues. If DaVinci Biosciences is found guilty, it points to Planned Parenthood’s involvement and guilt as an accomplice in these matters. Could DaVinci Biosciences really have sold baby body parts for profit without Planned Parenthood’s intimate involvement in giving it access to fresh, intact fetal organs? Eight years is a long time, and it’s reasonable to infer that Planned Parenthood either knew or should have known what DaVinci Biosciences was doing over the course of those many years. Moreover, if one district attorney in California can bring such a case, evidence likely exists for authorities to bring such charges in other jurisdictions. Law enforcement elsewhere should follow suit and look into these allegations in the other states where they have arisen. We may ask, and the public should be asking: Could it be that CMP was right all along? Doesn’t this show what its videos claimed and what it previously alleged? When the CMP videos surfaced throughout last year, the mainstream media and many abortion supporters tried to minimize them and brush them away because of the inconvenient truths they contained and the implications for their biggest abortion patron: Planned Parenthood. The truth won’t go away, however, and this lawsuit and latest incidence of these atrocities at a minimum demand an honest investigation and accounting. Originally published here.

Speaking at Advertising Week 2016 in New York, Pritchard argued that P&G's digital campaigns do not always have to be aimed at an extremely granular, and narrow, group. "Every audience is a target," he said. (For more details of the company's approach, read Warc's exclusive report: Procter & Gamble rethinks reach on Facebook.) "So you need to think about, 'How many are you targeting?' If you want to reach all category buyers of toothpaste, it's almost everybody. If you want to reach pregnant women in their first trimester, it's a much narrower target." This assertion followed on from recent headlines in the national and trade press indicating that P&G was scaling back its use of targeted ads on Facebook – notions that Pritchard suggested were taken slightly out of context. "We wanted to get more reach," he said. And having discussed that objective with its partners at Facebook, the FMCG manufacturer learned that it should consider tweaking its own tactics in this area. "We looked at it, and said, 'We were making choices on targeting that were too narrow, in some cases.' In some cases, it was great," Pritchard said. "So we said, 'Look, let's open it up; let's get more reach.' So, now we can get 70 or 80 million users. And when we want to be targeted even more precisely, we do that." Drilling down into this subject, Pritchard reported that in the consumer-products business, brands with everyday usage must typically reach significant numbers of people with the right level of frequency. "Our brands have to be top of mind. They have to be top of mind because they use it every day, and they purchase it very frequently," he reminded the Advertising Week attendees.

Analyst John Staszak pointed out that the company exited less profitable brands and focused on increasing the organic growth. Although it might look lean and mean, there is nothing to worry about profitability or productivity. He sees Procter & Gamble continuing its share buyback program and a regular hike in dividend supporting upside in shares as several investors look dividend as an attractive one. Procter & Gamble has been boosting its dividend for more than six decades, and the current dividend yield is estimated at 3.00 percent. Related Link: Procter & Gamble Completes Transfer Of Specialty Beauty Business To Coty The brokerage lifted its fiscal year 2017 EPS projection from $3.90 to $4.00, citing the planned acceleration in R&D and advertising spend besides the recent positive earnings surprises. Similarly, the firm boosted its EPS estimate for fiscal year 2018 from $4.20 to $4.30. As a result, Argus thinks the shares are undervalued currently compared to the average 22–25 range on an annualized basis in the three-year period. "The company has taken steps to strengthen its business, including divesting Duracell in early 2016 and spinning off its beauty business to Coty in October. It is also working to reduce manufacturing costs and to boost organic growth by investing in R&D and increasing advertising spending," the brokerage said in a research note.

Under the terms of the agreement, Gain Life will join Solera's integrated network of partners who are preventing and managing chronic disease. Gain Life's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recognized Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) is one of the few lifestyle modification initiatives being made available that is focused on men and women's unique health and wellness needs. The company's DPP for males, ManUP Health, and females, PowerUP Health, offer individuals with prediabetes a 52- week program that curbs the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The program focuses on improving metabolic flexibility and changing mindsets with the guidance and accountability of a dedicated coach and support of peers, completely online by smart phone, tablet, or computer. Adding these gender specific offerings to Solera's growing roster of chronic disease prevention and management program partners, provides patients with even greater choice when it comes to selecting a personalized approach to lifestyle modification to help them achieve what they want (reduced health risks and weight loss), while building into the process what they really require (change in mindset). Through its preventative health network, Solera allows members of participating health plans to simply and easily enroll in a DPP best suited to meet their unique individual needs and preferences. For partners like Gain Life, Solera provides increased access to qualified patients and payer reimbursement while also helping to manage the back office logistics associated with administrating a chronic disease prevention program. "Currently, the majority of weight loss and diabetes prevention initiatives in the market today are not tailored to the proven health needs specific to each gender, which could possibly account for why over 80% of program participants are typically women," said Brenda Schmidt, CEO of Solera Health. "In our work at Solera, we are seeing a huge demand from health plan clients who are increasingly interested in DPPs that meet the specific needs of their diverse population. We believe that through Gain Life's targeted approach of honoring gender differences in life roles, values and identity has a huge opportunity to improve DPP program engagement for this unique demographic." The Gain Life DPP was created around the belief that a "one-size-fits-all" approach to healthcare, especially with regards to lifestyle intervention, simply isn't going to work. By meeting individual's where they live/work/play, understanding their circumstances, and tailoring the programs to meet their needs, the company is creating a more personable approach to diabetes prevention that empowers patients to take control of their own health. "We are excited to enter this partnership with Solera Health as the relationship increases exposure and access to Gain Life's gender-specific lifestyle change programs for those in need. At a broader level, the relationship affords us the opportunity to be part of the company's ambitious solution to one of the country's largest healthcare problems," said Sean Eldridge, CEO of Gain Life. "In our eyes, the more folks that team up and work together to further minimize the behaviors that lead to chronic disease, the better our chances of having of real impact on eradicating these conditions in the long term." About Solera Health Solera Health is a chronic disease prevention and management integrator that connects patients, payers, and physicians with a new class of non-clinical healthcare providers, simply and securely. Solera helps consolidate highly fragmented programs and services into one integrated network, allowing health plans and medical providers to increase consumer participation while lowering associated costs. Solera proactively identifies the "best fit" program provider based on each individual's unique needs and preferences, which has proven to have a significant impact on improved patient outcomes at a fraction of the cost of traditional medical care.

Fast-rising star, Dems say Jason Williams , jwilliams@enquirer.com 1:52 p.m. EDT October 13, 2016 Aftab Pureval (Photo: Provided) Politics Extra is a weekly column looking inside local politics (Scroll to the bottom to read "Micro-scoops & more") Political rookie Aftab Pureval is tirelessly working to gain name recognition among Hamilton County voters. In doing so, the Hamilton County Clerk of Courts candidate has caught the attention of Democratic power players from here to Columbus and Washington. The party has quickly slapped the "rising star" label on Pureval, the dapper Procter & Gamble attorney. "I got a call from Sherrod Brown and he said 'I've taken notice of Aftab Pureval. How can we get him elected?' " Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper said, referring to Ohio's senior U.S. senator. Brown is scheduled to be in Cincinnati on Friday for a fundraiser to help Pureval and other local candidates. In July, Pureval joined Pepper and others for a press conference in response to the GOP's nomination of Donald Trump for president. A video of the press conference caught the attention of a Democratic National Committee official in Washington. Pepper soon received a call from the DNC official inquiring about Pureval, a 34-year-old former federal prosecutor. "He has very quickly impressed a lot of people in Ohio and beyond," said Pepper, the former Hamilton County Commissioner and Cincinnati City Councilman. Catching the party's attention might be Pureval's biggest victory in this campaign, regardless of the election results. The Hyde Park resident faces a tough task in beating Republican incumbent Clerk of Courts Tracy Winkler. The GOP has long had a stranglehold on the clerk's office, and few names are more recognizable in Hamilton County politics than Winkler. Insiders tell Politics Extra multiple polls show Winkler with a sizable lead in the race. CINCINNATI.COM Watch: 'Aftab!' duck to quack on local TV Those were conducted before Pureval launched his first television ad this week, a fun 30-second spot featuring a duck puppet quacking "Aftab!" in a spoof of the Aflac insurance commercials. It's just the beginning of a $125,000 ad blitz leading up to the Nov. 8 election, and he has more money to spend. Perhaps no one has ever pursued the clerk's office as aggressively as Pureval, the son of Indian immigrants and a first-generation American. Pureval was granted a six-month leave of absence from P&G so he could campaign full-time. He has put 30,000 miles on his Jeep Grand Cherokee in the past 11 months campaigning across the county. Pureval has raised over $200,000, a lot for a clerk's race. He has laid out a clear vision for the office. Pureval says he'll establish a legal self-help center, form a housing court and upgrade technology to allow easier access to court documents. Who does all that for any local race, let alone the clerk of courts? That all-out effort has Ohio Democrats viewing Pureval as part of the "bench" of candidates Pepper is trying to build to better compete in future statewide and Congressional races. Pepper mentions Pureval and his efforts when talking to party leaders and donors across the state. "Aftab is in the PowerPoint," Pepper said. "He is a perfect example of the kind of talented person we are hoping to inspire to get into public office." Careful what you put in writing: Part 1 Head-scratcher of the week comes courtesy of Hyde Park Republican Tamie Sullivan, who is expected to run for City Council next year. "I am a Republican woman who is voting for Hillary Clinton for president," Sullivan wrote in an Enquirer op-ed. She's certainly not alone in choosing Clinton over Trump, but Sullivan might have severely jeopardized any hopes of a political career. Republicans certainly took notice after the op-ed posted to Cincinnati.com on Wednesday morning. “A vote for Hillary Clinton is almost automatically disqualifying from receiving Republican support,” Hamilton County GOP Chairman Alex Triantafilou told Politics Extra. Sullivan's political misstep could help Amy Murray's bid for re-election. There's probably only room for one white female Republican from Hyde Park on Council. Careful what you put in writing: The sequel The next head-scratching decision by a Republican comes courtesy of Don Robinson, Winkler's chief deputy bailiff. Robinson on Sept. 1 sent an email from his personal account to clerk of courts employees implying it was part of their jobs to campaign for Winkler. "Please don't let me run into you with another shirt on when you could/should have been wearing Winkler attire," Robinson wrote, according to the email provided by Pureval's campaign this week. "The other candidates know that since the clerk is running, and you work for her, that you SHOULD be wearing her attire." Robinson sent the email during work hours and it's a no-no to require public employees to get involved in politics. Elected officials often hire their political supporters to fill "patronage" jobs – both parties do it – and employees can help with campaigns on their off time. Robinson is a long-time public employee, and his message was inexcusable. Politics Extra asked Winkler if Robinson has been reprimanded. "I became aware of an email sent by an employee using his personal email account," Winkler said. "I was disappointed in his comments, as we have run a positive campaign with many great volunteers. I met with the employee and expressed my strong displeasure and told him that this type of comment will never be tolerated by me or anyone in my office. I've taken corrective action and I'm confident this will never happen again. I consider the matter closed." Micro scoops & more • "Orange Is The New Black" stars Taylor Schilling and KateMulgrew have accepted Pepper's invitation to come to Ohio and campaign. Schilling, who's won several awards for her leading role as "Piper Chapman" in the Netflix original series, Mulgrew ("Red") and Pepper will visit six college campuses across northern Ohio on Friday and Saturday. Pepper met the celebrities during an Ohio Democratic Party fundraiser in New York last month. "I asked them to come to Ohio, that they could really help inspire Millennials to get involved," Pepper said. "They’re very energized about it." • Take Charlie Winburn's talk of running for mayor seriously. Insiders say the Republican City Councilman has made several fundraising calls over the past few weeks. Winburn faces being term-limited off council next year, and no job opportunities have materialized so far. • After getting caught in the political crosshairs of the streetcar last week, the company in charge of operations went out and hired a local lobbyist. Transdev has contracted with Matt Davis, president of Downtown-based DSD Advisors. This is a good – and probably overdue – move by Transdev, which was hired 15 months ago. The city and SORTA have put pressure on Transdev to run more streetcars on weekends and speed up its service. Davis, the Cincinnati Chamber's former top lobbyist, is highly respected by local, state and Washington politicians. • City Councilman Christopher Smitherman this week continued his courtship with the Republican party by endorsing Pat DeWine for Ohio Supreme Court judge race this week. • Former local television anchor Clyde Gray has been hired as the spokesman for Democratic Congressional candidate Michele Young, who is running against incumbent Republican Steve Chabot. Gray has been running his own communications firm since retiring from TV in 2014, and this is his first venture into a political campaign. • Trump's campaign made a public-relations blunder here this week. It invited the media to Sunday's Hamilton County debate watch party, then didn't let an Enquirer reporter into the event. Later that night, the campaign said it was actually OK for the media to enter the 20th Century Theater in Oakley. It turned out to be a miscommunication between the paid staff in Columbus and volunteer leaders in Hamilton County. Just the latest display of amateur hour for Trump's campaign in the region.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Oct 13, 2016 at 12:30PM Unilever (NYSE:UL) on Oct. 13 posted third-quarter earnings results that kept the company squarely within management's financial goals for the year. However, there were signs in the report of growing headwinds in the consumer goods industry that could threaten the company's volume-driven expansion strategy. Let's take a look at Unilever's latest operating trends. What happened this quarter? Organic growth of 3% was at the low end of the company's target range of 3% to 5% gains for the full year. Other highlights of the quarter include: Unilever grew sales at its slowest pace in over a year, with gains falling to 3% this quarter from 5% in each of the prior three quarters. Additionally, organic growth came entirely from price gains as volume declined slightly and prices rose by 4%. These figures kept Unilever ahead of rival Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), which is aiming to expand at a 2% pace this year. The company's segments are growing faster than their corresponding markets. Unilever boosted market share in each of its four product categories, with the strongest growth coming in home care. The food business posted the weakest growth pace, but still had healthy market-share gains. Geographically, sales growth sped up in the key U.S. market, was flat in Europe, and slowed in Asia and Latin America due to challenging economic and competitive conditions. What management had to say "Our business continues to demonstrate its resilience by growing competitively and consistently in tough market conditions," CEO Paul Polman said in a press release. "This was driven by strong innovations in support of our category strategies." As an example of these innovations, management cited the expansion of the Hellmann's mayonnaise brand into the popular organic segment and with the addition of new flavors like wasabi. USG = underlying sales growth. Image source: Unilever investor presentation. Executives didn't have much encouraging news to report on the industry's growth pace, though. Markets are still "soft and volatile," Polman said. Overall, "consumer demand remained weak and in the markets which we operate volumes have slowed further and are flat in aggregate," he explained. In an investor presentation Unilever noted that consumer confidence has declined through the year, and that slump is likely pressuring sales volumes. Looking forward The company reiterated its full-year growth target calling for roughly 4% organic growth. That seems achievable, given the gains in the first three quarters of the year. Meanwhile, investors can look for Unilever to ramp up its cost-cutting initiative over the next few quarters in a bid to boost profit margin even if overall sales remain flat. Unilever is happy with the bolt-on acquisitions it has recently made, including Dollar Shave Club, Blueair, and Seventh Generation, and thus more of these types of purchases could be on the way. As for a growth turnaround, it isn't showing up in the data yet. In fact, further slowing could be in the cards. Sales volume figures will be key to watch over the coming quarters since higher prices won't be enough to keep organic growth chugging higher. Unilever aims for "volume-driven" expansion, and that didn't happen this quarter. Still, the company is on track to hit management's broad targets of market-share growth, improved profitability, and strong cash flow even as it navigates a volatile, weakening global industry.

October 13, 2016 Updated 15:56 GMT Country Algeria Bahrain Egypt Iraq Jordan Kuwait Lebanon Libya Mauritania Morocco Oman Palestine Qatar Saudi Arabia Sudan Syria Tunisia United Arab Emirates Yemen ع media facebook twitter google plus youtube rss search Home News In-depth Comment Society Blog searchBox Homepage : Blog Breaking News Homepage : Blog : 'Marmitegate' and peace in the Middle Yeast James Brownsell 'Marmitegate' and peace in the Middle Yeast Last jar standing: The idea Marmite could bring Middle East peace failed to spread [Getty] Date of publication: 13 October, 2016 Share this page: 0 twitter Blog: The savoury spread was once touted as the recipe for an end to violence, yet reported shortages are raising blood pressures across the UK. Tags: Marmitegate, UK, food banks, Brexit, The world has gone mad. While this may once have been the rallying cry only of the world's Victor Meldrews, it is now clearly a truth to be held as self-evident. The impunity with which mass murder is carried out in Syria, in Yemen, in Iraq. The support for a dangerous clown to become president of the United States. The tightening of the police state in Egypt. The arrest of teenagers in Saudi Arabia for flirting. The deaths of David Bowie and Prince. Bob Dylan being awarded the Nobel Prize. The march of the far-right, all across Europe. The rejection of the Colombian peace deal. The Brexit vote. And now, the Great Marmite Crisis of 2016. Marmitegate. Marmageddon. Never let it be said that the Brits can blow things out of proportion. The Brits, after all, invaded China and got everyone hooked on opium just so we could get cheap tea. In case you've missed the story spreading across British media faster than a savoury treat spreads across one's toasted crumpet, it is basically this: months after the Brexit vote, the UK government has still put forward no plan for dealing with the hugely complicated legal, constitutional, financial task of extricating the country from the European Union. This causes great uncertainty in the markets. On Wednesday, the pound fell to a level last seen when Disraeli ordered the British fleet to the Dardanelles before the Crimean war. Sterling hasn't been this weak since the lightbulb was invented. As a result, Unilever, the producer of Marmite (a yeast-extract spread on toast and one of Britain's favourite breakfast, lunch and dinner ingredients), announced that, as relative costs of production were rising, it would be raising the price of its products. Unilever is one of a handful of companies (along with the likes of P&G and Nestle) that make the vast majority of everything the average Brit consumes on a daily basis. Tesco, which holds a 28 percent market share of British grocery stores, subsequently declared that it would not pay the higher prices, and would refuse to re-stock Unilever goods. Twitter Post Panic on the streets of London. It should probably be noted that, when the pound was strong, Unilever wasn't exactly dropping its prices to bargain basement levels. It did have a turnover of $58 billion in 2015. Times aren't exactly tough at Unilever House. But as one Twitterer tweeted: If Tesco behaves like this with a giant company like Unilever, then just imagine how they're treating small farmers and producers. Philip North, bishop of Burnley, also commented: "The real story here is not Tesco v Unilever, but rising food prices and impact on the poor. Let's hope the food banks are Brexit-ready." Food bank use in the UK, incidentally, has swelled from 347,000 emergency three-day supply packs being issued in 2012 to more than one million in 2015. Twitter Post But wait, I hear you cry. What does Marmite have to do with the Middle East? The link is tenuous, I'll admit. But it is this. Marmite was once proposed as a solution to the violence plaguing the region. That's right. And in a serious meeting of serious people. No less serious people than the serious people at Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office, in fact. In 1999, the professor of lateral thinking, Dr Edward de Bono, was called in to lead a series of workshops with the UK's top diplomats. Dr de Bono promotes thinking about thinking – about deconstructing problems and coming at them from alternate angles. So far, so good. But his proposal concerning Marmite and the Middle East jarred with the would-be peacemakers. It is a lack of zinc in one's diet, he claimed, that makes men irritable and prone to violence. Put aside what you may think about decades of injustice, occupation, foreign powers carving up territory or plundering resources. Think about zinc. Zinc is present in yeast, de Bono continued. And most people in the west get plenty of zinc from bread. Twitter Post But the bread of the Middle East is made without yeast. Unleavened bread. Flat bread. Pitta bread. Khubz arabee. Sure, hummus has some zinc in it, but what's a really good source of zinc, according to the good doctor? That's right. My mate, your mate, Marmite. So send a job-lot of the stuff to Tel Aviv and Ramallah and let peace reign in the Middle East. Genius. Except for one thing. I tried it out. In my years of visiting and living and working in the region, from Bethlehem to Doha, a jar of the sticky stuff was never far from my reach, and I took great delight in introducing people to the yeasty zinc-filled wonderspread. And as my extensive and not-particularly-scientific experiments have continued, one thing has become abundantly clear. "Love it or hate it" is right. Never mind the historic role of the British in Palestine, or whether sandwich shops should stay open during Ramadan, it was Marmite that was a serious cause of division between people who would be friends under most other circumstances. And it's not as if we need more of that.   James Brownsell is Managing Editor of The New Arab. Follow him on Twitter: @JamesBrownsell Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

But Paul Polman is also staunchly anti-Brexit and put his name to a letter from Unilever bosses to workers telling them the company would be damaged by a vote to leave the EU.  It left employees in no doubt where their leaders stood: 'Unilever in the UK...would...be negatively impacted if the UK were to leave the European Union. 'We therefore hope...the UK will choose to Remain and thereby continue to play a central role in Unilever's long-term growth and prosperity.'  Mr Polman, 60, has been the CEO of Unilever since January 2009. Born and brought up in the Dutch city of Enschede, his father was the executive of a tyre company while his mother was a schoolteacher who quit her job in order to raise her family. One of six children, their household was staunchly Catholic. Mr Polman spent time studying for the priesthood in a Carmelite seminary before deciding he wanted to become a doctor. However, places to study medicine were limited and he was not picked in the lottery system at the time so he instead went on to earn a BA from the University of Groningen in 1977. Two years later he gained an MA in Economics and an MBA in Finance and International Marketing at the University of Cincinnati. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next #Marmitegate!

He has said that there is an 'obscene excess in salary' handed to chief executives of businesses these days.

Brewton, a resident of Atlanta, Ga., and motivational speaker for 15 years, said she realized she wanted to do more while working in corporate America. “My first career was working as a senior HR manager for Procter and Gamble. I also volunteered by working with teen girls,” she said. “Fifteen years ago, I made a decision that it wasn’t enough for me to be successful. I wanted to be significant and became a motivational speaker.” She explained being significant and leaving the world in a better place are some of the things she talks to youth about. “When you’re successful, you add value to your own life. But when you die, you take that success with you to the grave,” Brewton said. “When you’re significant, that’s when you add value to someone else’s life.” She added there are four keys to success which is her overall message to the kids. According to Brewer, the four keys for youth are to value their education; to create a vision for their life and have a plan in place; to have an understanding that discipline is the key to success; and that they need to choose their friends wisely.

She has been a journalist for more than 25 years. At a University of New Brunswick lecture hall in Fredericton, adults had a chance to "seriously play" with Lego to create 3D models and unlock their creativity.  For one exercise they were all given the same six pieces of Lego to create a duck. When all the ducks were in a row, it was clear they're all different. "I think that when they first come in, they think this is another silly fad thing," said facilitator Jacqueline Lloyd Smith. Barb Hoyt and Jess Baker learned that having the same tools and the same direction doesn't mean you're going to get the same result. (Catherine Harrop/CBC) She also said that evaporates after the first 30 minutes. With a background in art therapy and business, Smith jumped on this method.  She became an official Lego trainer and has been flying around the world with the colourful blocks. She admits her company's Lego collection is massive.  "We have to rent storage," said Smith. Thinking differently The groups who've used this technique vary from a city strategizing about crime fighting, to Procter & Gamble, to the United Nations.  "We were able to make the point, at the United Nations, that we need to hear from everyone and we need everyone thinking differently if we're going to move forward and solve the problems of the world," said Smith. Everyone at the lecture as asked to create a duck out of the same six Lego pieces. (Catherine Harrop/CBC) The next instruction to the group was to build a tower. Like a seemingly straight forward office memo, it sent people in very different directions. "When we were told to build a tower, I thought of height first," said participant Seth Giberson. The majority went for stability. The University of New Brunswick sponsored the public night, and will be using the method with its own extended learning department to help them assemble a strategic plan.  Smith said it's the only type of strategic planning session where participants have passed on a coffee break. A new way to strategize Groups who’ve used this technique vary from a city strategizing about crime fighting, to Procter & Gamble, to the United Nations. (Catherine Harrop/CBC) The idea of using Lego to visualize problems was born of collaboration in 1996 among two business professors in Switzerland. Johan Roos and Bart Victor joined up with Lego Group owner Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, according to the Lego website. They were looking for new ways of visualizing and solving business problems. By 2004, Lego took it over, and eventually developed a community based model, giving groups a new way of strategizing, and giving Lego a new revenue stream.

The campaign, executed on behalf of Revlon, marks the beginning of an exclusive, strategic South African partnership between MediaCom’s content division, MediaCom Beyond Advertising (MBA), and indaHash. Due to the fact that indaHash will be exclusively distributed through MediaCom in South Africa, all agencies and advertisers have the opportunity to utilise this unique technology through the MBA division. Following successful launches in countries such as Poland, Germany and the UK, South Africa will be another market that will benefit from indaHash’s unique ability to automate collaboration between brands and digital influencers. With an international platform that is fully automated, indaHash revolutionises the process of collaboration between brands and digital influencers. It was established at the beginning of 2016 and has since gathered over 65 000 influencers, steadily captured new markets, and executed more than 200 campaigns for some of the world’s biggest brands, such as Coca-Cola, P&G, McDonald’s, and L’Oreal. A ground-breaking digital partnership As a new strategic partner of MediaCom, one of the largest content and media agencies worldwide, indaHash will be made available to all MediaCom clients, as well as other agencies in South Africa that wish to use the platform for their own client campaigns. Federico Dedeu, Head of MediaCom Beyond Advertising – which is the MediaCom division that will be working with indaHash the most frequently – says that the company is very excited to be partnering with indaHash, as it’s going to revolutionise the way brands are able to work with influencers. “We have been consistently seeing the true value of this marketing method,” continues Mr. Dedeu. “The technology enables brands to easily work with 1 or 100 influencers at a time, as it manages the contracts and the different payment models. This means that budgets can work harder than ever before. Over and above this, brands retain the rights to the assets created by the influencers, which have real production cost savings.” Setting the momentum for great digital moments Joanna Pawluk, Managing Partner at indaHash, says that in the case of South Africa, indaHash decided to enter the market with a different business model. “Instead of building a local team,” Ms. Pawluk explains, “we decided on a strategic partnership with MediaCom. As indaHash, we are delivering the technology on a daily basis that is used successfully by some of the biggest agencies and media houses worldwide. We are happy that, together with MediaCom, we will now be able to deliver the best campaigns involving influencers in South Africa.” The first campaign in South Africa will involve the marketing of Revlon’s Great Moments competition. The influencers were asked, through the indaHash app, to select one of the prize holidays, take a photo of the indispensable items they would take along for an expedition, and add Revlon deodorant to the picture. Additionally, influencers will tell their followers about the competition and encourage them to participate. The competition runs until October 31st. For indaHash, Joanna Pawluk will be responsible for the development and launch of the platform in the South African market, while Mediacom Beyond Advertising will be represented by Federico Dedeu.

Her breadth of experiences has led to her invitation to join Forbes Agency Council. Ann Arbor, MI, October 12, 2016 --(PR.com)-- Ida Abdalkhani, Founder & Chief Catalyzer at Ability to Engage, a boutique consultancy that specializes in brand building, marketing, innovation and consumer research, has been accepted into the Forbes Agency Council, an invitation-only community for executives in successful public relations, media strategy, creative and advertising agencies. Ability to Engage was hand-selected as one of the first members of this special community. In recent years, Ability to Engage has grown over 300% and works across the globe with some of the world’s largest and most respected companies in brand and marketing such as Clorox, ConAgra Foods, McGraw Hill, PepsiCo, Pfizer, and Procter & Gamble, as well as start-ups, non-profits, universities, and government groups. Ida’s dedication to the pursuit of curiosity and the power within every individual for innovation has made her a sought after speaker at local, regional and national events. Scott Gerber, founder of Forbes Councils, says, “We are honored to welcome Ida Abdalkhani into the community. Our mission with Forbes Councils is to curate successful professionals from every industry, creating a vetted, social capital-driven network that helps every member make an even greater impact on the business world.” Ida grew up in the small, Midwestern, town of Lima, Ohio. She went on to become a Buckeye, holding an MBA, BSBA, and BA from The Ohio State University. While growing up in Lima, Ida’s natural creativity, leadership, and sense of entrepreneurship started to take form. While still in elementary school, she and a friend developed a newspaper, The 4th Grade Times and she went door-to-door with a neighborhood friend selling handmade jewelry. During high school, Ida started “Help Your Community Day,” bringing classmates, teachers, and administrators together to volunteer in the community once-a-month. Ida’s curiosity only grew when she went to college. She was the President of Ohio State’s student-run entrepreneurship group an went on to declare entrepreneurship as one of her majors. However, after graduation, she did not become an entrepreneur. Ida interned at The Coca-Cola Company and Procter & Gamble and found she loved the world of marketing and brand. She went on to become a global brand manager at P&G. However, Ida felt a need for more opportunities to discover and create. She resigned from her job and went backpacking around the world - visiting approximately 50 countries over 8 months! During her travels, Ida realized that traditional consumer insight methods and related marketing were only scratching the surface of what was possible to connect with audiences on a deeper level. Ida started developing methods for deeper insights and innovation when she returned from her travels, and the journey creating Ability to Engage began. “People will always be at the core of what I do. I am driven by helping people better understand themselves, and the world around them. It’s what motivates me to continue digging deep and innovating through Ability to Engage.” Contact Information Ability to Engage Sandra Saavedra 657-464-4320 Contact www.AbilityToEngage.com Click here to view the list of recent Press Releases from Ability to Engage Promote Your Business Affiliate Program Link To Us Email this page to a friend PR.com Contact Us About Us Terms of Use Help

His company – Patanjali Ayurved Ltd. – raked in a whopping INR 5000 crore in revenue in 2015-16 and is on its way to double that next year, giving global industry giants like Unilever, P&G and ColgatePalmolive a run for their money. This growth story appears all the more eye-popping when one takes into consideration the fact that Patanjali scaled these dizzying heights by swearing off the marketing rulebook. Minus erudite honchos, market research and big stars endorsing its products, to find out how the high priest of yoga doubled as a savvy purveyor of a wide array of consumer goods, read on… View photos Success by serendipity It all started circa 2004. The story goes like this: In a bid to help farmers struggling to offload their produce like gooseberries (amla in Hindi) and aloe vera, Ramdev started buying from them at a fair price. The breakout sales of its amla juice product soon resulted in Patanjali’s profits soaring. Encouraged, Ramdev, along with the company’s co-founder Acharya Balkrishna, started launching products left and right. Today, Patanjali, Divya Pharmacy (the Ayurvedic medicine manufacturing company set up in 1995) and Patanjali Gram Udyoga Unit produce close to 800 products ranging from dairy and beauty products to textile, noodles, cornflakes and cookies. View photos Organic Growth Overall Companies that make it big in a short while, mostly do so by swallowing smaller companies, or merging with competitors, or both. The process is called inorganic growth. But in case of Patanjali, it grew all on its own, i.e. organically, by upping profits through product development and increasing its customer base. Patanjali launched every conceivable product it anticipated would have demand at ultra-competitive prices for the mass market. And it clicked!  What was established in 2006 as a cottage industry grew to become a force in the FMCGs sector. View photos Acharya Balkrishna: An Unusual Billionaire Though Ramdev is the poster boy for Patanjali, he does not own any share in the company, since he is a self-proclaimed Hindu ascetic. It is his childhood friend, close associate and co-founder of Patanjali, Acharya Balkrishna, who owns 97 percent stake in Patanjali Ayurved Ltd. He has even featured in Forbes magazine’s rich list in India this year at the 48th position. His net worth was pegged at US $2.5 billion. Interestingly, Balkrishna does not draw a salary and devotes 15 hours every day to the company without taking a single day off. Read More The remaining shares in the company are held by Sarwan ‘Sam’ Poddar and his wife Sunita, both residents of Scotland. View photos Offbeat Marketing Strategy Patanjali steered clear of multi-million marketing strategies of big corporate houses. Instead, it relied on old-school methods like word-of-mouth to popularise the product initially.  It helped, of course, that that Ramdev pitched the initial products to the multitudes that throng his yoga camps across the country and the millions that follow him on television. Further, unlike corporate giants, Patanjali just launched a flurry of products – sometimes even simultaneously – without any market research. Ramdev and his lieutenants just went ahead with their gut instinct, which paid off. Two of its unique selling points are chemical-free products and dirt-cheap prices. The latter is achieved by buying raw materials directly from farmers without middlemen. Patanjali started advertising its products after a point in time though, but no celebrity has been roped in. Instead, it’s Ramdev who is at the centre of these ads. Swadeshi (Indian made) is the buzzword and it has caught the popular public imagination. The current BJP government’s campaign on ‘Make in India’ is also helping Patanjali position itself at the forefront of this movement, further helping its sales. Till 2011, Patanjali products were sold through exclusive franchise stores and health centres where free ayurvedic consultation was provided. Post that, it started retail outlets resulting in multiplied sales and compounded profits. View photos Goods Galore An estimated 800 products today come under brand Patanjali. While listing all is not possible, some of the runaway hits are definitely worth a mention. Clarified butter (ghee), for example, is the top revenue generator. Next in popularity are toothpaste and hairoil/shampoo. In fact, Patanjali’s toothpaste Dant Kanti has almost knocked the breath out of a Goliath in the FMCG sector – Colgate. To regain its lost market share, Colgate is being forced to launch a toothpaste this quarter using all-natural ingredients. Besides, there have been products that don’t quite tally with the brand’s image like instant noodles, and beauty products. But Ramdev claims they all have a swadeshi twist, something that sets them apart. Patanjali now plans to expand further into other mass markets such as apparel – with the launch of denim jeans – and baby care products. View photos False Claims? However, it seems that not all of the yoga guru’s claims about his company are true. Patanjali outsources manufacturing of certain products, which is contrary to Ramdev’s assertion that everything is manufactured in-house. Biscuits, for example, are made by Delhi-based Sona Biscuits that also purveys biscuits under Sobisco brand. The aloe vera unit, reported an English newspaper, uses pulp supplied by Dhandev Resorts and Health Care Pvt. Ltd, a Jaisalmer-based company owned by a Congress politician, for aloe vera juice. This is against statements that the company uses produce from its own aloe vera plantations. Over 200 scientists, who research and develop Patanjali products at the company’s Haridwar headquarters, are forbidden from interacting with outsiders. Security is also tight, with Central Industrial Security Forces (CISF) jawans deployed at the manufacturing unit in Haridwar, and media being denied access to several parts of the campus. Work Culture at Patanjali Unlike its competitors, Patanjali does not recruit from B-schools. It procures talent from its network, or by advertising. And so far it has created direct and indirect employment for around 15,000 people. Payscales are not on par with others, though. And most join the company driven by some voluntary zeal. But, notably, Patanjali Ayurved boasts of a gender diversity ratio of 30:70. The work culture at Patanjali is unique too, in keeping with the image of the brand. Instead of the staple corporate world greetings, people are greeted with 'Om’ there. Smoking, drinking and eating meat are prohibited. Future Plans Emboldened by the phenomenal success and flush with funds, Ramdev’s immediate plans are to achieve a turnover of ₹10,000 crore! For that, the company needs to add to its manufacturing capacity. Its Haridwar campus – an industrial zone named Padartha – already has 28 factories, and research and development facilities. Ramdev and his team now plan to set up food and herbal parks in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Assam and even Nepal as a next step. View photos Imitators Inspired by the roaring success of Patanjali, a couple of other self-styled godmen too have forayed into business with ayurveda-based products. Sri Sri Ravishankar, founder of Art of Living, has launched consumer goods under the brand name of Sri Sri Ayurveda. Again, Gurmeet Ram Rahim, the Dera chief popularly referred to as Rockstar baba, has founded a company promoting organic products. None, so far, have tasted success anywhere close to what Baba Ramdev has.

Conway G. Gittens reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Alibaba works its magic on the first day of going public, but the pizzazz is largely contained to its stock alone. The Dow crept up to another record closing high, but the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were down for the day. For the week: The Dow gained 1.7 percent and the Nasdaq was flat. Alibaba shares surged to nearly $100 in their opening day after the Chinese e-commerce company successfully completed the world's biggest IPO ever. Closing the day with a market cap of more than $231 billion, Alibaba is more valuable than well-known international brands like JP Morgan Chase, Procter and Gamble and Coca-Cola. Morris Mark of Mark Asset Management owns tech stocks like Yahoo and says Alibaba is a great company. SOUNDBITE: MORRIS MARK, FOUNDER, MARK ASSET MANAGEMENT (ENGLISH) SAYING: "This is really a good company. It really has established a fabulous franchise in the world's largest and fastest growing Internet market, in a country that's underserved by physical infrastructure." Shares of Alibaba ended with a 38 percent gain, below that century price. But Yahoo, which sold 8 billion dollars worth of its stake in Alibaba, gave up all gains to end the session lower. Chinese Internet company Baidu - another tech loser - as Alibaba gets the cash to grow even bigger. The other big story of the day: Apple. A mob scene at Apple stores around the world. The masses flocked to buy the iPhone 6 and the larger screen 6 plus. Both devices are aimed at catching up to rival Samsung, which until recently had much success with larger screen smartphones. Analysts expect opening weekend sales to range between 8 to 12 million handsets. Shares of Apple finished the session nearly down a full percent. Oracle shares slumping one day after the surprise departure of Larry Ellison as CEO, but stay on as executive chairman. It's not the kind of big you want to be. Home Depot admits to the biggest credit card security breach in retail history. 56 million or so credit and debit cards were compromised, eclipsing the 40 million compromised at Target. Home Depot says the tab so far is estimated to be $62 million. Shares of the home improvement retailer end the day higher. In Europe - sighs of relief as the United Kingdom avoids being broken up by Scottish voters. But the market did not have much energy and finished the day flat.

Watch: 'Aftab!' duck to quack on local TV Politics Extra Jason Williams , jwilliams@enquirer.com 8:54 p.m. EDT October 11, 2016 540 Shares Aftab Pureval's political ad  (Photo: Provided) Get used to hearing the Aflac duck quacking all over local television again. Well, actually it'll be quacking "Aftab!" – promoting rookie candidate Aftab Pureval for Hamilton County Clerk of Courts. The Democrat's spot hits airwaves on Wednesday, the start of an all-out ad blitz on local TV leading up to the Nov. 8 election. Pureval has reserved nearly $125,000 in ad time on Cincinnati's FOX, CBS, NBC and ABC affiliates, according to federal records. That's a lot of money to spend on advertising for a clerk of courts race, but Pureval is aggressively trying to gain recognition. The Procter & Gamble attorney is the underdog in a race against big-name Republican incumbent Tracy Winkler. The blitz will start with a 30-second spot featuring a yellow duck puppet quacking "Aftab!" as the candidate addresses a group of people. It's a play off the Aflac commercials that debuted in the early 2000s. Couch potatoes nationwide came to know the insurance company quite well for its duck mascot loudly quacking "Aflac!" It led to people quacking "Aflac!" in offices, schools and around the house. Pureval hopes his ad helps his name stick in the minds of voters. "I know Aftab is a unique name," Pureval told Politics Extra last summer. "I'll speak to groups and months later, someone will come up and say, 'I don't remember everything you said, but I do know you're the Aflac guy.' I'm running on serious issues about how to reform our courts, but if thinking of that duck helps people remember my name, then people can quack 'Aftab' at me all over Hamilton County." Pureval is the second local candidate to spoof a nationally recognized name. Hamilton County commissioner candidate Andrew Pappas spoofed 1980s TV hit series "Knight Rider" with "The Pappas Mobile" in June. New York Post and Cleveland Plain Dealer reporters thought the ad was campy enough to mention it, and "The Pappas Mobile" has been viewed nearly 8,200 times on YouTube.

But the two millionaire men behind 'Marmitegate' are no strangers to each other.  They are both very familiar with the workings of Unilever, having both worked at the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods company for a combined total of almost 35 years. After more than 27 years at the £2billion firm, Dave Lewis, 51, moved over to Tesco to take up his current role as chief executive, while Paul Polman, 60, filled the vacant spot as CEO at Unilever in 2009. Yesterday, they spent the day negotiating the terms of a 10 per cent price hike which Unilever wanted to impose on supermarkets, blaming a post-Brexit era. The tumultuous day ended with Tesco coming out on top after it landed a 'satisfactory' response when Unilever backed down following a threat to boycott. Here, we put the two firms' top bosses and their successful careers head-to-head. Paul Polman, 60, chief executive of Unilever Paul Polman, 60, chief executive of Unilever Pay: £9.3million Company: Makes brands including Marmite and Colman's Mustard. Profits of £6.5billion with 2billion people in 190 countries using its products every day. Family: Married to Kim Polman, with three children. Background: Born and raised in Enschede, Netherlands, with three brothers and two sisters. Father was a tyre company executive and his mother was a teacher. Graduated from the University of Groningen with a BA, before gaining an MA in economics and an MBA in finance and international marketing at the University of Cincinnati. Career history: Held top jobs at rivals Procter & Gamble and Nestle before joining Unilever in 2009. Won a number of awards for charity work and conservation, and is president of a charity for blind African children. What he said on Brexit: Mr Polman signed the infamous letter of 200 bosses who backed Remain. He, along with former chief executives Patrick Cescau and Niall FitzGerald and ex-chairman Sir Michael Perry also sent a joint letter to employees, saying: 'We therefore hope that in the interests of Unilever, the UK, Europe, and indeed the wider global economy, the UK will choose to Remain.' Warned of 'serious consequences' of Brexit, saying price of products like Wall's Magnum ice cream would rise. 'Undoubtedly if the UK were to Leave, the conditions will not be as good as if they stay in,' he said. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next The great Marmite scam: Shame on Unilever for exploiting...

Simone Biles headlines Indy gymnastics event this weekend David Woods , david.woods@indystar.com 5:51 p.m. EDT October 13, 2016 Buy Photo FILE – Simone Biles beams after dismounting the balance beam during the P&G Championships at Bankers Life Fieldhouse, Aug. 15, 2015. (Photo: Kelly Wilkinson / IndyStar)Buy Photo Story Highlights Kellogg’s Tour of Gymnastics Champions, 7 p.m., Saturday, Bankers Life Fieldhouse Simone Biles could be the poster child for multiple causes or issues. Among them, as it turns out, is Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Hackers who broke into the database of the World Anti-Doping Agency revealed last month that the gymnast was approved for a therapeutic use exemption (TUE) for ADHD medication. There was nothing extraordinary in that. Nor did Biles violate any doping regulations. Taking such medicine “is nothing to be ashamed of, nothing that I’m afraid to let people know,” Biles posted on Twitter. In another post, she said she has taken such medicine since she was a child and that she has “always followed the rules.” The 19-year-old Biles, coming off four gold medals at the Rio Olympics, is the megastar of the Kellogg’s Tour of Gymnastics Champions that includes Saturday’s 7 p.m. show at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. To promote the tour, she agreed to a recent phone interview with IndyStar. Conditions of the interview were that she not answer questions about ADHD or about the IndyStar investigation into USA Gymnastics’ handling of cases alleging sexual abuse. Having ADHD, and taking medicine for it is nothing to be ashamed of nothing that I'm afraid to let people know.— Simone Biles (@Simone_Biles) September 13, 2016 Diagnoses of ADHD have increased significantly in recent years. According to the American Psychiatric Association, about 5 percent of American children have ADHD. The condition is not unusual among athletes. Michael Phelps was diagnosed with it, as was baseball slugger Kyle Schwarber. Perhaps Biles will elaborate in her autobiography, “Courage to Soar,” written with author Michelle Buford. The book is to be released Nov. 15. Biles said she was motivated to tell her own story rather than people reading about her on the Internet. “Words can get twisted,” she said. “I just want them to hear it from me.” Buy Photo FILE – Simone Biles performs moves in a floor exercise during a practice session for the P&G Gymnastics Championships at Bankers Life Fieldhouse, Aug.12, 2015.  (Photo: Kelly Wilkinson / IndyStar) Her post-Rio lifestyle has been dizzying. She said after the last gymnastics event there, the gymnasts packed and left immediately for “media stuff.” She did not witness any other sports. She claimed to be the klutz of the “Final Five” – members of the final national team assembled by Martha Karolyi – in pin trading. “I swear, it’s like another Olympic sport,” Biles said. “They’re just so quick and fast. They all get to everybody before me.” She said she did meet Usain Bolt in the dining hall. Upon returning to America, she met celebrities such as Beyonce, Kim Kardashian and Usher, and she filmed a music video with Jake Miller. The Final Five had what was essentially a private audience with President Obama on the Olympians' visit to the White House. Biles often awakens not knowing where she is in during the 36-city tour that opened Sept. 15 and continues through Nov. 13. The troupe is in Chicago and Milwaukee on the two nights before Indianapolis and in Grand Rapids, Mich., on Sunday. INDIANAPOLIS STAR Simone Biles wins third straight gymnasitcs all-around title She competed in Indy 14 months ago in the P&G Championships, her final U.S. competition before the Olympic year. She said she doesn’t “remember too much” from that because all the meets pass so quickly. Biles became the first gymnast ever to sweep major all-around titles in an Olympic quadrennium: three world championships and the Olympic gold medal. Surprisingly, she said the worlds were “more nerve-wracking to me than the Olympics.” The Americans were so prepared for Rio, she said, that it felt like another meet.

By Roger Baird October 13, 2016 18:40 BST From left: Tesco CEO Dave Lewis, Unilever CEO Paul Polman were fighting for control of the prices of household brandsReuters Marmite-maker Unilever said its stalemate with the country's biggest supermarket Tesco has now been settled. The country's largest grocery manufacturer said: "Unilever is pleased to confirm that the supply situation with Tesco in the UK and Ireland has now been successfully resolved." The two firms had rowed over price and the logjam this week led to household staples such as Marmite, PG Tips tea and Dove soap disappearing from supermarket shelves. Unilever said: "We have been working together closely to reach this resolution and ensure our much-loved brands are once again fully available. For all those that missed us, thanks for all the love." However, details of their agreement were not released. The row blew up when Anglo-Dutch household goods giant Unilever is understood to have raised wholesale prices by 10% for supermarket Tesco to cover the rising costs of goods made aboard since June's Brexit vote, which has seen the pound fall almost 18%. But Tesco, which has a 28% share of the UK grocery market, has refused to pay, resulting in Unilever ending supplies of hundreds of its brands to the supermarket. The supermarket began to remove scarce items from its website earlier this week – such as Ben & Jerry's ice-cream and Marmite – and it is now leaving empty spaces on its shelves. A Tesco spokesperson had said the group was "currently experiencing availability issues". Unilever chief financial officer Graeme Pitkethly said yesterday (12 October) the group was lifting wholesale prices in Britain. He said: "In the UK, which accounts for 5% of turnover, prices should start to increase to cover the cost of imported goods due to weaker sterling." He said he was confident that the dispute with Tesco will be "resolved very quickly", adding that other Unilever customers have already accepted the price rises. Other UK supermarkets remain quiet on this issue. Pitkethly spoke as the global group posted its third quarter sales, which saw underlying sales rise 3.2% in the period, with total sales hitting €13.4bn (£12.bn, $14.8bn). MPs condemn Unilever over excuse MPs condemned Unilever, saying the company was using Brexit as an excuse to exploit consumers, and warned it may be damaging its brand. Conservative MP, and Leave campaigner, Sir Gerald Howarth said it will be very damaging to the firm's reputation "if they seek to use the fall in the pound to exploit the consumer". A jar of Marmite, one of the Unilever products which has been removed from Tesco's website amid price disputeBen Stansall/ AFP However, Unilever chief executive Paul Polman warned back in June that a vote to leave the EU's single market would increase prices for consumers. He said a hard Bexit would mean hikes in import duties on items such as dairy products, leading to price rises that would affect consumers. But last week Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis signalled he was limbering up for a fight with suppliers who tried to use the falling pound to drive through price increases. Lewis said many suppliers failed to pass on currency benefits to consumers when sterling was on the way up, and that he was "uncomfortable" with efforts to raise prices on the way down. Lewis, 51, is well-placed to know how Unilever is likely to react, because the Yorkshireman worked at the manufacturer for almost three decades until he took the helm at Tesco in 2014. He worked across a range of food and beauty units, and picked up the moniker 'Drastic' Dave along the way, as he became known as a ruthless cost-cutter. At Tesco he restored the supermarket giant to full-year £162m pre-tax profit this year after it had posted one of the biggest losses in UK corporate history, sending it £6.4bn into the red in 2015. Lewis did this by selling off a range foreign and non-core units and focusing on the key UK business. Unilever's green Dutchman Polman, 60, worked at some of the largest firms on the globe – America's P&G and Switzerland's Nestle – before the Dutchman took the helm at Unilever in 2009. One of his first acts was to cut full reporting to the stock market every quarter to encourage a long-term perspective. Under him the company pledged to eliminate coal from its energy usage within five years, and derive all of its energy solely from renewable sources by 2030. But he has kept a firm eye on the bottom line. The business saw pre-tax profits slip 8% to €7.2bn last year, but the group's total shareholder return during Polman's time in the hot seat has risen by 203%, above most of its peers. A collision of a number of factors led the two largest firms in UK food manufacture and retailing to publicly square up to each other. The major supermarkets – Sainsbury's, Tesco, Asda and Morrisons – have been locked in a fierce price war with discounters such as Aldi and Lidl for the last four years. The battle has seen grocers cut prices to win market share, which in turn gives them greater pricing power when they negotiate with suppliers. Brexit effect The rise of discounters and largely stagnant household budgets since the financial crisis has seen shoppers increasingly prepared to use own-label brands, over household brands. Finally, the plunge in the value of sterling since Brexit, as long-term investors wait for signs of the UK's new global trading arrangements, is the final element in this cocktail. Unilever's Ben & Jerry's ice-cream is one of a number of products at short supply at TescoReuters Liberal Democrats leader Tim Farron said in a column for IBTimes UK: "The row between Unilever and Tesco is the first sign that the huge and damaging costs of Brexit are beginning to feed through to the real economy." Petrol could be the next sector where Brexit hits the real economy. Chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association Brian Madderson warned earlier this week that motorists could expect increases of up to 5p per litre by the end of the month, unless there are favourable corrections to exchange rates or oil prices. Two gorillas fight it out The war of words that Tesco and Unilever were engaged in was symbolic of changes that are happening across the high street, said Bruno Monteyne, an analyst at Bernstein. Monteyne said: "This isn't about Tesco or Unilever but about all UK retailers and suppliers." Hargreaves Lansdown senior analyst Laith Khalaf added: "This pricing spat is likely to be the thin end of the wedge when it comes to relationships between UK retailers and their suppliers, in light of the pressures now applied by weaker sterling." "It also doesn't bode too well for consumers, who may soon face higher prices if retailers can't entirely defray the higher costs of imports." The details of stand-offs like this often involve a three-way compromise where margins are sliced at manufacturers and retailers and higher prices are passed on to customers. This move will feed into fears that Brexit will see a range of prices drift higher until the UK arrives at more settled trading arrangements.

The company will use the capital to strengthen its technology infrastructure and team. It will also expand its services to more cities across the country, Mansi Zaveri, founder and chief executive of Kidsstoppress, told Techcircle. Launched in 2011, Kidsstoppress (KSP), owned and operated by Kidsstoppress Media Pvt Ltd, connects parents to brands, services, and events for children through its online platform. Currently, it offers its services across Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad and Pune. In addition to the website, it manages a host of properties such as KSP Code, a loyalty and exclusive access card for parents to buy kids products and services from its partnering brands; KSP Awards, a popular choice awards for brands and services in the parenting and baby care segment; KSP Kids Book Club; KSP TV, a platform that discusses topics of relevance to parents and KSP Radio, a digital radio station that shares bite size news for kids. “The parenting and baby care segment in India is a very large opportunity and is worth close to $25 billion. At the same time, it is also fragmented and very local in terms of language, culture and geography. At Kidsstoppress.com, we have built the groundwork to address this large opportunity across segments including content and market place,” Zaveri said. She said the startup is also running a beta trial of a curated marketplace model for parenting and kid products, helping parents discover products on the Kidsstoppress platform. “Kidsstoppress is working on a number of new initiatives including a curated market place model and strengthening the technology backbone to provide a very personalised experience to the parents,” Zaveri said. The delivery of the products discovered on the platform will be managed by the marketplaces they are sourced from. Apart from the commission it plans to charge for the upcoming curated marketplace services, Zaveri said the startup enjoys a host of other revenue streams including advertising, engagement and subscription.

The maker of Magnum ice cream and Dove shampoo posted third-quarter sales growth on an underlying basis--which strips out the impact of acquisitions, disposals and exchange-rate changes--of 3.2%, down from 5.7% growth in the same period a year earlier. Revenue climbed 3.4% at constant currency as the company offset volume declines with higher prices. But including a negative currency impact of 3.4%, revenue was flat at EUR13.4 billion ($14.8 billion). Profit figures weren't disclosed. The results come as the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant has been grappling with a slump in the pound following Britain's vote to leave the European Union. Unilever's products were unavailable on British grocer Tesco PLC's website as of Wednesday after Unilever demanded Tesco raise prices and the grocer refused, according to a person familiar with the standoff. Unilever Chief Executive Paul Polman described global markets as "soft and volatile," calling out currency devaluation in Latin America as having squeezed disposable income. Unilever has adopted so-called "zero-base budgeting" or justifying each year's expenses from scratch to rein in costs as it works to mitigate the impact of a turbulent macroeconomic environment. On an underlying basis, Unilever reported sales growth in emerging markets weakened to 5.6% from 8.4% a year earlier. In developed markets, underlying sales growth was flat compared with 2.1% rise a year earlier. The company has made a string of U.S.-focused acquisitions in recent months that pit it squarely against rival Procter & Gamble. Last month it agreed to buy Seventh Generation Inc., a maker of plant-based detergents and household cleaners, and in July it said it was buying Dollar Shave Club, an e-commerce business that sells disposable razors and other grooming products. Unilever has also been pushing deeper into personal-care products such as shampoos and deodorants that appeal globally, and away from slower-growing food brands. But on Thursday the company said "intense competition" in many of its markets had squeezed growth in its personal-care arm. Revenue climbed 3.1% on an underlying basis, which is half the growth level reported a year earlier. The home-care and refreshments divisions performed better, logging underlying sales growth of 3.9% and 4.5% respectively. The food arm reported 1.7% growth, helped by cooking products in emerging markets and organic dressings. But Unilever's spreads business--which mainly consists of margarine--continued to decline in both North America and Europe.

Oct 13th 2016, 9:00 AM 18,349 Views 29 Comments Share15 Tweet Email EIGHT WEEKS HAVE passed since that, heartbreaking, almost unspeakable, day in Rio. Life has moved on, but even time is acting as a slow healer for Katie Taylor as she comes to terms with it all; the disappointment, the dejection, the reality that three of the titles she held for so long are no longer in her possession. Taylor shows her emotion after defeat in Rio. Source: INPHO/Dan Sheridan It has been a tough year. Taylor’s aura of invincibility has been pierced by the unfathomable loss of form which has seen her suffer three defeats. European, World and Olympic gold all slipped out of her grasp in the space of five months. Digesting that fact cannot be easy to swallow, particularly as the hard questions need to be asked and there is a growing consensus that her powers, now that she’s hit 30, are on the wane. But Taylor is, as her CV will remind us, a champion. No matter how big, or unexpected, the fall, champions will always find a way back. “That’s life,” she tells The42. “I took a few weeks off for a nice family holiday, a quiet time to reflect. “There’s no joy in losing fights and I think everyone knows how much the Olympic Games mean to me. I had to reflect on what happened. The emotion of the whole year really.” All those emotions poured out during the heart-wrenching interview she gave to RTÉ in the immediate aftermath of her defeat to Finnish veteran Mira Potkonen. The anguish was written all over her face, a tearful Taylor barely able to find the words to describe her third defeat of what turned out to be a turbulent, and nightmarish, year. Taylor vowed to come back stronger after the Olympics and has returned to training. Source: INPHO/Dan Sheridan Even now, she can’t quite describe what happened. It’s not that she doesn’t care to think about it but the Bray native can’t bring herself to relive it. “I haven’t actually watched the fight back no,” Taylor continues. “I don’t really want to. I don’t think I’ll watch that one back. I don’t think I’ll ever watch it back to be honest. It’s such a big competition for me so the disappointment will live with me for the rest of my life. “I would look at my own performance rather than the performance of the judges as well. I shouldn’t have made the fight so close in the first place, although the judging was very corrupt over there and everyone knows that.” Upon her return from Rio, Taylor was heartened by the support of her local community and found solace in her strong religious faith during those days of doubt. After a difficult summer, there was always a light at the end of it all. “It’s not the end of the world,” she admits. “I’ve just had to pick myself back up and get on with it really. I was really encouraged by the letters of support I received. They really lifted me. “There’s nothing you can do about what happened and you just have to be positive about the situation. I was in America for a few weeks training and it went really well. I have to concentrate on what’s next.” At the moment, the next challenge comes in the form of the EUBC European Championships in Sofia next month; although whether she competes in Bulgaria remains uncertain. Katie Taylor visited Scoil Iosef Naofa in Corville, Roscrea yesterday as part of P&G’s Thank You Mum campaign. Source: Brian Gavin A decision needs to be made, or at least announced, on her future as Taylor contemplates the option of turning professional for the last years of a glittering career. The lure of the pro-ranks has previously led her to suggest it was most likely after Rio but it remains to be seen whether she will commit to another Olympic cycle or not. “I’m just weighing up all my options at the moment and I’m considering the pro game as well,” Taylor explained. “I haven’t made any decision as of yet but I’m definitely looking at every avenue. I’m speaking to a few promoters as well but I’m in no rush, I’m taking my time because it’s obviously a huge decision for me. “The pro-game is an option at the moment but I do love the Olympic Games. As I said, I am weighing up everything.” Many of her Olympic team-mates, including Michael Conlan and Paddy Barnes, have already jumped ship but you get the sense that Taylor is also eager to set the record straight and not walk away on these terms. “It’s been a disappointing year but I hope people don’t think I’m on the way down, the best is definitely yet to come from me whether that’s in the pro game or amateur game. “The fights I have lost this year were very questionable as well so I do feel like I’m the best female boxer in the world. I feel like I can be on top for the next few years and I am very, very motivated anyway. “What happened doesn’t define who I am. The best is yet to come.” The42 is on Snapchat!

Paris brings a wealth of experience to the board at KonaRed, having spent a total of 12 years at POM Wonderful as a General Manager, VP and a four-month stint as Interim CFO/COO last year. He departed to join Harmless Harvest as COO in September, 2015, before leaving for his current position as COO of meal replacement company Soylent. “Brad Paris has substantial experience with market expansion, operations and the development and launch of new products,” Roberts said in a press release. “His advice and counsel to the board will be invaluable, and it is at a perfect time for us to add Brad to our team.” Redfield, also previously a General Manager (Industrial Sales) at POM Wonderful from 2011 through 2015, has served as President and COO at KonaRed since June 2015. “The appointment of Kyle Redfield as a director is a well deserved acknowledgement of the significant contribution he’s made to KonaRed in a short period of time, Roberts said. “Kyle’s been a driving force in our strategic initiatives and his participation as a director will further strengthen our Board.” KonaRed launched its RTD cold brew coffee line in January. Last month, KonaRed added two new SKUs — Kauai Caramel and Maui Mocha — and a 32 oz. glass bottle for Original and Hawaiian Vanilla flavors. The brand also announced a increase in retail placements and expanded distribution in August.

Prior to joining Red Bull, Olkiewicz served as a Team Lead at Cadbury and an Account Executive at Procter & Gamble. “Craig has the vision, experience, and leadership acumen to strengthen our market position and capitalize on our many growth opportunities,” said Steve Dollase, CEO of WANU, in a press release. Jennifer Berliner, ZÜPA NOMA Jennifer Berliner Heads Up Marketing At ZÜPA NOMA Jennifer Berliner has joined high pressure processed bottled soup brand ZÜPA NOMA as director of marketing. Launched in June, ZÜPA NOMA is the first company under Sonoma Brands, the product incubator and venture fund founded by Jon Sebastiani, the founder and former CEO of Krave Pure Foods, Inc. Berlinger arrives from PepsiCo, where she most recently served as Senior Brand Manager for Shopper Marketing for LiptonTea, Hydration and Frito-Lay multipack snack lines. A Yale School of Management graduate, Berlinger had served several roles at Pepsi since 2012, including Brand Manager of Flavored CSDs and Associate Brand Manager for Foodservice Innovation. “Jennifer brings an arsenal of knowledge and experience to ZÜPA NOMA, and we know that she will contribute immensely to the exponential growth of the brand as a market leader in the category,” said Sebastiani in a press release. “Our investment in a Marketing division at ZÜPA NOMA, led by Jennifer, marks a valuable addition to our team as we continue to make an impact on the soup category with innovation and creativity.” More Moves at Veggemo Having recently brought on Frank Hood as VP of U.S. Business Development, the Global Gardens Group, owners of veggie-based non-dairy beverage brand Veggemo, announced the appointment of Paul Sun to its Board of Directors.

Reprints Reprints Most Popular Intel has a new explanation for the famous scowling "Phelps face" from last summer's Olympics – inadequate processing power. That's the basis for a new series of ads pairing the world's fastest swimmer with the world's slowest computer, and with Jim Parsons of "Big Bang Theory" and Intel fame. Mr. Phelps' scowl was originally captured on camera as his rival Chad le Clos of South Africa warmed up by shadow boxing in an apparent effort to distract or intimidate him before August's 200-meter butterfly competition in Rio. Mr. Phelps won anyway, and the face became a social media meme. Intel hopes to ride some ripples from that #PhelpsFace wave in new ads from McGarryBowen breaking online this week and on TV Oct. 17 during "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" on CBS. The new ads back Intel's recently launched Seventh Gen procesor. The idea originally came during a different Olympic moment, said Intel Chief Marketing Officer Steven Fund, when Mr. Phelps was "watching himself swim, looking at the image through a very old computer. And we came up with the idea of the world's fastest swimmer on the world's slowest computer." Intel reached out to Mr. Phelps through his agent during the games, shot the ad and related social media content shortly thereafter, and, Mr. Fund said, "Got on air I think before anyone else has done anything with him post-Olympics." Mr. Phelps was already a fairly prolific endorser for, among others, Under Armour, Omega and 800razors.com (an online razor retailer he's also an investor in). Mr. Fund, himself a former global marketing director on Procter & Gamble Co.'s Gillette, saw him as a good fit for Intel as well. The message is basically the same one Mr. Parsons has been delivering: It's time to upgrade your computer. And Mr. Parsons has been so effective, Intel had no interest in walking away from him for the new ads either. With a PC processor market share of more than 87%, something that beats even his alma mater Gillette in razor blades, Intel's primary focus is growing the PC category rather than market share, Mr. Fund said. Over recent years, people have been waiting longer to replace old PCs, he said. "But actually this past year PCs have stabilized, and there was in fact just data published by IDC that shows PCs have grown for the first time year over year." Indeed, both IDC and Gartner data showed the North American PC market growing in the second quarter after five quarters of declines. "I'd like to say most of it is the marketing," Mr. Fund said. "The Parsons campaign is our best advertising ever. We test everything at Intel. It's got great breakthrough. It's very clear on message, and persuasion metrics are very strong." He declined to disclose spending, but said the new Phelps-Parsons effort will get significant weight both online and on TV. Intel's in-house Agency Inside has joined McGarryBowen in creating social content for the broader effort, with OMD handling media.

Published on October 12, 2016. Magna has revised its U.S. ad spending forecast upward. Credit: Magna Most Popular Magna expects 2016 to see the largest increase in United States ad spending in six years. The IPG Mediabrands' agency revised its forecast for the year on Wednesday, predicting ad revenue in the U.S. will grow to $179 billion, a 6.3% increase. In June, Magna had predicted a 6.2% jump in ad revenue. A 6.3% jump would represent the strongest growth rate since 2010, when revenue increased 6.6%. Excluding incremental ad sales generated by the 2016 presidential election and the Summer Olympics, ad growth would be 4.4%, in line with last year's growth of 4.3%. The revised forecast comes following a stronger-than-expected first-half of the year, with ad revenue climbing nearly 7%. The first quarter actually saw the strongest year-over-year growth rate recorded in over a decade. Ad sales were driven by a 4.6% jump in national TV, 18.3% surge in digital media and 3.8% growth in out-of-home. Print and radio advertising continued to decline 9% and 2%, respectively. While some advertisers such as Procter & Gamble have publicly said that their digital media investments have proved disappointing and they are re-allocating dollars back to TV, Magna said overall advertisers did not reduce their digital advertising in the first half of the year. Instead they increased spending on both digital and national TV advertising at the expense of print and radio. Overall ad growth is expected to slow in 2017 due to a lack of tentpole events, with Magna expecting a much more modest 1.4% increase for the year. Still, Magna predicted that underlying demand will remain strong. For the first time ever, digital advertising this year will equal TV ad sales, with both generating about $68 billion, according to Magna. Growing at 44%, social media advertising is the biggest contributing factor in digital advertising equaling TV ad sales. By the end of the decade, digital ad sales is expected to reach $105 billion. ~ ~ ~ CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story stated that The IPG Mediabrands' agency revised its forecast for the year, predicting ad revenue in the U.S. will grow to $179 billion, a 6.5% increase. It is a 6.3% increase.

Photo / Getty Images The pay of executives of a company, whether in salary, bonuses or other types of remuneration, is usually justified as an incentive to improve the financial performance of a company. This has led to ever more complex performance packages with increasing percentage of variable, performance-based payments. But what is increasingly evident is that this definition of a role of an executive needs to change, as do the incentives, to act not only in the best financial interests of the company but to focus on how it serves the wider community. How executive pay changed for the worst Executives payments are in the spotlight in Australia and overseas, yet again as companies report this information. As the market for top executives is global, there is a limited talent pool. In essence, if an Australian company is not prepared to pay the going rate, the talent will go elsewhere in the world to where a company is prepared to pay. The design of executive pay in Australia has undergone significant change since the mid 1990s, when executive pay began to pick up. A smaller percentage of an Australian executive's reward package was subject to performance incentives 20 years ago. A majority were on fixed pay or with short-term bonuses payable when they reached a specific measurable target. Today, the variable component of executive pay is much higher. Continued below. Related Content NZ's biggest leaky building case begins Chris Rattue: Give Aaron Smith a disability lesson Unhappy workplaces look a lot like unhappy marriages, new research shows Findings from a survey on executive remuneration by the Australian Human Resource Institute shows that within Australia, executive pay is typically comprised of three components: fixed remuneration and short and long-term incentives. This three-part structure is endorsed by the human resource profession as it acknowledges not only the skill and experience an executive brings to a role (fixed remuneration) but the effort an individual executive makes to change performance and culture leading to better financial performance (short-term incentive) and improvement to shareholder returns (long-term incentives). However, an increasing number of studies show these type of performance schemes do not lead to better organisational performance and actually have dangerous outcomes. This is because it incentivises executives' risk-taking and short-term orientation and can lead to disastrous outcomes, such as the Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers collapses. A 2003 Australian study shows that performance-based executive remuneration has not lead to increased performance by Australian companies. Current executive remuneration focuses heavily on short-term financial performance ignoring other success factors, such as customer satisfaction. For example, Commonwealth Bank CEO Ian Narev is one of the highest paid executives in Australia in 2016 despite a series of recent scandals that shook the bank. Another distortion created by finance based incentives is the temporary effects of executive payment packages. BHP CEO Andrew Mackenzie's pay was halved due to the company's loss and he was left to deal with decisions made by his predecessor. The former CEO, Marius Kloppers, walked away with a sizeable pay package in large part due to his term coinciding with very favourable economic conditions for mining and the fact that he could vest both his short and long-term incentives before leaving. These limitations of current performance-based payment schemes have led to the proposal of payment packages that enable executives to sell only a fraction of shares awarded to them each year. This includes a specified number of years after retirement, combined with limitations on unwinding. Such schemes still reward executives for improving companies' performance but do not lead to short-term thinking and risk-taking. Unfortunately, changes to performance payment schemes are still rare. The alternatives While some companies in the US have started to bind performance payments to long-term results, such as Goldman Sachs, Procter & Gamble and Morgan Stanley, companies in Australia still haven't followed suit. One Australian organisation that has made changes to address the above challenges in executives' remuneration is fund management agency the Future Fund. There are more radical suggestions such as completely abolishing pay-for-performance. The suggestion to abolish performance payment is aligned with the concept of stewardship. Stewardship is about placing others' long-term interests ahead of personal goals that serve an individual's self interests. According to stewardship theory, executives are custodians of their organisations and are intrinsically motivated to contribute to their welfare and prosperity. It's their personal beliefs and intrinsic motivation that drives their performance, not performance-based payments. Revising performance structures is just one measure to increase stewardship among executives. Stewardship is based on fundamentally different assumptions about human nature than financial performance incentives. It emphasises the social orientation and profession-like behaviour of managers. However you can't rely on human nature alone, other measures are needed to change the institutional context in which businesses operate. These include changing the laws to reflect that the role of business in society goes beyond financial performance. Another measure is changing business education to cultivate future business leaders in moral judgement and accountabilities. The recruiting process can also change to select candidates with demonstrated long-term orientation and care for all stakeholders, rather than based on the current focus on past financial performance. Another measure is introducing external remuneration committees with employee representation and excluding current directors. Such changes to the institutional context require a significant rethink of current business and economic practices and government policies. Despite calls for such changes in Australia and overseas, there is little we can be optimistic about at the moment. This article was originally published on The Conversation.

Published on October 13, 2016 at 1:00 am Last update on October 13, 2016 at 1:23 am By Will Clark The Board of Regents approved a $1.46 million budget Tuesday for a branding initiative in which the UT System will partner with creative agencies to better unite the UT System brand. Teri Thompson, chief marketing officer for the UT System, explained the goal of the initiative is to enrich and complement the branding activities of UT’s 14 different institutions so everyone from donors to parents of prospective students understands the power of the UT System. “We have amazing institutions that are doing amazing things, individually,” Thompson said. “But imagine the lift we could get if we also talk at the same time about what’s going on collectively.” The Regents voted unanimously with one abstention at their most recent meeting, approving the plan and $1.46 million for a one-year contract with sister agencies GSD&M and Interbrand, which are both owned by Omnicom. The partnership between the agencies creates a single-stop solution for this challenge, and a critical step will be listening to students, faculty and other key stakeholders to understand which approach makes the most sense, according to GSD&M CEO Duff Stewart. “I think we want to move away from being a family of brands to really a branded family,” Stewart said. “That shows the power of the institution. I don’t know how that comes to life in the articulation because we’ve got to talk to the people that are deeply immersed in the day-to-day.” Austin-based GSD&M created the UT motto “What starts here changes the world,” and coined the phrase “Don’t Mess With Texas” for an anti-litter ad campaign. Stewart said the initiative’s return on investment will be recognition of the strength and power of the UT System. “It’s not that we’re 14 institutions,” Stewart said. “It’s that when you have the strength of the people and the strength of the character of those institutions, together they form a very powerful institution: the University of Texas System.” According to Thompson, the plan will draw from brand models such as the NFL, Procter & Gamble, The Hershey Company and other university systems. Randa Safady, vice chancellor for external relations for the UT System, oversaw the creation of this plan and said she understands these institutions are highly differentiated and have a unique character. “That’s very important to us,” Safady said. “We should not and will not attempt to interrupt it by any of our proposed branding activities.” View the discussion thread.
