REUTERS/Andrew Kelly By Michael Flaherty and Siddharth Cavale Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), maker of Tide detergent and Gillette razors, will face ever greater pressure to slice costs and slow-growing divisions now that activist investor Trian Partners is a major shareholder. P&G's shares hit a two-year high on Wednesday after Trian disclosed a stake in the consumer products company, which is already trying to slim down by selling unprofitable brands. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters that Trian currently holds more than $3 billion of P&G's stock. Trian has a track record of pressuring large consumer companies to break up, a history investors and analysts are seizing on with the fund's newest investment. But Trian has yet to publish a white paper, and the firm's exact plan remains to be seen. In addition to breaking P&G into separate companies, analysts speculated that Trian could press for more brand divestitures and heavy-handed cost overhauls. "Absent a two- or three-way breakup, we suppose Peltz could also call for a 3G-like attack on the company's cost structure," said Don Bilson, director of research at Gordon Haskett, which tracks M&A and activism. Bilson was referring to 3G Capital, a private equity firm that embraces a hard-core cost cutting strategy known as zero-based budgeting. Cincinnati-based P&G is a $225 billion behemoth, selling brands such as Crest toothpaste to consumers across the globe. Bernstein Research said in January 2016 it conducted a survey of P&G's institutional investors and found that two-thirds favored a break-up. A break-up could result in the beauty, grooming and healthcare division becoming one company, with P&G separating out everything else, such as its laundry and diaper units, Bernstein said in the report. Regardless of whether it wants a break-up, Trian is expected to pressure P&G to keep reducing costs while increasing revenues, a mantra it presses all of its companies to embrace. P&G has been selling off unprofitable brands, including 41 beauty brands to Coty Inc (COTY.N), and focusing on core brands such as Tide, Pampers and Gillette to revive sluggish sales. However, those efforts have failed to boost its stock much beyond where it traded two years ago. Braun, Clearblue, Bounty and Charmin are other brands that Trian could press to be sold, bankers said on Tuesday. P&G's annual meeting is not until October and its deadline to nominate directors expires in June, meaning the company and Trian have several months to negotiate whether or not to give the investor board representation or take the matter to a shareholder vote. P&G's shares were up 3.7 percent at $91.12. The stock was the biggest boost to the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI on Wednesday but has lagged peers and the S&P 500 index during the past three years. TRIAN Trian, founded in 2005 by Nelson Peltz, Ed Garden and Peter May, focuses mainly on consumer brand companies, industrial firms and financial companies. The firm has $14 billion in assets under management. Trian said in a filing on Tuesday that it held 6.4 million shares, worth $556.8 million as of Dec. 31 of last year. That position has grown to more than $3 billion as of Tuesday, the person familiar with the matter told Reuters, which would make Trian a top 10 shareholder. Trian pressured PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N) to spin off its beverage business from its snacks division, a campaign that the company never heeded though it did hand the investor a board seat in 2015 to make peace. In 2012, under pressure from Trian, Kraft spun off its North American grocery business and its global snack division to become Mondelez International, the maker of Oreos, Cadbury chocolate and Wheat Thins. Trian and P&G declined to comment on Wednesday. "We see Trian's P&G stake as late in the company's turnaround process," RBC Capital markets analyst Nik Modi wrote. Modi said Chief Executive David Taylor is appropriately managing the business and targeting the three major buckets that Trian could address: portfolio alignment, cost and revenues.

But as prescient as the Oracle of Omaha has proved to be over the years, that doesn't mean you should run out and buy all of the stocks today. In some cases, the shares are much pricier now than when Buffett first purchased them. In other cases, the holdings are relatively small. "Any Berkshire investment worth less than $100 million, I ignore," says David Kass, a professor at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business who studies Buffett and is a Berkshire shareholder. More often than not, Buffett doesn't comment on his investment moves, so it's not always possible to know his reasoning behind a big stock purchase or sale. But for buy-and-hold investors, Berkshire's stakes in blue-chip companies can be instructive nonetheless. Here's a closer look at the 11 Dow stocks owned by Warren Buffett. Data is as of February 13, 2017, unless otherwise indicated. Click on symbol links in each slide for current share prices and more. American Express Look no further than American Express to understand just how serious Warren Buffett is about investing for the long haul. He picked up his initial stake in the credit card company in 1991, when a struggling AmEx badly needed capital. Berkshire obliged, getting favorable terms on its investment. As of December 31, 2016, Berkshire owned 16.6% of AmEx's outstanding shares, according to CNBC's Berkshire Hathaway Portfolio Tracker . Buffett has played the role of white knight many times over the years, including during the 2008 financial crisis, as a means to get stakes in good companies at a discount. The stock today: AmEx shares change hands at 14 times expected earnings for 2017, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters. That's in line with the stock's five-year average. Although the stock doesn't look particularly cheap, neither does it look expensive. Based on current estimates, the price/earnings ratio of the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is about 17. Analysts at William Blair Equity Research say the diversity of AmEx's business is underappreciated. The firm has a rating of "outperform" (buy, essentially) on the stock. SEE ALSO: 25 Dividend Stocks You Can Buy and Hold Forever Apple Buffett doesn't deserve all the credit for all of Berkshire's investments. In fact, the decision to buy Apple shares last year was made by one of Buffett's stock-picking lieutenants. Apple does have some of the attributes Buffett has said he likes: It's a leader in its market, and it has a ton of cash at its disposal. The stock was also trading at lower levels when Berkshire did its buying in 2016. The stock today: With shares reaching new highs, Apple is much more expensive now than it was when Berkshire first took a stake. But UBS analysts say the price gain is deserved because the number of iPhones in use continues to grow by double-digit percentages and retention rates remain high. UBS rates Apple stock a "buy," but picking up shares on dips over time might be preferable to going all in at today's record prices. SEE ALSO: 10 Stocks Every Retiree Should Own Coca-Cola Buffett famously watched Coca-Cola for 52 years before investing in the stock. He finally took the plunge in 1988. "We expect to hold these securities for a long time," Buffett wrote back then of his new stake in Coke in a letter to Berkshire shareholders. "In fact, when we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever." As of December 31, 2016, Berkshire owned 9.4% of Coca-Cola's outstanding shares. The stock today: Coca-Cola currently trades at 21 times expected earnings. That's a bit rich, given that analysts project average earnings growth of just 2% a year for the next five years, according to Thomson Reuters. Analysts at Credit Suisse have a "neutral" rating on the stock (hold, essentially), saying they have concerns about an expansion of global regulations on sweetened products. If you already own the stock, find comfort in a plump dividend that has increased 54 years in a row. General Electric Berkshire's stake can be traced back to the lifeline that Buffett threw to General Electric in 2008. At the time, GE's finance arm was suffering the same as other big banks. "The GE investment resulted from Buffett's reputation and personal relationships, and Berkshire's very large cash position during the financial crisis," Kass says. But Buffett wouldn't have stepped in if he didn't believe in the company. "GE is the symbol of American business to the world," Buffett said at the time. "I am confident that GE will continue to be successful in the years to come." Berkshire received preferred shares and warrants in exchange for cash. The preferred shares paid handsome dividends until GE later bought them back, and the warrants gave Berkshire the right to buy GE common shares at below-market prices. Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs is another holding Berkshire picked up during the 2008 financial crisis. Buffett paid $5 billion for preferred shares and warrants to purchase common stock. The preferred shares came with a dividend yield of 10%. Buffett said the investments in Goldman Sachs and General Electric - and similar deals with Dow Chemical, Swiss Re and Wrigley - delivered a total of $2.1 billion annually in dividends and interest. Berkshire bought another $2 billion in Goldman stock when it exercised the warrants in 2013. Goldman redeemed its preferred shares in 2011. The stock today: Credit Suisse analysts rate Goldman shares at "outperform," thanks in large part to the potential for lower corporate taxes and loosened financial regulations under the Trump administration. Not everyone is as enthusiastic about the stock, however, especially in light of its 35% share-price gain since Election Day. Of the 18 analysts surveyed by Zacks, seven have Goldman at "strong buy," two rate it a "buy," eight rate it a "hold" and one has a "strong sell" recommendation on the shares. International Business Machines Longtime Berkshire watchers were surprised when the company revealed this stake in 2011 because Buffett had shown little interest in technology stocks. But after reading IBM's annual reports for more than 50 years without buying a single share, he was finally swayed by what he saw closer to home. "We went around to all of our companies to see how their IT departments functioned ... and I just came away with a different view of the position that IBM holds within IT departments and why they hold it and the stickiness and a whole bunch of things," Buffett said at the time. Berkshire owned 8.5% of IBM's outstanding shares as of December 31, 2016. The stock today: UBS is "neutral" on IBM, but it says better times might be ahead now that a period of heavy investment back into the business is slowing down. Cost cuts will bolster the bottom line, and the company's Watson cognitive computing division is showing early promise. Buffett-like patience might be required, though, considering that the stock price has been stagnant for the past five years. IBM's solid dividend yield helps. SEE ALSO: 10 Best Dividend Stocks in the Dow Averages Johnson & Johnson During the 2008 financial crisis, Buffett reluctantly sold Johnson & Johnson shares to raise cash to invest in Goldman Sachs, GE and other struggling companies. By 2012, the reluctance had disappeared and Berkshire had essentially dumped its position in J&J, with Buffett saying the company was "messed up in a lot of ways" due to production problems and recalls. Despite the shift in sentiment, Kass says Berkshire's initial foray into J&J made sense because the stock was undervalued at the time. The stock today: The outlook for J&J is brighter these days than it was when Buffett abandoned ship, though the majority of analysts who follow the company are content to stand pat for now. Of the 18 analysts surveyed by Zacks, 10 rate it at "hold." Seven consider the stock a "buy" or "strong buy" and just one calls it a "sell." Income investors can rest easy. The dividend is as secure as it can be, having been raised every year for 54 straight years. Procter & Gamble Berkshire was a longtime shareholder in Gillette when Procter & Gamble acquired the razor blade company in 2005. Buffett called it a "dream deal," as Berkshire received P&G shares in exchange for its Gillette holdings. As with Johnson & Johnson, Buffett reluctantly sold some P&G shares in 2008 to raise cash to invest in distressed companies. Cut to 2014. Berkshire struck a deal to buy Duracell from P&G. To avoid a big tax bill, Berkshire arranged to hand over its P&G shares rather than pay cash for Duracell. The stock today: William Blair Equity Research rates P&G at "outperform," noting that its focus on major brands, such as Tide detergent, and cost cuts offer "a solid total shareholder return opportunity." Shares are not on sale, however, trading at 21 times year-ahead earnings. For comparison, the S&P 500 trades at 17 times future earnings. P&G's dividend is the definition of reliable; it dates back to 1891. Visa Credit cards are a Berkshire staple. The holding company also owns stakes in MasterCard and the aforementioned America Express. But Visa and MasterCard are growing faster than AmEx, says Kass, and both are investments of Todd Combs, one of Berkshire's chief investing strategists not named Warren. Payments processing is a rapidly expanding market, thanks to the emergence of mobile payments, such as Apple Pay. Global revenue from mobile payments is forecast to exceed $1 trillion by 2019, up from $450 billion in 2015, according to Statista, a data research firm. The stock today: "On the heels of solid December quarter results, we are raising our estimates and reiterate our Outperform rating on Visa," says Credit Suisse. "We believe shares are attractively valued at 21 times ... calendar 2018 earnings." And while the dividend yield is nothing to write home about, Visa shares have proved their long-term worth by outpacing rivals MasterCard and AmEx in price growth over the past two, five and 10 years. Verizon Verizon seems like an unlikely bet for Buffett in some ways. Its future is hitched to growth in digital mobile content and advertising, which makes it something of a bet on tech. That why it's probably not a Buffett call. "Verizon is likely an investment of Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, who have several telecom stocks in their portfolio," says Kass of Buffett's two chief stock-picking lieutenants. Either way, Berkshire all but abandoned its position at the end of last year, selling most of its 15 million shares. The stock today: The first thing that stands out with Verizon is the high dividend yield. Even better for income investors is the fact that the company has raised its payout every year since 2006. However, most analysts think the stock will underperform the S&P 500 this year. Of the 25 analysts surveyed by Zacks, 18 rate the shares at "hold," five have it at "buy" or "strong buy," and two rate it at "sell." William Blair Equity Research, which rates the company at "market perform" (hold, essentially), notes that intense competition is hurting financial results of late. Verizon, which bought AOL in 2015, is in the process of acquiring Yahoo, though it's far from a done deal after Yahoo disclosed serious security breaches that exposed user information to hackers. TAKE THE QUIZ: How Well Do You Really Know Warren Buffett? Walmart Stores Buffett sold off big chunks of Berkshire's Walmart stake last year. That's because the retailer is losing out to Amazon.com, Kass says. Buffett has made no secret of his admiration for Amazon's CEO, Jeff Bezos. "We haven't seen many businessmen like him," Buffett says of Bezos. "Overwhelmingly, he's taken things you and I've been buying and he's figured out a way to make us happier buying those products, either by fast delivery or prices or whatever it may be, and that's remarkable." The stock today: Berkshire first bought Walmart in 2005, and it has been a disappointing investment. Shares in the world's largest retailer have gained 32% on a price basis since mid 2005. The S&P 500 is up 80% over the same time frame. Analysts at Stifel have a "hold" recommendation on Walmart shares . "We think a continued focus on grocery, including improved online and mobile ordering and increased offerings of more healthful products (i.e., organic), will continue to drive modest share gains," Stifel analysts say.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson By By Michael Flaherty, Reuters Feb 14, 2017 at 5:27 pm | Print View Trian Fund Management LP on Tuesday disclosed that it bought a $3.5 billion stake in Procter & Gamble Co, making it the second activist shareholder to take aim at the consumer products giant in the last five years. Cincinnati, Ohio-based P&G, maker of Tide detergent, Gillette razors and Crest toothpaste, is a $225 billion behemoth whose stock price has hardly budged from the $85 per share range in the last two years. The stock closed at $87.86 on Tuesday, a few dollars above where it traded this time two years ago. Trian was founded in 2005 by Nelson Peltz, Ed Garden and Peter May. The investment fund focuses mainly on three sectors: consumer brand companies, industrial and financial firms. The New York-based firm is known for making large investments in a small amount of companies where it pushes for board representation and for strategic moves that will increase revenues while reducing expenses. At $3.5 billion, Trian’s stake in P&G is its largest position by far. Trian’s current portfolio includes Mondelez International Inc , maker of Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolate, and industrial group General Electric . Activist hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management invested in Procter & Gamble in 2012, and called for the ouster of its then CEO, Robert McDonald. P&G reported better-than-expected quarterly sales last month, driven partly by its beauty and health care businesses, and raised its fiscal 2017 forecast for organic sales growth.

 Billionaire investor Nelson Peltz took a huge stake in Procter & Gamble — and P&G's stock is soaring Portia Crowe Feb. 14, 2017, 5:12 PM 2,965 facebook linkedin twitter email print YouTube/Gillette Trian Fund Management, the activist hedge fund cofounded by billionaire Nelson Peltz, has taken a stake in Procter & Gamble, The Wall Street Journal reports. P&G's stock was up 4% in after-hours trading on the news. Trian is the second activist hedge fund to invest in P&G in recent years. In 2012, Bill Ackman's Pershing Square invested, leading then-CEO Robert McDonald to step down within a year, the Journal reported. P&G is the maker of everything from Gillette to Crest to Pantene to Tampax. Peltz said in December that he had taken a new position but did not disclose which company it was in. His firm raised a special fund in recent months exclusively for its P&G position, according to the Journal report.  A number of other hedge funds disclosed new positions in 13-F filings on Tuesday.

Posted 15 Feb 2017 23:15 Updated 16 Feb 2017 05:50 Procter & Gamble's Head & Shoulders is seen in a store in Manhattan, New York, U.S., August 1, 2016. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Procter & Gamble Co , maker of Tide detergent and Gillette razors, will face ever greater pressure to slice costs and slow-growing divisions now that activist investor Trian Partners is a major shareholder. P&G's shares hit a two-year high on Wednesday after Trian disclosed a stake in the consumer products company, which is already trying to slim down by selling unprofitable brands. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters that Trian currently holds more than US$3 billion of P&G's stock. Trian has a track record of pressuring large consumer companies to break up, a history investors and analysts are seizing on with the fund's newest investment. But Trian has yet to publish a white paper, and the firm's exact plan remains to be seen. In addition to breaking P&G into separate companies, analysts speculated that Trian could press for more brand divestitures and heavy-handed cost overhauls. "Absent a two- or three-way breakup, we suppose Peltz could also call for a 3G-like attack on the company's cost structure," said Don Bilson, director of research at Gordon Haskett, which tracks M&A and activism. Bilson was referring to 3G Capital, a private equity firm that embraces a hard-core cost cutting strategy known as zero-based budgeting. Cincinnati-based P&G is a US$225 billion behemoth, selling brands such as Crest toothpaste to consumers across the globe. Bernstein Research said in January 2016 it conducted a survey of P&G's institutional investors and found that two-thirds favored a break-up. A break-up could result in the beauty, grooming and healthcare division becoming one company, with P&G separating out everything else, such as its laundry and diaper units, Bernstein said in the report. Regardless of whether it wants a break-up, Trian is expected to pressure P&G to keep reducing costs while increasing revenues, a mantra it presses all of its companies to embrace. P&G has been selling off unprofitable brands, including 41 beauty brands to Coty Inc , and focusing on core brands such as Tide, Pampers and Gillette to revive sluggish sales. However, those efforts have failed to boost its stock much beyond where it traded two years ago. Braun, Clearblue, Bounty and Charmin are other brands that Trian could press to be sold, bankers said on Tuesday. P&G's annual meeting is not until October and its deadline to nominate directors expires in June, meaning the company and Trian have several months to negotiate whether or not to give the investor board representation or take the matter to a shareholder vote. P&G's shares were up 3.7 percent at US$91.12. The stock was the biggest boost to the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday but has lagged peers and the S&P 500 index during the past three years. TRIAN Trian, founded in 2005 by Nelson Peltz, Ed Garden and Peter May, focuses mainly on consumer brand companies, industrial firms and financial companies. The firm has US$14 billion in assets under management. Trian said in a filing on Tuesday that it held 6.4 million shares, worth US$556.8 million as of Dec. 31 of last year. That position has grown to more than US$3 billion as of Tuesday, the person familiar with the matter told Reuters, which would make Trian a top 10 shareholder. Trian pressured PepsiCo Inc to spin off its beverage business from its snacks division, a campaign that the company never heeded though it did hand the investor a board seat in 2015 to make peace. In 2012, under pressure from Trian, Kraft spun off its North American grocery business and its global snack division to become Mondelez International, the maker of Oreos, Cadbury chocolate and Wheat Thins. Trian and P&G declined to comment on Wednesday. "We see Trian's P&G stake as late in the company's turnaround process," RBC Capital markets analyst Nik Modi wrote. Modi said Chief Executive David Taylor is appropriately managing the business and targeting the three major buckets that Trian could address: portfolio alignment, cost and revenues.

"As long as we stay focused on that, the market is going to continue to go higher." The president continued to tout his economic agenda in a meeting with retail CEOs Wednesday. He said the administration remains "focused on the issues that will bring economic growth. That's what we're all about." The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT) traded about two thirds of a percent higher. However, shares of H&R Block hit a session low after Trump said the company probably wouldn't like his tax reform plan. Shares recovered to trade about 0.7 percent lower. The S&P 500 gained 0.5 percent, and the Nasdaq added 0.64 percent. "We're halfway through the first quarter, and ... people have to chase performance," said Peter Coleman, head trader at Convergex. "At the end of the day, the sentiment is you're going to get some tax reform and some infrastructure policy," he said. Stocks had closed at record highs again on Tuesday, lifted by the financials sector, which received a lift from higher interest rates. The major U.S. stock indexes had traded mostly sideways this year, until Trump said last week the administration will be releasing a "phenomenal" tax plan in the next two-to-three weeks. "I think what may have started off as short covering, then a short squeeze, has brought in some money off the sidelines into the more cyclical areas of the market," said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth. The financials sector is up more than 22 percent since the election as the top performer in the S&P 500. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) traded more than half a percent higher Wednesday at an all-time high. The initial pop in equities following Trump's election was mostly spurred by hopes of infrastructure spending, deregulation and lower corporate taxes. But the transition into Trump's presidency has been bumpy. On Monday, Trump's National Security Advisor Michael Flynn resigned from his post after days of speculation about his status within the administration and intense scrutiny into his discussions about Russia prior to Trump's inauguration. "The market has been surprisingly generous to Trump," said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. "If we learn that Trump did something unethical ahead of the election, then that would have some impact. But barring something of that magnitude, I think the market will continue to shrug off those issues." In economic news, the consumer price index (CPI) rose a more-than-expected 0.6 percent in January, the largest monthly gain since February 2013. In the 12 months through January, the CPI increased 2.5 percent, the biggest year-on-year gain since March 2012. After the inflation report, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan economists increased their expectations for a rate hike as soon as March or May. U.S. Treasury yields spiked following data releases, with the benchmark 10-year note yield breaking above 2.5 percent, while the shorter-term two-year note yield briefly climbed to 1.26 percent. The U.S. dollar traded lower against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.059 and the yen around 114.2. Retail sales also beat expectations, with the headline number showing a 0.4 percent rise for January after an upwardly revised 1 percent gain in December. The so-called core retail sales, excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, posted a 0.4 percent rise. "You can see that the picture is changing as inflation has picked up over in China and this is having a more prominent impact over in the U.S.," said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, in a note. "The U.S. retail sales data was hot and it tells us how much investors are willing to dig deep into their pockets and how confident they are in their spending attitude." Other data released include business inventories for December, which rose 0.4 percent, and the February read on U.S. home builder sentiment, which showed a decline. "This market, for a long time, was hungry for a growth story," said Jim Davis, regional investment manager for The Private Client Group of U.S. Bank. "Every time we get a number supporting that, more people jump on the bandwagon." Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen testified in front of Congress for the second straight day. On Tuesday, she said it would be "unwise" for the U.S. central bank to wait too long to raise interest rates, lifting market expectations for a March rate hike. "Our view is the over/under on rate hikes for this year is at two. But the data continue to come in stronger," said Michael Collins, senior investment officer at PGIM Fixed Income. "I think it gives the Fed more room to act how they've communicated." "But there are still a lot of risks in the global economy, and in the U.S. there is some policy risk," he said. Gold futures for April delivery rose 0.59 percent to $1,232.60 per ounce. U.S. crude futures for March delivery fell 0.2 percent to $53.10 per barrel.  U.S. crude oil futures for March delivery settled down 9 cents at $53.11 a barrel.

According to allegations raised in a product liability lawsuit recently filed against AstraZeneca and Procter & Gamble, the combined side effects of Nexium, Prilosec and Prilosec OTC used over a period of several years caused an Illinois woman to suffer chronic kidney disease and acute renal failure.  The complaint (PDF) was filed by Irma Coleman in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois on February 8, indicating that the drug makers failed to adequately warn consumers and the medical community about the risk that the popular heartburn medications may injure the kidneys. Coleman states that she used Prilosec and Prilosec OTC from January 2009 through February 2014, and then switched to Nexium from February 2013 to January 2015. As a result of the medications, the lawsuit alleges that Coleman developed chronic kidney disease (CKD) in July 2014, and was then diagnosed with acute renal failure in May 2015. Nexium and Prilosec are two of the most widely used brand-name medications in the U.S., which are both part of a popular class of heartburn drugs known as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which also includes Prevacid, Protonix, Dexilant and others. Several of the medications are now available as generics over-the-counter. The lawsuit indicates that Coleman may have been able to avoid the kidney problems from Nexium and Prilosec if the pharmaceutical companies had not withheld and concealed important side effect information, and misrepresented that the drugs were safe to use every day. “As a result of the defective nature of PPIs, persons who ingested this product, including Plaintiff, suffered and may continue to suffer from kidney injuries including acute interstitial nephritis (‘AIN’), acute kidney injuries (‘AKI’), chronic kidney disease (‘CKD’) and renal failure, also known as end-stage renal disease (‘ESRD’),” the lawsuit states. “Defendants concealed and continue to conceal their knowledge of PPIs’ unreasonably dangerous risks from Plaintiff, her physicians, other consumers, and the medical community. Specifically, Defendants failed to adequately inform consumers and the prescribing medical community about the magnified risk of kidney injuries related to the use of PPIs.” The complaint joins dozens of other Nexium lawsuits, Prilosec lawsuits, Protonix lawsuits, Prevacid lawsuits and Dexilant lawsuits brought by individuals nationwide in recent months, claiming that the drug makers withheld information about the risks associated with long-term use of the medications. As heartburn drug injury lawyers continue to review and file cases, it is expected that thousands of similar chronic kidney disease lawsuits and other claims over side effects of PPI medications could be filed in the coming months. Nexium and Prilosec Kidney Risks Since Nexium and other PPI drugs have lacked sufficient kidney warnings, they are widely believed to be safe by most consumers and doctors, and many individuals remain on the medications for years with little attempt to reduce use. However, a number of studies published in recent years have highlighted serious risks, including CKD, acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), acute kidney injury (AKI) and end-stage renal failure. In an independent study published by the medical journal CMAJ Open in April 2015, researchers found that users of PPI medications were 3 times more likely to suffer acute interstitial nephritis, which involves inflammation of the kidney. In addition, the study found that users were 2.5 times more likely to develop acute kidney injury, which involves an abrupt loss of kidney function. This research was followed by a study published last year in the medical journal JAMA Internal Medicine, which also found an increased risk of chronic kidney disease with the heartburn medications, indicating that users of Nexium, Prilosec and other PPI may be 50% more likely when compared to non-users. In April 2016, researchers with the Department of Veterans Affairs found that users of Nexium, Prilosec or other PPIs may be 96% more likely to develop renal failure and 28% more likely to develop chronic kidney disease after five years of use. Earlier this month, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation rejected a request to consolidate all federal proton pump inhibitor kidney damage lawsuits before one judge for pretrial proceedings, saying that the drugs were too dissimilar, and also direct competitors. Therefore, the complaint filed by Coleman, as well as other cases pending in courts nationwide, are moving forward as individual claims, without coordinated discovery.

Trian Fund Management, co-founded by Nelson Peltz, revealed a new stake in the consumer-products giant late Tuesday, sending shares up as much as 3.7 percent Wednesday. While the holding Trian disclosed for the period through Dec. 31 was just $539.5 million, the fund has been buying more this year and the investment is now valued at more than $3 billion, according to a person familiar with the situation who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly. P&G, the 179-year-old maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers, fits into Trian’s playbook of targeting mainly consumer, industrial and financial companies -- in particular conglomerates as well as food and beverage corporations. The hedge fund, founded in 2005 by Peltz, Peter May and Ed Garden, manages more than $10 billion in assets and prefers to shun the activist label, instead referring to itself as a highly engaged shareholder. In targeting P&G, known for its sclerotic and insular culture, Trian is taking aim at company that’s struggled for years to regain its footing as it fends off competition from newer and low-cost competitors such as Honest Co. and Church & Dwight Co. David Taylor came on as chief executive officer in November 2015, the third leader in five years, with a pledge to bring in more outside executives and set higher product standards. “Packaged-goods companies in general are confronting unprecedented changes in their marketplace,” including younger shoppers who aren’t as brand-loyal and want natural products, said David Garfield, head of the consumer-products practice at consulting firm AlixPartners LLP. “P&G has done a lot, and I think they should get full credit for making meaningful changes to date,” but companies in the sector need to be more nimble at adjusting to those changes, he said. Cutting Costs Taylor’s predecessor, A.G. Lafley -- a legendary chief executive who expanded the company’s global presence as well as its portfolio -- had come back to P&G for a second tenure in 2013. During his second term, Lafley divested non-central businesses such as pet food and batteries along with about 100 smaller brands. He also accelerated a $10 billion cost-cutting program that his predecessor had undertaken. P&G and its investors are now positioned to take advantage of that restructuring, along with an additional $10 billion in expense cuts announced by Taylor last year, said Erin Lash, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. in Chicago. Sales from premium products like Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor blades helped the company post better-than-expected second-quarter earnings, P&G reported last month. Given that momentum, “we don’t feel it is likely that Peltz will call for additional steps to transform the business at this time,” Lash said. But if the company can’t sustain the gains, he could push for further cost cuts and divestitures, she added. White Papers P&G wasn’t aware of Trian’s stake in the company before Tuesday’s filing and hadn’t had contact with the investor before it was revealed, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private information. A spokeswoman for Trian said the fund isn’t commenting on its new investment in P&G. The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up In past campaigns, Trian has released detailed white papers on some of its targets, usually insisting that one of its principals joins the board. Bill Schmitz, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG, expects a paper on P&G to follow the filing, he wrote in a research note. That paper would probably detail the investment case and look at the strategic and financial benefits of splitting up the company, acquisition opportunities and external management appointees, Schmitz wrote. Sysco Stake Trian’s biggest disclosed holding is food distributor Sysco Corp., in which it took a stake after a planned takeover of rival US Foods was nixed. When it disclosed the initial Sysco stake, Trian said the company could improve its operating margins, consider borrowing money to return more capital to shareholders and “better align management compensation with corporate performance.” Peltz and Trian partner Josh Frank were added to the board within a week. The fund has also invested in PepsiCo Inc. -- a stake that in May it said it no longer held -- as well as Wendy’s Co., Mondelez International Inc. and General Electric Co. One of Trian’s most recent high-profile campaigns was at DuPont Co., where the fund argued as early as 2013 that the company should be broken up to realize shareholder value. Peltz said on CNBC in 2015 he was “thrilled” with DuPont’s $60 billion merger with Dow Chemical Co. Ackman, known for seeking management changes and company breakups, disclosed a $1.8 billion stake in P&G in July 2012 and pushed to replace then-CEO Bob McDonald, who was in the midst of a $10 billion cost-cutting program. P&G did get rid of McDonald the following year and bring back Lafley. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The investment from Trian has it taking a $3.5 billion stake in Procter & Gamble Co.  It is likely that Trian is interested in reducing the size of the company. PG has already been working on this and sold 41 of its brands last year. The $3.5 billion stake in Procter & Gamble Co is the largest that Trian has ever taken out. Its decision to invest in Procter & Gamble Co lines up with its focus on consumer brand companies. It’s strategies include investing in companies to gain board seats so that it can reduce expenses and increase revenue. Trian may push for board seats at Procter & Gamble now that it has such a large investment in the company. PG has until June 13 to nominate more members to its board and it’s likely that Trian will be looking to negotiate for some of those seats, reports Reuters. Trian’s $3.5 billion stake in Procter & Gamble Co comes to roughly 6.42 million shares. While the activist investor will likely try to slim the company down, it may meet resistance. PG’s last earnings report saw it beat out Wall Street’s earnings per share and revenue estimates for that quarter. This may give it a strong position to argue against further slimming of the company. “P&G welcomes investment in our company,” Damon Jones, a Procter & Gamble Co spokesman, told Reuters. “We will continue to do what we always do.” PG stock was up 3% as of noon Wednesday.

(Photo: Gene J. Puskar, AP) 24 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 6 COMMENTEMAILMORE CINCINNATI — Procter & Gamble CEO David Taylor is facing the heightened investor scrutiny after a hedge fund disclosed on Tuesday that it has taken a $3.5 billion stake in the company. Billionaire Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management has acknowledged its largest-ever investment, giving it a 1.6% stake in the Cincinnati-based consumer products giant, according to news reports.P&G owns a large portfolio of America's best-known consumer brands, from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper. The news intensifies pressure on Taylor to accelerate and complete the company's five-year turnaround efforts. If P&G fails to produce the rising sales and profits investors crave, the company will come under increasing pressure to step up cost-cutting, slash jobs, sell off businesses and even break up into two or more companies. "We are most inclined to wonder if Trian simply buys into the notion that a fundamental turnaround is taking hold at P&G with the added kicker that could push the company harder on cost cutting should revenue improvement not transpire as hoped," Barclays analyst Lauren Lieberman wrote Tuesday in an investor's note. Analysts say if early improvements during Taylor's 15-month tenure sputter, calls to split up the company could be renewed. "We have made the case that a breakup may be best for the company, as larger breakups typically result in greater stock returns versus smaller divestitures, and cost and top-line benefits from "scale" have been elusive for PG," Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj wrote Tuesday in a note to investors. Like other activist firms, Trian often advocates cost-cutting to eliminate bureaucracy and maximizing profits. Trian has sought to influence its target companies by seeking board seats. Trian also isn't shy about publishing blueprints to improve company results. Trian unsuccessfully pressed PepsiCo to split apart before selling out its stake last year. But its activism was influential in shaping the pending megamerger of Dow Chemical and DuPont. Still, Trian Fund Management's stake doesn't automatically buy itself the same access and influence as it might at smaller corporate targets. With a $225 billion market capitalization (the value of all outstanding stock), P&G is one of the 20 most valuable companies on the planet – worth more than the economies of Ireland, Chile or New Zealand or all of the region's Fortune 1000 companies combined four times over. Trian's 1.6% of P&G will buy it promptly returned phone calls and any turnaround advice will be politely received if not necessarily obeyed. Nonetheless, Taylor now has a high-profile potential critic that can move P&G's share price with every public utterance. Taylor's challenge ahead is to deliver financial results that merit a higher stock price. This fiscal year, P&G has delivered two quarters of modestly improving results. News of Trian's new investment will likely heighten scrutiny of a major address by chief financial officer Jon Moeller next week at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York's investor conference in Florida. Last year at the conference, P&G unveiled a second wave of $10 billion in cost-cutting that would be completed by 2021. Moeller will likely be asked by analysts if the company is moving fast enough on those planned cuts and whether even more might be in the works. In the meantime, a P&G spokesman said the company "welcomed" Trian's investment, but declined to comment on any discussions with major investors. P&G's past experience with activist investors has been mixed. In 2012, Bill Ackman's hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management bought a 1% stake in the company and called for big cuts, brand divestitures and the ouster of CEO Bob McDonald. Ackman probably hastened McDonald's departure 10 months later, but P&G management said it was already addressing many of the issues raised by Ackman with its own previously announced restructuring plan. Pershing Square Capital Management had sold off its stake by the time McDonald's successor CEO A.G. Lafley unveiled a sweeping 100-label brand divestiture. Eventually, the company also cut far more jobs than it originally outlined in 2012. From 2014 to 2016, P&G shed business units doing more than $8 billion in sales or the equivalent of a Fortune 500 company the size a Facebook. In the last five years, P&G has shed 34,000 jobs through buyouts and brand sales – more than a quarter of its jobs in 2011. P&G now employs 95,000, its smallest workforce since 2003.

The issue is in the green for the second day in a row, rallying from Monday's close ($14.97) to its current level. Bill Ackman's Pershing Square in December trimmed their stake by 3 million shares, which came to light in the firm's 13F on Tuesday. It should be noted Ackman has held a majority of his stake since the stock plunged from its all-time high ($263.81) made in August 2015. Related Link: 13F Roundup: Apple, Bank Of America And Other Stocks Hedge Funds Love/Hate After a flat open, Valeant's stock found support just under Tuesday's close ($15.98), reaching $15.77 before embarking on a rally. So far, it has reached $16.80 and isn't far off that level. That high comes in just above its January 11 high ($16.68), but is well shy of its January 10 high ($17.55).

"As long as we stay focused on that, the market is going to continue to go higher." The president continued to tout his economic agenda in a meeting with retail CEOs Wednesday. He said the administration remains "focused on the issues that will bring economic growth. That's what we're all about." The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT) traded about two thirds of a percent higher. However, shares of H&R Block hit a session low after Trump said the company probably wouldn't like his tax reform plan. Shares recovered to trade about 0.7 percent lower. The S&P 500 gained 0.5 percent, and the Nasdaq added 0.64 percent. "We're halfway through the first quarter, and ... people have to chase performance," said Peter Coleman, head trader at Convergex. "At the end of the day, the sentiment is you're going to get some tax reform and some infrastructure policy," he said. Stocks had closed at record highs again on Tuesday, lifted by the financials sector, which received a lift from higher interest rates. The major U.S. stock indexes had traded mostly sideways this year, until Trump said last week the administration will be releasing a "phenomenal" tax plan in the next two-to-three weeks. "I think what may have started off as short covering, then a short squeeze, has brought in some money off the sidelines into the more cyclical areas of the market," said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth. The financials sector is up more than 22 percent since the election as the top performer in the S&P 500. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) traded more than half a percent higher Wednesday at an all-time high. The initial pop in equities following Trump's election was mostly spurred by hopes of infrastructure spending, deregulation and lower corporate taxes. But the transition into Trump's presidency has been bumpy. On Monday, Trump's National Security Advisor Michael Flynn resigned from his post after days of speculation about his status within the administration and intense scrutiny into his discussions about Russia prior to Trump's inauguration. "The market has been surprisingly generous to Trump," said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. "If we learn that Trump did something unethical ahead of the election, then that would have some impact. But barring something of that magnitude, I think the market will continue to shrug off those issues." In economic news, the consumer price index (CPI) rose a more-than-expected 0.6 percent in January, the largest monthly gain since February 2013. In the 12 months through January, the CPI increased 2.5 percent, the biggest year-on-year gain since March 2012. After the inflation report, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan economists increased their expectations for a rate hike as soon as March or May. U.S. Treasury yields spiked following data releases, with the benchmark 10-year note yield breaking above 2.5 percent, while the shorter-term two-year note yield briefly climbed to 1.26 percent. The U.S. dollar traded lower against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.059 and the yen around 114.2. Retail sales also beat expectations, with the headline number showing a 0.4 percent rise for January after an upwardly revised 1 percent gain in December. The so-called core retail sales, excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, posted a 0.4 percent rise. "You can see that the picture is changing as inflation has picked up over in China and this is having a more prominent impact over in the U.S.," said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, in a note. "The U.S. retail sales data was hot and it tells us how much investors are willing to dig deep into their pockets and how confident they are in their spending attitude." Other data released include business inventories for December, which rose 0.4 percent, and the February read on U.S. home builder sentiment, which showed a decline. "This market, for a long time, was hungry for a growth story," said Jim Davis, regional investment manager for The Private Client Group of U.S. Bank. "Every time we get a number supporting that, more people jump on the bandwagon." Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen testified in front of Congress for the second straight day. On Tuesday, she said it would be "unwise" for the U.S. central bank to wait too long to raise interest rates, lifting market expectations for a March rate hike. "Our view is the over/under on rate hikes for this year is at two. But the data continue to come in stronger," said Michael Collins, senior investment officer at PGIM Fixed Income. "I think it gives the Fed more room to act how they've communicated." "But there are still a lot of risks in the global economy, and in the U.S. there is some policy risk," he said. Gold futures for April delivery rose 0.59 percent to $1,232.60 per ounce. U.S. crude futures for March delivery fell 0.2 percent to $53.10 per barrel.  U.S. crude oil futures for March delivery settled down 9 cents at $53.11 a barrel.

(MARIO ANZUONI/REUTERS) Tide laundry detergent, a product distributed by Procter & Gamble, on sale in Pasadena, California. (MARIO ANZUONI/REUTERS) CONSUMER GOODS Procter & Gamble shares jump as activist investor raises hopes of a break-up Add to ... Michael Flaherty and Siddharth Cavale Reuters Published Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2017 11:59AM EST Last updated Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2017 6:41PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Procter & Gamble Co, maker of Tide detergent and Gillette razors, will face ever greater pressure to slice costs and slow-growing divisions now that activist investor Trian Partners is a major shareholder. P&G’s shares hit a two-year high on Wednesday after Trian disclosed a stake in the consumer products behemoth, which is already trying to slim down by selling unprofitable brands. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters that Trian currently holds more than $3 billion of P&G’s stock. Trian has a track record of pressuring large consumer companies to break up, a history that investors and analysts are seizing on with the fund’s newest investment. “While P&G has taken sensible steps to enhance shareholder value recently, the perceived value of a P&G break-up is likely to re-emerge,” Jefferies analyst Kevin Grundy wrote in a note. Bernstein Research said in January 2016 that it conducted a survey of P&G’s institutional investors and found that two-thirds favored a break-up. A break-up could result in its beauty, grooming and healthcare division becoming one company, with P&G separating out everything else, such as its laundry and diaper units. Such a move would result in greater stock returns versus smaller divestitures, Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj said in a note on Wednesday. Cost and revenue benefits from “scale” have been elusive for P&G, he said. Growth in its beauty division has slowed, while baby, feminine and & hygiene products such as Pampers has improved. Among the brands that investment bankers and analysts have said could be sold off are Braun and Clearblue. The company’s paper business may also come under the microscope, which includes Bounty paper towels and Charmin toilet paper, bankers and analysts told Reuters. P&G has been selling off unprofitable brands - including 41 beauty brands to Coty Inc - and focusing on core brands such as Tide, Pampers and Gillette to revive sluggish sales. However, the efforts have failed to boost its stock much beyond where it traded two years ago. TRIAN STAKE Trian, founded in 2005 by Nelson Peltz, Ed Garden and Peter May, focuses mainly on consumer brand companies, industrial firms, and financial companies. The firm has $14-billion in assets under management. Trian Fund Management LP disclosed in a filing on Tuesday that it held 6.4 million shares, worth $556.8-million as of Dec. 31 of last year. That position has grown to more than $3-billion as of Tuesday, the person familiar with the matter told Reuters. Trian declined to comment on Wednesday. P&G Spokesman Damon Jones declined to immediately comment on the break-up speculation on Wednesday. Jones said on Tuesday that P&G welcomes new investors and that the company will continue with its strategy. Some analysts were not convinced about the need for radical changes at P&G. “We see Trian’s P&G stake as late in the company’s turnaround process,” RBC Capital markets analyst Nik Modi wrote. P&G CEO David Taylor has been in place since 2015, making it unlikely that Trian will seek to unseat him given his relatively short time at the company. Mr. Modi said Mr. Taylor is appropriately managing the business and addressing the three major buckets that Trian could address: portfolio alignment, cost and revenues. P&G’s shares were up 3 per cent at $90.52. The stock was the biggest boost to the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

"Following" : "Follow"}} February 15, 2017 11:53am   Comments Share: Related PG Procter & Gamble Sees 'Massive' Volume Following New Peltz Stake 20 Most Talked About Super Bowl LI Commercials, Ranked Dow Strikes New Record High As P&G Rallies, Apple Keeps Rising (Investor's Business Daily) Following Nelson Peltz's Trian picking up a $3.5 billion stake in Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG), Deutsche Bank looked at what the activist investor could do with the consumer products company. A White Paper In The Offing Based on what Trian did with PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE: PEP), analysts Bill Schmitz, Faiza Alwy and Jon Keypour said they expect a white paper, detailing the investment case, including: Strategic and financial benefits of splitting up the company. Exploration of M&A options for the businesses. Productivity and other cost savings opportunities, potentially enabled by new management appointees from outside the company. Related Link: Billionaire Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Holds These 11 Stocks Fundamentals Shaky Despite Cost-Focus Deutsche Bank noted that since Bill Ackman's original involvement with Procter & Gamble in July 2012, the company has been its own activist, at least on the cost front. The motive was to keep activist investors at bay. However, the firm is of the view that absolute and relative organic growth is poor. Market share trends, though improving, have been negative and self-inflicted wounds in big markets like China are unacceptable, the firm added. The firm believes growth challenges require a lot more than celebrity board members and more aggressive cost savings. Deutsche Bank Doesn't See Value In Split Deutsche Bank doesn't see much benefit coming out of a splintering. According to the firm, three $20 billion+ sales businesses are no more agile than one $70 billion business. With the company sharing services infrastructure and other global functions, the firm believes the disynergies associated with a split would far surpass any benefit. While noting that there would be clamor for a split, Deutsche Bank suggested to investors to ask themselves how much value will actually be lost in trying to make the sum of the parts, each with its own cost structure, greater than the whole. According to Deutsche Bank, the best way for Procter & Gamble is to prove its competence to grow its business and not trim more costs or introduce further financial engineering. This recommendation comes against the backdrop of the company already being on its second $10 billion productivity program in less than a decade, with cost structure no longer being a problem as it was earlier. Deutsche Bank has a Hold rating and a $90 price target for the shares of Procter & Gamble. At the time of writing, Procter & Gamble shares were rallying 3.13 percent to $90.59.

"Following" : "Follow"}} February 15, 2017 11:27am   Comments Share: Related AAPL Apple, Alphabet, Panera, Tesla: Fast Money Picks For February 15 Paul Singer's Latest 13F Shows Big Changes In Apple, Western Digital Dow Strikes New Record High As P&G Rallies, Apple Keeps Rising (Investor's Business Daily) Plenty of investors follow the smart money during 13-F filing season. If the managers running billion-dollar hedge funds are all buying or selling the same stock, it may serve as a strong indication that retail investors should be doing the same. However, sometimes the smart money doesn’t necessarily all flow in the same direction. The latest 13-F filings have revealed several of the biggest names on Wall Street still don’t seem to see eye-to-eye on the world’s largest company. Apple In April of 2016, Icahn Enterprises LP (NASDAQ: IEP) chairman Carl Icahn revealed he sold out of his massive 46 million share stake in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL). At the time, Icahn said he was concerned about Apple’s inability to deliver sales growth and its challenging prospects in China.

The exact same quarter Icahn sold his stake in Apple, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-A)’s Warren Buffett and Greenlight Capital’s David Einhorn and were both buying shares. “We believe there is tremendous value in Apple’s brand and growing global customer base that periodically buys new devices and increasingly buys additional services,” Einhorn said at the time. This time, at least, Buffett and Einhorn picked the right side of the trade. Apple shares are up 23 percent since the beginning of April 2016, outpacing the S&P 500 by about 10 percent. Berkshire Hathaway and Greenlight Capital finished 2016 up 24.6 and 8.4 percent, respectively. Icahn Enterprises finished the year down 6.0 percent. New Stakes In the most recent quarter, both Buffett and Einhorn upped their stakes in Apple. Berkshire upped its stake from 15.2 million shares to 574. million shares in Q4. Greenlight added 613,300 shares, bringing its total stake up to more tan 5.8 million shares.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 11:50 PM, February 15, 2017 Updated: 6:20 AM, February 16, 2017 Procter & Gamble Co <PG.N>, maker of Tide detergent and Gillette razors, will face ever greater pressure to slice costs and slow-growing divisions now that activist investor Trian Partners is a major shareholder. P&G's shares hit a two-year high on Wednesday after Trian disclosed a stake in the consumer products company, which is already trying to slim down by selling unprofitable brands. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters that Trian currently holds more than $3 billion of P&G's stock. Trian has a track record of pressuring large consumer companies to break up, a history investors and analysts are seizing on with the fund's newest investment. But Trian has yet to publish a white paper, and the firm's exact plan remains to be seen. In addition to breaking P&G into separate companies, analysts speculated that Trian could press for more brand divestitures and heavy-handed cost overhauls. "Absent a two- or three-way breakup, we suppose Peltz could also call for a 3G-like attack on the company's cost structure," said Don Bilson, director of research at Gordon Haskett, which tracks M&A and activism. Bilson was referring to 3G Capital, a private equity firm that embraces a hard-core cost cutting strategy known as zero-based budgeting. Cincinnati-based P&G is a $225 billion behemoth, selling brands such as Crest toothpaste to consumers across the globe. Bernstein Research said in January 2016 it conducted a survey of P&G's institutional investors and found that two-thirds favored a break-up. A break-up could result in the beauty, grooming and healthcare division becoming one company, with P&G separating out everything else, such as its laundry and diaper units, Bernstein said in the report. Regardless of whether it wants a break-up, Trian is expected to pressure P&G to keep reducing costs while increasing revenues, a mantra it presses all of its companies to embrace. P&G has been selling off unprofitable brands, including 41 beauty brands to Coty Inc <COTY.N>, and focusing on core brands such as Tide, Pampers and Gillette to revive sluggish sales. However, those efforts have failed to boost its stock much beyond where it traded two years ago. Braun, Clearblue, Bounty and Charmin are other brands that Trian could press to be sold, bankers said on Tuesday. P&G's annual meeting is not until October and its deadline to nominate directors expires in June, meaning the company and Trian have several months to negotiate whether or not to give the investor board representation or take the matter to a shareholder vote. P&G's shares were up 3.7 percent at $91.12. The stock was the biggest boost to the Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> on Wednesday but has lagged peers and the S&P 500 index during the past three years. TRIAN Trian, founded in 2005 by Nelson Peltz, Ed Garden and Peter May, focuses mainly on consumer brand companies, industrial firms and financial companies. The firm has $14 billion in assets under management. Trian said in a filing on Tuesday that it held 6.4 million shares, worth $556.8 million as of Dec. 31 of last year. That position has grown to more than $3 billion as of Tuesday, the person familiar with the matter told Reuters, which would make Trian a top 10 shareholder. Trian pressured PepsiCo Inc <PEP.N> to spin off its beverage business from its snacks division, a campaign that the company never heeded though it did hand the investor a board seat in 2015 to make peace. In 2012, under pressure from Trian, Kraft spun off its North American grocery business and its global snack division to become Mondelez International, the maker of Oreos, Cadbury chocolate and Wheat Thins. Trian and P&G declined to comment on Wednesday. "We see Trian's P&G stake as late in the company's turnaround process," RBC Capital markets analyst Nik Modi wrote. Modi said Chief Executive David Taylor is appropriately managing the business and targeting the three major buckets that Trian could address: portfolio alignment, cost and revenues.

US consumer inflation in January jumped by the largest amount in four years, and the 0.6 per cent increase was the third consecutive monthly acceleration. Retail sales for the same period rose 0.4 per cent, better than analysts had forecast. About 15 minutes into trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at 20,533.93, up 0.1 per cent. The broad-based S&P 500 was down a hair at 2,337.23, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.1 per cent at 5,785.48. US stocks have closed at records the last four days. P&G jumped 3.3 per cent on news that activist investor Trian Fund Management led by Nelson Peltz holds 6.4 million shares worth US$575 million in the consumer products giant, according to a securities filing. Some news reports said Trian has added to the stake since the filing deadline and now holds more than US$3 billion in shares. Trian is known for pushing companies to reorganize businesses and return funds to shareholders. Airline shares were lifted by news that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway boosted investments in American Airlines, United Continental and Delta Air lines.

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Procter & Gamble Co , maker of Tide detergent and Gillette razors, will face ever greater pressure to slice costs and slow-growing divisions now that activist investor Trian Partners is a major shareholder. P&G's shares hit a two-year high on Wednesday after Trian disclosed a stake in the consumer products company, which is already trying to slim down by selling unprofitable brands. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters that Trian currently holds more than US$3 billion of P&G's stock. Trian has a track record of pressuring large consumer companies to break up, a history investors and analysts are seizing on with the fund's newest investment. But Trian has yet to publish a white paper, and the firm's exact plan remains to be seen. In addition to breaking P&G into separate companies, analysts speculated that Trian could press for more brand divestitures and heavy-handed cost overhauls. "Absent a two- or three-way breakup, we suppose Peltz could also call for a 3G-like attack on the company's cost structure," said Don Bilson, director of research at Gordon Haskett, which tracks M&A and activism. Bilson was referring to 3G Capital, a private equity firm that embraces a hard-core cost cutting strategy known as zero-based budgeting. Cincinnati-based P&G is a US$225 billion behemoth, selling brands such as Crest toothpaste to consumers across the globe. Bernstein Research said in January 2016 it conducted a survey of P&G's institutional investors and found that two-thirds favored a break-up. A break-up could result in the beauty, grooming and healthcare division becoming one company, with P&G separating out everything else, such as its laundry and diaper units, Bernstein said in the report. Regardless of whether it wants a break-up, Trian is expected to pressure P&G to keep reducing costs while increasing revenues, a mantra it presses all of its companies to embrace. P&G has been selling off unprofitable brands, including 41 beauty brands to Coty Inc , and focusing on core brands such as Tide, Pampers and Gillette to revive sluggish sales. However, those efforts have failed to boost its stock much beyond where it traded two years ago. Braun, Clearblue, Bounty and Charmin are other brands that Trian could press to be sold, bankers said on Tuesday. P&G's annual meeting is not until October and its deadline to nominate directors expires in June, meaning the company and Trian have several months to negotiate whether or not to give the investor board representation or take the matter to a shareholder vote. P&G's shares were up 3.7 percent at US$91.12. The stock was the biggest boost to the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday but has lagged peers and the S&P 500 index during the past three years.

That position has grown to more than US$3 billion as of Tuesday, the person familiar with the matter told Reuters, which would make Trian a top 10 shareholder. Trian pressured PepsiCo Inc to spin off its beverage business from its snacks division, a campaign that the company never heeded though it did hand the investor a board seat in 2015 to make peace. In 2012, under pressure from Trian, Kraft spun off its North American grocery business and its global snack division to become Mondelez International, the maker of Oreos, Cadbury chocolate and Wheat Thins. Trian and P&G declined to comment on Wednesday. "We see Trian's P&G stake as late in the company's turnaround process," RBC Capital markets analyst Nik Modi wrote. Modi said Chief Executive David Taylor is appropriately managing the business and targeting the three major buckets that Trian could address: portfolio alignment, cost and revenues.

"Following" : "Follow"}} February 15, 2017 9:38am   Comments Share: Related PG 20 Most Talked About Super Bowl LI Commercials, Ranked Which Super Bowl LI Commercials Were Social Hits? Stock Futures Mixed; Will Bulls Stick Around For Another Day? (Investor's Business Daily) Trian Fund Management LP took a $3.5 billion stake in Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG) Tuesday night and pushed shares to a two-year peak above $91.5. It’s the largest position the activist investor has ever taken in a company, and it’s the second time in five years that P&G has been targeted by such an investor. In 2012, Pershing Square Capital Management took a stake to push for the departure of then CEO Robert McDonald. Pershing sold its shares after McDonald left in 2014. P&G spokesperson Damon Jones told Reuters the company had been unaware of Trian’s position prior to the filing, and the firm’s intention is yet unclear. The Market’s Surprising Reaction Trader Dennis Dick called the ensuing market activity “unbelievable.” “This is Procter & Gamble,” Dick said on Benzinga’s Pre-Market Prep morning show. “What are they going to sell? I just can’t believe you’re going to tack on $3 or $4 just because Peltz took a stake in it. It doesn’t make sense.” Related Link: The Market In 5 Minutes He said the activity merited maybe a $1 boost. “They’re going to tack on $10 billion in market cap because [Trian Founder Nelson] Peltz took a $3 billion position?” he said. “This market, man, trying to figure it out logically sometimes is nearly impossible.” While the buy was big for Peltz, Dick said the percentage of ownership is fairly insignificant. The firm essentially bought 1.56 percent of the $225 billion market-cap company. But investors reacted so forcefully that the trader suspected news along the lines of a takeover. “I’m seeing the Peltz headline, but I’m like it’s gotta be something else,” he said. “They must have increased their dividend, or must be something with the company — nothing. It was all just on that new position, which isn’t even sizeable, just one percent of the company, guys. That seems crazy.” P&G generally trades with daily volume averaging 8 million, but Dick said hundreds of thousands of shares traded Tuesday night, and he speculated that 13Fs were the cause. “They’re chasing so much with these 13Fs because these are just closed over the last 45 days,” he said. “Some of these positions could’ve been bought 45 days ago.” The stock seemed to have hit its peak and has waned in pre-market trading. With 2 billion shares outstanding, shares are trading around $87.80.

By DavidBenoit SharonTerlep One of the biggest activist investors has built up a more than $3 billion stake in Procter & Gamble Co., adding urgency to the consumer-product giant’s efforts to turn around its business and boost its stock price. Trian Fund Management LP, which in previous years has targeted companies like PepsiCo Inc. PEP, -0.18%   and DuPont Co. DUP, +0.33%  , disclosed Tuesday it had bought shares in P&G PG, +3.71%  , which has a market value of $225 billion. Trian’s bet, at more than $3 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter, is its largest investment ever. It’s unclear what changes Trian, which is known for publishing detailed research reports on its investment targets, will seek at the maker of Tide detergent, Gillette razors and Pampers diapers. “P&G welcomes investment in our company,” the Cincinnati company said, after The Wall Street Journal first reported on Trian’s investment Tuesday. Shares of the company, which have lagged behind the broader market for the past year, jumped 3% in late trading to $90.40. P&G has been slashing costs and shedding dozens of brands to refocus on its biggest businesses. But it has struggled to boost sales growth as it battles a sluggish global economy, price pressures and competition from internet upstarts like the Dollar Shave Club.

President Trump met with some of the country’s top retailers this morning and continued expressions of support for more business-friendly policies and big tax cuts fueled investors risk appetite.

WTI crude oil for March delivery settled at $53.11 a barrel, down about 0.2% on the day following another big addition to the nation’s crude oil stockpiles.

"Facebook could easily become the world's largest entertainment company, one that is worthy of a far higher multiple than it gets," the "Mad Money" host said. The same goes for Apple, Cramer said. Analysts who tell the story of Apple are looking at it as if it is some sort of dead end of innovation. Yet they are forgetting that the iPhone device has a steady built-in stream of revenue that continues to grow. Cramer found this to be reminiscent of Gillette, with users paying a fortune for razors over the span of their lifetime. Hence, Trian, the investment firm run by Nelson Peltz, announced a hefty stake in Proctor & Gamble. "If we looked at Apple through the same lens as Gillette, it might very well be the best stock a man can get," Cramer said. Rafael Marchante | Reuters Cramer is sick and tired of investors doubting that the stock market could really power higher. It is the real deal, he said, and he decided to prove it. "It is one of the oldest theories when it comes to stocks that the transports have to confirm the strength in the Dow industrials before you can trust a rally … that is exactly what is happening," Cramer said. The theory of transports pertains to the notion that the transports group must make a new high at the same time as the Dow for the market to have solid grounding. Copper is often used as a barometer for the health of the global economy. Naturally, Jim Cramer's interest was naturally piqued when the red metal made a big breakout to the upside recently. "Copper's strength is part of the traditional metrics that define economic growth and it can be a part of the rational justification for what so many believe is an irrational rally," Cramer said. When demand for copper increases, that means industrial activity is on the rise because copper is used to make a wide array of things from new factories, to new houses and automobiles. However, Cramer did note that he doesn't know if demand has increased because there have been major production cuts, which could signal the jump is supply driven rather than due to stronger demand. Most investors probably don't associate General Electric with technology, but CEO Jeff Immelt is now wagering a bet that it can become a top 10 software company by 2020. "The proof of the pudding is reality. Our orders are growing 25 percent a year. We are kind of first among equals in the industrial internet. We can play. We can do this," Immelt said. When GE began investing in technology, Immelt said he didn't do so with the notion that it had to become a software company. Instead, the industrial assets that the company sells are surrounded by sensors and produce a massive amount of data. It was simply an investment to protect its installed base. Cramer also got the take of the future of digital from Adobe Systems' CEO Shantanu Narayen. Adobe is the leading maker of digital media and marketing software. Adobe has steadily transformed itself in the last few years into more of a cloud computing play. The company also made strides to enter the red-hot field of artificial intelligence with Sensei, its AI platform that uses machine learning to help computers match images and understand both the meaning and sentiment of documents. Narayen told Cramer that the future of video also could mean more monetization of the content. "There is more content that is out there than there has ever been before, and this revival of content when coupled with the appropriate advertising — that is going to be the business model that evolves on the web," Narayan said.

All the major averages notched a new record high to boot. As a result, it’s not been nearly 90 days since investors had to suffer so much as a 1% decline. Life is hard, you know. In the end, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5%, the S&P 500 wafted up 0.5%, the Nasdaq Composite added 0.6% and the Russell 2000 gained 0.5%. Treasury bonds were weaker across the curve, the dollar was lower, gold gained 0.6% and oil was weaker finishing with a 0.2% loss. Healthcare stocks led the way with a 1.2% gain with consumer staples and financials following. Utilities, energy and REITs were the laggards. Groupon Inc (NASDAQ:GRPN) surged 23.3% thanks to a fourth-quarter earnings beat with revenues 2% ahead of estimates. Sodastream International Ltd (NASDAQ:SODA) gained 4.6% on a top- and bottom-line beat with sales in Western Europe a bright spot. Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) rose 3.7% after Nelson Peltz’s Trian Fund Management disclosed a $3.5 billion stake, the largest ever position in a company for the activist investor. PG has had trouble recently as its efforts to streamline have failed to move the stock. Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE:LUV) gained 3.6% after 13F filings showed Warren Buffett accumulating a position. On the downside, Fossil Group Inc (NASDAQ:FOSL) fell 14.8% after a messy Q4 report with below-consensus revenues and weak profit margins as watch sales remain soft and the “Wearables Revolution” has been a disappointment. LendingClub Corp (NYSE:LC) fell 4.7% on slightly better Q4 results as investors worried about weaker-than-expected loan originations and weak forward guidance. A batch of strong economic data seemed to be the main catalyst for the day, confirming real growth and inflation is heating up. Headline retail sales rose 0.4% in January over December pushing the annual rise to levels not seen since 2014. Headline consumer price inflation jumped 0.6% month-over-month — double the expected gain — for the hottest print since February 2013. On an annual basis, inflation is rising at a 2.5% clip (hottest since March 2012) putting increasing pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again. And finally, the February Empire State manufacturing survey increased to its strongest print since September 2014. On the political front, attention was paid to President Trump’s reiteration that his tax reform plans are forthcoming and would “substantially” lower rates for consumers and businesses. While stocks remain in melt up mode, further evidence of vulnerabilities appeared today as the CBOE Volatility Index (INDEXCBOE:VIX), known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge” since it reflects options premium pricing, rose 11.5%. Normally, when stocks rise the VIX falls.

By Nicole Rojas February 15, 2017 23:38 GMT Close Co-op bank up for sale after turnaround stalled IBTimesUK/Wochit US stocks continued on an upward trend Wednesday (15 February), closing at record highs for a fifth straight session. All three major indices posted the longest record-setting streak since January 1992 following President Donald Trump's promise of a "massive" tax plan. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 107.45 points, or 0.5%, to settle at 20,611.86. Gains in the blue chip gauge were led by Procter & Gamble Co, whose shares rose 3.7% after investor Trian Fund Management LP revealed a $3bn stake in the company, MarketWatch reported. CNBC noted that official filings released Tuesday (14 February) showed a number of US hedge fund investors transferred significant parts of their portfolios into the financial and pharmaceutical sectors. The S&P 500 index rose 11.67 points, or 0.5%, to finish at 2,349.25. A rise of nearly 1.2% in healthcare stocks led the S&P higher at the close of the session. The financials sector also contributed to gains, rising 0.7% on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite gained 36.87 points, or 0.6%, to end at 5,819.44. MarketWatch reported the tech-heavy index closed at a record for a seventh session in a row, marking the longest similar streak since 27 December 1999. Trump's comments on Wednesday echoed those made earlier in February when he promised to deliver a "phenomenal" tax plan. The president said that his administration is "focused on the issues that will bring economic growth. That's what we're all about." In economic news, the consumer price index (CPI) gained a more-than-expected 0.6% in January, CNBC reported. Retail sales also rose at a faster pace than what was expected, gaining 0.4% in January. Following the inflation report, economist at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan raised their expectations of a rate hike for March or May. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen testified in front of Congress on Tuesday and raised expectations for a rate hike in March, saying it would be "unwise" for the Fed to delay. Gold futures for April delivery rose $7.40 to settle at $1,233.10 an ounce. Meanwhile US crude oil for March delivery dropped $0.09 to $53.11 a barrel. The dollar moved lower against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.06 and the yen 114.1 against the greenback. US Treasury yields jumped after the data releases, with the short-term two-year yield at 1.26% and the 10-year yield climbing above 2.5%.

Finance Search US stocks end at records again, lifting global equitiesAFP – 21 hours ago Wall Street stocks pushed to fresh highs for the fifth day in a row Wednesday, giving a boost to most international equity markets on continued optimism about US economic prospects. US stocks have been on a tear since last week when President Donald Trump vowed to release details of his promised tax cut plan within two to three weeks. On Wednesday, Trump reiterated that he would soon release specifics on the plan. Sentiment was further lifted by a hopeful outlook from US Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and solid US data on retail sales and consumer spending. All of these things lended confidence to the view that the Fed would soon raise interest rates, a positive for financial stocks. Besides New York, equity markets rose in London, Frankfurt, Paris and Tokyo, which gained 1.0 percent. Market "bullishness stems from hawkish testimony by Janet Yellen... giving a fillip to a key financial sector whose profitability benefits from higher interest rates", said Accendo Markets analyst Mike van Dulken. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich said, "It feels like investors might get the pro-growth part of the platform." He added that mounting questions about Trump's connections to Russia so far are not rattling investors. Among individual stocks Procter & Gamble jumped 3.7 percent on news that activist investor Trian Fund Management led by Nelson Peltz holds 6.4 million shares worth $575 million in the consumer products giant, according to a securities filing. Some news reports said Trian has added to the stake since the filing deadline and now holds more than $3 billion in shares. Trian is known for pushing companies to reorganize businesses and return funds to shareholders. Shares in troubled conglomerate Toshiba plunged almost nine percent -- extending Tuesday's eight percent decline -- after warning it faced a 390 billion yen ($3.4 billion) loss in the fiscal year to March, hit by a 700 billion yen writedown at its US nuclear unit Westinghouse. The news prompted its chairman to resign while it also hinted at another accounting scandal following a profit-padding crisis in 2015. - Key figures around 2200 GMT - New York - Dow: UP 0.5 percent at 20,611.86 (close) New York - S&P 500: UP 0.5 percent at 2,349.25 (close) New York - Nasdaq: UP 0.6 percent at 5,819.44 (close) London - FTSE 100: UP 0.5 percent at 7,302.41 (close) Frankfurt - DAX 30: UP 0.2 percent at 11,793.93 (close) Paris - CAC 40: UP 0.6 percent at 4,924.86 (close) EURO STOXX 50: UP 0.6 percent at 3,327.44 (close) Tokyo - Nikkei 225: UP 1.0 percent at 19,437.98 (close) Hong Kong - Hang Seng: UP 1.2 percent at 23,994.87 (close) Shanghai - Composite: DOWN 0.2 percent at 3,212.99 (close) Euro/dollar: UP at $1.0602 from $1.0576 Pound/dollar: DOWN at $1.2459 from $1.2466 Dollar/yen: DOWN at 114.18 yen from 114.27 yen Oil - Brent North Sea: DOWN 22 cents at $55.75 per barrel Oil - West Texas Intermediate: DOWN 9 cents at $53.11 Explore Related Content 1 - 1 of 1 prevnext Las mejores ciudades del mundo para estudiantes Top Stories » Trump proposes stricter Obamacare rulesAAP The Trump administration has proposed changes to the Obamacare individual insurance market that insurers have said … Ten warns of an earnings lossAAP Trump meets retail CEOs on border tax planAAP Star lifts profit despite high roller hitAAP Sponsored  On This Site HOME NEWS & OPINION TAX TIME 2016 INVESTING MY PORTFOLIOS PERSONAL FINANCE VIDEO Expert Opinion ALSO ON YAHOO7 Mail Stocks & Shares Forum Meet Single Women Meet Single Men TV Guide Easy Recipe Ideas Go Travelling Tips To Great Sex Breaking News Find Your Dream Car Weather Forecast Find A Job All Yahoo7 Services » Trending Now NBN Gerard Baden Clay Car insurance comparison Rolf Harris Sports bet James McGowan Travel insurance comparison Kim Jong Nam Car insurance quote Flynn leaks Help / Suggestions Privacy Terms Quotes are real-time for NASDAQ, NYSE, and NYSEAmex when available.

Close share panel Image copyright Tupperware Image caption Tupperware parties are no longer polite gatherings over tea and cake, but have been updated to "a girls' night out" When I meet Tupperware Brands boss Rick Goings there's a funny moment. He's just finished his lunch, but wants to pack the remainder away for later. He looks expectantly at his colleague, expecting her to magic a box out of thin air. "What, you think I've got some in my handbag?" she scoffs. You can tell Mr Goings is slightly disappointed. The King of Tupperware hasn't got any at just the moment he needs some. Yet, despite being in Switzerland, thousands of miles away from the firm's headquarters in Orlando, Florida, it's not an unreasonable expectation that Tupperware's products may indeed be available. For while Tupperware may, in the UK at least, be forever associated with a bygone era when women stayed at home and men went to work, it's now a thriving international juggernaut. "We do not look at ourselves as a US company," says Mr Goings. Image copyright Tupperware Image caption Rick Goings says the firm now targets countries "where most of the people in the world live" And you can see why. Sales last year were $2.2bn (£1.8bn) with Asia-Pacific responsible for almost a third of these, while the biggest sales growth was seen in Brazil. The firm's products - which now include not only Tupperware, but also several beauty brands - are sold in more than 80 countries, and for the past five years, more than 90% of sales have come from non-US markets. It's a revolution Mr Goings has driven. When he became chief executive in 1997, the firm had already expanded overseas, but was failing. In his first week at the helm he had to write off $100m of bad debt. "So much was broken," he says about the company, founded in 1946 by inventor Earl Tupper. His solution was to ramp up the firm's expansion overseas, in particular focusing on Latin America, Asia and Africa and eventually taking the firm to more than 20 additional countries. He says this shift in focus was obvious, given that Europe and the US combined account for just a tenth of the world's population overall. "We didn't have to make major changes to our business model and it's where most of the people in the world live," he says. Image copyright Tupperware Image caption A recommendation from a friend is always likely to be more persuasive than one from a company, according to McKinsey Many big consumer brands from Coca-Cola to Procter & Gamble have followed similar paths into emerging markets, tapping into a growing middle class and strong demand for well-known US brands. Yet Tupperware's model of direct selling - the famed suburban housewives' gathering of the 1950s and 1960s - is exactly the thing that has given it an edge. While easy to mock - do modern women really get excited about plastic boxes? - it's enabled the firm to get around all the problems of trying to sell in regions where infrastructure is less developed and shops can be a long distance away. The firm hasn't had to invest in shops, and instead of travelling into town, people can nip over to a friend's house to buy things. And while the party attendees may start off as housewives, they're unlikely to stay that way, according to Mr Goings. For many of the firm's 3.1 million casual sales consultants, it has provided their first chance of an independent income. Typically a party will yield about $400 (£320) worth of sales, of which the sales consultant will earn 30%. "It's a heck of a lot of money," Mr Goings says. Image copyright Tupperware Image caption Working for Tupperware has enabled Indonesian Ng Chiu Gwek to educate her three children overseas Ng Chiu Gwek, one of Tupperware's most successful Indonesian sales force members, who joined the company in 1997, says she loves the firm. "I have changed my own life into a better life, going from nothing into something," she says. Previously a full-time housewife, Ms Gwek - who was introduced to the firm by her mother-in-law - now runs a distributorship, responsible for a team of several thousand sales consultants in her hometown of Pontianak and the surrounding small cities. The job has enabled her to educate all three of her children overseas. "Tupperware is my life and I have not seen any other company like Tupperware that has changed so many lives for the better," she says. Image copyright Tupperware Image caption A Tupperware party is held somewhere in the world every 1.3 seconds, the firm claims A shake-up of the party format has also helped drive growth. They are no longer polite gatherings over tea and cake, but have been updated to "a girls' night out", says Mr Goings with a conspiratorial nod. Themes include Mexican night with tequila, and decadent and delicious desserts and meals, with one such party held every 1.3 seconds globally, the firm claims. In some countries, where small homes mean space for hosting gatherings is limited, the firm has opened so-called "experience studios", where would-be customers can see the products in action. In China it has 5,600 such spaces, but reckons there's capacity for 20,000. The firm's sales model has another advantage. A recommendation from a friend is always likely to be more persuasive than one from a company, but in emerging markets this is particularly so, according to McKinsey. The management consultancy found consumers in Africa and Asia were far more dependent on word of mouth, than their developed counterparts. It said this was because with few brands around long enough to have built a loyal following, seeing a friend use a product was reassuring. It's also tough for counterfeiters - and those making cheaper imitations of the products - to imitate this kind of sales network. Image copyright Studio Peck,LLC 2015 40773323 Image caption The firm's airtight storage boxes that wowed Western consumers in the postwar years now account for just a third of sales Neil Saunders, managing director at consultancy Globaldata Retail, says while in developed markets like the UK the firm's long history means Tupperware is seen as a bit old-fashioned compared to more modern rivals such as Joseph Joseph, in emerging markets it doesn't carry this "baggage". "For consumers there it's a modern innovative brand. It's a challenger and innovator," he says. And as Mr Goings is at pains to point out while handing me the firm's brochure, the airtight storage boxes that wowed Western consumers in the postwar years now account for just a third of sales. Instead it is now brightly coloured microwaveable pressure cookers, mini food processors and water bottles that are driving sales. "The party has changed, the product has changed. We're not just a plastic box company," he says.

This could result in a bearish double-top back to 7270 which sees the index breach an imperfect February uptrend’s support at 7280. Bulls looking for a break back above 7285 to rekindle optimism. Bears desire a test of yesterday’s 7270 post-close lows. Watch levels: Bullish 7285, Bearish 7270. Calls for a negative European open come in spite of another record stateside close and global equities attaining their best since May 2015, still buoyed by hopes of Trump reflation, tax cuts, bank deregulation and US monetary policy normalisation while decent US data prints help out too. After rallying on US rate hike hopes, a USD pullback from 1-month highs has delivered hindering FX strength elsewhere producing a mixed bag for Asian equities overnight. A Yen bounce is holding back Japan’s Nikkei along with persistent weakness for Toshiba. Australia’s ASX is higher after decent jobs data and oil prices finding their feet despite yet another US inventory build and production increase (pattern developing? Short covering? OPEC cuts?). Miners supported by base metals holding up, precious metals even rallying on a combination of weaker USD and technicals (bullish flags). China and Hong Kong equities outperform without clear drivers. US equity markets closed at record highs for the fifth day in a row as investor optimism continues to build, with yesterday’s drivers including much stronger than expected inflation and retail sales data, tax cut hopes, Fed Chair Yellen reiterating her hawkish outlook and an eruption of bullishness in Healthcare as a leading fund manager took a $3.5bn stake in Dow component Procter & Gamble. This helped the Dow Jones strengthen by 0.5%, a mark mirrored by the S&P 500, while the Nasdaq and Russell 2000 outperformed, up 0.6% and 0.7% respectively. Crude Oil prices are beginning to tick lower this morning, having held flat overnight despite a larger than expected build in US Crude inventories that initially sent prices higher before paring gains shortly afterwards. Both US and Brent crude remain hampered by week long falling highs resistance, with the former benchmark back below $53 while Brent holds above $55.50. Gold is trading marginally higher this morning having fallen from overnight highs, as a weaker US dollar boosts demand for commodities. Having briefly touched $1237 while the dollar was at its weakest level before paring gains, the precious metal has now found support at $1233 intersecting support, with further movements in FX space likely to drive investor sentiment today - as has been the case throughout the week. In focus today, on a light day for macro data, will most likely be the plethora of European speakers while the meeting of G20 Foreign Ministers takes place in Berlin. The latter will likely provide an ongoing commentary throughout the day concerning recent major geopolitical events - North Korea, Brexit and Trump - as messrs BoJo (UK), Rex-T (US) and their Russian counterpart Lavrov meet for the first time. Other highlights include German Chancellor Merkel and Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau at a joint conference (coinciding with European Parliament approving the EU-Canada trade deal yesterday), the ECB’s Nowotny and Coeure shortly after the release of the ECB Minutes from January’s policy meeting at 12:30pm, while EU President Juncker and the Fed’s Williams both speak after the European market close. Datawise, today is limited to a single dump of US data at 1:30pm, with January Housing Starts and Building Permits seen flat, Jobless Claims (Initial forecast higher, Continuing expected lower) and the Philly Fed Business Outlook (Feb) falling back to 18 from January’s 3-year high of 23.6.

Releasing the report, Khosla highlighted to advertisers the importance of truthful advertising. He said, “Truthful advertising is not only the right thing to do, but also great for the business.” Key findings: • Growth in the Indian advertising market slowed down to 12.5 per cent in 2016, thanks to the tsunami that hit in the form of demonetisation. Demonetisation knocked off Rs. 1,650 crore from ADEX in November and December 2016. Growth in 2015 over 2014 was as high as 17.6 per cent. • The ADEX growth in the first half of the year was slow at 13 per cent, but accelerated to 16 per cent by October 2016, before 'de-growing' in November and December 2016 by eight per cent. • Growth came mainly on the back of  Digital, which grew by 40 per cent plus, and now stands at Rs. 7,315 crore, 15 per cent of the market. •  Growth in traditional media (all media other than digital), slowed down to 8.5 per cent. • he dominant category continues to be FMCG contributing 32per cent, followed by Auto at 10 per cent and Telecom 8 per cent. E-Commerce that had taken ADEX (only TV + Print + Radio) by storm in 2015, contributed only 4 per cent in 2016. • TV grew by 9 per cent and print only by 7 per cent in 2016. • Radio stood out with a growth rate of 13.2per cent although on a small base. • Nearly 50 per cent of Print’s growth of Rs. 1,216 crore is accounted by only four categories FMCG, Auto, Education and BFSI. Nearly 44 per cent of TV growth of Rs. 1,570 crore is accounted by FMCG. • Advertising continues to be a Big Boys’ game with the largest spender HUL spending approximately Rs. 2,500 crore and top 10 spenders accounting for 16 per cent of the total market and contributing 45 per cent of the top 50 list. • Unilever, Amazon and Procter & Gamble continue to be the top three advertisers. • Many new entrants entered the Elite top 50 list like Patanjali, OPPO Mobiles, Nissan Motors, Reliance JIO, Vivo Phone, SBI and Videocon. Says Madison World chairman Sam Balsara, “Our expectation is that the market will grow 13.5 per cent in 2017, but growth rates will vary widely from month to month.We expect the market to grow by just 8 per cent for the period January to April 2017, 14 per cent from May to October 2017 and 24 per cent in November and December 2017, given that market had 'de-grown' by 8 per cent in November and December 2016. Our optimism for good growth in ADEX starting May comes on the back of several govt initiatives- from high government investment in infrastructure, lower corporate and personal taxes for small and medium companies and the masses, good government support for the poor and consequently the wide scale expectation of yet another year of high GDP growth.” In the current environment, Madison advises: 1. Take Advantage of weaker January-April months and intensify campaigns to get good Impact during this period. 2. Use Digital, but less for top of Funnel Awareness and more for Mid/Bottom Funnel Consideration, Leads and Advocacy. 3. Don’t become a slave to Media Ratings / Readership Data. Ride it and use it as a Guide, Not as a Crutch. • The original forecast for February 2016 was 16.8 per cent which was brought down to 13.2 per cent in August 2016. The projection now for 2017 is 13.5 per cent. tags TV adsCrompton GreavesAdExShantanu Khosla Trending Balaji Telefilms reports operating profit for third quarter Adex 17: TV to contribute 45pc, FTA to aid 8pc growth rate, says GroupM Shifting to green tech: TRAI extends ideas date till 14 March Nazara Games to invest $20 million in eSports, league planned IPR: DIPP allocation increased after copyright shift from HRD   Latest Reads Alpenliebe TVC portrays small moments of joy in everyday life Alpenliebe Gold, the flagship candy brand of Perfetti Van Melle India, has launched a heart-warming new communication campaign - chhoti chhoti khushiyon ke liye.

Business U.S. Chamber of Commerce Hosts Nigerian Trade Minister as Both Agree to Work Together By Press Release - February 16, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter United States of America, February 15, 2017/ — The U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s U.S.-Africa Business Center Tuesday hosted the Nigerian Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment Dr. Okechukwu Enelamah (www.FMITI.gov.ng) for a roundtable discussion with U.S. business executives at their office in Washington, D.C. The conversation focused on enhancing trade and investment relationship between both countries. This comes in the context of a telephone call between President Muhammadu Buhari and President Donald Trump Monday, where both Presidents discussed security and economic issues. It is seen as suggesting the U.S. consideration of Nigeria as a strategic partner. “The U.S. has historically been one of Nigeria’s top trading partners; it was the biggest importer of Nigeria’s crude oil at some point. In the last five years, however, the sharp decline in U.S. imports of our crude, on account of rising domestic production of shale, has altered the trade balance between our two countries. This development presents Nigeria with a good opportunity for diversification and to explore and increase non-oil export – especially in agricultural products, services and the digital economy,” said Minister Enelamah. On his part, the President of the U.S.-Africa Business Center and Vice President for African Affairs at the Chamber Scott Eisner, stated that “With the largest economy in Africa, Nigeria is an important partner for U.S. businesses. Our conversation highlighted the work being done to strengthen the economic relationship between our two countries and how we can continue to build on this relationship.” Enelamah also participated in a Facebook Live conversation with the U.S.-Africa Business Center following the roundtable. Some of the companies that attended the gathering include Google, Microsoft, Blackstone, Procter and Gamble, UPS, Johnson and Johnson, Boston Scientific, Philip Morris International, Lekoil Oil, ITIC, etc. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is the world’s largest business federation representing the interests of more than 3 million businesses of all sizes, sectors, and regions, as well as state and local chambers and industry associations. Its International Affairs division includes more than 70 regional and policy experts and 25 country-and region-specific business councils and initiatives. The U.S. Chamber also works closely with 117 American Chambers of Commerce abroad. The U.S.-Africa Business Center is the preeminent voice in the global business community advocating for increased trade between the United States and Africa. After the roundtable, the Minister went on to attend events focusing on the Ease of Doing Business and Investment at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and the Hudson Institute. He answered questions from a mixed audience of business executives, government officials, diplomats and others. He similarly had meetings at the State Department with the outgoing Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Linda Thomas Greenfield and U.S. Trade Representatives for Africa at the Commerce office. Issues on the agenda at the state department ranged from the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), SMEs, Nigeria’s leadership on the Continent and continued engagement with the new administration, while the commerce office focused on trade and the WTO. Minister Enelamah was accompanied by his Trade Adviser and Chief Negotiator Ambassador Chiedu Osakwe, Special Adviser Bunmi Adeoye and Strategic Communications Adviser, Constance C. Ikokwu.

Ask any business owner a few months after they have completed their strategy, what is the biggest problem they face. You will get exactly the same answer from both. The strategy is not being executed. According to Professor Richard Rumelt of UCLA, there are only two types of strategy, “good strategy and bad strategy.” (He is the author of a book by the same name, reviewed in this column in 2012.) The strategy method described at the beginning of this book would fall into Rumelt’s definition of bad strategy, and I wouldn’t read this book for Part I. That said, it is a valuable guide on how to ensure your strategy is executed. The execution comes from your leader’s ability to integrate the strategy into their leadership method. Many good leaders I have met have never considered this issue, and many senior managers have never thought about what it would take to do so. Authors Harbir Singh and Michael Useem of Wharton Business School have formulated this process into six steps. The first step is the realisation of the connection between leadership and strategy. As a guest at a barbecue one weekend, I was asked what I did for a living. I replied that I am a strategist, to which one of the guests responded that his firm had recently gone through just such a process. I asked him how it was going and he replied: “We are so busy with our regular work, we simply haven’t had the time to even think about the strategy.” One has to wonder what the regular work could possibly be, except trying to execute the strategy! That is the beginning of Singh and Useem’s prescription for strategic leadership: integrating strategy and leadership. Strategic leadership is being clear what the strategy is so you can make choices of where to play and how to win, how to prioritise goals, and to ensure you have the human capabilities necessary to achieve these goals. “Integrating the two areas calls for a continuous and simultaneous discussion of both strategy and leadership questions,” the authors exhort. The key word here is “continuous”: the discussion of leadership and strategy at every opportunity. The continuous discussions are around the positions of the organisation to meet the strategy, and whether you still have the right people and architecture in place. Strategy must be taught The second step on the strategy leader’s roadmap is the acknowledgement that neither strategy nor leadership is a natural skill set; it must be taught. Academic research, borne out by management practice, has identified several ways this type of development can be achieved. Possibly the most effective is a combination of formal learning, one-on-one coaching and exposure to instructive experience. These experiences are chosen for the opportunity they offer to force the candidate to apply the learning and coaching if he or she is to succeed. Formal learning, one-on-one coaching and exposure to instructive experience is a powerful combination. This approach has been behind the success of General Electric, Boeing, American Express, IBM, and Procter & Gamble. And it doesn’t require deep pockets, only determination from senior leadership and the board. The third step to ensuring the strategy is executed is by identifying the strategic fit between the current managers and the particular challenges the incumbent will face. The executive must have the temperament and relevant experience that aligns with the specific imperatives of the firm at the moment. If they don’t, then the second step, development, as described above becomes necessary and if that fails, another leader must be sought. This process entails pinpointing the priority skills the leader requires through careful and detailed analysis, not coffee table discussion. The fourth step is to convey the strategic intent (or what I call your ‘functional strategy’) – how you have to function to achieve the strategic outcomes in a dynamic and fast-changing business environment. “Managers at all levels must also be able to convey strategic intent if they are to effectively exercise strategic leadership”, the authors explain. The fifth step is to see leadership in layers. Once the most senior leaders have absorbed the strategy, it is up to them to cascade it down to the next level with such clarity that this level can do the same to the level below, and onward. The last step is to “decide deliberatively”, that is to use the strategy to guide each and every decision, under all circumstances, and every time. No exceptions. These six steps will ensure that your strategy is executed. They will ensure your expenditure of time, effort and money in your strategy yields a strong return. That does however presuppose your strategy is a good one.

Updated 6 hours ago Wall Street pushed further into record-high territory Wednesday, with the S&P 500 notching a seven-session winning streak, helped by a round of robust economic data and ongoing optimism that President Trump will cut corporate taxes. Bigger-than-expected rises in retail sales and consumer prices in January reinforced confidence that the economy is growing at a solid pace following the strongest quarterly corporate earnings growth in over two years. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 11.67 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,349.25. It's the seventh straight gain for the index and its longest winning streak in three and a half years. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 107.45 points, or 0.5 percent, to 20,611.86. The Nasdaq composite rose 36.87, or 0.6 percent, to 5,819.44. Seven stocks rose on the New York Stock Exchange for every five that fell. In a meeting with top executives from retail companies, Trump said he would lower taxes substantially and simplify the tax code, echoing a vow he made last week and on the campaign trail. The president has provided scant details about his own tax overhaul, but said people will “love” his planned tax reforms. He assured retail CEOs that tax rates would be lowered and simplified in a “massive” plan that “will be submitted in the not too distant future.” Optimism that lower taxes and corporate deregulation will expand the economy pushed the three major indexes to all-time highs. The S&P 500 recorded its fifth straight record close and its longest non-stop winning streak since September 2013, even as some investors worried that Trump so far has provided no substantial details of his tax plan. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, stood by the stance she took on Tuesday that the U.S. central bank was on track to raise interest rates at an upcoming policy meeting. “A year ago, if Janet Yellen had come out with the statement she made, the market would have freaked out because the fundamentals were very soft,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network. “Now, if the Fed raises rates, it's not going to shake the world because people are confident enough about the fundamentals.” The health care index was the top gainer, up 1.17 percent. Financial stocks, which benefit from higher rates, rose 0.74 percent. The utilities and real estate sectors, both of which do worse in high-rate environments, fell 0.39 percent and 0.30 percent respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.52 percent to end at 20,611.86. The S&P 500 gained 0.50 percent to 2,349.25 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.64 percent to 5,819.44. Fourth-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies have risen about 7.2 percent, the strongest expansion since the third quarter of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts on average expect S&P 500 earnings for the first quarter to rise 10.7 percent. Procter & Gamble jumped 3.71 percent to a two-year high, giving the biggest boost to the Dow and the S&P, after Trian Fund disclosed a stake, which could pressure the company to slice costs and slow-growing divisions. Shares of Southwest, United Continental, American Airlines and Delta rose between 2 percent and 4 percent after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported investments topping $2.1 billion in each of the carriers. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.44-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.79-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 80 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 156 new highs and 27 new lows. About 7.0 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the daily average of 6.8 billion over the last 20 sessions.

(AP Photo/Bikas Das) Share Written by Madhura Karnik 5 hours ago Quartz india India Inc is currently in the midst of an earnings season with firms announcing results of their financial performance for the October-December 2016 quarter. And while every season sees the management explaining profits and losses to shareholders and investors in different ways, this time around everyone has the same story: demonetisation was bad for business. Prime minister Narendra Modi’s Nov. 08, 2016, decision removed some 86% of currency in circulation (by value) in India. The ensuing cash crunch forced consumers in Asia’s third-largest economy to curb discretionary spending, making it tough for firms to manage liquidity, and thus slowed industrial growth. Here’s how executives from fast-moving consumer goods firms to power and infrastructure companies highlighted the impact of demonetisation over the last few months: “During the quarter, commercial vehicle segments of the company witnessed demand shrinkage due to the demonetisation—M&HCV (medium and heavy commercial vehicles) segment witnessed major pressure with a fall of 9% year-on-year and LCV (light commercial vehicles) segment was overall flat.” Tata Motors (pdf) “(The) government’s initiatives to curb the parallel economy and make a transition to (a) cashless economy have caused disruption whose impact on the business sentiment is yet to be conclusively assessed.” Larsen & Toubro “Demonetisation effectively drained liquidity. I don’t think that’s about price elasticity, I think that’s about the current shock to the circulation and liquidity.” James Quincey, Coca Cola CEO designate “If you look at Q2 second quarter results, the growth was higher than 10%, so you can safely assume that 1% to 2% growth we lost on account of demonetisation.” Nitin Sood, CFO, PVR (pdf) “The positive market growth momentum witnessed in the second quarter, aided by good monsoon and flow through of 7th Pay Commission benefits, was impacted with implementation of demonetisation in November 2016.” Varun Berry, managing director, Brittania “In India, demonetisation cost us a swing from strong growth through Q3 to a decline in Q4 .” Ian Cook, global CEO, Colgate-Palmolive “There has been a temporary adverse impact of the demonetisation leading to growth deceleration in India where we posted just 3% net sales growth.” Alexandre Ricard, chairman and CEO, Pernod Ricard “Demonetisation, however, did halt growth temporarily during the December quarter.” Sanjiv Mehta, managing director and CEO, Hindustan Unilever “(In) India, demonetisation, the elimination of Rs500 and Rs1,000 bank notes, that accounted for over 80% of that country’s currency in a cash-dominated economy, was an unexpected headwind.” Jon Moeller, CFO, Procter & Gamble “Demonetisation has affected the retail part of the business; and to some extent, in November-December, secondary and tertiary sales have also been slower mainly because of the same.” Gautam Seth, joint managing director, HPL Electric and Power “The estimated impact of demonetisation adversely impacted performance by a further 5% from our pharmaceutical product portfolio, which is predominantly within our adult care, as well as from our consumer brands.” A Vaidheesh, managing director, GlaxoSmithKline (pdf) “…Due to demonetisation impact the growth anticipated for the current year will not happen, but the long-term impact will definitely be good.” Prakash P Chhabria, executive chairman, Finolex (pdf) “…Demonetisation had a significant impact on our India business in Q4. And there’s still some lingering effects. I’m not sure we are totally out of the woods.” Indra K Nooyi, chairperson and CEO, PepsiCo Inc.

Melton and the Buckeyes competed against the Michigan Wolverines at the St. John Arena on Feb. 4. Credit: Aaron Tomich | For The Lantern Four Buckeyes will compete in the 2017 Winter Cup, including former gymnast and current director of operations Drew Moling, redshirt junior Sean Melton, sophomore Alec Yoder and future Buckeye and high-school senior Max Andryushchenko. The competition will take place on Thursday with finals on Saturday in the Westgate Las Vegas Resort and Casino. The scheduled times of the Winter Cup vary per athlete. Andryushchenko will compete at 4 p.m. ET while Melton, Yoder and Moling compete at 9:30 p.m. ET on Thursday. Finals will take place on Saturday at 10:15 p.m. ET. Performances at the Winter Cup will determine which 15 athletes, country-wide, will join the U.S. Men’s Senior National Team. Following the two-day competition, the top-four ranked all-around athletes will automatically qualify. The Men’s Program Committee selects up to 11 more gymnasts participating in the Winter Cup and members of the 2016 US Olympic team, including alternates, to keep their spot on the national team provided they earn qualifying national scores both days of the competition. After the 2016 Winter Cup, Melton was placed in U.S. Senior National Team following his third-place performance in all-around. Melton posted an overall score of 174.500, finishing behind three-time U.S. all-around champion Sam Mikulak (177.450) and 2015 NCAA all-around champion Akash Modi (175.300) from Stanford. Although he is still recovering from a wrist injury sustained during the 2016 preseason, Melton has not backed down and is ready to hit the floor again. “I’m going out there and showing all the USA committee that I’m back and I’m recovering. I’m not 100 percent back, but I’m getting there and I’ve improved on events that I’m doing,” Melton said. “I’m in good shape, and they could use me on Team USA to compete and help represent our country. I’m just excited to show what I’ve been working on since trial — and that I never gave up.” Yoder finished ninth overall in the 2016 Winter Cup, with a score of 170.700. He was placed in the all-around top-10 at the competition in the past two seasons — an eighth-place performance in 2015 placed him on the U.S. Senior National Team. “I’m looking forward to just getting out there again and competing,” Yoder said. “That’s why I do this sport. I do it because it’s fun and I do it because it’s what I love.” Moling, the current director of operations for the team, was 23rd overall with a combined all-around total of 162.750. Moling finished 16th on both rings (28.550) and high bar (27.850) at the 2016 Winter Cup. “After this meet, I’ll be done as this is the last one of my career,” Moling said. “I competed at this competition last year … and I did pretty well here; it qualified me to compete at the P&G Championship which is in the summer. Since I competed at the P&G, that pre-qualified me to compete at the Winter Cup this week. I figured I might as well come out and have one last competition.” According to the all-around placements and Men’s Program Committee’s points ranking system, the top 42 gymnasts will advance to the final competition along with the top-three gymnasts of each event. The all-around and individual event champions will be determined by their combined two-day score. OSU enters the week ranked No. 3 in the College Gymnastics Association (CGA) National Rankings, with the No. 3 average all-around score in the nation and a No. 1 ranking on pommel horse with an average score of 69.575.

Bigger-than-expected rises in retail sales and consumer prices in January reinforced confidence that the economy is growing at a solid pace following the strongest quarterly corporate earnings growth in over two years. In a meeting with top executives from US retail companies, Trump said he would lower taxes substantially and simplify the tax code, echoing a vow he made last week and on the campaign trail. Optimism that lower taxes and corporate deregulation will expand the economy pushed the three major indexes to all-time highs. The S&P 500 recorded its fifth straight record close and its longest non-stop winning streak since September 2013, even as some investors worried that Trump so far has provided no substantial details of his tax plan. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, in a testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, stood by the stance she took on Tuesday that the US central bank was on track to raise interest rates at an upcoming policy meeting. “A year ago, if Janet Yellen had come out with the statement she made, the market would have freaked out because the fundamentals were very soft,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network. “Now, if the Fed raises rates it's not going to shake the world because people are confident enough about the fundamentals.” The healthcare index was the top gainer, up 1.17 per cent. Financial stocks, which benefit from higher rates, rose 0.74 per cent. The utilities and real estate sectors, both of which do worse in high-rate environments, fell 0.39 percent and 0.30 percent respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.52 per cent to end at 20,611.86. The S&P 500 gained 0.50 per cent to 2,349.25 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.64 per cent to 5,819.44. Fourth-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies have risen about 7.2 per cent, the strongest expansion since the third quarter of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts on average expect S&P 500 earnings for the first quarter to rise 10.7 per cent. Procter & Gamble jumped 3.71 per cent to a two-year high, giving the biggest boost to the Dow and the S&P, after Trian Fund disclosed a stake, which could pressure the company to slice costs and slow-growing divisions. Shares of Southwest, United Continental, American Airlines and Delta rose between 2 per cent and 4 per cent after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported investments topping $2.1 billion in each of the carriers. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.44-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.79-to-1 ratio favoured advancers. The S&P 500 posted 80 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 156 new highs and 27 new lows. About 7.0 billion shares changed hands on US exchanges, above the daily average of 6.8 billion over the last 20 sessions.

The S&P 500 gained 0.50 percent to 2,349.25 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.64 percent to 5,819.44.Agencies | Updated: Feb 16, 2017, 08.37 AM IST NEW YORK: Wall Street pushed further into record-high territory on Wednesday, helped by a round of robust economic data and ongoing optimism that President Donald Trump will cut corporate taxes. For the fifth straight day, the three major US equity indices ended at all-time highs, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 0.5 percent to 20,611.86. The S&P 500 gained 0.50 percent to 2,349.25 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.64 percent to 5,819.44. Bigger-than-expected rises in retail sales and consumer prices in January reinforced confidence that the economy is growing at a solid pace following the strongest quarterly corporate earnings growth in over two years. In a meeting with top executives from US retail companies, Trump said he would lower taxes substantially and simplify the tax code, echoing a vow he made last week and on the campaign trail. Optimism that lower taxes and corporate deregulation will expand the economy pushed the three major indexes to all-time highs. The S&P 500 recorded its fifth straight record close and its longest non-stop winning streak since September 2013, even as some investors worried that Trump so far has provided no substantial details of his tax plan. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, stood by the stance she took on Tuesday that the US central bank was on track to raise interest rates at an upcoming policy meeting. "A year ago, if Janet Yellen had come out with the statement she made, the market would have freaked out because the fundamentals were very soft," said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network. "Now, if the Fed raises rates it's not going to shake the world because people are confident enough about the fundamentals." The healthcare index was the top gainer, up 1.17 percent. Financial stocks, which benefit from higher rates, rose 0.74 percent. The utilities and real estate sectors, both of which do worse in high-rate environments, fell 0.39 percent and 0.30 percent respectively. Fourth-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies have risen about 7.2 percent, the strongest expansion since the third quarter of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts on average expect S&P 500 earnings for the first quarter to rise 10.7 percent. Procter & Gamble jumped 3.71 percent to a two-year high, giving the biggest boost to the Dow and the S&P, after Trian Fund disclosed a stake, which could pressure the company to slice costs and slow-growing divisions. Shares of Southwest, United Continental, American Airlines and Delta rose between 2 percent and 4 percent after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported investments topping $2.1 billion in each of the carriers. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.44-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.79-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 80 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 156 new highs and 27 new lows. About 7.0 billion shares changed hands on US exchanges, above the daily average of 6.8 billion over the last 20 sessions.

US stocks have been on a tear since last week when President Donald Trump vowed to release details of his promised tax cut plan within two to three weeks. Yesterday, Trump reiterated that he would soon release specifics on the plan. Sentiment was further lifted by a hopeful outlook from US Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and solid US data on retail sales and consumer spending. All of these things lended confidence to the view that the Fed would soon raise interest rates, a positive for financial stocks. Besides New York, equity markets rose in London, Frankfurt, Paris and Tokyo, which gained 1.0 per cent. Market “bullishness stems from hawkish testimony by Janet Yellen... giving a fillip to a key financial sector whose profitability benefits from higher interest rates”, said Accendo Markets analyst Mike van Dulken. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich said, “It feels like investors might get the pro-growth part of the platform.” He added that mounting questions about Trump’s connections to Russia so far are not rattling investors. Among individual stocks Procter & Gamble jumped 3.7 per cent on news that activist investor Trian Fund Management led by Nelson Peltz holds 6.4 million shares worth US$575 million (RM2.5 billion) in the consumer products giant, according to a securities filing. Some news reports said Trian has added to the stake since the filing deadline and now holds more than US$3 billion in shares. Trian is known for pushing companies to reorganize businesses and return funds to shareholders. Shares in troubled conglomerate Toshiba plunged almost nine per cent — extending Tuesday’s eight per cent decline — after warning it faced a 390 billion yen (US$3.4 billion) loss in the fiscal year to March, hit by a 700 billion yen writedown at its US nuclear unit Westinghouse. The news prompted its chairman to resign while it also hinted at another accounting scandal following a profit-padding crisis in 2015.

Soros Fund Management, as the name suggests, manages the personal fortune of controversial billionaire George Soros. Their 13-F form detailing their purchases and sales in Q4 2016 was recently released. Goldman Sachs and other financial companies enjoyed large amounts of investment after Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election. Trump's promises of deregulation and tax cuts made the financial sector a safe bet for investors. Soros, who has spent hundreds of millions of his own money for liberal causes and is a vocal critic of President Trump, saw his stock portfolio briefly devalued by $1 billion after the election. © AP Photo/ Manuel Balce Ceneta Soros Teams Up With Attorneys Challenging Trump Immigration Order In addition to Goldman Sachs, Soros bought tens of millions of shares in companies such as Facebook, Time Warner, T Mobile, and Kohls. Soros also totally eliminated his stake in Barrick Gold as the gold market contracted in late 2016. Other companies that he sold major shares from include Intel, Wisdomtree, and Procter & Gamble. Soros's largest stock remains in Liberty Broadband, making up 14% of their portfolio. However, that was reduced by 6% since Q3 2016. Steven Mnuchin, former Executive Vice President of Goldman Sachs, was confirmed to the Senate as President Trump's Treasury Secretary on Tuesday. Mnuchin also was a member of an investment group alongside Soros in the mid-2000's. ...

And, chump change for Soros. Huge...gimme a brake. Reply Athanasios 08:35 16.02.2017 | 0 | Edit | Delete This is a useful article, although the amount of shares Soros bought is not the real news. The news is Mnuchin, whose connection to Goldman is not just an employer-emloyee relationship. The roots go deeper, and they are scary, but you have to look this up on your own. Regarding Trump, Mnuchin managed to get much of the election financing for Trump, on the condition that he would get the post of the Treasury if Trump became president. Without that financing (which was several times smaller than the financing Clinton received) Trump would not have been able to make it. But the real issue is what Trum will do for his country. Judging from his decisions so far, I am impressed.Show new comments (0) Сomment Reply in reply to(Show commentHide comment) | | Edit | Delete Save Thank you!

So bullish was Icahn that he said he made $1 billion worth of bets in the stock market the morning after Trump won the election. In a regulatory filing on Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Icahn, 80, revealed some of the other bets he made in the last three months of 2016. He loaded up on shares of his company, Icahn Enterprises, which invests in a variety of industries. Icahn also increased his position in Herbalife, the beleaguered vitamin supplements company in which he already owned more than 20 percent of the outstanding shares. Most Popular 1 Concrete wall threatening to fall from SF high-rise stabilized 2 United’s 4-hour flight to nowhere 3 2,000-pound concrete slab threatening to fall from SF building Icahn’s stock trading since the election has interested some Democratic senators, who recently raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest given his role as a special adviser to Trump on overhauling regulation. In a letter to the White House this week, seven Democratic senators sought assurances from the White House that Icahn would not recommend regulatory changes that could personally benefit some of his investments in a variety of industries. It is not just Icahn who is betting big on Trump. More broadly, Wall Street has turned bullish in the wake of Trump’s victory, pinning its hopes on a new administration — with a Republican-controlled Congress — delivering big tax cuts and rolling back regulation. The U.S. stock market has risen to a record high even as the White House has come under scrutiny for a ban on immigration from seven mostly Muslim countries — blocked while the matter is argued in court — and the resignation on Monday of Michael T. Flynn as national security adviser over concerns about conversations he had with Russian officials before Trump was sworn into office. In the months since the election, the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index has soared about 9 percent. Banks and other financial stocks have risen about 20 percent, while industrial stocks, including manufacturing and construction firms, have risen about 11 percent. Consumer company shares have gained roughly 9 percent. Icahn was one of hundreds of hedge fund and other investment fund managers to make their quarterly declarations to the SEC about which stocks they bought in recent months. Known as 13-Fs, these reports offer investors a glimpse at where these professional traders placed their bets during a given quarter, though they are filed roughly 45 days after the quarter ends. But the filings offer an imperfect window into the holdings of money managers because they are a snapshot of the past. They include only stocks traded in the United States but do not include short positions, or bets a manager might have made that a stock will fall in price. They also do not include bets on the future direction of the market, a favorite trade of Icahn and his firm. This time, however, the regulatory filings reveal the big rush of money into the market over a quarter that coincided with Trump’s election victory. Many of the hedge fund managers jumping on the so-called “Trump Bump” trade loaded up on financial stocks in the final quarter of the year, riding shares of banks like Goldman Sachs Group, which are up more than 37 percent since the election, and Bank of America, which has had a more than 40 percent gain over the same period. Some of the big-name managers whose firms added stakes in financial stocks in the final months of 2016 included Daniel Loeb, Julian Robertson, David Tepper and O. Andreas Halvorsen. Nelson Peltz’s firm, Trian Fund Management, took a big 4.86 percent stake in Procter & Gamble, one of the largest manufacturers of family, personal and household care products. Peltz has a reputation as an activist investor who takes stake in companies and then pushes for corporate changes to increase shareholder value. His firm also added shares of Bank of New York Mellon. Shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the giant mortgage finance firms that the federal government placed in conservatorship during the financial crisis, also have surged since Trump’s election. Shares of Fannie, for instance, are up more than 160 percent. The rally has been prompted in part by comments from Steven Mnuchin, Trump’s Treasury secretary and a former hedge fund manager. Mnuchin said he favored the recapitalization of the two firms and would plan to cut the government’s hold over them. Mnuchin, confirmed by the Senate on Monday, made those comments a day after Trump nominated him. But Icahn’s bet will be of most interest with politicians in Washington, where senators have sought assurances from the White House that safeguards would be put in place to ensure Icahn does not have access to information that is not public and could be used to make a profitable trade. Icahn Enterprises, Icahn’s firm, has several large investments in companies that are directly affected by regulations, which he has described as stifling. In the fourth quarter, he acquired another 2.9 million shares of his company. Alexandra Stevenson and Matthew Goldstein are New York Times writers.

The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 11.67 points, or 0.5%, to 2,349.25. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments It is the seventh straight gain for the index and its longest winning streak in three and a half years. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 107.45 points, or 0.5%, to 20,611.86. The Nasdaq composite rose 36.87, or 0.6%, to 5,819.44. Seven stocks rose on the New York Stock Exchange for every five that fell. It i s a striking reversal for the market from a year ago, when stocks around the world were tumbling on worries that another recession was on the way. Since then, the economy and job market have continued to improve, along with corporate profits. And the market got a jolt of adrenaline in November, when Donald Trump's surprise White House victory raised hopes for tax cuts and other business-friendly policies from Washington. The S&P 500 is up nearly 26% over the last 12 months, with more than half of the gain coming since Election Day. Such a performance would rank among the best calendar years the index has had in the last three decades. On Wednesday, reports showed that retailers had stronger sales in January than economists expected, and inflation at the consumer level was the highest in years. Consumer prices rose 2.5% in January from a year earlier, the highest rate since March 2012. The data give the Federal Reserve more encouragement to raise interest rates, and economists said the possibility is increasing that it may happen at the central bank's next meeting in March. Fed chair Janet Yellen indicated in evidence before a Congressional committee that the central bank will likely accelerate its pace of increases if the job market remains healthy and inflation keeps climbing. The Fed has raised rates just twice in the last two years, after holding rates at nearly zero from late 2008 to help lift the economy out of the Great Recession. "What really stuck out to me in Yellen's testimony was her adding emphasis to the idea that as things currently stand, even without fiscal stimulus, it would be prudent to hike sooner rather than later," said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management. "So if we do see tax cuts or infrastructure spending, they may need to quicken the pace of rate hikes. The bond market has clearly gotten the message." Treasury yields jumped as investors sold off bonds. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 2.50% from 2.47% late on Tuesday. The 30-year yield rose to 3.08% from 3.06%. When bonds pay more in interest, it can mean less demand from income investors for stocks that pay big dividends. Utility stocks in the S&P 500, which are some of the biggest dividend payers, fell 0.4%. Airline stocks cruised higher after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it added to its investments in several of them. Southwest Airlines rose 1.98 US dollars, or 3.6%, to 57.29 US dollars, United Continental rose 2.01 dollars, or 2.7%, to 75.75 dollars, Delta Air Lines rose 1.31 dollars, or 2.6%, to 51.17 dollars and American Airlines rose 97 cents, or 2.1%, to 47.54 dollars. Procter & Gamble rose 3.26 dollars, or 3.7%, to 91.12 dollars after activist investor Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management disclosed in a regulatory filing that it owns a stake in the company. American International Group sank to the biggest loss in the S&P 500 after reporting a larger operating loss for the fourth quarter than analysts expected. It fell 6.04 dollars, or 9%, to 60.85 dollars. Fossil Group plunged 3.39 dollars, or 14.8%, to 19.48 dollars. The watch and accessories company gave a profit forecast for 2017 that fell well short of analysts' predictions, and it said it may lose money. In Europe, the German Dax index rose 0.2%, while the French CAC 40 rose 0.6% and the UK's FTSE 100 added 0.5%. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 1%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 1.2% and the Kospi in South Korea gained 0.4%. The dollar ticked up to 114.26 Japanese yen from 114.22 yen late Tuesday. The euro rose to 1.0591 from 1.0572 dollars, and the British pound dipped to 1.2445 from 1.2465 dollars. Benchmark US crude fell nine cents to settle at 53.11 dollars a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 22 cents to 55.75 dollars a barrel in London. Natural gas rose two cents to 2.93 dollars per 1,000 cubic feet, heating oil fell a fraction of a penny to 1.63 dollars per gallon and wholesale gasoline was virtually flat at 1.55 dollars per gallon. Gold rose 7.70 dollars to 1,233.10 dollars per ounce, silver rose seven cents to 17.96 dollars per ounce and copper was virtually flat at 2.74 dollars per pound.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 16 February 2017 | MYT 6:13 AM Wall Street rises further into uncharted territory The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.52 percent to end at 20,611.86. The S&P 500 gained 0.50 percent to 2,349.25 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.64 percent to 5,819.44. Fourth-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies have risen about 7.2 percent, the strongest expansion since the third quarter of 2014 NEW YORK: Wall Street pushed further into record-high territory on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 notching a seven-session winning streak, helped by a round of robust economic data and ongoing optimism that President Donald Trump will cut corporate taxes. Bigger-than-expected rises in retail sales and consumer prices in January reinforced confidence that the economy is growing at a solid pace following the strongest quarterly corporate earnings growth in over two years. In a meeting with top executives from U.S. retail companies, Trump said he would lower taxes substantially and simplify the tax code, echoing a vow he made last week and on the campaign trail. Optimism that lower taxes and corporate deregulation will expand the economy pushed the three major indexes to all-time highs. The S&P 500 recorded its fifth straight record close and its longest non-stop winning streak since September 2013, even as some investors worried that Trump so far has provided no substantial details of his tax plan. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, stood by the stance she took on Tuesday that the U.S. central bank was on track to raise interest rates at an upcoming policy meeting. "A year ago, if Janet Yellen had come out with the statement she made, the market would have freaked out because the fundamentals were very soft," said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network. "Now, if the Fed raises rates it's not going to shake the world because people are confident enough about the fundamentals." The healthcare index <.SPXHC> was the top gainer, up 1.17 percent. Financial stocks <.SPSY>, which benefit from higher rates, rose 0.74 percent. The utilities <.SPLRCU> and real estate <.SPLRCR> sectors, both of which do worse in high-rate environments, fell 0.39 percent and 0.30 percent respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.52 percent to end at 20,611.86. The S&P 500 gained 0.50 percent to 2,349.25 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.64 percent to 5,819.44. Fourth-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies have risen about 7.2 percent, the strongest expansion since the third quarter of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts on average expect S&P 500 earnings for the first quarter to rise 10.7 percent. Procter & Gamble <PG.N> jumped 3.71 percent to a two-year high, giving the biggest boost to the Dow and the S&P, after Trian Fund disclosed a stake, which could pressure the company to slice costs and slow-growing divisions. Shares of Southwest <LUV.N>, United Continental <UAL.N>, American Airlines <AAL.O> and Delta <DAL.N> rose between 2 percent and 4 percent after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway <BRKa.N> reported investments topping $2.1 billion in each of the carriers.

The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 11.67 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,349.25. It's the seventh straight gain for the index and its longest winning streak in three and a half years. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 107.45 points, or 0.5 percent, to 20,611.86. The Nasdaq composite rose 36.87, or 0.6 percent, to 5,819.44. Seven stocks rose on the New York Stock Exchange for every five that fell. It's a striking reversal for the market from a year ago, when stocks around the world were tumbling on worries that another recession was on the way. Since then, the economy and job market have continued to improve, along with corporate profits. And the market got a jolt of adrenaline in November, when Donald Trump's surprise White House victory raised hopes for tax cuts and other business-friendly policies from Washington. The S&P 500 is up nearly 26 percent over the last 12 months, with more than half of the gain coming since Election Day. Such a performance would rank among the best calendar years the index has had in the last three decades. On Wednesday, reports showed that retailers had stronger sales in January than economists expected, and inflation at the consumer level was the highest in years. Consumer prices rose 2.5 percent in January from a year earlier, the highest rate since March 2012. The data give the Federal Reserve more encouragement to raise interest rates, and economists said the possibility is increasing that it may happen at the central bank's next meeting in March. Fed Chairman Janet Yellen indicated in testimony before a Congressional committee that the central bank will likely accelerate its pace of increases if the job market remains healthy and inflation keeps climbing. The Fed has raised rates just twice in the last two years, after holding rates at nearly zero from late 2008 to help lift the economy out of the Great Recession. "What really stuck out to me in Yellen's testimony was her adding emphasis to the idea that as things currently stand, even without fiscal stimulus, it would be prudent to hike sooner rather than later," said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management. "So if we do see tax cuts or infrastructure spending, they may need to quicken the pace of rate hikes. The bond market has clearly gotten the message." Treasury yields jumped as investors sold off bonds. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 2.50 percent from 2.47 percent late Tuesday. The 30-year yield rose to 3.08 percent from 3.06 percent. When bonds pay more in interest, it can mean less demand from income investors for stocks that pay big dividends. Utility stocks in the S&P 500, which are some of the biggest dividend payers, fell 0.4 percent. Airline stocks cruised higher after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it added to its investments in several of them. Southwest Airlines rose $1.98, or 3.6 percent, to $57.29, United Continental rose $2.01, or 2.7 percent, to $75.75, Delta Air Lines rose $1.31, or 2.6 percent, to $51.17 and American Airlines rose 97 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $47.54. Procter & Gamble rose $3.26, or 3.7 percent, to $91.12 after activist investor Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management disclosed in a regulatory filing that it owns a stake in the company. American International Group sank to the biggest loss in the S&P 500 after reporting a larger operating loss for the fourth quarter than analysts expected. It fell $6.04, or 9 percent, to $60.85. Fossil Group plunged $3.39, or 14.8 percent, to $19.48. The watch and accessories company gave a profit forecast for 2017 that fell well short of analysts' predictions, and it said it may lose money. In Europe, the German DAX index rose 0.2 percent, while the French CAC 40 rose 0.6 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 added 0.5 percent. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 1 percent, Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 1.2 percent and the Kospi in South Korea gained 0.4 percent. The dollar ticked up to 114.26 Japanese yen from 114.22 yen late Tuesday. The euro rose to $1.0591 from $1.0572, and the British pound dipped to $1.2445 from $1.2465. Benchmark U.S. crude fell 9 cents to settle at $53.11 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 22 cents to $55.75 a barrel in London. Natural gas rose 2 cents to $2.93 per 1,000 cubic feet, heating oil fell a fraction of a penny to $1.63 per gallon and wholesale gasoline was virtually flat at $1.55 per gallon. Gold rose $7.70 to $1,233.10 per ounce, silver rose 7 cents to $17.96 per ounce and copper was virtually flat at $2.74 per pound.

Reuters Published Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2017 4:18PM EST Last updated Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2017 5:27PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Canada’s benchmark stock index rose for the seventh straight day on Wednesday to a record high close, led by gains for its financial services group after strong economic data from both Canada and the United States. The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index ended up 58.92 points, or 0.37 per cent, at 15,844.95, a record close. “People are trying to run with the herd and I guess the big danger is that when you run with the herd you might get trampled at some point,” said Michael Sprung, president at Sprung Investment Management. The index has rallied more than 37 per cent since hitting a three-year trough in January last year. “One’s got to be very conscious of valuation and what they’re paying for securities,” Sprung said. Data showed Canada’s manufacturing sales jumped in December for the second month in a row, and that U.S. inflation and retail sales climbed in January, helping to push bond yields higher. Higher bond yields, which reduce the value of insurance companies’ liabilities and increase banks’ net interest margins, have helped underpin financials since the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8, with the sector up more than 14 per cent in that time. Royal Bank of Canada rose 1.1 per cent to C$98.53, while the overall financials group climbed 0.8 per cent. “We are just coming into a bank reporting season. We may see dividend increases but nevertheless I think people have been pretty complacent about the banks,” said Sprung. Energy shares gained 0.7 per cent as oil mostly held its ground after U.S. stockpiles soared to a record high. U.S. crude prices settled 9 cents lower at $53.11 a barrel. Nine of the index’s 10 main groups rose. The telecoms group climbed 1.8 per cent, led by a 5.1 per cent gain for Manitoba Telecom Services Inc to C$39.52 after Canada’s business competition watchdog asked BCE Inc to divest some assets to gain approval of its deal to buy the company. Industrials added 0.9 per cent, with CAE Inc climbing 6.6 per cent to C$20.24 after Desjardins raised its target price and rating on the stock. Teck Resources Ltd reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, but weaker demand at the start of the year spooked investors. Its shares plunged more than 10 per cent to C$29.32, while the materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, lost 1.2 per cent even as copper and gold prices rose. Wall Street rises further into uncharted territory Wall Street pushed further into record-high territory on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 notching a seven-session winning streak, helped by a round of robust economic data and ongoing optimism that President Donald Trump will cut corporate taxes. Bigger-than-expected rises in retail sales and consumer prices in January reinforced confidence that the economy is growing at a solid pace following the strongest quarterly corporate earnings growth in over two years. In a meeting with top executives from U.S. retail companies, Trump said he would lower taxes substantially and simplify the tax code, echoing a vow he made last week and on the campaign trail. Optimism that lower taxes and corporate deregulation will expand the economy pushed the three major indexes to all-time highs. The S&P 500 recorded its fifth straight record close and its longest non-stop winning streak since September 2013, even as some investors worried that Trump so far has provided no substantial details of his tax plan. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, stood by the stance she took on Tuesday that the U.S. central bank was on track to raise interest rates at an upcoming policy meeting. “A year ago, if Janet Yellen had come out with the statement she made, the market would have freaked out because the fundamentals were very soft,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network. “Now, if the Fed raises rates it’s not going to shake the world because people are confident enough about the fundamentals.” The healthcare index was the top gainer, up 1.17 per cent. Financial stocks, which benefit from higher rates, rose 0.74 per cent. The utilities and real estate sectors, both of which do worse in high-rate environments, fell 0.39 per cent and 0.30 per cent respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.52 per cent to end at 20,611.86. The S&P 500 gained 0.50 per cent to 2,349.25 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.64 per cent to 5,819.44. Fourth-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies have risen about 7.2 per cent, the strongest expansion since the third quarter of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts on average expect S&P 500 earnings for the first quarter to rise 10.7 per cent. Procter & Gamble jumped 3.71 per cent to a two-year high, giving the biggest boost to the Dow and the S&P, after Trian Fund disclosed a stake, which could pressure the company to slice costs and slow-growing divisions. Shares of Southwest, United Continental, American Airlines and Delta rose between 2 per cent and 4 per cent after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway reported investments topping $2.1-billion in each of the carriers. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.44-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.79-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 80 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 156 new highs and 27 new lows.

While you were sleeping: UPDATED US consumer boosts Wall Street rally Margreet Dietz Thursday February 16, 2017 Share Play NBR radio on Wall Street moved to fresh record highs after US reports showing a larger than expected increase in retail sales, while consumer prices rising at the fastest clip in nearly four years underpinned the outlook for growth in the economy and corporate profits. A Commerce Department report showed retail sales rose 0.4% in January, following an upwardly revised pace of 1.0% in December. Separately, a Labor Department report showed the consumer price index climbed 0.6% last month, following a 0.3% increase in December. "The US economy has quite a bit of momentum," Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto, told Reuters. "This morning's reports add a little more impetus for the Fed to move this quarter. Still not our call but it is becoming very interesting." Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen, in testimony to Congress on Tuesday and again on Wednesday, signalled the central bank will raise interest rates in the coming months. Traders are pricing in a 59% chance the Fed will raise rates by May and 78% by June, according to futures prices, Bloomberg reported. "Inflation is getting closer to the Fed's goal," Scott Brown, St. Petersburg, Florida-based chief economist for Raymond James Financial, told Bloomberg. "This is a green light for the Fed to raise rates in coming months." Dow adds another 107 points At the close of trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 107.45 points, or 0.5%, to a new high of 20,611.86. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.6% to 5819.44 and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index gained 0.5% to 2349.25 – both also a record levels. Advances in Procter & Gamble and Pfizer shares, up 3.2% and 1.6% respectively, led the gains in the Dow. JP Morgan gained 0.9% to lead financial stocks. Bucking the trend, PepsiCo shares fell after the company offered an outlook that fell short of expectations as chief executive Indra Nooyi warned of "continued macroeconomic challenges." The company says it expects core earnings of $US5.09 a share in 2017. While that's an increase from $US4.85 a share in 2016, it fell short of analysts' estimates for $US5.15. PepsiCo shares closed 0.3% weaker at $US106.73 after earlier rising as high as $US107.25 and dropped as low as $US104.77. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.509% from 2.470% on Tuesday.  Danone shares weaken In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the day with a 0.3% gain from the previous close. Germany's DAX Index added 0.2%, the UK's FTSE 100 Index rose 0.5%, and France's CAC 40 Index increased 0.6%. Shares of France's dairy giant Danone closed 0.2% weaker in Paris. It said it was aiming to cut costs by €1 billion ($1.5 billion) by 2020 as the world's top yoghurt maker predicted profit growth to ease this year as "economic conditions will remain particularly volatile and uncertain overall." "The challenges we faced [in 2016], including a slower turnaround of dairy in Europe and major market volatility, are a clear case to step up in our ability to seize consumer opportunities and improve our efficiency," CEO Emmanuel Faber said in the statement. Danone said it was targeting earnings per share growth of more than 5% for 2017. Last year its EPS increased 9.3%. The company said it would review its annual targets following the closing of its $US10 billion WhiteWave Foods acquisition, expected in the first quarter.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: Wall Street stocks jumped to record closes again on Wednesday (Feb 15) on fresh assurances that President Donald Trump intends to press ahead with tax cuts soon. For the fifth straight day, all three major US equity indices ended at all-time highs, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 107.45 points (0.52 per cent) to 20,611.86. The S&P 500 also rose 11.67 points (0.50 per cent) to 2,349.25, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 36.87 points (0.64 per cent) to 5,819.44. US stocks have been on a tear since last week when Trump vowed to release details of his promised tax cut plan within two to three weeks. On Wednesday, Trump told a White House meeting of retailers he would release specifics on the plan in the "not-too-distant future," and it will be "good and simpler." "It feels like investors might get the pro-growth part of the platform," Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich said, adding that questions about Trump's connections to Russia so far are not rattling investors. Analysts also said January data showing higher consumer inflation and retail sales helped to boost stocks. Sectors with strong gains included financials, with Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo all winning more than one per cent. Pharmaceuticals also outperformed: Pfizer gained 2.3 per cent, Gilead Sciences 3.3 per cent and Mylan 4.2 per cent. P&G jumped 3.7 per cent on news that activist investor Trian Fund Management led by Nelson Peltz holds 6.4 million shares worth US$575 million in the consumer products giant, according to a securities filing. Some news reports said Trian has added to the stake since the filing deadline and now holds more than US$3 billion in shares. Trian is known for pushing companies to reorganise businesses and return funds to shareholders. Insurer American International Group slumped 9.0 per cent after reporting a US$3 billion loss in the fourth quarter. - AFP/de Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more sentifi.com Channel News Asia - Sentifi topic widget My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Connect Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2017 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

In a meeting with top executives from U.S. retail companies, Trump said he would lower taxes substantially and simplify the tax code, echoing a vow he made last week. Optimism that lower taxes and corporate deregulation will expand the economy pushed the three major indexes to all-time highs. The S&P 500 was on track for its fifth straight record close, even as some investors worried that Trump so far has provided no substantial details of his tax plan. Also helping sentiment was robust economic data, including bigger-than-expected gains in retail sales and consumer prices in January, that reinforced the strength of the economy. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, stood by the stance she took on Tuesday that the U.S. central bank was on track to raise interest rates at an upcoming policy meeting. "A year ago, if Janet Yellen had come out with the statement she made, the market would have freaked out, because the fundamentals were very soft," said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network. "Now (Frankfurt: 11N.F - news) , if the Fed raises rates, it's not going to shake the world, because people are confident enough about the fundamentals." Financial stocks, which benefit from higher rates, rose 0.82 percent. The utilities and real estate sectors fell 0.7 percent and 0.23 percent respectively. At 2:41 p.m. (1941 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.47 percent at 20,600.88, while the S&P 500 had gained 0.39 percent to 2,346.81. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.48 percent to 5,810.14. Procter & Gamble (Swiss: PG-USD.SW - news) jumped 3.7 percent to a two-year high of $91.10, giving the biggest boost to the Dow and the S&P, after Trian Fund disclosed a stake, which could pressure the company to slice costs and slow-growing divisions. Shares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news) of Southwest, United Continental (NYSE: UAL - news) , American Airlines (Frankfurt: A1W97M - news) and Delta rose between 1 percent and 4 percent after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (Sao Paolo: BERK34.SA - news) reported investments topping $2.1 billion in each of the carriers. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.22-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.54-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

To support Ad Age and the industry we cover please either: SUBSCRIBE or WHITELIST US Lowdown: New Report: CMOs Have Half the Tenure of CEOs Published on February 15, 2017. Marketing leadership turnover continued to soar last year. The Lowdown is Ad Age's weekly look at news nuggets from across the world of marketing, including trends, campaign tidbits, executive comings and goings and more. If you are chief marketing officer and you've held the job for more than four years, you are above average. CMOs have the shortest average tenure in the C-suite at just 4.1 years, according to a new report by organizational advisory firm Korn Ferry. That is about half the average tenure of CEOs, which is eight years. The short lifespan of CMOs is not all bad news. While the position is plagued by high turnover, it's also true that CMOs are in a good spot to be plucked for promotions. "Today's customer-centric CMO role is exceptionally complex and requires the right balance of left as well as right brain skills, and very importantly, a differentiated set of leadership competencies," said Caren Fleit, senior client partner and leader of Korn Ferry's marketing center of expertise. "CMOs with this unique profile are in high demand and are often recruited to lead the next transformation. Also, in some cases, short tenure can be attributed to the organization not being well aligned behind the change that the CMO is tasked with leading." CMOs are also among the youngest executives in the C-suite, with an average age of 52. Only chief information officers are younger, and by just one year, with an average age of 51, according to the report. Marketing leadership turnover continued to soar last year. Recruiting firm Russell Reynolds tracked 177 marketing leadership appointments in the last two quarters of the year, up from 173 in the first half of the year. Total turnover for 2016 was the highest since Russell Reynolds began tracking it four years ago, according to a recent report. Of the CMOs who moved on in the first half of the year, 9% were internally promoted and more than 60% left their company for a new opportunity. One of the CMO's best friends are client-side agency relations directors. But two of the nation's largest marketers are making changes in that role... Coca-Cola Co. is searching for an executive to lead agency relations after the departure of Sarah Armstrong, who since 2006 was the marketer's director for worldwide agency operations. A company spokesman confirmed that she left the company on Feb. 3 and a successor has not yet been named. She left for personal reasons, according to the spokeswoman. Ms. Armstrong was an Ad Age Woman to Watch in 2009. She was known for implementing a "value-based" compensation model in which agencies are paid a guaranteed fee based on the value of each project, with the potential to earn a performance-based bonus. "We want our agencies to earn their profitability, but it's not guaranteed," she said at an industry conference in 2009. "We need them to be profitable and healthy, but they have to earn it through performance." Deb Giampoli Ms. Armstrong's exit follows the departure of another influential agency relations executive. Debra Giampoli, the director of global strategic agency relations for Mondelez International, left the food marketer in December, a spokeswoman recently confirmed. But Mondelez does not plan to replace her. Instead, the company reshuffled its agency relationship responsibilities across the global and regional marketing teams, with global and regional marketing capabilities people handling agency relationships, supporting the brand teams, according to the spokeswoman. On to the courtroom … When is craft beer not craft beer? Apparently when it's a Walmart private label, according to a lawsuit filed Feb. 10 in Hamilton County Common Pleas Court in Cincinnati. Plaintiff Matthew Adam takes issue with Walmart 's private-label craft beers, launched last year under the Trouble Brewing brand, including Cats Away IPA. The complaint cites a Brewers Association definition of craft brewers as "small, independent and traditional," brewing fewer than 6 million barrels annually, and owned no more than 25% by a bigger brewer. Walmart's craft beers are brewed by a unit of Genesee Brewing, Rochester, N.Y., maker of Genny Light, which produces well over that limit, according to the lawsuit. Mr. Adams contends the craft designation made him overpay for beer priced at $14 for a 12 pack at Walmart. His class-action suit seeks an injunction preventing Walmart from further merchandising the brews as craft, plus unspecified money damages for himself and others. "We hold our suppliers to high standards and are committed to providing our customers the quality products they expect," said a Walmart spokesman in an email statement. "While we have not yet been served with the complaint, we take this matter seriously and intend to defend ourselves against the allegations." From the Super Bowl files … Mr. Clean can dance in the Super Bowl, but apparently not with the Pine-Sol lady on Valentine's Day. Pine-Sol, a Clorox Co. brand, issued a Twitter challenge during the Super Bowl for a Valentine's Day dance-off pitting longtime pitchwoman Denise Amos against the animated mascot of Mr. Clean, a Procter & Gamble' brand. Mr. Clean didn't show up. "The interesting part about Super Bowl advertising, is that when brands announce their plans ahead of time, it gives the competition some time to strategize," said Sacha Connor, director of marketing for Pine-Sol. "So when we saw that Mr. Clean had a Super Bowl spot and it involved Mr. Clean dancing, we thought we could insert Pine-Sol into that conversation." Pine-Sol #PowerMoves tweet to Mr. Clean Credit: Pine-Sol via Twitter Pine-Sol got more than 226,000 respondents to a Twitter poll in which 86% said Mr. Clean should dance with Ms. Amos. Despite snubbing the invitation, Mr. Clean did OK in social media himself. The brand came in No. 2 (to Bud Light) among Super Bowl advertisers in overall social engagements (such as likes and comments), No. 5 in positive engagements, and No. 1 in terms of both comments and amplification (shares and retweets) through Super Bowl Sunday, according to Origami Logic. Surprisingly given what it deals with, kitty litter has become hotbed of innovation and marketing in recent years. Consider Clorox Co.'s Fresh Step Odor Shield ClumpLock products with Febreze, or Katherine Heigl as a kitty psychologist pitching Oil-Dri Corp.'s Cat's Pride in TV ads last year. Now Church & Dwight Co. aims to do everyone one better with Arm & Hammer Slide, which, according to new ads from Ferrara & Co., Princeton, N.J., just slides right out of the box for easy cleaning -- just like grease through a goose. More on Clorox: Heidi Dorosin, a marketing executive behind Clorox's "Bleachable Moments" advertising, has a new job dealing with bleachable moments of a completely different kind. As new chief marketing officer of Madison Reed, she's working with an up-and-coming direct marketer of at-home hair colorants free of many irritating and controversial chemicals often found in similar products, including ammonia, parabens, resorcinol and phthalates. While the business is mainly online, Madison Reed in December opened its first retail location, a Color Bar in Manhattan. At Clorox Co., where she spent 18 years, Ms. Dorosin, was most recently general manager and VP-marketing of the $1.5 billion namesake business. Catching up on some recent agency wins … Havas New York has had a busy start to the year, winning Mattress Firm's online-only Dream Bed brand and bringing on TBWA veteran Dan Goldstein as chief strategy officer. For Dream Bed, Havas is handling media, creative, data and technology, with the first work expected to be in market by early summer. The brand previously handled its marketing efforts in-house. Mr. Goldstein, who started at the shop earlier this month after spending the last four years working in the startup space, is reporting to Havas New York CEO Laura Maness. Salty snack maker Wise Foods has picked Kastner & Partners, North America, as its lead creative agency. Kastner & Partners said it aims to re-energize the 96-year old snack brand, known for products including Wise potato chips and Cheez Doodles, with work aimed at attracting new, younger consumers. The agency said it will handle creative, partnerships and sponsorships, branded experiences, events, video and content production. Lastly, food marketers should pay attention to this … The myriad phrases on food packaging including best before, best by, expires on, sell by and use by, have baffled consumers for years. Now, two major food industry lobbying groups are working to clear up the confusion by focusing on two phrases. The voluntary plan, announced Wednesday by the Food Marketing Institute and the Grocery Manufacturers Association, suggests using either "BEST If Used By" to describe product quality or the more serious "USE By" for any products for which there are food safety concerns or are highly perishable and therefore should be eaten by a certain date or disposed of. The FMI and GMA, which represent food retailers and food, beverage and consumer packaged goods makers, respectively, urged companies to update their phrasing as soon as possible, with a push for widespread adoption by the summer of 2018. The decision to focus on the two phrases may also help cut down on food waste, an issue the industry is trying to tackle. "Eliminating confusion for consumers by using common product date wording is a win-win because it means more products will be used instead of thrown away in error," said Jack Jeffers, VP-quality at Dean Foods, who led GMA's work on this issue. "It's much better that these products stay in the kitchen – and out of landfills." The plan was supported by a mix of companies, including the country's largest food seller. "Research shows that the multitude of date labels that appear on foods today are a source of confusion for many consumers," said Frank Yiannas, VP-food safety & health at Walmart.

In a meeting with top executives from U.S. retail companies, Trump said he would lower taxes substantially and simplify the tax code, echoing a vow he made last week. Optimism that lower taxes and corporate deregulation will expand the economy pushed the three major indexes to all-time highs. The S&P 500 was on track for its fifth straight record close, even as some investors worried that Trump so far has provided no substantial details of his tax plan. Also helping sentiment was robust economic data, including bigger-than-expected gains in retail sales and consumer prices in January, that reinforced the strength of the economy. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, stood by the stance she took on Tuesday that the U.S. central bank was on track to raise interest rates at an upcoming policy meeting. "A year ago, if Janet Yellen had come out with the statement she made, the market would have freaked out, because the fundamentals were very soft," said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network. "Now, if the Fed raises rates, it's not going to shake the world, because people are confident enough about the fundamentals." Financial stocks, which benefit from higher rates, rose 0.82 percent. The utilities and real estate sectors fell 0.7 percent and 0.23 percent respectively. At 2:41 p.m. (1941 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.47 percent at 20,600.88, while the S&P 500 had gained 0.39 percent to 2,346.81. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.48 percent to 5,810.14. Procter & Gamble jumped 3.7 percent to a two-year high of $91.10, giving the biggest boost to the Dow and the S&P, after Trian Fund disclosed a stake, which could pressure the company to slice costs and slow-growing divisions. Shares of Southwest, United Continental, American Airlines and Delta rose between 1 percent and 4 percent after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported investments topping $2.1 billion in each of the carriers. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.22-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.54-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 75 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 137 new highs and 23 new lows.

Photo / AP Wall Street moved to fresh record highs after US reports showing a larger-than-expected increase in retail sales while consumer prices rising at the fastest clip in nearly four years underpinned the outlook for growth in the economy and corporate profits. A Commerce Department report showed retail sales rose 0.4 per cent in January, following an upwardly revised pace of 1.0 per cent in December. Separately, a Labor Department report showed the consumer price index climbed 0.6 percent last month, following a 0.3 per cent increase in December. "The US economy has quite a bit of momentum as the year began," Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto, told Reuters. "This morning's reports add a little more impetus for the Fed to move this quarter. Still not our call but it is becoming very interesting." Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, in testimony to Congress on Tuesday and again on Wednesday, signalled the central bank will raise interest rates in the coming months. Traders are pricing in a 59 per cent chance the Fed will raises rates by May and 78 per cent by June, according to futures prices, Bloomberg reported. "Inflation is getting closer to the Fed's goal," Scott Brown, St. Petersburg, Florida-based chief economist for Raymond James Financial, told Bloomberg. "This is a green light for the Fed to raise rates in coming months." In 1.21pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.4 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.3 per cent. In 1.06pm trading, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index gained 0.3 per cent. The Dow climbed to a record 20,604.52, while the S&P 500 touched a high of 2,344.68, and the Nasdaq ascended to a record 5,804.48. Continued below.

Bucking the trend, shares of PepsiCo fell after the company offered an outlook that fell short of expectations as Chief Executive Officer Indra Nooyi warned of "continued macroeconomic challenges." The company said it expects core earnings of US$5.09 per share in 2017. While that's an increase from US$4.85 per share in 2016, it fell short of analysts' estimates for US$5.15. Shares of PepsiCo traded 0.3 per cent weaker at US$106.57 as of 12.27pm in New York. Earlier in the day the stock had risen as high as US$107.25 and dropped as low as US$104.77.

Danone said it is aiming to cut costs by 1 billion euros (US$1.1 billion) by 2020 as the world's top yoghurt maker predicted profit growth to ease this year as "economic conditions will remain particularly volatile and uncertain overall." "The challenges we faced [in 2016], including a slower turnaround of dairy in Europe and major market volatility, are a clear case to step up in our ability to seize consumer opportunities and improve our efficiency," CEO Emmanuel Faber said in the statement. Danone said it's targeting earnings per share growth of more than 5 per cent for 2017. Last year its EPS increased 9.3 per cent. The company said it will review its annual targets following the closing of its US$10 billion WhiteWave Foods acquisition, expected in the first quarter. - BusinessDesk Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Register Advertise Follow Subscribe to MAD London Programmatic Called Out On Brand Safety -- Agencies Or Vendors To Face The Chop? by Sean Hargrave, Staff Writer, February 13, 2017 So the whole programmatic disaster just became very real for Jaguar Land Rover. Its latest models were being flung around the Internet, eager to catch the eye of a potential buyer, right up until the weekend when the carmaker decided it was just too dangerous. No advertising is better than spots next to terror, and hate videos seems to be the logical conclusion to last week's events. The car brand told The Sunday Times yesterday that it is halting programmatic for the time being and is no doubt holding some detailed conversations in Mindshare's offices about a safer way forward right about now. To be honest, as unsavoury as it has been for brands like JLR, Mercedes-Benz and Waitrose, among others, to find out they have been inadvertently funding terror, it's a crisis long overdue. Nobody has wanted to lift the stone on programmatic just in case they ended up seeing cockroaches scuttling away from the light. Now an investigation at The Times has done this for the industry, the evidence is damning. In fact, that's probably the main point, it wasn't publishers, agencies or the tech companies they should be employing to keep an eye on this, it was a bunch of journalists who took it upon themselves to log on to some dodgy sites and see who was advertising on them. The industry didn't bring this to the advertisers' attention, journalists did. So who's going to clear up the mess? A lot of emphasis has to be placed on publishers in the first place. Someone like Google does indeed take hate videos off its YouTube servers, eventually, but how soon is quick enough. Ad exchanges should surely have a decent white list or blacklist of sites they use to stop brands from tarnishing their image. As for the ad agencies, I rather suspect that in the murky waters, as they have recently been labelled by P&G and others, there is no doubt a fee for the ad-tech guys who are supposed to verify that ads have appeared where they are viewable to a human being on a site that will not damage the budget-holder's brand image? I mentioned on Friday that JICWEBS has certified 34 brand safety companies that are there to ensure ads don't appear in embarrassing places, so there really is no excuse for media agencies to not be using protection. In fact, it's hard to imagine that the handful of household names outed by The Times did not have, between them, a single brand safety vendor hired by their media agency. So, whose head should roll? Media agencies not using JICWEBS approved brand safety tech or brand safety outfits who don't live up to their billing? Investigations will be conducted this week at London media agencies as understandably furious advertisers wonder how their name could be dragged into the mire. Either a media agency or two has to be fired, for not doing the right thing, or some of the 34 JICWEBS-approved vendors have to be fired for simply pretending to do the right thing.  If we see a review being called by any of the affected brands anytime soon, we'll all know which way the sword fell. ad technology, advertiser-agency relationship, brand image, london, uk Comment Next story loading About the Author Sean Hargrave is MediaPost's London Editor.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Wall Street pushed further into record-high territory on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 notching a seven-session winning streak, helped by a round of robust economic data and ongoing optimism that President Donald Trump will cut corporate taxes. Bigger-than-expected rises in retail sales and consumer prices in January reinforced confidence that the economy is growing at a solid pace following the strongest quarterly corporate earnings growth in over two years. In a meeting with top executives from U.S. retail companies, Trump said he would lower taxes substantially and simplify the tax code, echoing a vow he made last week and on the campaign trail. Optimism that lower taxes and corporate deregulation will expand the economy pushed the three major indexes to all-time highs. The S&P 500 recorded its fifth straight record close and its longest non-stop winning streak since September 2013, even as some investors worried that Trump so far has provided no substantial details of his tax plan. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, stood by the stance she took on Tuesday that the U.S. central bank was on track to raise interest rates at an upcoming policy meeting. "A year ago, if Janet Yellen had come out with the statement she made, the market would have freaked out because the fundamentals were very soft," said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network. "Now, if the Fed raises rates it's not going to shake the world because people are confident enough about the fundamentals." The healthcare index was the top gainer, up 1.17 percent. Financial stocks , which benefit from higher rates, rose 0.74 percent. The utilities and real estate sectors, both of which do worse in high-rate environments, fell 0.39 percent and 0.30 percent respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.52 percent to end at 20,611.86. The S&P 500 gained 0.50 percent to 2,349.25 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.64 percent to 5,819.44. Fourth-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies have risen about 7.2 percent, the strongest expansion since the third quarter of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts on average expect S&P 500 earnings for the first quarter to rise 10.7 percent. Procter & Gamble jumped 3.71 percent to a two-year high, giving the biggest boost to the Dow and the S&P, after Trian Fund disclosed a stake, which could pressure the company to slice costs and slow-growing divisions. Shares of Southwest , United Continental , American Airlines and Delta rose between 2 percent and 4 percent after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported investments topping US$2.1 billion in each of the carriers. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.44-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.79-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 80 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 156 new highs and 27 new lows. About 7.0 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the daily average of 6.8 billion over the last 20 sessions.

By YOUKYUNG LEE AP Business Writer SEOUL, South Korea (AP) - Asian stocks were mixed Thursday as investors took profit amid expectations that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates more aggressively than expected following upbeat U.S. economic data. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 0.5 percent to 19,349.97 while South Korea's Kospi edged down 0.1 percent to 2,081.32.

"Asian markets could once again see some profit-taking in today's session." US ECONOMY: On Wednesday, reports of stronger retail sales and inflation showed that the U.S. economy was stronger than expected. Consumer prices rose 2.5 percent in January from a year earlier, the highest rate since March 2012. Inflation at the consumer level was the highest in years. The data give the Federal Reserve more encouragement to raise interest rates, and economists said the possibility is increasing that it may happen at the central bank's next meeting in March. WALL STREET: The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 11.67 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,349.25. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 107.45 points, or 0.5 percent, to 20,611.86.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    A gauge of major world markets climbed to a record on Wednesday and U.S. Treasury yields rose as a strengthening economic outlook and recent commentary by Federal Reserve officials increased expectations of an interest rate hike in March. U.S. retail sales rose more than expected in January, while other data showed consumer prices recorded their biggest increase in nearly four years last month and a rise in manufacturing output. The reports follow comments from U.S. Fed Chair Janet Yellen on Tuesday, which she repeated to the House of Representatives on Wednesday, that the central bank would probably need to raise rates at one of the upcoming meetings. The economic data and Yellen's comments heightened expectations of a March interest rate hike, with U.S. short-term interest rates futures implying a 31-percent chance of a 25 basis point rise at its March meeting versus 18 percent in the prior session. "A year ago, if Janet Yellen had come out with the statement she made, the market would have freaked out, because the fundamentals were very soft," said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network. "Now, if the Fed raises rates, it's not going to shake the world, because people are confident enough about the fundamentals." In addition, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, a long-time dove who last year switched tack and began pushing for tighter monetary policy said the central bank may need to raise interest rates a bit more aggressively than the thrice-per-year pace forecast by policymakers. Goldman Sachs raised its expectations that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates in the first half of 2017 and J.P. Morgan brought forward its forecast of the next rate increase to May. The prospect of higher rates pushed U.S. financial stocks 0.7 percent higher on Wall Street for their fifth straight day and lifted the benchmark S&P 500 index to another record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 107.45 points, or 0.52 percent, to 20,611.86, the S&P 500 gained 11.67 points, or 0.50 percent, to 2,349.25 and the Nasdaq Composite added 36.87 points, or 0.64 percent, to 5,819.44. The S&P 500 scored its seventh straight advance, its longest winning streak in nearly four years. MSCI's benchmark global equity index rose 0.7 percent to 444.22 points, after touching a record high of 444.29. Europe's index of leading 300 stocks closed up 0.4 percent to 1,465.05, its highest since December 2015, buoyed by bank earnings. Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields rose to a two-and-a-half week high of 2.524 percent after the data and were last down 9/32 in price to yield 2.5004 percent. The U.S. dollar reversed course after touching a one-month high in the wake of the U.S. data as investors booked profits and was last down 0.19 percent against a basket of major currencies. The decline snapped a 10-session streak of gains for the greenback. Oil prices eased after a choppy session as record high U.S. crude and gasoline inventories fed concerns about a glut. U.S. crude settled down 0.2 percent at $53.11 and Brent closed down 0.4 percent to $55.75 a barrel. © 2017 Thomson/Reuters. All rights reserved.

Trump, in a meeting with top executives at U.S. retail companies, said he would lower taxes substantially and simplify the tax code - echoing a vow he made last Thursday that renewed optimism about the economy and revived the "Trump trade". The rally has caused the market's record-setting run to enter its fifth day, despite Trump again providing little details on his plans. Also boosting sentiment was robust economic data - including bigger-than-expected gains in retail sales and consumer prices in January - that reinforced the strength of the economy. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, in a testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, stood by the stance she took on Tuesday that the central bank was on track to raise interest rates at an upcoming policy meeting. "She (Yellen) has made it clear that she wants to raise rates," said Neil Massa, senior equity trader at Manulife Asset Management in Boston. "Before she spoke yesterday, the March meeting wasn't in play, but now that is definitely on the table and I think the numbers today bode well for her to do that." After the economic data, traders raised the odds of a rate hike in March to 26.6 percent from 13.3 percent before the data was released, according to Thomson Reuters data. Financial stocks, which benefit in a higher rate environment, again led the gainers among the 11 major S&P sectors, with a 0.63 percent gain. The rate-sensitive utilities and real estate sectors fell the most. At 12:31 p.m. ET (1731 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 72.81 points, or 0.36 percent, at 20,577.22. The S&P 500 was up 4.3 points, or 0.18 percent, at percent, at 2,341.88. The Nasdaq Composite was up 14.71 points, or 0.25 percent, at 5,797.28. Procter & Gamble jumped 3.7 percent to a two-year high of $91.10, giving the biggest boost to the Dow and the S&P, after Trian Fund disclosed a stake, which could pressure the company to slice costs and slow-growing divisions. Shares of Southwest, United Continental, American Airlines and Delta rose between 2 percent and 3.7 percent after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported investments topping $2.1 billion in each of the carriers. AIG weighed the most on the S&P, dropping 8.6 percent after the commercial insurer reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,505 to 1,341. On the Nasdaq, 1,404 issues rose and 1,353 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 63 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 119 new highs and 18 new lows.

Posted 15 Feb 2017 20:45 Updated 16 Feb 2017 05:25 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., February 7, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Wall Street pushed further into record-high territory on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 notching a seven-session winning streak, helped by a round of robust economic data and ongoing optimism that President Donald Trump will cut corporate taxes. Bigger-than-expected rises in retail sales and consumer prices in January reinforced confidence that the economy is growing at a solid pace following the strongest quarterly corporate earnings growth in over two years. In a meeting with top executives from U.S. retail companies, Trump said he would lower taxes substantially and simplify the tax code, echoing a vow he made last week and on the campaign trail. Optimism that lower taxes and corporate deregulation will expand the economy pushed the three major indexes to all-time highs. The S&P 500 recorded its fifth straight record close and its longest non-stop winning streak since September 2013, even as some investors worried that Trump so far has provided no substantial details of his tax plan. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, stood by the stance she took on Tuesday that the U.S. central bank was on track to raise interest rates at an upcoming policy meeting. "A year ago, if Janet Yellen had come out with the statement she made, the market would have freaked out because the fundamentals were very soft," said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network. "Now, if the Fed raises rates it's not going to shake the world because people are confident enough about the fundamentals." The healthcare index was the top gainer, up 1.17 percent. Financial stocks , which benefit from higher rates, rose 0.74 percent. The utilities and real estate sectors, both of which do worse in high-rate environments, fell 0.39 percent and 0.30 percent respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.52 percent to end at 20,611.86. The S&P 500 gained 0.50 percent to 2,349.25 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.64 percent to 5,819.44. Fourth-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies have risen about 7.2 percent, the strongest expansion since the third quarter of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts on average expect S&P 500 earnings for the first quarter to rise 10.7 percent. Procter & Gamble jumped 3.71 percent to a two-year high, giving the biggest boost to the Dow and the S&P, after Trian Fund disclosed a stake, which could pressure the company to slice costs and slow-growing divisions. Shares of Southwest , United Continental , American Airlines and Delta rose between 2 percent and 4 percent after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported investments topping US$2.1 billion in each of the carriers. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.44-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.79-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 80 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 156 new highs and 27 new lows. About 7.0 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the daily average of 6.8 billion over the last 20 sessions.

Nwibe Home / Business / Cover / Nigeria, U.S. plans to enhance trade, investment relationship Nigeria, U.S. plans to enhance trade, investment relationship — 15th February 2017 Mr Okechukwu Enelamah, the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, on Wednesday, February 15, discussed with U.S. business executives in Washington on how the two countries could enhance their trade and investment relation. Mrs Constance Ikokwu, the Strategic Communications Adviser to the minister, made this known in a statement in Abuja. Ikokwu said the discussion followed the telephone call between President Muhammadu Buhari and U.S. President, Donald Trump, on Monday, where both presidents discussed security and economic issues. She quoted Enelamah as saying “the U.S. has historically been one of Nigeria’s top trading partners; it was the biggest importer of Nigeria’s crude oil at some point. “In the last five years, however, the sharp decline in U.S. imports of our crude, on account of rising domestic production of shale, altered the trade balance between our two countries. “This development presents Nigeria with good opportunity for diversification and to explore and increase non-oil export, especially in agricultural products, services and digital economy.” The adviser stated that the minister also participated in a Facebook live conversation with U.S.-Africa Business Centre. She added that some of the companies that attended the gathering included Google, Microsoft, Blackstone, Procter and Gamble, UPS, Johnson and Johnson, Boston Scientific, Philip Morris International, Lekoil Oil, ITIC, among others. Ikokwu said after the discussion, Enelamah attended events on Ease of Doing Business and Investment at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and the Hudson Institute. She noted that the minister met with Linda Thomas Greenfield, outgoing Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs at the U.S. State Department, as well as U.S. Trade Representatives for Africa at Commerce Office. “Issues on the agenda at the State Department ranged from Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), SMEs and Nigeria’s leadership on the continent. “The agenda also focused on continued engagement with the new administration, while the commerce office focused on trade and the World Trade Ogansation,’’ Ikokwu said. She said Mr Scott Eisner, the President of the U.S.-Africa Business Centre and Vice President for African Affairs at the Chamber, said Nigeria was an important partner for U.S. businesses. Ikokwu quoted Eisner as saying “our conversation highlighted the work being done to strengthen economic relations between our two countries and how we can continue to build on this relationship.” According to her, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is the world’s largest business federation, representing the interests of more than three million businesses.

The conversation focused on enhancing trade and investment relationship between both countries. This comes in the context of a telephone call between President Muhammadu Buhari and President Donald Trump Monday, February 13, where both presidents discussed security and economic issues. It is seen as suggesting the US consideration of Nigeria as a strategic partner. “The US has historically been one of Nigeria’s top trading partners; it was the biggest importer of Nigeria’s crude oil at some point. In the last five years, however, the sharp decline in U.S. imports of our crude, on account of rising domestic production of shale, has altered the trade balance between our two countries. This development presents Nigeria with a good opportunity for diversification and to explore and increase non-oil export – especially in agricultural products, services and the digital economy,” Enelamah said. On his part, Scott Eisner, president of the US-Africa Business Center and Vice President for African Affairs at the Chamber stated that “With the largest economy in Africa, Nigeria is an important partner for U.S. businesses. Our conversation highlighted the work being done to strengthen the economic relationship between our two countries and how we can continue to build on this relationship.” Enelamah also participated in a Facebook Live conversation with the US-Africa Business Center following the roundtable. Some of the companies that attended the gathering included Google, Microsoft, Blackstone, Procter and Gamble, UPS, Johnson and Johnson, Boston Scientific, Philip Morris International, Lekoil Oil, ITIC, etc. The US Chamber of Commerce is the world’s largest business federation representing the interests of more than three million businesses of all sizes, sectors, and regions, as well as state and local chambers and industry associations. Its International Affairs division includes more than 70 regional and policy experts and 25 country-and region-specific business councils and initiatives. The US Chamber also works closely with 117 American Chambers of Commerce abroad. The US-Africa Business Center is the preeminent voice in the global business community advocating for increased trade between the US and Africa. After the roundtable, the minister went on to attend events focusing on the Ease of Doing Business and Investment at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, CSIS, and the Hudson Institute. He answered questions from a mixed audience of business executives, government officials, diplomats and others. He similarly had meetings at the State Department with Linda Thomas Greenfield,  outgoing assistant secretary of state for African Affairs and US Trade Representatives for Africa at the Commerce office. Issues on the agenda at the state department ranged from the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, AGOA, SMEs, Nigeria’s leadership on the Continent and continued engagement with the new administration, while the commerce office focused on trade and the WTO.

Bigger-than-expected rises in retail sales and consumer prices in January reinforced confidence that the economy is growing at a solid pace following the strongest quarterly corporate earnings growth in over two years. In a meeting with top executives from U.S. retail companies, Trump said he would lower taxes substantially and simplify the tax code, echoing a vow he made last week and on the campaign trail. Optimism that lower taxes and corporate deregulation will expand the economy pushed the three major indexes to all-time highs. The S&P 500 recorded its fifth straight record close and its longest non-stop winning streak since September 2013, even as some investors worried that Trump so far has provided no substantial details of his tax plan. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, stood by the stance she took on Tuesday that the U.S. central bank was on track to raise interest rates at an upcoming policy meeting. "A year ago, if Janet Yellen had come out with the statement she made, the market would have freaked out because the fundamentals were very soft," said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network. "Now, if the Fed raises rates it's not going to shake the world because people are confident enough about the fundamentals." The healthcare index .SPXHC was the top gainer, up 1.17 percent. Financial stocks .SPSY, which benefit from higher rates, rose 0.74 percent. The utilities .SPLRCU and real estate .SPLRCR sectors, both of which do worse in high-rate environments, fell 0.39 percent and 0.30 percent respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 0.52 percent to end at 20,611.86. The S&P 500 .SPX gained 0.50 percent to 2,349.25 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 0.64 percent to 5,819.44. Fourth-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies have risen about 7.2 percent, the strongest expansion since the third quarter of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts on average expect S&P 500 earnings for the first quarter to rise 10.7 percent. Procter & Gamble (PG.N) jumped 3.71 percent to a two-year high, giving the biggest boost to the Dow and the S&P, after Trian Fund disclosed a stake, which could pressure the company to slice costs and slow-growing divisions. Shares of Southwest (LUV.N), United Continental (UAL.N), American Airlines (AAL.O) and Delta (DAL.N) rose between 2 percent and 4 percent after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) reported investments topping $2.1 billion in each of the carriers. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.44-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.79-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 80 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 156 new highs and 27 new lows. About 7.0 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the daily average of 6.8 billion over the last 20 sessions.

(Mark Lennihan/AP) At midday: TSX continues record run, led by financials Add to ... Reuters Published Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2017 11:38AM EST Last updated Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2017 11:40AM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Canada’s main stock index rose for the seventh straight day on Wednesday to set a fresh record high, led by gains for its financial services group after strong economic data from both Canada and the United States. Data showed Canada’s manufacturing sales jumped for the second month in a row in December and that U.S. inflation and retail sales climbed in January, helping to push bond yields higher. Higher bond yields, which reduce the value of insurance companies’ liabilities and increase banks’ net interest margins, have helped underpin financials since the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8, with the sector up more than 14 per cent in that time. Toronto-Dominion Bank rose 0.9 per cent to $69.18, while the overall financials group climbed 0.7 per cent. At 11:10 a.m. ET, the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index rose 39.5 points, or 0.25 per cent, to 15,825.53, a new record high. Energy shares gained 0.4 per cent as oil turned higher after the release of U.S. crude inventory data. Eight of the index’s 10 main groups rose. The telecoms group climbed 1.5 per cent, led by a 4.7-per-cent gain for Manitoba Telecom Services Inc to $39.35 after Canada’s business competition watchdog asked BCE Inc to divest some assets to gain approval of its deal to buy the information and communications technology provider. Industrials added 0.5 per cent, with CAE Inc climbing 3.9 per cent after Desjardins raised its target price and rating on the stock. Teck Resources Ltd, North America’s largest producer of steel-making coal, reported better-than-expected quarterly results, helped by higher realized prices. Still, its shares fell 3.9 per cent to $31.39, while the materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, lost 1 percent even as copper prices rose. Copper prices advanced 0.6 per cent to $6,055 a tonne and gold futures were unchanged at $1,224.4 an ounce. Shopify Inc. forecast better-than-expected 2017 revenue due to higher demand for its ecommerce software, which is used to set up and manage online stores. Its shares jumped 5.7 per cent to $77.44. Wall Street’s record-setting run entered its fifth day on Wednesday, as President Donald Trump repeated his promise of tax cuts and on upbeat economic data that increased the odds of a rate hike and lifted bank stocks. Mr. Trump, in a meeting with top executives at U.S. retail companies, said he would lower taxes substantially and simplify the tax code - echoing a vow he made last Thursday that renewed optimism about the economy and revived the “Trump trade.” His comments boosted already upbeat sentiment after a spate of robust economic data - including bigger-than-expected gains in retail sales and consumer prices in January - that reinforced the strength of the economy. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, in a testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, stood by the stance she took on Tuesday that the central bank was on track to raise interest rates at an upcoming policy meeting. “She (Yellen) has made it clear that she wants to raise rates,” said Neil Massa, senior equity trader at Manulife Asset Management in Boston. “Before she spoke yesterday, the March meeting wasn’t in play, but now that is definitely on the table and I think the numbers today bode well for her to do that.” After the economic data, traders raised the odds of a rate hike in March to 26.6 per cent from 13.3 perc ent before the data was released, according to Thomson Reuters data. Financial stocks, which benefit in a higher rate environment, again led the gainers among the 11 major S&P sectors, with a 0.63-per-cent gain. The rate-sensitive utilities and real estate sectors fell the most. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 79.89 points, or 0.39 per cent, at 20,584.3. The S&P 500 was up 5.07 points, or 0.21 per cent, at percent, at 2,342.65 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 11.65 points, or 0.2 per cent, at 5,794.23. Procter & Gamble jumped 3.3 percent to $90.79 and gave the biggest boost to the Dow and the S&P after activist investor Trian Fund disclosed a stake in the consumer products company. Shares of Southwest, United Continental, American Airlines and Delta rose between 2 per cent and 4.2 per cent after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway reported investments topping $2.1-billion in each of the carriers. AIG weighed the most on the S&P, dropping 8.8 per cent to $60.95 after the commercial insurer reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss. Oil turned positive Wednesday, brushing off a bearish increase in U.S. crude inventories to record highs and returning focus to OPEC’s record compliance with its supply-cut accord. U.S. crude stocks rose 9.5 million barrels last week, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said, nearly three times more than forecasts, but confirming a trade group’s report of a larger-than-expected build late Tuesday. U.S. crude inventories hit a peak at 518.12 million barrels while gasoline stocks also touched a record, rising 2.8 million barrels to 259.1 million barrels, according to the EIA. “The U.S. witnessed yet another week of higher-than-expected stock builds; nonetheless, the build was less than last week’s, which helped prices recouping some of the earlier losses,” said Abhishek Kumar, Senior Energy Analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London. “A build in gasoline stock is in tandem with season norms and further builds are expected in the coming weeks as demand for the fuel remains low.” Brent crude futures rose 27 cents to $56.24 a barrel. U.S. crude futures rose 24 cents to $53.44 a barrel, a 0.5 percent gain. To support prices, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers, including Russia, are cutting output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day in the first half of 2017. Although OPEC has made a strong start in complying with the cuts, rising U.S. stocks and a revival of U.S. oil output have limited the price rise. Oil was also pressured by a strong U.S. dollar after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen signaled a faster pace of interest rate rises. Gains in the dollar make oil more expensive for holders of other currencies. OPEC in January delivered record compliance of over 90 percent with its output curbs, according to estimates from the International Energy Agency and figures collected by OPEC’s headquarters. Within OPEC, adherence is mixed. Top exporter Saudi Arabia, keen to make the deal work, said it cut output by more than the amount called for by the agreement. BMI Research, in a report, said a compliance rate of just 40 percent by Iraq, OPEC’s second-biggest producer, “could prove problematic to group cohesion.” Russia and the other non-OPEC producers have so far delivered smaller cutbacks. The oil minister of Oman, one of the participating non-OPEC countries, said he expected compliance to improve.

After the economic data, traders raised the odds of a rate hike in March to 26.6 percent from 13.3 percent before the data was released, according to Thomson Reuters data. Financial stocks, which benefit in a higher rate environment, again led the gainers among the 11 major S&P sectors, with a 0.63 percent gain. The rate-sensitive utilities and real estate sectors fell the most. At 11:07 a.m. ET (1808 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 79.89 points, or 0.39 percent, at 20,584.3. The S&P 500 was up 5.07 points, or 0.21 percent, at percent, at 2,342.65 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 11.65 points, or 0.2 percent, at 5,794.23. Procter & Gamble jumped 3.3 percent to $90.79 and gave the biggest boost to the Dow and the S&P after activist investor Trian Fund disclosed a stake in the consumer products company. Shares of Southwest, United Continental, American Airlines and Delta rose between 2 percent and 4.2 percent after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported investments topping $2.1 billion in each of the carriers. AIG weighed the most on the S&P, dropping 8.8 percent to $60.95 after the commercial insurer reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss.

The S&P 500 index showed 60 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 101 new highs and 16 new lows.

Pune, India - February 15, 2017 /MarketersMedia/ -- The growth of this market is mainly attributed to the growing number of small/private dental clinics, rising incidences of dental caries, increasing disposable incomes in emerging countries, growing awareness about dental hygiene, and economic gain for dental practitioners. However, growing trend of group/large dental practices and reluctance by dental practitioners to adopt dental dispensing practices may hinder the growth of this market to certain extent. Complete report on global professional dental care market spread across 178 pages, profiling 10 companies and supported with 172 tables and 26 figures is now available at http://www.rnrmarketresearch.com/professional-dental-care-market-by-type-toothbrush-electric-battery-powered-toothpaste-mouthwash-denture-products-dental-accessories-whitening-products-breath-freshener-dental-floss-dental-water-jet-st-to-2021-market-report.html . The professional dental care market is segmented on the basis of type-of-product, and region. On the basis of type-of-products, the market is segmented into toothpastes, toothbrushes, mouthwashes/rinses, denture products, dental accessories/ancillaries, and other professional dental care products. The toothpastes accounted for the largest share of the global professional dental care market in 2015. The largest share of this market is mainly attributed to its wide utilization by the end-users. The toothbrushes segment is expected to register fastest growth during the forecast period of 2016-2021.

Geographically, the global professional dental care market is segmented into North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Rest of the World. In 2015, Europe commanded a major share of the professional dental care market. This is mainly due to the region's aging population, governmental expenditure on oral healthcare across Europe, availability of huge amount of private dental practitioners, and growing awareness about dental hygiene. However, Asia-Pacific is expected to witness the highest growth rate during the forecast period. Growth in the Asia-Pacific market can be attributed to the increasing number of geriatric population, growing number of dental diseases, growing dental expenditure, and increasing dental tourism across the APAC countries.

Posted 15 Feb 2017 20:45 Updated 16 Feb 2017 05:25 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., February 7, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Wall Street pushed further into record-high territory on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 notching a seven-session winning streak, helped by a round of robust economic data and ongoing optimism that President Donald Trump will cut corporate taxes. Bigger-than-expected rises in retail sales and consumer prices in January reinforced confidence that the economy is growing at a solid pace following the strongest quarterly corporate earnings growth in over two years. In a meeting with top executives from U.S. retail companies, Trump said he would lower taxes substantially and simplify the tax code, echoing a vow he made last week and on the campaign trail. Optimism that lower taxes and corporate deregulation will expand the economy pushed the three major indexes to all-time highs. The S&P 500 recorded its fifth straight record close and its longest non-stop winning streak since September 2013, even as some investors worried that Trump so far has provided no substantial details of his tax plan. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, stood by the stance she took on Tuesday that the U.S. central bank was on track to raise interest rates at an upcoming policy meeting. "A year ago, if Janet Yellen had come out with the statement she made, the market would have freaked out because the fundamentals were very soft," said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network. "Now, if the Fed raises rates it's not going to shake the world because people are confident enough about the fundamentals." The healthcare index was the top gainer, up 1.17 percent. Financial stocks , which benefit from higher rates, rose 0.74 percent. The utilities and real estate sectors, both of which do worse in high-rate environments, fell 0.39 percent and 0.30 percent respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.52 percent to end at 20,611.86. The S&P 500 gained 0.50 percent to 2,349.25 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.64 percent to 5,819.44. Fourth-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies have risen about 7.2 percent, the strongest expansion since the third quarter of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts on average expect S&P 500 earnings for the first quarter to rise 10.7 percent. Procter & Gamble jumped 3.71 percent to a two-year high, giving the biggest boost to the Dow and the S&P, after Trian Fund disclosed a stake, which could pressure the company to slice costs and slow-growing divisions.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 10:40 PM, February 15, 2017 Updated: 5:50 AM, February 16, 2017 Wall Street pushed further into record-high territory on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 notching a seven-session winning streak, helped by a round of robust economic data and ongoing optimism that President Donald Trump will cut corporate taxes. Bigger-than-expected rises in retail sales and consumer prices in January reinforced confidence that the economy is growing at a solid pace following the strongest quarterly corporate earnings growth in over two years. In a meeting with top executives from U.S. retail companies, Trump said he would lower taxes substantially and simplify the tax code, echoing a vow he made last week and on the campaign trail. Optimism that lower taxes and corporate deregulation will expand the economy pushed the three major indexes to all-time highs. The S&P 500 recorded its fifth straight record close and its longest non-stop winning streak since September 2013, even as some investors worried that Trump so far has provided no substantial details of his tax plan. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, stood by the stance she took on Tuesday that the U.S. central bank was on track to raise interest rates at an upcoming policy meeting. "A year ago, if Janet Yellen had come out with the statement she made, the market would have freaked out because the fundamentals were very soft," said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network. "Now, if the Fed raises rates it's not going to shake the world because people are confident enough about the fundamentals." The healthcare index <.SPXHC> was the top gainer, up 1.17 percent. Financial stocks <.SPSY>, which benefit from higher rates, rose 0.74 percent. The utilities <.SPLRCU> and real estate <.SPLRCR> sectors, both of which do worse in high-rate environments, fell 0.39 percent and 0.30 percent respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> rose 0.52 percent to end at 20,611.86. The S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 0.50 percent to 2,349.25 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 0.64 percent to 5,819.44. Fourth-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies have risen about 7.2 percent, the strongest expansion since the third quarter of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts on average expect S&P 500 earnings for the first quarter to rise 10.7 percent. Procter & Gamble <PG.N> jumped 3.71 percent to a two-year high, giving the biggest boost to the Dow and the S&P, after Trian Fund disclosed a stake, which could pressure the company to slice costs and slow-growing divisions. Shares of Southwest <LUV.N>, United Continental <UAL.N>, American Airlines <AAL.O> and Delta <DAL.N> rose between 2 percent and 4 percent after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway <BRKa.N> reported investments topping $2.1 billion in each of the carriers. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.44-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.79-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 80 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 156 new highs and 27 new lows. About 7.0 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the daily average of 6.8 billion over the last 20 sessions.

Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said on Tuesday, before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, that delaying a rate hike would be unwise, but did not indicate when the Fed would raise rates. While she painted a largely upbeat picture of the economy, she also expressed uncertainty over economic policy under the Trump administration. Yellen's testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday will be scrutinized for further clues on when the central bank might pull the trigger, as will be comments by three Fed presidents at other scheduled appearances. Some Fed officials have said it would be prudent to move sooner than later, but traders have priced in a slim chance of a rate hike at the Fed's March meeting. "Yellen's hawkish stand yesterday was well received as investors focused on the upbeat assessment of the economy," Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial wrote in a note. Adding to the recent spate of strong data, reports on Wednesday showed retail sales rose much more than expected last month, while the consumer price index notched its biggest rise in nearly four years as households paid more for gasoline and other goods. Dow e-minis were up 2 points, or 0.01 percent at 8:57 a.m. ET, with 30,047 contracts changing hands. S&P 500 e-minis were down 5 points, or 0.21 percent, with 136,215 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 9.25 points, or 0.18 percent, on volume of 24,669 contracts. Wall Street's main indexes have closed at record highs for the past four sessions, sparked by President Donald Trump's promise on Thursday of a major tax announcement and fueled by Yellen's comments. "While the rise continues to feed on itself, a prudent approach of not fighting the tape should be accompanied by being cautious," Cardillo said. Among stocks, Dow component Procter & Gamble rose 2.5 percent to $90.05 after activist investor Trian Fund disclosed a $3.5 billion stake in the consumer products company. AIG slipped nearly 5 percent to $63.55 after the commercial insurer reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss. Shares of Southwest, United Continental, American Airlines rose more than 2 percent after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported investments topping $2.1 billion in each of the carriers. Watchmaker Fossil dropped 19 percent to $18.51 after posting fourth-quarter revenue that missed analysts' expectations.

Yellen's testimony before the House Financial Services Committee starts at 10:00 a.m. ET and comes a day after she said delaying a rate hike would be unwise, without indicating when the Fed would pull the trigger. Her testimony will be scrutinized for further clues on when the central bank might move, as will be comments by three Fed presidents at other scheduled appearances. Some Fed officials have said it would be prudent to move sooner than later. Also boosting the odds of a rate hike were strong reports that showed retail sales rose much more than expected last month, while the consumer price index notched its biggest rise in nearly four years as households paid more for gasoline and other goods. After the data, traders raised the odds of a hike in March to 26.6 percent from the 13.3 percent odds priced in before the data was released. Financial stocks, which benefit in a higher rate environment, again led the gainers among the 11 major S&P sectors with a 0.2 percent gain. Yellen on Tuesday, before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, painted a largely upbeat picture of the economy, but also expressed uncertainty over economic policy under the Trump administration. At 9:40 a.m. ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 20.25 points, or 0.1 percent, at 20,524.66 and the S&P 500 was down 1.31 points, or 0.05 percent, at percent, at 2,336.27.

Six of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, led by interest rate-sensitive utilities and real estate sectors. Apple rose to a record high of $136.26 after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway increased its stake in the company. Shares of Southwest, United Continental, American Airlines and Delta rose about 2 percent after Berkshire reported investments topping $2.1 billion in each of the carriers. Procter & Gamble rose 2.7 percent to $90.28 and gave the biggest boost to the Dow and the S&P after activist investor Trian Fund disclosed a stake in the consumer products company. AIG weighed the most on the S&P, slipping 7.7 percent to $13.78 after the commercial insurer reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,762 to 889. On the Nasdaq, 1,383 issues fell and 929 advanced.

The conversation focused on enhancing trade and investment relationship between both countries. This comes in the context of a telephone call between President Muhammadu Buhari and President Donald Trump Monday, where both Presidents discussed security and economic issues. It is seen as suggesting the U.S. consideration of Nigeria as a strategic partner. “The U.S. has historically been one of Nigeria’s top trading partners; it was the biggest importer of Nigeria’s crude oil at some point. In the last five years, however, the sharp decline in U.S. imports of our crude, on account of rising domestic production of shale, has altered the trade balance between our two countries. This development presents Nigeria with a good opportunity for diversification and to explore and increase non-oil export – especially in agricultural products, services and the digital economy,” said Minister Enelamah. On his part, the President of the U.S.-Africa Business Center and Vice President for African Affairs at the Chamber Scott Eisner, stated that “With the largest economy in Africa, Nigeria is an important partner for U.S. businesses. Our conversation highlighted the work being done to strengthen the economic relationship between our two countries and how we can continue to build on this relationship.” Enelamah also participated in a Facebook Live conversation with the U.S.-Africa Business Center following the roundtable. Some of the companies that attended the gathering include Google, Microsoft, Blackstone, Procter and Gamble, UPS, Johnson and Johnson, Boston Scientific, Philip Morris International, Lekoil Oil, ITIC, etc. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is the world’s largest business federation representing the interests of more than 3 million businesses of all sizes, sectors, and regions, as well as state and local chambers and industry associations. Its International Affairs division includes more than 70 regional and policy experts and 25 country-and region-specific business councils and initiatives. The U.S. Chamber also works closely with 117 American Chambers of Commerce abroad. The U.S.-Africa Business Center is the preeminent voice in the global business community advocating for increased trade between the United States and Africa. After the roundtable, the Minister went on to attend events focusing on the Ease of Doing Business and Investment at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and the Hudson Institute. He answered questions from a mixed audience of business executives, government officials, diplomats and others. He similarly had meetings at the State Department with the outgoing Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Linda Thomas Greenfield and U.S. Trade Representatives for Africa at the Commerce office. Issues on the agenda at the state department ranged from the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), SMEs, Nigeria’s leadership on the Continent and continued engagement with the new administration, while the commerce office focused on trade and the WTO. Minister Enelamah was accompanied by his Trade Adviser and Chief Negotiator Ambassador Chiedu Osakwe, Special Adviser Bunmi Adeoye and Strategic Communications Adviser, Constance C. Ikokwu.

Revenue also beat forecasts, and the company announced a 7 percent dividend hike, as well. PepsiCo gave a full-year outlook that fell slightly below Street forecasts, with CEO Indra Nooyi saying the company expects global economic challenges this year. Anthem — Anthem filed suit against Cigna, seeking a temporary restraining order against Cigna's move to end their $48 billion deal. Cigna had sued Anthem late yesterday, saying regulatory hurdles mean that Anthem's planned purchase of Cigna cannot possibly be completed, and seeking a multibillion-dollar reverse breakup fee. Hilton Worldwide — The hotel operator beat estimates by 5 cents a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of 70 cents per share. Revenue also beat forecasts. Hilton was helped by increased bookings at higher prices. Amazon, Alphabet — The Wall Street Journal reports that the companies have separate plans to use their Amazon Echo and Google Home smart speakers as home telephones, although implementation of those features does face some hurdles such as telecom regulations. Integra LifeSciences — The medical technology company announced an offer to buy Johnson & Johnson's Codman Neurosurgery unit for $1.045 billion in cash. Kraft Heinz, ConAgra Brands — The two were rated "buy" in new coverage at Deutsche Bank and called "top picks" by the firm. Deutsche Bank said it was recommending names that have a higher probability of value creation in the current environment. Merck — The drugmaker halted a late-stage trial of an experimental Alzheimer's treatment. Merck determined that the treatment was ineffective. Apple — Berkshire Hathaway nearly quadrupled its stake in Apple by buying 42 million more shares and benefiting from the rise to an all-time high yesterday. Berkshire also added to its stakes in airline companies American Airlines Group, Delta Air Lines, United Continental, and Southwest, and took a new stake in Monsanto, all according to its latest quarterly Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing. Express Scripts — Express Scripts beat estimates by a penny a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.88 per share. The pharmacy benefit manager's revenue came in below Street forecasts and it also gave a lower-than-expected outlook for the current quarter. AIG — AIG took a $5.6 billion charge against earnings to boost reserves for claims, dragging the insurance company's quarterly loss well below estimates at $2.72 per share. However, AIG also announced a $3.5 billion stock buyback program, following strong results in areas such as consumer insurance. Fossil — Fossil earned $1.03 per share for the fourth quarter, 15 cents a share shy of estimates. The watch maker's revenue also missed forecasts. Fossil also gave worse-than-expected guidance for the current quarter, with ongoing impact from currency fluctuations, as well as a decline in overall sales of traditional watches. Humana — Humana announced a $1.5 billion stock buyback and raised its quarterly dividend to 40 cents per share from the prior 29 cents a share. The news follows the end of its deal to merge with Aetna, which was announced on Tuesday morning. Procter & Gamble — Activist investor Trian Fund Management has taken a stake in P&G now worth $3.5 billion, according to Trian's quarterly SEC filing. The consumer products giant represents Trian's largest-ever holding, as measured by dollar value. Fortress Investment Group — The asset manager will be bought by Japan's Softbank for $3.3 billion, or $8.08 per share, compared to a closing price of $6.21 on Tuesday. Twitter — CEO Jack Dorsey added nearly 426,000 new shares to his holdings, according to a new SEC filing. The purchase was worth just over $7 million. Apollo Global Management — The private-equity firm hired investment banks to explore either a sale or initial public offering of the Chuck E. Cheese restaurant chain, according to Reuters. CSX — The railroad operator is asking shareholders to vote on compensation benefits for prospective CEO Hunter Harrison, and on demands by activist investor Paul Hilal that his fund, Mantle Ridge, be reimbursed for "exceptionally unusual" compensation benefits for Harrison. The vote has not yet been scheduled, but was called for after talks between CSX and Hilal fell apart.

It happens like this: Nordstrom declares it's dropping presidential daughter Ivanka Trump's product line. The president tweets against Nordstrom in high dudgeon. "Many women nationwide" (according to Breitbart News', ahem, unscientific estimate) cut up their Nordstrom cards in protest of the luxury retailer's decision. And Charles in Charge actor Scott Baio declares that he will "NEVER AGAIN!" shop at Nordstrom. L'affair Nordstrom is illustrative of a broader trend: From the TV shows we watch to where we choose to buy groceries, from fast-food chains to arts-and-crafts supply stores, there is seemingly no area of American life that is uninfected by political polarization. And that's a good thing. America is a land of ever-more-customized content, goods, and services. The late Russian leader Boris Yeltsin recognized this on a trip to a grocery store near Houston in 1989. "Their supermarkets have 30,000 food items," he said. "You can't imagine it. It makes people feel more secure." Americans have so much to choose from! And it's inevitable that when faced with such variety, Americans are bound to make consumer choices that comport with their values. Indeed, Harvard Business School's Michael Norton told The Atlantic that politically motivated boycotts often depend on the existence of such choices: "There's some research that shows that one of the key predictors of boycotts is actually the availability of substitutes. … It's as though you will strongly express your political opinions as long as there is a comparable brand that you can buy instead." Boycotting isn't a zero-sum game of consumer hardball; it's a harmless expression of identity. We talk a big game of outrage, but we're not exactly depriving ourselves of anything when we engage in political boycotting. In fact, the term "boycott," evoking as it does the refusal to buy something, should probably be retired. Because of the choices available to us, Americans today often make affirmative choices with our wallets and eyeballs. Consider the emergence of Chic-fil-A as a distinctly Christian fast-food alternative in the Obama era. But no one is giving up much of anything by boycotting Chic-fil-A. We're all familiar with those highway signs pointing to the assortment of lodging and restaurant options no more than a mile-and-a-half up the road. If you're opposed to same-sex marriage and enjoy the soothing sounds of instrumental praise-and-worship music, Chic-fil-A is your best bet. If not, then there's McDonald's, Wendy's, Burger King, Arby's, KFC, and on and on and on.. There is emotional satisfaction to be derived in eating at Chic-fil-A — as well as in driving past Chic-fil-A and saying, "I refuse to support them with my business." But let's not be fooled: If you're in the latter group, you're really not giving up anything. So what do we even mean when we say we'd like to return to the halcyon days before everything became so damn politicized? Effectively, we mean the 1950s, when homogeneity reigned. As the economists Brad DeLong and Stephen S. Cohen write of Eisenhower-era America: For breakfast, they all had — along with the same milk, break, and butter — a large variety of cereal in boxes, all coming from the same three or four companies. They all washed their hands and faces with Lux or Palmolive or Ivory, and brushed their teeth with toothpaste from the same three companies (Procter & Gamble, Unilever, and Colgate-Palmolive). Their refrigerators and washers and dryers were differentiated in only the small details. By and large, everyone also saw the same movies and heard the same music. … Overwhelmingly, they sent their kids to the public school, a powerful drive for neighborhood separation and homogenization. And of course, the rich man's Cadillac had many features to signal that it was better and certainly more expensive than the plainer man's Chevrolet, but they shared about 85 percent of the same parts. [Concrete Economy] We cannot return to that era. And the truth is, few of us want to. Now, I recognize that emotions are running hot. The lines of polarization are hardening. One half of the country can't stand the other half. It's to the point where we're taking out ads for roommates in which support for Trump is considered a dealbreaker. Quite literally, we can't live with each other. But that's the adaptive genius of modern-day America. It's the consumer equivalent of the federalist experiment, where provincial and territorial variety is considered a feature rather than a bug: We don't have to shop together. We don't have to eat together. We don't have to live together. Pluralism is hard. We have in the Trump administration a cadre of men who seem bent on making it harder. But I would submit that our ability to withdraw from one another is, paradoxically, one of the essential ways in which we're going to make it through all this in one multifarious piece.

The New York-based firm disclosed a $14.9 million position in Goldman Sachs and made a new bet on Bank of America worth $3.9 million. One of its biggest buys during the last three months of 2016 was a call option on the S&P Select Sector SPDR Fund — Financial Sector worth $72.6 million. A number of asset managers bought into financial stocks during the final months of 2016 after Trump's surprise victory suggested that tax cuts and a reduction of regulatory burdens plus higher interest rates could benefit the financial sector. Soros recently hired UBS executive Dawn Fitzpatrick to be the firm's chief investment officer, putting a woman in charge of his portfolio for the first time. Soros sold his entire stake in Procter & Gamble, while Trian Fund Management bought a stake worth $3.5 billion in the company.

It's had a brilliant run -- but could this be just the beginning for Nvidia? Sean O'Reilly (TMFBuckeye) Feb 14, 2017 at 8:47PM The term "blue chip stock" carries a connotation of stability, safety, and often a laudable history of profit growth and steadily increasing dividends. If you were to ask someone for examples of a blue chip stock, you'd get names such as General Electric, Coca-Cola, and Johnson & Johnson. However, these companies weren't always the gargantuan pillars of stability they are today. Even the most sainted of stock market names started out as small enterprises. Enter NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), one of the best-performing stocks of the past 12 months and a burgeoning leader in not only high-performance graphics chips but also artificial intelligence. The stock is up more than 300% in the past 12 months and shows no signs of stopping. However, for NVIDIA's true long-term potential to be realized, it will have to become part of an elite group of companies in the upper echelons of corporate America, alongside the likes of Google and Microsoft. Does NVIDIA have what it takes to become a future blue chip stock? Image source: Getty Images. Recent events The past 13 or so months have been extremely good to NVIDIA shareholders. Since Jan. 1, 2016, shares are up some 268%, much of that gain coming in the last quarter of 2016 (fiscal third quarter of 2017), following a fantastic earnings release in October. Total sales exploded 54% to over $2 billion, fueled by gaming graphics cards, data-center applications, and potential developments in the automotive division. Earnings per share rocketed up some 90% year over year, to $0.83 per share. Fourth-quarter results, released on Feb. 9, were even better. Revenue surged 55% year over year to $2.17 billion, gross margin came in at a healthy 60%, and earnings of $0.99 per share crushed Wall Street estimates of $0.85.   So investors have not only an extremely profitable and growing enterprise on their hands, but also one that has a great deal of future potential. That's a fantastic combination, should the company's management continue to implement on both its vision and the company's offerings. And under the leadership of CEO Jen-Hsun Huang, the company has a history of doing just that. A history of excellence NVIDIA was founded in 1993 and went public in January 1999. The company quickly became a success as gaming in the home became more and more commonplace. Now, advanced graphics chips, of which NVIDIA is the No. 1 designer and manufacturer, are now found in most personal computers in the marketplace. NVIDIA's customers now include the biggest names around: Microsoft, HP, Dell, Sony, Apple, and scores of other computer system integrators. But technology -- particularly hardware designing and manufacturing -- is a tough business to consistently make money in. Price deflation, fierce competition, and the constant need to stay ahead of the next innovation don't lend themselves to consistent profits for shareholders. In this regard, NVIDIA is a laudable outlier. Not only has it continued to grow both revenue and profit year in and year out for the past two decades, but it's also done so while consistently generating above-average returns on invested capital -- a rare thing in corporate America, let alone the technology industry. A valuation built on great expectations NVIDIA's attractiveness as a stock begins to diminish somewhat when one casts an eye toward its current valuation.  NVIDIA PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts In addition to a valuation that's priced to perfection, there are questions about NVIDIA's long-term competitive advantages. Does NVIDIA make the best products in the marketplace today? Absolutely. Does it have a unique offering in the burgeoning market of driverless-car computing? You bet. However, for the company to truly become a blue chip stock, its business needs to become self-sustaining. Its products need to be so commonplace and necessary that it would be inconceivable for the company to not exist. Microsoft has 90% market share of operating systems, Alphabet's Google search engine has a virtual search monopoly in the United States, Procter & Gamble's Tide laundry detergent is found in more laundry rooms in the world than can be counted, and there are scarcely any countries on Earth that don't have Coca-Cola readily available. NVIDIA certainly has the best graphic chips available, and the demands of virtual-reality gaming alone may mean it has years of growth ahead of it, but consumers simply want their games to work flawlessly, no matter how that gets done. There's nothing to stop a new chip manufacturer to enter the market and steal away NVIDIA's bread and butter. It's simply the nature of the technology industry. Technology itself is forever changing -- and that means businesses need to constantly evolve or else face extinction. It seems that, at best, NVIDIA might become a future Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) -- a chipmaker with a brand name that commands respect and generates fantastic profit -- but one that has to always be on the lookout for competing products as it seeks to roll out new and better offerings year after year.  True blue?  NVIDIA is certainly a fantastic company and may very well continue to be a fantastic stock to own for years to come. Its management is top notch, and its participation in the burgeoning markets of driverless cars and advanced gaming are intriguing. However, for the company to truly become a blue chip stock, it will need to build a business that's more recurring in nature, and not reliant on continued releases of newer and better products. That doesn't mean NVIDIA isn't a stock to own; it just means that the odds of one day seeing it as a blue chip stock are low.  Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors.

Bigger-than-expected rises in retail sales and consumer prices in January reinforced confidence that the economy is growing at a solid pace following the strongest quarterly corporate earnings growth in over two years. US economy leaps higher, setting stage for Fed raising rates In a meeting with top executives from US retail companies, Trump said he would lower taxes substantially and simplify the tax code, echoing a vow he made last week and on the campaign trail. Optimism that lower taxes and corporate deregulation will expand the economy pushed the three major indexes to all-time highs. The S&P 500 recorded its fifth straight record close and its longest non-stop winning streak since September 2013, even as some investors worried that Trump so far has provided no substantial details of his tax plan. Great listening session with CEO's of the Retail Industry Leaders Association this morning! pic.twitter.com/sy6xJcWfcF — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017 Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, stood by the stance she took on Tuesday that the US central bank was on track to raise interest rates at an upcoming policy meeting. “A year ago, if Janet Yellen had come out with the statement she made, the market would have freaked out because the fundamentals were very soft,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network. “Now, if the Fed raises rates it’s not going to shake the world because people are confident enough about the fundamentals.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.52 per cent to end at 20,611.86. The S&P 500 gained 0.50 per cent to 2,349.25 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.64 per cent to 5,819.44. Fourth-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies have risen about 7.2 per cent, the strongest expansion since the third quarter of 2014. Analysts on average expect S&P 500 earnings for the first quarter to rise 10.7 per cent. The health care index was the top gainer, up 1.17 per cent. Financial stocks, which benefit from higher rates, rose 0.74 per cent. The utilities and real estate sectors, both of which do worse in high-rate environments, fell 0.39 per cent and 0.30 per cent respectively. Procter & Gamble jumped 3.71 per cent to a two-year high, giving the biggest boost to the Dow and the S&P, after Trian Fund disclosed a stake, which could pressure the company to slice costs and slow-growing divisions. Shares of Southwest, United Continental, American Airlines and Delta rose between 2 and 4 per cent after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway reported investments topping US$2.1 billion in each of the carriers.   Most Popular Viewed 1 Hong Kong land parcels worth over HK$30bn set for tender 2 Is missing tycoon Xiao Jianhua losing control of his business empire? 3 China’s obsession with skyscrapers reaches new heights 4 Why would Malaysia sell its ‘symbol of dignity’ to China? 5 HTC scales back production amid cash flow problems Shared 1 HTC scales back production amid cash flow problems 2 China’s obsession with skyscrapers reaches new heights 3 Why would Malaysia sell its ‘symbol of dignity’ to China? 4 Is missing tycoon Xiao Jianhua losing control of his business empire? 5 Key stocks tied to missing billionaire hit by 4.3bn yuan sell-off Commented 1 Abe’s dangerous path of cosying up to the US 2 Lies, half-truths and mistrust dominate Trump White House 3 ‘Long Hair’ has opened up a can of worms 4 With travel ban, America has shot itself in the foot 5 Era of exploiting ‘regulatory gaps’ coming to an end       You may also like Politics Why Malaysia is fighting Singapore over a rock 11 Feb 2017 - 12:21pm 5 Intelligent cars to make world safer In partnership with: HKT PREMIER Hong Kong Dwindling support for bitcoin businesses in Hong Kong 11 Feb 2017 - 10:55pm 2 We can make a difference Sponsored by: Hong Kong International School Opinion Trump’s assault on Muslims takes US back to 1882 11 Feb 2017 - 11:31am 36 World CIA files reveal how US used psychics to spy on Iran 11 Feb 2017 - 9:27pm 3 Post Magazine Hong Kong men victims of sextortion by Philippine cybercriminals 11 Feb 2017 - 9:31am 14 Geopolitics Revealed: Malaysia’s ‘new evidence’ in island row against Singapore 11 Feb 2017 - 2:19am 16 Hong Kong John Tsang builds big poll lead over Carrie Lam in leadership race 10 Feb 2017 - 10:28am 35 China China to store foreigners’ fingerprints upon entry, starting with Shenzhen 10 Feb 2017 - 8:25am 27 China Fire at Chinese factory that supplied Samsung Note 7 batteries 9 Feb 2017 - 10:25am 8 China Does China’s Communist Party follow any succession rules at all? 7 Feb 2017 - 9:21pm 10 South China Morning Post Stay connected Facebook Twitter Hong Kong Politics Economy Health & Environment Law & Crime Education & Community News China Hong Kong Asia World China Policies & Politics Diplomacy & Defence Money & Wealth Society Economy Tech Business Companies Markets Property Investor Relations Mutual Funds Economy China Economy Money & Wealth Country Reports Tech China Tech Enterprises Social & Gadgets Start-ups Apps & Gaming Innovation Leaders & Founders Science & Research E-Commerce Lifestyle Arts & Entertainment Health & Beauty Film & TV Food & Drink Families Music Fashion & Luxury Books Travel & Leisure Watches Sport Hong Kong China Golf Racing Rugby Soccer Tennis Boxing Comment Insight & Opinion Harry's View Blogs Polls Letters Multimedia Video Photos Infographics SCMP Chronicles Magazine Post Magazine Style Good Eating Destination Macau HK Magazine Archive Other Weather Most Popular 7 Days Index Country Reports Crossword Promotions Directories Luxehomes At your service Business Services Directory MICE Biz Restaurant Directory Information Buy SCMP Photos Copyright Licensing RSS Feeds SCMP.com search Historical Archive Print Subscription Advertising Opportunities Contact our Advertising Sales HK Rate card Overseas Rate Card China Rate Card The Marketer SCMP Marketing Solutions SCMP Outdoor Advertising Recruitment Advertising Events SCMP Events Operation Santa Claus Other Sites CPJobs.com Education Post Young Post Cosmopolitan CosmoGIRL!

Soren Larson reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript The Dow and the Nasdaq eked out record intraday highs Wednesday. Stocks getting a lift from strong economic news. In January, firm demand for electronics goods pushed retail sales up more than expected. And consumer prices posted their biggest increase in nearly four years. Oxford Economics' chief U.S. economist Gregory Daco: SOUNDBITE: GREGORY DACO, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, OXFORD ECONOMICS, (ENGLISH) SAYING: "I think there is a general sentiment that the latest numbers in terms of retail sales and inflation do make a case for an earlier rate hike, March being a possibility. I think taht being said, we're stil llikely to see a cautious Fed when it comes to tightening monetary policy. And we still believe that the next rate hike will be in June." A source says Verizon is close to a deal to cut its price to acquire Yahoo's internet business by up to $350 million. The deal was worth $4.8 billion when it was first announced. Airline stocks flew higher. Southwest, United Continental, American, and Delta getting a lift after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported investing more than $2 billion in each of the carriers. Apple also got the Buffett bump after Berkshire boosted its stake in the iPhone maker. Procter & Gamble shot up. Activist investor Trian Fund has taken a $3.5 billion stake in the consumer products giant. Anthem filed a suit to block Cigna from walking away from their $34 billion merger deal. Cigna told Anthem Tuesday it had ended the deal. In Europe, financial stocks led by Credit Agricole drove shares higher.

X US Fed rate rise assurance boosts European bank shares Gambling firms in Ireland and UK under pressure after HSBC cuts ratings about 14 hours ago Barry O'Halloran US Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen: Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB both performed well on news that she intended to stick with her plan to increase interest rates. Photograph: Yuri Gripas/Reuters         Good earnings reports and the prospect of a US interest rate rise boosted bank shares in Europe and aided markets generally. DUBLIN Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB both performed well as the sector rose across Europe on news that Janet Yellen, chairwoman of the US Federal Reserve, intended sticking with her plan to increase interest rates. Higher interest rates translate into bigger profits for banks, which have been lending money at low charges for a long period. Bank of Ireland rose 2.04 per cent to 25 cent while Permanent TSB closed 0.74 cent up at €2.72, having broken the €2.75-mark during the day. Both traded strongly, dealers said. The Republic’s biggest landlord, Irish Residential Properties Real Estate Investment Trust, rose 1.25 per cent to €1.215 after reporting a higher than expected increase in net asset value. Hotel group Dalata added 1.4 per cent to close at €4.48. International packaging group Smurfit Kappa climbed 1.15 per cent to €25.545 on signs that its industry is increasing prices. Insulation maker Kingspan added 1.47 per cent to €29.445. The group is due to publish its 2016 results on Friday. Ryanair was up 0.8 per cent at €14.475 as the carrier benefitted from positive sentiment towards the sector on Wednesday. Betting giant Paddy Power Betfair tumbled 2.3 per cent to €98.30 after a note on the sector from HSBC downgraded the stock to “hold” from “buy”. LONDON The UK banking index rose 1.5 per cent to an 18-month high, helped by a 1.2 to 2.1 per cent rise in RBS, Standard Chartered, HSBC and Lloyds on news of Ms Yellen’s interest rate stance. The mining index, up 0.5 per cent, was also among the top gainers. Shares in BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Anglo American advanced 0.3 to 2 per cent. Elsewhere, construction company Ashtead was up 2.5 per cent, while insurers Prudential and Legal & General increased more than 1 per cent. ADVERTISEMENT Tour operator TUI was the biggest loser on the index, down 7.2 per cent on profit taking after its results led to a jump on Tuesday. The stock erased its gains made in the previous session. Gambling firms Ladbrokes and William Hill were under pressure, however, down 3.2 and 2.8 per cent, after HSBC cut its ratings on both stocks to “reduce” from “hold”. EUROPE European shares ended higher in another session dominated by earnings, as French lender Credit Agricole led banking stocks to a three-week high. Shares in Credit Agricole jumped 4.7 per cent after France’s biggest retail bank beat forecasts with a smaller than expected earnings drop in the fourth quarter. The reaction was particularly positive to results from Credit Agricole’s French retail bank unit LCL, which analysts at Jefferies said had been an ongoing concern for some investors. Earnings also helped more broadly, with Finnish packaging maker Huhtamaki rising 8.7 per cent after reporting results, the top gainer on the STOXX 600 index. Heineken rallied 3.7 per cent after confirming its margin target. Swiss software provider Temenos dropped 3.4 per cent after reporting results and announcing a proposal to acquire Australia’s Rubik Financial. Insurer Ageas, medical equipment firm Gerresheimer and paints and coatings company Akzo Nobel were also all weaker after reporting results. NEW YORK Wall Street rose on Wednesday, with the S&P on course for a streak-day winning streak for the first time since September 2013. Procter & Gamble jumped 3.7 per cent to a two-year high of $91.10, giving the biggest boost to the Dow and the S&P, after Trian Fund disclosed a stake, which could pressure the company to cut costs and under-performing divisions. Shares of Southwest, United Continental, American Airlines and Delta rose between 2 per cent and 3.7 per cent after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway reported investments topping $2.1 billion in each of the carriers. AIG weighed the most on the S&P, dropping 8.6 per cent after the commercial insurer reported a larger than expected quarterly loss. – (Additional reporting: Reuters)       Topics: Janet Yellen Federal Reserve TRUST AIG Akzo Nobel American Airlines Anglo American Ashtead BHP Billiton Bank of Ireland Barclays Berkshire Hathaway Continental Crédit Agricole Dalata Delta HSBC Heineken Huhtamaki Insurer Ageas Jefferies Group Kingspan Ladbrokes Legal & General Group Lloyds of London Paddy Power Permanent TSB Procter and Gamble Prudential RBS Ryanair Smurfit Kappa Standard Chartered Group TUI Temenos Australia Europe London(GB) Rio Tinto United States Read More European stocks complete longest streak of rises since October Irish bond rate converges with France on ‘Frexit’ fears Shares driven upward by mergers and acquisitions Nikkei rises above two-week highs on weaker yen amid Trump talks Bullishness as Trump policies and earnings fuel record highs European shares post weekly gain on strong miners European shares surge following positive Chinese trade data Advances in Europe after major players announce results European shares rise on positive earnings Markets start to focus on European political instability Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Retail & Services Laura Ashley sees profits plunge on falling sales and surging costs Technology Adventure gaming for fans of Norse mythology Rugby Kieran Keane a strong contender be next Connacht coach Economy Lawmakers grill Yellen on interest rates, regulatory policy Sponsored How Concur’s 10-step guide could help streamline your supplier invoice process Would you like customer insight with that?

Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here NEW DELHI: India’s advertising industry will likely grow 13.5% in 2017 as the impact of demonetisation wears off, according to the Pitch Madison Advertising report. Advertising expenditure rose 12.5% to Rs 49,480 crore in 2016 after a drop of Rs 1,650 crore in November-December on account of demonetisation. Spending had increased 17.6% in 2015. The size of the market may swell to Rs 56,152 crore this year, led by a 25% increase in spending on advertising in the digital media, according to the report. “We expect the market to grow by 8% for the period January to April 2017, 14% from May to October 2017 and 24% in November and December 2017,” said Sam Balsara, chairman of advertising and PR agency Madison World. GroupM, India’s biggest media-buying agency, said advertising expenditure will likely expand at 10% in 2017, the slowest pace in three years, with the market picking up from March-April, fuelled by the recovery following demonetisation. GroupM estimated the market will expand to about Rs 61,204 crore from Rs 55,671crore in 2016. According to the Pitch Madison Advertising report, the dominant advertisers during 2016 were FMCG companies, which contributed 32%, followed by auto at 10% and telecom at 8%. Ecommerce contributed 4%. Last year’s growth came on the back of digital media advertising, which expanded 43% to Rs 7,315 crore, equivalent to about 15% of the market. TV continued to dominate the pie and grew by 9%, while print, a close second, increased 7% and radio advertising rose 13%. Hindustan Unilever, Amazon and Procter & Gamble continued to be the top three advertisers in 2016 with HUL the largest, spending more than Rs 2,500 crore, according to the report. Patanjali, Oppo Mobiles and Reliance Jio Infocomm were among the 10 newcomers to the top 50. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 15 February 2017 by Military News DingIt.tv Evolves into Level Up Media LONDON, Feb. 15, 2017 — Since launching in 2015, DingIt.tv has developed as the destination and platform for over 25m monthly users, thousands of content creators and a hub for brands and advertisers wanting to reach a gaming demographic. In H2’16 compared to H1’16, Dingit.tv saw substantial growth in monthly sessions (+63%), time watched (+220%) and revenues (+177%) by focusing on premium, on-demand video rather than live content*. To accelerate growth and to provide additional services to both fans and creators, www. dingIt.tv’s owners have now launched Level Up Media, to build its media and technology business, delivering video content distribution and monetization. Chris Gale, CEO Level Media: „2017 is going to be a very exciting year for our Company. The new brand and mission will allow us to expand our offering in a way that facilitates long-term success for all our contributors, partners and the gaming community as a whole.” For Consumers In addition to www.dingit.tv, which will remain as Level Up Media’s flagship destination, Level Up Media intends to launch two new gaming destination sites in 2017. The new sites will cater to different parts of the gaming community by licensing an extensive library of gaming on-demand video. The first property will be www.TheGamer.tv which will focus on content catering to console and top-tier gaming titles. This will compliment DingIt.tv’s continued focus on eSports and competitive gaming titles. Later in the year Level Up Media plans to launch www.GoGamer.tv, a destination for the next generation of gaming fans, with moderated content specifically selected for viewers under 13. GoGamer.tv will be carefully cultivated as an area for content that appeals to a younger age demographic. All elements and adverts will be vetted to suit that audience. Each site will focus on a slightly different niche of gaming fans, which will allow viewers to find the type of content and community they enjoy more quickly and easily. For Creators Level Up Media will add content to its network from third party creators by paying them a license fee. By paying a license fee rather than a revenue share, Level Up Media separates the creative process and content marketing into two separate partnerships. The goal is to provide creators with a longer term and more reliable revenue stream while also getting greater reach through partners able to promote content. This stability gives creators the confidence to invest in their content and better manage revenue. To make sure the license fee remains reflective of the quality of a creator’s content, it will be reviewed on a regular basis by the Level Up Media team. For most creators, content licensing with Level Up Media will be non-exclusive and therefore allows creators flexibility to grow their audience across multiple platforms. For larger partners, Level Up Media provides a co-branded area on one of Level Up Media’s sites. These „Partner Portals” will act as dedicated hubs for partners to direct their audience and only feature the partners content. Partnership portals are growing at a healthy rate with major new partners already signed include; Splyce, Efrag, Penta Sports, HLTV.org and more. With these partnerships and thousands of smaller contributors, Level Up Media looks to expand its video library to over 25,000 premium gaming clips, across a range of games and genres, by the end of the year. For Publishers Level Up Media will leverage its extensive experience and proprietary technology to both distribute video through EvoPlayer™ and monetize views through its Darwin ad technology. EvoPlayer™ will allow publishers to feature premium gaming content on their site and monetize through pre-roll video ads. EvoPlayer™ will be free to use with a revenue share model that will allow publisher partners to both show engaging gaming content to their audience and gain a new revenue stream. Launching in February with multiple partners signed, the EvoPlayer™ publisher network will complement Level Up Media’s current owned & operated site DingIt.tv. Each owned & operated property will focus on a slightly different niche of gaming fans which will allow Level Up Media to reach a wider demographic, offering extensive publisher, content creator and advertiser opportunities. For advertisers & brands Darwin™, Level Up Media’s proprietary ad monetization technology, currently connects to over 100 active programmatic ad partners offering video inventory to brands including; Activision, HP, Redbull, 20th Century Fox, Adidas and P&G. With the expansion of DingIt.tv to Level Up Media, advertisers will have a single point to access a growing audience of highly engaged, millennial gaming fan. Thanks to utilizing only premium and approved content, brands wanting to work with Level Up Media can be confident their campaigns will only run across brand-safe content; something that is a challenge within the gaming industry. For further information or to get in touch, please visit www.levelupmedia.tv. *dingit.tv moved away from live video in Nov’2016 About Level Up Media: Level Up Media’s mission is to connect the world of gamers, by providing a complete online video platform that supports an entire ecosystem of gamers, creators, brands and publishers. We want to create a vibrant and sustainable media network that supports talented content creators while helping brands and publishers better engage a passionate gamer audience.

The New York-based firm disclosed a $14.9 million position in Goldman Sachs <GS.N> and made a new bet on Bank of America <BAC.N> worth $3.9 million. One of its biggest buys during the last three months of 2016 was a call option on the S&P Select Sector SPDR Fund - Financial Sector worth $72.6 million. A number of asset managers bought into financial stocks during the final months of 2016 after Trump's surprise victory suggested that tax cuts and a reduction of regulatory burdens plus higher interest rates could benefit the financial sector. Soros recently hired UBS executive Dawn Fitzpatrick to be the firm's chief investment officer, putting a woman in charge of his portfolio for the first time. Soros sold his entire stake in Procter & Gamble <PG.N>, while Trian Fund Management bought a stake worth $3.5 billion in the company.
