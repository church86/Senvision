News sign-up Patanjali storms to #2 in Indian FMCG market News, 08 May 2017 Topics Sales & distribution NEW DELHI: Patanjali Ayurved, India's home-grown FMCG brand, has announced earnings of Rs 10,561 crore for FY17, placing it second only to Hindustan Unilever in revenue and well ahead of its other international FMCG rivals. The company, founded in 2006, has soared to become one of the most powerful brands in India, outpacing multinational competitors which have been active in India for decades. (For more, including how the company is building an alternative brand to international competitors, read WARC's exclusive report: Patanjali Ayurved – the rise and rise of India’s homegrown FMCG giant.) According to the Economic Times, Patanjali's most recent revenue announcement of Rs 10,561 crore (over US$1.6bn) for the financial year to March 31 2017 eclipsed the combined revenue of multinational competitors Colgate-Palmolive, GSK Consumer Healthcare and P&G Hygiene and Healthcare, and catapults the company ahead of Nestle India for FMCG revenue in India. In an exclusive interview with WARC earlier this year, Patanjali's Head of Marketing, Avinash Kumar, was very confident the company would smash revenue targets: "We don't look at the past, we only look at the future. The only threat we fear is complacency, that is our only competition," he said. "We have the bandwidth to be successful across all categories. We have a team of champions. We get the job done." Patanjali's biggest concern, Kumar said, is that it might not be able to keep up with booming demand for its products, particularly in the oral care category. "We have different worries. Our worry is that our customers look for our products and we are not able to service them," he said. The company is now looking to hit Rs 20,000 crore in sales this fiscal year as it plans to double its distribution network to 12,000-strong. With an aggressive pricing strategy and a TV advertising focus, Patanjali has opened up new markets, previously untouched – and they are not worried about the competition. "We don't discuss multinationals or anybody for that matter, and there is a reason behind it," Kumar said in his interview with WARC. "We have decided hum apni line badi karenge, humme doosron ki line chhoti karne mein koi interest nahin. And sabse badi baat hai ki woh pareshan hain, hum pareshan nahin hain! [We have decided that we will strengthen our own line, we have no interest in reducing the line of others. The biggest thing is, they are worried, we aren't!]" Data sourced from Economic Times; additional content by WARC staff Sign up for daily news Latest News Indians strongly prefer personalised ads News Patanjali storms to #2 in Indian FMCG market News YouTube enlists stars for original shows News Young agency executives doubt video metrics News New Telefónica app gives rewards for data News P&G seeks flexible programmatic buying News Why marketing goes wrong News How DTC ads heal consumer malaise View more News and Opinion More from WARC Patanjali Ayurved: The rise and rise of India's homegrown FMCG giant How India’s FMCG giants are approaching omni-channel and big data How FMCG brands are using online video Get a demo Topics Sales & distribution

A Lifebuoy soap ad c. 1900. CBS News Together with his brother James, William Lever founded a soap company known, appropriately enough, as Lever Brothers. The brothers found success with Sunlight Soap, and in the 1890s expanded into the United States, where Lifebuoy Soap became a familiar brand. William Lever's company survived his death, and after later merging with a Dutch company, it was rechristened as Unilever in 1930. Many new products and advertisements followed over the years, including a cheeky 1990s commercial touting all the body parts that can cleaned with Lever 2000 soap. The Lever House, designed by Skidmore Owings Merrill, in New York City.  Philip Scalia/Alamy And it's not just soap. Unilever sells lots of different foods as well, including Hellmann's mayonnaise, Lipton Tea, and Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream. Besides all that, Unilever can also claim credit for a clean break in urban architecture. Lever House, the corporate headquarters it opened in 1952, was the very first modern glass-walled office building to open on Park Avenue in New York City. And though it's since been sold, Lever House remains, and was named a New York landmark in 1982. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The bipartisan legislation would provide clear and equal protections under federal law for all Americans in vital areas of life, like employment, access to public spaces, housing, credit, education, jury service, and federally-funded programs. Today, in a majority of U.S. states (31), LGBTQ people remain at risk of being fired, evicted or denied services because of who they are. 'No person's fundamental rights should be determined by which side of a state line they live on,' said HRC President Chad Griffin. 'The Equality Act will once and for all end the unacceptable patchwork of non-discrimination laws across this country that leaves LGBTQ people at risk. Every American should have a fair chance to earn a living, provide for their families, and live their lives without fear of discrimination. And at its core, that's what the Equality Act is all about.' Discrimination is a real and persistent problem for far too many LGBTQ Americans. HRC polling has found that nearly two-thirds of self-identified LGBTQ Americans report experiencing discrimination - including people like Carter Brown, a transgender man from Texas who lost his job after he was outed by his colleagues. Currently, 50 percent of LGBTQ Americans like Mr. Brown live in states where they are at risk of being fired, denied housing, or refused service because of who they are. There is no federal law explicitly protecting LGBTQ people from discrimination, and 31 states still lack fully-inclusive non-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people. Today's announcement included unprecedented support from the business community: 92 major corporations have now joined HRC's Business Coalition for the Equality Act. While the overwhelming majority of America's leading businesses have already started addressing workplace fairness for LGBTQ employees, these major employers know how important the need is for a federal standard that treats all employees the same no matter which state they live in. The slate of companies endorsing the Equality Act have combined operations in all 50 states, headquarters spanning 23 states, and collectively generate $2.6 trillion in revenue. In total, these companies employ more than 5.8 million people across the United States. The overwhelming majority of Americans support full federal equality for LGBTQ people. Polling released last year by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) found that support for a bill like the Equality Act topped 70 percent nationally, including a majority of Democrats, Republicans and Independents. PRRI's groundbreaking survey included 42,000 interviews in 50 states and found majority support for the Equality Act in all 50 states. The Equality Act is co-sponsored by 240 members of Congress. It was first introduced in 2015 by Representative David Cicilline (D-RI) and by Senators Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Cory Booker (D-NJ).
